About the Author(s)
Connie Isbell, the author of Rabbit Adoption For Dummies, grew up in rural 
New York State, where she spent time with creatures of all kinds — companion, 
farm, and wild alike. Connie carried this interest in animals and nature into 
her work as an editor and writer for Audubon magazine. She has also edited 
countless pet books, on everything from adopting an ex-racing greyhound 
to caring for rabbits and parrots. Connie now works from her home on the 
coast of New Jersey, where she lives with her husband, two daughters, and 
an assortment of pets.
Audrey Pavia is a former pet magazine editor and an award-winning freelance 
writer specializing in animal subjects. She has written articles on various 
rabbit topics in Rabbits, Critters, and Pet Product News magazines. She has 
authored 21 other animal books besides Rabbits For Dummies, including the 
Owners Guide to the Rabbit.
Audrey has been involved with rabbits since the age of 10, when she fi rst 
joined her local 4-H rabbit project. She currently resides in Norco, California, 
with her husband, two Rex rabbits, and a house full of other pets.

Although they may seem like simple little creatures, rabbits are actually 
physically and emotionally complex and they never cease to amaze those 
who live with them.
If you’re interested in rabbits, you came to the right book. Whether you’re 
thinking about getting your first rabbit or you already have a bunny and want 
to find out more about how to take care of him, this book can be a great help.
How hard is owning a rabbit? Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is designed to 
be a useful reference for those who aren’t experts, as well as those who know 
zero about rabbits. Even people who know a thing or two about bunnies can 
benefit from this book because it’s a reference for behavior and health.
Rabbits are nothing like cats and dogs, the two most common pets. The rab-
bit’s digestive system is more akin to a horse than a feline or a canine. And 
the psychological makeup of a bunny is closer to that of a bird than that of a 
cat or dog.
In order to understand your rabbit and care for him properly, you have to 
know the details specific to rabbit ownership. By finding out about rabbit 
psychology, rabbit physiology, and basic rabbit care, you’ll have what it 
takes to take care of a rabbit just right.
About This Book
Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is like a department store: You’re able to 
enter on whatever floor you like. You don’t have to walk past that smelly per-
fume counter to get to the housewares section on the third floor. You just walk 
into the housewares section. Likewise, you don’t have to start reading this 
book at the beginning, going through each page until you reach the end. You 
can turn to any section of the book that interests you and begin reading at that 
point and not feel lost. You don’t have to remember what you read yesterday, 
and you don’t have to read chapters or sections in order. Just find something 
that interests you, read it, do it, and put the book back on your shelf. (No one

Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
expects you to read from cover to cover except maybe your high school 
English teacher, but you can ignore her this time around.)
Each part of the book is divided into chapters that address basic questions 
about rabbits and their care. You’ll find answers to questions like
 
✓ Am I really cut out to be a bunny owner?
 
✓ How do I prepare my home for my rabbit’s arrival?
 
✓ How do I communicate with my bunny?
 
✓ What’s the best way to make sure that my rabbit is healthy and happy?
 
✓ What do I do in the event of a medical emergency?
Conventions Used in This Book
Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd edition, makes information easy to find and use. To 
help you navigate through the text, we’ve used certain conventions:
 
✓ Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that 
are defined.
 
✓ Boldfaced text is used to bring attention to key words or highlight 
points in a series.
 
✓ Monofont is used to set apart Web sites and e-mail addresses.
In this book, we refer to rabbits with the male pronouns (he, his, him) and 
the female pronouns (she, her). This convention is merely for readability’s 
sake. We don’t call rabbits “it” because they’re living creatures.
What You’re Not to Read
From time to time in this book, we share information that may be interesting 
but isn’t essential to the complete understanding of the topic at hand. You 
can find this nonessential information in two places:
✓ Sidebars: The gray shaded text boxes contain supplementary informa-
tion that you can skip or read later.
✓ Technical Stuff: Paragraphs highlighted with the Technical Stuff icon 
contain technical rabbit facts and tidbits that are interesting but not 
required reading.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
In writing Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition, we made some assumptions 
about our readers:
 
✓ You know a rabbit when you see one.
 
✓ You’re one of the many people who think about adopting a cute, fur ball 
of rabbitness, but you want to make sure that a rabbit is the right pet for 
you and your family.
 
✓ You’re lucky enough to own a rabbit, but you want to be certain 
that you’re doing all you can to properly care for him.
 
✓ You care about rabbits and want to treat them with kindness, especially 
when it comes to housing them in your home.
 
✓ You’re allowed to keep rabbits in the area where you live.
 
✓ You know that the best way to find out about things is to read about 
what the experts have to say on the subject.
 
✓ You’re no dummy, despite the title of this book. In fact, you’re pretty 
smart — otherwise, you wouldn’t have bought this book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is put together in a way that allows you to find the information you 
need quickly and easily. Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is divided into five 
parts made up of several chapters relating to that specific rabbit topic.
Part I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
Before you even get a rabbit, you need to know what rabbits are all about. 
This part offers information about whether a rabbit is right for your lifestyle, 
how rabbits are put together, how to go about choosing a rabbit, and the 
best places to find one.

Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts
Housing, grooming, and feeding — these three important elements for keeping 
a rabbit are all covered in this part of the book. You can find out why rabbits 
are happier and healthier as indoor pets, how to litter box train your house 
rabbit, why keeping your pet clean and groomed is so important, and how best 
to feed your bunny.
Because rabbits are prone to illness, bunny healthcare is an important 
matter. In this part, you can find out how to recognize common rabbit ill-
nesses, how to prevent them, and when to go to the vet. You also get help 
putting together a bunny first-aid kit, and you discover how to handle rabbit 
emergencies. Finally, this part discusses how to say the final goodbye when 
that inevitable moment comes.
Part III: Rabbit Psychology: 
Behavior and Training
Rabbit personality is what makes living with a bunny so much fun. Find 
out how to understand bunny body language. (They can’t speak English.) 
Discover helpful tips on training, as well as how to train your pet to do a few 
fun tricks. This part also includes invaluable information on how to deal with 
common behavior problems, such as biting, chewing, and digging.
Part IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny
Think rabbits don’t do much except sit in a cage all day? Wrong! You can 
have all kinds of fun with your rabbit. Part IV discusses playing with him, get-
ting involved in rabbit clubs and shows, and even traveling with him. This 
part also covers the unique sport of rabbit hopping, along with details on 
how to get involved with rabbit social issues.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, we tackle three different subjects: health emergencies, 
useful rabbit Web sites, and ways of enhancing a pet rabbit’s life. In the 
health chapter, you find an overview of the ten signs that require emergency 
action. Follow the advice, and your rabbit is likely to live a long, healthy life. 
Chapter 18 has the best links on the Internet for rabbit lovers. And last but 
not least, the final chapter offers ten ways to make your bunny’s day special.

 Introduction
Appendix
The Appendix in this book contains a plethora of rabbit resources, includ-
ing rabbit rescue groups, purebred rabbit clubs and registries, rabbit activ-
ity groups, educational organizations, rabbit publications, and other useful 
resources for rabbit owners.
Icons Used in This Book
As with all the other books in the For Dummies series, this book has useful 
little icons in the margins to call your attention to specific types of informa-
tion. See the following explanations of what each of those icons means:
 
You see this icon throughout this book because when it comes to rabbits, you 
need to do plenty of remembering. We place this icon next to important infor-
mation that you won’t want to miss or forget.
 
When you see this symbol, beware! This icon highlights information about 
dangers that can cause your rabbit harm.
 
Occasionally, rabbit information gets a bit technical, hence this icon. When 
you see it, put the left side of your brain in high gear. But if you’re short on 
time, know that this information is interesting but not essential.
 
This icon alerts you to helpful hints regarding rabbits, pertaining to their care 
and handling. If you read the information next to this icon, you’ll have a hap-
pier, healthier rabbit.
Where to Go from Here
Go wherever you want. You can start at Chapter 1 and read all the way 
through to the final appendix, or you can hop, skip, and jump around — 
much like a rabbit.
If you’re going to do that skipping around thing, can we at least ask you for a 
favor? Before you start jumping from place to place, take a few moments to read

Rabbits For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
through Chapter 1, which contains the most important questions you want to 
ask yourself before you embark on the responsibility of rabbit ownership:
 
✓ If you’re considering getting a rabbit, hop over to Chapter 1.
 
✓ If you’ve decided that you’re going to buy a rabbit, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 
help you find the right one.
 
✓ If you already have a rabbit or two and want to get the latest perspective 
on a healthy bunny diet, see Chapter 6.
 
✓ If you want to train your rabbit, Chapter 12 can help you.

you started.

Part I
Bringing on the 
Bunny Basics

In this part . . .
I
f you’re just starting out with a rabbit, you need the 
basics. This part gives them to you. You find details 
on how to tell whether a rabbit is the right pet for you, 
the different breeds and types of rabbits available, the 
benefits of adopting a rabbit who needs a home, and how 
to find a healthy rabbit. You also see details about how 
the rabbit’s body works and receive pointers on how to 
choose the right rabbit for you.

Chapter 1
Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out about rabbits before you get one
▶ Discovering the realities of rabbit ownership
▶ Examining your rabbit readiness
▶ Parceling out duties to family members
T
he two most common pets in North America, if not the world, are cats 
and dogs. Rabbits, on the other hand, aren’t as common (although they 
have enjoyed a recent rise in popularity and now rank fourth after cats, dogs, 
and birds). As a result, many folks don’t know too much about them.
Rabbits are complicated creatures, both physically and psychologically. In 
addition to a uniquely designed social structure, their bodies have helped 
them to survive as a species for eons. As the caregiver to one of these special 
animals, it behooves you to understand the inner workings of the rabbit. If 
you do, you’ll not only be able to take better care of your pet, but you’ll also 
have a greater appreciation for this special member of the animal kingdom. 
(See Chapters 9 and 10 for more information about the health of your rabbit.)
Because they’re so misunderstood, rabbits are the unfortunate victims of 
much neglect, mostly by well-intentioned folks who simply weren’t properly 
suited or prepared for sharing their lives and homes with these fine long-eared 
creatures. In addition to providing a primer on the rabbit form, this chapter 
guides you through the process of looking at your own life and how well a 
rabbit might fit into it. Those who fit the rabbit profile are fortunate, indeed.
Admiring from Afar
Rabbits are mammals, which means that they’re in the same general clas-
sification as dogs, cats, horses, sheep, tigers, elephants, humans, and a lot of 
other animals. To be a mammal means that you’re warm blooded — that is, 
your body regulates its own temperature (as opposed to a reptile who needs 

10
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
an outside heat source to maintain its body temperature). Your species also 
gives birth to live young and nurses them with milk produced by mammary 
glands (hence the name mammal).
The rabbit’s body, shown in Figure 1-1, is uniquely designed in large part to 
escape predators. The rabbit is also put together in a way that helps him take 
in food, which in turn provides energy for escape and reproduction.
Digesting this information 
(and that carrot)
One of the most interesting aspects of a rabbit’s body is his digestive system. 
Unlike cats or dogs, rabbits can eat a wide variety of plant material. They can 
process and extract nutrients from many plants that are indigestible to less 
adaptable herbivores or omnivores. This flexibility helps make them highly 
successful in a variety of environments around the world. Understanding 
how your rabbit’s digestive system functions is important so that you feed 
him in a way that’s most efficient for his body. (For more on feeding your 
rabbit, see Chapter 6.)

 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
Rabbits have a large stomach for their body size to enable them to eat large 
amounts of plant material quickly. They are crepuscular, meaning they eat 
primarily at dawn and at dusk. They don’t need to eat small amounts all day 
long. They graze primarily in the morning and evening with little food intake 
during the rest of the day, depending on what’s available, the weather, and so 
on. Rabbits can do nicely eating a large meal twice a day.
The digestive process begins in the rabbit’s mouth. The rabbit’s prehensile 
lips grab the plant material first, and then the front teeth called incisors — 
four upper and two lower — neatly slice off pieces of plant matter. The food 
is then passed to the molars (the back teeth), where it’s chewed into small 
particles and finally swallowed.
 
All of the rabbit’s teeth grow continuously throughout its life. If he’s on a 
good diet, like the one described in Chapter 6, and is given some additional 
materials to munch on throughout the day, your rabbit is less likely to pick 
something else to eat, such as your couch legs, your bed legs, or your legs. 
(Chapter 14 lists some fun toys for rabbits.)
 
Rabbits have a very large blind sac called a cecum that is located where the 
small intestine and the large intestine join together. The cecum contains a 
wonderfully diverse population of healthy bacteria, yeast, and other organ-
isms working to help the rabbit digest his food.
When the food in the small intestine reaches the cecum and large intestine, 
the gastrointestinal tract knows which materials to divert into the cecum for 
further break down. The materials that were already digested in the small 
intestine and that don’t need to make this little side trip to the cecum pass 
directly into the large intestine as waste. This waste then leaves the body as 
the little round droppings you see in your rabbit’s litter box.
Munching on fiber
Rabbits are herbivores, meaning that they dine 
only on plant material. A rabbit has an esopha-
gus, stomach, and intestinal tract like other 
mammals. However, because they often dine on 
plants that are high in fiber, rabbits have devel-
oped a strategy for dealing with the high fiber 
foods called hind gut fermentation. This area of 
the digestive system is where the indigestible 
materials are broken down into manageable 
chemicals. (We talk more about this interest-
ing process in a minute.) Many other herbivore 
friends, including horses, guinea pigs, and chin-
chillas, have this specialization of the digestive 
system.

12
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
What is happening in the cecum? The microorganisms are breaking down 
the indigestible fiber and turning it into digestible nutrients. In order for the 
rabbit to use these nutrients, he must take this material and move it through 
the digestive tract one more time. So, at certain times of the day (which coin-
cides with several hours after a rabbit eats a big meal), the material from the 
cecum is packaged up into small round moist pellets called cecotropes. The 
rabbit gets a signal in his brain about when these little delicacies are ready to 
be passed out of the body; he eats them the minute they emerge. Your rabbit 
will often look like he is grooming his hind end, but actually he is taking in 
these nutrient-rich cecotropes.
 
The various types of fiber in a rabbit’s diet is not only there to be used for 
nutrition, but they’re vital to keeping the rabbit’s gastrointestinal tract in excel-
lent working order. The indigestible fiber is particularly important in making 
the intestines move along smoothly. You can think of the fiber as a tool to 
sort of “tickle” the lining and keep things moving smoothly. A diet that is low 
in appropriate types of fiber and too high in rich carbohydrates can lead to a 
sluggish intestine and cecum and subsequent serious disease (see Chapter 9).
 
Normally you will not see any cecotropes in your rabbit’s cage or at the most 
a rare one here or there. They’re soft, green to brown, mucous coated, and 
have a stronger smell. If you see a number of them in your rabbit’s cage, it 
may indicate a diet too rich in protein or another more serious condition. 
Please consult your vet.
Taking advantage of skin and bones
Watch rabbits run and leap in play, and you get a sense of the complexity 
and flexibility of their skeletons and muscles. Nature equipped rabbits with 
this kind of flexibility to allow them to make lifesaving maneuvers when being 
chased down by predators. Basically, the rabbit’s bones and muscles are 
what keep it ahead of the game.
 
Unfortunately, poor diet, inadequate housing, lack of exercise, and improper 
handling can be a deadly combination for rabbits. Accidental injuries to the 
spine can occur in any rabbit, but are extremely rare in rabbits on proper 
diets who get plenty of exercise to strengthen bones and supporting muscles.

13
 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
For this reason, it’s important that
 
✓ Rabbits who are outdoors for a period of exercise must be well pro-
tected from predators. (See Chapter 8 for more information about out-
door safety.)
 
✓ You handle your rabbit properly (see Chapter 7). Incorrect handling or 
lifting can result in serious, if not fatal, injury.
 
Rabbits are excellent swimmers, but taking them for a dip in the pool with you 
isn’t a good idea. Although the rabbit’s skeleton and muscles allow it to swim 
effectively, swimming is reserved for life-and-death escapes. Needless to say, 
your bunny won’t enjoy any excursions in the pool.
Taking a whiff
Rabbit noses are always on the go. They wiggle almost incessantly. Although 
much of this wiggling is a result of the rabbit’s rapid breathing, it also helps 
facilitate taking in certain odors when the rabbit needs to do so. Rabbits can 
tell much about a situation just by taking a good whiff.
 
Rabbits are like cats and dogs in that their olfactory sense gives them access 
to an entire unique world that humans aren’t privy to. Rabbits can smell even 
the faintest odor and use their noses to do the following:
 
✓ Distinguish one rabbit from another or one sex from another.
 
✓ In the case of males, find out whether a female rabbit is ready to breed.
 
✓ In the case of a mother rabbit, identify her own babies.
 
✓ Determine whether they want to eat a particular food.
 
✓ Detect danger from predators and from weather conditions.
 
Also, given your rabbit’s sensitivity in the olfactory department, refrain from 
using harsh chemicals, perfume, or anything particularly strong smelling in his 
presence or around his cage. His nose will thank you for it.
Putting those ears to good use
Rabbits haven’t survived for eons just on their good looks. Their profound 
sense of hearing has served them well over time. (For a prey animal like 
the rabbit, being able to hear predators approaching and detect the warning 
thumps of other rabbits is crucial to the colony, a group of rabbits living 
together in a warren, a series of dens and tunnels.)

14
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
The shape of a rabbit’s ears allows them to pick up barely detectable sounds 
in its environment, sort of like radar dishes. The large exteriors intercept 
sounds and funnel them into the ear canal where the ear drum is located. 
Rabbit ears are also flexible. They can pivot around at the base to help detect 
the exact location where a sound is coming from.
 
What does all this great hearing mean to you, the rabbit owner? Be aware of 
the sensitivity of your rabbit’s ears and treat him accordingly. Spare him loud 
music, screaming children, barking dogs, and any other nerve-frazzling racket. 
Your rabbit is less stressed if his environment is free of harsh, jarring noises.
 
Rabbits also use their ears to release excess body heat. Applying cool wet 
cloths to his ears (if he hasn’t gone into shock already) can help cool down an 
overheated rabbit. Thus, cool blood circulates through his body and lowers 
his body temperature. (For more on heatstroke, see Chapter 9.)
Figuring Out Whether a 
Rabbit is Right for You
Rabbits are cute and fuzzy and make great pets, but these truths alone aren’t 
good enough reasons to own one. If rabbits are so wonderful, why not have 
one? The answer is simple: Though rabbits are terrific companions for many 
reasons, they also demand plenty of work and a serious commitment.
For example, Sarah works eight hours a day at an office job and spends 
another hour a day commuting back and forth to work. She’s gone from her 
home a good nine hours a day, and that’s on the days when she comes right 
home from work. Often, Sarah, who is single, meets her girlfriends after work 
or heads off to the gym to exercise. On those nights, she doesn’t get home 
until 9 or 10 p.m. Because Sarah’s schedule doesn’t give her enough time to 
spend with a dog, she opted for a rabbit. A rabbit, however, is a very social 
animal and will be just as unhappy as a dog in this situation.
Asking yourself whether 
you’re rabbit-ready
Fantasizing about owning a rabbit is quite different from actually being ready 
to take one on. Think hard about your lifestyle and whether it’s the right time 
to be adding such an animal to your household. Ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ Do I have at least three hours of free time a day? Your rabbit needs at 
least two hours of exercise, which we describe in Chapters 15 and 17. 

15
 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
That leaves another hour to clean his hutch and to groom, feed, and water 
him. Are you embroiled in something right now that’s taking up much of 
your time or energy, like the holiday season, a move, or a personal tran-
sition, such as a baby, a new marriage, or a divorce? Are you putting in 
long hours at work on a special project? Do you travel often for work?
 
 Adding a new pet to the household during an already stressful time can 
be disastrous for all involved. Wait until things settle down and are back 
to normal. That’s the time to bring a new rabbit into the home.
 
✓ Do I have the space to house a rabbit? Can I put him in my yard or in my 
house? Does my apartment complex allow pets? Rabbits require adequate 
cage space (see Chapter 5 for more information), and you must have the 
room to accommodate this need. You must also do some investigating 
to find out whether you’re zoned for rabbit ownership. Rabbits aren’t 
allowed in some residential areas. Check with your local zoning board.
 
✓ Does anyone in my household have allergies? Those who have aller-
gies know how miserable and even debilitating they can be. Chapter 5 
offers some tactics to minimize the evil effects of bunny-related aller-
gens (rabbit fur, rabbit saliva, rabbit hay, and so on), but people who 
have serious allergies may want to spend some time with rabbits before 
making the decision to adopt.
 
✓ Can my kids handle the responsibility? Kids and rabbits can make fine 
companions, providing the children are old enough to respect the rabbit 
and are properly supervised; the general consensus is 7 years of age, but 
all children should be considered individually. Mishandling can result in 
serious injury or even death of the rabbit. Likewise, rabbits who kick — or 
even bite — when held improperly can hurt children. See Chapter 7 for a 
more detailed discussion of how to properly handle a rabbit.
 
 Give serious thought to whether your children are old enough to behave 
responsibly around a rabbit and whether you have the time to prop-
erly supervise their interaction time with the new pet. Children can’t be 
expected to be in sole charge of the rabbit. In fact, an adult must oversee 
the rabbit-caring tasks that children are given for the sake of the rabbit.
 
✓ How will my other pets get along with a rabbit? Rabbits can get along with
other pets, depending on the type of pet they’re being asked to live 
with. Introducing your pet rabbit to another strange rabbit may jeopar-
dize one or both pets, putting them in serious danger. (Chapters 2 and 11 
offer tips for how rabbits can coexist with other pets peacefully.)
 
✓ Am I willing to alter my lifestyle? Rabbits are notorious diggers and 
chewers and can make short work of your backyard or your wooden fur-
niture legs if you don’t make certain changes to your home environment. 
You have to thoroughly rabbit-proof your home and/or backyard if you 
bring a rabbit into your life. And in many cases, the results of your rabbit-
proofing won’t exactly be an asset to your home decor. (Chapter 5 can 
help you figure out how to rabbit-proof your home.)

16
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
 
✓ Do I have enough money to set up and sustain my rabbit? You need 
cold, hard cash (or a warm credit card) to purchase any rabbit, plus the 
cage and supplies that your rabbit must have to be comfortable. You 
should also have money on hand to pay veterinary bills for the annual 
preventative physical exam, in the event of an illness, and the health 
difficulties that becomes more likely as the pet ages. (See Chapters 9 
and 10 for details on rabbit health.)
 
✓ Am I ready for the emotional commitment? Rabbits are friendly, socia-
ble creatures who need plenty of attention to thrive in a domestic envi-
ronment. Think about whether you can make the emotional commitment 
to a rabbit.
 
What happens if you don’t ask yourself these questions and just go out and 
get a rabbit because you think you want one? If it turns out that rabbit owner-
ship isn’t really right for you, then the rabbit will ultimately suffer. Typically, 
when people don’t want their rabbits, they end up taking them to an animal 
shelter or turning them loose in the woods in the hopes that the rabbit can get 
by on its own. Sadly, rabbits are put to death in animal shelters, just like their 
canine and feline counterparts, and domesticated rabbits that are set free to 
fend for themselves are rarely capable of doing so. Finding another home for 
him is an option but not an easy one. Prospective rabbit owners don’t grow on 
trees, as you’ll quickly find out when you start trying to find another home for 
your rabbit. So spare yourself and the rabbit all the heartache and probe deep 
into your psyche before taking the plunge.
Considering the right reasons 
to own a rabbit
People are drawn to rabbits for different reasons. Most of them think rabbits 
are cute (and they’re right). Others want to breed and show them for enjoy-
ment and prestige. Some are looking for a pet that’s less work than a dog yet 
different from a cat. The fact that rabbits are cute and fuzzy may motivate 
you to explore the possibility of rabbit ownership. But before you acquire 
a rabbit, you need to find out as much as you can about rabbits and what’s 
involved. Only then can you have a thorough understanding of rabbit owner-
ship really means. This book can help you do that.
 
The only truly legitimate reasons to get a rabbit are for companionship and/or 
to get seriously involved in the purebred rabbit community. Any other reason 
bodes trouble — for the rabbit.

17
 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
Check out the following few reasons not to own a rabbit:
 
✓ It’s Easter time, and you think getting a rabbit would be a fun way to 
celebrate the holiday.
 
✓ You think a rabbit would look good sitting in a hutch outside in your 
backyard. A bunny in the yard may lend a rural feeling to your garden 
decor.
 
✓ You want to breed rabbits, so you can make a pile of money.
 
✓ Your child wants one, and you plan to teach him responsibility by 
making him care for the rabbit.
 
✓ Your dog needs a companion, but you don’t want to get another dog.
If these reasons don’t apply to you, then you may be one of the fortunate 
folks who are suited for a life with rabbits. Of course, before you go out and 
get that rabbit, make sure that you did your homework and know exactly how 
to take care of this delightful creature. (See Part II in this book for more on 
housing, nutrition, and healthcare.) Find out about rabbit breeds to make 
sure that you know what kind of rabbit you want. Study up on rabbit behav-
ior so that you can understand your pet right from the get-go and be sure to 
make that all-important decision about whether your rabbit will live indoors 
or outdoors before you bring your pet home. (They should live indoors.) Find 
a veterinarian experienced in the treatment of rabbits before you make your 
purchase rather than after an emergency arises.
The downside of the Easter Bunny
Easter is a time of joy for children everywhere, 
but for those running rabbit rescue groups and 
shelters, Easter is nothing to celebrate. In their 
holiday excitement, many people impulsively 
buy a cute pet bunny for their children. Sadly, a 
family’s enthusiasm quickly wanes after these 
little bunnies turn into teenage rabbits, when a 
variety of troublesome but natural behaviors 
emerge (see Chapter 2). It’s not long until chil-
dren lose interest and parents tire of the chores. 
Enter those rescue groups and shelters. This 
annual deluge of unwanted rabbits is an event 
that organizers and volunteers dread. Faced 
with an overwhelming number of rabbits, many 
groups are forced to euthanize — certainly not 
what the Easter Bunny had in mind.

Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
Knowing What You Want 
in a Furry Friend
Like many other animal companions, rabbits come in all shapes, sizes, and 
colors — not to mention breeds, ages, and gender. Some people are happy 
with whatever rabbit needs a home, which is great for rabbits at shelters who 
need adopting. Other people may have a particular rabbit in mind. It’s good to 
remember, however, that when it comes to living with a rabbit, what matters 
most is personality — and that has little or nothing to do with breed or color.
That being said, you have to consider a variety of options when it comes to 
choosing a rabbit:
 
✓ Mixed breed or purebred: If you’re not interested in breeding or show-
ing, a mixed breed bunny is likely to do the trick. Chapters 2 and 3 pro-
vide loads of information about the differences between bunny mixed 
and the many recognized breeds of purebred rabbits available.
 
✓ Age: Although rabbits of all ages can be wonderful companions, it’s a 
good idea to understand a bit about the challenges that typically come 
with babies, teenagers, and even older rabbits. Chapter 2 has the details.
 
✓ Gender: Ask rabbit people whether they prefer male or female rabbits, 
and you’ll hear great arguments for both. See Chapter 2 for some of the 
conventional wisdom about differences in gender.
 
✓ Coat type: With rabbits, coat type comes down to this question: 
Longhair or shorthair? Your answer should be based on how much time 
you have for grooming. Read more about the coat types in Chapter 2 and 
the grooming involved in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Size: The question of size can matter for those who have children or 
who have physical limitations when it comes to lifting. (Rabbits don’t 
care much for being carried, but it will have to be done.) Although you 
may think a smaller rabbit would be best for a child, the opposite is in 
fact true: Small rabbits are too fragile, really, for most children; a larger, 
sturdier rabbit is a better bet for most families with kids. Chapter 2 has 
more on size considerations.
Providing Shelter
Not just any home will do for a rabbit. All rabbits deserve safe, comfortable, 
and inviting accommodations. Responsible rabbit caretakers will

✓ Set up house indoors: Rabbits are increasingly being brought in from 
lonely outdoor hutches so that they can live indoors with their human 
companions. Indoor living is a brilliant idea for many reasons: better 
health, a longer life, protection from predators, and more fun for all. Read 
Chapter 5 for more on this happy trend for bunnies and their humans.
 
✓ Get equipped ahead of time: Rabbits require some basic equipment, 
including a cage, nest box, litter box, as well as food and water vessels. 
Chapter 5 outlines a basic shopping list to guide you in your interior 
design efforts.
 
✓ Take care of rabbit-proofing: To create a successful indoor living situation, 
you must first take precautions to protect your home from your rabbit 
and your rabbit from your home. Chapter 5 details those measures, which 
involve electrical cords, furniture, and carpeting.
Feeding Your Rabbit
This chapter’s earlier “Admiring From Afar” section delves into the fascinat-
ing world of the rabbit gastrointestinal system. Rabbit nutrition is the subject 
of much discussion and debate, leaving many new owners to puzzle over pel-
lets and parsley. Practically speaking, your rabbit’s nutrition is a critical part 
of caring for your rabbit. Chapter 6 covers this topic in detail, but here’s a 
glimpse at what’s in store for you and your bunny kitchen:
 
✓ Making hay: Fiber is critically important to a rabbit, and hay is the ulti-
mate in rabbit fiber. The average rabbit should be given an unlimited 
supply of grass hay (such as timothy). Keep it fresh and keep it coming!
 
✓ Keeping it fresh: Leafy greens and some vegetables are another vital 
part of your rabbit’s diet and should be fed daily. Chapter 6 discusses 
those veggies considered to be good for bunnies, as well as recommended 
quantities; fruits, which are high in sugar, should be fed sparingly.
 
✓ Considering pellets: Much of the discussion about rabbit nutrition is 
centered on the subject of pellets. It now appears that alfalfa-based 
pellets, which are convenient and have been used by those breeding 
rabbits, are probably not the best choice for companion rabbits. See 
Chapter 6 for more on this debate, as well as for guidelines for using pel-
lets that are timothy-based as one part of a rabbit’s diet.
 
✓ Tempting with treats: Commercially prepared rabbit treats are the rabbit 
equivalent of junk food, and so are best avoided. Instead, when feeling the 
need to treat your bunny (maybe once a day or during training), opt for a 
bit of fresh fruit. Suggested treats are listed in Chapter 6.

Grooming Your Rabbit
Rabbits are pretty good about taking care of their own grooming and per-
sonal hygiene (that’s what all that licking and preening is about). Most 
human companions need to lend an occasional hand, however, when it 
comes to coat, nail, and ear care. Chapter 7 includes a list of grooming tools 
you should have on hand, as well as guidelines for
 
✓ Brushing: The amount and frequency of brushing you need to do will 
depend on your rabbit’s coat. Longhaired rabbits, such as angoras, often 
require daily brush sessions; short coats, like rexes, may need brushing 
only once or twice a week.
 
✓ Clipping nails: This grooming chore is probably the most intimidating, 
but with a bit of guidance (from a vet) and practice, most owners do fine 
when it comes time to tame unruly rabbit nails. Chapter 7 outlines the 
steps to a successful clip session.
 
✓ Cleaning ears: Making the ears a regular part of the grooming process can 
help detect problems such as ear mites or infection. These are no regular 
ears, however, so treat them with care, as discussed in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Bathing: Rabbits rarely need bathing, which is a good thing because 
rabbits aren’t fond of being bathed, and bathing causes them undo 
stress. Typically, you can handle the need for a bath with a spot treatment 
to clean the offending area (usually the hind end). Keep in mind that rab-
bits are susceptible to cold when they’re wet; Chapter 7 describes 
bathing precautions to prevent your bunny from catching a chill.
Many rabbits don’t like being handled, but grooming will become easier as 
you build a trusting relationship with your rabbit. Chapter 7 also offers tips 
for proper handling and bonding.
Keeping Up with Chores
Having any pet is going to add a certain amount of work to your to-do list 
around the house. Staying on top of chores, such as food prep, cleaning, and 
litter box maintenance, is a critical part of keeping both your home and your 
rabbit healthy and happy.
 
All rabbit owners must do a number of tasks that take time, but you must also 
determine who can perform them. If you live alone, you’ll obviously perform 
them. (No rabbit likes to clean his own litter box.) If you have a family and 
the rabbit will belong to everyone, then tasks must be delegated. Before your 

21
 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
rabbit comes to live with you, sit down with your family and have a meeting. 
Discuss the tasks described in this chapter, as well as who will perform them, 
and when. A written schedule can do wonders to encourage slackers to keep 
up their end of the bargain. This meeting is a great way to find out whether 
your family is committed to owning a rabbit. If they’re not, then you can put 
off any plans for a new pet rabbit and thus spare your family and the rabbit 
from going through the hassle.
However, for the family that’s willing to undertake a few extra chores for the 
sake of a furry new pet, taking care of a rabbit isn’t too hard, especially if 
everyone in the family agrees to pitch in. Table 1-1 has tips on who may best 
be able to perform the various tasks required of rabbit owners. (All these 
tasks are described in detail in Part II.)

Kids of all ages can easily perform this task as long 
as an adult monitors them and makes certain that 
the child is performing this important job. An adult 
should wash and cut up fresh foods for the child’s 
safety and measure out pelleted feed.

Older children can make sure that the rabbit has 
fresh water daily; adult supervision ensures the job 
gets done.
Exercising
Daily
A child of any age can help a rabbit exercise by 
playing with the bunny or simply watching to see 
that the rabbit doesn’t get into anything he isn’t 
supposed to as the rabbit runs around on his own. 
It’s important that adults be the one to lift and carry 
the rabbit if the children are young. Children should 
be monitored when they’re playing with the rabbit 
to ensure that they don’t chase or accidentally hurt 
the bunny in any way.

Depending on the type of cage, an adult or an older 
child should do this job. 
Grooming
Varies 
Adults or older children can tackle this job, which 
entails brushing (daily for longhaired rabbits and 
weekly for others), nail clipping, and ear cleaning.

Monitoring Your Rabbit’s Health
Like any other animal companion, rabbits can become injured, contract dis-
eases, or get infections. Of course, your rabbit is going to be less likely to 
become ill or injured if you follow the advice in this book and provide her 
with a proper diet, a clean home, and plenty of exercise. But even the best 
cared for rabbits can become sick, and your best defense is to be prepared 
for whatever comes your way. You should
 
✓ Find a vet. Don’t delay. Chapter 9 discusses how to find a vet who can 
care for rabbits. If your rabbit is intact, make spaying/neutering a 
primary topic of conversation.
 
✓ Keep up with annual checkups. Even though rabbits don’t require 
annual vaccinations, an annual checkup is a critical part of your rabbit’s 
healthcare regiment.
 
✓ Put together a first-aid kit. Having basic medical supplies on hand may 
mean the difference between a minor health situation and a medical 
emergency. Consult Chapter 9 for how to put together a first-rate first-
aid kit.
 
✓ Be on the lookout for symptoms of illness. The better you know your 
rabbit, the better you’re able to spot unusual behaviors or symptoms 
associated with bunny illnesses. By conducting regular home checkups, 
as described in Chapter 9, you’re more likely to detect problems early on.
 
✓ Respond to issue of aging. Thanks to better care and living conditions, 
house rabbits can live 10 years or longer. Unfortunately, geriatric bunnies 
have their own health problems. Arthritis, kidney disease, cancer, and 
blindness are among the ailments you should look for as your bunny ages.
Training Your Rabbit
Whether it’s to use a litter box, come when called, or stop chewing the carpet, 
training is a rewarding part of living with a house rabbit. Chapter 12 covers 
some basic ideas of training, with stops for training rabbits to do “tricks” like 
sit, jump, and come. Chapter 13 goes a bit deeper into training to cover trou-
blesome behaviors such as kicking and biting. Consider the following:
 
✓ Many “problem behaviors” are simply the result of your bunny acting on 
natural urges — digging, chewing, urinating, for example.
 
✓ Take time to bond with your bunny by “listening” to your rabbit’s body 
language and sounds, which are described in Chapter 11.
 
✓ The success of your training efforts will depend a great deal on how 
good of a trainer you are. Are you consistent? Patient? Firm but kind?

23
 Chapter 1: Jumping into Rabbit Ownership
Though people are surprised to hear it, rabbits are quite capable of being 
litter box trained, which is a goal for many rabbit owners. Most rabbits take 
to litter boxes quite readily, but Chapter 5 outlines the steps to success, with 
advice for those who come across stray pellets in the parlor.
Thinking Like a Bunny
You may love your rabbit, and your rabbit may love you, but underneath your 
bunny’s overt affections, a worried creature still exists. Think about it: For 
thousands of years, humans have hunted rabbits for food and fur. In fact, 
they still do!
The genetic makeup of the wild rabbit enables him to recognize human 
beings as predators. Try walking up to a wild bunny and see what happens. 
Although your pet rabbit is tame and comes from a long line of domesticated 
rabbits, that innate fear of humans still prevails. You can win your bunny over 
to the point where he’s incredibly comfortable with you, but be aware that he’s 
still easily frightened by quick movements, loud noises, and rough handling. In 
fact, some rabbit experts believe that even lifting a rabbit off the ground can be 
terrifying to the animal because this sensation normally comes with being car-
ried off by a predator.
 
For this reason, treat your rabbit gently at all times. You can get more details 
about how to ease your rabbit’s fears and build a trusting relationship by 
reading Chapter 11.
A large part of building that trust will come from reading your bunny’s body 
language and sounds. Whether he has an urgent message or is just being 
social creature that he is, your rabbit has a lot to say! Chapter 11 describes 
the sounds and movements you’ll come to recognize and understand.
Having a Good Time with Your Pet
Living with a rabbit is so much more than chores, rabbit-proofing, and 
training — be sure to make time for some fun! Rabbits and their people love 
to have a good time, and they’ve come up with some fairly ingenious ways 
of doing so.
 
✓ Playing games and tossing toys: It’s natural for rabbits to play, but 
many rabbits, especially those confined to a cage for long periods of 
time, may need some encouragement. Toys and games are the perfect 
way to keep bunnies healthy, active, and energized. Get involved in a 
game of tag or take a seat and enjoy the jumps, dashes, and leaps that 

24
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics
follow a session with a new toy. Chapter 14 is loaded with ideas for 
games, as well as for toys, both homemade and store bought.
 
✓ Making friends with other rabbit owners: Like their rabbit companions, 
many rabbit people crave social activity. Some people love their rabbits 
so much that they want to share them with others, and rabbit clubs and 
shows are the perfect outlet. Others go a more philanthropic route and 
volunteer their time with a rescue organization, whether by fostering 
bunnies waiting to be adopting or interviewing prospective adoptees. 
Still others find happiness in rabbit hopping, a sport managed by the 
Rabbit Hopping Association of America. Chapter 15 offers details on all 
of these activities.
 
✓ Traveling when you have a rabbit: For most rabbits, travel is not high 
on their list of fun things to do, but you can make unavoidable trips 
more pleasant for your bunny companion. Safety is first, of course, and 
Chapter 16 offers guidelines for auto and air travel, with tips for finding 
hotels that accept long-eared guests. The chapter also includes helpful 
advice for finding someone who can care for your rabbit at home while 
you’re away.

S
o you’re certain you want a rabbit for a pet, and you’re ready to go out 
and get your bunny. Finding and choosing the rabbit who can ultimately 
be your companion may be one of the most exciting aspects of entering into 
rabbit ownership.
To be honest, this process can also be one of the most daunting parts of get-
ting a rabbit. Is it possible that just one bunny is the perfect match for you? 
Probably not. Even people who’ve had and lost “the best rabbit in the world” 
usually end up with another equally amazing rabbit sooner or later.
A large part of the selection process is deciding whether you want a pure-
bred rabbit or a mixed breed. You have good reasons for choosing each. 
If you’re starting out with only one bunny at first, then you have to make a 
choice.
In choosing your pet, you also have to make decisions about her age, sex, and 
size. Whether you have a particular rabbit in mind or you’re still weighing your 
options, you can discover a lot about the different types of rabbits, which can 
help you through what may be a confusing, even emotional, process.
So, with all the rabbits out there, how do you know which one to get? In this 
chapter, you find out everything you need to know to select the rabbit that’s 
best for you.

26
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Pinpointing the Right Age
Regardless of whether you plan to get a purebred or mixed-breed rabbit, 
you need to think about the age of the rabbit you want. Many rabbits live ten 
years or longer, so you should factor that into your decision-making process. 
Rabbits of all ages can be terrific pets, but it’s helpful to know ahead of time 
about some of the challenges that come with each age.
 
✓ Baby bunnies (younger than three months): Baby bunnies are cute, and 
saying no when you see one is difficult. However, baby bunnies should 
also come with a warning label: Not as easy as they look. Though they’re 
notorious for destructive chewing, the most serious problem associated 
with baby bunnies has to do with their health; combining the stress of 
moving to a new home to the stress of being weaned can result in illness 
and even death. Plus, baby bunnies are, well, babies, and prone to litter 
box accidents. Finally, you can’t be sure what kind of personality your 
baby will have when she grows up. If you’ve considered all these factors 
and still want a young rabbit, look for one — preferably from a shelter 
or rescue group — around 12 weeks old who should be better able to 
adjust to change.
 
✓ Adolescent rabbits (typically 5 to 12 months): Before a baby rabbit can 
become an adult, he must go through the dreaded adolescent stage — the 
rabbit equivalent to being a teenager. Many people prefer to skip this 
rather bratty period in rabbit development by adopting an adult rabbit. 
Keep in mind that these hormonally charged behaviors — chewing, dig-
ging, spraying (see Chapter 13), aggressiveness, and territoriality — are 
part of a phase that should pass or at least diminish. Though not an 
instant fix, spaying or neutering your pet, which we cover in Chapter 9, 
can also help.
 
✓ Adult rabbits (1 year and older): At this point in a rabbit’s life, he has 
probably emerged from adolescence and has mellowed a bit. Without all 
the hormonal surges, you’ll be able to get a good sense of his personal-
ity and temperament. As far as litter box training goes, an adult rabbit is 
not too old to learn new tricks, and many can adapt to indoor life with 
litter boxes.
 
✓ Senior rabbits (generally 4 years and older): Like other senior animals, 
older rabbits may be slowing down, but they’re still a wonderful choice 
for a companion, delighting owners with their curiosity, cuddles, and 
leaps. And take heart, because your older rabbit can still make good use 
of a litter box. Depending on the breed, the average lifespan of a 
companion rabbit is generally between 7 and 12 years.

27
 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
Is it a boy or girl?
Though you’re most likely going to have a vet 
determine your bunny’s sex, knowing how to 
do it yourself can’t hurt. It’s a good idea to be 
sure of your rabbit’s sex because males should 
be kept apart from females, even when they’re 
babies. Rabbits as young as 4 months old are 
capable of reproducing.
To determine your rabbit’s sex
 1. Gently place the rabbit on his back in 
your lap.
 
 If the rabbit panics, let him rest a minute 
and then try it again. If he continues to 
resist, leave this exam up to your vet.
 2. Using your thumb and forefinger, spread 
apart the hair on the area just beneath your 
rabbit’s tail.
 3. Push down gently in this area, and the 
vulva of a female or the penis of a male 
becomes visible.
 
 You can see the difference in the accom-
panying figure. The male is on the left; the 
female is on the right.
Mature males (over 6 months) have scrotal 
sacs with testicles under the tail. They can pull 
the testicles up into the body at times, but you 
can still see the wrinkled area of the sacs.
You can perform this procedure on rabbits as 
young as a few weeks. The older the rabbit, 
however, the easier it is to tell whether you’re 
looking at male or female reproductive organs.

28
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Deciding Between a Boy or Girl
Another decision is whether to get a male or female rabbit. Depending on 
whom you talk to, both genders have their benefits, and the final decision 
is usually a matter of personal choice. Each sex generally has the following 
characteristics:
 
✓ Bucks (males): Having a reputation for being aggressive with people 
and other rabbits, males also tend to be distracted by their constant 
impulses to breed. This generalization isn’t true of every buck, of 
course, but enough male rabbits act that way to make it a valid one. 
Bucks also have the unpleasant habit of marking their territory, spraying 
urine around the house on vertical surfaces.
 
✓ Does (females): Often said to be territorial and aloof, females care about 
reproducing to the point that they even conjure up false pregnancies if 
they aren’t bred. Much like the buck, some female rabbits spray urine to 
mark their area.
 
Face it — neither one of these options sounds particularly appealing. In fact, 
if you read them again, you may start to wonder why anyone would ever want 
to keep either gender for a pet. It seems that raging hormones are the problem 
for both genders and are a large part of the reason that rabbits are so well 
known for reproductive tendencies. Luckily for those who love to share their 
lives with rabbits, a solution exists. Simply have your buck neutered or your 
doe spayed (see Chapter 9), and you’re relieved of many of these behavioral 
problems. In fact, the sooner you spay or neuter your rabbit, the more likely 
your pet will never develop any of the unpleasant behaviors discussed here 
and in Chapter 13.
Opting for an Only Rabbit or a Bunny 
with a Built-in Companion
More than one bunny means all the more fun, right? Sure it does, but it also 
means more work and a bit of planning and thought, too, for several reasons:
 
✓ Most rabbits love other rabbits. Rabbits are social creatures and love 
the companionship of their own species. If the time that you have to 
spend with your rabbit is limited, providing a home to at least two bun-
nies can ward off loneliness for both pets.
 
✓ Some rabbits don’t like other rabbits. Although rabbits are social crea-
tures and enjoy the company of other rabbits, like people, each has its 
own personality as well as likes and dislikes. In other words, not all 

29
 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
rabbits get along well together. Putting strange rabbits together, 
whether intact or not, is serious business and should be done with great 
care. Some rabbits never get along.
 
 Unless two rabbits grow up together, they’re likely to fight or at least be 
disagreeable toward each other in the beginning. Introductions need to 
be made slowly and carefully to ensure that the rabbits don’t get into a 
literal bunny free-for-all. Putting several rabbits together requires a large 
space. See Chapters 5 and 6 for more details on housing your rabbits.
 
 In fact, rabbit fights can be downright dangerous, and rabbits have been 
known to seriously injure and sometimes kill each other. Keeping sib-
lings together is the best bet for rabbit harmony, as long as both pets 
are spayed or neutered.
 
✓ Two rabbits mean double work. When it comes time to clean up after 
your rabbits, two rabbits are twice as much work as one. You have 
much more to do when you have two rabbits sharing a hutch or two 
rabbits in their own cages. Also, you need to feed two rabbits, provide 
water to two rabbits, and give exercise and vet care to two rabbits. All 
these extra chores are more time-consuming and costly.
 
✓ If you want a rabbit for a companion, stick with only one rabbit. 
Rabbits who spend more time with other rabbits than humans tend to 
have a stronger bond with members of their own species rather than 
their human caretakers. If you want your rabbit to be more focused on 
you rather than a rabbit companion, have only one rabbit and spend a 
considerable amount of time with your pet.
 
✓ Littermates do well together. However, if they’re male and female, as 
soon as they’re of age (4 months), littermates do what rabbits do — 
incestuous or not.
If you plan to have more than one rabbit, introducing the bunnies carefully to 
avoid a fight is important. Rabbits are territorial, and it may take some con-
vincing to get your resident bunny to accept a newcomer. Also, because rab-
bits have strong hierarchies in their social groups, your rabbits will probably 
scramble to see who is going to be the boss (see Chapter 11).
 
The first step toward a successful friendship between rabbits is spaying and 
neutering. Raging hormones can cause rabbits to fight when they might other-
wise get along. Altering your rabbits means getting rid of those pesky 
hormones, resulting in a calmer and more docile bunny.
When deciding whether two rabbits can become friends, keep in mind that 
sex can be an important factor, too. Spayed females tend to get along best 
with neutered males. If you end up with two of the same sex, some rabbit folk 
report that two females are a better match than two males, who can be more 
territorial. Of course, like anything with rabbits, much of this dynamic has to 
do with individual personalities.

30
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
When making the initial rabbit-to-rabbit introduction, follow these guidelines:
 
1. Make the introduction on neutral territory.
 
 Pick a spot where neither rabbit has had a chance to stake a claim, such 
as a room in the house where neither has ever been. Placing the rabbits 
on unclaimed turf will temper their instinctive urge to defend territory.
 
2. Keep the rabbits in individual cages at first and put the cages next to 
each other so that they can see one another.
 
 Leave them together in this arrangement as often as possible.
 
3. After the rabbits seem comfortable with each other through their cages, 
place them together in the neutral territory while they’re wearing 
leashes and harnesses.
 
 Make sure your rabbits have plenty of hiding places to allow escape 
should it be necessary. Let them spend time together (as much as you 
can) but don’t allow them to get too close to each other.
 
4. Look for signs of trouble.
 
 Be aware of the signs that a rabbit is ready to attack: Ears will be bent 
back at a 45 degree angle, and the rabbit’s tail will be raised. Rabbits that 
are biting or screaming during a scuffle should be separately immediately.
 
5. When the rabbits seem comfortable together and you don’t detect any 
aggression, allow them to get a little closer while still on their leashes.
 
 If they do start to fight, you can separate them more easily because 
they’re leashed.
 
6. If you don’t see any signs of hostility, you can let the rabbits loose 
together in the neutral space.
 
 If they do squabble, break it up by squirting a water gun or spray bottle 
at them. Provided that you’re dealing with neutered rabbits, the two 
can eventually work things out between them. If they do fight in the 
beginning, their personalities may be such that they never become best 
friends, but they at least need to tolerate each other.
After considering these factors, you may opt to just keep one rabbit for now. 
You can always add another bunny to your household later on. Or you may 
find that one rabbit is just right for your family and your situation. Again, if 
you’re sure that you want to add more than one rabbit to your household, 
study up on the best way to make the transition for successful results. For 
more on how on how rabbits relate to each other and to help your bunny get 
along with your other pets, see Chapter 11.

 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
Mixing it Up: Bunny Mutts
A mixed breed is just that — a mix of different breeds that results in a unique, 
maybe surprising, kind of rabbit. If you’re simply looking for a companion 
rabbit and have no notions of breeding or showing (see Chapters 10 and 15, 
respectively, for more on these topics), a mixed-breed rabbit is a wonderful 
choice. In fact, you’re more likely to find a mixed breed in need of a home at 
animal shelters or rabbit rescue groups than a purebred.
 
Here are some good reasons to bring home a mixed-breed rabbit:
 
✓ If you go to a shelter or rescue group to adopt a rabbit, you’ll be providing 
a home to a bunny who desperately needs one. This feeling is great!
 
✓ Rabbits within a breed tend to all look alike to the untrained eye, but 
mixed-breed rabbits are truly unique. No two are exactly alike.
If you choose to adopt a rabbit from a rescue group or animal shelter (a ter-
rific idea that’s covered in Chapter 4), you’re likely to end up with a rabbit of 
unknown parentage. However, if you study photographs and descriptions of 
each rabbit breed in Chapter 3, you can use your detective skills and prob-
ably see purebred elements in your mixed-breed rabbit. Known in the rabbit 
world as scrubs, rabbits who are obviously not purebreds to a trained eye are 
assumed to be a mixture of breeds.
 
Of course, you don’t need to know your mixed breed’s ancestry to love her, 
but it may come in handy when dealing with issues such as coat care, ear 
care, and size. Mixed-breed rabbits come in a variety of shapes and sizes as 
a result of their varied bloodlines. If you want to adopt a mixed-breed bunny, 
you should think about its coat type, ear type, head shape, and its size.
Rabbit coat types
Generally speaking, rabbits come in two different coat types: longhair and 
shorthair, both of which are shown in Figure 2-1.
Longhair rabbits need frequent grooming. If your rabbit seems to have fur 
that looks similar to an Angora’s coat (see Chapter 3 for more information 
on what that looks like), your bunny probably has some Angora breeding 
and should be treated like an Angora when it comes to grooming. Brush a 
longhair rabbit to keep the hair from matting, which can lead to skin disease. 
In the case of matting around the anal area, brush out the hair to avoid the 
accumulation of stool and urine that can burn the skin.
Shorthair rabbits, on the other hand, do need grooming but not as often as a 
longhair rabbit.

32

Figure 2-1: 
Longhairs

Shorthair? 
To the right.
 
Head shape
The breeds that have shortened faces or small heads have a higher incidence 
of dental disease caused by malocclusion (the upper and lower teeth aren’t 
properly aligned). Rabbit teeth grow throughout their lifetime, and they 
must wear properly on each other in order to stay in alignment. Therefore, in 
rabbit breeds such as the lop-eared, which has a flatter face, and the dwarf, 
which has a smaller head, pay particular attention to the appearance of the 
teeth when looking for a pet.
Some dental disease won’t show up until the rabbit is 4 months old. It’s there-
fore important to have your rabbit checked by an experienced veterinarian 
within its first year of life.
Myth of the hairballs
Contrary to popular myth, hair is normally in a 
rabbit’s stomach because rabbits are constantly 
grooming themselves. In a normal rabbit, this 
hair leaves the stomach and moves on through, 
ending up in the litter box. The malady tradition-
ally called hairballs is really a dehydrated mass 
of hair and food that doesn’t want to move. This 
condition can be caused by any illness that 
results in dehydration, but is more common in 
rabbits eating a diet that is low in certain types 
of fiber. The hair in itself is not the problem, but 
the diet is, and the situation demands immediate 
attention. For more on rabbit diet, see Chapter 7; 
Chapter 9 discusses gastrointestinal issues in 
detail.

 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
Size
Just like with purebred bunnies, you’re likely to see a wide range of sizes 
in mixed-breed rabbits. Mixed breeds can range from 4 to 12 pounds. Most 
mixed-breed bunnies fall somewhere in between:
 
✓ Small is 2–6 pounds.
 
✓ Medium is 6–9 pounds.
 
✓ Large is 9–11 pounds.
 
✓ Giants are over 11 pounds.
 
Size is an important consideration because the larger the rabbit, the more 
space the pet needs. On the other hand, the smaller the rabbit, the harder 
the rabbit is to handle because small rabbits tend to be flighty and nervous. 
Although the 2-pound Dwarfs (see Figure 2-2) are a problem to handle, rabbits 
that are 4 to 5 pounds are a better choice for children.
 
Young children shouldn’t be permitted to lift and carry any rabbit because of 
possible injury to the bunny. (See Chapter 8 for more on lifting and carrying 
rabbits.) A smaller rabbit is particularly vulnerable — not necessarily just due 
to its size but because of its temperament. Conversely, older children who are 
gentle, responsible, and carefully monitored should be able to lift and carry 
both medium-size and smaller bunnies without a problem.

Living the High Life: Bunny Bluebloods
In the last hundred years or so, rabbit fanciers around the world have worked 
hard to create the various breeds of rabbits that exist today. But not all breeds 
are easily available in North America and in many other parts of the world.
If you lean toward a purebred, you have many rabbits to select from. The 
American Rabbit Breeders Association, Inc. (ARBA) recognizes 47 rabbit breeds 
(purebred rabbits other than the 47 ARBA breeds are out there, too), and if you 
want a purebred rabbit, you’ll most likely be choosing from one of these fascinat-
ing types. However, you’ll be happy to know that even though so many rabbit 
breeds exist, each one is distinctive enough in appearance to make your decision 
easier. (The breed descriptions are outlined in Chapter 3.) Size, coat type, and 
color — even personality — can differ significantly between rabbit breeds.
 
Don’t forget that you have all the various mixed-breed rabbits to pick from as 
well, with characteristics of the breeds, but each different from the other.
Purebred reasoning
Before you decide on a mixed-breed or purebred rabbit, give the following 
issues some consideration:
 
✓ Appearance: If you prefer a rabbit with a particular type of fur or general 
appearance, you can get exactly what you want if you go for a purebred. 
Also, keep the coat type in mind. Different rabbit breeds have different 
coat types. English Angoras and Jersey Woolies, for example, are known 
for their profuse coats. These coats are beautiful to look at but require 
considerable time and care to keep groomed. Shorthair breeds, such as 
the Rex and Dutch, on the other hand, need little grooming. Think long 
and hard about whether you have enough time and interest for a 
longhair rabbit.
 
✓ Breeding: If you’ve done your research and are certain you want to get 
involved with rabbit breeding, you should get a purebred. Please keep 
in mind that the world has many bunnies out there in need of homes, 
so breeding rabbits for a hobby without the purpose of improving the 
breed is irresponsible. Responsible rabbit breeders are involved in the 
business of purebred rabbits, understand the ins and outs of rabbit 
husbandry, and have good homes lined up for the rabbits before they 
breed.
 
✓ Disposition: Many breeds of rabbits have distinct dispositions that are 
unique to them. If you want a quieter rabbit, opt for one of the larger 
breeds, which are known for their more gentle temperament (see 
Table 2-1). If you prefer a challenge, go for a smaller, feistier breed. (Of 
course, all rabbits are individuals, and temperament can vary 
even within a particular breed.)

35
 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
 
✓ Showing: If you plan to show your rabbit in the American ARBA shows, 
you must have a purebred. (For more on the ARBA, check out the 
resources in the Appendix.) If your child wants to show rabbits in 4-H, a 
purebred offers more opportunities for showing than a mixed breed. See 
Chapter 15 for more showing details.
 
✓ Size: With a purebred rabbit, you know exactly what size the bunny will 
be when he’s grown; Table 2-1 has the breakdown. For example, if you 
buy a young purebred New Zealand rabbit, you know that it will grow 
up to weigh about 10 pounds, max, because that’s typical of the New 
Zealand breed. Purebred rabbits come in an assortment of sizes, from 
the tiny 2-pound Netherland Dwarf to the huge 14-pound Flemish Giant 
and a number of sizes in between. The smaller breeds are easier to house 
than the larger breeds. The large breeds require bigger cages and bigger 
biceps to lift. The majority of breed sizes is in between, which is the 
typical size that most people think of when they imagine a pet rabbit.

Different breeds, different looks
 
Rabbits come in a vast array of colors and patterns according to ARBA. The 
group declares that a few coat variations exist within the breeds, too. “What’s 
the difference?” you ask. Well, I’ll tell you:
 
✓ Coat: The kind of fur a rabbit has. Rabbits come in one of four different 
kinds of fur, the first three of which are considered shorthair:
 
• Normal rabbit fur is the kind of coat that you see on most rabbits. 
It comes in two layers: an overcoat and undercoat. Both layers are 
about an inch in length. The undercoat is soft and serves as 
insulation to keep the rabbit warm.
 
• Rex fur is found only on Rex rabbits and breeds with Rex lineage. 
This fur looks and feels like velvet and is shorter than normal fur. 
Cottony and airy to the touch, Rex fur stands upright instead of 
laying flat against the rabbit’s body.
 
• Satin fur has a silky, shiny appearance, the result of its fine, some-
what translucent hair shafts. Satin coats are about the same length 
as normal fur coats but can be distinguished by their distinctive 
luster.
 
• Angora coat is long (2 to 3 inches in length) and fluffy and is often 
used for spinning because of its warmth. Because it’s used to make 
clothing, the Angora coat is often referred to as wool. The fur stands 
away from the rabbit’s body, giving it a fuzzy, puffy appearance.
 
✓ Color: Rabbit colors are arranged in pattern groups. Individual colors 
exist within each pattern group. (Some have the same name as the pat-
tern group, but are considered distinct colorations and not just pattern 
You pure about that?
You may be wondering what exactly makes a 
rabbit purebred. A purebred rabbit or animal of 
any kind is a member of breed — a group of 
individuals within a domesticated species that 
has common ancestors and characteristics 
that are different from other groups of individu-
als within the same species. Rabbit breeds are 
similar to dog breeds, such as Cocker Spaniel 
and Collie, in that respect. Both dog breeds 
and rabbits breeds have distinct body types, 
head shapes, colorations, and other traits that 
when combined result in a unique kind of dog 
or rabbit.

37
 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
groups.) Each breed has its own breed standard and allowed color variet-
ies, but a host of common colors can be found in many different breeds.
 
✓ Patterns are made of the following:
 
• Agouti: Agouti-colored rabbits have three or more bands of color 
on each guard hair shaft, usually with a dark gray base. (Guard hair 
is the coarse, outer hair on most mammals.) Two or more alternat-
ing light or dark rings are also present. The head, feet, and ears of 
a rabbit of this color are usually ticked (darker), while the circles 
around the eyes, the fur on the belly, and the fur under the jaws 
tend to be lighter. Agouti-colored rabbits come in chestnut, choco-
late, sable, lilac, and smoke pearl.
 
• Brindle: Brindle, a color also seen commonly in certain dog 
breeds, such as the Greyhound and American Pit Bull Terrier, is 
an intermingling of two solid guard hair colors, a dark and a light. 
Black and orange as well as black and white are the prevalent color 
combinations. The brindle pattern appears consistently through-
out the body.
 
• Broken: Two different subdivisions can be found within the broken 
pattern: bicolor and tricolor. A bicolored broken pattern consists 
of any normal rabbit color appearing with white. For example, 
a bicolored rabbit may be white with black spots. A tricolored 
rabbit, on the other hand, has white along with two other colors.
 
• Marked: Rabbits of marked patterns are usually white with pat-
terns consisting of another color throughout their bodies.
 
• Pointed white: Much like a Siamese cat, this type of rabbit is all 
white with a darker color on its nose, ears, feet, and tail.
 
• Self: Used to describe solid-color rabbits, this term applies to 
those bunnies who have a uniform color throughout their entire 
body.
 
• Shaded: Shaded rabbits show a gradual shift in color, beginning 
with a darker color on their backs, heads, necks, ears, legs, and 
tails. This color eventually turns into a lighter version of the same 
color when it reaches the rabbit’s sides.
 
• Solid: Similar to the self-pattern, described earlier in this list, this 
pattern may also include agouti and other mixed-color fur, as long 
as colors don’t create a pattern or marking.
 
• Ticked: Contrasting the rabbit’s main color, solid or tipped guard 
hairs throughout the coat distinguish this pattern.
 
• Wide band: Rabbits of this coloration have the same color on their 
bodies, heads, ears, tails, and feet. Their eye circles, underside of 
tail, jaws, and belly have a lighter coloration.

38
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
 
✓ Common colors: In addition to black and white, the colors in the 
following list are those you’ll see most often:
 
• Beige: Rabbits of this color have a beige pigment throughout their 
bodies except for the napes of their necks, which is lighter. They 
have a bluish-white color on their bellies, along with eye circles 
(coloration around the outside of the eye) of the same color. Their 
eyes are brown with a ruby glow.
 
• Blue: The blue coloration in rabbits is best described as a medium 
shade of gray with a blue or lavender cast. The eyes of a blue-
colored rabbit are blue-gray.
 
• Castor: A rich dark chestnut color, castor has also been described 
as mahogany brown. Castor fur is lightly tipped with black evenly 
distributed over the body, head, and legs. The belly of a castor 
rabbit is white or tan, and the eyes are brown.
 
• Chinchilla: Chinchilla-colored rabbits possess a blend of black and 
pearl hairs with a dark gray base. Named after the coloring seen on 
actual chinchillas, a rodent known for its lush fur, chinchilla 
rabbits also come in a chocolate version.
 
• Chocolate: A deep dark brown, the chocolate coloration features 
a light gray undercoat. The eyes are brown with a red cast in sub-
dued light.
 
• Fawn: Fawn-colored rabbits are a deep golden color over their 
backs onto their flanks and chests. Their eye circles, insides of 
ears, under jaws, tails, and bellies are white. Fawn-colored rabbits 
have gray or brown eyes.
 
• Lilac: This coloration features a medium-gray hue with a pinkish 
tint over the rabbit’s entire body. The eyes are the same color as 
the fur and have a ruby glow in subdued light.
 
• Lynx: The body and the top of the lynx-colored rabbit’s tail are 
tinged with lilac and light orange with a sharper orange color 
showing through. Areas underneath the tail, belly, and jaw are 
white. The eye circles and insides of the ears are also white. The 
eyes of a lynx-colored rabbit are blue-gray.
 
• Opal: Opal-colored rabbits feature a pale bluish color on the top of 
the hair shaft with a fawn band below it and a dark gray undercoat. 
The ears of the opal are laced with blue. The eye circles and under-
side of the rabbit are white with a dark gray undercoat. The eyes 
are gray.
 
• Siamese: Not surprisingly, Siamese-colored rabbits look much like 
seal-point Siamese cats. They have dark brown color on their ears, 
head, feet, belly, and tail with a lighter body color so that the dark 
points can be seen. The eyes are brown.

39
 Chapter 2: Choosing the “Right” Rabbit
 
• Squirrel: Although it’s a strange color name for a rabbit, squirrel is 
often used nonetheless. The hair shaft of rabbits with the squirrel 
coloration consists of a blend of gray and white bands. This color 
extends from the rabbit’s back down to its sides, where it’s met by 
white on the belly and top of the hind feet. The nape of the neck, 
chest, and eye circles are a lighter version of the original color. 
The upper part of the ears has a dark blue edge. The eyes are gray.
 
• Steel: This interesting color pattern comes in black, blue, choco-
late, lilac, sable, and smoke pearl. The entire body of the rabbit 
features one of these colors, the hairs of which are diffused with a 
small amount of gold or silver tipping, depending on whether the 
rabbit is a gold steel or a silver steel. The eyes are brown or gray.
 
• Tan Pattern: Different from beige, the tan coloration features a 
solid color on the head, back, sides, outside of ears, back legs, 
front of forelegs, and top of the tail. A lighter color appears on the 
eye circles, nostrils, jaw, chest, and underside of the rabbit’s body.
 
• Tortoiseshell: Rabbits with this coloration don’t have a shell that 
they can duck into, but they sport a lively orange on their bodies, 
which mingles into a grayish-blue shadowing over the rump and 
haunches. The top of the tail matches the orange color, but under-
neath is the color of the shadowing. Tortoiseshell-colored rabbits 
have brown eyes.
 
Even though it may seem hard to visualize the patterns and colors listed in 
descriptions of these breeds, they can be broken down into more simple 
terms. Start with the various types of coats that rabbits have and then move 
on to the different colorations and patterns.

In This Chapter
▶ Listing the rabbit breeds
▶ Discovering the differences between the breeds
I
f you’re thinking that a purebred rabbit may be the right choice for you, 
you’ve taken your first step toward finding your pet. Your next step is to 
consider the nearly 50 breeds recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders 
Association, Inc. (ARBA), which governs the business of purebred rabbits in 
the United States. (See Chapter 15 for more ARBA information.)
Each breed has a unique appearance, with differences in size, coat type, and 
color. Even a rabbit’s personality can vary according to breed. So, you ask, 
how are you ever going to sort through it all? Well, go to the experts. All the 
ARBA rabbit breeds have a unique history and a set of fans who believe their 
breed of rabbit is the absolute best. You’ll find many of these experts in breed 
clubs, groups of people who specialize in each of the ARBA breeds.
Take a look at these breeds and judge for yourself. Then see the Appendix of 
this book for ARBA contact information and the recognized breed clubs.
American
Compact in appearance, the American is a medium-size rabbit, weighing 
around 10 pounds. Its mandolin-shaped body provides a slight arch over the 
loins and hindquarters and a taper from the hindquarters to the shoulders. In 
existence nearly 100 years, the American breed comes in two color varieties: 
blue or white. The blue variety has blue-gray eyes, and the white version has 
pink eyes.

42
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
American Fuzzy Lop
The Fuzzy Lop, which is related to the Holland Lop and the Angora, is avail-
able in many colors. This color choice, along with its furry coat and long, 
floppy ears, make it a popular breed with rabbit lovers. The American Fuzzy 
Lop is shown in six different groups based on its color pattern: broken, 
pointed white, wide band, agouti, shaded, and self. Within those groups are 
the agouti colors of chestnut, chinchilla, opal, and lynx. The broken colors 
of any recognized rabbit breed are allowed, as are the solid colors of black, 
white, lilac, blue, and chocolate. A number of other color patterns are also 
available in this small rabbit, whose body is short and stocky. This cobby 
(stocky) little rabbit’s coat is long and woolly, requiring frequent grooming.
American Sable
The ears, face, legs, and tail of the American Sable are darker than the main 
part of its body. This rabbit is well named because its coat is a beautiful dark 
brown — the result of crosses with the Chinchilla. A medium-size rabbit 
sporting a slightly arched back, the American Sable is an attractive pet, 
weighing around 9 pounds.
Angora
Angora rabbits come in one of four types:
 
✓ English Angora: Originating in Turkey, the English Angora breed is at 
least 200 years old, if not older. This rabbit comes in six color groups: 
the pointed white, self, agouti, shaded, wide band, and ticked. Within 
these groups, the colors available are white with black; blue lilac or 
chocolate points; solid blue, black, chestnut, agouti, chinchilla, choco-
late agouti, chocolate chinchilla, copper, lilac, lilac chinchilla, lynx, 
squirrel, opal and wild gray; shaded blue cream, chocolate tortoiseshell, 
dark sable, frosted pearl, lilac cream, smoke pearl, sable and tortoise-
shell; solid cream, red and fawn; and ticked chocolate steel, lilac steel, 
steel and blue steel. Compact in size and stature, the English Angora 
weighs in at around 6 pounds.
 
✓ French Angora: The French Angora was developed before the English 
Angora, specifically for its wool. The French people used to hand pluck 
its wool and spin it for clothing. This breed comes in the same four-color 
varieties as the English Angora and in the identical colors. While the 

43
 Chapter 3: So Many Breeds, So Little Time
two breeds are similar, the French Angora is somewhat bigger than the 
English, weighing in at around 9 pounds. The French Angora also has 
less hair on its head, ears, and legs.
 
✓ Giant Angora: Bathed in fur, the Giant Angora, with its dramatic appear-
ance, tends to stand out among the rest of the Angora breeds. Unlike 
the other Angoras, the Giant is available only in white, with blue eyes or 
ruby eyes. It’s larger than the English or the Satin, weighing in at around 
9 pounds. Its coat is similar to the English Angora in that it has longer 
furnishings (hair on its ears, face, and legs).
 
✓ Satin Angora: Slightly smaller than the English Angora, Satin Angoras 
usually weigh around 7 pounds. The Satin Angora comes in the same 
color varieties as the English and French Angoras. The main difference 
between the Satin and the other Angoras is its coat. The Satin, as its 
name would imply, has shinier, silkier hair than its counterparts.
Each one of these Angoras is a separate breed and has the characteristic 
long, woolly hair typical of this rabbit family. Angoras come in a vast array of 
beautiful colors and come in two color classifications: white and colored.
 
Because of the Angora’s dense coat, which measures about 3 inches in length, 
this breed needs plenty of grooming. You should only consider owning an 
Angora if you have the time and patience to spend brushing its luxurious coat. 
Chapter 8 offers grooming information.
Belgian Hare
Europeans developed the Belgian Hare in the late 1800s specifically for the 
lean, racehorselike appearance. Despite its name, the Belgian Hare isn’t really 
a hare but is actually a domestic rabbit. However, its long legs and ears give 
it the appearance of a hare, hence its name. Only available in red chestnut, 
the Belgian Hare is a large-size rabbit of about 9 pounds.
Beveren
A large rabbit of about 10 pounds, the Beveren has a thick, silky coat. It’s of 
medium length and has a slightly arched back. Not as frequently seen in the 
United States as some other breeds, the Beveren was developed in Europe 
and comes in the color varieties of white, blue, and black.

44
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Britannia Petite
Known for being curious and alert, the tiny, fine-boned Britannia Petite can 
make a good pet for older children who can treat this light-stature breed 
gently. This rabbit is all white or black otter-colored and weighs only about 2 
pounds.
Californian
Originally bred in the Golden State in the 1920s, the Californian is related 
to the Himalayan, which is similar in appearance. This popular rabbit looks 
much like a Siamese cat, with its white coat and black-tipped ears, nose, 
feet, and tail. Somewhat large in size, the typical Californian weighs about 9 
pounds. Its body is plump and firm to the touch.
Champagne d’ Argent
The Argent, an old breed, was originally bred in the Champagne province 
of France for its fur and meat. Weighing about 10 pounds, the medium-size 
Argent is a popular pet in the United States. The Argent coat contains a 
marvelous mix of colored hairs that has a silvery effect.
Checkered Giant
The Checkered Giant was first brought to America from Europe in 1910 and 
sports a long, well-arched body. This popular breed comes in black and blue 
color varieties. The breed is typically white with dark markings, including 
a “butterfly” on the nose, dark ears, dark circles around the eyes, spots on 
the cheeks, and various other dark patches on the body. Weighing a solid 11 
pounds or more, the Checkered Giant is related to the Flemish Giant.
Chinchilla
The Chinchilla comes in three breeds: the Standard, the American, and the 
Giant. All three types have the coloring of an actual chinchilla and are popu-
lar pets because of their attractive coats.

45
 Chapter 3: So Many Breeds, So Little Time
 
✓ Standard Chinchilla is the foundation of the Chinchilla breed, weighing 
around 6 pounds. Reportedly developed in France by crossing a wild gray 
rabbit with some domestic strains, the breed was first shown in 1913. It 
has a medium body with a slight arch to the back.
 
✓ American Chinchilla is the middleweight of the three Chinchilla breeds, 
coming in at around 10 pounds. It was bred down from the Standard 
variety for its size.
 
✓ Giant Chinchilla is the largest in this family and the result of a cross 
between the Flemish Giant and a smaller Chinchilla by an American 
breeder sometime after World War I. It was developed as a meat rabbit, 
but makes a nice, albeit large, pet at about 14 pounds.
Cinnamon
This breed comes only in a reddish color synonymous with its name. The 
ears, face, and feet bear a darker shade of this same color. Occasional 
shades of gray on various parts of its body contribute to this breed’s unusual 
appearance. Cinnamons, which are related to the New Zealand White, the 
Checkered Giant, the Californian, and the Chinchilla, weigh approximately 10 
pounds.
Crème d’ Argent
The Crème d’Argent, which originated in France, is a handsome rabbit with 
an exquisitely colored coat of pale orange. Lighter guard hairs give this rabbit 
a smooth and silky appearance. Typically, the Crème d’Argent weighs about 9 
pounds.
Dutch
Originally from Holland, the Dutch is one of the oldest established rabbit 
breeds. Small and compact, these rabbits weigh around 4 pounds. The Dutch 
is an extremely popular rabbit and easily recognizable because of its mark-
ings; they have a band of white around the chest. Available in six color variet-
ies, the Dutch has a dark head with a white nose, a white blaze (a white stripe 
starting at the nose and going upward toward the face), and dark britches 
(the back half of the rabbit). Its dark eyes blend into the color on its face, 
which can be black, blue, chocolate, tortoiseshell, steel, or gray.

46
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Dwarf Hotot
Only seen in white with dark eyes, the Dwarf Hotot weighs about 3 pounds 
and was bred down from the Hotot in the 1970s. At first sight, the tiny Dwarf 
Hotot appears to be wearing eyeliner. The breed’s characteristic black eye 
bands give it this look.
English Spot
An old breed whose popularity began in England in the late 1800s, the English 
Spot is still a favorite breed and makes a good pet. The English, for short, 
is reminiscent of a Dalmatian with its white coat and dark spots. The breed 
comes in seven different color varieties of which the breed’s markings are 
made: black, blue, chocolate, gold, gray, lilac, and tortoiseshell. A capped 
nose, dark ears, eye rings, and a stripe along the back are all characteristic of 
this breed, which weighs about 8 pounds.
Flemish Giant
Seen quite often at rabbit shows, the Flemish Giant originated in Belgium as 
its name suggests. Massive in size, the Flemish Giant is the largest breed of 
rabbit and weighs over 14 pounds. Available in steel gray, light gray, black, 
blue, white, sandy, and fawn, this breed is popular as a pet because of its 
large size.
 
In general, the larger the rabbit, the greater the tendency to be more laid-back 
and relaxed than the dwarf breeds.
Florida White
This breed — a cross between the Dutch, Polish, and New Zealand White — 
is relatively new; the American Rabbit Breeders Association accepted this 
breed in the early 1960s. Sadly, the Florida White is one of the breeds com-
monly used for laboratory research. This breed comes in white only, as its 
name implies, with pink eyes. It weighs about 5 pounds.

47
 Chapter 3: So Many Breeds, So Little Time
Harlequin
The Harlequin, developed in France in the 1800s, is an interesting, medium-
size rabbit of about 8 pounds with unusual markings. Available in two color 
groups and four actual colors, the Harlequin is best described as having an 
“ice-cream sundae” look to its coat. Different colors swirl and blend in unique 
configurations. The heads of Harlequin rabbits are split in half by color, 
making them look like a different rabbit from one side to the next! Harlequin 
base colors are black, blue, lilac, and chocolate and come in two types:
 
✓ Japanese Harlequin sports a coat that has a base coloring that inter-
changes with strips of orange or a lighter version of the base color.
 
✓ Magpie Harlequin base coloring alternates with strips of white.
Havana
The small, shiny Havana was created from a single rabbit born to an unpedi-
greed doe in Holland in 1898. First appearing in chocolate, the Havana is now 
available in blue and black varieties as well. Prized for its coat, the Havana 
is short and stocky (close coupled). Its weight of 6 pounds and its compact 
build can make it a nice pet for an older child.
Himalayan
More widely distributed around the world than any other breed of rabbit, 
the Himalayan is popular in China and Russia, as well as in the United States. 
The breed has been around for many years, reportedly originating near the 
Himalayan Mountains. Distinctive because of its white coat and blue or black 
markings, this small-size rabbit weighs only about 4 pounds.
Hotot
The breed was first imported into the United States in the late 1970s. In 
France, this breed is known as the Blanc de Hotot, which means the white of 
Hotot. Hotot is the area where the breed was developed. Available only in a 
frosty white color with thin black eye circles, the medium-size Hotot weighs 
around 9 pounds.

48
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Jersey Wooly
A recently developed breed of rabbit created in the 1970s through crossbreed-
ing, the Jersey Wooly was created specifically for its luxurious coat. The fur of 
the Jersey Wooly is available in agouti (chestnut, chinchilla, opal, and squirrel), 
pointed white (black or blue markings), self (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, blue-
eyed white, and ruby-eyed white), shaded (sable point, seal, Siamese sable, 
smoke pearl, tortoiseshell, and blue tortoiseshell), and tan pattern (black otter, 
blue otter, silver marten, sable marten, and smoke pearl marten) color groups. 
A small rabbit, the Jersey Wooly weighs about 3 pounds.
 
This breed is known for its gentle temperament and for being an exceptional 
pet. However, because of its long coat, the Jersey Wooly does require regular 
grooming.
Lilac
The Lilac comes in one color: a light pinkish gray. Originally considered a devi-
ation from the norm, the Lilac began as a result of an unusual coloration within 
the Havana breed. Weighing about 7 pounds, the body of the Lilac is substan-
tial and compact. This breed makes a good and attractive companion rabbit.
Lop
The Lop rabbits are probably the most distinctive and easily recognizable 
of all the breeds. The Lop has huge ears that flop down beside its head like 
a hound dog’s ears, giving it a special look unique to the breed. Along with 
those big ears comes a wonderful personality. Because Lops are bred specifi-
cally for show and pet purposes, they tend to be people oriented. Owners of 
Lops report that they’re amusing rabbits to live with and can also grow to be 
affectionate and sensitive to their owners’ feelings.
Lops come in four different breeds, each unique in both its appearance 
and history:
 
✓ English Lop: Developed at least as early as the 1800s, the English Lop is 
one of the oldest breeds of domestic rabbit still in existence and the first of 
the lop-eared breeds. The ears of an adult English Lop measure 25 inches 
or more in length. Weighing approximately 10 pounds, the English Lop 
comes in broken and solid color patterns. Within those patterns, many 
of the typical rabbit colors are found. When being judged at rabbit shows, 
the ears are the most important aspect of this well-balanced breed.

 Chapter 3: So Many Breeds, So Little Time
 
✓ French Lop: Developed in France in the 1800s from the English Lop 
and the Flemish Giant, the French Lop differs from the English in that it 
sports a heavier stature and shorter ears. The French Lop weighs in at 
around 10 pounds and comes in two color varieties: solid and broken. 
This breed comes in many different rabbit colors. The French Lop is a 
close relative of the English Lop, which was used in its creation.
 
✓ Holland Lop: Also known as the Netherland Dwarf Lop, the tiny, com-
pact Holland Lop weighs only about 4 pounds. The Holland Lop is a 
dwarf breed of Lop, created in Holland in the 1960s. It falls into the same 
color varieties as the French and English: agouti, broken, pointed white, 
self, solid, shaded, and ticked. Holland Lops are available in any recog-
nized rabbit color.
 
✓ Mini Lop: Developed in the 1970s in Germany, the Mini Lop was origi-
nally called the Klein Widder until its named was changed in the 1980s, 
when the American Rabbit Breeders Association recognized it.
 
 The Mini Lop, shown in Figure 3-1, is similar to the French Lop, although 
it’s much smaller at around 5 pounds. The breed comes in the usual Lop 
color varieties of agouti, broken, pointed white, shelf, shaded, solid, and 
ticked. All recognized rabbit colors are seen in the Mini Lop.

Mini Rex
The Mini Rex breed, shown in Figure 3-2, is growing in popularity as a pet 
and show rabbit because of its luxurious fur, which is short yet plush, and its 
small size. Cottony and airy to the touch, Rex fur looks and feels like velvet 
and is shorter than normal fur. Their guard hairs are erect and short and the 
undercoat is erect, which gives it that cut fur look. (Guard hair is the coarse, 
outer hair on most mammals.)
This breed was developed using the standard-size Rex. Weighing about 4 
pounds, the Mini Rex is available in the same color varieties and colors as its 
larger cousin, the Rex.
 
Rabbits with Rex fur lack the heavy protective fur on the foot pad. Rex rabbit 
owners need to take care to keep their pets from becoming overweight and 
house the pets on a surface that provides some softness.

 Chapter 3: So Many Breeds, So Little Time
Mini Satin
Weighing in at about 4 pounds, the Mini Satin is a more petite version of 
the American Satin. An American creation going back to the 1970s, the Mini 
Satin was recognized as a breed in the ARBA standard only in February 2006, 
making it the 47th ARBA breed. Although color varieties can include red, 
broken, and white, only the white variety can compete for Best Mini Satin. 
Like its larger counterpart, Mini Satins are known for their brilliant color, due 
to a recessive trait that results in a more transparent covering of the hair 
shaft.
Netherland Dwarf
 
Part of the Netherland Dwarf’s appeal is no doubt the result of its babylike 
features; fully grown adult Netherland Dwarfs still resemble what’s commonly 
known as kits (baby rabbits) among rabbit lovers. This popular breed is the 
smallest of domestic rabbits, not weighing more than 2 pounds. Its tiny stat-
ure, wide availability of colors, small ears, and large eyes make it a popular 
pet. The Netherland Dwarf comes in the following color varieties and colors: 
self (white with ruby eyes, white with blue eyes, black, blue, chocolate, and 
lilac); shaded (Siamese sable, Siamese smoke pearl, and sable point); agouti 
(chinchilla, lynx, opal, squirrel, and chestnut); tan pattern (sable marten, 
silver marten, smoke pearl marten, otter, and tan); and any other variety 
(fawn, Himalayan, orange, steel, and tortoiseshell).
 
This breed is definitely more prone to dental disease due to the small size of 
their heads and shortened jaws.
New Zealand
Despite its name, the New Zealand was developed in the United States, where 
it was created for meat, fur, and research purposes. In spite of its original 
function, however, the New Zealand has become a popular pet and show 
rabbit. This breed comes in three distinct color varieties: white, black, and 
red. The red was the first color to appear after what experts believe was 
a cross between a Belgium Hare and a white rabbit. Typical New Zealands 
weigh about 10 pounds.

52
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Palomino
The Palomino’s golden color is similar to the coat colors seen in the 
Palomino horse. (Surprise!) A newer breed, the Palomino was developed in 
the United States and comes in two color varieties: golden and lynx. Weighing 
about 9 pounds, the Palomino has a slightly arched back and makes a good 
pet because of its easygoing personality.
Polish
Some experts believe that the name of this breed doesn’t refer to the country 
of Poland but rather to this rabbit’s shiny coat. A tiny bunny weighing only 
about 3 pounds, the Polish is believed to have developed in England in the 
1800s. Commonly seen at rabbit shows, this breed comes in five color variet-
ies: blue, black, chocolate, blue-eyed white, and ruby-eyed white.
Rex
The Rex, which comes in a wide variety of colors, is popular as a pet and show 
rabbit. Rex rabbit fur looks and feels like plush velvet, as shown in Figure 3-3. 
Created in 1919 from a mutation, the Rex’s unusual coat can be attributed to 
erect, short guard hairs and erect, short undercoat. Weighing approximately 
9 pounds, the Rex comes in black, black otter, blue, Californian, castor, chin-
chilla, chocolate, lilac, lynx, opal, red, sable, seal, white, and broken group vari-
eties. All known rabbit colors are seen in the Rex.
Rhinelander
Developed in Europe, the Rhinelander is a medium- to large-size rabbit weigh-
ing anywhere from 7 to 10 pounds. The Rhinelander has an unusual color-
ation that can best be described as patches of calico, much like the coloring 
on the calico cat. The breed’s base color is white, with markings of black and 
orange on its nose, ears, cheeks, eyes, back, and sides.

Satin
Created in the United States from a mutation within the Havana breed, the 
Satin comes in ten different color groups: black, blue, Californian, chinchilla, 
chocolate, copper, red, Siamese, white, and broken. The Satin is so named 
because of its soft, shiny coat. This is a medium-size rabbit with a weight of 
about 9 pounds.
Silver
Believed to have originated in India centuries ago, the Silver breed was 
refined in England during the height of rabbit show popularity. The Silver 
got its name from the silvery sheen on its coat, created by a mixture of white 
hairs against a dark background. Available in black, brown, and fawn, Silvers 
weigh anywhere from 4 to 7 pounds.

54
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Silver Fox
Formerly called the American Heavyweight Silver, the Silver Fox is large, 
weighing about 10 pounds. Originally bred in Europe for its fur, the Silver Fox 
has an unusual coat. Measuring an inch or more in length with a thick under-
coat, the fur of the Silver Fox comes in black or blue varieties.
Silver Marten
Created using the Chinchilla rabbit, the Silver Marten has guard hairs that 
are gray-tipped on a dark background of black, blue, chocolate, or sable. The 
area around the eye and nose are also gray. Silver Martens typically weigh 
about 8 pounds.
Tan
Supposedly the result of an accidental mating between a wild buck and 
a Dutch doe in England during the 1800s, the Tan has been popular 
for decades. The color and markings of this breed are reminiscent of a 
Doberman Pincher, particularly the black and chocolate varieties. The top 
part of the body is dark, but the underside is tan. The tan coloring also 
appears around the eyes and nose, under the neck, and inside the brims of 
the ears. The Tan is a small- to medium-size rabbit, weighing approximately 5 
pounds.
Thrianta
Known to its fans as the “Fire of the Fancy,” the Thrianta is a breed known 
for its unusual orange-red coat. The Thrianta was the 46th breed to be recog-
nized by the ARBA and was approved in February 2006, along with the Mini 
Satin. Thriantas are medium-size rabbits weighing from 4 to 6 pounds, with 
an ideal weight of less than 5 pounds. Although the breed is relatively new 
to the ARBA, its origins go back to the 1930s in Europe. Because all of the 
breed’s original stock in the United States was imported, this newer breed 
may be less widely available than others.

▶ Adopting a rabbit in need

▶ Considering bunnies from breeders
▶ Selecting a healthy rabbit
O
kay, so you can’t wait to get a rabbit. You can’t wait to make that furry 
face and long set of ears a part of your family. But because rabbits 
don’t grow under rocks, you need to go out and find a good source for your 
new companion.
As a potential rabbit owner, you have several options when it comes to finding 
the bunny you’ve decided upon (see Chapter 2). The source you ultimately 
choose depends on exactly what you’re looking for. Before you go, think about 
what you want to do with your rabbit — keep him as a pet or show him — and 
put that scenario together with the information in this chapter.
Donning Your Cape: Rescuing a Rabbit
The true guardian angels of the rabbit world are those who take care of 
unwanted rabbits and struggle to find them good homes. These people are 
found working in animal shelters and within private rabbit rescue groups.
 
Shelters are the very same that take in unwanted dogs and cats and from 
where most municipal animal control agencies work. Rescue groups are pri-
vate, nonprofit organizations mostly run by volunteers. You can look for a 
rescue group in your area in the Appendix, by contacting the House Rabbit 
Society, or by looking on the Internet for a group in your area.

56
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
By adopting a rabbit from a shelter or other organization, you’re not only 
getting a pet, you’re saving a rabbit from a gloomy, uncertain fate. Rabbit 
rescues and shelters are overwhelmed with unwanted bunnies, and, sadly, 
tens of thousands are euthanized each year. In addition, by taking one rabbit 
home, you’re making room for another at a shelter. You’re also spreading the 
good word about the many merits of rabbit adoption.
Presenting the problem
You may be wondering why rabbits would need rescuing. Do that many 
unwanted rabbits exist? If you’re familiar with the pet overpopulation that 
plagues cats and dogs, then you’ll easily understand the situation with rab-
bits. It’s virtually the same dilemma. A lot of domesticated rabbits are alive in 
this country, and not enough of them have homes.
Most of the rabbits that are homeless are in this situation through no fault 
of their own. Common reasons given for abandoning rabbits to shelters and 
rescue groups include
 
✓ The kids (or sadly, the adults) got tired of taking care of the rabbit.
 
✓ I didn’t know that rabbits like to chew on everything (see Chapter 13 for 
training help).
 
✓ We got a baby rabbit for Easter and then it grew up (see Chapter 1).
 
✓ The adolescent rabbit’s behavior is difficult to handle. I don’t want to 
deal with it.
 
✓ My rabbit is urinating or defecating outside his litter box. (Again, see 
Chapter 5 for training help.)
 
✓ My rabbit has chronic health problems, and I no longer have the money 
or time handle them.
Seeking the solution
When unwanted rabbits come to animal shelters or rescue groups, they’re 
put up for adoption.
 
In order to ensure that you’ll provide a good, permanent home for the rabbit 
you’re adopting, be prepared to answer some questions. Each group works a 
bit differently, but some shelters and nearly all rescue groups
 
✓ Screen to make sure that you have the facilities and willingness to 
provide a lasting home for a rabbit. Don’t be offended by their ques-
tions. Remember that these people have the best interests of the rabbit 

57
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
in mind. The last thing anyone wants is for a rabbit to be adopted, only 
to be returned when problems arise.
 
✓ Require that you pay an adoption fee. This is to help offset the cost of 
caring for the rabbit you have adopted. These fees help the groups con-
tinue to operate so they can provide help to rabbits in need.
 
✓ Have only a few rabbits available at any given time in your area. 
You’ll probably be able to choose from only a handful of bunnies, but 
have an open mind and give all the bunnies a chance! It’s worth noting 
that some mixed breeds are hard to place with owners simply because 
of their looks, such as the all-white rabbits with red eyes. (Some people 
think these New Zealand rabbits look “scary”; in fact, they’re known to 
be wonderful companions.)
Shelters
Shelters — whether run by private groups or local governments — do an 
admirable job of finding homes for neglected or abandoned cats, dogs, rab-
bits, and other pets. Not all shelters are created equal, however, and some 
don’t even accept rabbits.
 
✓ At shelters where unadopted pets are euthanized, rabbits are destroyed 
if they’re not adopted within a specified period of time. No-kill shelters 
keep rabbits until they’re adopted (unless, in some cases, there are seri-
ous concerns about health or aggression).
 
✓ In an effort to ensure successful adoptions, some shelters screen poten-
tial adopters. They also factor into adoption fees the cost of spaying 
and neutering, a step that goes a long way toward preventing future 
unwanted litters.
 
✓ Some shelters do not screen adopters or spay or neuter rabbits. 
Although such shelters may charge a nominal fee as low as $1, you’ll 
have to pay to spay or neuter your bunny, which can cost from $75 to 
$350. Other shelters may give you a coupon for a discounted spay or 
neuter.
 
If you make the admirable choice to go to an animal shelter to rescue a bunny, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Call to make sure your local shelter has rabbits on the day you decide 
to go.
 
2. Provide the shelter with honest answers to any questions they ask 
about your family, other pets, schedule, and so on.
 
3. Peruse the rabbits, deciding which one most catches your interest.
 
4. Ask the staff for some information about the rabbit’s personality and 
how the rabbit ended up at the shelter.
 
 You’ll probably get a good sense of who the rabbit is from talking to the 
people who have been caring for the bunny for a period of time.

58
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
 
5. Interact with the bunny yourself.
 
 Keep in mind that an animal shelter full of barking dogs and strange 
smells can be overwhelming to a rabbit, so your interactions with the 
bunny might be rather one-sided.
 
 If possible, ask the staff whether you can take the rabbit to a quiet area 
away from other animals. Sit on the floor and watch his behavior. Unless 
the rabbit is obviously aggressive or is completely terrified, even in a 
quiet environment the bunny will probably make a good pet. (Chapter 
11 tells you more about how to read a rabbit’s body language.)
 
6. Check the rabbit over for signs of ill health to make sure that the 
bunny is in good shape.
 
 For more on what to look for, see the section “Selecting the Rabbit,” 
later in this chapter.
 
 If the rabbit seems sick and you’re interested in adopting him anyway, 
talk to the staff about having the shelter veterinarian treat the rabbit at a 
reduced cost or for no fee if you adopt the animal.
Rescue groups
These private nonprofit organizations usually consist of a network of foster 
homes that provide refuge to unwanted rabbits (many who are about to be 
destroyed by overcrowded and overwhelmed shelters) until permanent homes 
can be found. Individuals within these groups are almost always volunteers 
who provide this service because they love rabbits and want to help them.
An oldie but a goodie
Baby bunnies are unbearably adorable, there’s 
no doubt about that. But as cute as they are, 
these youngsters come with issues that older 
rabbits just don’t have. Baby bunnies
 ✓ Need to be trained. They have to be shown 
how to go in a litter box (a must if you’re 
one of those caring souls who plans to have 
your rabbit hop around the house).
 ✓ Will — sooner than later — become “teen-
ager” bunnies. That means they go through 
a general phase of hormonally driven 
unpleasant behaviors (biting, aggression, 
and territoriality among them).
Another great thing about adult rabbits is that 
they know who they are — and that means 
you know exactly what you’re getting. Adult 
rabbits have already reached their full size, so 
you won’t get any surprises in that department. 
They have also developed their personalities.
Keep in mind, however, that the behavior of 
the adult rabbit you’re considering adopting 
may not change dramatically, particularly if you 
don’t have the time or experience for training. 
Younger rabbits may be more able to train and 
socialize.

59
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
The House Rabbit Society, a nonprofit organization with a network of chap-
ters around the country and the world, leads the way in rabbit advocacy (see 
the sidebar “A Voice for Rabbits”), but other rescue groups out there as well. 
Each group may have its own variations, but a typical adoption from a rescue 
group would go as follows:
 
1. Contact a rescue group.
 
 You can find rescue groups in this book’s Appendix, online, and through 
the House Rabbit Society and local veterinarians. You’re likely going to 
be screened over the phone (to make certain you can provide a good — 
often indoor — home) before you’re invited to see the rabbits. Some groups 
require a home visit.
 
 Once the group decides you’re qualified to adopt a bunny, you’re 
directed to rabbits in the area in need of homes. More than likely, the 
bunnies needing adoption stay in local foster homes.
 
2. If you pass this initial prequalification, schedule an appointment to 
meet rabbits.
 
 The rescue coordinator sets up one or more appointments for you to 
meet rabbits. In many cases, the whole family is required to attend, 
which is a good way for rescue volunteers to observe everyone and talk 
about caring for the rabbit.
 
3. When meeting the foster parents, ask about the rabbit’s personality.
 
 The foster parent can give you his impressions of whether you (and 
your family) are a good match with this particular rabbit.
 
4. Watch the rabbit in his element: running around the house, hanging 
out in his hutch, and so on.
 
 Watching the rabbit provides a great way to see the animal’s personal-
ity. By visiting a rabbit in a foster home, where she’s comfortable, you 
get a good sense of who the rabbit really is. Ultimately the decision is 
yours, but the advice of someone who is knowledgeable about rabbits 
and knows an individual rabbit can be invaluable.
 
5. Look the rabbit over for signs of good health.
 
 For more on what to look for, see the upcoming section “Selecting the 
Rabbit.”
 
 Reputable rescue groups place only healthy rabbits for adoption, so ill-
ness should not be a problem. Still, it doesn’t hurt to be on the safe side.
 
6. Once you’ve found a good match and been approved for adoption, 
pay the adoption fee and sign an adoption agreement.
 
 The adoption fee generally runs about $65, and many rescue groups 
require you to sign an adoption agreement. Many times, a volunteer or 
the foster parents will follow up to see how things are going at home.

Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
Saving a stray
It may sound strange, but stray domestic rabbits are turning up more often 
in urban areas. These rabbits are usually family pets that have been dumped 
by uncaring owners who foolishly believe that a domesticated rabbit will be 
able to fend for herself in the wild. Sadly, such rabbits are unlikely to survive. 
If you happen across a stray rabbit in your yard or neighborhood, start by 
determining whether she is indeed a domestic rabbit. (Tell-tale signs include 
lop ears or a spotted, all-white, or angora coat. And unlike a domestic rabbit, 
a wild cottontail is unlikely to approach you or your home.)
It’s doubtful that you’ll be able to safely catch the rabbit, so you’ll need to 
call the local Humane Society to capture him or take matters into your own 
hands by following these steps:
 
1. Buy or borrow a humane trap.
 
 Typically, folks have to use a humane trap to catch a stray. The rabbit 
probably won’t let you approach him. Humane traps, which bait the 
rabbit and hold him until you’re ready to retrieve it, are available from
 
• Mail-order catalogs
 
• Humane societies
 
• Animal control agencies
 
• Fish and wildlife agencies
A voice for rabbits
The House Rabbit Society, founded in 1988 
by a group of seven rabbit lovers, serves as a 
true advocate for the companion rabbits of the 
world. The nonprofit group, which is bolstered 
by countless dedicated volunteers, is commit-
ted to rescuing abandoned rabbits and educat-
ing the public about rabbit care. Before HRS, 
many rabbits lived out their lives in outdoor 
hutches, isolated from human companionship 
and prone to illness and injury. Today, thanks to 
the organization’s efforts to educate the public 
about the joys of sharing one’s home with a 
rabbit, owners are better able to live with and 
care for their house rabbits.
In addition to improving bunnies’ lives, the 
group works to reduce the number of unwanted 
rabbits and has rescued and found homes for 
20,000 rabbits. Based in Richmond, California, 
the House Rabbit Society has chapters across 
the United States and the world. The organiza-
tion’s Web site offers information on adopting a 
rabbit as well as excellent educational materi-
als on behavior and health problems. For more 
information on the HRS or to find a chapter in 
your area, contact the House Rabbit Society at 
148 Broadway, Richmond, California 94804 or go 
to its Web site at www.rabbit.org.

61
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
 
• Wildlife rehabilitation centers
 
• Local pet-supply stores (to order)
 
 Buy a trap made of a lightweight material or that allows the tension to 
be set lightly on the trap door. A door that slams down hard on a rab-
bit’s back can permanently injure the animal’s spine.
 
2. Take the trap to where you’ve seen the rabbit, set it, and use pieces of 
carrot, strawberry, peach, or banana as bait.
 
 Try to set the trap early in the morning or evening, which is the time 
most rabbits feed. Avoid setting the trap at night when you won’t be 
able to monitor it. If the rabbit is trapped and a predator approaches it 
in the dark of night, the rabbit may literally be frightened to death.
 
3. Cover the trap with a dark towel or blanket, leaving the open door 
accessible.
 
 The darkness gives the rabbit a sense of security once it’s caught inside.
 
4. Check the trap every few hours to see whether the rabbit has entered it.
 
5. Take the bunny right away to a veterinarian experienced in rabbits.
 
 Ask the vet to examine the rabbit for any health problems and parasites. 
If the rabbit is in good health, you can take it home and provide it a good 
environment and diet. If the rabbit is suffering from a health problem, 
the vet can advise you on what is needed for treatment. (Parasites like 
fleas and ticks are almost certain to be present on the rabbit, especially 
in the spring, summer, and fall months.)
 
If you prefer not to capture the stray yourself, call your local Humane Society 
and ask it to pick up the rabbit. Keep in mind, though, that animal control may 
not have the manpower to trap the stray rabbit right away. Once the Humane 
Society retrieves the rabbit, you can begin adoption procedures. Most shelters 
hold new animals for a few days to see whether the pet was lost and will be 
claimed. Monitor the rabbit’s status on a daily basis so that you know exactly 
when the rabbit is available for adoption. Rabbits are wonderful escape artists 
(they can dig their way out of just about any yard if left unsupervised), and the 
stray rabbit you found might actually be someone’s lost pet. Once you capture 
the rabbit and bring it home, try
 
✓ Posting signs in the neighborhood where you found it.
 
✓ Noting your find in your local newspaper’s lost and found section (which 
are usually free).
 
✓ Contacting local veterinary clinics that deal with rabbits, animal shel-
ters, and animal control agencies where a person may have reported a 
lost animal.
If no one claims the rabbit after a month, you can feel pretty confident that 
you’ve rescued an abandoned pet.

Run free, wee bunny!
Audrey will never forget the time that she 
rescued a wild baby bunny from the jaws of 
a barn cat at the stable where she rode. The 
bunny was tiny — maybe 6 inches long — and 
seemed incredibly helpless. His ear was sliced, 
and he was bleeding, so she took the baby to 
a local vet who specialized in wildlife care. 
After gluing the baby’s ear back together, the 
vet gave the baby back to Audrey. “What do I 
do with him?” she asked, expecting to be told 
to bottle feed him and take care of him until he 
was fully grown.
“Just turn him loose near where you found 
him,” the vet said. “He’s old enough to take care 
of himself.” This experience taught Audrey that 
although wild baby bunnies may appear tiny and 
helpless, unless they’re newborn, they’re typi-
cally able to fend for themselves in the wild.
If you come across a baby bunny whose eyes 
are open, has fur on his body, and is hopping 
around on his own, he’s probably fine and 
better if left alone. Wild cottontails are weaned 
at 3 weeks of age and can fend for themselves 
early on.
If you find a nest of newborn baby bunnies, 
leave it alone. The mother is probably some-
where nearby. (Rabbit mothers have very rich 
milk and need to nurse their babies for only 
about 5 minutes a day). If you aren’t sure, you 
can check on the newborns for the next couple 
of days, being careful not to disturb them or 
loiter around enough that you scare away the 
mother. If the babies are crying constantly or 
are developing sunken-in stomachs, they’re 
probably orphaned. If you’re sure the babies are 
orphaned, the best approach is to find a quali-
fied wildlife rehabilitator in your area and turn 
the bunnies over to the rehabilitator. (Call your 
vet or local animal shelter for a referral.) Hand-
raising (nursing a baby animal with a bottle) 
wild rabbits is difficult, and an experienced 
rehabilitator is the only person for the job.
Considering Breeders
If you’re considering going to a breeder to find your rabbit, make sure that 
you check out Chapters 2 and 3 and are familiar with the various types of rab-
bits out there.
 
Unless you’re set on showing, consider getting a purebred or mixed breed 
from a shelter; more than a fair share of purebreds make their way to shelters. 
If you’re looking for a purebred for breeding, however, please see Chapter 
10, which covers some misconceptions and ethical issues related to hobbyist 
breeding.
If you’re still interested in a purebred rabbit, probably the best place to get 
one is a reputable rabbit fancier, a person of experience and knowledge who 
breeds to the point of excellence. Here are some good reasons to go in this 
direction:

63
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
 
✓ Responsible rabbit breeders take good care of their animals and can 
be an excellent source for a rabbit if you’re looking for a healthy, well-
socialized, purebred bunny.
 
✓ Breeders usually have baby bunnies available. However, a responsible 
breeder will not sell babies until they’re old enough to handle the stress 
of weaning and relocation. Typically, many of these breeders will not 
sell a baby until she is 12 weeks old.
 
✓ Your rabbit’s breeder will be a contact for life and can help you with 
bunny-related questions and problems that may come up. He may even 
be willing to help you get started in showing and breeding rabbits, if 
this is your ultimate goal. A responsible breeder will also take the rabbit 
back if you can’t keep it for any reason during the animal’s life.
 
✓ You may be able to meet your future rabbit’s sire and dam (father and 
mother) at the breeder’s rabbitry (the place where the rabbits are kept), 
which will give you a good idea of what your rabbit’s personality will 
be like.
 
✓ A good breeder will help you make smart decisions about whether 
you’re ready to take on a rabbit right now.
 
Here are some downsides:
 
✓ Lots of shelter rabbits out there need good homes.
 
✓ Buying from a breeder can be expensive (prices range from less than $25 
to more than $150).
 
✓ Breeders typically can’t offer insight into the challenges associated with 
house rabbits.
Getting a connection
 
You have these sources for finding rabbit breeders in your area:
 
✓ American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). ARBA is a national 
organization, but works with national clubs for each of the breeds it 
recognizes. These breed clubs keep records of all the breeders in the 
United States, and you can contact them for the names and numbers 
of breeders in your area. For a list of national rabbit breed clubs, see 
the Appendix. Keep in mind that just because a breeder is linked to 
the ARBA site doesn’t guarantee quality and responsibility; your own 
research is key.
 
✓ Local 4-H club. Most 4-H clubs have rabbit projects, usually run by 
breeders who volunteer in their spare time. You can find out who the 

64
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
rabbit contact is in your local 4-H club by contacting your County 
Extension office. You can find your County Extension office by calling 
directory assistance within your area code.
 
✓ Rabbit shows. ARBA shows are the best events to attend because you 
can find breeders of nearly every type of rabbit at these shows. Spend 
some time at the show and make conversation with breeders to see 
whether they have rabbits available for sale. Be sure to wait until after 
the breeder has finished showing in his class, however, because breed-
ers are usually busy readying rabbits just before they take the rabbit to 
the show ring. You can read more about shows in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Veterinarian with rabbit experience. These people know the respon-
sible breeders in the area; they see these animals in their practice after 
they’re sold as pets. Vets also receive personal recommendations of 
breeders from clients.
Checking out a breeder
Once you have come up with the name of a breeder or two, your next step is 
to scope out his or her rabbitry and find out if this is really the person from 
whom you wish to buy your rabbit.
 
Take the following steps to help make this decision:
 
✓ Call the breeder and ask her about the breeding operation. Your job is 
to get a sense of who the breeder is. Find out
 
• How many rabbit breeds this person is involved with. (Many 
breeders dabble in more than one breed and therefore may not be 
experts in any one breed.)
 
• How many rabbits this person currently keeps. If the breeder has 
more than a dozen or so rabbits, ask whether the breeder has 
help. It’s a lot of work to properly care for a large group of rabbits!
 
✓ While you’re on the phone with the breeder, find out whether she shows 
rabbits. This question is important for two reasons:
 
• A breeder involved with showing is an expert on the breed (or 
breeds) in her rabbitry.
 
• You can’t expect to buy a show-quality rabbit from a breeder who 
doesn’t show. If you’re looking to buy a rabbit you can show, the 
answer to this question is doubly important.
 
 On the topic of buying a show rabbit, make sure that you tell the 
breeder up front that you want a rabbit you can show. Expect to pay a 
higher price for a show-quality rabbit, especially if you’re shopping at a 
national rabbit show.

65
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
 
✓ Visit the breeder’s facilities. Ask him whether you can come and check 
out the rabbitry. If the breeder says no, even with an appointment, look 
for your rabbit elsewhere. A breeder who won’t allow buyers to see the 
general environment where his rabbits are kept is most likely hiding 
something. (However, some areas of the rabbitry may be off limits to 
visitors to protect from transmission of disease.)
 
 When you do visit the rabbitry, look for healthy rabbits in a clean envi-
ronment. That means the cages should be clean, and the smell shouldn’t 
be overwhelming. The rabbits themselves should be bright eyed, have 
well-groomed coats and be free of diarrhea or any respiratory ailments. 
(This chapter’s “Selecting the Rabbit” has more on what to look for.)
If you’re looking for a show prospect:
 
✓ Study the standard for your breed before you purchase the rabbit.
 
✓ Ask the breeder to select the best show animal available in the breed 
you’re seeking. The breeder should show you the rabbit’s coat and con-
formation (the way he’s put together), explaining how the rabbit holds 
up to the breed’s standard. The breed standard is the blueprint of the 
ideal rabbit.
 
✓ Ask the breeder to point out the rabbit’s good points and faults before 
you purchase.
 
✓ Try to get the best rabbit you can afford: the one with the least amount 
of faults.
 
Be aware that if you’re purchasing a very young rabbit, both you and the 
breeder won’t know for sure whether your rabbit will grow up to be a winner 
in the show ring. Only time will tell. (See Chapter 15 for more information 
about the show ring.)
Calling the classifieds
 
You may see ads for baby rabbits for sale, both purebred and mixed. You can 
certainly find a rabbit through the classified ads of a newspaper, but use cau-
tion with this approach for several reasons:
 
✓ Responsible breeders tend to use other methods to advertise their rab-
bits for sale (most often word of mouth).
 
✓ The classifieds aren’t a popular place to advertise rabbits, so you won’t 
have many ads to choose from.
 
✓ People who sell rabbits through classified ads are often not very knowl-
edgeable about rabbits and their care, and you may not find a healthy 
rabbit when you arrive at the seller’s home.

66
Par t I: Bringing on the Bunny Basics 
When pursuing these kinds of ads, be on the lookout for rabbits that may 
not be well cared for. Unlike rabbits placed up for adoption through reliable 
rescue groups, rabbits put up for adoption by individuals using classified ads 
have not been screened for good health. To get a sense of the rabbit’s gen-
eral health, ask to see where the rabbit is currently living and make sure that 
those quarters are clean. For more detailed health signs, see this chapter’s 
“Selecting the Rabbit.”
If the rabbit seems healthy, ask the owner whether you can take the bunny 
for a trial period. If the owner agrees, immediately take him to a veterinar-
ian for a full examination. If the rabbit is suffering from a health problem, 
the veterinarian will let you know what treatment is needed. You then have 
to decide whether you want to assume responsibility for a sick rabbit or 
whether you want to return the rabbit to its original owner.
Taking Precautions at Pet Shops
If you have a pet shop in your area that sells animals, an adorable baby 
bunny has probably lured you to a cage window. Although you can find rab-
bits for sale in many pet shops, especially around Easter (see Chapter 1), 
anyone considering a pet shop as a place to purchase a rabbit should think 
about the following points:
 
✓ A lot of unwanted rabbits who currently reside in shelters need 
homes. The people who run shelters and rescue groups believe that 
with so many mixed breed rabbits available for adoption, rabbit lovers 
have a moral obligation to avoid purchasing rabbits from pet shops.
 
✓ Rabbits sold in pet shops aren’t always purebred. Many are mixed 
breeds of unknown ancestry (not a bad thing unless you have your heart 
set on showing your rabbit). The few purebreds that you do find in pet 
shops are almost always “pet quality,” which means you can’t success-
fully exhibit them in ARBA rabbit shows.
 
✓ The breeding, socialization, and early health care are unknown. 
You won’t be able to examine the rabbitry where the bunny was born 
or meet its parents, so you won’t know much about the rabbit you’re 
buying or its background.
 
✓ The rabbit care information you receive from pet shop employees 
may be unreliable. Expertise on rabbits varies from pet store to pet 
store, and you have no way of knowing whether you’re getting the right 
answers to your questions.
 
✓ The fate of unsold rabbits is unclear. However, horror stories exist 
in which these rabbits are sold as snake food or returned to breeders 
where they’re euthanized. Purchasing a rabbit from a pet store may in 
fact perpetuate such practices.

67
 Chapter 4: Hiding in Shelters, Holes, and Shops
If you’d like to buy a rabbit from a pet shop in spite of these realities, make 
sure that you follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Take a close look at the conditions. The cage should be clean and have 
fresh water and hay available. Groups of rabbits should not be crowded 
into small cages; overcrowding causes stress and increases the likeli-
hood of disease.
 
✓ Examine the rabbit for good health. Follow the guidelines listed in the 
section “Selecting the Rabbit,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Make certain the pet store provides a health guarantee for the rabbit. 
If the rabbit becomes ill shortly after purchase (usually within 48 hours), 
the store should be willing to pay your vet bills. If the rabbit dies not 
long after you buy it, find out why it died. If the cause was related to the 
way the rabbit was cared for before you purchased it, you should be 
entitled to a refund. (A replacement rabbit is not an acceptable substi-
tute for a refund because a dead rabbit indicates a serious illness among 
the bunnies available at the store.)
Selecting the Rabbit
Whether your search has led you to a shelter, a rescue organization, or a 
breeder, it’s time to pick your rabbit. Though there’s a chance you’ll find 
someone ready to help you with the selection, your best bet is to be edu-
cated and prepared when you arrive.
Pet shop adoptions: Good news?
Advocates of rabbit adoption may have reason 
for hope when it comes to pet shops. In recent 
years, Petco has made the decision to stop sell-
ing very young rabbits, and whenever possible 
is teaming up with rescue groups who set up 
in-store adoption programs for rescued rab-
bits. The arrangement benefits all parties: The 
rescue groups have a new venue for housing 
the rabbits and educating the public about 
responsible rabbit care, the rabbits have a great 
chance of being placed with screened families, 
the families get a warm, fuzzy friend and a feel-
ing about doing something good, and the store 
gets a stream of new bunny owners who need 
to stock up on supplies. Petco is working to find 
local rescue groups that are able or willing to 
work with them. In cases where there is no 
local rescue, Petco will now sell only neutered 
or spayed rabbits.

Watching for signs of an ill rabbit
Make sure the rabbit you take home appears healthy. Unless you’re prepared 
for the extra money, work, and heartache involved in caring for a sick or special 
needs bunny, disregard any tugging heartstrings and keep the following in mind:
 
✓ Consider the general condition of the body. Be wary of a rabbit who 
feels too fat or too thin.
 
✓ Eyes should be clear and bright, with no signs of discharge.
 
✓ Ears should be pink and free of crust or discharge; a brownish, waxy 
residue inside an ear can be a sign of ear mites.
 
✓ A rabbit’s nose should not have any discharge; check the rabbit’s 
breathing for signs of respiratory difficulty.
 
✓ Take a peek at the teeth. If a rabbit’s lower teeth appear to extend in 
front of the upper teeth, or the incisors appear to be growing straight 
forward, sideways, or in other crazy directions, it’s a sign of malocclu-
sion, a problematic defect that affects a rabbits ability to chew properly. 
(Proper veterinary care can help control malocclusion.)
 
 In a normal rabbit, the upper incisors rest in front of the lower incisors, 
much like yours do when your mouth is completely closed.
 
✓ A rabbit’s coat should be soft, clean, and shiny, with no bare patches. 
Matting, soiling, or staining around the hindquarters may indicate diar-
rhea or some other problem.
 
✓ Check the feet to be certain they’re without sores.
 
✓ Watch the rabbit as it moves around; look for signs of lameness. A rabbit 
who is listless is probably not feeling well.
Keeping character in mind
Look for a personable rabbit. Even if you plan to show your rabbit, you’ll 
likely also want to enjoy your bunny as a pet. If possible, observe the rabbit in 
its home environment for clues about her personality. And although certain 
breeds are noted for particular personality traits, all rabbits are individuals 
and will behave as such. Use your detective skills to determine the following:
 
✓ How does the rabbit interact with other rabbits? Is he playful? 
Aggressive? Timid?
 
✓ How does the rabbit react to people? Look for a rabbit who is somewhat 
calm when approached and petted. Rabbits who kick repeatedly and 
bite when handled probably aren’t well socialized and may not make 
good pets, especially for those with children.

I
n the old days, rabbits were considered strictly outdoor animals. Even 
rabbits kept as pets were relegated to hutches out in the backyard — 
never to put their fuzzy little bunny paws inside a human dwelling. But luckily 
for both rabbits and pet owners, attitudes have changed on this topic.
These days, rabbits are allowed to live indoors — in close quarters with their 
human companions. In fact, not only are they allowed, but they’re also wel-
come! Many rabbit fans and advocates, not to mention veterinarians, recom-
mend that companion rabbits be housed indoors, and this chapter outlines 
many of the reasons for doing so. You must be wondering how in the world 
this works. Rabbits inside the house? Isn’t that the same as having a sheep or 
goat hanging around the living room? Well, not quite. This chapter explores 
the benefits of living with a house rabbit.
Getting Serious about Safety
When Nature was doling out the cards to determine who would be prey and 
who would be predator, the rabbit got the ace of spades. Just about every 
predator on the planet regards rabbits as fair game.
Rabbits that live outdoors — whether in the wild or in the confines of a back-
yard — are constantly at risk for becoming dinner. Even in suburban areas, 
nocturnal predators lurk, yearning for rabbit stew.

72
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
Even if your bunny is tucked away in a hutch, he isn’t completely safe. Critters, 
such as raccoons, are notorious for reaching their long arms between the wires 
of a rabbit hutch and grabbing for the terrified bunny. Other creatures — dogs, 
coyotes, snakes, and even cats — are attracted to a caged rabbit. Although 
most of these predators may not be able to gain access to the inside of the 
hutch, their mere presence can be enough to terrify your rabbit to death. (In 
the case of rabbits, “scared to death” is not an expression; rabbits can and do 
die of fright.)
Rabbits kept indoors are completely safe from predators that lurk in the 
night (provided your other pets are rabbit friendly; see Chapter 1). For that 
reason and others, the average lifespan of the indoor rabbit (7 to 12 years) is 
significantly higher (almost double) than his outdoor counterpart.
Taking Health Concerns to Heart
Pet rabbits that live outdoors in your yard are more susceptible to illness 
but not for the reasons that you may think. It’s not because thousands of 
airborne rabbit-nabbing germs are floating around your yard or because wild 
rabbits may drop by and spread illness. (Although in some areas, wild rab-
bits actually do spread illness to pet rabbits.)
The main reason that the outdoor life for a pet rabbit means a greater possi-
bility of illness is because outdoor bunnies spend less time with their owners. 
For a rabbit, less time with your owner means less likelihood of someone 
noticing that you’re sick.
The House Rabbit Society
In 1988, a group of seven rabbit lovers got 
together to form an organization designed to 
help rabbits: the House Rabbit Society. They 
firmly believed, among other things, that rab-
bits should live indoors with their human 
companions.
Before the House Rabbit Society was orga-
nized, some people kept rabbits inside, but they 
kept quiet about it. Rabbits were traditionally 
considered livestock and were supposed to live 
outside — or so most people thought. Today, 
with the help of the House Rabbit Society, which 
promotes keeping rabbits indoors, bunny lovers 
around the world are finding out firsthand that 
rabbits make great indoor pets. The organization 
provides information to rabbit owners on how 
to best care for and live with their house rab-
bits. (See the Appendix for contact information; 
Chapter 4 also talks more about the group.)

73
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
When rabbits don’t feel well, they let us know in a variety of subtle ways, 
such as a change in appetite or acting depressed and lethargic. Others 
sneeze, scratch, limp, and have changes in their stool or urine output. (See 
Chapter 9 for more information on rabbit health issues.) Rabbits are prey ani-
mals, and they naturally hide signs of disease, so they won’t become a snack 
for a predator the minute they’re feeling a bit under the weather. If you don’t 
spend much time with your rabbit, you’re less likely to actually see your pet 
limping, sneezing, or being lethargic. You’re also less likely to recognize any 
subtle yet important difference in your pet’s behavior.
Another problem for outdoor rabbits is weather. Although rabbits tolerate 
the cold weather, heat is a killer for bunnies. A particularly hot day can spell 
doom for an outdoor rabbit, and controlling the temperature in an outdoor 
rabbit hutch is difficult, if not impossible.
Bonding with Bunny
For people who live with house rabbits, one of the most important reasons to 
keep a bunny inside is for the incredible bonding experience it offers. Sure, you 
can still bond with your rabbit if he lives outside in a hutch, but spending more 
time with your pet can be achieved only if your pet lives under the same roof 
and within the same walls as you.
If you live with an indoor rabbit, you and your bunny can share the following 
activities:
 
✓ Watching TV: What could be more relaxing than to come home at night 
and cuddle up on the couch with your favorite plant-eating mammal?
 
✓ Reading: Your rabbit will love it if you sit in your most comfortable 
chair to supervise his playtime as he romps around the room while you 
read a book.
 
✓ Eating meals: If you’re a healthy eater who enjoys plenty of fresh fruits 
and vegetables, you can share your food with your rabbit.
 
✓ Playing together: You can play indoor games with your rabbit or simply 
sit by and watch him play on his own with his toys.
 
✓ Cleaning house: Watch your rabbit help you as you straighten up 
around the house. If he’s a real people-rabbit, he’ll follow you around 
and do his best to assist.

74
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Having Fun with Your Bun
Having any kind of rabbit is a hoot, but having an indoor rabbit is twice the 
fun. People who live with house rabbits can talk for hours about all the funny 
and adorable rabbit antics, such as how they hop into your lap while you’re 
napping, stare up at you from the ground while you’re making dinner, or curl 
up under the covers with you when you’re home sick from work.
Rabbits can be really hilarious to watch, too, as evidenced in Chapters 14 
and 15. Playing with their toys, chasing each other (if you have more than 
one), or kicking up their heels in sheer joy — indoor rabbits enjoy all these 
antics, and indoor rabbit owners can easily view them.
 
One of the many reasons for keeping your rabbit indoors is all the neat stuff 
that you’ll witness. (Chapter 11 gives details about reading your rabbit’s body 
language.) For example:
 
✓ Sounds: You get to hear all the sounds that rabbits make. They make 
a honking noise when they want attention from you or are begging for 
something to eat. A kind of purring sound resonates from a rabbit who 
is happily being scratched behind the ear while you’re watching TV, and 
they “cluck” when you give them a snack that they really enjoy.
 
✓ Body language: A relaxed house rabbit expresses himself physically as 
well as vocally. A completely stretched out rabbit is happy, secure, and 
content. A rabbit who has flopped over on his side or back is in a deep 
sleep and probably dreaming. A shuddering bunny has just smelled 
something that he doesn’t like.
 
✓ Many moods: Just like people, rabbits have shifting moods. Your pet 
may feel playful on any given day but act relaxed and sleepy the next 
day. One evening, he may beg for affection, but tomorrow, he’s content 
to just huddle on a cushion nearby.
Making Sure That Everyone’s 
Comfy: Rabbit Essentials
To keep your rabbit indoors, you need to know how to provide the right 
environment. Having an indoor rabbit doesn’t mean that you let your little 
hopper have the run of the place. Far from it. You need to provide a well 
thought out and careful environment for your rabbit, for both his sake and 
yours. That journey begins with the appropriate rabbit supplies.

75
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
 
You can easily find items for your rabbit if you know where to look. Pet store 
chains and independent pet stores are good sources, as are mail-order cata-
logs for pet products. A number of general online pet-supply resources carry 
rabbit products, and some Web sites carry goodies exclusively for rabbits. 
(See the Appendix for contact information on a number of these sources.)
Your indoor rabbit’s cage is just one of several items that you need to pick 
up and accessorize at a pet-supply store before you bring your bunny home. 
Scope out the following house rabbit necessities:
 
✓ Litter box: All good house rabbits know how to use a litter box, and yours 
should be no exception. Get a box that’s small enough to fit into your rab-
bit’s cage yet large enough for your bunny to sit in comfortably. A small 
cat litter box will do, or you can find a rabbit-size box in a bunny catalog 
or on an Internet shopping site; a small plastic shoebox may even do the 
trick. Figure 5-1 is an example of a box that fits into the cage’s corner. (See 
this chapter’s “When Littering is Good: The Litter Box” for advice on litter 
box training your rabbit.)
  
 Be certain that the box is deep enough to contain your rabbit’s spray; 
rabbits urinate horizontally out behind them, not downwards like a cat 
or dog.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Please don’t 
litter! Try a

hugging lit-
ter box for 
your bunny.
 

76
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
✓ Litter: You need to put something inside that litter box besides your 
rabbit. Your choice of litter material is important because of the amount 
of time your rabbit will spend in her litter box and because most rabbits 
tend to eat some litter along the way. Check out what rabbit folks are 
saying about the different litters:
 
• Do not use your cat’s clay-based litter. The dust irritates the rab-
bit’s respiratory tract; some rabbits have eaten the clay litter, 
resulting in a fatal intestinal impaction.
 
• Avoid cedar and pine beddings. Although they smell nice to the 
human nose, these products may cause liver damage in rabbits.
 
• Pelleted bedding is more absorbent than clay and, if eaten, not 
harmful to the rabbit. In addition, pelleted bedding tends to draw 
moisture away from the surface so that it remains drier where the 
rabbit is sitting. Suitable bedding material includes those made of 
aspen, paper, cellulose, and compressed sawdust.
 
• Corn cob bedding isn’t very absorbent and can also cause intesti-
nal blockages.
 
• Although newspapers are absorbent, they don’t control odor (and 
bunny urine is potent!). Some owners go with the old stand-by of 
lining the box with paper and then adding a layer of hay, changing 
both the paper and hay daily).
 
✓ Food bowl or feeder: You see all kinds of food bowls in the store, but 
the crock-style bowls are the best kind (see Figure 5-2). These ceramic 
containers work great because they’re hard to tip over, and rabbits are 
notorious tippers. Make sure that the bowl you buy isn’t too deep for 
your rabbit to reach into. Too much depth is primarily a concern with 
baby bunnies and small dwarf breeds. Keep in mind that bowls are easy 
to clean: Just throw them in the dishwasher.
 
Figure 5-2:

notorious 
tendency for 
rabbits to tip

ceramic 
food bowls.
 

77
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
 
✓ Water bottle: Instead of providing a bowl of water like you would for a 
cat or dog, give your rabbit a gravity water bottle, like the kind used for 
guinea pigs and hamsters. This bottle, shown in Figure 5-3, has a metal 
tube at the end with a metal ball in the tip. These bottles keep the water 
accessible without letting it drip. When your rabbit is thirsty, he can sip 
from the metal tip of the water bottle. Some rabbits prefer water bowls, 
but that can lead to lots of mess when the bowl gets tipped over (and 
over and over . . .).
 
Figure 5-3: 
Honey 
may be the 
nectar of 
the gods, 
but water is 
pretty darn 
important to 
rabbits.
 
 
✓ Nest box: Rabbits take great comfort in having a small, dark space 
where they can huddle when they need time to themselves. Check out 
the huddling rabbit in Figure 5-4. A nest box, tucked into a corner of 
your rabbit’s cage, can provide that comfort. You can purchase a nest 
box from a rabbit-supply catalog or Internet site. Get one that’s made of 
metal with a wood floor or wood covered with metal mesh.
 
 If you opt for a wood-only box, your rabbit will soon gnaw the box to pieces.
 
✓ Bedding: Put something in your rabbit’s nest box to make it cozy for 
sleeping. You can use the same rabbit-friendly material, pelleted or 
otherwise, that you put in the litter box, adding a layer of hay on top 
to make it more nest-like. Avoid cedar or pine bedding because of the 
health risks. (See this chapter’s section on safe litter choices.) A soft 
towel or T-shirt will be appreciated by bunnies who like a little extra 
something to nest in.

ing box?
 
 
✓ Hayrack: Roughage is important in a rabbit’s diet (see Chapter 7), and 
your bunny should always have a supply of fresh grass hay available 
for noshing. To keep the hay from being strewn all over your rabbit’s 
house — and yours — you need a hayrack that hangs from the side of the 
cage. The rack, shown in Figure 5-5, keeps the hay in place as your rabbit 
munches on it throughout the day. Metal hayracks are available from 
rabbit-supply retailers.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Hay — all

79
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
 
✓ Chew blocks: Rabbit teeth are continually growing, and rabbits have a 
strong urge to gnaw as a result. Buy your bunny some chew blocks made 
for small animals so that he can work those teeth on the blocks (rather 
than your furniture); some rabbit caretakers have had success fastening 
a piece of unfinished wood trim to the cage. Chapter 14 has information 
on how to deal with rabbits who chew on your prized antique chaise 
lounge legs. The “Chewing,” section, later in this chapter, offers tips on 
preventing unwanted chewing.
 
✓ Toys: Rabbits love to play. Pick up a few toys for your pet while you’re out 
shopping for supplies. Rabbits enjoy most cat toys, especially balls with 
bells in them. You can also give your pet homemade toys, such as empty 
toilet paper rolls, wooden blocks, and cardboard boxes. Use toys that are 
safe for your pet to chew, because he most likely will! Chapter 14 talks 
about toys in depth.
 
✓ First-aid kit: A first-aid kit doesn’t have much to do with a rabbit’s cage, 
but it’s still a very, very good idea. See Chapter 9 for details on what 
kinds of goodies you’ll need in a first-rate first-aid kit.
Craving His Cage
Yes, even though your rabbit is living inside the house, he still needs a cage. 
Rather than thinking of it as a jail of sorts, think of your rabbit’s enclosure as 
a den — that is, a place that he can call his own.
 
A rabbit’s cage is not where your companion will get the exercise he needs to 
stay healthy (at least two hours a day). Exercise, both of the indoor and out-
door varieties, is covered in Chapter 8.
The purpose of your indoor rabbit’s cage is to provide a confined spot 
for your rabbit when you can’t supervise him. Because pet rabbits have a 
strong desire to hide in enclosed spaces left over from their wild ancestry, 
your rabbit can appreciate having such a place where he can go to rest and 
escape from the world. You can appreciate having a private place for him 
to go because your rabbit shouldn’t be out and about in your house unless 
you can keep a close eye on him. You can also use pens to achieve a sense 
of security (his) and peace of mind (yours). (See the section “Putting a Pen 
to Good Use,” later in this chapter, for more on that topic.) (You also need 
to purchase and outfit a smaller travel carrier for trips to the veterinarian or 
elsewhere. (Chapter 16 covers traveling with your pet in detail.)
You can buy an indoor rabbit cage at a pet-supply store, through a catalog, 
or over the Internet. Shop carefully for a setup that suits your needs; look for 
a cage on a stand for someone with a bad back, for example, or something 
with drawers below for those without much space for bunny gear. (See the 
Appendix for shopping sites and catalogs.) Figure 5-6 shows a good example 
of a basic indoor cage.

80
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
Your rabbit’s indoor cage should:
 
✓ Be large enough for the rabbit to turn around comfortably and stand 
up on his hind legs without his ears touching the top. If your rabbit is a 
baby, be sure to buy a cage that can fit him when he’s grown. The House 
Rabbit Society recommends that a cage be at least four times the size of 
your rabbit, and more if he’ll be in there a lot. Of course, this size is the 
absolute minimum. Your rabbit is much happier with even more space 
to call his own, and here’s why:
 
• Rabbits without enough space to move around often become bored.
 
• Small spaces are quickly fouled with urine and feces, which creates 
an unhealthy environment for the rabbit.
 
•  Rabbits without enough room to exercise have a greater chance of 
becoming obese.
 
✓ Have enough room to accommodate a small litter box, a nesting box 
(big enough for the rabbit to fit into), a food bowl, a water bottle, and 
a hayrack. Openings should be no larger than 1 by 2 inches. Anything 
bigger, and the rabbit may catch his leg or head in it.
 
 Aquariums or cages with solid walls don’t provide adequate ventilation 
and are very dangerous.
 
✓ Have a floor made of plastic slats or have a solid floor, particularly 
if you’re planning to litter box train your rabbit. Another option is a 
bottom made of wire, with square openings of about ½ inch; a slide-out 
tray below the wire catches waste material. Line the tray with newspaper 
or pelleted beddings. However, a wire bottom can be tough on a bunny’s 
feet, so be sure to provide a resting board or a piece of washable carpet to 
give her tootsies a break.

 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
 
✓ Include a side door for your rabbit to enter through the cage. (How 
else will he hop in when it’s time to take care of his bathroom business?) 
When the door is open, you can cover the mesh with a towel to make a 
more comfortable entrance/exit ramp. For your convenience, try to get 
a cage that also opens from the top. Being able to open the cage roof 
and reach inside makes feeding your pet or taking your rabbit out (if you 
need to) much easier.
 
✓ Be designed for a rabbit’s physique. You may see some pretty fancy, 
multi-level cages on the market designed for rabbits, but buyer beware. 
If the ramps are too steep, injuries may result. Rabbits are land animals 
and don’t feel safe when high above the ground. In addition, the vertical 
nature of the cage gives the false impression that the rabbit has enough 
space, when, in fact, it’s the horizontal space that’s important for exercise 
and movement. For these reasons, we caution against many-tiered cages 
(four-plus tiers) for rabbits, ferrets, or guinea pigs. They simply don’t fit 
with the animals’ natural physiology and psyche.
 
Where you put your rabbit’s cage is even more important than what it looks 
like. Rabbits are sensitive to climate and air quality and can quickly become ill 
if they’re exposed to the wrong things. Keep the following in mind when you 
think about where you place your indoor rabbit’s cage:
 
✓ Avoid placing the cage in an area of your house where dramatic and 
extreme temperature fluctuations take place frequently. High heat and 
humidity are particularly dangerous. Rabbits, other pets, or humans, for 
that matter, do not need a constant temperature range all the time. Some 
fluctuation is healthy; just try to avoid the extremes (such as near heat-
ing or air-conditioning vents, which can also blow out dust that irritates 
your pet’s respiratory tract).
Home sweet home
Even though house rabbits typically spend a 
good portion of the day free in your home, yours 
will appreciate having a place to retreat to for 
times of rest and relaxation. You can do several 
things to make your rabbit feel like her cage is 
a place of refuge:
 ✓ Don’t use her cage as punishment.
 ✓ Make her feel safe at “home” by not doing 
things to her in her cage that she doesn’t 
like.
 ✓ Keep it clean, but don’t clean the cage with 
your bun in it.
 ✓ Don’t force your bunny out of her nest box 
or cage against her will.
 ✓ Keep it cozy, with toys, a soft blanket or 
towel, and an occasional treat.

82
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
✓ Never expose the cage to direct sunlight. The sun’s rays when magnified 
through glass can become hot and can cause heat stroke in a rabbit. Even 
direct sunlight through a window screen can be dangerous for a rabbit.
 
✓ An attic or basement is no place for a rabbit cage. The dampness and 
lack of ventilation in these areas can prove hazardous to your pet’s health.
 
✓ The cage should be in a well-lit area where people come and go. 
However, don’t place it in a spot where your rabbit never has any peace 
and quiet.
 
✓ Place the cage where the bunny can experience at least eight hours of 
darkness. Constant bright lighting with no relief or inconsistent lighting 
(one night up late, next night not) can wreak havoc on a rabbit’s endo-
crine system, which has some dependency on photoperiods for its func-
tion. At the least, cover the cage with a heavy cloth or towel that blocks 
light for at least eight hours out of each 24-hour period.
 
✓ Don’t put the cage near stereo speakers or a TV. The noise may put 
undo stress on your rabbit’s sensitive nerves.
Putting a Pen to Good Use
Some people, especially those with multiple bunnies, opt for a different hous-
ing arrangement, such as a puppy or exercise pen. Such pens, found in pet 
stores or dog-supply catalogs, are comprised of 3 to 4-foot high by 2 to 4-foot 
long metal wire panels that quickly hook together with a long pin to make 
an enclosure (see Figure 5-7). You can easily step over the fencing to gain 
entrance, or you can remove one pin and open the fencing. You can move 
the panels into a variety of shapes and use them indoors or out. This option 
is an easy and economical way to confine your rabbit to an area of the home 
or outdoors, yet it’s also moveable. And when the panels aren’t in use, you 
can fold the entire apparatus completely flat and store it against a wall or in 
a closet in a matter of minutes. The size that you get depends on the rabbits, 
but, of course, the larger, the better. For large breed rabbits, we recommend 
the 4-foot fencing; other breeds do fine with 3-foot fencing.
In addition, if you have carpeting or want to protect a floor, you can buy a 
hard-plastic chair mat, carpet protector, or a sheet of no-wax flooring and 
place it under the fenced-in area; it doesn’t have to be really high quality. The 
flooring can easily be rolled up and moved should you need to do so. Voilà! 
You have no problems with soiled carpet or digging into carpet. The rabbit 
can have the run of the pen and still be in the room with you without danger 
of getting into mischief. The mats are invaluable, and some local House 
Rabbit Society chapters use them in foster homes.

83
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
Another option is to leave the fencing up all the time around a cage as a per-
manent exercise area. This approach works great outside (better and safer 
with a top enclosure) as well, and you can also move it around the yard. (See 
Chapter 8 for more on the important benefits of fitness and fresh air.) Of 
course, don’t leave your rabbit in his pen outside without careful supervision.
Rabbit-Proofing Your House
A big reason for keeping your rabbit inside instead of out is so that you can 
share house time with your pet. But before you let your rabbit go running 
through the halls, you need to take some precautions. These measures aren’t 
only for the safety of your rabbit — who can get into more trouble than you 
can possibly imagine — but also for the well-being of your home.
In order to adequately protect your house and your rabbit, get an idea of 
exactly what kinds of problems rabbits can get into when left to their own 
devices inside your home. Take a look at Figure 5-8 to see what areas you 
need to address before bringing a bunny into your home. Fortunately, you 
can take advantage of the clever rabbit-proofing ideas of others to make your 
job simpler.

Identifying trouble spots
Rabbits love to tuck themselves away into little corners. They’re also curious 
and love to investigate new places. Put this combination together, and you 
have potential for trouble in the house.
Before you give your bunny access to a room:
 
✓ Get down on all fours and look around carefully. Much like the parent 
of an inquisitive toddler, you should take a look at your home from your 
rabbit’s perspective. Your rabbit won’t know the difference between 
an interesting new snack and something dangerous, such as medicine, 
the contents of an ashtray, and other small not-to-be-digested objects. 
Better safe than sorry!

85
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
 
✓ Find any small spaces that your rabbit may be able to get into. Look 
closely — even in your kitchen and bathroom cabinets, and under and 
behind appliances — for gaps or holes that may look inviting to a rabbit. 
Your bunny is apt to crawl into one of these spots and possibly get 
trapped; open railings can be dangerous as well.
 
✓ Locate all exposed electrical wires and telephone and computer cords. 
It’s a simple but deadly fact: rabbits are fond of chewing on wires. The 
next section on chewing outlines ways of preventing tragedy in this area.
 
✓ Block nooks and crannies in furniture with heavy objects so that your 
rabbit won’t be able to get inside and get stuck. Rabbits have been 
known to burrow inside recliners and sofa beds with disastrous results; 
taking the proper precautions can help prevent this problem.
 
✓ Put away and lock up toxic chemicals. Make sure that no toxic 
chemicals — pesticides, cleaning supplies, antifreeze, fertilizers, and 
so on — are placed within reach of your rabbit.
 
✓ Give away or relocate any plants that can make your rabbit sick — or 
worse. See Chapter 8 for more information on toxic plants.
 
✓ Be certain that trash bags and buckets are well out of bunny’s reach. 
Bunnies are curious and will be happy to explore the contents of your 
trash. Enough said.
Chewing
Rabbits have a tremendous urge to gnaw. Although it is perfectly natural — 
and even necessary for healthy teeth — and loads of fun for a rabbit, chewing 
can result in plenty of grief for both rabbits and their owners if they chew on 
the wrong things.
When inside a home, rabbits tend to make a beeline for the following objects, 
with teeth bared:
 
✓ Carpet edges
 
✓ Electrical cords
 
✓ Telephone cords
 
✓ Wooden furniture legs
 
As you can well imagine, rabbit teeth can do plenty of damage to these items 
and more (for example, books and shoes). In a short time, wooden furniture 
legs can be permanently disfigured, telephone cords can be rendered use-
less, and carpet edges can be chomped and swallowed (a serious health risk). 
Electrical cords that have been chewed through can be fatal for a rabbit and 
may even start a fire in your home.

86
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
However, you can enjoy your indoor rabbit without having to worry about 
those destructive teeth:
 
✓ Limit your rabbit’s activities to one or two rooms of the house.
 
✓ Don’t let your rabbit run loose in the house without your constant 
supervision.
 
✓ Cover wooden furniture legs in accessible rooms with bubble wrap or 
thick plastic (see Figure 5-9).
 
Figure 5-9: 
Plastic is 
pretty . . .

safe, that is.
 
 
✓ Put telephone cords well out of reach — beyond the grasp of rabbits 
who like to hop up onto chairs.
 
✓ Cover electrical cords with plastic aquarium tubing by cutting the 
tube lengthwise and slipping it over the cord (see Figure 5-10).
 
✓ Leave chew toys around the room so that your rabbit can chew on 
them instead of something he shouldn’t.
Putting off the perfume
I don’t recommend spraying perfume on furni-
ture legs to put off your chewy pet. Certain ani-
mals have been known to develop respiratory 
disease from perfumes, and in the case of birds, 
some fatalities have occurred. Highly aromatic 
perfumes and perfumes that contain plenty of 
alcohol, which helps the scent spread, have 
been implicated most often. Don’t use these 
products. It has also been my experience that 
most products that are designed to keep dogs 
and cats off of furniture do not work on rabbits.

Digging
Another bad bunny habit is digging. Rabbits love to dig. In the wild, they 
create their dens by excavating. A problem arises, however, when rabbits 
running loose in the house decide that they want to dig a tunnel through 
your carpeting. They usually choose a loose corner of the carpet to start 
their excavation. They also choose doorways if the door is closed, so you 
often need to protect the lower part of the door with Plexiglas or the like to 
keep them from damaging the wood. If this digging goes unnoticed, they can 
quickly tear up a good portion of the rug. In addition, if they eat the carpet, 
the fibers are indigestible, and the ingestion of enough of them can lead to an 
intestinal impaction.
To keep your four-legged shovel from messing up your carpeting:
 
1. Check all the corners of the room where your rabbit will be roaming.
 
2. Place heavy objects in the corners so that your rabbit can’t get a toe-
hold on a loose area of the rug.
 
3. Make sure that carpet edges are securely tacked down.
 
 You can cover them with a heavy plastic rug protector, such as the ones 
sold to protect rugs under office furniture. These rug protectors are 
often found in office-supply stores and are made of clear heavy plastic 
with spikes on the back to hold them in place on the carpet. They can 
be cut to different sizes and help protect carpet corners from your rab-
bit’s digging and soiling. You can also use a clear plastic carpet runner 
protector found in many hardware or carpeting stores. They’re all 
smooth enough that when the rabbit digs at them, they get nowhere. 

88
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Alternatively, you can use sheets of Plexiglas in the digging areas, but 
they’re harder to secure.
 
4. Encourage your rabbit to dig somewhere else.
 
 Provide him with a box full of sand, soil, shredded paper, or old towels 
that he can rummage through. Make sure that the box is deep enough to 
keep the material inside when your rabbit starts to excavate but not so 
deep that your rabbit can’t jump in or out.
 
Rabbits also like to dig at furniture. Your favorite couch, chair, or bed may 
be shredded. Protect these areas with a heavy cloth covering or prevent the 
rabbit from having access to them.
When Littering Is Good: The Litter Box
One of the reasons that rabbits make such good indoor companions is that 
you can train them to use a litter box. Their denning instinct, inherited from 
their wild ancestors, is the reason behind this behavior. Rabbits prefer not to 
go to the bathroom where they eat and sleep and venture out of their dens to 
relieve themselves. Not unlike toddlers who are going through toilet training, 
some bunnies are easier to train than others when it comes to using the litter 
box. With these holdouts, you need to expend more time and patience.
Keep in mind that successful litter box training may be hampered by an 
intact rabbit’s hormonally inspired territorial spraying — yet another reason 
to spay or neuter your rabbit as soon as possible.
 
When training a rabbit to use the litter box, being consistent and praising 
your rabbit is important. Never scold your rabbit for not using the litter box 
because it only frightens and confuses her.
To begin preparing for your bunny’s litter box training, first purchase an 
appropriate box and litter. You can read more about litter boxes — what they 
look like, what to put in them, and how to clean them in the section “Making 
Sure That Everyone’s Comfy: Rabbit Essentials,” earlier in this chapter.
 
When your rabbit is first discovering how to use the litter box, don’t clean up 
after her too often. If her box is too clean, she may forget why it’s there. Clean 
it a couple of times a week, and that’s it.
Encouraging your bunny to go in her cage
You can start your bunny’s training within a small area. Starting litter train-
ing in your rabbit’s cage is best because it provides your bunny with plenty 

89
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
of opportunities to use the box. Gradually work your way up to larger spaces 
until he’s using the box even when he has the run of the place.
 
1. If your rabbit already has a corner of the cage where she likes to go to 
the bathroom, place the box in this area.
 
 Putting some of her fecal pellets and urine-soaked paper in the box can 
help her get the idea.
 
2. Attach the box to the side with a clip or twistable wire for removal 
when cleaning.
 
3. If she doesn’t start using the box right away, put a nice bunch of grass 
hay in it to attract her attention.
 
4. If you see her go to the bathroom in the litter box, give her a treat and 
some gentle verbal praise.
 
 With consistent reward, your bunny should get the idea in no time.
If your rabbit takes to sitting in the box and just hanging out there or chew-
ing on the hay that you put there, don’t be concerned. Rabbits often eat and 
go to the bathroom at the same time. Rabbits won’t eat soiled hay, so don’t 
worry about that. But munching on the clean hay stimulates your rabbit’s 
digestive system and causes her to use the box in the way that you intended.
 
If you find that your rabbit is sleeping in her litter box instead of using it as 
a toilet, you should provide her with a more attractive bed than the one that 
she has. Try using a different bedding material or giving her a more private 
nest box.
Providing 1.5 bathrooms
When you see your rabbit regularly using her litter box (which can take 
anywhere from a week to a month or more), you can give her more room to 
roam without worrying too much about her going potty outside the box. Now 
you’re ready to train her to use a litter box in other areas of the house.
 
1. Set up a special room for your bunny.
 
 A kitchen, bathroom, or hallway are acceptable places. Make sure that 
they’re small, low-traffic areas.
 
2. Use a baby gate to section off the area.
 
 You can also use a pen to set up an area for training. The section “Putting 
a Pen to Good Use,” earlier in this chapter, has more information.
 
3. Put the litter box in the corner of the special area.
 
 Rabbits often like to pick their own areas, so your best bet may be 
moving the box once the rabbit has selected her favorite spot.

90
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
4. Place your rabbit’s food, water, and bedding in another part of the room.
 
5. Keep an eye on your rabbit to make sure that she uses the litter box 
on a regular basis.
 
 Be patient! The more consistent attention you give to this process, the 
better.
 
6. If you see her go to the bathroom in the litter box, give her a treat and 
gentle verbal praise.
 
If your rabbit starts making mistakes at any point in this process, it may be a 
simple, temporary mishap. It may also have something to do with your rab-
bit’s natural urges to mark territory as her own or the following issues:
 
✓ You may have placed her in a bigger space too soon. In this situation, 
the best approach is to take a small step back. Put the box back in your 
bunny’s cage and reaccustom her to using the box in her cage.
 
✓ You may have not given her enough (or the “right”) litter boxes. Buy 
a few more litter boxes and place them strategically around the house; 
try a different type of box, if necessary. You can put more than one in 
a room or put a box in each room that your rabbit frequents. With so 
many litter box options to choose from, chances are that your rabbit 
will get it right.
 
 If you don’t want to keep that many boxes around the house perma-
nently, you can try removing them one by one. See whether your rabbit 
seeks out the closest box, even if it’s in the next room. If so, you’ve prob-
ably successfully trained your rabbit to use the litter box.
 
 If you have more than one rabbit in your household, make sure that you 
provide at least one more litter box than the number of rabbits in the 
room. Some rabbits won’t use a litter box if it’s been used by a more 
dominant rabbit.
 
✓  A rabbit with a health problem. A bunny who seems to be dribbling 
urine may have a bladder problem or an infection of the urinary tract. 
Consult your vet.
Once your rabbit does her business in the box on a regular basis, you can 
give her more room. Move the entire operation to a bigger space, such as the 
living room or a bedroom. Eventually, you should be able to let your rabbit 
have access to all the rabbit-proofed rooms in your house and count on her 
to use the litter box every time.
Cleaning up
During the litter box training process, accidents are inevitable. Cleanup is 
easier if you protect the area under and around the litter box with newspaper 
or a heavy plastic carpet protector pad. If you find that your bunny’s spray 

91
 Chapter 5: Shacking Up with an Indoor Rabbit
is missing the litter box, check that the box is deep enough for him. (Rabbits 
urinate horizontally out behind them.)
Clean up after your pet; pick up fecal pellets with a tissue, and wash urine 
marks on carpeting with a mixture of vinegar and water. You can use one of 
the enzyme pet accident cleaners on the market. If your bunny urinates on 
wood flooring, use gentle dish soap and water or cleansers made for hard-
wood floors.
 
Rabbit droppings make a great addition to your compost pile. Simply drop the 
goods on your heap, mix, and let it cook. For more on composting, an online 
search can lead you to more than you’d ever want to know about the wonders 
of bunny poop. (Check out the House Rabbit Network’s articles at www.rabbit
network.org/articles/compost.shtml.) You can find tons of good 
books about composting as well.
Keeping a Squeaky Clean Home
 
One of the most important factors to a rabbit’s good health is cleanliness. A 
clean environment means a healthy rabbit. A dirty environment means the 
potential for a rabbit with chronic health problems.
Of course, that’s not the only reason to keep a rabbit’s area sanitary. In the 
case of the indoor rabbit, your house suffers if you don’t keep up after your 
rabbit’s hygiene.
If you perform the following duties with the frequency specified, you 
shouldn’t have a problem with your rabbit or your house:
Litter box cleaning
Clean the litter box every three days. If your rabbit is litter box trained, your 
cage-cleaning duties are much easier:
 
1. If you’re using appropriate pelleted bedding with one litter box per 
rabbit, change the litter completely.
 
2. Look for other areas in the cage where your rabbit may have gone to 
the bathroom (including the nest box) and clean those up, too.
 
3. Check the stools and urine daily to see whether any abnormalities are 
present.
 
 If a rabbit is ill, use a small amount of litter and change it daily to 
observe any abnormalities. Changing the litter daily can be expensive. If 
you want to routinely change litter daily, use much smaller amounts in 
the box, such as 1 inch.

92
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Daily cage duty
You’ll want to perform cage duty daily. If you’re feeding your rabbit a proper 
diet, you no doubt have some food to clean up inside your rabbit’s cage. 
Here’s what you need to do on a daily basis:
 
1. Remove any fresh fruit and vegetables that your rabbit has left behind.
 
 See Chapter 7 for more on feeding.
 
2. Wash out your rabbit’s food bowl and water bottle.
 
3. Remove any stray pieces of hay that have fallen from the hayrack.
Weekly cage cleaning
In addition to your daily check of the cage, you’ll want to give your rabbit’s 
cage a good, thorough cleaning with mild disinfectant once a week. A solution 
of one part bleach to ten parts of water is effective against a wide range of 
germs. Here’s what you need to do on a weekly basis:
 
1. Clean surfaces of debris.
 
2. Keep the solution in contact with the surface for 30 minutes.
 
3. Rinse off the bleach solution and let the cage thoroughly dry before 
you place the rabbit back into it.
 
4. Soak food and water bowls/bottles in this bleach solution weekly for 
30 minutes and then rinse in a good disinfectant or put through a 
dishwasher.
 
Never clean any animal-related items, particularly those containing fecal mate-
rial or urine, in the kitchen sink where food is prepared for human consump-
tion. Use the bathtub or the bathroom sink and rinse well afterwards.

▶ Feeding your bunny the right food
▶ Avoiding overweight rabbits

T
hat old adage, “You are what you eat,” doesn’t just apply to humans. This 
truth applies to rabbits, too. Feed your rabbit a healthy and complete diet, 
and he’ll be a healthy, happy-go-lucky bunny.
Providing a healthy diet for your bunny is much more involved than just 
dumping a cup of pellets in his food bowl every day. Rabbits need variety in 
their diet, just like humans do, and with just a little effort, you can provide all 
the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and food energy that your rabbit needs.
Supplying Your Bunny with Belly Timber
Before you start feeding your rabbit, knowing that your rabbit is a herbivore is 
important. Herbivores eat only plants. Because rabbits are herbivores, every-
thing they eat consists of plant material. So don’t give your bunny a steak. Not 
only will his nose turn up at it, but also the smell of it will probably scare the 
heck out of him. To get the proper nutrients a rabbit needs, your pet depends 
on you for good, fresh foods. (Chapter 2 details more about a rabbit’s body and 
helps you understand why a good diet is so important.) You need to under-
stand some basic things about your bunny’s biological needs:
 
✓ Bunnies dig grazing in the grass. In the wild, rabbits are grazers, which 
means they spend a significant amount of time roaming from plant to 
plant as they nibble. In nature, rabbits have a wide variety of plants at 
their disposal and are thus able to get all the nutrients that they need 
from them. Domestic rabbits, though, have no choice in the matter of diet. 
They depend on their owners to provide them with variety of nutritious 
foods — grass hay, vegetables, quality pelleted feed, and some fruits.

94
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
✓ Water is vital to life. Water makes up a substantial portion of the mam-
malian body, and rabbits are no exception. Rabbits drink a little over a 
quarter cup of water per pound of rabbit per day. This amount can be 
more if the temperature is warm or the rabbit is exercising, and less if 
the rabbit is eating a lot of water-containing foods, like vegetables and 
fruits. Without water, rabbits die quickly. Not only is water itself essen-
tial to keeping the vital organs working properly, but it also aids diges-
tion and keeps the rabbit’s body cool in hot weather.
 
 Rabbits must have fresh water at their disposal at all times. You should 
replace the water in their water bottles with fresh water every single day, 
without exception. Providing your rabbit with bottled or filtered water is 
all the better. Rabbits, like humans, can do without the impurities present 
in most tap water.
 
✓ Gradual change is better. The digestive system of a rabbit is unlike that 
of a human or even a dog or cat. Rabbits depend on a variety of intesti-
nal bacteria to break down their food. When dietary changes are made 
too quickly (like giving your bunny a pile of strawberries or switching 
to a “gourmet” pellet), this intestinal balance is thrown off, making the 
rabbit sick. When adding new foods to your bunny’s diet, do so one food 
at a time, one piece at a time, so that you’re able to monitor any nega-
tive changes in her stools (diarrhea). A good rule is to try a new food for 
three days before adding another to the mix.
Hay Every Day Keeps the Doctor Away
Knowing the general rules of rabbit nutrition is a good start, but the details 
are most important. To keep your rabbit healthy, you need to provide the 
right blend of fresh foods and fiber.
When you look at the rabbit’s gastrointestinal tract (see Chapter 2), you can 
see that having a high-fiber diet makes everything move more smoothly; fiber 
is essential in producing cecotropes, which are the nutrient-rich droppings your 
rabbit needs to eat. The good news is you can provide fiber easily by feeding 
grass hay. In fact, being the grazers they are, rabbits should have grass hay 
available to them all the time. You can put it in a hay rack (see Chapter 5) 
or in a box inside the cage or exercise area. When the supply runs low, keep 
replacing it.
 
In addition to the fiber, grass hays are rich in other essential nutrients. Several 
types of grass hay exist: timothy, oat, brome, Bermuda, and mixed orchard 
grass. Any is fine. In fact, mixing them is a gourmet treat. Alfalfa, though, is one 
type of hay to avoid using; it’s too high in calories and protein.

95
 Chapter 6: Stocking Up on Carrots
 
You can purchase hay at a pet store or feed store. Make sure that the hay 
smells fresh and isn’t damp or moldy. Some stores leave hay sitting for a long 
time, so find out how long it’s been around (the fresher, the better). Try to 
buy only as much as you’ll use for about a two-month period and keep it dry. 
Store hay in a dry location out of the sun, in a container that is not air-tight (so 
no garbage cans). Don’t store hay in sealed plastic bags; sealing in hay’s natu-
ral moisture content can cause mold to grow.
When purchasing hay, look for the grass hays, which are light brown-green 
and grass-like. Alfalfa hay, which should only be fed to bunnies younger than 
six months, is dark green with more tough stems. Grass hay isn’t readily 
available in some areas, but you can order it online. The Appendix gives Web 
sites worth checking out in this arena.
Depending on the availability of hay where you live, you may be offered a 
choice between first- and second-cut hay. Be prepared with the facts:
 
✓ First-cut hay: Tends to be coarser and stalky, like straw. This high-fiber 
cut is better for your bunny, but not as tasty as some rabbits would like.
 
✓ Second cut hay: Dark green, finer, and more grass-like than first-cut hay. 
This cut is lower in fiber, which makes it the second choice as far as 
nutrition. Rabbits, like humans, make many of their food choices based 
on taste, not nutrition (like choosing the chocolate chip muffin over the 
bran muffin); as far as taste goes, second-cut would be voted “best 
tasting” by many rabbits.
Sticking to first-cut timothy hay is probably the best choice for your bunny’s 
health, but some rabbit’s will outright refuse the stuff. In this case, less fiber is 
better than no fiber, just as long as your finicky bunny has hay for munching.
 
For those of you with allergies, use timothy hay cubes (avoid alfalfa hay cubes). 
Although loose hay is preferred, these compressed cubes are the next best thing. 
(Processed cubes have fiber but in short lengths, which aren’t as effective in the 
rabbit gut as loose hay). If your rabbit eats cubes instead of loose hay, getting 
a high-fiber pelleted food is especially important. (See the upcoming section 
“Making the Most of Pellets.”) If you can’t find timothy hay cubes in your area, 
you can get them from Web sites listed in the Appendix.
Wild rabbits eat plenty of fresh foods and your domestic rabbit should, too. 
Greens and fruit aren’t only important to your rabbit’s health, but they’re 
also tasty treats that he’ll undoubtedly enjoy.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Going Green
Green vegetables, particularly the leafy type, are the most important fresh 
food for your rabbit, and he should have at least three kinds on a daily basis. 
Root veggies are also good. On a daily basis, give your rabbit at least 1 cup of 
greens for every 3 pounds of weight.
For example, a 6 pound rabbit should get 2 cups of greens every day.
When adding new veggies to your rabbit’s diet, do so gradually, one at a time, 
so you can keep track of which, if any, don’t agree with your rabbit’s tummy 
(soft stools or diarrhea). Most rabbit veterinarians suggest varying the veg-
etables offered, though they stress the point that at least three kinds be given 
each day. Choose from the following:
 
✓ Alfalfa sprouts
 
✓ Basil
 
✓ Beet greens
 
✓ Bok Choy
 
✓ Broccoli
 
✓ Brussels sprouts
 
✓ Carrot tops (with some carrots, for good measure)
 
✓ Celery
 
✓ Chard
 
✓ Chicory
 
✓ Cilantro
 
✓ Clover (too much can cause soft stools, so feed in moderation)
 
✓ Collard greens
 
✓ Dandelion flowers and greens (without pesticides)
 
✓ Endive
 
✓ Green peppers
 
✓ Kale
 
✓ Lettuce, dark leaf (romaine is best; iceberg lettuce is low in nutrients)
 
✓ Mint
 
✓ Mustard greens
 
✓ Parsley

97
 Chapter 6: Stocking Up on Carrots
 
✓ Pea pods (the flat, green edible kind)
 
✓ Radish tops
 
✓ Spinach
 
✓ Watercress
 
✓ Wheat grass
You can offer your rabbit other green leafy vegetables, too, to see whether 
she likes them. Remember that rabbits are all individuals, and you may find 
that your rabbit doesn’t like some greens but particularly enjoys others. If 
you’re not sure whether a plant is safe for your rabbit, take a look at the list 
of plants in Chapter 8 (or specific parts of plants) that rabbits should not eat. 
 
Before you feed greens to your rabbit, wash them thoroughly and check for 
any rotten areas. Be sure to cut off those areas before offering the greens to your 
pet, or better yet, skip these rotted greens altogether. You can buy chopped 
and cleaned bags of mixed greens sold for people salad, but please — no salad 
dressing! When available, organic fresh foods are even better.
Getting Fruity
Those who know and love bunnies can attest to the fact that many of them 
have a serious sweet tooth. Unfortunately, even the natural sugars in fruit 
can mean trouble for both rabbits and humans. Your best bet is to offer the 
following fruity delights sparingly and only as treats. (Sparingly means in 
tablespoons, not cups!)
 
✓ Apples (no seeds, please; they’re toxic)
 
✓ Berries, such as strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries
 
✓ Peaches, pears, and plums
 
✓ Papayas
 
✓ Melons, such as watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew
 
✓ Orange slices (peeled)
Bananas, grapes, and raisins are especially sweet. Think of them as the “lolli-
pops” of your bunny’s diet — only on rare occasions. (The upcoming section 
“Giving Your Bunny Treats” discusses treats and portions in more detail.) As 
with all fresh produce, be sure to wash fruit thoroughly.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Making the Most of Pellets
 
For years, pet rabbit owners have been giving their bunnies alfalfa-based, 
commercially produced rabbit pellets. These high-calorie nuggets of ground-
up hay, grain, vitamins, and minerals were considered a staple in pet rabbit 
diets for a long time. The result, according to many rabbit experts, has been a 
plethora of obese and unhealthy pet bunnies (see Figure 6-1).
 
Readily available, alfalfa-based pellets are convenient, but newer information 
suggests that pellets aren’t optimal for pet rabbits that are not growing or pro-
ducing baby rabbits. Therefore, the latest recommendations for the pet rabbit 
are that any pellets you use should be timothy-based, and not alfalfa-based. 
Choose kinds that have 20 percent or greater fiber content.
Picking pellets
Not all pellets are created equal. If you want a healthy, long-lived pet, search 
around for grass hay-based pellets, most of which are made from timothy. A 
few companies make this product, including Oxbow Animal Health, which is 
mentioned in the Appendix. You can also opt to leave pellets out of your 
rabbit’s diet, as long as you provide a constant supply of grass hay and 
plenty of fresh foods. (Talk to your vet about specific amounts.)
Growing a garden
Rabbits love nothing more than to graze natu-
rally. If you have a green thumb and want to 
give your rabbit a truly natural way for him to 
take in his daily nutrients, grow a bunny garden. 
Set aside a patch of your backyard and plant 
the seeds of some of the plants listed as good 
greens in this chapter. (Mint, parsley, basil, and 
leaf lettuces are easy to grow.) Use organic soil 
and avoid using pesticides or herbicides. When 
the plants mature, create a protective enclosure 
for your rabbit all around the garden and let him 
run loose among the plants daily, if possible.
Consider, too, that lawn grasses are similar to 
the different varieties of grass hay, just never 
allowed to mature. Left unmowed, a section 
of lawn grass becomes a veritable snacking 
meadow for rabbits. Be certain, of course, to 
ensure that the area is not treated with pesti-
cides and is carefully supervised and protected 
from predators.
If you don’t have a yard for planting, don’t fret. 
Use a large tray that you can keep on your bal-
cony, fire escape, or window sill as your garden. 
Try to find a south-facing area or any area that 
gets plenty of direct sun. Once your plants have 
grown to maturity in the tray, give your rabbit 
access to it for a while so that he can enjoy the 
fruits (and veggies) of your labor.

When shopping for timothy-based pellets, you’ll notice that the larger bags of 
feed are the better deal, money-wise. But don’t be tempted to buy a huge bag 
that lasts for six months because the pellets will lose their nutritional value 
over time. Buy only what your rabbit can consume in a month’s time and keep 
them out of sunlight in a cool, dry place to prevent mold. Like hay, pellets 
should be stored in a container that is not air-tight but that will keep out bugs 
and other pests.
Determining the correct amount of pellets
 
The amount of pellets that your rabbit should eat depends on a few factors:
 
✓ Babies (less than 3 months): Up until 7 weeks of age, kits rely on their 
mother’s milk for most of their nutritional needs. Access to alfalfa hay 
(which is okay for growing babies) and pellets should begin around 4 
weeks. Try to avoid feeding alfalfa-based pellets to babies because it 
may make it more difficult to change them over to timothy-based pellets 
as adults. Wait until about 12 weeks to start introducing veggies, one at 
a time, in very small quantities (half an ounce).

100
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
✓ Adolescents (5 to 12 months): Up until 7 months, offer unlimited pellets 
and hay, making the transition from alfalfa to grass hay. Continue to 
introduce more vegetables and greens. At around 7 months, decrease 
pellets to ½ cup per 6 pounds of rabbit. Consider introducing a small 
amount of fruit as a treat (less than 2 ounces per 6 pounds of rabbit).
 
✓ Adult (1 year and older): The amount of pellets you give your rabbit 
depends primarily on your rabbit’s weight, his health, and what other 
foods he eats. Continue to offer unlimited grass and slowly increase veg-
gies up to at least 2 cups per 6 pounds of body weight. For rabbits that 
get all the grass hay they want and fresh greens daily, ¼ cup to ½ cup 
of timothy pellets per 6 pounds of rabbit is a maximum. Decrease the 
amount of pellets if weight gain becomes an issue.
 
✓ Seniors (6 years and older): Unless the older rabbit has problems with 
weight, you can continue a normal adult diet.
 
✓ Ill or underweight: If your rabbit is underweight or suffering from an 
illness that prevents him from eating hay and green foods, your veteri-
narian may recommend that you increase the amount of pellets. In some 
situations, the concentrated nutrients in the pellets may be beneficial 
to regaining strength, particularly after a disease that causes unhealthy 
weight loss. In these cases, please follow your veterinarian’s recommen-
dations. (Chapter 9 talks more about illnesses and their signs.)
 
✓ Overweight rabbits: In many cases, problems with weight result from 
overfeeding of pellets. (See this chapter’s “Coping with a chubby bunny” 
for more information.)
 
✓ Households with hay allergies: If you or some other person have 
hay allergies, you may have to leave loose hay out of the diet and rely on 
compressed hay cubes. In that case, continue feeding fresh foods as 
suggested, but offer the amount of timothy pellets in the amount recom-
mended on the food bag for your pet’s weight; modify as needed.
If your rabbit doesn’t finish the pellets you provide him in a serving, throw 
them out before doling out the next serving. Don’t pour the new pellets on 
top of the old ones and don’t forget to wash out the bowl on a regular basis 
to reduce the likelihood of bacteria or mold.
 
One advantage of monitoring the amount of food your rabbit eats is that 
you’re better able to notice when your rabbit’s appetite decreases, which can 
often be a sign of illness. Catching problems early can make a big difference in 
diagnosing and treating health problems.
Our understanding of rabbit nutrition has changed a lot over the years. 
Rabbits meant for the meat and fur industry were fed pellets with high alfalfa 
and grain contents to maximize meat production and luxurious fur. Many 
breeders and rabbit show participants still feed rabbits this way and may 
advise you to do so, too. However, most nutritionists and veterinarians 

101
 Chapter 6: Stocking Up on Carrots
believe the track to good long-term health is to avoid alfalfa based foods 
(except for growing and pregnant rabbits) and eliminate grains altogether.
Coping with a Chubby Bunny
A common problem vets see in pet rabbits is obesity. Rabbits who eat too 
many pellets and don’t get enough exercise become dangerously overweight. 
(Refer to Figure 6-1 to see an obese rabbit). If your rabbit needs to slim down, 
you can help him by reducing his pellet intake or removing pellets altogether 
as long as he eats hay and greens instead. Restrict his diet to 1⁄8 to ¼ cup of 
pellets for every 5 pounds of body weight. You can still give him treats but 
limit them to greens only. He can have as much grass hay as he wants, but 
certainly stick to timothy hay, rather than the higher-calorie alfalfa hay.
 
Not sure how much your rabbit weighs? And you can’t get him to sit still on 
the bathroom scale? Simply stand on your scale and make note of your weight. 
Then pick up your rabbit and get back on the scale while holding your pet. 
Make note of the new total weight. Finally, subtract your weight alone from the 
weight of you holding the rabbit. This number is your rabbit’s weight.
Giving Your Bunny Treats
You can feed the food in one sitting or throughout the day while training 
(Chapter 12, which covers training, offers tips on using treats as training 
rewards). With that in mind, some treats your rabbit may enjoy include
 
✓ Apple slices without seeds
 
✓ Cantaloupe
 
✓ Honeydew
 
✓ Kiwi
 
✓ Nectarines
 
✓ Peaches
 
✓ Pears
 
✓ Plums
 
✓ Strawberries
 
✓ Tomatoes (but not the vines or leaves — yes, tomatoes are fruit)
 
✓ Watermelon

102
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Think outside the box when it comes to treats, especially if you’re watching 
your bunny’s figure. Dried apple twigs and branches are a much appreciated 
source of fun and fiber for rabbits. And don’t overlook the value of a good 
old-fashioned petting session as a reward.
Popping Pills
You may be wondering if you need to give your rabbit liquid or chewable 
vitamins and minerals in addition to her regular meal. If your pet is getting 
a balanced diet with grass hay and fresh foods at its core, you don’t need 
to provide vitamin or mineral supplements. The rabbit makes his very own 
nutritional supplements in the form of cecotropes (see Chapter 2).
The exceptions to this rule are when your rabbit is pregnant, nursing, recov-
ering from an illness, or undergoing extreme stress. In these situations, check 
with a veterinarian first to see whether you need to use supplements.
 
When it comes to vitamins and minerals, you can have too much of a good 
thing. Over-supplementing certain vitamins and minerals can cause toxicity or 
severe illness.
Remember that if you have a pet bunny, you don’t have to do much more 
than give her unlimited grass hay, plenty of fresh foods, limited amounts of 
high-quality pellets, and an ample supply of water. But if you have a female 
rabbit (doe) who is expecting a litter of baby rabbits (kits) or nursing her 
young, you need to do a bit more to get her safely through her pregnancy and 
nursing. Your veterinarian can offer guidance in such situations.
Forbidding Foods
Avoid foods high in carbohydrates (starches and sugars, for example). Many 
commercial treat foods contain high levels of starch and fat. Although a 
rabbit can eat small amounts without ill effect, he’ll start craving these foods. 
(Sound like a person?). Obesity and serious GI disease are just two of the 
resulting problems if his cravings are indulged. It’s always easier to prevent 
than to treat a disease.
 
Think it’s cute to feed your begging bunny some crackers, a nibble of your 
pasta, or a snack of cereal? Think again.

103
 Chapter 6: Stocking Up on Carrots
Please avoid these foods at all cost:
 
✓ Beans (any kind)
 
✓ Breads
 
✓ Cereals
 
✓ Chocolate
 
✓ Corn
 
✓ Nuts
 
✓ Oats
 
✓ Peas
 
✓ Potatoes
 
✓ Refined sugar
 
✓ Seeds
 
✓ Wheat (and any other grains)
 
Don’t let your bunny munch out of the cat or dog food bowl. Cat and dog food 
are much too high in protein and carbohydrates for your rabbit. If he eats too 
much of these foods, the results can be fatal.

Big Ears and More
In This Chapter

▶ Going through the list of grooming possibilities
▶ Brushing out loose hair
▶ Cutting nails and cleaning ears
M
uch like cats, rabbits are fastidious about their own bodies. They’re 
constantly grooming themselves, making sure that every little hair is 
perfectly in place. For that reason, shorthaired rabbits seldom need our help 
in the grooming department. However, weekly grooming is still a great idea 
because it
 
✓ Encourages social bonding with your pet
 
✓ Encourages a thorough examination to help detect abnormalities
 
✓ Reduces the amount of hair shed into the environment and into your 
house
Unlike cats, however, rabbits aren’t able to cope with (by vomiting) the 
excess hair that accumulate in their systems, leaving them prone to serious 
digestive issues. Fortunately, a weekly brushing is usually all it takes for your 
bunny to stay on the right track.
Cleaning your rabbit’s cage regularly can also help your rabbit stay clean 
and healthy. A clean cage translates into a clean rabbit. Despite their self-
grooming skill, however, rabbits need a little help from their human friends in 
this regard. As a bunny owner, you should provide regular grooming for your 
pet. This chapter shows you how to keep your rabbit’s cage and coat in tip-top 
shape.

106
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Stocking Your Grooming Toolshed
Grooming your rabbit includes brushing, combing, clipping toenails, and 
examining your pet’s entire body to make sure that all is as it should be. The 
grooming process will probably take about an hour a week, depending on 
your rabbit’s coat. (Longer coats require more care.)
To properly groom your rabbit, you need the right tools at your disposal.
 
✓ Pin brush: A small pin brush, made for cat grooming, works great for 
rabbits. Pin brushes are made up of straight metal pins attached to a 
rubber base, and they’re great at trapping loose hair within the coat. Pin 
brushes cost anywhere from a couple of dollars to $8, depending on the 
quality of the brush and where you live. The less expensive brushes do 
the job well, so don’t feel compelled to spend a lot.
 
✓ Flea comb: A regular-size flea comb is a good tool. (Chapter 3 helps you 
determine which breed has short and which has long hair.) A flea comb 
smoothes out the coat, traps loose hairs, and helps you find out whether 
fleas are a problem for your rabbit. Flea combs trap fleas in their metal 
teeth. They also lift flea feces from the coat, which is an indicator that 
fleas are present. They’re also good for removing mats (tangle of hair, 
often with undercoat) from all types of rabbit coats. (See “Running Down 
the Grooming Checklist,” later in this chapter, for more about checking 
for fleas.) Flea combs usually don’t cost more than $3.
 
✓ Wide-tooth comb: Useful on rabbits with long coats, wide-tooth pet 
combs separate the hairs and prevent matting. You can use this tool 
after using the pin brush.
 
✓ Bristle brush: After you brush and comb your rabbit’s coat, the bristle 
brush works as a finishing tool. Bristle brushes have soft nylon or hair 
bristles, and you can use them to give the coat a once over after you 
use the pin brush. The bristle brush picks up any remaining loose hairs 
and leaves your rabbit with a shiny coat, which is especially important if 
you’re grooming your rabbit for a show.
 
✓ Mat splitter or mat rake: Use these specially designed bladed tools on 
longhaired rabbits when mats are too severe to be removed by brushing 
or combing.
 
✓ Toenail clippers: Guillotine-type nail clippers designed for small dogs 
and cats work best on rabbit toenails. These clippers are small and 
sharp and are less likely to split the nail than a human nail clipper.
 
✓ Flashlight: For those who have bunnies with dark nails, a small flashlight 
will help you see where to clip nails.

107
 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
 
✓ Styptic powder: In case a nail is cut too short, styptic powder tends to 
halt bleeding. It has an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. Although styptic 
powder is the preferred astringent, you can use flour or cornstarch in 
a pinch. What may work best is plain old direct pressure — simply put 
some pressure on the nail bed with a clean cloth for 1 to 2 minutes.
 
✓ Cotton swabs: Soft cotton-tipped swabs are handy for ears and eyes that 
may need tending; also good for applying styptic powder to nails.
You can purchase these items at a pet-supply store, through a mail-order 
catalog, or over the Internet. The Appendix lists several helpful resources.
Handling with Care
Rabbits are incredibly cute, and everyone wants to hold them. The problem 
is that most rabbits aren’t terribly thrilled about being held. Can you blame 
them? Their primary means of defense is being able to run away when they’re 
in danger. When all four of their feet are suspended off the ground, they have 
no way to escape should something scare them. Further, when a predator 
captures a rabbit in the wild, that predator picks the rabbit up and carries it 
off. Given this reality, it’s not hard to understand why being lifted and carried 
may be a scary sensation for a rabbit.
Taking proper precautions
As a child, Audrey volunteered to be a rabbit car-
rier at her local 4-H club rabbit show. The rab-
bits flailed their paws against her as she carried 
them from their cages to the judge’s podium. By 
the end of the day, her stomach was completely 
covered with scratches. Rabbit toenails can be 
sharp, and when a bunny becomes insecure 
and starts to struggle, human skin usually pays 
the price. To prevent your stomach and arms 
from being torn to bits when you handle your 
rabbit, take the following precautions:
 ✓ Trim your rabbit’s nails. If you keep your 
rabbit’s toenails trimmed, you’re less likely 
to be scratched should your pet struggle 
when you’re carrying him.
 ✓ Train your rabbit. By slowly acclimat-
ing your rabbit to the sensation of being 
carried, you reduce the likelihood that he’ll 
start to flail when you’re holding him.
 ✓ Wear safe clothes. Never carry a rabbit 
while your arms or torso is uncovered. If 
your rabbit panics, you’ll find out first hand 
just how painful rabbit scratches can be.
 ✓ Monitor children. Kids love to carry their 
bunnies, but if they don’t do it right, they 
can end up covered in scratches. Rabbits 
have powerful hind legs, and the scratches 
that result from kicking while being held 
can be deep and painful. Prevent younger 
kids from carrying rabbits (especially large 
ones), and teach older kids the proper way 
to do it.

108
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
So does that mean that you can never pick up your rabbit? Of course not 
(although you should only carry him when you need to move him from one 
place to another). But it does mean that you need to use patience, sensitivity, 
and the right handling techniques to reduce or eliminate fear in your rabbit.
Before you attempt to start carrying your rabbit around, you need to gain 
your pet’s trust. If your rabbit is a baby, you’re in luck. If you start the han-
dling process when your rabbit is young, your pet can grow up to be more 
comfortable being handled. If you have an adult rabbit that you’re just getting 
to know, you need to do a bit more work to win your bunny’s trust, especially 
if your new pet was mishandled in the past.
Building trust is a time commitment, but taking 15 minutes a day to work 
through the following numbered steps may speed the process. (This chap-
ter’s “Need a lift?” sidebar offers an alternative method.)
 
1. Sit on the floor with your rabbit or place your rabbit on a table.
 
 Cover the table with a blanket to protect its surface and to secure the 
rabbit’s footing.
 
2. Get him used to the feel of your hands.
 
 Pet your rabbit and talk to him while you do it. Then try giving him some 
treats. (See Chapter 6 for more on feeding treats.)
 
 Continue to pet your rabbit until you see that he’s starting to trust you. 
(See Chapter 11 for information about how to read your rabbit’s body 
language.) Signs of trust are when your rabbit
 
• Approaches you on his own for touching (anytime)
 
• Puts his paws on you
 
• Shows relaxed body language during these 15-minute sessions
 
3. Place your rabbit against your body.
 
 While the bunny is on the table or on the floor, gently move him toward 
you. Keeping his feet on the ground, restrain him against your chest or 
legs. If you want, you can gently hold him by the scruff (the loose skin 
on the back of his neck) with one hand while pressing his hindquarters 
against you with the other hand.
 
 Your rabbit may struggle at first if she isn’t used to being restrained. Use 
a calm voice and patience to show her that she’s safe despite the fact 
that you’re restraining her. If your rabbit starts to panic and struggles 
wildly, let him go. Start over again with the trust-building sessions until 
he seems comfortable with your touch and then try the gentle restraint 
again. After your bunny seems comfortable being gently restrained 
against your body, you can get him used to being lifted.

109
 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
 
4. Slowly place one hand under your pet’s chest, just behind its front legs.
 
 Make sure that you’re in a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. 
Work from the table or floor area where you’ve been conducting your 
trust-building sessions because your rabbit feels safe here.
 
5. Slide your other hand underneath the rabbit’s rump to lift him.
 
 Always support the hind quarters to prevent injury to the spine. The 
most common injury is due to improper handling.
 
6. Lift upward with the hand that’s on the rabbit’s chest and support the 
rabbit’s body weight with the other hand.
 
7. Pull the rabbit’s body toward you as you lift, pointing the rabbit’s 
head toward the back of your elbow.
 
8. Slide your hand out from under the rabbit’s chest as you press his 
forequarters against your side.
 
 The idea is to carry the rabbit under your arm as you would carry a foot-
ball, as shown in Figure 7-1.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
 If your rabbit begins to struggle, hold him more securely against you. If 
he starts flailing, place him gently back on the table or the floor. Don’t 
drop your rabbit; you can seriously injure him.
 
 After your rabbit is comfortable with you, hold him this way for several 
minutes and increase the time that you spend handling him.
 
9. When you can comfortably hold him in this position for at least 5 min-
utes, you can start moving around with him tucked under your arm.
 
 Be prepared — your rabbit may get scared when he feels you moving. If 
he starts to struggle, stop and let him get comfortable again before you 
begin to walk again.
 
Your veterinarian may have cause to place your rabbit on his back for exami-
nation of some kind, but please avoid putting your rabbit in this position 
unless it’s absolutely necessary. Rabbits may become extremely frightened 
when they’re placed on their backs and restrained. They may cease to strug-
gle, but the current thinking is that’s only out of terror, not relaxation. Try to 
work with your rabbit by keeping his feet on solid ground. She’ll appreciate 
you for it!
Running Down the Grooming Checklist
Grooming sessions provide an opportunity to examine your rabbit thor-
oughly for certain health problems. Catching these problems early increases 
the likelihood of being able to cure your pet. Chapters 9 and 10 tell you more 
about these diseases and what to look for.
 
When going over your bunny with a brush, make sure that you mentally run 
through this grooming checklist:
 
✓ Look for parasites. Rabbits are just as susceptible to these pests as dogs 
and cats are, especially if they live or play outdoors. When grooming, keep 
an eye out for fleas and ticks. Ticks appear as dark round protrusions 
about 1⁄8 to 1/4 inch. Fleas are small, dark, and difficult to see. However, 
their feces (flea dirt) are readily visible, especially on a light-colored 
rabbit. They appear as small, dark flecks on the skin along the rabbit’s 
back, neck, and especially rump. If you find parasites on your pet, con-
tact your vet for information on how to safely rid your rabbit of these 
pests. Your vet can provide you with rabbit-safe products that can do 
the job. (You can find more parasite and vet talk in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Seek out lumps and sores. As you go over your rabbit with a brush or 
comb, look out for any lumps or open sores on your pet’s body. (The 
more familiar you become with your rabbit’s body, the more you’ll be 
able to notice such problems.) Lumps shouldn’t be ignored. Scabs, 
sores, and crusty areas can be a sign of parasites or a bacterial infection. 

111
 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
Sores on the feet and hocks can be the result of a damp or dirty environ-
ment and improper flooring.
 
✓ Check eyes, ears, and teeth. Examine your rabbit’s eyes up close to 
make sure that no discharge or swelling is present. Ears should be 
looked at for signs of parasites or bacterial infection, especially in lop-
eared breeds (see Chapter 3). There’s more ear talk in this chapter’s 
“Cleaning Your Bunny’s Ears.” Teeth? Be sure your bunny’s chompers 
are on the straight and narrow (see Chapter 9).
 
✓ Feel along the jaw line for any lumps. The sides should be symmetrical. 
Any obvious lumps or lack of symmetry should be examined by a vet.
Bypassing the Bath
Unlike dogs, rabbits don’t need regular bathing. In fact, you’re better off not 
bathing a rabbit at all. The bath stresses them terribly and exposes them to 
injury because they’ll struggle. In short, skip the bath.
If your rabbit needs help keeping clean on occasion, you can do some spot 
cleaning. If your bunny stepped in something sticky or irritating to the skin, 
remove it right away. Pet-supply stores sell waterless shampoos, which you 
can spray directly onto your pet’s coat. Simply saturate the area with the 
waterless shampoo product and follow the directions on the label.
Need a lift?
The best type of lift for a rabbit is one that 
makes him feel secure. You may choose to use 
a lift described in this chapter or a modified ver-
sion of either — as long as it’s safe for you and 
your rabbit.
 1. Kneel down and slide one hand down the 
rabbit’s side while petting her head with 
your other hand.
 2. Slide the arm at your rabbit’s side under 
his chest and move your petting hand down 
under to support his hindquarters, as in this 
figure.
 3. Scoop him closely to you and hold firmly, 
not tightly. Be certain to support your 
rabbit’s hind end and keep him from slip-
ping out of your arms.
 4. Stand up slowly, keeping your rabbit close 
to you.
 
 Hug the rabbit if he starts to struggle. 
Don’t drop him, especially from a standing 
position.
 5. To put your rabbit down, old him close until 
you’re back in a kneeling position and then 
carefully let him go on the floor.
All of this will take time and practice. Consider 
a small treat to reward your rabbit and help her 
relax a bit when you put her down.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
When you’re dealing with a slightly soiled bunny, a dry bath approach is best 
whenever possible. Use a cornstarch-based baby powder that doesn’t con-
tain talc (which has been linked to cancer). Place the bunny in your lap on a 
bunched towel so that he feels secure and apply the cornstarch to the soiled 
areas, working the powder into the fur. As the cornstarch coats the soiled 
areas, you can gently brush away the debris. 
Your bunny’s hind end may become extremely soiled or wet if he develops 
soft stools or is wet with urine. Your vet should diagnose the cause of this 
problem, but it’s up to you to clean your rabbit and protect his sensitive skin. 
In these cases, a dry bath may not be sufficient. Follow these steps to prop-
erly wash your bun’s bottom:
 
1. Fill two containers or a double sink with 2 to 3 inches of lukewarm 
water.
 
2. Dip the rabbit’s rear end in the water.
 
 Do not submerge the entire rabbit!
 
3. Use a wash cloth, soft brush, or your hand to loosen the material.
 
4. Take the rabbit out of the water, apply a very small amount of sham-
poo (suitable for cats; don’t use baby shampoo), and thoroughly mas-
sage the area with your hands.
 
5. Dip him into the clean water of the other container and rinse off the 
soap and debris.
 
6. Towel dry him, getting as much water out as possible.
 
 Rabbits can quickly become hypothermic, so consider using a blow 
dryer on low, being sure not to burn his skin. Breeds with dense or plush 
coats may take longer to dry.
 
7. Put him in a cage (in a warm room) with towels to continue to absorb 
water.
 
 He’ll finish grooming himself.
If you need to repeat or rinse more, you can let the rabbit take a break on 
some towels, change the water, and rinse again.
Removing matted feces and urine can be incredibly difficult if it has accumu-
lated, causing the skin underneath to become very sore and irritated. In fact, 
the skin may even tear if you try too hard to remove this material. You may 
need to have a veterinarian give your sedated rabbit a thorough cleaning. 
You can ask the vet to clip the hair at this time so that future cleaning won’t 
be as difficult. If in doubt, have a vet check it out! In many cases like this, a 
vet is a better choice than a groomer, who may not be experienced in the 
finer points of rabbit care.

 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
Breaking Out the Brush
Rabbits are good at brushing their own coats and using their tongues to 
clean their fur and smooth it down. Rabbits left to do their own grooming are 
also notorious for leaving loose hairs around. If you have an indoor rabbit 
who hops around the carpet and on the furniture, shedding will become a 
nuisance.
The way to help remedy this loose hair situation is to brush your rabbit regu-
larly. Brushing reduces the loose fur around the house, helps prevent intesti-
nal blockages caused by ingested hair, and also gives you an opportunity to 
examine your pet closely for lumps, bumps, and other health problems. (See 
Chapter 9 for more on health issues.) Grooming time also provides a great 
opportunity for bonding with your pet.
 
You want to make grooming a pleasant experience for your rabbit, so brush your 
pet gently to avoid causing him any discomfort or pain. Rabbits have sensitive 
skin, and your bunny will come to dislike grooming time if you’re too rough 
with him. Likewise, when you handle your rabbit for toenail clipping or any 
other grooming procedure, be patient and gentle.
Brushing short to medium coats
If your rabbit has a short to medium coat typical of most rabbit breeds, you 
need to set aside an hour a week for grooming.
 
Rex rabbit breeds have ultra short coats, so you need to take extra care when 
you brush him because you don’t want to damage the skin. Rex rabbits, in 
fact, need very infrequent brushing.
To brush a short to medium coat rabbit:
 
1. Find a comfortable place to sit while grooming your pet.
 
2. Assemble your grooming tools within reach.
 
 See the section “Stocking Your Grooming Toolshed,” earlier in this 
chapter.
 
3. Hold your bunny securely in your lap.
 
 Stabilizing your bunny against your body will help prevent him from 
struggling and hurting himself.
 
4. Brush your rabbit with the pin brush, moving in the direction that the 
coat grows to minimize breakage of the hair.

114
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
 If you notice many loose hairs in your brush after a few swipes on his 
coat and it’s spring or fall, your rabbit may be molting. (See the “A time 
to shed, a time to brush” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
 
 Don’t brush his face, feet, ears, or tail. Stay away from these areas 
because they don’t have a lot of hair. When brushing your rabbit, be 
sure to be gentle and talk to your pet in a quiet voice to reassure him. 
If he’s reluctant to be brushed, try offering him some healthy treats to 
nibble on while you’re brushing. The treats will distract him and help 
him associate grooming time with something pleasant.
 
5. Go through your rabbit’s coat with your flea comb.
 
 Check for fleas that may get caught in the comb. Check also for black 
specs on the teeth of the comb, which may be flea feces. If you’re 
unsure, place these specs on a paper towel and place a drop of water 
on them. If the wet area of the towel turns red, your rabbit has fleas. If 
you’re still not certain if your rabbit has fleas, ask your veterinarian to 
make a diagnosis.
 
6. Comb out any hair matting.
 
 Flea combs work well for this task.
 
7. Give your rabbit the once over with the bristle brush if you have one.
 
 This brush picks up any loose hairs you missed and helps give the coat 
a nice shine.
Brushing long coats
If you have an Angora, Jersey Wooley, or other longhair rabbit breed (see 
Chapter 3), you need to brush your pet on a daily basis, regardless of the 
season. These rabbits are extremely prone to hair matting. The hair is not 
only long but fine textured.
To brush a longhaired rabbit:
 
1. Find a comfortable place to sit while you’re grooming your pet.
 
2. Assemble your grooming tools within reach.
 
 See “Stocking Your Grooming Toolshed.”
 
3. Situate your rabbit comfortably in your lap.
 
4. Start with your pin brush.

115
 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
 
5. Part sections of your rabbit’s coat and brush from the area where the 
hair attaches to the skin outward, in the direction the hair is growing.
 
 Be sure to loosen any areas that appear to be matting. If you do this every 
day, you’ll eventually weed out all the mats, and your rabbit’s coat won’t 
have a problem. Flea combs can be great for getting out mats if you have 
enough space between the mat and the skin to get the comb started.
 
6. Move on to the wide-tooth comb and bristle brush.
 
 Gently comb in the direction that hair grows with both of these tools. 
Start with the wide-tooth comb and finish up with the bristle brush. 
Then move on to ear cleaning and toenail clipping.
 
If you aren’t comfortable caring for your longhair rabbit’s coat yourself or 
simply don’t have time, you can take your rabbit to a professional groomer 
for grooming or shearing. Make certain that the groomer you go to regularly 
works on rabbits, because these delicate creatures need special handling to 
prevent them from getting injured during the grooming process.
Another option is to trim your longhair rabbit’s fur yourself. Using a pair of 
sharp scissors, you can cut the hair back to a couple of inches in length so 
that it’s easier to maintain (and easier on your bunny’s tummy!). Don’t cut 
your rabbit’s fur all the way to the skin. Not only is this dangerous because 
you may accidentally cut your rabbit, but your rabbit does need to have 
some fur on his body. His coat acts as a natural insulator against heat and 
cold.
 
If you come across mats in your rabbit’s fur, you can use a mat splitter or mat 
rake to gently break up the mats. Don’t use scissors for this task because you 
risk snipping down to the skin. First try to remove matted fur with a flea comb 
or fine-toothed comb. Don’t pull up on your rabbit’s fur as you work on the 
mat because your rabbit’s skin is very fragile. If the mats are severe, get help 
from your veterinarian. (A groomer is not likely to be skilled in the finer points 
of bunny grooming.)
Clipping It Not Quite in the Bud
Rabbit toenails grow constantly, just like human fingernails, and so they need 
to be clipped regularly (about every 6 to 8 weeks). If you don’t clip your rab-
bit’s toenails, they’ll become excessively long, and your pet will soon have 
trouble walking. He’ll also be in danger of catching a long toenail on his cage 
wire or on your carpet and may possibly tear the nail right out of his paw.

116
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Another good reason to keep your rabbit’s nails trimmed is for your own pro-
tection. Whenever you handle your rabbit, you come into contact with those 
nails. Should your pet become insecure and start to kick and struggle, long 
nails may do a good amount of damage to your skin. (The section “Handling 
with Care” in this chapter provides details on the proper way to handle 
your rabbit.)
 
You can tell whether your rabbit’s nails are too long because the nails extend 
beyond the edge of the fur on the rabbit’s foot. If you’re not sure, have your 
veterinarian take a look at your bunny’s feet to let you know whether he needs 
a trim.
The good news is that you don’t need to clip your rabbit’s toenails every 
time you groom him. Simply evaluate the length of the nails whenever you sit 
down to groom him. If they’re starting to get long, then it’s time to get out the 
clippers.
 
Rabbits, like most pets, don’t enjoy having their nails trimmed, so it’s best for 
you to start clipping with the aid of another person. This helper, preferably 
an experienced person, is the one to hold your rabbit while you do the actual 
nail clipping. Sources for experienced people are rabbit breeders, other expe-
rienced rabbit owners (find through rabbit organizations), veterinary staff, pet 
stores, and groomers that care for rabbits.
To clip your rabbit’s nails:
 
1. Have your helper position the rabbit on her lap with the rabbit’s rear 
resting against the helper’s lower abdomen.
 
 Make sure that both you and the handler are wearing long-sleeved shirts 
of heavy material because the potential for getting scratched is high 
with this grooming procedure. The helper should have a secure grip on 
the bunny without hurting her.
A time to shed, a time to brush
Rabbits shed like dogs and cats and seem to 
drop their fur most often during spring and fall. 
However, because rabbits are indoors under 
all kinds of lighting and temperature conditions, 
they can shed all year round. During the heaviest 
shedding times, brush your rabbit more often, 
especially on the rump area where the most 
loose fur seems to accumulate. (Some people 
find that the hair comes out simply by pulling 
at it with their fingers.) Should your rabbit ever 
shed to the point where bald patches appear, 
contact your veterinarian. This loss of hair may 
be a sign of hormonal abnormalities, parasites, 
or a disease.

117
 Chapter 7: Cleaning Behind Those Great Big Ears and More
 
 If your bunny tends to struggle no matter what you do, try wrapping her 
in a towel first, gently exposing the nails you want to clip.
 
2. Gently grasp one of the rabbit’s front legs.
 
3. Turn the leg so the dewclaw (the nail on the inside of the foot) 
is visible.
 
4. Examine the nail to determine where the quick is.
 
 The quick is the vein that extends from the toe to nearly the tip of the nail. 
It appears as a dark line in the nail. You want to clip the part of the nail that 
does not contain the quick (about 1⁄8 inch before the quick), as cutting the 
quick makes the nail bleed. If you’re having trouble locating the quick or 
have a rabbit with black nails, get a flashlight and shine it through the 
backside of the nail toward you. The vein will become visible.
 
 In the event that you should accidentally cut into your rabbit’s vein, 
making the nail bleed, don’t panic. Just dab a bit of styptic powder 
(available at drug stores) onto the nail, and the bleeding will stop.
 
5. Cut the tip of the nail off, as shown in Figure 7-2, repeating for each of 
the five nails on each of the rabbit’s front feet.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Clipping 
should be 
painless for 
all parties 
involved. 
Mind that 
quick!
 
 
6. Relax for a while.
 
7. Have your helper hold the rabbit again, so you can start working on 
the hind nails.
 
 This time, your helper should grasp the rabbit in the way described 
earlier in this chapter and shown in Figure 7-1. This will make the back 
paws accessible to you. Make certain that your rabbit is comfortable in 
the position that she’s placed. Otherwise, she’ll struggle and make clip-
ping her nails impossible.

118
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
8. Proceed with the back nails in the same way that you did 
with the front.
 
 You may find that the back nails are a bit tougher to cut than the front 
because they’re thicker. So be prepared to use a little more force to clip 
those hind nails. It’s important to note that rear legs are more prone to 
fracture during struggling if you pull the hind leg sideways rather than 
straight back.
 
If clipping nails sounds too overwhelming to you as a first-time rabbit owner, 
you can always take your rabbit to the veterinarian, groomer, or experienced 
rabbit owner for nail clipping. Ask your vet to show you how to do the nail 
clipping so that you don’t have to have it done at the vet’s office, which can be 
a hassle and expensive, too.
Cleaning Your Bunny’s Ears
A rabbit’s ears are his great showpiece, so you want to help him keep them 
clean. You can check them for cleanliness during your bunny’s regular 
grooming time, as long as you’re checking the ears at least once a week. 
(Don’t worry; your lop ear won’t get hurt if you check him out because his 
ears are soft and floppy.)
 
Whenever you groom your rabbit, thoroughly check his ears for waxy build-
up, dirt, or a foul smell. If you see debris in your rabbit’s ears, gently lift it out 
with a cotton-tipped swab or cotton ball. You can also ask your veterinarian 
for a solution that you can use to wipe the ears clean. If wax buildup is a prob-
lem, be careful not to push the wax into the ear canal. Wax actually has a pro-
tective purpose, so don’t routinely remove it from a rabbit’s ears. And never 
stick cotton swabs down into the ear canal.
You should do fine managing minor cases of dirt and wax. However, redness 
or a crusty discharge in the ear can indicate an ear mite infestation (see 
Chapter 9), which means you should consult your veterinarian.

I
f you want to keep your rabbit healthy and happy, you need to provide her 
with a lifestyle that includes plenty of exercise. Depending on where you 
live, this exercise routine may include some time outdoors, which requires that 
you take care of some safety precautions. This chapter can help you find out 
the best way to safely provide your rabbit with opportunities to exercise — 
both in the comfort of your home “gym” or in the great outdoors.
Fitness Matters
Lack of exercise contributes to a long list of preventable health problems in 
domestic rabbits. By taking a look at the wild rabbit’s lifestyle, you can easily 
see how a companion rabbit’s health can suffer when he doesn’t get the 
exercise he needs.
Wild at heart
A wild rabbit may hop, jump, and skip through 
about 2 acres of land each day, looking for large 
amounts of high-fiber food (and, sometimes, 
mates). At times, he may have to escape from 
the grasp of predators and will use his powerful 
back legs to run and leap. This wild creature is 
not likely to thrive in a small cage, deprived of 
exercise and doomed to a life of boredom.

120
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Many health problems are linked to obesity, and they’re serious, chronic, and 
even fatal. The extra weight puts pressure on a rabbit’s heart and joints and 
can lead to a host of health issues. Such conditions can be painful, decrease a 
rabbit’s quality of life, and ultimately reduce a rabbit’s lifespan.
Here are some common problems caused by lack of exercise:
 
✓ Obesity: The two most common causes of bunny obesity are a diet too 
high in calories and lack of exercise. Just like humans, when a rabbit 
sits around all day eating, he isn’t going to burn many calories. Those 
extra pounds not only stress the cardiovascular system, but can result 
in inflammation of the foot and lack of energy. Excess weight can also 
cause the growth of folds of fat in the dewlap (roll of skin under the 
chin) or around the rectal area, which can interfere with healthy groom-
ing habits, leading to a soiled bunny and even skin disease. That excess 
weight can also prevent your bun from eating his nutrient-rich ceco-
tropes, resulting in nutritional deficiencies. You can start with a healthy 
diet, but a combination of diet and exercise is necessary to cure — or, 
better yet, prevent — obesity.
 
✓ Pododermatitis (sore hock): Although foot problems can develop because 
of damp flooring, an overweight rabbit is also prone to the inflammation 
and ulcerations associated with pododermatitis because the excessive 
weight results in wear on the footpads. On top of that, a chubby bunny 
may have trouble cleaning himself, leaving urine and stool on the hind-
quarters and feet, which can lead to inflammatory skin disease.
 
✓ Gastrointestinal and urinary function: A rabbit deprived of opportuni-
ties to exercise may develop problems maintaining normal elimination 
habits, which can lead to concentrated (“sludgy”) urine or gastrointes-
tinal shutdown. Rabbits that have an exercise routine will urinate and 
defecate frequently — a good thing for urinary and digestive systems.
 
✓ Poor bone density: Like humans, rabbits who don’t get enough exercise 
can develop osteoporosis, a thinning of the bone. A rabbit with osteopo-
rosis is likely to have a spine or other bones that can break easily when 
the rabbit is handled or jumps off a high surface. Doctors recommend 
that humans perform regular weight-bearing exercises to prevent osteo-
porosis. The same is true for your rabbit: Daily exercise is necessary to 
keep your rabbit’s bones healthy and strong.
 
✓ Poor muscle tone: If your rabbit doesn’t exercise, his muscles will be 
underdeveloped and weak, which can lead to a general inability to move 
properly. Think about your rabbit’s most important muscle — his heart. 
If his heart muscle is weak, he will be less able to tolerate stressful situ-
ations. If you take an out-of-shape rabbit with a weak heart, like those 
who sit in a cage day after day, and then let her out and force her to run 
around the room, she may faint — or even die of cardiac failure.

121
 Chapter 8: Making Fitness and Fresh Air Fun for Your Bunny
 
✓ Behavioral problems: The boredom that comes with being confined to 
a cage without exercise can be linked to a number of negative behaviors 
observed in rabbits: aggression, obsessive grooming, lethargy, and 
obsessive chewing (of the bars of the cage, for example). In many of 
these cases, a bit of freedom and exercise can provide the very outlet 
needed to improve and even eliminate those behaviors (see Chapter 13). 
The results: happier and healthier rabbits!
Keeping Your Rabbit Fit
Your bunny needs exercise and plenty of it. In fact, caged rabbits need at 
least three to four hours a day, every day, of free time outside the cage for 
exercise. You can satisfy this need indoors or out, as long as your rabbit has 
room and safe activities to keep her moving.
Some things to keep in mind as you focus on your bunny’s fitness plan:
 
✓ It’s best to offer exercise when a rabbit is naturally most active; for most 
house bunnies, this means early to mid-morning and/or late afternoon 
and evening.
 
✓ Try to be consistent with your rabbit’s exercise schedule so that you 
establish a routine (better for both of you!).
 
✓ Whether indoors or out, be sure to rabbit-proof the exercise area. (See 
Chapter 5 for indoor rabbit-proofing and this chapter’s “Rabbit-Proofing 
Your Yard” for outdoor precautions).
 
✓ Inspire your rabbit to move and play by giving her things to chew on, dig 
into, climb on, crawl under, and hop on and around. (See Chapter 14 for 
more on play tactics.)
Indoors
For those who can’t (or choose not to) take their rabbit’s fitness routine out-
doors, an indoor home gym or recreation room is a fine option.
After you designate which areas of your home will be accessible to your bunny 
and have securely rabbit-proofed these rooms (see Chapter 5) or set up 
a rabbit pen with moveable panels, you can give your rabbit permission to 
roam, under your supervision. When you first turn your bunny loose in “her” 
room, she’ll hop about and investigate for several days. She’ll scour the place 
and leave her scent on objects by rubbing her chin on them. (Don’t worry; the 
scent isn’t discernible to the human nose.) Eventually, though, the novelty of 

122
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
the new room wears off, and bunny gets bored. To encourage her to do more 
than just sit in a corner and stare at you, you need to get active.
 
Some tips on getting your bunny to exercise:
 
✓ Play with him. If you’ve bonded with your rabbit, you’ll be amazed at 
how easily he can learn to play with you. When playing with your rabbit, 
let the rabbit initiate the play. (See Chapter 14 for more details on play-
ing with your rabbit.)
 
✓ Teach him tricks. A rabbit isn’t going to fetch your slippers or rescue 
lost children, but you can show him some basic tricks and behaviors 
that result in food rewards. (See Chapter 12 for details on how to teach 
your rabbit tricks.)
 
✓ Give him toys. If your bunny needs motivation to exercise, now is the 
time to pull out those toys that you bought for your rabbit at the pet-
supply store. Toss him one toy at a time until you find the one that 
strikes his fancy. Don’t forget the homemade stuff, too. A cardboard box, 
a toilet paper roll, and even an empty plastic soda bottle can prove ter-
ribly exciting to your rabbit. (See Chapter 14 for information on toys for 
your rabbit.)
 
✓ Provide company. If you have more than one rabbit, and they all get 
along, put them together for exercise playtime. Not only can they get 
plenty of exercise, but you’ll also laugh your head off watching them. 
But make sure that you provide them with several “hide” areas (at least 
as many as the number of rabbits), such as simple overturned card-
board boxes with a hole cut in the side, in case a spat breaks out. If the 
rabbit has nowhere to hide or escape and another one is being aggres-
sive, a serious injury may result. (See Chapter 2 on the pros and cons of 
adopting multiple rabbits.)
Keep in mind that you should place your litter box somewhere in the area 
during these exercise sessions so that your rabbit can use it during playtime. 
If you have more than one rabbit, you may need to put at least as many litter 
boxes out as the number of rabbits.
Outdoors
Just because you have an indoor rabbit doesn’t mean that you can’t take him 
outside for exercise. Fresh-air fitness is a good idea if
 
✓ You have rabbit-friendly weather (not too hot, not too cold, and not 
too windy).
 
✓ You live in an area that has good air quality.

123
 Chapter 8: Making Fitness and Fresh Air Fun for Your Bunny
 
✓ You can provide an environment safe from predators and other threats 
(even theft).
 
✓ You can provide an area free from fertilizers and pesticides.
 
✓ Your rabbit seems to enjoy his outside time.
Fresh air is great for all creatures, including your bunny. Plus, you won’t 
need to do as much work to encourage your rabbit to exercise outdoors. The 
sights, sounds, and smells of the great outdoors can keep your rabbit busy.
Of course, just as with your indoor rabbit areas, your outdoor areas must be 
equipped with the basics of good rabbit-proofing, as shown in Figure 8-1.
Select an area where you plan to exercise your rabbit outdoors, and check 
it out for safety. For details on what this involves, see the upcoming section 
“Rabbit-Proofing Your Yard.”

124
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
No matter how safe your yard appears, do not leave your bunny out there to do 
his thing. You should stay with your bunny to be sure he’s not getting into mis-
chief and to make sure that he is safe in his outdoor environment — from the 
weather, predators, toxic plants, or even himself. Remember that just about 
every land-based predator on the planet considers the rabbit a potential meal. 
Although a few minutes of carefully supervised time to roam may be okay, an 
enclosed area is the best way to protect your rabbit from tragedy.
Thinking about location, location, location
Whether you choose to go with a pen or a run, where you put your rabbit’s 
exercise area is important. Rabbits have a prey animal physiology and psy-
chology and shouldn’t be exposed to constant havoc and noise, which causes 
excessive stress. Likewise, you want your rabbit’s exercise area in a place 
where you can see it and where you can access it easily for cleaning and 
other chores.
 
To keep your rabbit’s nerves at ease, avoid putting the exercise area in a place 
where too much activity takes place. For example, if your kids like to play bas-
ketball in the backyard, don’t put your bunny in a place where the ball is likely 
to bang against the pen. Or if you have a motorcycle, don’t put the pen where 
your rabbit can listen to the engine start up every day (a great sound to you, 
perhaps, but murder on a rabbit’s sensitive ears). By using common sense, 
you can figure out the best spot in your yard from a rabbit’s perspective.
 
On the other hand, you don’t want to tuck your rabbit’s exercise area away in 
a part of the yard where you can’t easily see him. Locating the pen where you 
can see him from your back window or door is ideal. Not only can this location 
enable you to keep an eye on your rabbit, but it will also afford you the pleasure 
of seeing your bunny’s activities when he doesn’t know that you’re watching.
 
No matter how secure you believe your rabbit’s outdoor exercise area is, steer 
clear of nighttime fitness sessions and strolls. The sights and sounds of preda-
tors can scare your bunny to death, literally.
Going the pen route
One way to create a secure outdoor exercise area is to use dog exercise fenc-
ing that comes in panels that can be connected together in many shapes. 
Ideally, an outdoor exercise pen should have a top (to keep predators out) 
and a bottom (to keep bunny in). One advantage of using these panels is that 
the pen is temporary, and you can relocate it when necessary. See the next 
section, however, for a more permanent exercise solution.
Building a bunny run
If you like the idea of leaving your outdoor rabbit outside for an extended 
period of time, but yet don’t have time to hang out and watch him, consider 
building your pet a bunny run. A bunny run is similar to a dog run, except it’s 
not as tall.

125
 Chapter 8: Making Fitness and Fresh Air Fun for Your Bunny
When building a run for your bunny, keep these points in the forefront of 
your mind:
 
✓ The object is to build an enclosure that allows your rabbit time out-
doors while still keeping him protected from predators. Don’t skimp on 
the design or materials. The stronger and more well built your rabbit’s 
run, the safer he is. However, even with these precautions, you still need 
to keep a close eye on him.
 
✓ To keep predators (hawks, raccoons, snakes, and so on.) out and bun-
nies in (don’t forget what skilled diggers they are!), use chain link or 
1-inch wire fencing with a top, bottom, and sides; a solid top will protect 
your bun from the sun. Covering the bottom with clean straw gives your 
rabbit something safe to dig and burrow into.
 
✓ The larger your run, the more exercise your rabbit gets. Make the run as 
big as you can.
 
✓ Provide your rabbit with shade. In fact, building the run in an area where 
shade covers at least half the cage all day is best. Rabbits are suscepti-
ble to overheating, and direct sun can be deadly in the summer. Include 
a dish of fresh water, too.
 
✓ Provide a hide box for your rabbit. Should something spook your bunny 
while he’s in his run, he’ll be grateful for a hide box where he can duck 
for cover.
 
✓ Put some toys and a chew block or two in your rabbit’s run to help give 
him something to do when he’s out roaming around. Consider a bit of 
fresh hay as well.
 
✓ Never keep your rabbit in his run after the sun goes down because pred-
ators are more likely to lurk at dusk or evening. Remember, even if a 
predator can’t get his choppers on your bunny, the presence of a preda-
tor can literally scare a rabbit to death.
 
✓ Make sure that you’re home when your bunny is in the run. Don’t leave 
him in the run while you go off to work. If he gets into trouble (such as 
an encounter with a predator, gets a foot caught in the fencing, or what-
ever), you won’t be around to help him.
Motivating a lazy bunny
Not all rabbits will jump when given the opportunity to exercise. In particu-
lar, single bunnies need a little more motivation to exercise than do two 
rabbits. When you let your solo bunny out in the yard to play, he’ll probably 
run around a bit and then settle down to do some grazing and investigating. 

126
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
To encourage your pet to stretch his muscles, you should provide him with 
some toys that he can amuse himself with. Such toys may include
 
✓ A clean, empty bucket
 
✓ An empty paper towel roll
 
✓ An empty cardboard box
 
✓ Hard plastic balls (try large and small sizes to see which your pet prefers)
 
✓ A tube of some kind, big enough for your rabbit to hop through
 
You can also play with your rabbit yourself by letting him chase you or by 
dragging a toy on a string for him to chase. Refrain from chasing your rabbit 
yourself because the poor creature may think that you’ve gone into predator 
mode and will become terrified. (For more game ideas, see Chapter 14.)
Taking care of outdoor chores
Even though your rabbit’s pen, run, or exercise area is outside and beyond 
the reach of your nose, you still need to keep up with your cleaning. Any 
dirty rabbit area is a breeding ground for bacteria, parasites, and disease. 
Chapter 9 has much more information on health if you’re interested (and you 
should be).
 
But don’t fret. If your rabbit’s outdoor digs are well designed, you shouldn’t 
have too much trouble keeping them clean with minimum effort. Just use the 
clean-up schedule in Table 8-1 (modified, of course, depending on the amount 
of time your bunny is outside).

Your rabbit’s droppings can accumulate quickly and 
should be removed on a daily basis. If possible, set 
up a compost area in your yard for the waste mate-
rial or designate a special covered trash can for 
your rabbit’s waste. Keep a waste receptacle close 
by, along with a shovel, so that it’s easy for you to 
scoop the waste out and into the can without too 
much effort.

To help keep bacteria to a minimum, wash out your

your rabbit’s health. These products are available in 
health-food stores, as well as in many supermarket 
chains.

Weekly
You need to thoroughly clean an outdoor pen or 
cage (nest boxes, too). Once you’ve safely returned 
your bunny to his indoor digs, get a pail that has 1 
part bleach to 10 parts water. Use a sponge to wipe 
down all the surfaces of the pen and then scrub it 
with a bristle brush. This process helps kill bacteria 
and other organisms that are building up. Be certain 
the pen is completely dry before putting your rabbit 
back inside again.
Rabbit-Proofing Your Yard
One of the nicest moments for a rabbit is when he gets to roam about the 
yard, investigating all the sights and smells that surround him. Of course, in 
order for your rabbit to play outside safely, you have to make sure that your 
yard is safely enclosed and free from rabbit hazards. You also need to be 
sure that your yard is protected from your rabbit.
Keeping Wolfie away
Unfortunately, all kinds of predators would like to make a meal out of your 
bunny; preventing that from happening is your job. Most people think that 
cats and dogs are the only creatures they have to worry about preying on 
their rabbits while they’re outdoors, but this is not the case. Most cats find 
rabbits to be too big for hunting purposes (with the exception of the dwarf 
breeds, who are small enough for larger cats), and if your yard and pen are 
secure, a dog probably won’t be able to break in.
 
Predators who can go after your rabbit while he’s getting fresh air include 
raccoons, coyotes, foxes, mink, hawks, and weasels, to name a few. These 
critters often live in suburban and rural areas, and some of them are even 
found in urban sections of the country. All of them are capable of scaling walls 
and fences, subsequently gaining access to seemingly protected backyards.

128
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
If your pen or exercise run is secure, it’s unlikely that one of these animals 
will be able to break in and grab hold of your rabbit. However, a predator 
doesn’t have to make contact with a rabbit in order to hurt or even kill it. 
Because rabbits are so easily frightened, the mere presence of a predator can 
literally scare a rabbit to death. At the least, a rabbit could injure its back, 
legs, or face while leaping around trying to escape.
Another danger is from parasites in the feces of some predators, especially 
the raccoon. Cleaning up all the food in the cage before night falls, and pre-
venting predators from entering or climbing on top of and defecating into the 
cage can prevent exposure.
When a pet lives outside, the danger from predators is inherent. That’s one of 
the main reasons your rabbit lives indoors with you. However, you can take 
the following steps to limit the possibility that a predator can take your pet’s 
life during those times he is outside:
 
✓ Limit your rabbit’s outdoor time to daylight hours when you can 
supervise.
 
✓ Keep your rabbit’s exercise area close to your house. The sound and 
smell of humans can discourage some predators from approaching.
 
✓ Surround the area with an additional fence enclosure. A chain link or 
even chicken wire enclosure with a roof can keep predators from being 
able to get close enough to the area to have access to your rabbit.
 
✓ Keep trash cans covered and avoid leaving pet food outside where the 
smell can attract predators to your yard.
Protecting your rabbit
 
You should have a tall wall or solid fence around your yard, one that a rabbit 
can’t jump over (5 feet high or higher), through, or around. Because rabbits 
are notorious diggers, make sure that your wall or fencing goes at least a foot 
into the ground.
Just as you did when you rabbit-proofed your house (see Chapter 5), look 
at your yard from your rabbit’s point of view (literally!) to see any potential 
dangers. Figuring out what your rabbit sees can give you clues into the kinds 
of trouble he can get into. Look out for the following:
 
✓ Holes or gaps in fencing that are small enough for a rabbit to slip 
through
 
✓ Small nooks and crannies where your rabbit can get wedged

129
 Chapter 8: Making Fitness and Fresh Air Fun for Your Bunny
 
✓ Debris that may come toppling down on your rabbit should he climb 
over or under it
 
✓ Containers holding toxic materials such as paint cans, turpentine, and 
antifreeze
 
✓ Objects with sharp edges
 
✓ Pesticides and other toxic garden products (snail and slug bait are par-
ticularly dangerous)
 
✓ Poisonous plants (check this chapter’s list, “Avoiding poisonous plants”)
Protecting your yard
If you do decide that’s your yard is safe enough for your bunny to roam — 
supervised, of course — for a bit, you should think about protecting your 
yard from your bunny. Rabbits are pretty harmless in general, but they do 
have two good resources when it comes to doing damage: their teeth and 
their claws.
If you look around your yard, you’ll probably notice objects that are vulner-
able to gnawing and areas that are susceptible to digging. For example, your 
rabbit may love to sink his teeth into your really nice wooden deck. Your 
rabbit will probably want to dig a trench in your freshly planted vegetable 
garden and then snack on the veggies after they’re ripe.
So how do you protect your outside goods from your rabbit? You have two 
simple choices:
 
✓ Keep your rabbit in a properly enclosed area, such as a puppy pen or 
a rabbit run while he’s outdoors. Puppy pens create a nice temporary 
exercise area, are moveable (so waste material doesn’t burn the yard 
and you can put it in shade or sun), and fold up when not needed. Pens 
are an inexpensive, viable option for exercising your rabbit and keeping 
him away from the things in the yard you want to protect. A rabbit run 
is a more permanent option. (For more on these options, see the section 
“Outdoors,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Supervise him while he’s roaming around outdoors. Keep an eye on 
him and see what he gets into. If you see him starting to gnaw on your 
wood deck or furniture, cover those areas with bubble wrap or another 
heavy plastic. If your bunny starts digging in the garden, put a fence 
around the area so that he can’t get into it. You may want to provide 
him with a big box of dirt or sand that he can dig through to his heart’s 
content or let him have an area of soft ground to excavate.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Avoiding poisonous plants
Rabbits love to graze on plants when they’re spending time outdoors. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know every single plant that can be poisonous to rab-
bits, or how much they would have to eat to be poisoned. Just to be safe, it’s 
best to keep rabbits away from plants that are known to be toxic in general.
 
If you have any of these common plants in your yard, remove them or find a 
way to keep your rabbit from gaining access to them:
 
✓ Jack in the pulpit, Arisaema spp.
 
✓ Common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca L.
 
✓ Boxwood, Buxus microphylla
 
✓ Oriental bittersweet, Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.
 
✓ Poison hemlock, Conium maculatum
 
✓ Lily of the valley, Convallaria majalis
 
✓ Toadstools, Crepidotus spp.
 
✓ Jimson weed, Datura spp.

Plants for safe snacking
 
Many outdoor plants make safe and healthy snacks for domestic rabbits. 
However, you need to familiarize yourself with any plant before feeding it to 
your rabbit. Please be cautious when offering new plants! The following list is 
simply a sampling of plants that are thought to be safe for domestic rabbits, 
but consult your veterinarian if you’re unsure or your rabbit experiences any 
unusual negative effects.
Only offer your rabbit fresh or thoroughly dried samples of these plants — 
never frosted, wilted, or otherwise spoiled.
 
✓ Apple (Malus domestica; leaves, branches, fruit, but not seeds)
 
✓ Basil (Ocimum basilicum)
 
✓ Blackberry (Rubus villosus*; leaves, stems, fruit)
 
✓ Chickweed (Stellaria media)
 
✓ Chicory, wild (Cichorium intybus)
 
✓ Clover, red (Trifolium pretense)
 
✓ Clover, white (Trifolium repens)
 
✓ Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale; leaves, stem, flower)
 
✓ Grape (Vitus labrusca*; leaves and vines)
 
✓ Lemon balm (Melissa officianalis)
 
✓ Maple, silver (Acer saccharinum; leaves and branches)
 
✓ Maple, sugar (Acer saccharum; leaves and branches)
 
✓ Mint (Mentha piperita*)
 
✓ Pear (Pyrus communis*; leaves, branches, fruit, but not seeds)

Nipping Common Health 
Problems in the Bud
In This Chapter
▶ Finding the right vet
▶ Spaying and neutering
▶ Recognizing signs of pain
▶ Spotting symptoms of illness
You may not be surprised to discover that your rabbit, like all creatures, 
can easily become sick or injured if he’s mishandled or improperly cared 
for. In fact, rabbits can get sick even if you take really good care of them. Of 
course, a rabbit who’s well cared for is less likely to become ill, but it can 
happen. The key to keeping your rabbit healthy is to watch him closely for 
signs of illness because rabbits are good at hiding their illness — a trait that’s 
frustrating for rabbit owners but valuable in the wild. Rabbits instinctively hide 
their illness so that predators are unable to detect their vulnerability.
Most illnesses are more successfully treated if they’re caught early. Familiarize 
yourself with your rabbit’s normal behavior so that you’ll notice when some-
thing is wrong — before it’s too late. While this chapter covers more of the 
common ailments that bug bunnies, Chapter 10 outlines many of the chronic 
health problems of rabbits, as well as those health problems that arise later in 
life. Chapter 17 covers ten signs that you need to take emergency action.
 
If your rabbit gets sick, taking him to a veterinarian who specializes in treating 
rabbits is vital. After you locate a good veterinarian, bring your rabbit in for 
annual checkups.

134
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Finding Dr. Doolittle
No matter what kind of pet you own, finding a good veterinarian is impera-
tive. Unfortunately, finding a vet who treats rabbits may be harder than you 
think, so please find a vet before you have an emergency situation.
A small animal vet who treats only cats and dogs isn’t a good bet when it 
comes to treating a rabbit because rabbits have a unique physiology that’s 
very different from more common pets (see Chapter 1). In the world of 
veterinarian medicine, rabbits are considered exotics, and they’re grouped 
together with rodents, reptiles, birds, and other less common pets. Most 
veterinarians who have a special interest in treating these kinds of animals 
advertise themselves as exotics practitioners. They not only have special 
training in this area, but also a certain level of experience.
Not only must your vet know rabbits inside and out, but she must also be 
good at what she does. Just as with any profession, the skills and attitudes of 
veterinarians differ from individual to individual. You need to find a vet who 
is good at handling rabbits, excellent at diagnosing them, and an ace at treat-
ment. Finding someone who has a good bedside manner with human clients 
isn’t a bad idea, either.
 
In most areas of the country very few veterinarians have specific training or 
extensive experience with exotic pets. For example, people who live in rural 
areas won’t have the selection that city dwellers have. Therefore, you may 
have to deal with a small animal vet who’s willing to work with you and learn 
about your pet.
So how do you find a veterinarian to treat your rabbit? You can use a number 
of different options:
 
✓ Personal referrals. Talk to other rabbit owners and find out which vets 
they use. Ask them what they like about each one and get details of the 
situations where they’ve used them. By listening to these stories, you 
can get a good sense of who each doctor is.
 
✓ Rescue groups or shelters. Talk to the knowledgeable folks at rescue 
groups and shelters or check the House Rabbit Society’s online referral 
list (www.rabbit.org/vets/vets.html) for a state-by-state listing of 
veterinarians who practice veterinary medicine on rabbits.
 
✓ Veterinarians. Even if they don’t treat rabbits themselves, vets often 
know of exotic vets that do. Talk to local vets (you can find them in the 
phone book or through a state association of veterinarians) to get 
recommendations.
 
✓ Veterinary organizations. Contact the Association of Exotic Mammal 
Veterinarians (AEMV), an organization dedicated to improving 

135
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
medicine and surgery of the exotic companion mammals (www.aemv.
org). In 2009, veterinarians will be able to apply for exotic companion 
mammal specialist status through the American Board of Veterinary 
Practitioners (www.abvp.com). Several other organizations are consid-
ering adding exotic companion mammals as a specialty, so in the not-
too-distant future, rabbit owners will truly be able to look for boarded 
specialists for their pets.
 
✓ Club referrals. Contact a local rabbit breed club or 4-H club to get a 
referral to a local exotics veterinarian. Please note that many people 
who participate in clubs or breeding do not subscribe to a house rabbit 
philosophy, so their veterinary needs may differ from yours.
Evaluating a vet
Once you find a vet or two that you think you might like to use, contact the 
office by telephone and ask the following questions:
 
✓ How long have you been treating rabbits? The answer should be at 
least two years, preferably longer.
 
✓ How many rabbits are treated at the office each week? Ask, too, 
about the number of rabbits that are spayed or neutered each week. 
This answer gives you a good idea whether a vet really has a sufficient 
amount of experience with rabbits.
 
✓ What kind of special education or experience do you have treating 
rabbits? You want a vet who has training in this area, or at least has a 
significant amount of experience to make up for lack of formal training. 
Continuing education courses and programs are a good sign that this 
vet is serious about treating rabbits.
 
✓ Which antibiotics do you prescribe to rabbits? Some antibiotics com-
monly given to cats and dogs can be fatal for rabbits. An experienced 
veterinarian will know not to use amoxicillin and most of the other “...
cillin” drugs. Chapter 10 covers more on antibiotics.
 
✓ Do you take after-hour emergencies? If not, where are they sent? If 
your vet closes at 6 p.m. and can’t be reached for emergencies that take 
place after hours, she most likely refers patients to a 24-hour emergency 
clinic. Ask questions about the clinic’s experience with rabbits and visit 
it to make sure that it meets your requirements.
 
✓ May I visit your clinic to look at your facilities? The answer should be 
a resounding “Yes.” Please respect the fact that an appointment may be 
necessary so as not to interfere with the services given to clients during 
the day.

136
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
Once you’ve narrowed your search, pay a visit to the clinic. While you’re 
there, look for the following:
 
✓ Clean environment: A clinic should look and smell clean. The exam 
rooms and reception areas should be neat and tidy, and the personnel 
should be well groomed.
 
✓ Friendly, knowledgeable staff: The receptionist and technicians you 
meet should be nice, friendly, and willing and able to answer questions.
 
✓ Skilled vet: You probably won’t get to see the vet in action until you 
make your first appointment. When you’re there, observe how she 
handles your rabbit. The vet should be gentle but firm and patient. She 
should also be willing to answer your questions, admit when she doesn’t 
know the answer to something, and be friendly and a good listener.
 
✓ Affordable fees: With veterinary care, you often get what you pay for. 
Don’t expect to get great care for dirt-cheap prices. On the other hand, 
make sure that you can afford the services offered. Ask for a fee schedule, 
which should show what the clinic charges for examinations, lab fees, and 
spays and neuters.
Being a good client
You want a veterinarian who’s skilled and 
compassionate and will take excellent care of 
your rabbit. You can do a lot to make sure that 
you’re a good client, too, by following these 
guidelines:
 ✓ If you’re happy with your vet, be sure to 
stick with her. Don’t jump around from clinic 
to clinic trying to save money.
 ✓ Pay your bills on time. If you’re having trou-
ble paying, be honest with your vet and try 
to work out a payment arrangement.
 ✓ Follow your vet’s instructions thoroughly 
regarding your rabbit’s health.
 ✓ Be honest with your vet about your rabbit’s 
care and condition.
 ✓ Ask questions if you don’t understand expla-
nations, diagnosis, or treatment plans.
 ✓ If you have a complaint with the veterinary 
staff, bring it to the vet’s attention first so 
that there’s an opportunity to get it cleared 
up to your satisfaction.
 ✓ Never be afraid to get a second or even 
third opinion. A responsible veterinarian 
won’t feel threatened if you seek other 
ideas.
 ✓ Be a proactive pet owner and do research 
as needed to help your pet. Bring any infor-
mation to your veterinarian and discuss 
your findings.

137
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
Going for an exam
Unlike dogs and cats, rabbits don’t get annual inoculations (except in the 
U.K. with myxomatosis and hemorrhagic viral diseases; see Chapter 10). 
However,’ taking your rabbit to the vet for an initial exam is an excellent idea, 
even if he appears healthy. The vet can check him to make sure that he’s in 
good health and can discuss your rabbit’s diet, plans for neutering, and other 
health-related issues.
The initial exam also gives you the opportunity to get to know your veterinar-
ian, and gives the doctor a sense of who your rabbit is. If your pet gets sick 
and needs immediate care, the vet will already have information on file and 
have a good sense of how you’re caring for your bunny.
 
Following that initial exam, annual exams are a good idea. These annual exams 
are invaluable in keeping ahead of disease problems and in communicating 
any changes in care. As they become geriatric (7 years of age and older), get 
an exam every 6 months.
Spay It, Don’t Spray It
 
Plenty of good reasons exist to spay your female rabbit (having her uterus and 
ovaries removed) or neuter your male rabbit (having his testicles removed), 
including improved behavior (see Chapters 12 and 13) and the elimination of 
the potential for more unwanted rabbits in the world (see Chapter 2). But one 
of the best reasons is for the health of your rabbit.
 
Spayed and neutered rabbits are less prone to a variety of diseases and tend 
to live considerably longer than rabbits who haven’t been spayed or neutered. 
Male rabbits who haven’t been neutered are also inclined to spray strong 
smelling urine around the house and get into other kinds of trouble. You’ll be 
much happier with your male rabbit if you have him neutered.
 
Rabbits can be spayed or neutered as soon as they reach reproductive matu-
rity: about 4 months of age or later. Females should be spayed before 2 years 
of age to lessen the chance of developing uterine cancer. (See this chapter’s 
“Fighting female troubles” for more on that topic.) Both procedures are fairly 
routine in the hands of a veterinarian experienced with rabbits.

138
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
The cost for these procedures varies depending on many factors, including the 
area of the country in which you live and the age and health of your pet. The 
spay procedure takes considerably longer than a castration to perform and 
requires abdominal surgery; therefore, the cost for spaying a female may be two 
or more times the cost of neutering a male. Many veterinarians require presur-
gical laboratory work to make sure that your pet is in good health prior to the 
procedure. Please discuss with your vet any questions you may have. This one-
time cost is well worth it, however, because a spayed or neutered rabbit lives a 
longer, healthier life.
Playing Doctor
An annual trip to the vet is a good idea, but you can do a great deal for your 
rabbit’s health on your own. Your rabbit is likely to live a much healthier 
life if you monitor her health every day and prepare yourself for any first aid 
emergencies that may arise.
Whether it’s daily (during a petting session) or weekly (while you’re brushing 
your bun), get in the habit of doing the following eight-point check, starting 
at the top:
 
✓ Ears: Look inside and out to see whether they’re clean and smooth, 
without sores, bumps, flaking, or excessive wax build up.
 
✓ Eyes: Be certain eyes are clear, clean, and free of discharge.
Counting backwards from ten
If your bunny needs surgery or a certain diag-
nostic procedure requiring that he be anes-
thetized, you may be worried. Is it safe to put 
bunnies under anesthesia? Can their sensitive 
systems handle the chemicals required for sur-
gery or diagnosis?
The answer to these questions is yes. In fact, 
other than the obvious need for anesthesia 
during surgery, it’s often better to sedate the 
rabbit for stressful diagnostic procedures. Doing 
so eliminates your pet’s fear or discomfort. A 
safe anesthetic gas (usually in combination 
with other injectable drugs to reduce anxiety 
and pain) is used for general anesthesia, which 
produces complete unconsciousness. If lighter 
sedation is needed, the vet can use a variety of 
injectable drugs. Sometimes a local anesthetic 
alone is all that’s needed (for example, in eye 
exams or small skin biopsies).
If your bunny needs surgery for spaying or neu-
tering or some other medical procedure, take 
your pet to a veterinarian with rabbit experi-
ence. The vet can determine the safest method 
of anesthesia to minimize discomfort and stress 
for your pet.

139
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
✓ Nose: Look for a dry clean nose and listen for clear, regular breathing.
 
✓ Mouth: Check that your rabbit’s teeth are aligned (growing straight) and 
not overgrown or broken. Make sure that she’s not drooling.
 
✓ Fur/skin: Feel her body for unusual lumps, bruises, cuts, or sores.
 
✓ Tootsies: Make sure that her toes are all straight, with no signs of lumps 
or inflamed tissue. Bottoms of paws should be covered with fur; any vis-
ible skin should not look bright red or infected.
 
✓ Nails: Check that nails aren’t too long. Those that are may tear off, 
bleed, and even become infected.
 
✓ Genital area: Take a peek at her privates to be sure that the area is 
clean and dry. (See Chapter 8 to find out how to spot clean if it isn’t.)
Fighting female troubles
Unspayed female rabbits can develop a vari-
ety of problems. The ailments listed here can 
happen before, during, or after a pregnancy 
and some occur even if you never breed your 
rabbit. Knowing how to recognize these prob-
lems increases your doe’s chances of survival.
Keep in mind that spaying your doe eliminates 
the possibility of all these conditions developing 
in your rabbit.
 ✓ False pregnancies: Female rabbits are so 
geared toward pregnancy that those who 
aren’t bred can act as if they’re pregnant 
anyway. Even though she isn’t carrying any 
new baby bunnies, milk production and 
other characteristics associated with preg-
nancy appear. The female may become 
aggressive as part of this condition.
 ✓ Mammary gland disorders: Nursing 
mother rabbits are prone to a number of 
problems that affect the mammary glands, 
or breast tissue. Each requires help from a 
veterinarian.
 ✓ Pregnancy toxemia: This condition occurs 
in the last few days of pregnancy or the 
first days after giving birth. Does with 
pregnancy toxemia can develop depres-
sion, weakness, seizures, and coma.
 ✓ Endometritis and pyometra: Endometritis 
is an inflammatory disease of the lining of 
the uterus, and pyometra is an accumula-
tion of pus in the uterus accompanying 
the inflammation. With mild disease, there 
may be few signs; however, as the disease 
progresses, she may develop a distended 
abdomen, loss of appetite, and weakness.
 ✓ Uterine adenocarcinoma: Uterine adenocar-
cinoma is a form of cancer of the uterus and 
is the most common cancer seen in intact 
female rabbits. Although it’s a slow-growing 
tumor, if left untreated, it can metastasize, 
or spread, through the body, attacking the 
lungs, liver, bones, skin, and other organs. 
Eventually, it can result in death.
 ✓ Uterine aneurysm: Uterine aneurysm is a 
noninfectious disease that results from the 
rupture of one or more large veins in the 
uterus. These veins can rupture and heal 
several times. The blood loss may be grad-
ual or sudden. If the blood loss is excessive, 
the results can be fatal.

140
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
If you notice anything out of the ordinary, including any odd behavior, contact 
your veterinarian right away.
 
Though it may not be much fun, you should also keep track of what’s coming 
out of your rabbit. Changes in urine and feces can signal serious health 
problems, so do the following each day:
 
✓ Check your bunny’s urine for unusual color, odor, or consistency. 
Changesin urine or urination habits may be a sign of dietary changes or 
disease. (For more on this topic, see this chapter’s “Urinary tract 
concerns.”)
 
✓ Check your rabbit’s droppings and get an idea of what’s normal. Any 
changes in size and consistency can indicate a gastrointestinal problem. 
(See “Gastrointestinal problems,” later in this chapter.)

Although many ailments described here require a vet’s attention, it’s a great 
idea to have some basic medical supplies on hand in the event that your 
rabbit needs some minor medical attention. Store these items in a tool or 
tackle box, with your vet’s phone number and address taped to the inside:
 
✓ Antibiotic ointment (be sure it’s safe for animals; your vet may recom-
mend Neosporin, the formula without pain relief)
 
✓ Thermometer (animal or pediatric rectal; normal is about 103 to 106°F) 
and lubricant, such as K-Y jelly.
 
✓ Stethoscope (for listening to intestinal sounds and the heart and lungs)
 
✓ Hydrogen peroxide for cleansing (use diluted)
 
✓ Cotton swabs and cotton balls
 
✓ Heating pad or hot water bottle for shock or hypothermia
 
✓ Styptic powder or cornstarch for bleeding nails
 
✓ Saline eye wash (to flush out foreign matter)
 
✓ Gauze bandages and sterile cotton pads for wounds
 
✓ Plastic medicine dropper
 
✓ Tweezers
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Towel for wrapping or securing your rabbit

 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
Identifying signs of pain
Chapter 11 talks in depth about your pet’s body language and what he does 
when he’s in the world of hurt. If you’re unsure about whether your bunny 
needs vet care, use the following signs as a cue that you need to call a vet:
 
✓ Abnormal hunched appearance when sitting
 
✓ Alert but reluctant to move
 
✓ Moves slowly or with effort
 
✓ Depression/lethargy
 
✓ Limping
 
✓ Unusual or sudden aggression
 
✓ Loss or decrease in appetite or water consumption
 
✓ Tooth grinding
 
✓ Hiding when it’s not usual behavior, facing the corner
 
✓ Shows no interest in the surroundings (loss of curiosity)
 
✓ Crying or grunting when moving/defecating/urinating or being handled/
examined
 
✓ Coat is unkempt due to loss of interest in grooming
 
✓ Taking a long time to eat
 
✓ Dropping food out of the mouth
Dealing with Bunny Ailments
Rabbits can develop a whole slew of diseases and conditions; some of the 
more common health problems are covered here. Chapter 10 addresses other 
health problems, such as infectious diseases and conditions related to aging.
If you know how to recognize rabbit ailments, you’ll respond quickly, call-
ing the vet and getting appropriate treatment. The more quickly that you 
respond, the better your chances of effectively eliminating any disease or dis-
comfort that’s afflicting your rabbit.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Gastrointestinal problems
Rabbits are prone to a number of gastrointestinal (GI) tract problems. The 
most common underlying cause of these disorders is an inappropriate diet. 
However, various microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and viruses can 
play a role, too. In rare cases, some rabbits are born with a GI tract that 
doesn’t function normally.
 
Since proper diet is so important for GI health, the best thing you can do to 
prevent disease of the GI tract is feed a healthy diet high in fiber and low in 
carbohydrates. By following the dietary suggestions in Chapter 6, you reduce 
the likelihood that your rabbit will develop digestive problems. In the event 
that your rabbit does feel under the weather as a result of digestive tract dis-
ease, you and your vet can hopefully step in and get her back to normal.
 
Diarrhea in rabbits is characterized by the excretion of large amounts of dark 
brown to blood-tinged stool in the absence of any normal stool. Diarrhea is 
a different condition than soft stools, which is a mixture of soft pudding-like 
stools mixed with normal stools. Diarrhea can be the result of several different 
diseases, but it’s always an emergency signal and is a life-threatening situation. 
Seek veterinary attention immediately if you observe diarrhea in your rabbit.
Soft stool
Soft pudding-like stools present along with normal round, dry stools are a 
sign of a disruption of the delicate balance in the rabbit’s intestinal flora. This 
condition is not life-threatening, but needs to be treated before it progresses 
to a more severe disease.
 
Rabbits normally produce two types of droppings. One is the round hard stool 
you find in great profusion in your rabbit’s cage, and the other is the nutrient-
rich cecotrope produced from the cecum and is eaten directly by the rabbit to 
be digested. (See Chapter 1 for more information on rabbit GI physiology.)
Normally you never see the cecotropes and if, on occasion, you do, they 
should be soft but formed in small, oblong pellets. When there’s a mild dis-
ruption to the normal flora of the cecum, the cecotropes come out unformed 
in mucous-coated blobs or pools of thick pudding-like stool. (Sounds appetiz-
ing, doesn’t it?) This isn’t true diarrhea because the rabbit can still produce 
the normal round droppings. These soft cecotropes get stuck to the rabbit’s 
fur and are deposited to dry into an almost concrete-like substance in the 
cage and exercise areas. The rabbit can’t eat the cecotropes because they 
have no form and these sticky clumps can eventually cause not only a clean-
ing headache, but an impaction of stool on the bunny’s rear end.
The most common cause of soft cecotropes is a high-carbohydrate, low-
fiber diet. Other, less common causes are cancer, internal abscesses, partial 

143
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
intestinal obstruction, and other systemic diseases, such as liver or kidney 
disease. It’s best to have your rabbit examined by a veterinarian to make sure 
that there is no underlying disease. Because the majority of cases are caused 
by an inappropriate diet, all that’s usually necessary for treatment is a switch 
to a high-fiber diet low in concentrated carbohydrates. See Chapter 6 for 
details on feeding your rabbit a healthy diet.
 
If a rabbit doesn’t produce any stool for 24 hours, he’s in need of immediate 
medical attention. The most common cause is a complete or partial obstruc-
tion to the GI tract or a complete shutdown of the GI tract caused by a chronic 
GI motility problem. These conditions are fatal within 48 hours if left untreated. 
Chapter 17 has more information on this topic, including symptoms that may 
accompany this lack of stools.
Enteritis
The rabbit GI tract, particularly the cecum, contains a complex population of 
bacteria, protozoa, yeast, and other organisms that make it possible to digest 
high-fiber foods. Any change in this population can lead to a disruption of 
normal digestive ability and, in some cases, to life-threatening disease.
Enteritis is an infection or inflammation of the intestines and has a number of 
causes. Rabbits suffering from enteritis may have
 
✓ Stools ranging from occasional soft stools to outright diarrhea
 
✓ Bloated abdomen
 
✓ Teeth crunching
 
✓ Restlessness
 
✓ Lack of appetite
 
✓ Weight loss
By far, the most common cause of enteritis is feeding your pet the wrong diet, 
particularly one that is low in fiber and high in carbohydrates. (See Chapter 6 for 
what bunnies should eat.) Other causes include the use of antibiotics that are 
inappropriate for the rabbit, exposure to high levels of stress, and exposure 
to certain bacteria. (See Chapter 10 for more information.) Really, anything 
that causes a serious change in the normal population of healthy microor-
ganisms in the rabbit’s gut will allow “bad” bacteria to overgrow leading to 
disease. If your rabbit is showing any abnormalities in his stools, you should 
contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.
 
The most important thing you can do to safeguard your rabbit from enteritis is 
to feed a healthy high-fiber diet, as well as provide a clean, stress-free 
environment (see Chapters 5 and 6).

144
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Enterotoxemia
The most dangerous complication that happens because of disruption of the 
GI tract’s normal bacteria is enterotoxemia. This condition occurs when bac-
teria that are normally present — and cause no trouble (such as Clostridium 
species or E. coli) — start to overgrow.
When these bacteria proliferate, they produce dangerous toxins absorbed 
into the blood stream, and they poison the rabbit. Enterotoxemia is seen most 
often in young weaning rabbits, but can be seen in any rabbit that has had a 
severe disruption of the normal GI tract flora due to the conditions covered in 
the “Enteritis” section, earlier in this chapter.
Medicating your rabbit
If your bunny is diagnosed with an illness, 
chances are she’ll need medication. (Be wary 
of antibiotics, as some are toxic to rabbits; 
see Chapter 10 for more on using antibiotics.) 
Medication may be in the form of a pill, liquid, 
or eye or eardrops. Ask your vet to show you 
how to administer the medication before you 
take your bunny home. Before you begin, take a 
deep breath and resolve to be patient. Rabbits 
can be uncooperative when being medicated, 
so be prepared.
Your rabbit may drink the liquid medicine out of 
a bowl. Today, most medications are offered in 
liquid form, eliminating the hassle of trying to 
disguise a pill:
The best way to restrain your rabbit is to
 1. Have the medication all measured out and 
ready to go.
 2. Wrap her in a towel.
 3. Stabilize the bunny against your body.
 
 Keep your rabbit from struggling so much 
that she hurts herself.
 4. Talk to her in a soothing voice and try to 
help her calm down while you administer 
the medications.
Your method of administering medicine to your 
rabbit will depend on the form of the medication. 
Here are tips on how to give a variety of medi-
cations:
 ✓ Liquid medication: You can put liquids in 
a syringe (without the needle) and place it 
in the space between the incisors and the 
molars on the side of the mouth. Slowly 
inject the liquid, letting your bunny swallow 
it. Don’t put the rabbit on her back because 
she may inhale the medication into her 
lungs if you do that.
 ✓ Eyedrops or ointment: You can pull down 
the lower lid of the eye and place the drops 
or ointment in the pocket between the eye-
ball and the lid. When the rabbit closes her 
eye, the medication spreads around the 
surface of the eyeball. Be careful not to 
touch the eye with the applicator.
 ✓ Eardrops: Simply place the medication into 
the rabbit’s ears and then gently massage 
the base of the ear to get it worked down 
into the ear canal. Expect plenty of ear-
shaking and scratching. (Having something 
cold and wet running down your ear canal 
feels weird!) Be sympathetic toward your 
bunny and be sure to help her wipe her face 
clean if the ear medication musses her fur.

145
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
Signs of enterotoxemia include
 
✓ Profuse diarrhea that’s brown or bloody
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Weakness
 
✓ Sudden death
 
If you suspect that your rabbit is suffering from enterotoxemia, contact your 
veterinarian right away because this condition is rapidly fatal if left untreated 
with medicine. It’s better to prevent this serious disease altogether with a 
high-fiber diet.
Urinary tract concerns
Rabbits are prone to a number of ailments that affect the bladder and kid-
neys. Each of these maladies is serious and requires immediate veterinary 
treatment. If you’re doing a good job of monitoring what comes out of your 
rabbit, you may notice changes in your rabbit’s urine that can signal prob-
lems in your rabbit’s urinary tract or elsewhere.
Seeing red: Colorful urine
Normal rabbit urine can be quite colorful and range from light yellow to a 
deep orange-red (a rusty color). This rainbow of colors could be scary if you 
didn’t know it was normal. The colors are produced either by pigments that 
pass through the system from some food or from normal pigments called por-
phyrins, which are excreted by the bladder.
 
Be alert, however, when the urine is bright red. Bright red color or red streaks 
is usually an indication of blood coming either from the urinary tract or, in the 
case of an unspayed female, from the reproductive tract (see the earlier side-
bar “Fighting female troubles”), and is definitely something to pay attention 
to. Sometimes it can be hard to differentiate red from the rusty (which is more 
orange) color of plant pigments. It is easy to tell the difference by having your 
veterinarian test a fresh urine sample. If you see red in your rabbit’s urine, 
particularly if she strains to urinate or acts abnormal in any other way, seek 
veterinary attention as soon as possible.
Cystitis
An infection of the urinary tract or bladder, cystitis is somewhat common in 
rabbits. Signs of the condition are the same as urolithiasis. (See the list in the 
upcoming “Urolithiasis” section.)

146
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Because these symptoms are similar to that of urolithiasis, taking your rabbit 
to a veterinarian immediately for diagnosis is critical. Cystitis may be cured 
with long-term antibiotic treatment.
 
Rabbits who develop cystitis often have recurring bouts of the condition, so 
watch them closely for recurrences.
Kidney disease
Kidney disease (also called renal disease) can occur, particularly in older rab-
bits. Kidney disease can be caused by bacterial infection, parasites, toxins, 
or cancer. See whether your rabbit has any of the following signs of kidney 
disease:
 
✓ Anemia (may be indicated by pale gum color)
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Poor appetite
 
✓ Weight loss
 
✓ Excessive water consumption
 
✓ Excessive amounts of urine
 
Kidney disease is a serious condition. The sooner treatment takes place, the 
better your pet’s chances for survival. If you see any of these signs, take her to 
a veterinarian right away.
Urolithiasis
 
Urolithiasis is seen in rabbits. Rabbits, unlike dogs, cats, and humans, normally 
excrete any extra calcium from their diet through their urine, which can give 
normal rabbit urine a cloudy look. (Humans, dogs, and cats excrete extra cal-
cium through the stool.)
Occasionally, rabbits can develop stones or bladder sludge (thick material not 
yet formed into stones). The causes can be many, including long-term inad-
equate water intake (leading to more concentrated urine), underlying bladder 
infection, and genetic predisposition. The high calcium level of some foods 
has often been blamed entirely for this disease, but this alone won’t cause 
stones. Inadequate water intake can occur when the water isn’t changed fre-
quently, is frozen, or isn’t easily accessible.
Rabbits suffering from urolithiasis show the following signs:
 
✓ Straining to urinate
 
✓ Frequent small amounts of urine produced, often outside of the normal 
toilet areas
 
✓ Small stones or blood present in the urine

147
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Abdominal pain (hunched posture)
 
If your rabbit shows any of these signs, take her to your veterinarian imme-
diately for diagnosis and treatment. Surgery may be necessary in the case of 
large stones. Sludge and small stones can often be flushed out of the bladder 
under anesthesia.
The best prevention for bladder stones is making sure that your rabbit
 
✓ Takes in sufficient amounts of water daily. Chapter 6 discusses 
suggested water quantities for rabbits.
 
✓ Eats a healthy diet including high-moisture fresh foods, which adds water 
to his system. Read Chapter 6 for recommendations for fresh foods.
 
✓ Has available water changed daily and that the bottle is working prop-
erly. That way, your pet doesn’t have to work too hard to get a drink.
 
✓ Exercises. You can get ideas on exercising in Chapters 8 and 14.
 
✓ Has a clean toilet area. Cleanliness encourages urination, which keeps 
the bladder contents flushed. Rabbits that aren’t exercised or have 
unclean toilet areas may tend to hold their urine for much longer 
periods of time.
Abscesses
An abscess is a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue, the whole 
mess is typically the result of a bacterial infection. Abscesses, which can 
occur almost anywhere on a rabbit, are common and, unfortunately, difficult 
to treat. Common causes include
 
✓ Bite or puncture wounds
 
✓ Systemic infections
 
✓ Dental infections
The pus found in rabbit abscesses is very thick, which makes drainage and 
treatment particularly difficult. Treatment will vary according to the loca-
tion of the abscess. In many cases, complete surgical removal of the abscess 
is recommended; however, you must address the underlying cause of the 
abscess, or the abscess will return.
Although some rabbits can live with abscesses on their body for years, any 
unusual lump found on your rabbit should be checked by your vet. As with 
other health conditions, early treatment can increase the chance of a cure; in 
addition, lumps can also be tumors or cysts that require immediate removal.

148
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Dental disease
Dental disease is fairly common in pet rabbits. Nature designed your bunny 
to eat a variety of plant materials that includes some tough, abrasive material. 
In order to keep your rabbit’s teeth from wearing down to the point where he 
can’t eat, nature arranged it so that rabbit teeth are always growing.
 
If a rabbit’s teeth are improperly aligned, the teeth won’t wear down properly. 
The result is teeth that grow too long, making it difficult for the rabbit to chew 
(a condition known as malocclusion, which is shown in Figure 9-1). Either the 
crown (the top) of the tooth can overgrow or the root (bottom of the tooth 
under the gum line).
If the crown overgrows, sharp edges form, which can cause sores on the 
tongue and the inside of the mouth. If the root overgrows, it can cause 
deformities of the jaw bone, leading eventually to abscesses (read more on 
abscesses in this chapter). If the upper incisor roots grow too long, they can 
pinch off the tear duct so that tears can’t flow. This situation leads to spilling 
of tears on the face and a chronically wet and matted facial fur.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The rabbit 
on the left 
suffers from 
malocclu-
sion. The 
choppers on 
the right are 
okay.
 
The exact causes of dental disease are still being debated. As in life, multiple 
causes are probably working together. The most commonly mentioned cause 
is inadequate wearing of the teeth due to a diet low in abrasive material 
(fiber), but other experts suspect early metabolic bone disease (a nutritional 
imbalance involving calcium) or bad genetics as well. Trauma to the mouth can 
be another cause of dental disease. Check your rabbit for the following signs of 
dental disease:
 
✓ Being picky about foods (particularly unable to eat pellets or hard 
vegetables)
 
✓ Bulging eye(s)
 
✓ Dropping food from the mouth

149
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
✓ Excessive salivation
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Nasal discharge
 
✓ Tearing eyes
 
✓ Excessive teeth-grinding
 
✓ Lumps along the jaw or under the eye
 
If your rabbit has any of these signs, take him to a veterinarian immediately. 
Dental disease that’s just starting may show no outward signs, so it’s impor-
tant that your veterinarian perform a thorough mouth exam at least once a 
year on even outwardly healthy pets; in fact, most dental disease is related to 
teeth other than the incisors. Early detection is key to treating dental disease 
in rabbits.
Ear infections
Your rabbit’s great big ears are prone to problems that include mites and 
infections. (For more on mites, see this chapter’s upcoming “Banning pesky 
parasites.”) Signs of infection include
 
✓ Head shaking
 
✓ Ear scratching and sensitivity
 
✓ Runny eyes
If you suspect a problem with your bunny’s ears, have her examined by your 
vet; untreated ear infections can lead to head tilt, a more serious condition 
described later in this chapter. Lop ears, which create a warm, moist setting 
for bacterial growth, are particularly at risk for infection.
Heatstroke
 
Your bunny is capable of tolerating cold much better than heat. Rabbits 
who become overheated are susceptible to heatstroke, which can be fatal. 
Temperatures of 80°Fahrenheit are dangerous to rabbits.
Rabbits on the verge of heatstroke lay in a stretched-out posture and pant, 
breathing rapidly and sometimes foaming at the mouth.

150
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Heatstroke is an emergency situation. Before you transport your rabbit to the 
veterinarian, take measures to bring his body temperature down.
 
1. Get him out of the sun and into a cool place.
 
2. Put a cool, wet towel around his ears.
 
 The wet towel around his ears cools the blood that’s flowing through his 
ears. Then that blood circulates throughout the rest of his body, thus 
helping to lower overall body temperature.
 
3. If he’s conscious, offer him fresh water.
 
4. Rush him to the veterinarian for immediate treatment.
 
 The vet will give the rabbit fluids intravenously and other medications.
Head tilt
Head tilt (also called wry neck or torticollis) is a sign of any one of a number of 
problems, including inner ear disease or disease of the vestibular (balance) 
area of the brain, such as cancer, trauma, stroke, or parasitic infection.
 
If your rabbit is tilting his head to one side, take him to your veterinarian right 
away for a diagnosis. Your vet may be able to treat the problem, depending on 
the cause. The earlier head tilt is treated, the greater the chances for a cure, 
so address this condition as soon as you notice it.
If the condition is irreversible despite treatment and your pet is still active 
and eating well, you can opt to let your rabbit live with this condition. Many 
rabbit owners have found that their “tilted” rabbits are able to live relatively 
normal lives.
Inflammation of the feet
Pododermatitis (also known as sore hocks) occurs when the area below the 
hocks (the joint closest to the paw on the hind leg) becomes inflamed and 
How many teeth does my bunny have?
Take a guess. Most people will say rabbits have 
4 incisors, but actually they have 6! Assuming 
all is well with your rabbit’s dental health, her 
mouth should contain 12 upper cheek teeth 
and 10 lower cheek teeth, for a grand total of 
28 teeth.

151
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
develops ulcers, often in conjunction with hair loss. A bacterial infection is 
usually present.
 
Obesity, a dirty, wet environment, or a lack of space within which to move 
around can set the stage for this condition. Your veterinarian can treat sore 
hocks with a wound cleanser and an antibiotic. You can also
 
✓ Keep the cage floor dry and clean. If your pet has an all-wire cage floor, 
provide an area off the wire to sit, like a box with shredded or flat news-
paper in it (in addition to the litter box).
 
✓ Put your rabbit on a diet. Take a look at the nutritional guidelines 
offered in Chapter 6; in particular, read the section that coaches owners 
on how to cope with chubby bunnies.
 
✓ Provide more room and more exercise time for your rabbit. Cages that 
are too small can aggravate the problem. Chapter 8 talks about ways of 
bringing fresh air and exercise into your rabbit’s life.
 
To avoid having to deal with this problem in the first place, keep your rabbit 
fit and healthy and provide him with a clean, good-size cage. (Chapter 5 offers 
more information on smart housing options.)
Obesity
An obese rabbit is at increased risk to develop other health problems. It’s 
vital to prevent this common condition.
 
You can keep a handle on your rabbit’s weight by feeding him properly and 
weighing him regularly to make sure he’s not gaining too much weight. (See 
Chapter 6 for information on proper diet and how to weigh your rabbit.) He’ll 
be weighed at his annual veterinarian visit and your vet can tell you whether 
he’s tipping the scales too far.
Some of the health problems that obesity can contribute to include
 
✓ Difficulty grooming
 
✓ Foot inflammation
 
✓ Inability to ingest cecotropes, rabbit-produced pellets that contain essen-
tial nutrients (see Chapter 1)
 
✓ Sluggish, unhealthy digestive tract
 
✓ Shortened life span
 
✓ Stress on the heart and vertebrae

152
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Rabbits become obese the same way that people do — too many calories and 
not enough exercise. Among rabbits, excess calories often come from eating 
excessive amounts of alfalfa-based commercial rabbit pellets.
Rabbits who eat fresh foods and hay as a primary diet and get regular exer-
cise are less likely to develop obesity. If your rabbit needs slimming down, 
talk to your vet about creating a new diet for your pet. (For more on diet and 
exercise, see Chapters 6 and 8, respectively.)
Paralysis and hind limb weakness
Rabbits are prone to several conditions that can result in weakness or paraly-
sis of the hind legs, including arthritis and fusing of the spinal vertebra, inter-
vertebral disc disease, trauma, parasites, toxins, stroke, bacterial infections, 
cancer, and systemic disease.
Because the conditions that cause hind limb weakness or complete paralysis 
are so variable, you may see a variety of other abnormalities, such as loss 
of appetite, pain, or lethargy. However, any noticeable weakness of the hind 
quarters is abnormal even in the absence of other signs, and your pet should 
get veterinary attention as soon as possible. Some conditions are reversible if 
treated immediately.
 
If your rabbit has any of the aforementioned abnormalities, take him to the vet 
for an evaluation and treatment. Many diligent rabbit owners have been able 
to make life livable for paralyzed bunnies with special care and support. (If 
you’re living with a paralyzed rabbit and need help, contact your local House 
Rabbit Society for information. See the Appendix for contact information.)
Banning Pesky Parasites
Just like dogs and cats, rabbits can be bothered by parasites — organisms 
that feed off your rabbit’s body — that can make them pretty darn miserable. 
Keeping those nasty parasites at bay is your job as a rabbit mom or dad.
Intestinal parasites
Intestinal parasites include roundworms, pinworms, protozoa, and tape-
worms. Signs of a heavy parasite infestation include
 
✓ Distended abdomen
 
✓ Poor coat condition (dry, unhealthy looking hair)

153
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
✓ Worms in the litter box or near the anus
 
✓ Loss of weight even though the pet is eating well
Your rabbit may have a light worm infestation without showing any obvious 
outward signs. Your veterinarian can diagnose intestinal worms in your pet 
by examining a stool sample. (You can get a sample by putting a few pieces 
of your rabbit’s stool in a plastic bag.) Treatment consists of a deworming 
agent, administered orally or by injection to your rabbit.
 
To prevent your rabbit from becoming infested with intestinal parasites:
 
✓ Avoid letting your rabbit graze in areas where wild rabbits may have 
been, particularly where you see their droppings.
 
✓ Keep your bunny away from outdoor areas where dogs and stray cats 
may have defecated.
Ear mites
Settling in the rabbit’s ear canal, ear mites cause itching and a dark, crusty 
discharge. Frequent head-shaking and ear-scratching are common signs.
A veterinarian, examining the discharge from your rabbit’s ears under a 
microscope, can diagnose ear mites. An injection or topical application of 
an antiparasitic drug can successfully treat ear mites. Infected rabbits need 
to be separated from other rabbits until the mites have been cleared up 
because ear mites are highly contagious between rabbits. Also, even though 
the mites that affect cats are different from rabbit ear mites, cats can carry 
the parasite that affects rabbits and pass it along to them. Left untreated, ear 
mites can lead to severe infections that can cause hearing loss.
Fur mites
Fur mites are tiny spiderlike parasites (Chelyletiella parasitovorax) that can 
be seen with mild magnification. Also known as walking dandruff, fur mites 
can cause
 
✓ Clumps of hair to fall out
 
✓ Dry, flaky skin
 
✓ Red, crusty, and itchy patches of skin particularly along the spine and 
rump

154
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Your veterinarian will examine a sample of the skin debris under the micro-
scope. The treatment for this parasite can include topical or injectible anti-
parasitic medications as well as a thorough cleaning of the environment.
 
If the population of mites is low, signs of their presence may be nonexistent 
for a long period of time. (It can be for many months.) However, rabbits can 
still transmit the mites to other rabbits during this time. These mites can 
be transmitted to dogs and cats in the household as well (and back again). 
Treating all the mammal pets in the household as well as the environment is 
important because the mites can live off the pets in bedding, carpeting, and 
around cages for several days.
Fleas
Yes, rabbits get fleas — the exact same fleas that drive your cat and dog 
crazy, too. In fact, if your indoor rabbit becomes infested with fleas, your dog 
or cat are most likely to have spread these parasites to your bunny.
 
To see whether your rabbit has fleas, observe your pet to see whether she’s 
scratching herself a great deal. (Chapter 7 gives the lowdown on finding and 
getting fleas out of her hair.)
The best way to treat fleas is with a topical application (no flea dips, sham-
poos, or powders, please!) available from your veterinarian. Products applied 
once a month to your rabbit’s skin are most effective, making flea reproduc-
tion impossible. All your other mammal pets need to be treated as well, 
including cats, dogs, and other rabbits.
 
Frontline, which is commonly used for dogs, should never be used on rabbits. 
Advantage, Program, and Revolution are considered safe flea treatments for 
rabbits if applied in conjunction with the advice of a veterinarian.
Flies
Flies just annoy people, but they can be dangerous for your rabbit, especially 
an outdoor rabbit (another great reason to cohabitate with yours indoors). 
Some species of flies like to lay their eggs on the rectal area of a rabbit, 
especially if the area is moist and dirty. (See Chapter 7 for information on 
keeping your rabbit clean and well groomed.) Flies also like to plant their eggs 
on open sores anywhere on a rabbit’s body. The resulting maggots burrow into 
the rabbit and feed on her flesh — disgusting (and painful), for sure.

155
 Chapter 9: Nipping Common Health Problems in the Bud
 
You can keep flies from doing their dirty business on your rabbit by 
 
✓ Making sure that both your rabbit and her outdoor digs (pen, run, and 
so on) are clean.
 
✓ Checking around your rabbit’s rectal area and keeping it clean and dry. 
Keeping the rectal area clean is especially important if you have a long-
hair rabbit because feces, trapped in the long wool, attract flies.
 
Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice
 
✓ Fly eggs and/or maggots on your rabbit
 
✓ Matted fur
 
✓ Wet, irritated skin
To kill the fly larvae, your vet needs to treat your rabbit by removing the 
larvae and dead tissue from your rabbit. Your veterinarian then prescribes 
supportive treatments to help with healing.
 
One species of fly known as Cuterebra lays a single egg, often in the neck 
area where the skin is thinner. The egg hatches, and the single larva takes up 
residence under the skin in a snug little pocket where it continues to grow. 
Eventually, an oblong lump with a small hole becomes visible on the rabbit’s 
skin; this is the larva’s breathing hole. When the larva is mature, it enlarges the 
breathing hole, emerges, and drops to the ground. There it forms a pupa and 
hatches into an adult fly. Do not try to remove this larva by yourself because 
if it ruptures inside the sac, it can release dangerous toxins into the rabbit’s 
system. Your vet can easily remove it with a minor surgical procedure.
Encephalitozoonosis
Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a nasty protozoan parasite that can disable your 
bunny. Encephalitozoonosis is shed through the urine and can be passed 
along to other rabbits who come into contact with infected urine. This trans-
mission most likely happens between a doe and her babies around the time 
of weaning. Mother rabbits can also pass the parasite along to their babies 
through the placenta.
This disease affects the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, heart, and possibly other 
organs of the rabbit. Its effects on the brain and spinal cord can cause the 
rabbit to develop
 
✓ Head tilt and clumsiness
 
✓ Inability to use the hind legs
 
✓ Wobbling when walking

156
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Encephalitozoonosis is difficult to diagnose, and there is currently no cure. 
Usually, by the time the signs are present, the parasite has done its damage. 
Keeping infected rabbits away from healthy bunnies is important. The good 
news is that many rabbits exposed to this disease never develop any prob-
lems. Rabbits who are best able to keep disease at bay are those that are well 
cared for and stress-free.
Baylisascaris
 
Baylisascaris, a roundworm transmitted through raccoon feces, is more likely 
to affect bunnies who spend time in outdoor areas frequented by raccoons. 
When the raccoon leaves its droppings, usually on logs, decks, and the like, 
they contain roundworm eggs. If your bunny is exposed to raccoon feces in 
the backyard or in contaminated hay, she can ingest the eggs, which then 
hatch into larva (baby roundworms). The larvae migrate to various areas of 
the rabbit’s body, including the brain, where they cause inflammation and 
tissue damage.
The signs of infection with this parasite include
 
✓ Abdominal pain
 
✓ Blindness
 
✓ Head tilt
 
✓ Loss of muscle coordination
 
✓ Paralysis of one or both sides of the body
 
✓ Sudden lethargy
 
✓ Coma
 
✓ Sudden death
 
This disease is difficult to diagnose because it can mimic other diseases. Your 
vet can perform a variety of tests to try to pinpoint the problem. Some rabbits 
recover from mild cases, while others may have permanent neurological 
damage. Antiparasitic drugs are ineffective against this parasite. The best 
way to avoid this disease is to avoid areas that are visited by raccoons.

f you’re reading this book, you clearly care about your rabbit and want to 
do right by him. The healthcare guidelines offered in Chapter 9 prepare 
those who love and live with rabbits to spot, treat, and even prevent a host 
of common ailments. This chapter tackles infectious diseases, chronic health 
problems, and health issues associated with aging rabbits.
Rabbit rescue groups are filled with folks who care for rabbits with a whole 
range of health problems — whether from an injury, illness, a chronic condi-
tion, or aging. Their stories are plentiful and inspirational, and this chapter 
looks at the challenges and joys associated with caring for a special needs or 
disabled bunny.
When your rabbit is ready to pass on, you may suddenly have to make an 
incredibly difficult decision. Whether to keep your rabbit alive or euthanize 
your pet to spare her more suffering is one of the hardest decisions you will 
ever have to make. Whether their death is untimely or the result of old age, 
letting go of your rabbit so that you can go on to love again in their memory 
is important.
Treating Infectious Diseases
The best defense against all diseases is a good, healthy immune system. 
Help your rabbit achieve this state of health with the proper environment 
(Chapter 5) and diet (Chapter 6).

158
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
This section talks about some of the diseases that can be transmitted from 
rabbit to rabbit. Several microorganisms (germs) can cause these diseases, 
which vary in severity and how well they respond to treatment:
 
✓ Bacteria: One-celled microorganisms that can often be killed with 
antibiotics.
 
✓ Protozoa: A single-celled microorganism that’s the smallest form of 
animal life. The treatment for protozoal infections depends on what 
tissue in the rabbit’s body they’ve invaded. Some tissues can be easily 
medicated, while others are nearly impossible to treat.
 
✓ Fungi: A multicellular organism that reproduces by budding or by spore 
production. Several kinds of medications treat fungal infections.
 
If your rabbit is diagnosed with an infectious disease, or you suspect that he 
may have one, be sure to
 
✓ Isolate him immediately from other rabbits.
 
✓ Disinfect everything with a solution that’s nine parts water and one part 
bleach (especially before another rabbit uses his cage, food bowl, or 
other items).
Respiratory infections
 
Rabbits can develop several different respiratory diseases that can affect the 
upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses, trachea) and the lower respiratory tract 
(lower airways and lungs). The common term for upper respiratory infections 
is snuffle, which a number of different organisms can cause. Conditions that 
make a rabbit more susceptible include a dirty environment, particularly one 
that’s wet, poor air circulation, and high humidity or heat. Many types of bac-
teria can cause respiratory disease in rabbits, but the two most common are 
Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocid, which may share symptoms. 
Rabbits may also develop other problems, such as heart disease or chest 
tumors, that can mimic some respiratory disease signs. The appearance of any 
of the following symptoms is a good reason to see a vet, who will want to per-
form tests to find out the organism involved and the level of seriousness:
 
✓ Sneezing and nasal discharge
 
✓ Matted fur on inside of the front legs (from wiping nasal discharge)
 
✓ Labored breathing
 
✓ Lethargy

159
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Head tilt or head shaking
Bordetellosis
The Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria causes a condition known as kennel 
cough in dogs, but can also affect rabbits. It’s transmitted through the air. The 
incidence of infection with this bacteria increases as the rabbit ages. Not only 
can this bacteria cause its own damage to the air passageways, including irrita-
tion to the nasal passages, bronchi, and lungs (pneumonia), but it can make it 
easier for other bacteria, such as Pasteurella multocida, to take hold.
 
Rabbits displaying signs of respiratory disease should get veterinary atten-
tion as soon as possible. Your vet may do a culture to determine the cause of 
the infection and a chest X-ray to see the extent of disease. Because borde-
tellosis is a highly contagious disease, your pet should be isolated from other 
rabbits. Guinea pigs in particular are susceptible to developing pneumonia 
from infections with Bordetella, so don’t house them with rabbits. Also, if 
your pet dog is diagnosed with kennel cough, keep him far away from your 
bunnies until he’s healed.
Pasteurellosis
Pasteurella multocida is a bacteria found in the respiratory tract of many 
rabbits without any outward signs. There are many strains, some more prone 
to cause disease than others. In addition, this bacteria can take hold if the 
environmental conditions are poor or the rabbit’s immune system is compro-
mised. Usually it causes upper respiratory disease (infecting the nose, trachea, 
and bronchi), but it can on occasion cause ear infections, pneumonia, and 
abscesses in any area of the body. Like Bordetella, it’s transmitted primarily 
by direct contact with infected objects and through the air when an infected 
rabbit coughs or sneezes.
 
Rabbits transmit the Pasteurella bacteria to each other via sneezing or direct 
contact, so keep affected rabbits away from the healthy ones. If you see your 
rabbit sneezing or coughing, contact your vet right away. As with bordetellosis, 
your vet may do a culture to determine the cause of the disease and an X-ray to 
determine its extent before devising a treatment plan.
Ringworm
Ringworm is the common name for a disease caused by one of several fungi 
that can affect rabbits, people, cats, dogs, horses, and other animals. The dis-
ease is also known as dermatophytosis. Ringworm isn’t a common disease in 
rabbits, but it can occur in young rabbits or those exposed to other 

160
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
animals with the disease. The disease is transmitted by contact with the 
fungi’s spores, which can travel through the air and stay active in the envi-
ronment for long periods. The common signs are
 
✓ Dry, crusty skin
 
✓ Itchiness
 
✓ Fur loss in a circular patches, usually on the head, feet, and legs
Some rabbits can recover from ringworm on their own, but the fungus stays 
in the environment to infect other rabbits, other pets, and even people. After 
your veterinary makes the diagnosis, your pet may be treated with both topi-
cal and oral medications, and you need to clean the environment thoroughly.
 
Disinfecting the rabbit’s environment — cleaning the cage with a diluted bleach 
and water solution to remove hair and dander that may contain spores — is 
important, especially if your rabbit has ringworm.
Myxomatosis
 
Myxomatosis is a disease caused by several strains of poxvirus. Insects serve 
as transmitters. This virus was spread intentionally in Europe during the 19th 
century to destroy large rabbit populations, which were considered vermin at 
the time.
The disease still exists in Europe today in both wild and domestic rabbits. In 
its most severe form, myxomatosis can be fatal. The United States tends to 
see a milder form of the disease, particularly along the California and Oregon 
coast. It’s suspected that mosquitoes are the carriers in those areas. The ver-
sion of myxomatosis seen most often in both wild and domestic rabbits in the 
United States is the appearance of skin tumors, particularly on the extremi-
ties. Occasionally, though, the more severe form can also be seen. The symp-
toms to look for are
 
✓ Fever
 
✓ Lethargy
 
✓ Discharge from eyes
 
✓ Swollen, red genitals
 
✓ Red, swollen, and watery eyes
 
✓ Facial swelling (occurs last)
 
A variety of different insects can transmit the disease. If you live in an area of 
Europe where the disease is found in wild rabbits, keep your pet rabbit indoors. 
If you live in a high-risk area, ask your veterinarian about the possibility of 
vaccinating your pet.

161
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
 
If your rabbit shows any signs of the disease, contact your veterinarian imme-
diately. If your vet makes a diagnosis of myxomatosis, your vet will give your 
rabbit appropriate supportive care (primarily intravenous feeding and fluids) 
in the hopes that the bunny can fight off the virus on its own; in some cases, 
euthanasia may be recommended to prevent suffering and further spread of 
the disease.
Tyzzer’s disease
 
A bacteria called Clostridium piliforme causes Tyzzer’s disease. Depression and 
profuse, watery diarrhea are symptoms of Tyzzer’s. This disease can be fatal, 
particularly in rabbits that were recently weaned. Older rabbits with this ill-
ness may develop a chronic wasting disease, where the rabbit refuses to eat 
and slowly wastes away.
A low-fiber, high-carbohydrate diet, along with poor hygiene and stress, can 
predispose a rabbit to Tyzzer’s disease. If your rabbit shows signs of depres-
sion and diarrhea, take him to a veterinarian right away. The most important 
part of treatment is a high-fiber, low-carbohydrate diet.
Venereal disease
A venereal disease is one spread through sexual contact. Rabbits develop a 
form of syphilis caused by a bacteria, but it’s not the same disease as seen in 
humans.
Rabbits transmit syphilis through breeding (another good reason to spay and 
neuter; see Chapter 9). If you do have a good reason to breed your rabbit, 
you need to take precautions to keep your rabbit from contracting syphilis: 
Inspect the genitals, lips, nose, chin, and eyelids of the rabbit with which you 
intend to breed your pet. Although an inspection won’t guarantee that your 
rabbit won’t come into contact with the disease, it certainly reduces your 
rabbit’s chances.
 
Affected rabbits develop crusty sores on their genitals, lips, nose, chin, and 
eyelids. If your rabbit has been bred and develops these symptoms, contact 
your vet right away. Antibiotic treatment is recommended and usually works 
quickly to clear up the problem.
Viral hemorrhagic disease
In 2000, the first case of Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) was diagnosed 
in rabbits in the United States. Since then, this deadly disease has been 

162
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
recorded in several areas of the country, prompting great fear among rabbit 
owners and breeders.
 
Caused by a calici virus, VHD affects 70 to 80 percent of rabbits exposed to 
it, and in rabbits that develop signs of the disease, it’s 100 percent fatal. Oral 
contact with contaminated feces transmits the disease. VHD is also known 
as Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD), Rabbit Calicivirus (RCV), and Rabbit 
Calicivirus Disease (RCD).
VHD affects major organs and causes severe hemorrhaging. The virus has a 
short incubation period (the amount of time an organism needs to become 
numerous enough to cause disease), and rabbits often die within a few days 
of exposure to the disease. The symptoms of VHD can include
 
✓ High fever
 
✓ Lethargy
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Spasms
 
✓ Spontaneous bleeding from the mouth or rectum
 
✓ Sudden death
 
VHD is an insidious disease with no cure. However, a vaccine is available in 
areas of the world where the disease is endemic. The United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) is keeping close watch on the spread of VHD. If your 
rabbit shows VHD symptoms, rush him to a veterinarian immediately. Because 
VHD is a reportable disease, your veterinarian will contact the USDA.
The best prevention is to
 
✓ Keep your rabbit from coming into contact with other groups of domestic 
rabbits. (Keep a new rabbit separated for at least 30 days to ensure that 
he’s healthy before you expose him to your other rabbits.)
 
✓ Avoid using grooming tools, cages, and other objects that strange 
rabbits have used.
 
✓ Wash your hands and clothes after handling rabbits at a show, shelter, 
or rabbitry.
The good news is that because death occurs so soon after the onset of the 
disease, rabbit owners are thus immediately alerted to its presence. If action 
is taken right away, then you can at least minimize the spread of the disease 
between rabbitries.

163
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
Encephalitozoon cuniculi
A protozoan parasite, Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) can cause a host 
of health problems in rabbits, among them kidney failure and liver failure, 
head tilt, loss of function in the legs, as well as other neurological problems. 
The parasite forms spores that are shed in urine, which the rabbit then 
inhales or ingests. Once inside, E. cuniculi travels through the body, affecting 
the kidney and other organs.
E. cuniculi is diagnosed by a blood test. Although a large number of rabbits 
throughout the United States test positive at some time during their life, few 
show signs of illness. (Those rabbits who do are typically ones whose health 
is already compromised.)
Caring for Disabled and 
Special Needs Rabbits
There’s no getting around the fact that caring for a special needs or disabled 
rabbit is a big commitment, but one with big rewards. Whether your rabbit 
has become disabled from age or illness, you love him all the same. But it’s 
worth preparing yourself for the time, effort, and emotional commitment 
necessary to care for a rabbit with special needs. Every situation is different, 
so only you can evaluate yours; living with a partially paralyzed bunny is not 
the same as living with a bunny with dental issues that needs a special diet. 
Consider the following:
 
✓ Do you or someone in your family have the time to care for your 
disabled bunny?
 
✓ Is your rabbit in pain? Is she eating? Keep in mind that you’ve made this 
commitment for your rabbit and not yourself. Be realistic about what is 
best for your rabbit.
Antibiotics are anti-bunny?
Antibiotics are one reason taking your bunny to 
a veterinarian who specializes in rabbits is so 
important. Some antibiotics commonly given to 
dogs and cats (like oral amoxicillin) can be fatal 
for rabbits. These drugs can kill off the healthy 
bacteria in a rabbit’s GI tract as well as the 
bacteria causing disease. This disruption can 
lead to enteritis. However, many safe antibiot-
ics can be used in rabbits orally, topically (on 
the skin), or by injection. An experienced veteri-
narian will know which type is safe to use.

164
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Those that have made the choice to care for a special needs or disabled 
bunny will have to make certain modifications:
 
✓ Home renovation: If you’re using a cage as part of your housing arrange-
ment, think about getting rid of it altogether so that it’s easier for your 
rabbit to move around.
 
✓ Bedtime: Be sure your rabbit has a comfortable bed that he can access. 
Add some layers of blankets or soft towels to make his bed extra plush 
and cozy.
 
✓ Bunny business: Make sure that your rabbit can still get into his litter 
box. If the sides are too high, consider cutting out an entrance on one 
side. If a litter box is out of the question, consider absorbent “puppy 
pads” or going the route of diapers; many caretakers find diapers can be 
useful. (Look for Web sites that offer advice on taking this approach.)
 
✓ Sitting pretty: Some disabled rabbits may have trouble keeping up with 
grooming. Lend a hand with extra brushing and take care to ensure that 
her hind end stays clean and tidy. (See Chapter 7 for more on the right 
way to groom and bathe a bunny.)
 
✓ Pedicure time: Keep up with your rabbit’s nail clipping, and be sure that 
no sores have developed on the bottoms of your bun’s feet.
 
✓ Nourishment needs: A special needs rabbit may require extra help with 
eating; some may even need the addition of a high-fiber liquid hay sup-
plement, such as Critical Care, or syringe feeding. Monitor the amount of 
liquid your rabbit is taking in to be sure that he’s properly hydrated.
 
✓ Comfort level: Keep a careful eye on your rabbit’s comfort (see 
Chapter 9) to be sure that he’s not in pain.
 
✓ Keeping company: A calm, older rabbit may provide an extra dose of 
what your special bunny needs: companionship and affection.
 
✓ Support: Ask for help from friends and family when you need it; check 
out some of the online support groups.
Taking an alternative approach to treatment
More and more people are turning to alter-
native healthcare for themselves, and some 
believe such approaches can work equally well 
for rabbits. Though your vet may not be familiar 
with acupuncture and acupressure, chiroprac-
tic care, and herbal remedies, these treatments 
may complement conventional veterinary med-
icine. Many of these holistic approaches are 
reported to have few side effects. However, 
consult with your vet before embarking along 
an alternative path to treatment.

165
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
Helping Bunny Live to a Ripe, Old Age
With the right care, your rabbit can live to be 10 years of age or even older. 
And of course, the better the care is that you give to your pet, the healthier 
he’ll be in his old age. (See the rest of Part II for information on how to pro-
vide the best basic care for your pet.)
However, rabbits, just like people, start to develop some problems as they 
age. If you have a senior bunny in the house, watch out in particular for signs 
of the following:
 
✓ Kidney disease: Though not exclusively a problem associated with age, 
kidney disease occurs most often in older rabbits. Symptoms include 
weight loss, excessive water consumption, and excessive amounts of 
urine. (See Chapter 9 for more information.)
 
✓ Arthritis: Your older rabbit may develop arthritis, which can make it 
difficult to hop around and get onto his favorite spot on your Lazy Boy. 
Speak with your veterinarian to see whether medication to fight inflam-
mation and pain is warranted.
 
✓ Sore hocks: Older buns, especially those who are obese or less mobile, 
are prone to calluses, sores, or even abscesses on their hocks (see 
Chapter 9).
 
✓ Hind leg weakness: An older rabbit may experience weakness in his 
legs, which can make getting up from a seated or reclining position more 
difficult.
 
✓ Dental disease: Dental disease includes incisor and/or molar malocclu-
sion, tooth root abnormalities, and abscesses. (For more on abscesses 
and dental problems, see Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Blindness: Loss of vision can be caused by a number of reasons. 
Cataracts, for example, are a natural sign of aging, but glaucoma is a 
painful condition that should be treated. A veterinary exam is in order if 
you suspect changes in your rabbit’s eyesight.
 
✓ Deafness: Many rabbit folks report loss of hearing in older rabbits. 
A deaf bunny needs no special care, but she will appreciate it if you 
approach her in a way that she can see you at a distance first so that she 
isn’t startled.
 
✓ Cancer: Cancer can strike at any age, and older rabbits are not immune 
to this often devastating diagnosis. Aside from the preventable uterine 
cancer (see Chapter 9), rabbits fall victim to a number of other cancers, 
including lymphoma, which can develop anywhere in the body. Early 
detection, along with options that include surgery and chemotherapy, is 
critical.

166
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
Making some adaptations to his environment can make life easier for your 
older bunny:
 
✓ Be especially careful to give him a good, healthy diet (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Cut down the side of his litter box to give him easier access.
 
✓ Lower his hay rack and water bottle.
 
✓ Provide him with plenty of soft places to sit; monitor hocks for calluses 
and see your veterinarian if hocks develop open wounds.
 
✓ Provide him with nonskid surfaces (carpet, sheepskin) to help him if he 
has trouble getting up.
 
✓ Make necessary modifications to make sure that your older rabbit is 
warm enough.
 
✓ Protect your blind or sight-impaired rabbit by keeping him in a safe 
living area.
 
✓ Reduce stress in his environment as much as you can.
Saying Goodbye
The hardest part of having a rabbit in your life is saying goodbye when your 
pet’s final moment comes. Rabbits have a way of hopping into your heart 
and then you feel a tremendous sense of loss when you no longer have your 
bunny to hug and hold.
If you’re lucky, your beloved rabbit will live to a ripe old age and won’t leave 
until it’s truly her time to go. However, illness or injury may take a rabbit 
away from her human companions prematurely. If your rabbit is ill and strug-
gling with illness and/or incapacity, you may be forced to consider euthaniz-
ing your rabbit. If so, then consider the following:
 
✓ Find out more about what euthanasia is and what it involves.
 
✓ Consider your rabbit’s quality of life.
 
✓ Talk with your vet.
Letting go: Euthanasia
 
Understanding exactly what euthanasia is can help you decide whether to take 
this route with your pet. Basically, euthanasia is the humane process of taking 
an animal’s life. Veterinarians use a barbiturate (a drug that depresses the ner-
vous system), which they inject in large quantities into a rabbit’s bloodstream. 

167
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
The drug ceases brain function almost immediately; thus, the rabbit loses 
consciousness, stops breathing, and her heartbeat ceases.
If you ever had a dog or cat euthanized, it may be helpful to know that the 
process is somewhat different for rabbits. For dogs and cats, a catheter (a 
needle that can be attached to a tube or syringe) is usually placed in the ani-
mal’s vein while the dog or cat is still awake. The euthanasia solution is then 
administered. For rabbits and other small exotic pets, the catheter can’t be 
placed unless the animal is heavily sedated. In rabbits that are sick or small, 
it can be difficult to place the catheter at all.
For this reason, veterinarians opt to sedate the rabbit first with a small injec-
tion in the muscle or with an inhalant anesthesia (an inhaled gas that sedates 
the rabbit). When the pet is no longer conscious, the euthanasia solution is 
administered via another injection. If the animal is sick or small, injecting the 
solution into the vein may not be possible. In these cases, the injection may 
have to be given directly into the heart or abdomen.
 
Although the thought of euthanasia can be upsetting, remember that the 
rabbit is already sedated and therefore can’t feel anything. The rabbit isn’t 
even aware of the injection. Rabbits feel no pain during the euthanasia pro-
cess. From what scientists now know, rabbits don’t experience fear when 
they’re slipping away either, but instead, just a quiet sense of falling into a 
deep sleep.
If you find yourself in the position of asking a veterinarian to euthanize your 
rabbit, you can ask for sedation if the vet doesn’t normally provide it. The 
sedative reduces any fear that your rabbit may have of being handled by the 
veterinarian and will result in a more peaceful euthanizing process.
 
Some people prefer the option of having their pet euthanized at home, particu-
larly if it’s difficult for them or their pet to travel. Check with your veterinarian 
to see whether he offers an at-home euthanasia service or call a veterinarian 
who specializes in house-call service.
Considering her quality of life
If you find yourself struggling with this difficult decision, remember that 
euthanasia can be a great gift to a rabbit who is suffering and beyond help. 
Without you to make the decision to let your rabbit go painlessly, your rabbit 
would suffer needlessly.
Think about your rabbit’s quality of life and whether it’s fair to keep her alive 
in her condition. Do you think that she’d welcome a peaceful, quiet death?
 
Consider the following questions to help determine your rabbit’s quality of life:
 
✓ Is she able to move around comfortably?
 
✓ Does she still enjoy eating?

168
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
✓ Can she comfortably relieve herself?
 
✓ Does she respond to you when you try to interact with her, or does she 
seem tired or withdrawn?
 
✓ Can she still take part in the activities that she enjoys?
 
✓ Does she experience more pleasure than pain in her life?
If your answer is no to a number of these questions, you have to come to 
terms with the fact that your bunny’s quality of life isn’t what it used to be.
 
Making the decision to euthanize a pet is extremely difficult. After you do, 
you’ll probably experience all kinds of unpleasant emotions and plenty of 
doubt, too. You can read more about emotions and how to deal with them 
in the “Grieving is Good for You” section, later in this chapter. Most people 
aren’t often in the position of making life and death decisions and having to 
decide to have their rabbit euthanized.
Asking a pro
When it comes to making a decision about whether to put down your ailing 
rabbit, your veterinarian is a valuable resource. She can give you a good idea 
of how much pain your rabbit is experiencing and what the likelihood of 
curing or managing your rabbit’s condition may be. After hearing your vet’s 
opinion, you’re then able to make an educated decision about how to handle 
your pet’s future.
If you’re uncertain about the medical aspects of the decision, getting a second 
opinion from another veterinarian is also helpful. You can get a second opinion 
from a vet in the same practice or in another clinic.
Should you stay?
When you make the decision to euthanize your 
rabbit (whether you take him to the vet or the 
vet comes to your home), your vet may ask you 
whether you’d like to stay with your pet during 
the process. Choosing whether to be with your 
pet in her final hour is a personal decision, and 
one that only you can make. If your rabbit is 
sedated (which is highly recommended), your 
bunny won’t even know that you’re present. 
However, being at your pet’s side at his final 
moment may provide you with comfort.
However, if you feel that you can’t handle being 
present when your rabbit dies, you aren’t obli-
gated to stay nor do you need to feel guilty about 
leaving the room. Remembering to take care of 
your own feelings is important when you’re in 
this situation. Do what feels right for you.

169
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
 
The decision is ultimately yours; do whatever makes you the most comfort-
able in the long run. Don’t let anyone push you into a decision that you don’t 
feel right about or that you aren’t ready to make. Take a few days to think it 
over before you decide. Don’t feel that you have to make a rush to judgment. 
If your pet is uncomfortable, ask your vet for suggestions on how to make her 
more comfortable, including using pain medication.
In the event that your decision needs to be made immediately, take a few 
minutes to sit by yourself and think about the situation or talk to a support-
ive loved one or friend. Feeling right about your decision is important, even if 
it has to be made sooner than you’d like.
Finding a place of rest
 
Everyone has different feelings about how to handle the remains of their beloved 
rabbit. Planning what you’ll do with your pet’s remains well in advance is a 
good idea so that you don’t have to make this sometimes difficult decision 
when you’re feeling badly about just having lost your pet.
You have several options when it comes to dealing with your bunny’s remains:
 
✓ Individual burial: You probably heard of pet cemeteries and may have 
even seen one as you’re driving. For a fee of several hundred dollars, 
your bunny may be interred at a pet cemetery. A headstone or grave 
marker is usually included in the fee. By giving your pet a marked grave, 
you can visit your bunny whenever you like.
 
✓ Communal burial: Most pet cemeteries provide the option of a com-
munal burial, which is more affordable. With this method, your rabbit is 
interred with other pets (sometimes cremated) at the pet cemetery in an 
unmarked grave.
 
✓ Individual cremation: Some rabbit owners choose the option of indi-
vidual cremation. Then they place their bunny’s cremated remains in a 
container for burial or in an urn that they keep at home. Keeping your 
pet’s ashes at home is less expensive than a burial.
 
✓ Group cremation: For a lesser fee, your rabbit may be cremated with 
other deceased pets and buried in a communal grave at the cemetery.
 
✓ Disposal by a veterinarian: All vets offer to dispose of your pet’s body 
after euthanasia. Depending on the clinic, group cremation or other 
means of disposal are used.
 
✓ Burial at home: If your county or municipality allows it, you can bury 
your rabbit at home on your property. Consult your local zoning laws 
before you take this route to make sure that burying your pet on your 
own property is legal where you live.

Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
Grieving is good for you
People who haven’t loved and lost a rabbit are often shocked at how devas-
tated they feel when their bunny dies. They hadn’t imagined they could feel 
such grief over an animal. Many people who have lost pets say that the level 
of their sadness matches feelings they had when they lost a family member 
or loved one. The intense grief that someone may feel at the loss of a pet 
doesn’t diminish the value of the beloved family member but instead makes a 
rabbit owner realize just how much attachment she had for her rabbit.
Your thinking processes won’t be rational while you’re grieving the loss of 
your pet. If you had your rabbit euthanized, you may feel as if you did some-
thing terrible; if she died naturally, you may feel as if you let her go. All those 
who grieve go through stages.
All of grief is a stage
When you lose someone you love, whether you lose a loved one or a pet, you 
experience a number of emotions. Grieving is a process with several distinct 
stages:
 
✓ Denial: “I can’t believe it.”
 
✓ Bargaining: “If I had only done this or that, she’d have lived.”
 
✓ Anger: “This is so unfair!”
 
✓ Depression: “I’m never going to have a pet again. No more pets.”
 
✓ Acceptance: “I did the right thing. It was her time to go, and I loved my 
rabbit while she was here.”
Postmortems
It’s unpleasant to think about your bunny under-
going a postmortem examination (also known 
as necropsy, it’s an internal examination of the 
organs and tissue performed by a veterinarian 
after the rabbit has died). However, if you lose 
your beloved rabbit to illness or you don’t know 
the cause, think about having your vet perform 
a postmortem.
The reason for this is simple: By helping your 
veterinarian learn about the problem that took 
your rabbit, you’re contributing to your vet-
erinarian’s knowledge of rabbit medicine. This 
information can help your vet successfully treat 
other rabbits in the future and may actually save 
lives. In addition, if you have other rabbits in the 
household, you can find out whether the condi-
tion that caused the death puts your other rab-
bits at risk. Chapter 14 offers more information 
about how to deal with a rabbit’s loss.

171
 Chapter 10: Coping with Other Health Woes and Aging Issues
 
These feelings can come in any order, at any time, and can often repeat them-
selves in a period of an hour, a day, or a week. You may also feel other senti-
ments. The grieving process is unique to each person and there is no “right” 
way to grieve. It’s important to
 
✓ Understand that these emotions and more are part of the normal 
grieving process.
 
✓ Be aware of why you’re feeling these things.
 
✓ Talk to someone who’s sympathetic. The Appendix in this book has grief 
resources.
 
✓ Know that in time, if you allow yourself to go through this process, the 
intensity of the emotions and pain lessen, and you’ll enjoy life again. 
Avoiding and ignoring your feelings won’t stop the process, but only 
delay it and make recovering more difficult.
Finding support
Sometimes, finding a sympathetic ear when you’re grieving the loss of your 
pet is difficult. People who don’t care much for rabbits or who never had a 
pet tell you to just “Get over it,” or “Go buy a new one,” or ask you “What’s 
the big deal?”
 
At this time of grieving, try surrounding yourself with other like-minded 
people who understand what you’re going through. Limit your discussions of 
sadness over your pet’s loss to friends and family members who can relate 
to what you’re feeling. Keep in mind that everyone grieves differently. Don’t 
expect members of your family to act and feel the same way that you do over 
your rabbit’s death.
 
If you can’t find anyone sympathetic to talk to, help is available. Over the 
past several years, a number of veterinary schools have set up grief counsel-
ing hotlines for rabbit lovers and other pet owners who have lost a beloved 
animal. (See the Appendix for a listing of these hotlines.) Make use of these 
services and contact other rabbit owner groups. They’ll help you work 
through the grieving process and help you recover from your loss. Local pet-
loss support groups meet regularly in many areas. Your veterinarian can pro-
vide information on local groups.
Bonding with a new bunny
Just after losing your rabbit, the last thing you want to do is get another. The 
pain is too strong. You need time to heal.

172
Par t II: Taking Care of Creature Comforts 
 
After going through the initial loss, some people find that opening their home 
to a new rabbit can help with healing. Doing so is scary because it feels like 
you’re setting yourself up for more pain in the future. However, if you’re 
ready for this step, providing a good home to a rabbit in need can return your 
thoughts to the joys of rabbit companionship again. The affection that you 
shared with your first rabbit was so wonderful, that you’re anxious to feel that 
warmth again — this time with your new bunny.
If you feel like getting a new bunny, consider it. If not, don’t feel obligated 
or pressured to get another rabbit or any other pet. The decision is purely 
yours. Your new rabbit won’t be a replacement of your old pet but a new 
companion to enjoy. For some people, giving a home to a rabbit in need is a 
wonderful way to honor their deceased pet.
In memory of Fluffy
One way of feeling better after losing a beloved 
rabbit is to honor your pet’s memory. You can 
do this in any number of ways:
 ✓ Make a donation. One of the nicest ways 
to honor your rabbit’s memory is to make a 
donation to a rabbit rescue group. You don’t 
have to make a huge donation. An organi-
zation that works hard to provide homes to 
unwanted bunnies will appreciate the $5 or 
$10 that you sent. Contact your veterinar-
ian, local animal shelter, or House Rabbit 
Society (see the Appendix for contact info) 
to locate a rabbit rescue group in your area. 
Be sure to include a note with your check, 
stating that the donation is in honor of your 
rabbit’s memory.
 ✓ Discuss your rabbit. A number of Web sites 
are set up to help grieving pet owners talk 
about their feelings and honor their pet’s 
memories with poems, essays, and photos. 
(See the Appendix and Chapter 19.)
 ✓ Create something. Writing your feelings 
about your rabbit on paper can help you 
work through the grief while also honor-
ing your rabbit’s memory. You don’t have 
to show your words to anyone. They can 
be just for you and your rabbit, or you can 
choose to share them with other rabbit 
owners on the Internet or through a rabbit 
club. If you’re artistic in some way, you 
may find it more comfortable to express 
your feelings through drawing, painting, 
sculpting, or through another type of art. 
Perhaps you’d like to paint a portrait of your 
deceased pet from a photograph. Consider 
making a photo album for your pet, too. A 
great way to honor your rabbit’s memory 
and cope during the grieving process is to 
make a photo album.
 ✓ Volunteer. Rabbit rescue organizations 
need plenty of help. Consider donating your 
time, energy, or special services to one of 
these groups in your pet’s honor. (See the 
Appendix for more information on volunteer 
rabbit groups.)
 ✓ Adopt a bunny. It may sound a bit strange 
at first, and it’s certainly not for everyone, 
but a wonderful way to honor your rabbit’s 
memory is to provide a home for a bunny in 
desperate need of love. Knowing that your 
rabbit’s passing provided an opportunity for 
a rabbit who really needed a home can help 
you overcome your grief, putting your rab-
bit’s life in a truly positive light.

Chapter 11
Thinking Like a Rabbit
In This Chapter
▶ Communicating with your rabbit
▶ Discovering the rabbit mind
▶ Pairing rabbits with others
O
n the surface, rabbits may seem like simple creatures who just want to 
eat, sleep, and play, but they’re actually much more complicated than 
that. You don’t survive as a species for millions of years if you don’t have 
much going for you besides the basics.
Rabbits are excellent at reading humans’ body language, communicating 
silently (and quite loudly), and figuring out what has changed and why. 
They’re also experts at detecting danger. If you want to communicate effec-
tively and live harmoniously with your domestic bunny, take heed of the fol-
lowing bunny wisdom.
Making Sense of Body Language
Communication is the key to the success of any good relationship. You and 
your rabbit are no exception. Although your bunny may seem a bit quiet, she 
has many ways of communicating her needs.
The first step in communicating with your rabbit is being able to figure out 
what the heck he’s trying to tell you. For the most part, rabbits speak with 
their bodies. They talk to each other and to you through their movements 
and postures.
 
To understand what your rabbit is saying to you, you need to pay close 
attention. Observe your pet in different situations to recognize the following:
 
✓ Chinning: “This is my turf.” When your rabbit rubs his chin on the 
corners of furniture, on his nest box, or on your hand, he’s marking 
his territory by chinning. The scent glands located on the underside of 

176
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
his face leave an odor detectable to other rabbits (not humans), letting 
them know that this territory belongs to the owner of the scent. Let your 
rabbit chin all he wants because it makes him feel safe.
 
✓ Hopping, leaping, and racing: “Whoopee! I’m happy!” Bunnies express 
pleasure this way with many variations and levels of difficulty.
 
✓ Binky-ing: “It’s hard to describe how happy I am!” The binky, a high 
jump coupled with vigorous twists, is the unmistakable sign of a very 
happy rabbit.
 
✓ Kicking: “Let go!” or “What fun!” If you’re holding your rabbit and he 
starts to kick violently, he’s letting you know that you aren’t holding 
him in a way that helps him feel secure. (Chapter 7 tells you how to hold 
your rabbit properly so that you can avoid this type of language.) You 
may also see your rabbit kick when playing. Kicking when playing is dif-
ferent than kicking when feeling insecure and basically means “Yippee, 
I’m having fun!”
 
✓ Circling: “I’m in the mood for love.” A rabbit who circles your feet is in 
courting mode or may also be just trying to get your attention.
 
✓ Flattening: “I don’t want you to see me.” In the wild, rabbits are masters 
of camouflage. They can flatten their bodies and blend in with the brush 
to avoid being seen by predators. Pet rabbits flatten, too. If your rabbit 
gets nervous when being approached by someone he doesn’t know or 
by another animal, he’s likely to lower himself to the ground in a behav-
ior called flattening. He holds his ears tightly against his head, and his 
eyes bulge out, as shown in Figure 11-1. In this position, your rabbit is 
trying to tell you that he’s scared. Remove him from whatever situation 
is frightening him and let him know that everything is okay.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The 
squatter’s 
on the top, 
the flattener 
on the 
bottom.
 

177
 Chapter 11: Thinking Like a Rabbit
 
✓ Squatting: “I’m comfortable and secure.” Flattening and squatting are 
polar opposites. Flattening expresses fear, whereas squatting expresses 
comfort. Rabbits who are squatting (also see Figure 11-1) have a distinctly 
more relaxed appearance. Their muscles don’t appear to be tight, their 
ears aren’t held tightly against their heads, and they have a relaxed 
expression.
 
✓ Stretching out: “Ah, what a life. . . .” A rabbit lying on his side with his 
legs extended is feeling relaxed and secure. A variation on this position 
is when a rabbit lays on his stomach with his legs stretched out behind 
him. And the ultimate in relaxation? The flop, when a rabbit sprawls on 
his back.
 
✓ Ear shaking: “Ick, I don’t like that.” If your rabbit gets a whiff or taste of 
something he doesn’t like or if he wants you to leave him alone, he may 
give his ears a good shake to let you know what he’s thinking. Ear shak-
ing indicates that your rabbit isn’t happy at the moment.
 
 Frequent ear shaking can be a sign of a medical problem and should be 
assessed by a veterinarian. Chapters 9 and 10 detail other health 
problems and their potential signs.
 
✓ Head butting: “Hey!” A persistent rabbit will head-butt you when she 
wants something — petting, food, whatever.
 
✓ Stomping: “Warning” or, maybe, “I’m annoyed.” If you saw the movie 
Bambi, you probably remember a little rabbit named Thumper, who got 
his name by repeatedly stamping his back leg on the ground. Thumper 
wasn’t just displaying cartoon behavior. Real-life rabbits thump their 
hind legs on the ground to issue warnings, too. If you see your rabbit 
thumping, he’s probably alerting you to danger or to something else 
that’s going on.
 
✓ Biting: “I don’t like what you’re doing.” A gentle nip is a rabbit’s way of 
saying “Okay, I’ve had enough.” A bite is different (and you’ll be able 
to tell when you get your first real chomp) and is usually the result of 
fear or anger. Unless the biting is chronic and painful, give your rabbit a 
break from whatever you’re doing. (Chapter 13 gives training tips.)
 
✓ Sitting up tall: “I’m curious,” or “Is there trouble afoot?” An inquisitive 
rabbit will rear up on her hind end to look around. A frightened rabbit, 
on the other hand, may rear up and prepare to bite.
 
✓ Licking: “I love you.” If your rabbit kisses you in the form of a lick on the 
hand or face, he’s telling you that he loves you. Rabbits usually reserve 
this show of affection for each other, but special humans are also graced 
with rabbit kisses on a none-too-infrequent basis.

178
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
Interpreting Rabbit Sounds
 
Although rabbits primarily communicate with body language, they also have 
the ability to make sounds. You may hear your rabbit make some of the 
following sounds:
 
✓ Purring: Like a cat, a rabbit purrs when content. Unlike the feline purr, 
however, the rabbit purr comes not from the throat but from the teeth.
 
✓ Humming: “I’m in the mood for love.” You’re likely to hear this sound 
mainly from those male rabbits that are still sexually intact.
 
✓ Clucking: This sound is the rabbit version of “Oh, that was yummy!” A 
rabbit cluck sounds sort of like the cluck of a chicken, but very faint.
 
✓ Whimpering: Rabbits who want to be left alone sometimes whimper 
in hopes that you won’t pick them up. Pregnant females are especially 
likely to make this sound.
 
✓ Tooth grinding: You may hear two types of tooth grinding:
 
• Loud grinding: He’s in pain. Get your rabbit to a vet right away.
 
• Soft grinding: He’s expressing happiness.
 
✓ Hissing: Your rabbit may make this sound in response to another rabbit. 
Hissing is an aggressive sound that basically sends the message “Take 
another step, and you’re toast!”
 
✓ Snorting and growling: An angry rabbit snorts and/or growls at who-
ever has made him mad. In most cases, this behavior is reserved for 
other rabbits that are perceived as a threat of some kind. A bite or 
charge usually follows the sounds of snorting and growling, so if it’s 
directed at you, get out of the way!
 
✓ Screaming: You never want to hear this sound. When a rabbit is truly 
terrified for its life, it lets out a scream that is almost humanlike.
Preying for Safety
Of course, it helps to put rabbit body language and vocalization into context. 
Exactly how do rabbits think? What goes on in those fuzzy little heads?
When trying to understand rabbit psychology, you need to realize that rab-
bits are prey (versus predatory) animals. They’re close to the bottom of the 
food chain, so they basically exist to provide meals for other animals. Their 
lot in life of being a primary dinner source for other animals has made a sig-
nificant impact on the rabbit’s collective personality.

179
 Chapter 11: Thinking Like a Rabbit
Imagine that you’re always being hunted. Everyone wants to make a meal out 
of you. Does this idea make you a bit paranoid? We would think so. Now think 
about how rabbits must see the world. Although they somehow manage to 
enjoy life, they’re always waiting for some big scary creature to make a play 
for them. The result? A very wary creature with quick reflexes and a strong 
propensity to run first and ask questions later.
 
If you want to live with a rabbit, you need to realize how much the prey men-
tality factors into her personality. Rabbits are surprisingly happy-go-lucky, 
despite their lot in life, but they’re always on the lookout.
Don’t assume that just because your rabbit is cuddling with you one minute 
that he won’t suddenly be afraid of you the next. If you’ve ever watched 
nature documentaries on TV, you’ve no doubt noticed that zebra herds will 
calmly graze within close vicinity to a lounging pride of lions. The zebra seem 
to have no fear of the lions because the lions aren’t acting like predators at 
that moment. But the minute the lions start making quick, aggressive move-
ments, the zebra heads go up, and the herd heads out.
 
It’s the same thing with your rabbit. Human companions must work hard not 
to be mistaken for predators. If you’re calm and friendly, your rabbit sees 
you as friend. If you’re loud and making fast, aggressive moves, your rabbit 
becomes afraid of you, thinking that you’ve turned into a hungry predator.
Showing Others Who’s Boss
In this book, you see mentioned time and again the rabbit’s penchant for 
being a social creature. In fact, without this aspect of the rabbit’s disposition, 
rabbits wouldn’t be the terrific pets you’ve grown to know and love.
 
When left to their own devices, rabbits live in complex social groups with a 
distinct hierarchy. A king buck and queen doe rule the colony’s warren (a series 
of dens and tunnels) with a collective iron paw, and more submissive bunnies 
play different roles within the group. In the case of domesticated rabbits, these 
rules of hierarchy are applied to humans, fellow domesticated rabbits, and 
even other household pets. An example of a dominant and submissive rabbit 
is shown in Figure 11-2. And just as within the world of wild rabbits, different 
bunny personalities exist in captivity that determine which rabbits will be king 
and queen and which will be subjects.
To understand this relationship, think about human beings. Some people 
are naturally more assertive than others. Some are natural leaders, but others 
prefer to follow. Individual personalities ultimately determine where a person 
ends up in life, and the same goes for rabbits. The tougher, more assertive
rabbits rise to the top of the pecking order, while the ones with meeker 
personalities take a more subservient role.

180
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
 
Figure 11-2: 
The domi-
nant stance 
is shown in 
the rabbit 
on top; the 
submissive 
rabbit is the 
one on the 
bottom. 
 
It won’t take you long to figure out what kind of rabbit personality you’re deal-
ing with. If you have a rabbit who’s on the bossy side, always nipping at you 
to get out of the way or pushing your other pets around, you have a bunny 
who would probably be the king of the warren had he been born a wild rabbit 
instead of a domestic one. On the other hand, if you have a quiet, gentle soul 
who complies easily, never gets aggressive, and seems a bit on the timid side, 
you have a rabbit who’d happily let others rule were he a wild rabbit living in 
the social hierarchy of a colony.
Either type of rabbit — and all those in between — have much to offer. 
Assertive rabbits can be entertaining to live with, but the softer personality 
types surely steal your heart.
Coexisting Peacefully: Ensuring 
a Happy Homecoming
When the time comes to bring your bunny home, take care to make the expe-
rience as stress free as possible:
 
✓ Ticket to ride. Most rabbits do fine during short car trips, but it’s not likely 
to be your rabbit’s favorite activity. Chapter 16 outlines ways of creating a 
secure and comfortable carriage ride for your rabbit.
 
✓ Digging in. Make your rabbit feel welcome and relaxed by being prepared 
for his arrival ahead of time, with cage and supplies set up, rabbit-proofing 
complete, and food ready to go. Put his cage in a quiet spot; he’ll prob-
ably appreciate some alone time in his nest box. Try not to startle your 
rabbit with any sudden movements or loud noises and certainly wait 

181
 Chapter 11: Thinking Like a Rabbit
a while before bringing other pets around. (See the upcoming section 
“Meeting Fido and Fluffy.”) Chapter 2 covers how to introduce a new rabbit 
to your home’s current rabbit residents.
 
✓ Meeting the family. Talk to other members of your household (the 
humans, that is!) about what will be happening and how your rabbit is 
likely to feel. In particular, caution children about giving the rabbit time to 
get used to his new home. This chapter covers introducing new bunnies 
to children in the upcoming section “Combining Children and Rabbits.”).
 
Your rabbit is dealing with a big change. Be patient and give him time to 
adjust; the process often takes a week or more. Be calm but friendly, and your 
companion will soon give you signs that she’s settling in.
Gaining Your Rabbit’s Trust
Because of their natural prey instinct, trust can be hard to come by in a 
rabbit. If you want your rabbit to see you as a friend and not a foe, you need 
to act more like a rabbit than a predator. (See the earlier section “Preying for 
Safety.”) Getting into your rabbit’s mind and viewing the world from his per-
spective can help you become more “rabbit-like.” To gain your rabbit’s trust, 
convince him that you have no intention of turning him into a meal.
 
To help gain and deepen your rabbit’s trust in you, have patience and take the 
following steps:
 
✓ Speak softly. When you’re around your rabbit, talk in a quiet, gentle 
voice. You can talk and coo to your bunny all you like, but do it at a low 
volume in a soft and nonmenacing way.
 
✓ Move slowly. Quick, jerky movements are the movements of hungry 
predators. Move slowly and deliberately when you’re around your 
rabbit. And whatever you do, don’t chase your rabbit. If your bunny is 
being resistant about being caught, try luring him to you with a favorite 
treat. If you run after your rabbit, you’ll suddenly seem like a predator 
with something unpleasant on your mind.
 
✓ Feed at the right times. Rabbits tend to prefer eating in the early morn-
ing hours and at dusk because they’re the safest times to avoid preda-
tors. By giving your rabbit his main meals at these times of the day, you 
help cater to his instinctual need to eat at a safe time, which makes for a 
more generally relaxed rabbit. (Chapter 6 talks about food.)
 
✓ Never use harsh discipline. Rabbits don’t understand harsh discipline, 
and bunnies interpret any kind of yelling or striking to be the maneuvers 
of an enemy. Use positive reinforcement to teach your rabbit how to 
behave. You can get help in Chapters 12 and 13.

182
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
Meeting Fido and Fluffy
One of the neatest characteristics of rabbits is their propensity to get along 
with other pets. They’re genetically programmed to find a way to live with 
others — even if those others are members of a different species.
Of course, the rabbit’s status as a prey animal puts it in an awkward posi-
tion when trying to get along with other domestic animals. When considering 
other pets, think about the same pairing in the wild. Would your canary take 
on your bunny? Probably not, so the two should be fine supervised at home. 
Same for hamsters and the like.
 
Parrots and ferrets, however, can be a challenge. Even though rabbits and 
these animals don’t have a history of animosity toward each other, aggres-
sive parrots should be kept away from rabbits, which isn’t too difficult to do. 
Ferrets, on the other hand, are likely to want to make a meal out of a rabbit 
and so are best kept at a safe distance.
Although cats and rabbits have been on opposite sides of the chase for a long 
time, most cats and rabbits are virtually the same size, and no cat in its right 
mind would take on an average-size rabbit. Dogs are the greatest challenge 
because their wild relatives considered rabbits a prime source of food. In 
fact, if you research the history of dogs and rabbits, you can see that the dog 
and the rabbit have long had a strained relationship, as far back as the Ice 
Age. If you have a dog or a cat, take note of the tips in the following sections 
on determining whether your pets can get along.
Dogs
If you have a dog and plan to get a rabbit, you need to take care. Most dogs 
have a strong instinct to chase and even kill rabbits, and some have gotten 
into the habit of running after wild rabbits in an attempt to annihilate them. 
If you’re going to keep both of these species as pets, stay constantly aware of 
this inherent tension between the two creatures.
 
Think about your dog’s
 
✓ Personality: Is your pooch a mellow old coach potato who’s hard 
pressed to chase or get excited? Or is she a more active dog?
 
✓ Age: Older, calmer dogs usually do better with rabbits and are less likely 
to harass them. If your dog is young and you can reliably control her, it 
may work out, providing, of course, that you’ve set up a controlled, safe 
environment for such a meeting. But if your dog ignores you when you 
call her, you have a problem on your hands.

183
 Chapter 11: Thinking Like a Rabbit
 
✓ Breed: Many terriers, some types of hounds, and a number of other 
breeds have been bred for hundreds of years to hunt rabbits. If your dog 
comes from one of these hunting breeds, one look at your new rabbit 
can trigger previously dormant hunting instincts in your dog. Unless you 
have a young puppy — preferably less than 6 months old — training 
your dog of a hunting-type breed not to harm the rabbit is going to be 
tough; breeds known for their hunting prowess include beagles, hounds, 
retrievers, and terriers, to name a few.
 
Before even attempting to introduce a rabbit to your household, take your dog 
to obedience training. Obedience training helps your dog listen to you and 
respect you as an authority. This recognition of you as the pack leader can 
enable you to show your dog not to harm a rabbit.
After you decide that your dog is controlled enough to officially meet your 
rabbit, and your rabbit has had time to get used to his new home, follow 
these steps to introduce the two:
 
1. Put your dog on a leash and put someone the dog respects in control 
of the leash (an adult only).
 
2. Allow the dog to approach the rabbit’s cage slowly, in a quiet manner.
 
 If the dog starts to act up, correct him by saying “No” and quickly jerk-
ing the leash. Do this reprimand consistently.
 
3. When the dog approaches the rabbit quietly, even for a moment, 
praise him with pats and verbal kudos.
 
Your rabbit will probably be scared the first time that she sees your dog and 
is likely to hide in her nest box. Hiding is a good way for the rabbit to feel 
secure when the dog’s around. If the dog is calm and nonthreatening, the 
rabbit will probably become braver, even curious. You know that the rabbit is 
curious if the bunny comes out of her nest box when the dog is around. When 
the rabbit seems comfortable with the dog and the dog is calm and quiet 
around the rabbit, you can assume that the two have reached a truce.
 
Don’t assume that just because your dog seems disinterested in the rabbit 
that you can safely let the two loose together. Your dog can never be trusted 
with the rabbit. Don’t take chances with your rabbit’s life. Keep your dog and 
your rabbit separated by a cage or other barrier at all times. Some dogs, no 
matter how hard their owners try, can’t avoid chasing a rabbit. Their preda-
tory instincts are simply too strong. In these cases, you have to keep the dog 
permanently separated from the rabbit or find a safer home for your rabbit.

184
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
Cats
Although dogs and rabbits are often a tricky combination, cats aren’t usually 
a problem when it comes to cohabiting with a rabbit. Even though cats are 
predators and may be inclined to chase rabbits, they’re less capable of doing 
damage. It’s rare that a cat will be so aggressive toward a rabbit that the two 
can’t be housemates, especially if the rabbit is a large one. On the flipside, 
some rabbits are so bossy that they make life miserable for kitties.
 
You can get a good sense of how your cat and rabbit behave toward each 
other when you introduce them. If your cat begins to stalk your rabbit and 
treats it like prey, don’t allow the two together unless your cat is on a harness 
and leash, as shown in Figure 11-3. If your rabbit is the same size or larger 
than your cat, let the cat approach your rabbit and permit the rabbit to put 
the cat in his place. Your rabbit will probably try to bite and kick your cat, and 
you can be sure that your cat will never attempt to stalk the rabbit again.

If you have one of the smaller breeds of rabbits or a baby bunny, take care if 
you have a cat who wants to stalk your rabbit. Make sure to keep the two sepa-
rated at all times because your cat may actually be able to do some harm to a 
smaller bunny. (You can read more about breeds in Chapter 3.)
Follow these steps to safely introduce your cat and your rabbit:
 
1. Trim your cat’s claws using a nail clipper.
 
 If your cat’s nails are trimmed, he’s less likely to be able to scratch your 
rabbit should he decide to take a swipe at your bunny. If you aren’t sure 
how to do trim your cat’s nails, see the nail trimming section in Chapter 7. 
Cat nails are trimmed essentially the same way as a rabbit’s.

 Chapter 11: Thinking Like a Rabbit
 
2. Begin the introduction with the rabbit in her cage.
 
 No need for the cat to wear a harness during this stage. Your cat and 
rabbit will probably stare at each other and seem nervous. That’s 
because they are! Your rabbit may dive into the nest box, and your cat 
may arch his back and even hiss — all normal behavior.
 
3. If your cat approaches the rabbit slowly and isn’t aggressive, reward 
the kitty with praise and a treat.
 
 If your cat hisses and runs away, ignore him. Eventually, your cat’s curi-
osity will get the best of him, and he’ll come back to take a closer look. 
In time, your cat will get used to the rabbit. Should he get too interested 
and stick his paw through the bars of the rabbit’s cage, squirt the cat 
with a water pistol from a distance, which sends a message to your kitty 
that aggression toward the rabbit is not okay.
 
 When the cat and rabbit start to take each other’s presence for granted, 
you can move to the next step: face-to-face introduction.
 
4. Let your rabbit out of her cage in a rabbit-proof room.
 
 See Chapter 5 for more on rabbit-proofing.
 
5. Put your cat in a harness with a leash attached and let him be in the 
same room with the rabbit, while you’re holding the leash.
 
 Keep the cat in place and allow him to watch the rabbit hop around the 
room. When the rabbit hops, the cat may make moves toward her as 
if to chase her. Don’t allow this. Instead, keep the cat still and let him 
watch the rabbit move around the room.
 
 If your rabbit behaves aggressively toward your cat, let your cat run 
away from the rabbit. If your cat feels cornered, it may attack in self-
defense. If your rabbit continues to behave aggressively toward the cat, 
the cat finds out that he needs to stay away from the rabbit, which is 
fine. Your rabbit should be allowed to call the shots in this situation. In 
the unlikely event that your rabbit starts seeking out your cat just so 
that she can attack the poor feline, you can discipline your rabbit with a 
squirt of water to the body and a firm “No!”
 
6. Repeat these sessions regularly until both your cat and your rabbit 
are comfortable with each other.
 
 It will probably take time before the two start to ignore each other (or 
even become friends), but it’s worth the effort.

Combining Children and Rabbits
Children and bunnies are an adorable combination. The sight of a youngster 
cuddling a cute rabbit is almost too much to bear. But in order to keep both 
creatures safe in each other’s company, parents need to be aware of poten-
tial problems.
Rabbits fascinate kids. Whether it’s those giant ears or nonthreatening 
demeanor that attracts them, children tend to become obsessed with their 
bunnies. If you have a kid or two and a rabbit, your children will no doubt 
spend plenty of time with the rabbit, which is fine as long as you keep the fol-
lowing in mind:
 
✓ Children must be taught how to handle a rabbit properly. Carefully 
supervise any time children spend with your rabbit. Show the child how 
to pet a rabbit on the floor — gently, with the back of their hand — and 
teach them not to chase or harass a rabbit.
 
✓ Set lifting limitations. Young children shouldn’t be permitted to lift 
a rabbit because both child and rabbit may get hurt in this situation. 
Older children (8 years and up) may lift smaller rabbits safely, as long as 
they’re taught the proper technique (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Let your kids know that rabbits have sensitive ears and don’t like loud 
noises. Teach them to keep loud play to a minimum when they’re in the 
vicinity of the rabbit. When kids are feeling rambunctious and want to 
scream and run around, they should do it outside or at least in a differ-
ent room from where the rabbit is kept.
 
✓ Rabbits need their quiet time. Unlike most dogs, rabbits aren’t always 
up for playing. Teach your kids to give the rabbit some space. If you need 
to, set aside a section of the day as the rabbit’s quiet time when no one is 
allowed to bother him.
 
✓ Children enjoy feeding time with rabbits in particular. Let your children 
feed treats or dinner to your bunny, but show your children that they 
should sit quietly if they want to watch bunny dine. The rabbit shouldn’t 
be touched or disturbed while eating.

Putting Boxing Gloves on 
Your Rabbit: Training
In This Chapter
▶ Putting yourself into practice first
▶ Employing treat tactics
▶ Responding to your commands
Yes. You can train your rabbit, both for fun and to help you control some 
of his behaviors. Of course, you can’t train them to sniff for drugs, guide 
the blind, or roll over on command, but you can train them to take actions that 
are appropriate for rabbits. For example, you can show a rabbit how to use a 
litter box, follow a few basic commands, and behave somewhat properly in the 
company of human companions. It’s a matter of understanding your bunny — 
what he likes and dislikes, what motivates him, how to keep him interested — 
and going from there.
Although this chapter covers general training tactics, it focuses on positive 
behaviors (“tricks,” if you consider sitting up a trick). Chapter 13 describes 
how to use training techniques to tackle common behavioral problems.
Training Your Bunny the Right Way
No matter how bright your bunny is, though, he isn’t going to get very far 
training himself. This is where you come in. As with many other companion 
animals, real training success depends on a great trainer.
Following these general rules is important when training a rabbit to respond 
to a command:
 
✓ Take the time to bond. Know that your rabbit trusts you before you 
attempt any kind of training. In other words, your rabbit must trust you 
before she’ll be able to listen to you.

188
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
 
✓ Train your rabbit in a quiet safe place. Your bunny needs to be able to 
concentrate on you.
 
✓ Be consistent. Always use the same command; don’t change or add 
words. If you want to teach your rabbit to jump up on the couch and 
want “hop up” to be your command, always use that phrase when you 
ask him to come up.
 
✓ Use rewards. Give your rabbit his reward immediately after he executes 
the command. The best rewards for rabbits are food treats. (See Chapter 
6 for details on healthy food treats for rabbits.)
 
✓ Be firm. Don’t give your bunny the treat if he doesn’t follow the com-
mand. Doing so only encourages him to ignore you. Be firm, but not 
harsh.
 
✓ Be kind. Never use physical discipline with a rabbit. They’re too fragile, 
and it only destroys the trust you’ve worked so hard to build.
 
✓ Be patient. If your bunny is having trouble catching on, figure out another 
way to teach him. Never use harsh words or punishment of any kind.
 
✓ Go back to square one if you need to. If you’re having success with 
your rabbit’s training but then hit an impasse, your rabbit needs a 
refresher course. Go back to square one and start the training process 
all over again.
 
✓ Keep training sessions short. Take no more than ten minutes at a time 
and always end on a positive note. In other words, stop right after your 
rabbit does it right, not after he does it wrong or gets tired or frustrated.
 
Training a rabbit can take as little as a few days or as long as several weeks, 
depending on the rabbit and what you’re trying to teach him. Any rabbit that 
is old enough to interact with you is old enough to train. Even senior bunnies 
can learn new tricks.
Giving a Command Performance
Training a rabbit is not like training a dog. Dogs are socialized to humans and 
are anxious to be accepted. Rabbits, on the other hand, hop to a different 
drummer. Even though rabbits are creatures that like company as well, they 
aren’t as closely bonded to humans as dogs are, and obeying your every com-
mand is down low on their list of priorities. (When that fact of life becomes a 
real problem, refer to Chapter 13 for more behavioral information.)
 
When training, use short sessions of no more than five to ten minutes at a time; 
rabbits have short attention spans. Save one trick for each training session. In 
fact, it’s a good idea to teach your rabbit one thing at a time so that he doesn’t 
get confused. For example, once your rabbit knows to come on command, you 
can move on to jumping on command.

189
 Chapter 12: Put ting Boxing Gloves on Your Rabbit: Training
Using treats and praise, you can convince a rabbit to follow a few select com-
mands and even perform a few cute behaviors to impress your friends.
Training with treats
To inspire your rabbit during training, you need to understand what motivates 
her. Unlike dogs, these long-eared companions aren’t naturally motivated to 
please their humans. Rabbits do, however, respond to particular incentives — 
food treats, mostly — and tasty treats typically play an important role in train-
ing. Keep the following in mind when using treats as a tactic in training:
 
✓ Figure out your rabbit’s favorite treats. Chapter 6 talks in detail about 
smart food choices for rabbits, but remember that fresh greens and 
veggies, with occasional fruits, are the best options. Packaged gourmet 
rabbit treats have too many calories to offer in any quality or frequency. 
Check with your vet if you’re not sure about a particular food.
 
✓ Treats should be given immediately after your rabbit performs the 
requested action. The goal is to associate the action with the reward.
 
✓ Reward your bunny with treats until he consistently and correctly 
responds to the command. Once your rabbit has mastered a skill, you 
can begin to wean him off the treats. The idea is to be able to give the 
command without having to use treats at all. Consider, too, the role of 
petting and toys as rewards.
 
 Wean your rabbit away from the treat gradually — one time, she gets the 
treat, the next time, she doesn’t. Soon, all you’ll have to do is say the 
command.
 
✓ Never withhold food from your rabbit to make him hungry for train-
ing. Fresh hay and clean water should always be available.
 
✓ Don’t overfeed your rabbit by using treats during training sessions! 
The overuse of treats during training can lead to an overfed, perhaps 
overweight, bunny.
Here, Fluffy: Coming when called
If you let your rabbit run in a large area of the house, you may want her to 
come when you call her name. Coming when called allows you to find your 
rabbit if she’s hiding, and you’re concerned for her welfare.
You can train rabbits to come when you call them, provided that you always 
give them a good reward when they do what you ask.

190
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
 
The best way to get a rabbit to come when you call him is to find out what his 
favorite treat is. Whether it’s a piece of tomato or a chunk of melon, use this 
as your lure. (Chapter 6 gives you more ideas on what a good treat entails.)
To train your rabbit to come when called:
 
1. Get down on the floor close to your rabbit.
 
2. Offer the treat.
 
3. Using your rabbit’s name, say, “Come!”
 
 Your rabbit will see or smell the treat and will come toward you to get it. 
She doesn’t know that you called her because she hasn’t figured out this 
part yet. However, if you repeat this routine over and over, she’ll start to 
associate hearing you call her name and “Come!” with getting her favor-
ite treat.
 
4. After your bunny consistently comes to you from this close distance, 
start to work from farther away.
 
 Instead of being so close, squat several feet away from your pet. Offer 
out the food and call your rabbit’s name and “Come!”
Some rabbits catch on more quickly than others, but within a few weeks, 
your rabbit should come to you just about every time that you call her. You 
may even be able to get her to come to you from another room.
Making like Van Halen: Jumping
 
Another fun behavior that you can drill is jumping up on a piece of upholstered 
furniture on command. (Unupholstered furniture can be too slippery!) Of 
course, that’s if you want your rabbit on the couch. If you’d rather bunny keep 
all four paws on the floor, you may want to skip this one.
To train your bunny to jump up on the couch on command:
 
1. Hold the treat on the couch when your rabbit is having her free time 
in the house and is hopping around on the floor.
 
2. When she approaches the couch, make sure that she sees the treat.
 
 You can hold the treat in a spot where she can reach it just by standing 
on her hind legs with her front paws on the couch cushions.
 
3. Using your rabbit’s name, say, “Hop up!”
 
 Or if you prefer, just pat the top of the couch with your other hand 
as a signal.

191
 Chapter 12: Put ting Boxing Gloves on Your Rabbit: Training
 
4. Even though she’s on her hind legs at the edge of the couch and hasn’t 
jumped up on the couch, give her the treat so that she associates a 
treat with the couch.
 
5. When Fluffy responds to you without fail, hold the treat farther back 
onto the couch.
 
 That way, your rabbit has to really reach to get the morsel.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5.
 
 Eventually, your rabbit will jump up on the couch to get the treat, pro-
vided it’s not too high for her. If it is, you may want to skip this trick or 
provide a small stool for your rabbit to hop up on to make her way to 
the couch.
 
 Make sure that you’ve given the command just before your rabbit makes 
her attempt to get the morsel. You want her to associate hearing her 
name and “Hop up!” or a hand patting the couch with the action of 
coming on the couch and getting the treat.
 
7. When your rabbit finally jumps up on the couch, gently praise her and 
scratch her on her favorite spot while letting her dine on her reward.
Eventually, you can eliminate the treat because the command or a pat on the 
cushion should be enough to get your rabbit to join you on the couch.
 
Your rabbit can jump down alone. Helping her might be more detrimental!
Working on the abs: Sitting up
Another good trick (and one that will impress visitors) is sitting up on com-
mand. This trick is pretty easy because rabbits naturally sit up on their hind 
legs all the time.
To teach your rabbit to sit up on command:
 
1. When your rabbit has all four feet on the floor, put your hand above 
her head with the treat in your fingers.
 
2. Using your rabbit’s name, say,“Sit up!”
 
3. When your rabbit rises up on her hind legs to get the treat, give her 
the treat along with some verbal praise.
After your rabbit rises up consistently in response to your command, start 
eliminating the treats.
Depending on your rabbit, it can take anywhere from just a few training 
sessions to a couple of weeks before she’s trained to sit up on command.

192
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
Cozying up in his cage: Go in
You can train your rabbit to go into his cage or into his travel carrier on com-
mand. (If you want to train your rabbit to go into his travel carrier, make sure 
that he’s already comfortable with being inside it. See Chapter 16 for details 
on how to make your rabbit feel okay about being in his travel carrier.) This 
trick can be handy because it will spare you the trouble of pursuing your 
bunny when you want to put him away for the night or in his carrier for a trip 
to the vet.
 
You should train for this behavior at times when you don’t need to have your 
rabbit in his cage for a trip or bedtime, which allows for more flexibility in the 
training process.
To train your rabbit to go into his cage or carrier:
 
1. Put your bunny close to the opening of his cage or travel carrier.
 
2. Say “Go in!” and lure your rabbit into the opening by placing his 
favorite treat inside the cage.
 
 Make sure that your rabbit sees that you have put the treat inside.
 
3. After your rabbit is inside the cage or carrier, give him the treat.
After your rabbit gets the idea, you can place the treat in the carrier and then 
say “Go in!”
 
If your rabbit doesn’t go in and retrieve the treat after you give the command, 
don’t put him inside or give him a treat anyway. He needs to associate getting 
the treat with actually going into the cage or carrier.
Taking a walk on the wild side
Do you have a bold bunny who likes to explore new places? Take your rabbit 
to a safe place, such as a friend’s fenced backyard. You can walk your rabbit 
on a leash that’s attached to a harness. A harness restrains the pet around 
the chest and shoulders, instead of by the neck, as a collar would. (Chapter 
11 shows an example of such a harness..) A harness is a good way to take 
your rabbit outside while still having control over him.
When taking your bunny on a walk, keep these pointers in mind:
 
✓ Don’t use a collar on a rabbit because your rabbit’s neck can be 
seriously injured if your pet resists.

193
 Chapter 12: Put ting Boxing Gloves on Your Rabbit: Training
 
✓ Be careful about where you walk your rabbit. Dogs and disease are two 
serious dangers that rabbits can encounter in unprotected areas.
 
✓ Most rabbits are uncomfortable in strange surroundings and may not 
enjoy outings to new places.
Adjusting to the harness
Before going for a walk, your rabbit first must get used to having his harness on.
 
Don’t leave the harness on for long periods of time because a rabbit can chew 
it off, ingesting the pieces of leather, plastic, or metal belt buckle and causing 
intestinal obstructions.
To adjust your rabbit’s harness:
 
1. Buy a harness.
 
 You can get a cat harness at your local pet-supply store or one espe-
cially made for a rabbit from a catalog or Internet retailer.
 
2. Put the harness on the floor near your rabbit when he’s hopping 
around.
 
 Let your rabbit get used to seeing the harness.
 
3. Place some treats around the harness to encourage him to get close to it.
 
 This step helps him associate the harness with treats and to realize that 
the harness is harmless.
 
4. Lay the harness gently on your rabbit’s back to get him used to the 
feel of it.
 
 You don’t want to actually put it on him or buckle it at this point. The 
idea is to let him adjust to the weight of it on his back before you put it 
on him.
 
5. When your rabbit seems comfortable having the harness on his body, 
buckle it on him and let him hop around the house under supervision.
 
6. After your rabbit seems at ease wearing the harness, snap a leash on 
to it and walk around the house with him.
 
 If your rabbit panics when wearing the harness, go back to square one 
and start getting him used to it all over again. Don’t leave the harness on 
when not using it, as the rabbit will probably chew it off.
On the walkabout
When your rabbit is comfortably walking in his harness indoors, try taking 
him outside. Although you can let him explore your backyard or take him to 
a friend’s house on lead, don’t walk your rabbit around the neighborhood or 
anywhere unprotected by a fence.

194
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
 
After you have the leash on the harness, it’s important to remember that
 
✓ Rabbits can’t be taught to heel or do most of what leash-trained dogs do. 
Instead, your rabbit will hop around, and you’ll basically follow.
 
✓ Be gentle with your rabbit while walking him. If you need to get from one 
place to another while he’s on the leash, pick him up and carry him.
 
✓ Take care not to allow him to eat any unknown plants or walk through 
areas that may have been sprayed with pesticides or visited by dogs.
 
✓ Your pet is vulnerable when he’s outside of his home. You need to keep 
a close watch for loose dogs who can attack your pet. (If you see a dog 
approaching your rabbit, pick your rabbit up and hope the dog doesn’t 
try to snatch him out of your arms. Consider carrying pepper spray to 
protect your rabbit from an attacking dog.) Also, never leave your rabbit 
unattended or tied up because he could become tangled in his leash and 
might panic.

Chapter 13
Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding your bunny’s misbehavior
▶ Saying “No!” to biting, chewing, and fighting
▶ Changing your little devil into an angel
N
o pet is absolutely perfect, and rabbits don’t wear wings either. Despite 
their innocent appearance, rabbits can be terribly naughty and nasty, 
but that doesn’t mean that your “bad” bunny has to hold you hostage.
Though the word “No!” may have its place in training, in order to handle a 
bad bunny, you must first understand what’s driving the bunny to do what 
she’s doing and redirect her in a different direction. (For more on thinking 
like a rabbit, see Chapter 11.)
If you realize that your rabbit doesn’t think or see the world the same way 
you do, being patient with him is easier. Then you can work on changing his 
behavior. For example, he doesn’t recognize that certain objects have value 
or that urine smells bad to people. When your rabbit acts in a manner that 
you find offensive or unpleasant, he’s only acting upon his rabbit instincts 
and learned behavior from living in a household. Many behaviors that owners 
classify as problem behaviors — chewing and digging, for example — are 
really quite normal and can be linked back to their wild ancestors’ lifestyles.
Take the time to understand why your rabbit is misbehaving, have patience, 
and apply the knowledge you gain from this chapter. You may be surprised at 
how successfully you can turn your mischievous bunny into a real sweetheart.
Just Say “No!”
By saying “No!” to your rabbit, you can train many rabbits to quit undesir-
able behaviors. Training your rabbit to respond to this verbal command is 
an invaluable part of managing negative behavior, especially if your rabbit 
is about to do something that may harm him. If your bunny is chewing on 

196
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
an electrical cord, stealing some of the cat’s food, or getting into some other 
kind of trouble, you can say “No!” to get your pet to stop it immediately.
To train your rabbit to respond when you say “No!”:
 
1. Catch your rabbit in the act.
 
2. When you see your rabbit doing something he shouldn’t, clap your 
hands loudly and say “No!”
 
 The sound should startle him enough to stop the behavior.
 
3. If your rabbit doesn’t stop when you clap and say “No!”, use a squirt 
gun or spray bottle to squirt water at him immediately afterward.
 
 Aim for his body, not his head or face.
 
4. Repeat these steps as necessary.
Rabbits don’t like being squirted with water, and after going through the 
preceding steps a few times, he’ll start to catch on that “No!” is followed by a 
shower. Soon enough, you’ll only have to say “No!” to get your rabbit to stop 
whatever he’s doing. You can then retire the spray bottle or squirt gun.
Taming Terrible Teenagers
Just about every species of mammal has its adolescent years, and rabbits 
are no exception. Like human teenagers, rabbit “teens,” which are typically 
around 5 to 12 months, are coping with raging hormones, newfound indepen-
dence, and moving from youth into adulthood. And just like human teenag-
ers, rabbit adolescents feel the need to test their boundaries to see what they 
can do. They’re trying to establish their social order within the group, and 
because humans are part of the “group,” they’re included in the aggressive, 
“testing” behavior. This behavior is normal and healthy.
 
Teenage bunnies tend to be mischievous, sassy, and even a bit hard to handle. 
Spaying or neutering before the behaviors become deeply entrenched can pro-
vide some measure of relief for the situation, as can a bucket load of patience. 
(Chapter 9 talks more about the benefits of spaying and neutering.) Just keep 
reminding yourself that like your child, your rabbit will indeed grow out of 
this phase. Some people even manage to find some humor along the way. You 
should also
 
✓ Set the stage for success: Take extra care with rabbit-proofing at this 
stage. The measures you took to protect your home and your older 
bunny from harm may not be enough for a rambunctious teen rabbit. 
Think, too, about changing or limiting where and when a teenager has 

197
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
his freedom (similar to allowing a human teen to drive to her grand-
mother’s during the day but not to a party with her friends at night). For 
a rabbit, you may allow a lot of time in a cozy hallway and bathroom, but 
not so much time in the office, where the cords and books live!
 
✓ Outsmart and reroute: With any rabbit, but teenagers in particular, you’re 
not likely to be able to stop a behavior like chewing or digging. Instead, 
figure out ways your rabbit can take care of these natural urges without 
wreaking havoc on the household. Giving him ten acceptable things to 
chew may be the trick to keeping him from chewing the two things that 
actually matter to you (your oak baseboards and antique wicker chair).
 
At all times, it’s important to handle misbehaving bunnies properly during this 
period. Rough handling can cause irreparable damage to the bond you have 
with your pet.
Coping with Aggressiveness
Not all rabbits are bossy, but more dominant bunnies behave this way 
toward human and rabbit companions. If your rabbit is an adolescent or 
hasn’t been spayed or neutered, your pet may behave aggressively. Rabbits 
can demonstrate aggression in various ways — for example, lunging and 
biting, which are discussed later in this chapter.
Not all rabbits are inclined to get aggressive, some more dominant bunnies 
can start behaving this way toward human companions. An adolescent bunny 
or a bunny that hasn’t been neutered or spayed can exhibit aggressive behav-
ior. Most bossy bunnies are either
 
✓ Adolescents finding their way in the hierarchy of the household (and 
trying out the dominance theme). Read more on sassy rabbits in the 
section “Taming Terrible Teenagers,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Established as dominant. The top-dog status can happen when they’ve 
gone unchallenged during the establishment of dominance. In other 
words, people stopped handling the rabbit during his adolescent testing 
period, so the rabbit learns that he’s at the top on the social heap.
You can gently show a bossy bunny that this behavior is unacceptable. (Not 
sure whether your bunny is being sweet or ornery? Check out Chapter 11 for 
rabbit body language information.)

Biting the Hand That Feeds 
You — Literally
When a rabbit bites you, it hurts. Those incisors are designed to shear off 
pieces of tough plant material, and when they’re directed at human skin, it’s 
pretty darn painful, not to mention just plain upsetting.
 
Rabbit bites rarely break the skin, so you probably won’t have to do much 
to your wound other than lament over it. If your rabbit does make you bleed, 
wash the area with plenty of water and soap and then check with your doctor 
to see whether further medical attention is needed.
Rabbits often bite when they’re
 
✓ Defending their food
 
✓ Asserting dominance
 
✓ Protecting themselves
If your rabbit is a biter, you first need to figure out which of these situations 
you’re dealing with. Then you can figure out how to solve the problem.
Food aggression
In the wild, rabbits must compete with one another for food. Because bunnies 
live in large social groups, someone is always trying to snag the best patch 
of grass. The rabbit who is good at defending his food source is the one most 
likely to survive, especially in the wintertime when food is scarce.
If your rabbit gets nippy when you feed it, you have a rabbit with food aggres-
sion. Understanding this behavior is difficult for people because you’re the 
one giving the rabbit the food in the first place. So why is he attacking you like 
you’re going to take it away from him?
Actually, bunnies are pretty logical. From the bunny’s perspective, food is 
present and so are you, and you may take it away if he doesn’t defend it by 
biting your hand. Also, the fact that your hand places the food down and then 
moves away mimics the actions of another rabbit, who may come in closer to 
investigate a food source and then retreat.
Solving this problem can be tricky because in most cases, it’s a product 
of your rabbit’s inherent personality. However, you can try the following 
actions to thwart this inappropriate rabbit behavior:

199
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
 
✓ Instead of placing your rabbit’s food in the same place every time 
you feed him, place it somewhere else. Relocating his bowl to differ-
ent parts of his hutch, cage, or your home discourages your rabbit from 
viewing his food bowl as being within a specific part of his territory that 
needs defending.
 
✓ Help your rabbit make the connection between the presence of your 
hand and the giving of a food item. Feed him outside of his cage or 
hutch, holding onto a food object while your rabbit eats it. Use a carrot, 
piece of hay, or something long at first so that your hand isn’t in close 
proximity to the bunny’s teeth should he decide to nip you. After your 
rabbit is comfortable routinely eating from your hand, move the proce-
dure to the inside of his cage or hutch and continue it.
 
✓ Place food items all around your rabbit’s cage or hutch so that he 
associates food with being all around — not just in the food bowl. If you 
disperse food in this way, then your rabbit can’t be quite so territorial 
about food that’s spread out.
Dominance
Rabbits are programmed to establish a hierarchy in social groups, and your 
domestic bunny is no exception. Just as with people, some rabbits are more 
aggressive and pushy than others.
If you have a rabbit who nips for no apparent reason, such as when you’re 
watching TV, making dinner (ankles are the usual target), or simply moving 
around in his vicinity, you probably have a dominant biter.
 
The object of the dominant biter is to get you to move over, get out of the way, 
stop whatever you’re doing, or get some food. Recognizing this motivation 
and refraining from rewarding the biter by giving him what he wants is impor-
tant, because rewarding him just reinforces his biting behavior.
Try these approaches to help curb a dominant rabbit’s nips:
 
✓ When the rabbit bites you, let out a screech. Then reach down and gently 
push your rabbit’s head to the floor and hold it there for a couple of 
seconds. This action is rabbit speak for “I’m the dominant one here, not 
you.” Hopefully, your rabbit will get the message over time and stop 
trying to push you around.
 
✓ If your rabbit nips you for food, don’t give him any. Try screeching to 
discourage him and offer him food later on when he’s being nice.
 
✓ If your rabbit keeps biting you and acting obnoxious, put him gently 
into his cage for a time out. He may soon discover that challenging you 
means his freedom is restricted, and he will cease and desist.

Self-defense
Rabbits prefer to use running away as a means of self-protection, but in situa-
tions where they can’t run, they resort to biting, lunging, snorting, or attacking 
(lashing out) with their front feet. If your rabbit bites you when you approach 
him or put your hand in his cage, he’s most likely nipping you out of fear.
 
Consider taking the following actions to alleviate this problem:
 
✓ Avoid approaching your rabbit from below eye level. Placing your 
hand in front of your rabbit’s face to make contact or reaching under his 
face to scratch his chin may be the problem.
 
✓ Reach down into his cage through a top door. If your rabbit bites you 
when you reach into his cage to remove him, he’s reacting defensively 
to your approach. This reaction usually occurs if you reach in through 
a side door in the cage. Instead, reach down into the cage through an 
opening in the top door. Your rabbit is less likely to back into a corner 
and force you to approach from the front if you reach down to get him.
 
✓ Back off from mother-to-be or nursing mother. If you have a pregnant 
doe or one that’s nursing a litter or experiencing a false pregnancy (a 
condition where the rabbit’s hormones make her feel like she’s pregnant, 
when in reality she’s not), you can expect some maternal aggression on her 
part. Your rabbit is attempting to keep you away from her nest (before 
giving birth) or away from her young (after birth). Either way, try to cut 
her a little slack. This behavior is normal and shows that your rabbit is a 
good mother.
Busting Loose: Kicking
Finding a rabbit owner who has never been kicked is hard — it sort of goes 
with the territory. Rabbits most often kick their owners while being held, and 
they do it because they’re trying to escape. (Remember to always provide 
support to your pet’s hindquarters and hold him against your body to pro-
vide the greatest amount of security.)
 
When your rabbit kicks you while you’re carrying him, your pet isn’t deliber-
ately trying to hurt you. Kicking is a rabbit’s way of flailing and trying to get 
his feet underneath him. If your rabbit is repeatedly kicking you when you’re 
carrying him, you’re not handling your pet correctly. See Chapter 7 and work 
on your bunny-carrying skills.

201
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
 
If your rabbit doesn’t kick you but seems to be scratching the heck out of your 
child, then you need to work with your child to help foster his rabbit-carrying 
skills. Remember that young children aren’t strong enough to handle most 
rabbits, so only allow your young children to interact with bunnies while all 
the rabbit’s feet are squarely on the floor.
Boxing Bunnies
Some aggressive rabbits may express their feelings by hitting and otherwise 
threatening, lunging, and growling at their rabbit and human companions 
alike. Doesn’t sound like fun, right? Give your boxing bun an outlet for his 
aggression by providing him with toys that help let out steam. Think “punch-
ing bag for bunnies” and peruse the pet store for toys that you can hang, 
avoiding any plastic toys that he can chew apart and potentially ingest.
The following diversions may also help redirect your rabbit’s propensity to hit:
 
✓ Throwing: Rabbits love throwing balls around; look for wire balls with 
bells in the center for extra excitement.
 
✓ Nudging: Some rabbits get a real kick out of playing with rubber play-
ground balls, which are great for nudging and rolling around the house.
 
✓ Batting: A simple solution may be to hang a bell from a piece of cotton 
string (not a loop, which may catch a rabbit’s head); some rabbits get a 
thrill out of hitting it with their noses.
Though it may take some trial and error, a bit of thought and patience may 
be all it takes to soothe your bunny’s inner beast.
Taming Bandit
Another example of how to deal with an aggres-
sive rabbit comes from Marinell Harriman, an 
experienced house rabbit caregiver. In her 
book House Rabbit Handbook: How to Live with 
an Urban Rabbit (Drollery Press, 2005), she tells 
the story of a bunny named Bandit who was so 
dominant and aggressive that he attacked her 
whenever someone entered the room. Instead 
of punishing him, Harriman’s approach was to 
give Bandit a rub down, brushing (which he 
loved), or scratching behind his ears. Eventually, 
Bandit’s aggressive greetings became loving 
ones, and he would meet people with excite-
ment and bunny kisses.

Chowing Down
Look at those choppers — rabbits are built for chewing. In the wild, rabbits 
chew branches, twigs, and leaves to help grind their teeth down. Without such 
items in your home, your rabbit will look for alternatives, mostly furniture, 
molding, books, carpeting, and cords, — you get the idea. Is this a bad bunny? 
Or just a bunny doing what he’s supposed to do?
Wild rabbits chew on plant material that ranges from abrasive to soft. They 
don’t chew on dead wood because it has little nutritional value. They do strip 
bark off young trees, however, but only because it has nutritional value in the 
living tissue. Both outdoor and indoor pets need to have exercise and healthy 
materials for their teeth. In domestic situations, however, the strong urge to 
chew can create huge problems for both the rabbit and his owner.
 
If you have an indoor rabbit who is making short work of your wooden furni-
ture legs or electrical wires, you have a problem. Fortunately, you can easily 
solve this common problem. To begin, Chapter 5 has information about 
rabbit-proofing, protecting your property, and supervising your pet.
Although you can’t (and shouldn’t!) stop your rabbit from chewing, you can 
redirect her chewing urges. Consider the following:
 
✓ Whenever you see your bunny start to nibble on a forbidden item, quickly 
give her something else to chew, preferably something similar in taste 
and texture. Replacing the forbidden item with an acceptable chew toy 
is key.
I’ve got the TTOUCH
You won’t find many training schools for rab-
bits out there, but if your rabbit has training and 
behavioral issues, you may find a method called 
Tellington-TTOUCH Training helpful. First devel-
oped for horses, this method is being used more 
frequently for rabbits. It has also been adapted 
for other companion animals.
TTOUCH employs a gentle, nonforceful way 
of helping your rabbit deal with whatever is 
troubling him. Using circular movements of the 
fingers and hands over the rabbit’s body, as 
well as other related methods, TTOUCH practi-
tioners help rabbits discover new ways to deal 
with problems. Issues, such as excessive fear 
and aggression, are addressed through this 
method.
To find out more about this type of training or to 
find a TTOUCH rabbit practitioner in your area 
who can help you, visit the TTOUCH Web site at 
www.lindatellington-jones.com/

203
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
 
✓ Provide your rabbit with a variety of different objects to chew: toilet 
paper rolls, cardboard boxes, phone books, wicker baskets, blocks of 
nontreated wood, and so on.
 
✓ Say “no” or clap your hands when you see your bunny chewing on some-
thing she shouldn’t.
Digging In
Pet rabbits love to dig, which goes back to their days as wild bunnies when 
they had to excavate their own homes. By digging their little hearts out, wild 
bunnies create their very own dens located safely underground.
 
Although your rabbit doesn’t need to dig tunnels and warrens in which to 
retreat underground, her body doesn’t know that. Unfortunately, when domes-
tic bunnies get that urge to dig, it causes problems. Their owners get angry 
because the digging ruins the carpet, destroys the garden, and shreds the 
sofa. If your bunny is a merciless digger, causing damage and destroying your 
house and yard, you can take steps to rabbit-proof her surroundings, which is 
an essential part of the solution (see Chapter 5).
Rabbit-proofing will help but not prevent digging, however. Your next tactic 
is not to stop the digging but to provide your rabbit with acceptable digging 
alternatives:
 
✓ If a rabbit is determined to dig in a particular area, no matter what you 
do, cover a piece of board with carpet and put it in that favorite spot to 
protect the real carpet.
 
✓ Provide mats made from natural fibers, such as grass mats, which may 
satisfy the urge to dig and take your bunny’s focus off the carpet.
 
✓ Sacrifice or buy a pillow or cushion for your digger.
 
✓ Fill wicker baskets or cardboard boxes with newspaper or shredded 
paper; cut holes in the boxes to create tunnels and make things more 
interesting.
 
✓ Make tunnels out of old carpet rolls or cardboard concrete forms; 
try stuffing newspapers in one end to give your bunny a mission: dig 
through that paper!
 
✓ Try a cat scratching post, ramp, or mat.
 
✓ If outside (in safe conditions, of course), let your rabbit dig in a protected 
designated section of garden or yard; a big pile of hay or a box of sand 
also work.

Duking It Out
Rabbits have a reputation for being gentle and peace-loving creatures; so 
many new rabbit owners are shocked to find out that bunnies can be real 
hooligans when it comes to interacting with other rabbits.
 
Don’t let your rabbits fight because it can result in serious injury. In situations 
where rabbits are closely confined and don’t get along, they can even fight to 
the death.
 
Fighting is usually a problem in households where more than one rabbit 
resides. In single-bunny households, fighting is sometimes a problem between 
rabbits and other pets, although in most cases, the other pet backs down 
quickly and that’s the end of it. If you have more than one rabbit and are 
encountering a number of bunny battle royales, you need to take a close look 
at the situation to figure out what’s going on:
 
✓ Sex: If your rabbits aren’t spayed or neutered and they’re fighting, then 
the fact that they’re not spayed or neutered may be the problem. Intact 
males, in particular, like to fight and may even try to castrate each other. 
Either have your rabbits altered or separate them. Two males that 
haven’t been neutered will fight with each other. In many cases, females 
that haven’t been spayed will also fight with each other.
 
✓ Dominance: Two dominant rabbits who refuse to back down to one 
another won’t be able to live together peaceably. Keep these kinds of 
bunnies in separate cages and limit their exercise time together. Avoid 
feeding them while they’re together because the presence of food can 
often trigger a fight.
 
✓ Personality conflicts: Rabbits who normally get along well sometimes 
get into fights with each other. Pay close attention to the circumstances 
that lead up to a fight and try to eliminate the situation in the future. A 
favorite toy, a certain treat, or attention from a special person can start 
a fight between bunny friends. If necessary:
 
• Separate the rabbits when offering special things so that they 
won’t fight over them.
 
• Make sure that you have sufficient hide areas and litter boxes 
available when the rabbits are together. Have at least as many hide 
areas and litter boxes as you have rabbits. If space permits, one 
more space than the number of rabbits is preferred.
 
• Establish extra feeding areas on opposite sides to avoid 
“discussion” at feeding time.
 
• If all else fails, house the two opponents separately and give them 
individual free time. Although this approach will add to your work-
load, it may be best for the bunnies’ well-being.

205
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
Pee Marks the Spot
Dogs and cats aren’t the only critters who can urinate around the house and 
make a huge mess. Rabbits can be guilty of this atrocity, too. Just like dogs 
and cats, rabbits use their urine to mark their territory. When a rabbit uri-
nates on something, such as your carpet or possibly even you, he’s making a 
statement. In the case of an inanimate object, the statement is “This is part of 
my territory.” If your rabbit is spraying you, he’s claiming you as his mate!
 
You can take one significant step to eliminate the problem of inappropriate 
urinating: Spay or neuter your pet. The rabbits who are most guilty of this 
behavior are intact males, who are committing this act as a result of raging 
hormones. Females who haven’t been spayed are also prone to the behavior 
of urine-marking for the same reason.
If you don’t want to neuter or spay your rabbit because you plan to breed 
him, then you have to live with the urine-marking problem or keep your 
bunny from running loose in the house. Chapter 5 has information on how to 
clean up messes.
 
Other factors that contribute to inappropriate urination include
 
✓ Not enough litter boxes: You may not have enough litter boxes for the 
number of rabbits you have, or you may not have enough litter boxes 
for the space the rabbit is exercising in. If your rabbit has the run of the 
house, one box is not enough.
 
✓ Medical problems: If your rabbit was housetrained and is suddenly uri-
nating outside his litter box (especially if he’s going in multiple places 
with small amounts of urine), call the vet.
 
✓ Behavioral factors: For example, rabbits object to changes in the 
household and their caregiver’s schedule, as well as the introduction of 
new animals or people. Rabbits urinate inappropriately in response to 
situations that are stressful to them for whatever reason. You need to 
address these problems.
Protecting their space and place
This penchant to brawl goes back to the rab-
bit’s strong sense of territory and social hier-
archy. In wild rabbit colonies, each bunny has 
to get along with the crowd yet also maintain 
his own space, territory, and place in the group. 
Because rabbits aren’t big on conversation, 
they claim their space and place through body 
language. Fighting is body language taken to 
the extreme. (For more on rabbit body language, 
see Chapter 11.)

206
Par t III: Rabbit Psychology: Behavior and Training 
Realize that rabbits, particularly intact males, urinate (spray) on vertical 
surfaces. Females can spray but usually do so to a lesser degree. Even if neu-
tered, male rabbits tend to direct the urine outward instead of downward, 
urinating along a border, wall, or corner. In order to prevent inadvertent acci-
dents in the litter box, make sure that the litter box is deep enough to have 
a side to confine the urine and put newspaper or plastic carpet protector 
under litter boxes that are outside the cage to catch any urine that goes over 
the edge for easy cleanup.
Barbering
 
Do you have a rabbit who is pulling big chunks of fur from his coat? Barbering 
refers to hair pulling or hair chewing (not pulled out but chewed off). Rabbits 
can do barber themselves or each other. If you see barbering, it’s not because 
your rabbit is pulling his hair out in frustration or trying to make a rabbit fur 
jacket for your next birthday.
 
Actually, one of several things is going on:
 
✓ Your female is pregnant, preparing to give birth, or suffering from a false 
pregnancy. Pulling fur from her body to line the nest she’s preparing for 
her kits is normal, so if she’s pregnant or thinks she is, it’s not some-
thing you need to worry about.
 
✓ When two or more rabbits are pulling each other’s fur, it’s usually a sign 
of boredom or dominance behavior. The behavior may not stop until 
they’re separated or given a larger space and more things to do
 
✓ Someone is sick. If your female is spayed or you have a male rabbit who is 
pulling fur, take your rabbit to the vet. Parasites, such as fleas and mites, 
as well as irritating skin disorders, or internal pain can motivate a rabbit 
to pull out its fur. (Chapters 9 and 10 offer more health information.)
 
✓ Barbering can also be the result of a poor diet that is low in fiber.
Shaking in His Bunny Boots: Fearfulness
Being the owner of a nervous, fearful rabbit is frustrating. Although rabbits 
tend to be flighty in general because of their nature as prey animals, some 
rabbits never seem able to relax. No matter how comfortable you make their 
surroundings, they seem to hop around in constant fear.

207
 Chapter 13: Reckoning with a Bad Bunny
Like people, rabbits are individuals, and some individuals are more nervous 
than others. Factors can include
 
✓ Breed: For more information on which breeds tend to be nervous, read 
Chapter 3. Smaller rabbits tend to be more high-strung than larger 
breeds.
 
✓ Genetics: Some rabbits come from genetic lines that are more fearful 
than others within their own breed.
 
✓ Socialization: Poor socialization as a youngster can make for a dis-
tracted adult.
 
✓ Stress: A stressful environment can put a rabbit on edge.
If you have a rabbit with a nervous personality, think about which of these 
preceding factors may come into play. If it’s breed or genetics, you can’t do 
much about it except create a calm, relaxing atmosphere for your pet. If your 
pet’s environment is to blame for your rabbit’s nervousness, the situation 
needs some reworking.
 
The following checklist can determine whether you can make improvements 
to your rabbit’s environment:
 
✓ Good climate: Don’t expose your bunny to temperature extremes, espe-
cially heat.
 
✓ Privacy: Your rabbit must have a nest box where he can go when he 
feels the need to hide from the world.
 
✓ Proper diet: Give your pet access to unlimited amounts of grass hay and 
fresh green foods daily.
 
✓ Proper handling: Your pet needs to be handled in a way that helps him 
feel secure; lift him only when necessary.
 
✓ Protection from other pets: Don’t allow your dog or cat to bother or ter-
rorize your rabbit.
 
✓ Quiet surroundings: Don’t expose your bunny to repeated loud noises 
and activity.

Chapter 14
Playing Around Isn’t Just for Dogs
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the best toys
▶ Playing interactive games
▶ Watching rabbits have fun
W
hoever coined the phrase “Jump for joy” must’ve had rabbits in mind. 
Bunnies love to run, jump, and play probably as much or more than 
any other creature. Seeing a rabbit play is one of the most delightful scenes 
to watch.
Play is a natural behavior for rabbits, even in the wild. When a rabbit plays, 
he cavorts, running, leaping, and batting around inanimate objects. The 
amount of play any rabbit engages in depends on his personality (some are 
more playful than others) and the opportunities he has to play.
As a rabbit owner, you have a couple of options when it comes to appreciat-
ing your rabbit’s propensity for play (and helping him get the daily exercise 
he needs). You can choose to share in your rabbit’s playful moments by pro-
viding toys for your pet (some interactive), or you can sit back and delight in 
the rabbit’s goofiness.
Getting Playful with Toys
It comes as a surprise to many people that rabbits love to play with toys. People 
typically think of cats and dogs as being the only critters who like to bat a ball 
around or carry something in their mouths, but rabbits are right up there with 
animals who like to amuse themselves with a variety of inanimate objects.
 
Some common toys for rabbits include household items like empty toilet 
paper rolls, cardboard boxes, and plastic cups. Store-bought toys often 
enjoyed include items commonly sold for cats: small balls, catnip mice (rab-
bits don’t get turned on by catnip, but they like the shape of the toy), and 
string-equipped toys you can drag around.

212
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny
Of course, not every rabbit likes every toy. Rabbits are individuals, and while 
one toy may make one rabbit crazy, the same toy can bore another. Trial 
and error is key to discovering what your rabbit likes to play with. Donate 
the toys he doesn’t like to an animal shelter or swap them with your rabbit-
owning friends.
 
In the case of rabbits, toys are a great way to
 
✓ Help your rabbit focus his energies. House rabbits deprived of toys 
play with furniture, electrical cords, and other interesting items. 
(Although if you read Chapter 5, you can find out how to help prevent 
these catastrophes from occurring.) By providing your rabbit with 
suitable toys to play with, you help him to be a good, nondestructive 
member of the household. Toys, particularly wooden ones, help keep 
bunnies’ teeth in check.
 
✓ Encourage regular exercise and prevent boredom. By providing your 
rabbit with a toy and space to play, you give him the opportunity to remain 
physically active and mentally alert. Whether they’re for digging, chewing, 
climbing, hiding, running through tunnels, toys help initiate play and exer-
cise. And, of course, exercise means a healthier rabbit who is less likely to 
develop problems, such as obesity, weak bones and muscles, and diges-
tive maladies. (For more on these conditions, see Chapters 9 and 10).
 
✓ Bond with your bunny. While using toys to play with and even interact 
with your bunny, you enrich the relationship between you and your 
bunny and build trust in the heart of your rabbit. (Another great way to 
bond is through grooming, which is discussed in Chapter 7.)
Keeping safety first
Whether you give your rabbit toys that are homemade, commercially made, 
or a combination of the two, safety is important. The following list tells you 
what to look out for:
 
✓ Rabbits like to chew on just about everything. Be certain that all 
products that you give your rabbit are nontoxic.
 
✓ If you see your bunny chomping on a toy that’s not meant to be 
chewed — a towel, rubber ball, a shoe, or stuffed sock — take the toy 
away. Although most rabbits don’t swallow nonfood items, it’s best to 
watch carefully and remove anything the rabbit is appearing to ingest, 
including allegedly “rabbit-safe” toys.
 
✓ Keep an eye out for toys with small parts that can be pulled or fall off 
and be easily swallowed. Look out for string, plastic eyes, and other toy 
parts that can end up in your rabbit’s stomach, causing a blockage.

213
 Chapter 14: Playing Around Isn’t Just for Dogs
 
✓ Just because a product claims to be made for rabbits doesn’t make it 
a good choice. Consider, for example, an edible tiki hut made of straw 
and hay combined with some grains and molasses (two ingredients not 
in a rabbit-friendly diet). Instead, choose a 100 percent hay hut for your 
bunny’s enjoyment.
Going prefab
If you like shopping for your rabbit, then you’ll enjoy going to the pet-supply 
store and buying toys for your pet. Keep in mind, however, that the most 
expensive toy you buy may also be the toy that is consistently ignored by 
your rabbit who is instead fascinated by the cardboard oatmeal canister.
 
 See the following list of commercially made toys that rabbits often like:
 
✓ Assorted toys and bells made for parrots
 
✓ Hard plastic toys made for human babies
 
✓ Sisal (a type of rope) toys made for rabbits
 
✓ Small cat or dog houses made of cloth that look like tents
 
✓ Small plastic or wire balls with bells inside made for cats
 
✓ Straw or bamboo balls made for hamsters
 
✓ Stuffed socks made for cats
 
✓ Unfinished (no stain or lacquer applied) wicker, straw, or woven grass 
baskets of all sizes
 
✓ Unfinished wicker tunnels for rabbits
 
✓ Wooden chew toys made for rabbits or rodents
You can also search the Internet for rabbit toy manufacturers. See the 
Appendix for a list of online rabbit-supply retailers.
Made from scratch
If your budget is tight, go the homemade route with your rabbit. Or if you’re 
like most rabbit owners, you may want to combine homemade rabbit toys 
with store-bought items. (Keep in mind that rabbits can sometimes be 
destructive with their toys. Don’t share anything with bunny that you don’t 
want teeth marks in!)

214
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny
 
Check out this listing of homemade toys that rabbits enjoy:
 
✓ Box of shredded white paper to encourage jumping and digging
 
✓ Cardboard box of any size (Make sure that all staples, tape, and other 
noncardboard items are off the box before the rabbit gets a hold of it.)
 
✓ Cardboard toilet paper and paper towel rolls
 
✓ Dried pine cones (Make sure that they’re untreated. Some pine cones are 
sold painted or varnished.)
 
✓ Large PVC pipes for tunnels or large cardboard tubes
 
✓ Newspapers
 
✓ Oatmeal boxes with the ends cut off
 
✓ Old phone books (take off shiny covers)
 
✓ Paper cups (without coating and no Styrofoam)
 
✓ Paper grocery bags for shredding
 
✓ Metal lids from jars for flipping
 
✓ Soda can with a pebble inside (Be careful about any sharp edges.)
 
✓ Straw baskets (untreated and filled with straw for digging)
 
✓ Straw whisk broom
 
✓ Towels (for bunching and pulling, but be sure they’re not being ingested)
 
✓ Tree branches for your rabbit to gnaw on and drag around (must be pes-
ticide free and dried — apple and pear are appreciated (see the list of 
safe plants in Chapter 8).
Tag! You’re It! Playing Games
You can get interactive with your pet and make it a game for two. Rabbits 
have been known to initiate games of tag with humans, bat a ball, and chase 
toys dragged around in a circle. Start simple by getting down on the floor, 
offering your bunny kisses, and tossing a toy gently in her direction.
 
If you want to play interactive games with your rabbit, keep in mind that the 
game is best left up to the rabbit. Because of the rabbit’s wary nature, chasing 
your pet isn’t a good idea. A game of chase usually frightens a rabbit, who may 
suddenly feel like he’s being preyed upon. However, if your rabbit starts to 
chase you, he wants you to leave the area, or he’s prodding you for a game of 
tag. If your rabbit is in a playful mood and starts to chase after you, he’s initi-
ating a game of tag.

If he’s fearful, 
he may become 
aggressive or 
spend more time 
hiding.
Hanging clothes
Hang some strips of 
newspaper or paper 
towel from a clothes-
line within your 
rabbit’s reach.
Your pet may find it 
amusing to grab these 
items with his teeth 
or paws and tug on 
them.
Hide and seek
Hide in a spot 
where your rabbit 
can easily find you. 
With a favorite treat 
in hand, call your 
bunny. When he dis-
covers you, give him 
the treat. Then hide 
again with another 
treat.
It won’t take long 
before you won’t have 
to use the treat. Some 
rabbit owners have 
even discovered their 
bunnies will take turns 
hiding with them.
Obstacle course
Use boxes, tubes, 
and other items to 
create a rabbit-size 
obstacle course.
Use your bunny’s 
favorite treat to lure 
her around, over, and 
through the course.
Tag
You don’t initiate 
this game: He 
does, by chasing 
you.
Let him catch you 
and then sprint off 
again. 
Avoid chasing 
and tagging 
the rabbit 
because this 
type of play 
frightens 
bunnies.

trusting.
Amusing Themselves
One of the greatest joys of rabbit ownership is watching your bunny play in 
a rabbit-proofed room or backyard. (See Chapters 5 and 8, respectively, for 
details on rabbit-proofing and outdoor exercise.) Rabbits can be incredibly 
silly and goofy, and their antics can leave you rolling on the floor laughing.
Having a hoppy good time
If you have a rabbit who seems especially keen 
on hopping and maneuvering through obstacle 
courses, consider going pro. The sport of rabbit 
hopping is taking off in the United States (see 
Chapter 15).
Imagine you and your rabbit (with or without 
matching tracksuits) negotiating your way 
through the jumps and obstacles of a hopping 
course on your way to victory. Sound appealing?

 Chapter 14: Playing Around Isn’t Just for Dogs
Much like their wild ancestors, pet rabbits also like to play — with humans 
and with other animals. Rabbits have been known to play with dogs and cats, 
as well as with other rabbits. Solitary play is also a popular pastime of rab-
bits, who love to find ways to amuse themselves.
Making like The Pointer Sisters: Jumping
Nature gave the rabbit strong hindquarters and leg muscles to escape from 
predators, but rabbits also use these assets for jumping in play. Playful rab-
bits can be seen leaping up in the air, springing forward, or even straight up 
for the sheer joy of it.
 
In the wild, jumping helps a rabbit change direction quickly when running 
from a predator. When a rabbit leaps, her body twists in the air and typically 
lands facing a different direction, usually a 180-degree turn.
When two rabbits play together, they often run together, one chasing the 
other. The bunny being pursued sometimes leaps into the air, twists around, 
lands, and takes off again. The goal of the pursuing rabbit is to switch direc-
tions just as fast as the bunny she’s chasing.
Tiny chariots of fire
Another defense mechanism that rabbits use for amusement when they feel 
safe and relaxed in their environment is running at top speed. This ability 
comes in handy for avoiding predators, but a speedy run is also a terrific way 
to have a good time, especially with other rabbits.
If you have a single rabbit, your bunny may simply run through the house or 
yard just for the fun of it. If you have more than one rabbit, running and chas-
ing will be a favorite pastime among the two. (See Chapter 2 for the scoop on 
whether adopting two rabbits is a good idea.)
Watching your rabbit run playfully at full speed is loads of fun. The speed at 
which bunnies run is amazing. If you blink, you can literally miss your pet 
going by.

Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny
Various and sundry other hijinks
When it comes to funny antics, rabbits have a slew of tricks up their prover-
bial sleeves, such as the following ones:
 
✓ Binki: A rabbit may hop quietly along and then suddenly leap straight 
up for no apparent reason and then land again. Then the bunny contin-
ues to mosey along as if nothing happened.
 
✓ Digging: Another favorite and funny pastime of rabbits is digging. Give a 
bunny a good box or corner of sand, fine gravel, or soft dirt, and watch it 
fly. You can buy bags of sandbox sand at home-improvement stores and 
nurseries (the plant kind of nursery, not the baby kind). (Giving your rabbit 
a box to dig in is also a good way to keep him from doing it to the carpet.)
 
✓ Tunneling: Rabbits love tunnels, and it’s great fun to see your bunny go 
in one end of a box or tube and come out the other, over and over again. 
Some owners buy play tunnels meant for cats and hook them together 
with built-in snaps to create elaborate tunnel systems for a playful bunny.
A rabbit and her friends
In the wild, rabbits are playful creatures who love 
to engage their fellow rabbits in games. In his 
book The Private Life of the Rabbit (Buccaneer 
Books), R.M. Lockley writes about wild rab-
bits chasing each other, running in circles, 
jumping into the air, and rolling in the grass. In 
the situations Lockley observed, the only reason 
for this behavior appeared to be that the rabbits 
felt good and wanted to show it.

Getting Hoppy with 
Your House Rabbit
In This Chapter
▶ Flocking together with other rabbit lovers
▶ Signing up to save bunnies
▶ Leaping into rabbit hopping
▶ Competing against other rabbits
M
ost people get enough joy from their rabbits by just having them as 
companions. If you’re more laid-back or have little time to spare, you 
can have plenty of fun playing at home with your rabbit (see Chapter 14). But 
if you’re the type of person who likes to really get involved with your pets 
and has the time and money, you may want to consider participating in any 
of one several activities available for rabbit owners.
Whether showing your rabbit, hopping alongside your pet, participating in a 
rabbit club, or rescuing homeless rabbits, you get much more from your rela-
tionship with your rabbit if you take advantage of some of what’s out there 
for rabbits.
Clubbing It
If you love rabbits, you want to be around other people who love rabbits, too. 
Being with other rabbit lovers is where rabbit clubs come in. You can find all 
kinds of rabbit clubs and groups, designed for various tastes:
Regional rabbit clubs
People are much like rabbits. They like to be with their own kind. That’s why 
regional rabbit clubs are growing in popularity. Geared toward rabbit owners 

220
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
who live within a specific geographical area, regional rabbit clubs are locally 
based. Not every city and town in the country has a regional rabbit club, of 
course, but plenty of them do. If you live in a place that doesn’t have one, 
consider starting one.
 
In the United States, most rabbit clubs are geared toward adults who are 
showing purebred rabbits, but some groups do include pet owner and youth 
programs. By joining a regional rabbit club, you can attend meetings and local 
shows, and you’ll find out much more about caring for your rabbit. If you’re 
interested in showing and breeding, you can gain invaluable knowledge on 
these subjects from fellow members.
To locate the regional rabbit club in your area, contact the American Rabbit 
Breeders Association, Inc. (ARBA). You can find links to ARBA chartered 
clubs on the group’s Web site at www.arba.net or by asking your local 
rabbit veterinarian whether a regional club exists in your area. (If you’re out-
side the United States, see the Appendix for contact information on interna-
tional rabbit associations.)
Signing up with the House Rabbit Society
If you want to devote your rabbit-oriented energies to helping bunnies in 
need, as well as helping to educate others about rabbit care, you may want 
to consider joining a local House Rabbit Society chapter. The House Rabbit 
Society is a national organization that works to improve the quality of life for 
rabbits everywhere. The members of local chapters host regular meetings, 
volunteer at shelters, house abandoned rabbits in foster homes, and set up 
booths at community events to promote responsible rabbit ownership.
For more information about the House Rabbit Society and similar groups, see 
Chapter 4 and the “Rescuing Rabbits” section, later in this chapter.
Kid-friendly groups
So your daughter begged you for a rabbit, and now you’re the one cleaning 
his litter box. Or maybe you bought the rabbit that your son wanted, and he 
just can’t get enough of his pet. Either way, getting your child more involved 
is a good idea. Your best bets are
 
✓ 4-H: By getting involved in a 4-H rabbit project, your child can find out 
about rabbit care and handling. She can also show her rabbit, even if the 
bunny isn’t a purebred.
 
 Parents have plenty of opportunities to get involved with their child’s 
4-H rabbit project, too. Clubs are always looking for leaders, chaperones, 

221
 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
and other volunteers. You should also help your child with the rabbit’s 
daily maintenance. Find out more about 4-H in the “Taking the 4-H route” 
section, later in this chapter.
 
✓ House Rabbit Society: See ’“Rescuing Rabbits,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Local kid-focused groups: 4-H programs are probably most prevalent, 
but be on the lookout for other clubs for rabbit- and pet-lovers alike.
Rescuing Rabbits
If you want to go beyond being a responsible rabbit owner, you can get more 
involved by joining a local rabbit rescue club, a group devoted to the rescue 
and rehoming of unwanted rabbits. The problem of homeless rabbits is a 
serious one, and people who love rabbits are needed to volunteer at rescue 
organizations around the country. Chapter 4 offers more specific shelter and 
rescue group information, including why this problem exists and how each 
works from the adoption perspective.
 
Perhaps the most prominent rescue group is the House Rabbit Society, which 
has local chapters around the United States, each involved in rabbit rescue 
and welfare. By getting involved with a House Rabbit Society chapter or 
another rabbit rescue organization, you can do wonders to help rabbits in 
need. (You can find a list of House Rabbit Society local chapters and other 
rescue organizations in the Appendix.)
Among the type of volunteer opportunities available for rabbit lovers:
 
✓ Passing out fliers in front of pet stores about rabbits needing homes.
 
✓ Providing rabbit food to a rabbit foster home in your area.
 
✓ Providing a foster home for a rabbit. (See the “Halfway there: Fostering” 
section, later in this chapter, for more on this topic.)
 
✓ Start a local chapter of the House Rabbit Society if one doesn’t exist 
already.
Being proactive
 
Your heart aches for homeless bunnies, but what can you do about it? Plenty.
 
✓ Consider adopting one from a shelter or a rabbit rescue group. That is, 
when the time comes to acquire a rabbit, take in a homeless rabbit.
 
✓ Be a responsible rabbit owner. Being responsible means spaying or 
neutering your pet rabbit and refraining from breeding your pet if you 
don’t plan to get involved with showing.

222
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
✓ Educate fellow rabbit owners about the plight of homeless rabbits. 
Encourage them to spay and neuter their pets and advise them not to 
breed their pets or turn them loose for a life of so-called freedom.
  
 Give them information on local rabbit organizations and the proper care 
of rabbits (available from the House Rabbit Society.) Be honest about 
the pros and cons of owning a rabbit when asked and have people read 
in advance about rabbits for pets . . . books like this one!.
 
✓ Be an advocate for responsible rabbit ownership. If you come across a 
friend or relative who is thinking about getting a rabbit, encourage them 
to consider their decision carefully. Owning a rabbit is a big commitment 
and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Maybe you could loan this book to him.
 
✓ When you meet someone who has just acquired a rabbit, offer to 
help with the new pet. Provide the new pet owner with literature on 
how to properly feed and care for a rabbit and explain the importance 
of responsible ownership. Remind new rabbit owners that if they want 
to get rid of their pet, they should take it to a shelter or rabbit rescue 
group — not turn it loose to fend for itself.
Halfway there: Fostering
If you have a big heart and want to help homeless rabbits, consider providing a 
foster home for a bunny in need. Foster homes for rabbits are halfway houses 
of sorts, providing homeless bunnies with a temporary place to live and 
adjust to normal life while a permanent home is sought.
As a foster parent to a rabbit, you keep the bunny until a home is found. 
You’ll probably be asked to evaluate the rabbit’s temperament and behavior, 
so people seeking to adopt a rabbit have a sense of what the bunny is like.
Instead of shelters, foster homes are used by a variety of rabbit rescue 
groups throughout the country. In the case of the House Rabbit Society, the 
organization has local chapters and a network of foster homes within each 
chapter. (You can find a list of HRS chapters in the Appendix.)
A call to your local chapter can start you on the road to becoming a foster 
parent. Providing a foster home for a rabbit is rewarding and really makes a 
difference for the animal. Of course, when you foster a rabbit, you may fall in 
love with the bunny and want to keep it. Many foster parents do.
Rabbit Hopping
Some people think that showing rabbits is fun, but they haven’t seen fun 
until they’ve gone rabbit hopping. What the heck is rabbit hopping? Similar to 

223
 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
horse show jumping and dog agility, rabbit hopping is a competitive activity 
that involves both rabbit owners and their rabbits negotiating various obsta-
cles on a course. (Rabbits wear harnesses and leashes.)
In the United States, the sport of rabbit hopping is managed by the Rabbit 
Hopping Organization of America, or RHOA. (See the Appendix for contact 
information.) According to rabbit owners who participate in this sport, the 
rabbits enjoy it as much as the owners. The obstacles are varied, but most 
of them are jumps. The following jumps are typically seen in the rabbit 
hopping arena:
 
✓ Broad: Two horizontal poles with a set of boards placed on the ground 
between them.
 
✓ Pole: Two horizontal poles with one or more raised vertical poles 
between them.
 
✓ Water: An obstacle consisting of a small body of water, usually with 
bushes on either side
 
For the safety of your rabbit, don’t try these obstacles at home! Both you and 
your rabbit need training to participate safely in rabbit hopping. Get involved 
in the RHOA to safely learn this sport.
 
Horse show jumping was the inspiration for rabbit hopping, and many of the 
first rules and ideas for rabbit hopping came from horse show jumping. Rabbit 
hopping started in Sweden in the 1970s and quickly spread to other parts 
of Europe. The sport is popular in Norway and Denmark and is growing in 
Germany and the United States.
Getting up to speed (and height)
 
Just as the hopping course has hurdles, so does the preparation process:
 
1. Become a member of your national rabbit hopping organization.
 
 In the United States, contact the RHOA. Outside the US? See the 
Appendix for rabbit-hopping organizations in your country. Not all coun-
tries have one of these groups.
 
2. Train your rabbit.
 
 Training for rabbit hopping involves careful work with the rabbit’s safety 
and emotional well-being in mind — training must be positive and gentle. 
Basic training, including walking with a leash, is described in Chapter 12; 
you’ll work up to using a structured groundwork technique, which 
shows you how to train your rabbit to negotiate a hopping course.

224
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
 Conditioning, another important aspect of training, requires you to 
slowly build your rabbit up to the point where he has the physical agility 
and endurance to negotiate a rabbit-hopping course.
 
 For help on training your rabbit for rabbit hopping, contact the local 
chapter of your national rabbit hopping association. If you live in the 
United States, contact the RHOA.
 
3. Become familiar with the rules.
 
 Designed for the safety of the rabbit in large part, the rules for rabbit 
hopping are more complicated than you may think, involving close to 
150 guidelines. A couple of basics:
 
• Any rabbit over the age of 4 months can participate.
 
• Rabbits must wear a harness and leash during the hopping 
competition.
 
• Handlers must give rabbits enough room to move around the 
jumps if they’re so inclined and jump freely through the course.
 
4. Memorize the course in advance.
 
 Walking through the course several times will help you remember the 
order of the obstacles when it’s time to do your run. The obstacles tend 
to be laid out in a logical order — the obstacle you first see upon com-
pleting a step is usually the one you’re supposed to take next.
Taking the plunge
If rabbit hopping sounds like fun to you and you’d like to try it, contact your 
national rabbit-hopping association. (See the Appendix for contact informa-
tion.) Because the sport is just getting started in the United States, not too 
many clubs have been created throughout the country. However, you can 
start your own rabbit-hopping club.
 
Membership in a rabbit-hopping organization usually includes a packet with 
rules and guidelines, detailed information on choosing the right rabbit for 
hopping, training information, directions to and descriptions of the hopping 
courses available, diagrams on how to build jumps, and judge’s score sheets 
for hopping events.
Putting on the sweatsuit: Training
Before you can participate in a rabbit-hopping event, you need to train your 
rabbit. Training involves careful work with the rabbit’s safety and emotional 
well-being in mind. Remember that rabbits are timid creatures, and training 

225
 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
must be positive and gentle! A structured ground work technique is used in 
training rabbits for this sport. Conditioning is another important aspect of 
training and requires that you slowly build your rabbit up to the point where 
he can negotiate a rabbit-hopping course.
For help on training your rabbit for rabbit hopping, contact the Rabbit 
Hopping Association of America. For the price of membership, the organiza-
tion provides detailed information on how to train a rabbit for competition, 
along with other kinds of information on the sport of rabbit hopping.
Showing Rabbits
Probably one of the oldest of all rabbit activities is the sport of showing. 
Although no bunny show parallels the Westminster Dog Show broadcast on 
TV every year, you can still take your rabbit in front of an American Rabbit 
Breeders Association judge for evaluation.
ARBA rabbit shows are basically bunny beauty contests. Rabbits are judged 
in categories according to their breed and are compared to their breed stan-
dard, a blueprint of the ideal rabbit of that breed, which describes what the 
rabbit’s body should look like in great detail. Judges give points to each of 
the rabbit’s body areas described in the standard.
To participate in the conformation part of ARBA rabbit shows (the part of 
showing where your rabbit is judged on his appearance as opposed to you 
being judged on your handling skills), you need a special show rabbit, one 
that you have purchased specifically for this reason.
Picking up the rabbit and looking over his physical qualities, judges examine the 
rabbit. A rabbit is not judged on the basis of his behavior — only his appearance. 
The rabbit exhibited in a given show within his breed class who most repre-
sents the breed standard that day is the rabbit who wins the blue ribbon.
Owners who show their rabbits are responsible for grooming the bunny 
before the show, transporting him to the event, and getting him to the judg-
ing arena in time for the rabbit’s class.
 
You can show only unneutered and unspayed purebred rabbits in the beauty 
contest aspect of rabbit shows. (See Chapter 9 for information on problems 
relating to rabbits who aren’t spayed or neutered.) Showmanship classes for 
youngsters that evaluate the child’s presentation of a rabbit (the way the child 
presents the rabbit to the judge for evaluation) don’t require an unspayed or 
unneutered purebred bunny.

226
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
Considering pros and cons
Before you embark on a show career with your rabbit, consider the pros and 
cons of participating in this activity with your pet.
Pros:
 
✓ Showing your rabbit can be plenty of fun. You’ll not only enjoy the 
excitement of the game, but you’ll meet other rabbit owners and find 
yourself becoming part of a whole new world of rabbit lovers.
 
✓ You’ll find out more about rabbits by showing them.
Cons:
 
✓ Showing puts plenty of pressure, both physical and emotional, on your 
rabbit because of extensive handling and transporting. He’s also more 
likely to come in contact with a contagious disease from another rabbit 
at a show.
 
✓ For a rabbit to be shown at some events, he must be tattooed. (See this 
chapter’s “Getting some ink: Tattooing.”) Some rabbit owners don’t like 
tattooing because a tattoo leaves a permanent mark on the rabbit’s ear, 
and the tattooing process causes temporary pain to the rabbit.
Attending your first show
What can you expect when you attend your first rabbit show? The experience 
can be a bit daunting if you don’t know what’s going on. However, if you have 
a sense of the process, you’ll be less confused and intimidated, and you may 
actually have fun your first time around.
Preparing
Before you even set foot at the show venue, prepare yourself and your rabbit 
in the following way:
 
✓ Go to a show. Before you enter your first show, attend a rabbit show as a 
spectator. Attending gives you a good idea of what to expect, and know-
ing what to expect can make the difference between a nervous rookie and 
a confident pro. Arrive at the show in the morning and spend the entire 
day walking around and watching how things work. Don’t forget to ask 
questions if you don’t understand what you’re seeing. Rabbit people are a 
friendly lot, and most are happy to answer questions.
 
✓ Study the breed standard. Before you even select your first show 
rabbit, familiarize yourself with your rabbit’s breed standard. Write to 
ARBA or visit the organization’s Web site to order a copy of Standard of 

227
 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
Perfection — a booklet that contains descriptions of all ARBA-recognized 
breeds of rabbits. Judges use these breed standards to evaluate rabbits 
that come before them at shows. After you study the standard, take a 
good look at your rabbit to get a sense of how much your bunny exem-
plifies the breed’s standard. You can even ask another expert in your 
rabbit’s breed for an opinion.
 
✓ Have your rabbit tattooed. Before you show your rabbit, you must have 
someone place a permanent tattoo in his left ear that will be registered 
with ARBA. (See the “Getting some ink: Tattooing” section, later in this 
chapter.)
 
✓ Groom your rabbit. The quality of your rabbit’s coat has a strong 
impact on the judge’s decision at a rabbit show. The judge wants to see 
a coat that’s proper for the breed (according to the breed standard) and 
that looks healthy and well cared for. (Chapter 7 has details on groom-
ing your rabbit, and Chapter 3 can tell you more about rabbit coats.)
 
✓ Condition your rabbit. Rabbit show judges not only look for rabbits 
with good fur but also in good “flesh.” The term flesh refers to the rab-
bit’s overall body condition. Rabbits who are underfed or poorly fed 
won’t be in good flesh, and a judge is likely to mark down your show 
rabbit. (See Chapter 6 for details on how to properly feed your rabbit.)
 
✓ Psyche up your rabbit. No, you don’t need to teach your rabbit to medi-
tate before he goes into the competition ring, but you do need to get him 
ready for the way that the judge will handle him. Practice handling him 
the way the judge will.
 
 Judges usually pose a rabbit in his proper position, the designated 
proper position each breed must be shown in. The judge then turns the 
rabbit over on his back to check the teeth, toenails, and straightness of 
legs, eye color, and tail. The rabbit is returned to his proper pose and 
checked for body conformation (the way your rabbit is put together) and 
condition of the flesh and fur.
 
 Keep in mind that not all rabbit breeds are posed the same way, so 
determine the proper posing for the breed that you’re showing by study-
ing the breed standard and watching the judging of your breed while at 
a show. Spend about 10 to 15 minutes a day practicing posing with your 
rabbit and remember to be patient with your pet.
Making your checklist
Glance at this checklist the night before the show and make sure that every-
thing is packed before you head out:
 
✓ Entry forms and judge’s card: Pack your filled-out entry cards (which 
you picked up at another show) and judge’s comments cards, assuming 
that you’ve done this ahead of time. (If you didn’t, don’t worry. You can 
get the forms and fill them out when you get to the show.) Figure 15-1 
shows a judge’s card.

228
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
✓ Pedigree: If you plan to register your rabbit at the show, bring your 
rabbit’s three-generation pedigree (your rabbit’s genealogy) with you.
 
✓ Rabbit eats: Your bunny needs food and familiar water during the time 
he’s at the show. Bring chopped-up vegetables, hay, and timothy pellets, if 
he eats them. Use a cooler to keep the produce fresh and bring a bottle 
of water from home.
 
✓ Grooming tools: Don’t forget to bring a brush for last-minute fur 
brushing. (For more about these tools, see Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Disinfectant: Bring a hand disinfectant to clean your hands after handling 
rabbits other than you own. You can also buy disinfectant wipes to wipe 
off a table or other items touched by another rabbit. These products are 
alcohol based and should contain 60 to 70 percent alcohol to be effective. 
You may also want to bring a spray disinfectant and paper towels to 
clean up any accidents your pet may have outside of his cage.

 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
 
✓ Clothing and shoes: Consider bringing a smock or another shirt that 
you can put on over your regular clothes if you’re going to handle rab-
bits other than your own. Remove that shirt before going back and 
handling your rabbit to minimize the spread of disease. If rabbits are 
allowed to run around the floor at the show, consider wearing washable 
shoes that you can remove before you return home.
 
✓ Your other stuff: Bring directions to the show, a chair to sit on, some-
thing to drink, your lunch, and whatever else you may need. (If you had 
to travel far to get to the show, bring your overnight bag. See Chapter 16 
for information on how to pack your rabbit’s suitcase, too.) Remember, 
most of your day is spent waiting for your rabbit to be judged, so you 
want to be comfortable.
 
✓ Your good sportsmanship: Win or lose, remember to always be a good 
sport. Be polite to the judge and to the other exhibitors. And have fun!
The big day
On the day of the show, you have a number of responsibilities. Following 
these guidelines can help you feel more confident and may even improve 
your chances of winning:
 
1. Travel well.
 
 You need to get your rabbit to the show, and you’ll probably do so by 
way of automobile. Believe it or not, the way that you transport your 
rabbit that day can make a big difference in how well you do at the show 
because rabbits are easily stressed.
 
 You can help reduce the chance of a stressed-out rabbit by
 
 Keeping your rabbit in a secure, comfortable carrier that contains 
your rabbit’s favorite bedding.
 
 Making sure that water and food are available to your rabbit at all 
times during the trip.
 
 Padding under the carrier to reduce the bumpiness of the ride for 
your rabbit. (Chapter 16 has in-depth traveling information.)
 
 Showgrounds and parking areas are usually well marked with large signs 
that say “This way to rabbit show!” Be prepared to pay for parking, 
although it depends on the venue.
 
2. Check in with the show secretary.
 
 There you also
 
• Pay for your entries (for each class your rabbit enters, usually a 
fairly small fee per class).

230
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
• Fill out entry cards (your rabbit’s name and breed, your name and 
address, and so on) and show remarks cards (the card that the 
judge writes her comments on after judging your rabbit) if you 
haven’t already done this at home.
 
3. Register.
 
 If you haven’t already registered your rabbit with ARBA and you want 
to do so, you can do it if you have time before your first class. Take the 
rabbit to the registrar seated at an ARBA table at the show. Show your 
three-generation pedigree to the registrar. (See the “The ARBA Way” 
section, later in this chapter, for more on how such shows are organized 
and what’s required.)
 
4. Find the judging.
 
 Locate the table where your breed is being judged and pick a place close 
by to set up your rabbit’s carrying cage and your chair. Be sure to find 
a shady spot if the show is being held outdoors because direct sun and 
heat can hurt your rabbit.
 
5. Pay attention.
 
 You’ll soon find yourself visiting with other rabbit owners and getting 
distracted looking at all the cute bunnies. Pay attention to when your 
class is called so that you don’t miss your turn at the judging table.
Taking the 4-H route
If your kids are interested in rabbit activities, you may want to join a 4-H club 
in your area. 4-H is an organization created to help children learn about how 
to care for and exhibit livestock.
 
To obtain information on a local 4-H rabbit project, contact your local Cooperative 
Extension Office listed in your local telephone book under County Government. 
For general information about 4-H, contact the National 4-H Council listed in 
the Appendix.
4-H is open to children from age 9 through 19, and sometimes younger, depend-
ing on the individual club. Typical 4-H rabbit projects feature hands-on work 
with rabbits. Children are taught how to feed, care for, handle, groom, and 
show their rabbits, and they often bring their rabbits to meetings.
Volunteers, usually parents whose children have been involved with the 
program for some time, run 4-H clubs. Individual 4-H projects, such as 
rabbits, have leaders as well. These people are usually parents and are 
often breeders or former breeders who have spent a substantial amount of 
time showing rabbits.

231
 Chapter 15: Get ting Hoppy with Your House Rabbit
 
Shows specifically for 4-H rabbit owners are held around the country and 
follow the rules and breed standards established by ARBA. Typically, 4-H 
members exhibit their rabbits at county fairs because 4-H often has a strong 
presence at these events.
4-H fairs usually occur in the summer, when heat stroke is common in 
warmer parts of the country. To keep rabbits cool, some owners will provide 
frozen water bottles (a 2-liter soda bottle works well) for their rabbits. Hot 
bunnies can curl up next to these bottles when temperatures get too high.
Aside from valuable hands-on experience, members of 4-H rabbit projects can 
also earn awards. Although actual awards and requirements vary from club 
to club, typical activities, such as displaying a winning rabbit-related project 
in the local 4-H fair or successfully exhibiting a rabbit at a show, can earn par-
ticipants medals, ribbons, or certificates.
 
Don’t get the impression that your kid can’t participate in 4-H if she has a 
mixed breed rabbit. If your bunny isn’t a purebred, your child can still show 
the animal in the 4-H showmanship class. In showmanship, the exhibitor pres-
ents the rabbit to a judge, demonstrating an understanding of rabbit care and 
anatomy as well as proper handling. Children are graded on their ability to 
present the animal properly and to understand their pet’s overall health. The 
breed of the rabbit is irrelevant.
No relation to the Swedish band: ARBA
When it comes to the big time in rabbit showing, the American Rabbit 
Breeders Association (ARBA) is the governing body. As the official organiza-
tion for rabbit showing and registration in the United States, ARBA sponsors 
rabbit shows, put on by regional rabbit clubs, around the country. Rabbit 
fanciers, serious about showing, attend these shows, which are usually for all 
breeds of rabbits but are sometimes open only to one breed.
ARBA maintains a list of rules and regulations for rabbit shows, and each 
sanctioned show operates by these rules. Officiating the ARBA shows, judges 
evaluate the rabbits using the breed standards published by ARBA. Rabbits 
that are exhibited at ARBA shows may be registered with the organization, 
but registration isn’t absolutely necessary.
 
Rabbits at ARBA shows are judged in classes organized by breed. Within the 
breed classification, rabbits are then divided up by age before they’re judged. 
Awards are given to individual class winners, as well as the best of
 
✓ Breed
 
✓ Opposite Sex (given to the best rabbit of the opposite sex of the Best of 
Breed winner)

232
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
✓ Show
 
✓ Variety or Group
Class winners usually receive a ribbon; Best of Variety or Group, a rosette (a 
type of ribbon); Best of Breed, a trophy; and Best In Show, a large trophy. 
Small cash awards are also given to some of the winners.
When competing in ARBA shows, rabbits can also earn legs toward their 
Grand Championship. Three legs qualify a rabbit as a Grand Champion, 
which is a distinctive title in the rabbit world.
Registering
Registering a rabbit isn’t necessary in order to show it. However, many 
people choose to do so because having a registered rabbit assures that the 
animal’s pedigree is true and that the rabbit meets all the requirements of 
its breed. (It’s interesting to note that you don’t need any solid proof that a 
rabbit is a purebred to show it. If the rabbit looks purebred, it’s assumed that 
the rabbit is purebred.)
 
To register your rabbit in the purebred classification, your bunny needs a 
three-generation pedigree). An official ARBA registrar must examine your rabbit 
and determine whether your bunny is eligible for registration. The rabbit must 
be 6 months or older and meet the senior weight limits for its breed. It must also 
be free from disqualifications as defined by its breed standard.
Getting some ink: Tattooing
If you’ve been to a rabbit show, you probably noticed that some rabbits have 
tattoos in their left ears. You may also see a registrar actually tattooing rab-
bits at the show.
For a rabbit to be shown, he must have an identifying number tattooed into 
its ear for many shows. The registrar tattoos the rabbit’s registration number 
in his ear at the time of examination. Many breeders do their own tattooing, 
using a system of letters and numbers that they’ve created for their own 
record-keeping purposes.
 
The procedure is painful for a rabbit, so the most humane method is to have 
an experienced vet do the procedure using an anesthesia. However, some 
breeders and show registrars will apply tattoos. (Your rabbit doesn’t need to 
be entered in the show for you to have his number tattooed at the event.)

Hitting the Road with Your Rabbit
In This Chapter
▶ Finding a smart and loving bunny caretaker
▶ Taking the first car ride home
▶ Going out into the wild blue yonder with Fluffy
▶ Making pet-friendly accommodations
You don’t have to live with a rabbit for too long before you find yourself 
completely bonded with your pet. Pretty soon, you won’t even want to 
leave your rabbit for extended lengths of time, even when you go on vacation! 
You’ll think that maybe he’d enjoy seeing the Grand Canyon. You’ll tell your-
self that he’s yearning for a look at Mount Rushmore, or maybe your aunt and 
uncle in Paris would like to meet him.
Well, don’t let your affection carry you away. The truth is that rabbits aren’t 
the greatest of travelers, and pleasure jaunts aren’t necessary or even 
healthy for most bunnies. (Sorry, but you’ll have share your travels with your 
rabbit by showing him your vacation slides.) The reason rabbits don’t travel 
well is simple: They’re easily prone to stress, and being exposed to new envi-
ronments stresses them out. They prefer the safety and comfort of familiar 
surroundings. Also, rabbits who travel are at risk of being exposed to dis-
eases and parasites — another reason why bunny is best off at home.
 
Take your rabbit only if the trip is absolutely necessary for him: trips to the 
veterinarian, relocations with you to a new home, and the like. This chapter 
helps you reduce your pet’s stress and keep him safe and sound when there’s 
just no getting around hitting the road together
Keeping Him at Home
Because traveling with your rabbit is a last resort, your first resort is to keep 
your pet at home. Rabbits take great comfort in familiar surroundings, and 
leaving your rabbit in his usual place with a responsible person (either some-
one whom you trust or a pet sitter) who can come by once or twice a day is 

234
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
your best option. Although leaving your rabbit in your house is better, board-
ing is also an option if you absolutely can’t find anyone to care for him. (See 
the section “Boarding your bunny,” later in this chapter.)
 
The most crucial aspect of keeping your rabbit at home while you travel is 
finding the right person to care for your pet. Get someone who is responsible 
beyond question because your rabbit’s life literally depends on this person 
while you’re away. If you have a friend or neighbor who you trust implicitly 
with your rabbit, you can go this route. If the person you’re considering is 
under the age of 12, make sure that a parent is overseeing your rabbit’s care.
 
Consider your
 
✓ Boyfriend or girlfriend
 
✓ Friend or neighbor
 
✓ In-laws (no outlaws)
 
✓ Parents or adult children
 
✓ Spouse
 
✓ Trusted member of your rabbit club
 
✓ Vet technician (some do pet-sitting on the side)
 
✓ Professional pet sitter
Preparing your pet sitter
 
After you hire someone to take care of your rabbit, you need to prepare your 
home and your pet for your absence:
 
✓ Go over your rabbit’s needs with the sitter. Invite your sitter over for 
a visit before you’re scheduled to leave. When she’s there, give a run-
through of all duties so that she can ask questions. This is also a good 
time for a rabbit handling and holding lesson. If it’s someone you know 
well and she can’t come before you leave, give specific instructions over 
the phone (or leave this book open to the page that talks about holding 
your rabbit!).
 
✓ Create a how-to list of all the rabbit chores and dos and don’ts. Even 
though you’ll have verbally instructed your rabbit’s caretaker on what 
she needs to do, it can’t hurt to write it all down and leave it in a place 
where your sitter can see it. Also let the caretaker know what she should 
do — or shouldn’t: Don’t let the rabbit run loose throughout the house, 
do give her supervised exercise in a rabbit-proofed room, do be on the 
lookout for signs of illness (consult Chapter 9 of this book), and so on.

235
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
 
✓ Stock up on supplies. Make sure that your rabbit’s caretaker has every-
thing she needs to care for your rabbit properly and knows where you 
keep this stuff. Have a supply of hay on hand so that your caretaker 
won’t need to scramble to find any and have fresh vegetables chopped 
up and portioned in bags, ready to go in the refrigerator. Make sure that 
you have enough litter for your rabbit’s litter box if your bunny uses one 
and have plenty of fresh bedding on hand.
 
✓ Make a list of foods. If you’re going to be gone for an extended period 
of time, your caretaker needs to go to the store to pick up fresh foods 
for your rabbit. Leave behind some cash or payment instructions for the 
caretaker, along with a list of foods that your rabbit can eat.
 
✓ Instructions for veterinary care. Post the phone number and address 
of your rabbit’s veterinarian in a prominent place, with a 24-hour emer-
gency clinic number and address alongside. Leave a signed note stating 
that you authorize the rabbit’s caretaker to seek veterinary attention for 
your rabbit in your absence and provide a means for the caretaker to 
pay for veterinary care. (The simplest solution may be to call your vet’s 
office and work out an arrangement in the event that your rabbit gets 
sick while you’re away.)
 
✓ Your contact information. Leave phone numbers (here’s where a cell 
phone is incredibly handy) and addresses where you can be reached 
while you’re away. Also leave the number of a local friend who’s willing 
to be responsible for your rabbit if you’re unreachable.
Going the professional pet-sitter route
Another route you can take is to hire a professional pet sitter. A professional 
pet sitter comes to your home to take care of your rabbit every day. That 
means she’ll feed your rabbit, give her fresh water, let her out of her cage for 
supervised exercise, and clean up after her. If you have other pets, you can 
have the pet sitter care for these critters, too. (If you do have other pets, let 
your sitter know whether your rabbit can safely be with your other pets.)
 
To find a reputable pet sitter, get a referral from another rabbit owner or your 
veterinarian. If you’re unable to get the name of a pet sitter in your area from 
either one of these sources, contact Pet Sitters International or the National 
Association of Pet Sitters, listed in the Appendix, for a listing of pet sitters 
near you. These organizations have standards that its members must meet. 
For example, they must be insured and bonded (see explanation in the follow-
ing bulleted list), have experience caring for animals, and be able to provide 
references, to name just a few requirements.

236
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
Before you hire a pet sitter, you need to interview her and ask some important 
questions. Most pet sitters want to come to your home to meet you and your 
pet, and this is the time to pose the following questions:
 
✓ What is your experience with rabbits? Have you cared for rabbits 
before? If you can’t find a sitter who has rabbit experience, then get one 
who interacts calmly with your pet and seems to have a natural feel for 
being around these sensitive pets.
 
✓ How much do you charge to care for a rabbit? Do you charge per day, 
per visit? These details can be important, especially if you’ll be gone for 
an extended period of time.
 
✓ How many times a day will you come see my rabbit? At what times 
of the day will you come? What services are available? For example, 
in addition to feeding and giving fresh water, will the pet sitter sit with 
your rabbit during exercise time? Will the pet sitter groom your rabbit? 
How much extra does the pet sitter charge for these additional services?
 
✓ May I see references? Preferably get several from other rabbit owners. 
Call each one of these people to find out whether they were happy with 
the pet sitter’s work. Ask whether the pet sitter is responsible, if she 
took good care of the animals in question, and whether the pet owner 
would recommend this pet sitter to others.
 
✓ Are you bonded? If a professional pet sitter is bonded, you, as the cus-
tomer, are financially protected against theft of your property perpetrated 
by the pet sitter. In other words, if the pet sitter steals something from 
your house, you’ll be reimbursed for it. Most professional pet sitters will 
also ask you to sign an agreement as to the services that will be rendered. 
A liability waiver may also be included in the agreement, holding the pet 
sitter free from certain responsibilities if anything happens to your pet 
or your home while the pet sitter is in charge. Read any agreement care-
fully before you sign it and make sure that you have no problem with the 
stipulations that the pet sitter has put forth.
Boarding your bunny
Another option for your rabbit while you’re away is boarding in a private 
home. Some people, for a fee, take in other people’s pets for short-term 
boarding.
 
Home-boarding is preferable to placing your rabbit in a boarding kennel or 
a veterinarian’s office, the kind that regularly services cats and dogs. Such 
places are generally not hospitable for rabbits because of the close proximity 
of all those barking dogs.
You can locate a rabbit-friendly boarding home through a rabbit club in your 
area. Contact the House Rabbit Society (see the Appendix for contact 

237
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
information) and ask for a reference to a House Rabbit Society chapter in 
your area. Your local club should be able to recommend someone in your 
area. In addition, contact your rabbit-experienced veterinarian’s office; they 
often have a list of qualified people who can board your pet.
 
When choosing a private boarding situation, make sure that
 
✓ You visit the home before you commit to leaving your rabbit in the pro-
prietor’s care.
 
✓ The home is clean.
 
✓ The rabbit’s quarters are secure, have all the comforts of home, and are 
safe from predators.
 
✓ You ask for references of other rabbit owners who have used the ser-
vices of this home-boarder and call them. Find out whether they had a 
pleasant experience and whether their rabbits came back happy and 
healthy.
Traveling with Your Rabbit
If you find that you absolutely have to travel with your rabbit, do it in a way 
that’s safe and comfortable for your pet.
Options for rabbit travel are usually limited: Cars and airplanes are the vehi-
cles in which rabbits are usually welcome. Whatever mode of transport you 
choose, the situation must be handled carefully to keep your bunny in good 
health — physical and mental — during the trip.
You also need to pack for your bunny. (I’ve yet to meet a rabbit who could 
close his own suitcase.) Packing the right items is vital to keeping bunny 
comfy while on the road. In addition, keep in mind these general dos and 
don’ts when it comes to bunny globe-trotting.
Travel dos
Before taking your pet on a trip, bear the following tips in mind: These bits of 
advice can make the difference between smooth travel and a cumbersome ride.
 
✓ Plan ahead. Think about the circumstances of the journey and how to 
best make your rabbit comfortable. (See the upcoming section “Carrier 
comfy” in this chapter.) If you’re flying with your pet, you need to con-
tact the airline to make reservations for your rabbit. For overnight road 
trips, plan ahead by making reservations at pet-friendly hotels.

238
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
✓ Get veterinarian information at your destination. Before your trip, get 
the name and phone numbers of rabbit veterinarians in the towns where 
you’ll be staying. If your rabbit gets sick, the last thing that you want to 
do is struggle to find a qualified veterinarian.
 
✓ Consider the weather. Think about how hot or cold it will be. Rabbits 
can tolerate cold much better than heat. If you’re traveling by car during 
the summer, be sure your air conditioning is working. If you’re traveling 
by plane, keep in mind that your rabbit may be exposed to extreme heat 
during loading and while in the cargo hold, and when it comes to rab-
bits, heat kills. A tip for potential hot-weather travel is to place a frozen 
water-filled plastic drink bottle in the carrier with the rabbit.
 
✓ Get a temporary tattoo. Using a nontoxic felt marker, write your tele-
phone number in your rabbit’s ears. This temporary ID will wear off but 
may come in handy.
 
✓ Use a travel carrier. Airline carriers, the best traveling case for a rabbit, 
come in different styles. (See what a travel carrier looks like in Figure 16-1.)

239
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
Travel don’ts
Make sure that you do follow these “don’ts.” Your rabbit and you will be far 
better off if you
 
✓ Never leave your rabbit alone in a car, even for a few minutes. A hot 
car is a death trap for a rabbit. Even if the windows are rolled down, 
the temperature in a sun-baked car can rise at a fast and deadly rate. 
Leaving a rabbit alone in a car (whatever the weather) can put the rabbit 
at risk for being stolen.
 
✓ Don’t skimp on a carrier. Don’t carry your bunny in a box or bag. 
Instead, use only travel crates or carriers designed for small animals. 
Plastic-and-wire airline crates are an excellent choice, although some 
owners prefer soft nylon carriers.
 
✓ Don’t fly. Avoid taking your rabbit on airplane trips, if at all possible. 
Airplane trips should be reserved for relocation situations only. Most 
airlines don’t allow rabbits to fly in the cabin of an airplane, which is the 
preferred way for a rabbit to fly. Rabbits who don’t fly in the cabin are 
relegated to the cargo area, where they’re exposed to life-threatening 
stressors, such as heat, barking dogs, and rough handling.
Packing a mean bag
If you’re planning an overnight trip, you need to pack a number of items for 
your traveling bunny. You need some of this stuff while you’re en route (if 
your trip is longer than an hour or so) and some after you arrive.
 
You can put all this fun stuff in a plastic bag or a canvas tote. Or you can go all 
out and get your bunny his own Samsonite. If you travel often with your pet 
and have a little money to spend), you can purchase a nylon pet travel bag or 
knapsack at a pet supply store.
Here’s what you need:
 
✓ Food: If you won’t be traveling through an area where hay and fresh 
vegetables are readily available, you need to pack these items for your 
trip. Bring a cooler, fill it with ice and the fresh, washed food your rabbit 
needs. Bring hay in a plastic bag to help keep it fresh.
 
✓ Water: Don’t upset your bunny’s digestive system by giving him 
strange water. Pack some bottled water and give that to him on 
your trip.

240
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
 
✓ Litter box and litter: If your rabbit is trained to use the litter box, bring 
his litter box along. He’ll take comfort in being able to use his familiar 
commode when nature calls.
 
✓ Bedding: Bring fresh bedding (whatever you use at home) for your 
rabbit if you’re staying overnight. He needs his bedding changed every 
day. (See Chapter 5 for information on rabbit bedding.)
 
✓ Chew items: Your bunny takes comfort in gnawing on some favorite 
item while he’s traveling.
 
✓ A toy or two: When your bunny gets to where he’s going, help him accli-
mate to his new environment with a familiar toy.
 
✓ Harness and leash: Bring your rabbit’s harness and leash with you so 
that you can take him out of the carrier when necessary and still have 
complete control over him. Chapter 12 tells you about the harness and 
how to use it.
 
✓ Grooming tools: If you’ll be gone for a week or more, bring your rabbit’s 
brush and nail clippers. If you have a longhaired rabbit, even an over-
night trip requires that you groom your pet during your trip, so bring 
along your grooming tools. Chapter 7 tells you all about grooming and 
its required tools.
 
✓ Rabbit vet’s contact information at your destination: If you planned 
ahead, you’ll have this info ready when it’s time to go.
 
✓ Identification: Equip your rabbit’s carrier with an ID tag bearing your 
name, address, and cell-phone number. Include the phone number of 
your destination in case your rabbit becomes separated from you during 
the trip.
 
✓ Paper towel rolls: Use for cleanup of cage or hotel room if needed.
 
✓ Carpet cleaner and white vinegar: Use for cleaning in case of an accident.
 
✓ First-aid kit. Bring along your bunny’s first-aid kit so that you’ll be equipped 
should he become sick or injured. (See Chapter 9 for information on 
gathering the necessary first-aid supplies.)
 
Your rabbit’s carrier is his home away from home, but you don’t need to 
bring your pet’s entire cage with you. Think of his carrier as his traveling cage.
Carrier comfy
 
Before taking your rabbit on a trip, help him get used to his carrier. The more 
comfortable he feels in his travel carrier, the less stressed out he’ll be when 
he travels. This whole process can take up to a month, so be sure to start way 
ahead of your scheduled departure time.

241
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
First off, make sure that you have a good carrier for your bunny. The best 
ones for rabbits are the small airline approved plastic-and-wire carriers nor-
mally used for cats. Rabbits find these cozy because they’re enclosed, and 
the construction helps protect the four-legged occupants in the event of an 
accident. You can also opt for a soft nylon pet carrier bag, although it doesn’t 
provide as much protection during car travel and rabbits can more easily 
chew through them.
Take the following steps to familiarize your rabbit with his carrier:
 
1. During your bunny’s exercise time, place the carrier in the area where 
he runs around.
 
 Put some clean straw in the carrier, or your rabbit’s sleeping blanket 
inside. Leave the door open and place some treats inside. After your 
rabbit eats the treats, add more goodies about half an hour later.
 
2. After a few days of eating treats in his carrier, close the door while 
your rabbit is inside.
 
 Keep the door shut for just a minute or two at a time and then let him 
come out if he wants to. Gradually increase the amount of time the door 
is closed until your rabbit is confined for at least half an hour.
 
 If your rabbit shows distress at being confined, you’re moving too fast. 
Back up and start over by putting treats in the carrier and leaving the 
door open. Gradually begin to close the door for short periods of time 
until you work up to a comfortable confinement time for your rabbit.
 
3. After your bunny is okay with being inside his carrier with the door 
closed, take him on some short car trips.
 
 When he first feels the car moving, he may become distressed. If he 
does, have someone else drive while you sit in the backseat with him. 
Feed him some of his favorite treats through the carrier door and talk 
softly to him. Keep the trips short and gradually work up to longer car 
rides as he becomes more comfortable.
When your rabbit is completely comfortable confined to his carrier and trav-
eling in the car, you’re ready for your trip. Your carrier (or car) should be 
equipped with the items mentioned in “Packing a mean bag,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Bunny you can drive my car
If your rabbit is just taking a short trip to the vet, you’ll mostly likely be trav-
eling with him by car. That’s a no-brainer unless, of course, you live in a big 
city and don’t have a car, instead relying on public transportation. If that’s 
the case, call a car service or hail a taxi for a ride to the vet. Avoid subways 

242
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
and buses with your rabbit if you can. The noise and commotion will scare 
him and are best avoided. (Check ahead before taking your rabbit on public 
transportation. Some cities don’t allow pets on trains and buses, even if they 
are in a carrier.)
Another reason why you may be traveling by car with your rabbit is to move 
to a new home — an excellent reason to take your rabbit on a car trip. If you 
move, your rabbit moves with you.
 
Keep the following points in mind when traveling by car with your rabbit:
 
✓ Keep your rabbit in a secured (safety belted or otherwise) carrier 
while in the car. This is for your safety as well as the safety of your 
rabbit. In the event of an accident, your rabbit is safer in a carrier. 
Also, a loose rabbit can be distracting to a driver and can actually be 
the cause of an accident. Be sure to get your rabbit used to his carrier 
before taking him on a trip. (See the section “Carrier comfy,” earlier in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Face your rabbit’s carrier to the side instead of from front to back of 
the car. This way, if you have a sudden stop or take off, your rabbit is 
less likely to be thrown forward into the carrier door, where he may 
break a tooth. A piece of carpet place in the carrier will help prevent 
your bunny from sliding.
 
✓ Skip the scenery. Your bunny will not enjoy seeing glimpses of the world 
speeding by. Cover his carrier with a towel so that he won’t become pan-
icked by the surrounding sights (kind of like blinders on a horse).
 
✓ Protect your rabbit from heat.
 
• Use the air conditioner if you’re driving in hot weather.
 
• Make sure that your rabbit’s carrier is not in direct sun. Move the 
carrier to the other side of the car’s seat or put a towel over the 
area of the crate that’s exposed to the sun. (Be sure to leave some 
open areas for ventilation.)
 
✓ Provide healthy air. If you get stuck in traffic, keep the windows rolled 
up and the air vent closed, preferably with the air conditioner turned on.
 
✓ Take breaks on long trips. If you’re driving for a long time (more than 
a couple of hours), stop and give your rabbit a break. Park in the shade 
if the weather is hot and let him hop around inside your parked car, 
making sure that you block off any areas in the car where the rabbit can 
become wedged or hide. Be certain he has fresh water in his carrier and 
clean up any accidents that may have occurred while he was confined.

243
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
Flying the unfriendly (for bunnies) skies
Traveling by plane is the least favorable way to get your rabbit from one place 
to another. Consider the following as you think about whether to subject your 
rabbit to a flight:
 
✓ Airports are places of crowds, long waits, and security checks—all of 
which are stressful to humans, let alone a trapped and terrified bunny.
 
✓ Very few airlines actually allow rabbits to travel in cabins; most require 
that rabbits fly in the plane’s cargo hold (where checked bags are kept). 
There rabbits are exposed to noise, usually other animals, and great 
fluctuations in temperatures. There’s also the risk of being exposed to 
heat if the plane gets trapped on the runway for an extended period of time.
 
✓ The rare airlines that do allow rabbits to fly in cabins require that car-
riers fit under passengers’ seats (which is physically not possible with 
larger rabbits).
 
If your rabbit must fly by plane, certain precautions can help your pet survive 
the stress of the trip. Follow these guidelines if you’re planning a plane ride for 
your pet:
 
✓ Fly with your rabbit. Avoid sending your rabbit alone on a plane. 
Without you on board, the rabbit has no one to watch out for him. If the 
plane gets trapped on the runway for hours on end, your rabbit could 
die of heat exhaustion.
 
✓ Book a direct flight to reduce the amount of handling your rabbit has 
to endure. A connecting flight increases the chances of circumstances 
going awry in your pet’s journey. More than one dog or cat has been 
Bunny’s first trip home
Your bunny’s first car trip may be the one he 
takes to your home. When that time comes, 
follow the car travel guidelines in this chapter 
and then consider the following tips to make the 
journey especially stress free:
 ✓  Have someone (or yourself) sit next to the 
bunny’s travel carrier or cage, comforting 
her by speaking softly and using her name.
 ✓  Keep windows closed and radio off to elimi-
nate scary noises.
 ✓  Go directly home! Do not take any detours 
along the way — not even to introduce your 
new companion to your mother.
 ✓  Drive carefully to avoid sudden stops or 
sharp turns that could throw your bunny off 
balance.
Once you arrive at home, your bunny will need a 
quiet place to relax and adjust to her surround-
ings; Chapter 11 offers more details on this 
important transition.

244
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
incorrectly routed and ended up in the wrong city. Also, ask for your 
rabbit to be loaded last, after all the checked bags have been placed in 
the cargo hold. If your rabbit goes in last, he’ll be unloaded first when he 
arrives at his destination.
 
✓ Get your rabbit a place in the cabin. Most airlines allow only one or 
two pets to fly in the cabin of the plane, as long as the pet’s carrier fits 
under the passenger’s seat. Again, not all airlines allow rabbits in the 
cabin. Call ahead to ask. In order to secure a place in the cabin for your 
rabbit, make your reservations way ahead of time.
 
✓ Do not sedate your rabbit for the flight. In the event of heat or another 
problem with your pet’s flight environment, tranquilizers can send your 
rabbit over the edge. While sedatives may sound like a great idea, you 
should use these drugs only under constant veterinary supervision, as 
reactions to these drugs in stressful situations can be unpredictable.
 
✓ Prepare your rabbit for the flight by making sure that he’s completely 
comfortable in his carrier. Follow the steps in the “Carrier comfy” section, 
earlier in this chapter, to get your rabbit used to being confined in an 
airline carrier weeks before you take your flight.
 
✓ Prepare your rabbit’s crate so that your bunny has everything he 
needs during the flight. If your rabbit is flying in the cargo hold, equip 
his crate with his favorite towel or blanket, a gravity water bottle 
attached on the inside of the crate door filled with fresh water, a 
good amount of fresh hay, and favorite fresh veggies to help him stay 
hydrated.
 
✓ Clearly mark the outside of the crate with contact information. Put 
more than one person’s information in case of an emergency and 
friendly information, such as, “Hi, my name is Thumper, and I’m a lop-
eared rabbit. I’m traveling for the first time, so please treat me gently.” 
This type of note catches the attention of the handlers. Also, put a tag 
on your pet’s crate with your name, address, and cell-phone number, 
along with care instructions in the event your pet becomes separated 
from you.
 
✓ Make sure that you have appropriate health certificates. All airlines 
and state health officials require a USDA (United States Department of 
Agriculture) health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian prior to 
travel. Airlines vary on how far in advance they want health certificates. 
Certificates for interstate travel are generally good for 30 days. (Again, 
that’s decided by the destination state in question.). It’s best to check 
with your airline on their exact requirements.
 
✓ If you absolutely have to put your rabbit on a plane without you, book 
your pet’s flight in the cooler weather for his safety. In other words, a 
December trip from New York to Chicago would be a better bet than a 
summer trip from California to Texas.

245
 Chapter 16: Hit ting the Road with Your Rabbit
 
✓ Use a professional pet shipper, if necessary. You may have to book 
your rabbit’s flight through a professional pet shipper if the airline 
doesn’t allow pet owners to make pet reservations (see the Appendix for 
more information).
Being a law-abiding bunny
 
If you’re taking your rabbit out of state or the country or flying on a plane, call 
the agricultural authorities where you’re going at least 6 weeks in advance to 
find out the regulations regarding rabbits in that area. You may need a USDA 
health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian before you can bring a rabbit 
into the area, or you may find that you can’t bring rabbits into the area at all.
You can go online to the animal welfare section of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Web site at www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/pet_
travel/pet_travel.shtml for more information on government regula-
tions on interstate and international travel with pets.
Some places, such as Hawaii and the United Kingdom, have strict quarantine 
restrictions, requiring that rabbits spend considerable amounts of time in a 
quarantine facility when they’re first brought into the area. This separation 
ensures that they’re free of illness before mingling with the rest of the rabbit 
population. Find out whether the place you’re going has these kinds of rules 
and what following them entails.
Staying at a Five-Carrot Hotel
These days, hotels have spas, room service, and Internet access. What else 
do you need? Your rabbit! Who cares if a mint is on your pillow if you can’t 
stay there with your pet? If you have to stay somewhere overnight, you need 
to find a bunny-friendly hotel along your route. Not to worry — plenty of 
them are out there.
 
Be prepared to pay a pet deposit, which is refunded if your room is void of pet-
related damage after you leave. You may also have to pay a small fee (usually 
$5 to $15 per night) for the privilege of keeping your pet with you for the night.
Booking a reservation
The best way to find the right hotel or motel is to use a pet-friendly hotel/
motel guide. A number of these books have been published for hotels and motels 
around the United States. Although not labeled specifically for rabbit owners 

246
Par t IV: Enjoying Your Fun Bunny 
(some even refer only to dog-friendly places), the pets-okay policies at these 
lodges are often applicable to rabbits as well. (Refer to the guides listed in 
the Appendix.)
 
If you don’t want to go to your bookstore and purchase a guide, you can do 
research on the Internet. By simply typing “pet-friendly hotel” in any search 
engine, you get a list of Web sites to the kinds of places you’re looking for.
After you find the listing, call the hotel to make sure that rabbits are indeed 
allowed. Don’t count on that hotel or motel having available rooms on the 
night you plan to stay. Book while you’re on the phone to make sure that you 
have a place to stay — don’t just show up with bunny in tow!
Being a good guest
When you stay at a pet-friendly hotel or motel with your rabbit, be a good 
guest. The impression you leave on the manager and staff is vital because it 
determines whether future rabbit owners will be allowed to bring their pets 
to this facility in the future.
 
Follow these guidelines when staying in a hotel or motel with your rabbit:
 
✓ Control your pet. Don’t let your rabbit run amuck in a hotel room. 
Rabbits are inclined to dig carpet, poop and pee under the bed, and 
chew on the wooden furniture if left to their own devices. By all means, 
give your rabbit some exercise but keep a close eye on him to make sure 
that he doesn’t damage the room.
 
✓ Clean up after your pet. If your rabbit has an accident on the rug, clean 
it thoroughly. Scoop up any hay or litter that spills out of your pet’s car-
rier. Avoid using room towels to clean up pet messes. If you didn’t bring 
paper towels along with you (tsk, tsk!), run to the store and buy some if 
you need them or get a bunch of paper napkins from the hotel restaurant. 
(Chapter 5 tells you how to get rid of urine on the floor.)
 
✓ Confine your rabbit. This one is for the safety of the room and your 
pet’s safety, too. Whenever you aren’t in the room, keep your rabbit in 
his carrier. You don’t want the maid to accidentally let your pet out of 
the room, and you certainly don’t want your rabbit destroying carpet 
or furniture or disappearing into the box spring or some other nook or 
cranny.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part is a hodgepodge of information. These 
chapters tackle knowing when you should take your 
rabbit to the vet, pronto. On the fun side, ten of the best 
rabbit Web sites are listed as well as ten ways to brighten 
your bunny’s day.

Chapter 17
Ten Signs That Require 
Emergency Action
In This Chapter
▶ Coping with a pet emergency
▶ Knowing when to rush to the vet
▶ Discovering the signs of a sick rabbit
Just like other pets (and people, too) rabbits can require emergency 
treatment. An illness or injury may mean that your rabbit needs immediate 
help, even before you take him to a veterinarian. Of course, everyone knows 
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So if you want to do right 
by your rabbit, check out Chapters 9 and 10 for more health information and 
some preventive medicine.
 
Suddenly seeing that your bunny is sick or injured can be pretty scary. 
Thinking straight in these kinds of situations is often difficult. Before taking 
any action:
 
✓ Stay calm.
 
✓ Consult your emergency cheat sheet. Using the sheet provided in the 
front of this book (you should have already filled this out and posted it 
by your telephone), check for the address and phone number for your 
vet clinic, as well as the phone numbers for a 24-hour emergency pet 
hospital and ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center.
One way to keep calm is to prepare in advance for an emergency. This 
chapter helps you figure out how to handle the most common rabbit 
emergencies. If you ever find that your rabbit needs emergency care, you 
may be surprised at how well your memory serves you.

250
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Blood in Urine
 
Red blood in the urine is a serious sign of disease. Causes include uterine 
disease (in females), bladder stones, bladder cancer, and trauma to the 
bladder. Blood that appears at the end of urination and as a separate puddle 
is most likely caused by a uterine problem. Excess blood loss can be a life-
threatening condition. Bloody urine should be reported to your veterinarian 
immediately, particularly if it is associated with
 
✓ Straining to urinate
 
✓ Frequent urination
 
✓ Weakness
 
✓ Depression
 
Normal rabbit urine can range in color from yellow to rusty orange due to 
pigments produced in the bladder and from the plants the rabbit eats. 
However, blood in the urine is distinctly red. If you’re in doubt about your 
rabbit’s urine color, take a sample to your veterinarian for evaluation.
Diarrhea
True diarrhea in the rabbit is characterized by stool that is
 
✓ Profuse
 
✓ Watery
 
✓ Sometimes bloody in the absence of normal stool
 
Diarrhea is most often caused by a serious disruption of the flora normally 
in your rabbit’s gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the pet will become 
dehydrated and go into shock. If your rabbit has diarrhea, don’t attempt to 
treat it yourself. Take your bunny to a veterinarian as soon as possible. A 
serious disease of the GI tract — not a change in diet — causes diarrhea.
 
Rabbits can also develop soft, pudding-like stools often mixed with normal 
hard, round droppings. These stools aren’t true diarrhea, and although they 
do represent a disease of the gastrointestinal tract that should be addressed, 
it’s not a dire emergency. This condition is most often related to diet.

251
 Chapter 17: Tens Signs That Require Emergency Action
Excessive Salivation
Dental disease is the most common cause of excessive salivation. If the rabbit 
is drooling because of dental disease, it means he’s in pain, and the condition 
should be attended to as soon as possible. Other possible signs of dental 
disease can include
 
✓ Not eating well
 
✓ Quickly losing weight
 
✓ Constantly wet fur around the mouth and neck
 
Excessive salivation can also be caused by certain types of poisons. If this 
condition is accompanied by generalized weakness, you need to seek veterinary 
attention immediately.
Poisoning
Rabbit owners do their very best to keep dangerous plants and chemicals 
away from their furry companions, but accidents happen. A long list of plants 
(see Chapter 8), as well as lead, pesticides, and household chemicals can be 
toxic to rabbits. A rabbit that has eaten something poisonous can be affected 
in ways that range from stomach upset to death. Symptoms may include
 
✓ Diarrhea
 
✓ Seizures
 
✓ Drooling or foaming at the mouth
 
✓ Ulcers in the mouth
 
✓ Weakness
 
✓ Burned lips, mouth or skin
 
✓ Abnormal mental state
Keep in mind that some toxins (daffodils, for example) can cause delayed 
symptoms, so take action even if your rabbit seems fine. Whenever possible, 
bring the suspected poison with you if your vet recommends you go to the 
emergency room. Be sure that your emergency Cheat Sheet (a handy 
tear-out included in the front of this book) includes the phone number for a 
reliable Animal Poison Control Center (for example, the ASPCA Animal Poison 
Control Center, at 1-888-426-4435).

252
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Heatstroke
Rabbits are susceptible to heatstroke and can tolerate cold weather better 
than hot. A hot and humid day can be all it takes to send a rabbit into heat 
exhaustion, even a rabbit who lives indoors without air conditioning. See 
Chapter 5 for information about housing tips for preventing heatstroke. Signs 
of heatstroke include labored breathing, extreme lethargy, and an elevated 
body temperature.
 
If your rabbit has been exposed to high temperatures and you suspect she’s 
suffering from heatstroke, do the following to help her cool down:
 
1. Get her out of the heat and into an air-conditioned or shady area.
 
2. Wrap her ears in a cool, wet towel.
 
3. Rush her to a veterinarian immediately.
Labored Breathing
A variety of serious problems can cause labored breathing (visible difficulty 
moving air in and out of the lungs) in rabbits. Anything from pneumonia to 
shock to heatstroke can cause labored breathing.
 
Labored breathing in a rabbit is a serious emergency. Rush your pet to a 
veterinarian as soon as possible. If it’s hot outside, run the car air conditioner 
first because hot air is difficult for the rabbit to breath and will cause further 
difficulties.
No Stool
If a rabbit doesn’t produce any stool for 24 hours, particularly if any of 
the following signs accompany it, he’s in need of immediate medical 
attention. The most common cause is a complete or partial obstruction to 
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or a complete shutdown of the GI tract caused 
by a chronic GI motility problem.

253
 Chapter 17: Tens Signs That Require Emergency Action
 
✓ Bloated abdomen (may feel tight or like it’s filled with fluid, like a water 
balloon)
 
✓ Constant tooth grinding
 
✓ Dull appearance to the eyes
 
✓ Hunched posture
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Reluctance to move
 
✓ Weakness
 
This is a dire emergency, so seek medical attention immediately. These 
conditions are fatal within 48 hours if left untreated. If an obstruction is 
present, your rabbit needs emergency surgery.
Pain
If your rabbit is in pain, he should be rushed to a vet immediately to 
determine the cause of pain.
 
The following are signs of pain in a rabbit:
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Excessive salivation
 
✓ Frequent grinding of the teeth (Occasional tooth grinding can be 
normal.)
 
✓ Inability to sleep
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Rapid or labored breathing
 
✓ Reluctance to move
 
✓ Sitting in a hunched posture all the time (particularly with dull, 
half-closed eyes)
 
✓ Unexplained aggression
 
✓ Unusual body posture

254
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Injury
Rabbits can get hurt in a variety of ways, such as when other animals 
attack them. When being handled improperly, rabbits are often hurt, and 
when really frightened, they’ll do anything to escape — including injure 
themselves. (Chapter 7 helps you understand how to properly handle your 
rabbit.) If you didn’t see the injury occur, you may not be certain as to what’s 
wrong. Look for the signs of injury described in the following sections.
Bleeding
Bleeding can result from a predatory attack or from catching the skin on a 
sharp surface.
 
If your rabbit is bleeding profusely, put pressure on the wound using your 
hand or finger with a clean gauze pad or small towel. Try to stop or slow the 
bleeding.
If the blood is coming out in a steady flow, the injury is less serious. If the 
blood spurts out in rhythm, your rabbit has a damaged artery. In the latter 
case, stopping the blood flow is difficult, and more pressure and time is 
required. Meanwhile, try to get your rabbit to an emergency veterinary 
facility.
Broken bone
Broken bones occur from some type of trauma. The fracture causes pain, and 
if it occurs in the legs, the rabbit might limp or drag or hold his leg up. If the 
fracture is in the spine, you’ll see dragging (usually the hind legs) or difficulty 
standing. Most fractures occur under the skin, but sometimes the bone can 
protrude through the skin, causing bleeding and increasing the possibility of 
infection.
 
All fractures should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible, because 
your pet is in great pain with this condition. Prepare a small deep box or 
carrier with thick blankets or towels padding the bottom and gently place 
your pet inside. Try not to jostle the rabbit’s body unless absolutely necessary. 
Doing so may cause further injury. Do not splint or immobilize the fractured 
leg because the rabbit may struggle with pain, causing more damage. The 
rabbit will get himself in the position that is most comfortable for the ride.

255
 Chapter 17: Tens Signs That Require Emergency Action
Burns
Rabbits who manage to nibble on electrical cords can be seriously burned or 
electrocuted. If you find a cord that’s been chewed on or through, check your 
rabbit carefully — in particular for burns of the mouth — and call your vet 
immediately. Any rabbit found unresponsive near a chewed cord should be 
taken to a vet right away.
Paralysis
An inability to move two or more legs can be paralysis — the result of a 
spinal injury. If your rabbit is conscious but unable to move part or all of her 
body, gently place your rabbit on a folded towel and blanket. Then carefully 
place your bunny, still lying on the towel and blanket, in a large carrier or 
open box.
Head Tilt and Seizures
 
Head tilt is a neurological emergency that you might encounter with your 
rabbit. (See Chapter 9 for more on this condition.) As the name suggests, the 
primary symptom is a rabbit holding her head to the side. The quicker head 
tilt is diagnosed and treated, the greater chance for full recovery. Even if your 
rabbit is only showing mild signs of head tilt, you need to have her checked by 
your veterinarian as soon as possible.
Head tilt can be caused by an inner ear infection, trauma to the head, or a 
problem in the brain due to stroke, cancer, infection, parasitic disease, or 
other disease. Onset of head tilt symptoms can be gradual or fast. A rabbit 
with head tilt may also not interact as usual, hide in a dark corner, stop 
eating normally, or stop eating at all.
Seizures can be frightening to see. A rabbit who is having a seizure lays on 
his side, jerking and twitching uncontrollably. Even though it appears that 
she’s struggling, remember that the rabbit is unconscious during these 
moments and isn’t feeling any pain. Try covering the head and body of the 
bunny loosely with a lightweight towel to cut out visual stimulus and light, 
which may help shorten the seizure. Gently lift the rabbit and place her in a 
large carrier or open box that’s been fitted with a blanket, towel, or other soft 
material.
 
Do not restrain the rabbit while she’s convulsing because you may cause 
further injury. Do not put your hands near her mouth.

256
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Sudden Weakness
Any number of problems, all serious, can cause sudden weakness. 
Heatstroke, blood loss, shock, overwhelming infection, neurological disorder, 
intestinal obstruction, poisoning, trauma to the spine or legs, and metabolic 
diseases are just a few of the conditions that result in weakness.
If your rabbit can’t stand up, don’t try to force him. Instead, to make him 
comfortable, place him on a towel or blanket and take him to the veterinarian 
immediately.

Ten Ways to Make Your 
Bunny’s Day
In This Chapter
▶ Adding a healthy dose of fresh foods
▶ Having a good time, bunny style
▶ Trying bunny massage
▶ Spending quality time together
S
ure, the demands of life can be overwhelming, but not so much that you 
can’t take a few moments to do something special for your rabbit. Not 
only will you strengthen the bond you have, but you’ll show her just how 
much you appreciate her as a source of joy, comfort, and companionship.
In this chapter, we list some ways to put a hop, skip, and a jump in your 
bunny’s step. None of the things on this list require a great deal of money or 
time, but they pack a big punch in terms of bunny rewards. Give them a try 
and see for yourself.
Get Fresh
Feeding your rabbit the best, freshest diet of grass hay and greens is one of 
the most important things you can do to prevent a whole host of health 
problems. On top of that, fresh foods simply make bunnies happy!
Hay is probably the most important part of your rabbit’s diet, and not just 
any hay will do. Be sure to give your rabbit an unlimited supply of fresh, 
grass hay (Timothy, for example). Chapter 6 describes how you can tell if hay 
is fresh or past its prime.

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Fresh, moist greens, such as kale, parsley, endive, cilantro, and dark leaf 
lettuces, do a great deal to maintain a healthy rabbit intestine. Experiment 
to see which greens are a hit. Try a new vegetable, whether it’s one you’ve 
grown in your garden or one from the market. Better yet, plant an organic 
garden devoted entirely to your bunny and let him graze as he chooses 
(safely, of course).
 
Speaking of fresh, don’t forget to give your rabbit fresh water every day.
Take a Peek
It may not be pretty, but your rabbit’s urine and waste droppings can tell 
you a lot about what’s going on with her health. (See Chapter 9 for more 
information.) For example, changes in urine color or urination habits may be 
sign of dietary changes or disease.
Changes in size and consistency of droppings can indicate a gastrointestinal 
problem. Soft stools (not the normal cecotropes) are often caused by a diet 
too low in fiber and/or too high in carbohydrates. Diarrhea, with no formed 
droppings and watery feces, is a different story, most likely a serious or even 
fatal condition. Call your vet right away.
Get Fit
Your rabbit needs plenty of exercise and free time out of her cage. She needs 
at least three to four hours of time to hop, run, and play. Not only is exercise 
a fun diversion for your rabbit, it also helps prevent obesity, sore hocks, poor 
muscle tone, problems with gastrointestinal and urinary function, and even 
behavioral problems.
If your rabbit is like many humans and doesn’t seem naturally inclined to 
exercise, take a look at Chapter 14, which describes a bunch of games and 
homemade toys that may help bring out the athlete in your bunny.
Breathe Some Fresh Air
This book makes it clear that outdoor living is not ideal for domesticated 
rabbits (cold, heat, predators, disease, and so on), but a bit of fresh air does 
wonders for us all, including house rabbits. (Before you embark on any sort 
of outdoor excursion, check out the safety precautions outlined in Chapter 8.)

263
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Bunny’s Day
Once you’ve provided a safe (and supervised) outdoor environment, you’ve 
opened up a whole new world of sensory experiences for your rabbit. Think 
about the fun your rabbit might have in a patch of garden, an outdoor run, or 
a portable exercise pen. New smells? Yes! New snacks? Yes!
Check on Health
Make it a part of your daily routine to handle your rabbit and check for any 
unusual discharge, lumps, sores, or skin problems. (Chapter 9 includes a 
checklist for home exams.)
 
Make a point of taking your bunny to a great veterinarian at least once a year 
for a check up. Don’t balk at the cost; there’s a good chance that an annual 
check up may prevent you from an emergency (and costly) situation.
Make Time for Playtime
Rabbits of all ages need playtime, both for mental and physical reasons. Not 
only will playtime keep bunny muscles strong and bodies limber, but it will 
keep their minds stimulated and engaged.
A bored bunny is an unhappy bunny! Rabbits love to play games and play 
with toys. They’ll play with you, other rabbits, and other pets (safely, of 
course). Experiment with different games (see Chapter 14) to see which ones 
tickle your bunny’s fancy.
As for toys, it won’t take long to figure out what your rabbit likes. (The toys 
he destroys or throws around the house are his favorites!) It can’t hurt, 
however, to rotate toys into the mix or try something new.
Listen to Your Rabbit
In nature, rabbits communicate with each other using sounds and body 
movements. Listen to what your rabbit may be saying to you: clucks, purrs, 
and snorts all have meaning (“that was delicious,” “I’m feeling good,” and “I’m 
so annoyed”).
Watch her body language for subtle (and not-so-subtle) messages. Chapter 11 
describes many of the common moves and what they might mean: chinning, 
leaping, presenting, kicking, and head butting. Enjoy!

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Schedule Spa Time
Squeeze in an extra grooming session. Brush out loose hair, check and trim 
nails, and check ears for mites or other problems. Short (or long) grooming 
sessions are great for bonding as well as another way to stay in touch with 
what’s going on with your bunny’s body.
If your rabbit appreciates petting, consider a gentle massage in the morning 
or evening. It may take some time to find the best location; I’d suggest a fluffy 
towel on a table or the floor. In the same way, you may need to experiment to 
find the technique that best suits your bunny, but here’s a start. (Begin with 
a few minutes and work up to longer as he becomes more accustomed to the 
routine.)
 
1. Wash your hands and gather up a towel and small spray bottle of 
water.
 
2. Point your rabbit’s face away from you and move your hands down 
his body, from face to hind end; repeat this step up to four times.
 
 Keep one hand on the bunny at all times to help him feel secure and 
safe.
 
3. Stroke gently between your rabbit’s nose, around the eyes and down 
the back of the head and then softly stroke the ears from the base to 
the tips.
 
 (Remember to always be mindful of any sensitive areas.) By now your 
rabbit should have relaxed.
 
4. Start making small circles with your thumb along the right side of 
your rabbit’s spine (never on the spinal bones!), working your way 
down from the shoulder area to the hip; repeat on the left side.
 
5. Finish with another three or four sweeps of your hand from the head 
to hind end.
 
6. Spray your hands with a mist of water from the bottle, then sweep 
down the body once again, removing the loose fur.
 
 Offer a fresh veggie treat as a reward!
Clean Up
Get serious once a week about cleaning. In addition to your daily chores, 
thoroughly clean and disinfect your rabbit’s digs and accessories once a 
week to keep her in good health.

 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Bunny’s Day
Spend Quality Time
Your rabbit craves a social life, so do what makes her happy. For some rab-
bits, happiness means petting on the couch; for others, a mutual grooming 
session on the floor, or just sitting near each other while you read or talk 
on phone. Whatever her fancy, make time for these special moments during 
each day.
