Nick Haurauz has directed and filmed a host of celebrities such as Nelly Furtado, Lady 
Gaga, and Richard Branson. He was responsible for crafting video magic for clients such as 
Diageo, Virgin Mobile, United Way, and Procter and Gamble.
He has an uncanny ability to engage his students and create a level of relatedness that  
keeps them coming back for more. As an FCP X, Motion 5, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and 
an Avid-certified trainer, he is able to put his BA in Film and Sociology from the University of 
Toronto to good use.
In 2005, Nick founded Inconscience Productions and continues to work with domestic and

opportunity of a lifetime to co-edit a feature documentary entitled My Father and the Man  
in Black; the untold story of a bad boy Johnny Cash, his talented but troubled manager,  
Saul Holiff, and a son searching for his father in the shadow of a legend.
When he is not busy impressing his students at Witz Education and travelling to or from  
post-production conferences, this half Ukrainian, half Trinidadian can be found playing tennis.
This is his first book!

Preface
Creating motion graphics and visual effects in the past used to be a daunting process. 
Performing tasks such as animating text, match moving, compositing, and connecting 
individual layers would involve extremely long workflows that would take days, even months 
to complete. That's where Motion comes in. It was designed to make these tasks simpler and 
easier so that the user can focus on the creation. The application works seamlessly with Final 
Cut and has the editor and motion graphics artist in mind every step of the way.
So, welcome to Apple Motion 5 Cookbook. Throughout this book, you'll learn to create 
sophisticated motion graphics using the incredible tools and content inside the application. 
Through a series of recipes, we will cover tips and tricks for easy navigation of the interface, 
animating layers with behaviors and keyframes, applying filters, using Motion's vast content 
library, creating replicator and particle systems, and working in both 2D and 3D environments.  
With exercise files accompanying this book as an additional download, you will walk away  
with real-world projects to apply your new skills to. Let's get cooking!
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Getting Around the Interface, explores becoming more comfortable inside Motion 
and navigating ourselves through the various windows.
Chapter 2, Looking at Motion's Library, explores working with and manipulating the vast 
content available to us right inside Motion.
Chapter 3, Making It Move with Behaviors, explores instant animation techniques by dragging 
and dropping various behaviors onto elements into our project.
Chapter 4, Making It Move with Keyframes, explores classic animation techniques in Motion 
and the options available to add, cut, copy, and manipulate keyframes on parameters.
Chapter 5, Let's Make Text, explores working with text in Motion by changing text style, saving 
presets, and animating text with behaviors.

Preface
2
Chapter 6, Paint and Masks, explores the Paint Stroke tool and the brush stroke presets 
available from the Library. We will also look at using masks to add effects to specific parts  
of our image, as a utility tool and to create animation.
Chapter 7, Let's Make Particles, explores the basics of Motion's extremely powerful particle 
systems and how we can manipulate its parameters to create dynamic motion graphics.
Chapter 8, Replicators – It's No Fun By Yourself, explores the basics of the replicator and how 
almost any element in Motion can be used to create seamless animation through patterns.
Chapter 9, Motion Tracking and Keying, explores VFX techniques including match moves, 
offset tracking, and green screen removal.
Chapter 10, Intro to 3D, explores adding cameras and lights to our projects to interact with our 
elements in 3D space.
Chapter 11, Publishing Your Work to FCP X, focuses on integrating Motion into FCP X by 
creating titles, transitions, effects, and generators for the Media Browser.
Chapter 12, Customization and Exporting, explores a few customization techniques for various 
workflows. We also look at exporting movies, stills, and image sequences from Motion and 
exporting through another application called Compressor.
What you need for this book
Users will need three applications to go through all the recipes in the book; Motion 5,  
Final Cut Pro X, and Compressor. These applications only run on Apple computers. All 
applications can be downloaded directly from the Mac App Store located on the dock  
of your computer. Please head to the Apple website in order to make sure you have the 
appropriate system requirements to run the applications. The Motion webpage can be  
found here: http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/motion/. If you already have  
the application installed, make sure you are up to date with the latest software. All  
project files that you can download from the Packt Publishing website are compatible  
with Motion 5.0.7 and higher versions.
Who this book is for
This book is intended for Final Cut Pro users looking to incorporate more motion graphics in 
their workflows and Motion users who are looking to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the 
tools, tricks, methods, and options available in Motion to create great motion graphics and 
visual effects.

Introduction
Welcome to Apple Motion 5 Cookbook! We've all got our reasons for being here. It could be 
the awesome $50.00 price tag that got us excited. Maybe it was a 30-second motion graphic 
intro we saw on television last night and want to duplicate, or the effects and transitions we 
love to work with in FCP X that we want to customize just a little more. Whatever the reason, 
one thing remains true; Motion 5 is a deep, powerful, and flexible application for a variety 
of creative workflows and the reason you're here is to learn how to better utilize it. Motion 
5's interface can be a bit overwhelming the first time you open it, but with a little knowledge 
about how it works out of the gate, the better prepared we will be to focus on the good stuff; 
making our projects dance!
Choosing a Motion project
What do we want out of Motion 5? Where do we want our projects to live? How big should  
it be? The minute we launch Motion, we are presented with a lot of choices. Let's take an  
in-depth look at some of those options.
How to do it...
1.	 To launch Motion, click on the application icon on your Dock or double-click it from 
the Applications folder.
Downloading the example code
You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have 
purchased from your account at http://www.packtpub.com. 
If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit  http://www.
packtpub.com/support and register to have the files e-mailed 
directly to you.
The high resolution colored images of the book can also be found in 
the code bundle.
2.	 Upon entering, we are presented with a welcome window called the Project Browser. 
It can be divided into three sections. On the left-hand side, we have the option of 
starting with a recent, blank, or pre-existing composition (this is where we can find 
our preinstalled Motion templates). Since this is our first time here, make sure Blank 
is selected from the list, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1
7
3.	 In the middle, we can choose between five projects. Motion Project is usually chosen 
when we want to start and finish our work solely in Motion. If we choose Final Cut 
Effect, Generator, Transition, or Title, we are telling Motion that when we save our 
project, we want to make it available in Final Cut. Depending on the type of project 
you select, it will save in the corresponding section in FCP X's Media Browser, as 
shown here. For now, make sure Motion Project is selected.
www.it-ebooks.info

4.	 On the right, you can choose from a variety of different presets depending on the 
material you're working with or where you're exporting. Say your footage was shot in 
Europe with a DSLR camera. You could choose a Broadcast HD 1080 setting with 
a Frame Rate value of 25. The duration could match the length of the files you're 
bringing in and you could choose to display it as timecode, frames, or seconds. For 
this exercise, let's choose the Broadcast HD 720 setting with a frame rate of 29.97 
and a 6 second duration. Press Open.
5.	 The Motion interface launches and we're ready to bring in some media to work with.
There's more…
Here's a little more information on the different types of Motion projects and the attributes 
associated with them.
Motion templates
If you choose Composition from the left-hand side of the Project Browser window, you can 
choose from one of the pre-existing Motion templates available.
Motion and Final Cut Pro X were meant to work together.
Turning Motion Projects to Final Cut Generators
If you open Motion by choosing Motion Project, you can still make it available in Final Cut by 
going to File | Save As and then clicking Final Cut Generator from the dialog box.
Most of the parameters we see in Motion can be brought into Final Cut. In fact, we can even 
create rigs where a slider, checkbox, or pop-up widget can change several parameters at once.
Rigging and publishing
While saving a Motion project for use in FCP X is already powerful, nothing beats being able to 
take specific parameter controls from Motion's architecture and make them available inside 
FCP X. You'll learn more about this extremely powerful workflow in Chapter 11, Publishing Your 
Work to FCP X.
Project properties for Motion can be adjusted in the 
Project Properties menu.
Project Properties
If you choose the wrong project settings, don't worry; you can always go to Edit | Project 
Properties and change the preset, frame rate, and time display of your project.

Importing files to the Canvas, Layers tab, 
and Timeline
Motion 5 gives us several options to bring in the material we want to work with. Some of this 
material can be from Motion's own library.
For these recipes, we're going to use the File Browser to load in our material. Think of it as a 
gateway to our system and its files displayed graphically.
Getting ready
If it's your first time to Motion, here's a brief breakdown of the interface:
www.it-ebooks.info

Getting Around the Interface

The Motion workspace can be broken down into the following sections:
f
f
File Browser, Library, and Inspector: The left-hand side of the Motion interface 
contains three areas—File Browser, Library, and Inspector. You can click on the 
corresponding tab to see each area or use a keyboard shortcut. The File Browser 
is where you view the clips from your system and import them into your project. The 
Library allows us to see behaviors, effects, and tons of content directly within Motion 
that we can utilize for our projects. The Inspector is similar to the Inspector in FCP X. 
It allows us to change the parameters of a selected item.
f
f
Toolbar: This contains tools for creating content and manipulating elements in your 
project. There are tools for creating shapes, manipulating cameras, and adding 
behaviors for automatic animation.
f
f
Canvas: This allows you to view the current frame your playhead is on. You can also 
manipulate layers visible in the Canvas. The Canvas contains playback and view 
controls for both 2D, as well as 3D workflows.
f
f
The Project pane: This pane contains the Layers, Media, and Audio tab, which

How to do it...
Before we begin, locate a clip on your system you would like to import into Motion or feel free 
to use a clip that comes with some of the later recipes. Launch Motion and choose a project 
based on the setting of your clip.
Follow these steps to import files to the Canvas:
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left-hand side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 Locate the movie file on you system that matches your project's settings.
3.	 With the clip selected, drag it from the File Browser straight to the Canvas window 
but don't release your mouse.

4.	 By default, as you hold your clip you should see yellow lines appear. These are 
called dynamic guides. You can turn them on and off by going to View | Overlays | 
Dynamic Guides. These guides can help you align your video directly to the center of 
the Canvas.
5.	 Wait until you see both the vertical and horizontal guides. When you do, release your 
mouse as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 If your video seems too big, press Shift + Z to fit it into the Canvas window.
This is how we can import files to the Layers tab:
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left-hand side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 Locate the movie file on your system that matches your project's settings.
3.	 With the clip selected, drag it from the File Browser straight on top of the empty 
group in the Layers tab.

4.	 Wait for the plus icon and release your mouse, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 The video should appear directly centered in your Canvas window, If your video seems 
too big, press Shift + Z with the Canvas window selected to make it fit.
Follow these steps to import files into the Timeline:
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left-hand side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 Locate the movie file on you system that matches your project's settings.
3.	 With the clip selected, drag it from the File Browser straight to the Timeline. Press 
the Shift key to help it snap to the playhead, but don't release the mouse.

4.	 Eventually a menu will appear asking us whether we want to composite or insert our 
images into the Timeline. Since there is nothing in our project, both options do the 
same thing. Choose Composite, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 The video should appear directly centered in your Canvas window. If your video seems 
too big, press Shift + Z with the Canvas window selected to make it fit.

It also acts as the location to which any file will go when you bring it into the project based on 
the default settings. Be aware of where your playhead is and know at what time your media 
starts. You can also change Motion's Preferences setting to always have layers created on the 
first frame of the project.

The Importing Photoshop and Illustrator files recipe.
Importing Photoshop and Illustrator files
We can import Adobe Photoshop (.psd) and Illustrator (.ai) files using any method from the 
previous recipe, but sometimes we may want more from these files. For instance, Motion can 
allow us to work with individual Photoshop layers but we need to import it in a specific way.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1
15
Getting ready
Locate a Photoshop file (PSD only) and Illustrator file (AI only) to use in the upcoming recipes.
From the File Browser, navigate to the Photoshop .psd file on your system, preferably one 
with multiple layers.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to import Photoshop files to Motion:
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 With the .psd file selected, drag it from the File Browser straight to the Canvas or 
the Layers tab without releasing your mouse.
3.	 By default, a pop-up menu appears allowing you to choose from merging the 
Photoshop file, selecting one of the individual layers, or importing all layers.
4.	 Choose Import All Layers, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 If your video seems too big, press Shift + Z to fit it into the Canvas window.
www.it-ebooks.info

6.	 You may notice that the Photoshop file has all of its layers contained within a group 
(named after the Photoshop project) of a group (the default group for the Motion 
project). It's good practice to release the Photoshop layers from the Photoshop group 
and have them solely within the Motion group.
This is how we import Illustrator files:
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 With the .ai file selected, drag it from the File Browser straight to the Canvas  
or the Layers tab and release your mouse. You cannot see an Illustrator file's 
individual layers.
3.	 If your video seems too big, press Shift + Z to fit it into the Canvas window.
4.	 At first, everything looks fine, but as soon as we start scaling the file we'll notice 
some deterioration of the graphic. Press F1 to navigate to the Properties tab of the 
Inspector. Locate the Scale property and scale up the image by double-clicking on it 
and entering a new value. Keep scaling till you notice pixelation.
5.	 Vector-based images from Illustrator are supposed to allow us to scale up the image 
to infinity and beyond. The problem is the minute we put the file in Motion, it places 
the file into a pixel-based world. To have this infinite scaling opportunity, we need 
to tell Motion to not give this file boundaries or take away its fixed resolution. To do 
this, navigate to the Media tab and select the AI file from the list; use the following 
screenshot for reference:

how crisp it looks.

Making selections with Expose 
Sometimes when you try to make a selection from the Canvas window, things can get 
frustrating. You'll want to select an item, but because images overlap quite often, Motion gets 
confused and will select the wrong image. Say hello to Expose. Expose will break apart all of 
your layers temporarily and allow you to easily select what you need. Let's see it in action.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion and select the Swarm template category. Under the Swarm category, 
select the Swarm-Menu template and click Open a copy.
2.	 Move your playhead to 5 seconds.
3.	 What you really want to do is select the background, but because of all the 
foreground elements it's difficult to get to. Press X for expose.

4.	 Notice how all your layers have been separated in the Canvas, and can be easily 
selected as you hover over them with your mouse. Find and select the Background 
Menu, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 The Canvas view goes back and the background is selected.
Changing the layer order
In 2D projects, layer order matters. Let's say we had a project with three backgrounds. The 
background that would appear at the top of the layer stack is what we will see. The other two 
layers would be invisible.

How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 01_05 project.
2.	 There are three gradient layers in this project but in the Canvas we only see the You 
can see me layer. Select this layer and drag it underneath the I'm hidden too layer 
without releasing the mouse. Make sure you see a blue line with an icon and not the 
plus symbol, as shown in the following screenshot. If you do, drag with your mouse 
slightly to the right and then release your mouse.
3.	 Notice that you can now see the I'm hidden layer being displayed. Select the I'm 
hidden too layer and drag it above the I'm hidden layer.
4.	 The I'm hidden too layer should now be seen.

The Groups versus layers recipe
Groups versus layers
Whenever we add a layer to our Motion projects, it has to be contained in a group. But 
what exactly is the difference between layers and groups? Well, for one thing, a layer is an 
element—a picture, movie, text object you've brought in or created. A group is a container for 
those elements. It can be used to organize materials in your project or perform operations to 
several elements at once. For those of you who use Final Cut Pro X, you may be familiar with 
compound clips. Compound clips allow you to reverse render operations or make universal 
changes to several objects at once. Let's take a brief look at some of the fundamental 
differences between groups and layers in this following exercise.
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 01_06 project by double-clicking on it.
2.	 There is one group that contains a circle and a square. Click on the Library tab.
3.	 Select Filters | Distortion | Bulge and compare your results to the  
following screenshot:
4.	 Notice how the bulge only affects the rectangle. Press F3 to open up the Filters tab 
of the Inspector. Adjust some of the parameters to get a feel for what it does.

5.	 Select the Bulge filter and drag it from Rectangle to Group. Notice how the bulge 
now affects both the circle and the rectangle, as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Delete Bulge by selecting it and pressing Delete.
7.	
Select the Circle layer and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector.
8.	 Drag the Scale slider to the right up to 150, or double-click on the scale number and 
manually type it in, as shown in the following screenshot:

9.	 Go to the Edit menu and select Undo until you get back to 100.
10.	 Select the group and press F1 to go to the Properties tab if needed. Drag the  
Scale slider up and notice how both the circle and rectangle increase in size,  
as shown here:
How it works
A default group was created with the Motion project. If you want to create a group in Motion 
from multiple layers, you can select them; just go to the Object menu and select Group.  
There is also a plus icon at the bottom of the Layers tab, as shown in the next screenshot. 
This creates an empty group above the selected group. If nothing is selected, the group goes 
to the top of the Layers tab.

I cannot stress enough that it pays to learn your keyboard shortcuts. It will allow you to 
perform tasks more quickly and efficiently instead of going to menus.
In this recipe, you went to the Edit menu to undo your last action. If you look under that menu, 
you will see that the shortcut key is Command + Z. This is one of the shortcut keys that isn't 
only good in this application, but on the majority that run on your OS system.

Making changes in the Properties tab, HUD, 
and Canvas
Motion is all about allowing you to make changes to the elements in your project. Some of 
these changes will be animation tweaks while others will be regular scaling and repositioning 
tasks. Let's take a look at a different way of changing the scale and position of a still image.
How to do it...
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, navigate to the File Browser by clicking it on the 
left-hand side of the interface, or press Command + 1.
2.	 Locate a still image file on your system that is large enough for your project's settings.
3.	 With the still selected, choose Import from the top of the File Browser.
4.	 Select the still image in the Layers tab and press F1 to go to the Properties tab  
of the Inspector.
5.	 Adjust the Position, Rotation, and Scale settings of the still to your liking.
www.it-ebooks.info

Getting Around the Interface
24
6.	 Click the reset arrow at the top of the Transform section to reset all of the properties, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
If your photo was larger than your project's properties, it may now be larger than  
your Canvas. Motion's default method when importing photos is to scale them  
down to fit the project. When you reset a still image, it goes to its original scale  
value. If this is the case, all you need to do is scale the photo down until it fits  
nicely in the Canvas window.
8.	 With the photo selected, go to the Window menu and select Show HUD:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1
25
9.	 The Head Up Display (HUD) is a semi-transparent floating window that shows certain 
properties of a selected layer, filter, or behavior. In certain instances, it provides us 
with quick access to some of the most used parameters of the current selection. In 
the case of this still, it gives us Opacity and Blend Mode. Adjust the Opacity value to 
around 80. Go to the Edit menu and choose Undo.
10.	 With the still selected, notice the bounding box around your photo. If you can't see it 
because the photo is full-frame, press Command + - to zoom out on your Canvas. We 
can manipulate several Transform category properties directly in the Canvas, and this 
bounding box allows us to do just that.
11.	 Drag any side corner of the image and scale the image down. Notice how the image 
doesn't scale uniformly unlike how it did in the Inspector. Press Command + Z  
to undo.
12.	Hold down the Shift key and grab the side corner again. Notice how the image scales 
uniformly. Press Command + Z to undo.
13.	 Press F1 to open the Properties tab of the Inspector. Hold down the Shift + Option key 
and click the side corner again. Scale the image downwards while paying attention to 
the Inspector. Notice how the scale updates. Also notice that by pressing Shift + Option 
not only does the object scale uniformly, but it also scales from the center.
There's more...
Some of you may have noticed the i icon at the upper-right hand corner of the HUD, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
By clicking it, we got to the Inspector. Whenever you work in Motion and the HUD doesn't have 
what you're looking for, go to the Inspector for more options.
www.it-ebooks.info

Getting Around the Interface
26
Also, when we held down the Shift and Option modifier keys, we were able to scale our photo 
uniformly from the center. The general rule is this: modifier keys can make our life easier when 
trying to manipulate properties in the Canvas and the HUD.
For example, if you try to rotate your image in the Canvas by dragging the circle to the right of 
the center and hold down Shift, we can force our still to move in 45 degree increments.
In the HUD, sometimes when you try to adjust properties, the slider moves too fast. If you  
Option + click the line, you can then move properties in smaller increments.
Moving and trimming layers in the Timeline 
and the mini-Timeline
So eventually as Motion graphic designers, we're going to have to animate stuff and part of 
that battle lies is our ability to move around and adjust layers efficiently in the application.
There are two ways by which we can adjust the timing as well as trim layers in Motion—by 
using the Timeline and mini-Timeline. The big question is why choose one over the other. As of 
Motion 5, both areas are displayed as soon as you enter a project. The Timeline will show all 
of your layers and the relationship those layers have with one another, spread over time.
The mini-Timeline only shows the selected element from the Layers tab (that is, filter, 
behavior, clip, and so on).
The Timeline is great for making timing adjustments when they revolve around the relation 
of one layer to another. On the other hand, the Timeline can become a very busy place, very 
quickly. The mini-Timeline is a great place to focus in on the selected item at hand. Let's have 
a look at adjusting layers in both the areas.
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 01_08 project.
2.	 There are two groups in this project; a text group and background. Press the Space 
bar to play the project.
3.	 This animation was done with behaviors, which we'll explore in Chapter 3, Making It 
Move with Behaviors. Simply, one text layer fades in after another. Before fixing the 
timing of the text, you may have noticed that the text appears off alignment. Click on 
the Disclosure tab for the Text group and click on the THREE layer and Shift + click the 
ONE layer. From the Object menu select Alignment | Distribute Vertical Centers. Your 
text is now distributed evenly.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1
27
4.	 In the following screenshot, you can see the order of our number layers in the 
Timeline. We want to change the order of the layers by fading in the first layer, 
followed by the second, and the third. We're going to make our first change in the 
mini-Timeline. To hide the Timeline temporally, go to Window | Timeline. Select the 
THREE layer, and from the Mark menu, choose Go To | Selection In Point. We want 
ONE to begin at 1 second. Select ONE and drag the layer's in-point value until it reads 
00:00;01:00.
5.	 Move your playhead to the beginning of the Timeline by pressing the home key or  
Fn + ← on a laptop. Play the animation. While the ONE layer now fades in at the  
same time as the THREE layer, you'll notice that it cuts off at the end. Drag the  
ONE layer's out-point in the mini-Timeline so it lasts till the end of the project.
6.	 Let's finish the rest our work in our Timeline. Press Command + 7 to toggle back to 
the Timeline.
7.	
Let's move the THREE layer to where the TWO layer ends. Drag the THREE layer while 
holding down the Shift key. Wait for its in-point to snap to the TWO layer's out-point 
and then release the mouse.
8.	 Make sure nothing is selected by pressing Shift + Command + A. Type 2, followed by 
the return to move to the two-second mark. Select the TWO layer and press I to trim 
its in-point to the playhead.

9.	 Press the home key and then the Space bar to check if the timing works. Use the 
following screenshot to guide you:

You can move your playhead by entering in numeric values. It's a good habit to make sure no 
layer is selected before attempting this operation. Press Shift + Command + A. Now, press  
Shift + = + 1 + . followed by Enter to move the playhead one second forward. Press – + 1 + .  
and hit Enter to move the playhead one second back, and press 5 + . and hit Enter to move  
the playhead to approximately five seconds.
You can move layers the same way you move your playhead. Select the layer you want to move 
in the Timeline and press Shift + =, or the minus symbol, followed by the number of frames or 
seconds you want to move it by.
Launching and customizing a template
One of my favorite things to do when I first started learning Motion was to open some of the 
templates the application shipped with and try to figure out how it was created. This gave me 
a real feel for the inner workings of Motion and the possibilities! Let's open one of Motion 5's 
templates and customize some of the features.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1

How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion from the Dock or the Applications folder.
2.	 From the left-hand side of the Project Browser, choose the Skyline template folder.
3.	 Select the Skyline Menu project, and from the bottom-right hand side, choose Open 
a copy.
4.	 Press Shift + Z in the Canvas window to fit the project and press the Space bar to  
play it back.
5.	 The project starts off with a radial background where buildings and a ribbon grow 
from offscreen to onscreen followed by a few titles fading in over top of them. After 
reviewing, we've decided we'd like to change the color of our background, the color 
of the ribbon, and put in some text to suit the project better. Move your playhead to 
an area where you can see all of your elements onscreen, or double-click in the Time 
field and enter 3.25.
6.	 In the Layers tab, reveal the content of the Background Group by clicking the 
disclosure triangle. You will see a single layer that is a still image; it has a radial 
gradient, as shown in the following screenshot:

Since this is a still image from another application, we have to add a filter to change 
its color. Press Command + 2 to go to the Libraries tab of the Inspector. Go to the 
Filters category, select the Color Correction folder and locate Colorize (use the 
following screenshot as your guide). Drag it to the Background Elements layer. Press 
F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector. Control-click the Remap White value and 
select a blue color of your liking.

Background group. Click the disclosure triangle to reveal the content of the  
Graphics group and the Ribbon group, as shown in the following screenshot:
9.	 The Ribbon group is composed of three rectangle objects that have behaviors 
animating them onscreen. While we can locate the original rectangle shapes and 
tweak their color, it's a lot easier if we add a filter to the group and change the color 
for all the elements within that group. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library tab. 
Go to the Filters category, select the Color Correction folder, and locate Colorize. 
Drag it to the Ribbon group in the Layers tab, as shown in the following screenshot:

slightly off yellow color from your previous selection.
11.	 Click the disclosure triangle to close the Graphics group. Open the Text group. There 
are five text elements, one for each text line onscreen. To change the text, select the 
Title here group. Press F4 to go to the Text tab of the Inspector. At the bottom, change 
Title info here to Motion 5. Repeat this step for the subtitle layers. The following 
screenshot shows the Format Pane tab in the Inspector for the Subtitle group:

the keyboard. Click on the Keyboard Set menu and choose Duplicate. Rename  
the keyboard to your liking.
3.	 Click on the letter A. Notice that in the Key detail field, all the commands associated 
with A show up. One of them is Record Animation. Notice that it's color coated, 
allowing us to see what category it belongs to under Command List. The A key in  
FCP X is the selection tool. Let's remap our keyboard to reflect that in Motion.
4.	 Click on the Record Animation field in the No Modifier column and drag it out of the 
box until you see a puff of smoke; now release your mouse.
5.	 In the Command List, choose Tools. Locate the Edit tool and drag this to the Key 
Detail | No Modifier section of A. Now, click Save.

it works from its default settings. Let's look at a few key preferences we can change which 
may be able to assist us in our workflows.
How to do it...
1.	 With a blank Motion project open, go to frame 10 of your project by clicking  
Shift + the right arrow.
2.	 Press Command + 2 to open the Library tab.
3.	 Navigate to the Content folder near the bottom. Select Particle Images | AquaBall 
and click on the Apply button at the top of the window. The following screenshot 
shows the AquaBall image being added to the tenth frame in the mini-Timeline:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1

4.	 There are two default preferences at play here that we should be aware of. The first 
is that when you import a layer into Motion, it will always get added at the playhead 
position. When you're first starting to use the application, this can be very frustrating. 
Second, this was a still image and, by default, if you drag it 10 frames to the left, 
you'll notice it matches the length of the project. Let's change this now. Select the 
AquaBall image in the Layers tab and press Delete.
5.	 Go to the Motion menu and choose Preferences. Click on the Project tab.
6.	 Under the Still Images & Layers settings, notice that Default Layer Duration is set 
to Use project duration and Create Layers at is set to Current frame, as shown in 
the next screenshot. Set Default Layer Duration to Use custom duration and set the 
length to one second.
7.	
Set Create Layers at to Start of project.
8.	 Let's close the preference window. With your playhead still at 10 frames and the 
AquaBall visible in the Library tab, apply it to the project again. Notice its length and 
where it gets added, as shown here:

For instance, under the Canvas tab, the grid and ruler controls refer to items we can turn on 
under our View menu (View | Show Rulers and View | Overlays | Show Grid) to help us align 
objects in the Canvas.

Sequencing stills in the Timeline
Sometimes, it is beneficial to be able to grab a group of stills and have them sequentially 
laid out in the Timeline with the click of a button. This recipe explains how we can set up our 
preferences and select multiple photos and perform this recipe in a flash.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. Select a Motion project, set Preset to Broadcast HD 720p, Frame 
Rate to 59.94, and Duration to 20 seconds. Choose Open.

2.	 Go to the Motion menu and choose Preferences. Click on the Project tab.
3.	 Under the Still Images & Layers settings, notice that Default layer Duration is set to 
Use project duration. Change Default Layer Duration to Use custom duration and 
set the length to one second. Close Preferences.
4.	 Press Command + 1 to navigate to the File Browser and locate the  
Chapter 1 exercise folder.
5.	 Turn off the Collapse Image Sequences icon on the lower-right corner of the File 
Browser so you can see all the photos. You should see 20 photos displayed; change 
from icon view to list view, as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Make sure your playhead is on the first frame of the project. Click the first photo and 
Shift + click the last one.
7.	
Drag the photos into the Timeline and try to align it with your playhead while  
holding down the Shift key. Wait for the pop-up window, and choose Sequential,  
as shown here:

There's more...
At the start of this recipe, we chose to turn off Collapse Image Sequences when bringing in 
our photos. What happened is because some photos were named sequentially, Motion flagged 
this and thought we wanted to treat it as an image sequence. In the later chapters, we'll see 
how image sequences can be extremely useful in Particles and Replicator cells.

Managing the Layers tab
In some of the previous recipes, you may have seen that the Layers tab can become a very 
busy place. It's important as Motion graphic designers to feel comfortable where we're 
working. Let's look at a few tricks we can use to manage our Layers tab as we work in Motion.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. Under Composition, select the Pulse category and choose  
Pulse – Open. Click Open a copy.
2.	 The project has three groups comprising of various elements from the project. Press 
Command + 1 to close the File Browser and Command + 7 to close the Timeline, so 
that we can have a little more room to view our Layers tab.
3.	 Let's play back the project to get a feel for it. Press the Space bar. This project 
consists of four different views of our animating circles and pulses.
4.	 Let's look at this project a bit deeper. Go to the beginning of the project. Click the 
disclosure triangle for the Text Elements group, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Notice how the group is slightly less highlighted than the Camera Light Graphics and 
Background Elements groups. This indicates that at the current frame, this group 
doesn't exist. We get further confirmation of this by looking in our mini-Timeline and 
seeing the Text Elements group start a lot later. Press Shift + I to move to the in-point 
of the group.
www.it-ebooks.info

Getting Around the Interface
42
Notice how the group now becomes highlighted but the Subtitle layer does not, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 Drag your playhead forward until you see the word Subtitle onscreen or go to frame 
273. Notice it's now highlighted. Hit the disclosure triangle for the Subtitle group. 
Notice that there is a Sequence Text behavior on the text. (We will be going in depth 
with behaviors in Chapter 3, Making It Move with Behaviors, but right now think of 
it as what's causing the text to animate in). Sometimes when we add filters, masks, 
and behaviors to clips, our workspace in the Layers tab can get cluttered. We can 
easily turn off the visibility of these filters, behaviors, and masks at the bottom of the 
Layers tab. Press the gear icon (shown in the following screenshot) and notice how 
the Sequence Text disappears. Press it again so you can see it.
6.	 When we work, it's also advantageous to solo elements in the project. It allows us 
to focus our work rather than worry about hundreds of items. To see the layers in 
the Text Elements group by themselves, select it and click the square within the 
rectangle icon. Notice how the graphic disappears and the text moves slightly to the 
side. Click it again to unsolo it.
7.	
Close the Text Elements group and open the Cameras Light Graphics group. Notice 
there are four scenes in this group that correspond to the four circle and pulse 
animations that take place over time. Get a feel for when each scene starts and stops 
by looking in the Layers tab and in the mini-Timeline for when a group is highlighted.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1
43
8.	 Twirl open scenes four through one by clicking the disclosure triangle for each of 
them. This may cause some of the layers to go outside the view, and in order to see 
them you have to scroll. Instead, click the icon at the bottom-left of the Layers tab 
with the little head on it. Drag the slider to your right to resize the layers.
9.	 Close the Camera Lights and Graphics group.

Introduction
As motion graphic artists and editors, we are constantly looking for content to bring into our 
projects and compositions. Some of this content can come from an onset location that we want 
to manipulate, while other content we create on the computer, such as text. What's amazing 
about Motion is that it ships with a library of content you can use royalty free in any of your 
projects. You already have some of the content you apply to images on hand, while other content 
you can create and use from scratch. The best part is that usually you don't have to look any 
further than in the Library to create breathtaking, broadcast-worthy visuals for a variety of 
different situations. Let's dive in to see the vast richness available for our projects.
A brief tour of the Library tab
Motion's Library is very similar to Final Cut Pro's Media Browser. Unlike the File Browser 
where we import material from outside of Motion, the Library contains filters, behaviors, 
generators, content, and presets available within Motion. It also gives us a gateway to a few 
external application libraries, such as iTunes and iPhoto. In this recipe, we'll have an overview 
of the Library tab.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2
47
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. Set the Preset to Broadcast HD 720p, Frame Rate to NTSC-DV, 
29.97, and Duration to 10 seconds. Press OK.
2.	 Click on the Library tab located on the left-hand side of the interface. Take a  
second to look at all the categories that are displayed. Choose Behaviors. On the 
right-hand side, a list of subcategories display. Currently All is selected, and the 
content of that subcategory appears in the lower part of the window, as displayed  
in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library
48
3.	 At the bottom of the Library tab, click on the magnifying glass icon. Similar to 
Spotlight on the Mac OS, we can now search in the subcategory. Type in write on  
in the search field. All the behaviors in the subcategory disappear except for the  
Write on behavior, as shown here:
4.	 Click on the Content category. At first, it appears that there is nothing inside. The All 
subcategory does not show any items. This occurs because we haven't cleared our 
search results and it just so happens there is no item by the name of Write on in the 
Content category. Click on the x icon in the search field to clear it. Now over 1300 
items are displayed in the Content category. Click the spotlight icon again to close 
the search field.
5.	 Scroll down in the All subcategory until you can see Atom 01. Select it. In the upper 
part of the Library tab, a preview displays showing you it's animated:
6.	 Click on a few more items in the Content library to get familiar with some of the  
items available to you. In the next recipe, we're going to import some of them  
into our project!

Importing files from the Content library
In the previous recipe, we had a brief tour of the Library tab and learned how we can easily 
search, select, and preview items. In this recipe, we'll import a few items into our project and 
see how to use them.
How to do it...
1.	 You can continue from the project you created in the previous recipe, or if you're 
starting here, launch Motion. Set the Preset to Broadcast HD 720p, Frame Rate  
to NTSC-DV, 29.97, and Duration to 10 seconds. Press OK.
2.	 Click on the Library tab and choose the Content category. On the right-hand side, 
select the Background subcategory.
3.	 As the subcategory implies, these items are meant to be used as backgrounds in 
your project. To change the way these items are being displayed, use the icon on the 
bottom right-hand corner with four squares. All the backgrounds are now displayed as 
icons. We can change the size of them by clicking on the duration slider, as shown in 
the following screenshot (next to the magnifying glass icon):
4.	 Click and select a few of the items below to view them in the upper window. Find and 
select Chalkboard Scratchy.

5.	 Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of the Timeline and the group in the 
Layers tab is selected. Click on the Apply button at the top of the Library, as shown 
in the following screenshot, to set the selected background as the background of your 
project. Select the Canvas and press Shift + Z to fit the video in the window. Press the 
Space bar to play the project.
6.	 We can even import content from our library while we are playing back our projects. 
Make sure your project is still playing. In the Library, select the group in the Layers 
tab. In the Library, under Content, select the Symbols subcategory. Scroll down and 
select Radio Hazard, as shown in the following screenshot:

Applying a Glow filter to a layer
For those of you from Final Cut X, applying effects to your projects is probably second nature 
but many of you may not realize that the vast majority of the effects in the Media Browser 
come directly from Motion. At any time, if you Ctrl +click or right-click these effects, you would 
see an option to open a copy of it in Motion, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library

Let's see how easy it is to add a filter to a clip in Motion.
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's project folder, double-click and open the 02_03 project.. The project 
consists of an Aqua Ball from Motion's Content library. It has been scaled up in size. 
We want to add a filter to it. Make sure the Aqua Ball is selected in the Layers tab.
2.	 Click on the Library tab. Locate the Filters category and select it. Select the Glow 
subcategory. There are eight different glows to choose from, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2
53
3.	 Select the Light Rays filter and click on the Apply button at the top of the Library tab. 
The filter is now applied to the Aqua Ball.
4.	 With the Aqua Ball selected, press F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector. Notice 
how the Light Rays filter is attached to your image. It seems to affect the brightest 
areas of the Aqua Ball. First, let's play with the Mix slider by dragging it to 0 and 
slowly back to 100, as indicated in the following screenshot:
5.	 Experiment with each of the other parameter sliders to get a feel for the effect on the 
Aqua ball (threshold and radius have a greater effect than the other two parameters). 
I used 150 for Amount, 8 for Glow, and 2 for Expansion. The results can be seen in 
the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library
54
6.	 Turn the filter on and off to see the before and after of the results by clicking the blue 
square for the filter in the Layers tab.
There's more…
The magic of filters lies in our ability to keyframe them and create animation. Lucky for us, the 
majority of Motion parameters on filters are keyframable!
Keyframing filters
While the result of the previous example is a static effect, notice that if you hover your mouse 
over the right-hand side of any of the parameters in the Filters tab, a diamond shape pops 
up, as indicated in the following screenshot. Filters become even more powerful when we 
make variable changes to them over time. Keyframing is our tool for creating animation. Two 
keyframes at different places in time and with different values result in an animation. Filters 
can even be used as transitions between clips to create dynamic effects. We'll cover more of 
this in Chapter 4, Making It Move with Keyframes.
Don't sweat the filters
There are 132 filters in Motion's library! Don't sweat it if you don't know what each one  
does. Your desire to add filters and play with the parameters is all you need to discover  
all the options that are out there. So start exploring!

Copying filters and applying filters to a 
group
Motion 5 gives us incredible flexibility when we work with filters. By using simple copying and 
pasting procedures, we are able to easily move filters in between layers and groups.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2
55
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's project folder, open the 02_04 project.
2.	 The project consists of two Aqua Balls from Motion's library. One of them has a Light 
Rays filter on it, which we applied in the previous recipe. We would like to apply this 
filter to the other Aqua Ball, too.
3.	 Select the Light Rays filter in the Layers tab. Go to the Edit menu and choose Copy. 
Select the Aqua Ball without the filter and go to the Edit menu and choose Paste, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Let's add a blur filter to both the Aqua Balls as well. Rather than apply a filter to each 
ball, we can apply the filter to the group they're both in. Select Group 1 in the Layers 
tab. Click on the Library tab. Locate the Filters category and select it. Select the Blur 
subcategory. Select Defocus and click Apply. The Blur filter is now applied to both the 
Aqua Balls.
5.	 With Group 1 selected, press F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector. The 
Defocus filter is attached to your group. Change a few of the parameters to see if  
you can increase the blur. I changed the Amount value to 20 and the Shape value  
to Polygon.

Controlling the filter order
Like any good recipe, the order in which we follow steps can make or break the meal we eat. 
The same can hold true for filters in Motion. In some instances, if we apply one filter before 
another, it can have a very different result than if the order was reversed. Let's take a look at a 
simple example where this applies.
How to do it...
1.	 Navigate to this chapter's folder and open the 02_05 project.
2.	 This project consists of an Earth Transparent layer from Motion's Content library. 
Click the disclosure triangle to reveal its filters and press F3 to go to the Filters tab of 
the Inspector.
3.	 There are two filters on the layer. One filter was meant to colorize the earth map, 
while the other created a border around the map with a blue color. This problem 
arises because we added the Colorize filter after the Border filter, and this is 
affecting both the border and the layer. Select the Simple Border filter in the  
Layers tab and drag it up so that it's on top of the Colorize filter. Notice how the 
border now has its intended blue background, as shown in the following screenshot:

The power of cloning
In the previous recipe, we saw how easy it was to copy and paste filters from one layer to 
another or to a group. Sometimes in a Motion graphics workflow, it's necessary to duplicate 
layers. A problem can occur when we want to change the filters on these layers. Both the 
duplicate and the original layers would each have to be changed manually. If you begin to 
change or manipulate filters several times, this can become a very tedious process. This is 
where cloning comes in handy. Any changes we make to filters on the original layer, the clone 
will follow along. As an added bonus, it also allows for better performance in Motion. Let's take 
a look at an example in action.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the 02_06 project from this chapter's project folder. This project consists of the 
Arrow 01 group from Motion's Content library.
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library
58
2.	 Click on the disclosure triangle for the Arrow 01 group and reveal its content. Notice 
there are two filters on the group—a Colorize and Trail filter. Press F3 to go to the 
Filters tab of the Inspector.
3.	 Press the Space bar to play back the project. Notice how the Remap White value 
on the Colorize filter has been turned to blue, and also notice how in the Trail filter, 
eleven echoes have been created lasting for a duration of one second.
4.	 Select the Arrow 01 group in the Layers tab and go to the Object menu and choose 
Make Clone Layer, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2
59
5.	 Notice that a new layer has been created just above the Arrow group, as shown in 
the following screenshot. Select Clone and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of 
the Inspector. Change the Position X value to –400. Clones have independent Scale, 
Position, and Rotation properties from the original. Press the Space bar to play back 
and see the two arrows animate.
6.	 Stop the playback. Move to a frame where you can see both the arrows in the Canvas, 
or go to the one second and the thirty-fifth frame mark. Select the Arrows 01 group 
and press F3 to go the Filters tab of the Inspector.

7.	
Right-click or Ctrl + click the Remap White value and change the color to a red of 
your liking, as shown in the following. Under the Trails filter, set Echoes to 4.
8.	 Press the Space bar to play back the project. Notice how the clone adopts the original 
group's filter changes, and you only had to switch one set of values!
There's more...
When we move our layer's Position co-ordinates, it's a good practice to know what the  
values mean.
Grid 101
Having a basic understanding of how Position co-ordinates work in Motion 5 can come in 
handy. When dealing with the x and y positions, we can easily break down our screen into four 
basic quadrants. The quadrants hold either positive or negative values. Here is a breakdown 
of the grid system in Motion 5; the same holds true in FCP X:

Clones and switching sources
If we are working with one layer in a project that has clones and later decide there may be 
another element that works better in its place, we can actually swap out the source. See the 
following example. In Picture 1, there was a photo of chalk that was cloned and scaled lower 
in size. The still picture of the ruler replaced the chalk and its clone. To achieve this, the ruler 
was dragged on top of the original chalk layer. The clone simply follows suit!

The power of blend modes
When you're trying to develop looks for your images, blend modes can achieve exciting results. 
Blend modes are used in almost all imaging applications and truly are a foundation of motion 
graphics and compositing. While there is a ton of content about blend modes, such as Motion 
5's user manual, sometimes it's better to see for yourself and experiment with a still image. 
Let's take a look at a few examples.
How to do it...
Let's create a new project and add a still from Motion's library:
1.	 Launch Motion. Set Preset to Broadcast HD 720p, Frame Rate to NTSC-DV, 
29.97, and Duration to 10 seconds. Press OK.
2.	 Click on the Library tab. Go to the Content category and select the Images 
subcategory. At the bottom of the Library window, double-click the Traditions folder 
and select the Watercolor 02 still image. In the preview area, you can see that the 
project's size is 2048 by 1362. That's much larger than our 1280 x 720 project.
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library
62
3.	 Making sure your playhead is at the beginning of the project. Click on the Apply 
button to add the Watercolor 02 image to the project. We're going to experiment  
with a few different types of looks with this abstract image by duplicating it and 
changing one of the layer's blending modes.
4.	 With Watercolor 02 selected in the Layers tab, go to the Edit menu and choose 
Duplicate, as shown in the following screenshot. Select Watercolor 02 copy.
5.	 Click on the Properties tab of the Inspector. Under the Blending category, set Blend 
Mode to Multiply, as shown in the following screenshot. The Watercolor 02 copy 
image blends together with the original Watercolor 02 image. Multiply looks at the 
darker colors in both images and multiplies them together. To see the before and 
after result, in the Layers tab, click on the checkmark next to Watercolor 02 copy. 
Click the empty box to turn the copy back on.
6.	 In the Properties tab, drag the Opacity slider up and down to see how this can be 
combined with the Multiply blend mode. Bring the Opacity slider back up to 100.
7.	
Set Blend Mode to Add. Notice how we receive a different effect. Add looks at the 
brighter parts of the image and adds them together.
8.	 Experiment with different Blend Mode values and Opacity settings to get a feel for 
some of the possibilities.

The Applying a blend mode to a gradient recipe.
Customizing a gradient generator
Gradients are fun and easy to use. Some gradients in Motion can be applied to different 
types of objects. We can apply gradients to shapes, text, particles, and a variety of different 
objects to create cool looks. We can create other gradients from scratch. To do this, we need 
to generate the gradient.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. Set the Preset to Broadcast HD 720p, Frame Rate to NTSC-DV, 
29.97, and Duration to 10 seconds. Press OK.
2.	 Click on the Library tab. Go to the Generators category. There are several generators 
for you to choose from. Choose Gradient and click Apply. Go to the Window menu 
and choose Show HUD, if it's not already showing. Use the following screenshot  
for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Looking at Motion's Library
64
3.	 A great place to start customizing your gradient is by looking at the various presets 
that ship with Motion. Next to the word Gradient is an icon. Click it to reveal the 
gradient presets and select any random one. I choose Dusk as shown here:
4.	 Set Type to Radial. Press the I icon to go to the Generators tab of the Inspector. You 
can see that we have more options for our gradient here than in the HUD.
5.	 Click the disclosure triangle to the left of the word Gradient. Let's change the position 
of the radial gradient and then adjust its color setting.
6.	 Scrub the Start Y Value and drag it to -360. Set the Y End value to -1120.
7.	
In the gradient icon at the top, there are two parts to the line. The upper-most part 
contains the opacity tags for the gradient. The fact that they are both white means it's 
fully opaque. The bottom part contains the color stops for the gradient. Currently, this 
radial gradient consists of four colors. We're going to delete one of them. Click on the 
color tag on the left, drag it down, and release your mouse. You should see a puff of 
smoke quickly appear. Use the following screenshot for reference:

Adding a frame and changing a drop zone's 
content
Drop zones give us the ability to swap either video or a still in replace of a placeholder graphic. 
Drop zones are great in helping motion graphic designers automate their workflow. Let's say 
you have a news program that uses the same "Coming Next" animation every week, but the 
videos and still content in that animation constantly change. You can easily set up a drop 
zone, so that you can use that same graphic over and over again while literally dropping in 
video and stills to their respective places.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. Set the Preset to Broadcast 720p, Frame Rate to 29.97, and 
Duration to 10 seconds.
2.	 Click on the Library tab to open it. Go to Content. There are 1349 items to choose 
from. Click the magnifying glass at the bottom-left of the window. Type in Vertical.

3.	 Select any frame with an arrow in the middle of it and choose Import. Select the 
Vertical group and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector.
4.	 Decrease the Scale value to 50. Select the Vertical group and hit Command + D 
twice to make two copies.
5.	 In the Layers tab, select one copy and drag it to the left of the Canvas. Repeat the 
step for the other copy, but drag it to the right. We'll make sure they're precisely 
aligned in the next step.
6.	 Name each of the frames accordingly. Select all three and from the Object menu 
choose Alignment | Distribute Horizontal Centers. Go back to the Object menu  
and choose Alignment | Distribute Vertical Centers. Use the following screenshot 
for reference:
7.	
You may see that in the center of each frame, it says Drop Zone as long as the  
group is selected. Drop zones are meant to be replaced with stills or video clips.  
Let's add some sources to the drop zone. Click the disclosure triangle for one of  
the Vertical groups.
8.	 Let's navigate to our File Browser by pressing Command + 1. Make sure Collapsed 
Image Sequences is turned off, as shown in the following screenshot. Navigate to the 
cat pictures from this chapter's media folder. Select one you like.

9.	 Drag the picture from the File Browser onto the Drop Zone layer in the Layers tab 
and wait for the hooked arrow, as shown in the following screenshot. Release your 
mouse. Press F4 to go to the Image tab of the Inspector, if it's not already displaying.
10.	 Scale and position the image in the frame to your liking. A sample is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Drop zones in Motion publish over to FCP X!
Drop zones for FCP X
You may have noticed in FCP X that certain transitions and templates have drop zones. We 
can create drop zones in Motion from the Object menu in any of our projects, as shown in the 
following screenshot. On top of this, we can save our project as a title, effect, or generator and 
manipulate that drop zone directly in FCP X. So, if you have a recurring show with the same 
intro animation and you need to continually update certain video segments, drop zones are 
for you!
Anchor points
How does that image scale? It's all about the anchor point! To illustrate how anchor points 
work a bit more, try adding some text to you project by pressing the T key. Press Esc once it's 
entered to go back to the selection tool and then press F7 to show the HUD. Change the size 
of the text and notice that when you scale it up, it scales from the lower-left corner. Press 
Command + Z to undo. Change the text alignment to center and scale it up again. Notice how 
the text scales from the center. Alignment acts as a text's anchor point and determines how 
the object scales and rotates.

Introduction
If you've ever used FCP 7 or FCP X to animate the scale, position, or parameter of an effect on 
a video clip, you're probably familiar with the concept of keyframing. The idea of keyframing 
comes from the classical days of animation. A head animator would come in and draw two 
pictures, let's say a lizard at the beginning and end of a race. A junior animator would then 
be responsible for drawing every picture during the race. In Motion 5, consider yourself the 
head animator while Motion acts as the junior animator. Yet, on top of using keyframing as an 
option to animate, we also have behaviors.
Behaviors automate the keyframing process. In some cases, where we might have had to use 
hundreds of keyframes to mimic a reel-life simulation, we can use one behavior and change 
a few controls to perform that task immediately. In other cases, it aids us better than having 
to use keyframes, because certain behaviors have graphical user interfaces which help us 
visualize what they do. Behaviors are a very powerful motion graphics tool that will assist us 
throughout the animation process. They're also a ton of fun to use! Let's see some behaviors 
in action.
Applying a Fade In/Fade Out and  
Grow/Shrink behavior to a still
For those of you from Final Cut X, when in the Video tab of Inspector, we can easily set our 
Crop settings to Ken Burns and automatically get movement in our still images by setting the 
start and stop position for the effect. In Motion 5, these types of automatic animations come 
naturally when we use behaviors. Let's add some effects to a still and see it in practice.
Getting ready
Locate the exercise folder for this chapter on your computer. Choose the 03_01 project and 
double-click to open it in Motion. The project is just a still picture of a cat that has been scaled 
to fit an NTSC – DV project. We're going to have this photo grow over time by using a behavior 
to animate it.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
81
How to do it...
1.	 Press the Command + 2 shortcut to go to the Library. Navigate to Behaviors | Basic 
Motion | Grow/Shrink as shown in the following screenshot. Select the behavior 
and notice that in the mini-Timeline, it's the same length as your still (in this case 10 
seconds). We can always trim behaviors to be whatever length we want them to be.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
82
2.	 Navigate to Window | Show HUD. In the HUD, you'll see a square. Grab one of the 
corners and drag it outward. Notice that only one side gets scaled up as shown in  
the following screenshot. Press the Space bar to play back the animation. We can 
also see that the picture does not scale up uniformly. Press the Command + Z 
shortcut to undo.
3.	 Let the project continue to play while you make the next change. Drag any of  
the corners and drag outward to scale up. Notice how the photo animation moves 
quicker the more you drag out. Now drag the square inward until it is inside the 
smaller square as shown in the following screenshot. Notice in the Canvas how the 
photo scales down. The further you drag in, the faster it scales down. Isn't it amazing 
how we've managed to do this all in real time!
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
83
4.	 With the Grow/Shrink behavior selected in the Layers tab, press the F2 key to go to 
the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. You also have the option of dragging the scale 
slider. A negative number shrinks the picture, and a positive number makes it grow. 
Let's add another behavior to the clip. The Library is a good place to get familiar with 
material because you may have noticed that when you click on an object a preview of 
it plays in the top-left corner. But just like FCP X, in Motion there are a ton of ways to 
do the same thing.
5.	 Make sure the still layer is selected. Just beneath the mini-Timeline on the right-hand 
side, you'll see a gear icon. This is another area we can find behaviors and add them 
to clips. Click on it and navigate to Basic Motion | Fade In/Fade Out. In the HUD, 
notice how it comes with a 20-frame Fade In at the beginning and Fade Out at the 
end of the clip. Increase the Fade In by dragging the triangle to the right-hand side. 
Make it 30. Decrease the Fade Out to 10. Press the Space bar to play back your 
project if you stopped it.
There's more…
We can cycle through various effects on a layer by pressing the D key.
The D key
In older versions of Motion, the Heads Up Display (HUD) used to be called the Dashboard. If 
you have a lot of behaviors on a clip, with your HUD displaying, you can hit the D key to cycle 
through all the behaviors without having to click on them.

Real-time playback
One of Motion's greatest perks is your ability to adjust behaviors and animations while playing 
back your project. Just like editing, where it's best to make editing decisions while playing 
back your project, animation works the same way! You can see if your project is maintaining 
real-time playback by looking in the upper-left corner of the Canvas. Just keep in mind the 
minute we start adding several filters and behaviors, this will slow everything down and you'll 
need to create a RAM preview.

Customizing a Motion Path
The Motion Path behavior is very versatile. It creates a path for an object to travel along and  
is customizable.
How to do it...
1.	 Let's launch Motion and create a new Motion project with a Preset of Broadcast 
1080p. Set Duration to 6 seconds.
2.	 Press the Command + 2 shortcut to go to the Library. Go to Particle Emitters and 
select the Pulsing Laser Star as shown in the following screenshot. Click on Apply.

3.	 Press the Space bar to play back your project. It's a simple star that twinkles in the 
middle of your Canvas. We're going to make it travel along a path. Click the gear 
icon on the bottom-right corner of the Canvas and choose Motion Path under Basic 
Motion as shown in the following screenshot. Press the F7 key to show the HUD if it's 
not already displayed.
4.	 Zoom out on your Canvas by pressing the Command + - shortcut. Notice that with the 
Motion Path behavior selected, you can see a line in the Canvas that has two points; 
one point is in the center and the other is off-screen to the right-hand side. Press the 
Space bar to play back the project. Notice that the star travels from left to right.
5.	 In the HUD, change the value of Direction from Forward to Reverse. Make sure  
the project is still playing back. Drag the point offscreen to the lower-right corner  
of the Canvas and the middle point to the upper-left corner, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
87
6.	 While still playing back, change the value of Speed from Constant to Ease Both. The 
star now slowly goes out of the first point and then slows down when entering the  
second point.
7.	
Change the value of Loops to 3 and the End Condition to Ping-Pong. Press the  
Shift + z shortcut to make your Canvas fit in the window.
8.	 Double-click on the line once you are close to the first point and the end point. Two 
more points are added. Click on one of the newly created points and notice handles 
appear that will allow you to make a curved shape path. Drag the handles on each of 
the new points to make your own curved path. Click on any point and drag it across the 
line to change its position. Option + click a handle on any point to break them apart and 
customize you shape even more. Use the following screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors

9.	 As a final step, change the value of Path Shape to Rectangle. Choose a few more 
path shapes to familiarize yourself with the options available to you. Customize the 
additional settings as you see fit.
There's more...
There's a lot of flexibility in Motion's behaviors to use custom shapes to create animation.
Using Geometry under Path Shapes
If you choose Geometry under Path Shape in the Motion Path behavior, you are asked to give 
it a source to use for your object to travel along. In Library under Shapes, there are 16 shapes 
you can use as the source as indicated in the following screenshot. Simply apply them to your 
project and then drag the shape in the source well for the path shape.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
89
The Snap Alignment to Motion behavior
The Snap Alignment to Motion behavior is a great complement to Motion Path. Sometimes 
when you have objects following along a path, you want it to turn with the path. Take a look 
at the following screenshot. I added a text layer and used one of the characters from the 
Webdings font. I adjusted the path to make it curved and then applied the Snap Alignment  
to Motion behavior from Basic Motion.

2.	 With the AquaBall selected, go to the gear icon and choose Throw from under Basic 
Motion as shown in the following screenshot. Press the F7 key to reveal the HUD.
3.	 Press the Space bar to play back the project. Nothing happens. In the HUD, we  
need to determine where we want the ball to go. Click and drag the center cross hair 
to the right-hand side until you see an arrow. Drag it till it touches the outermost edge 
of the circle. If the circle isn't moving fast enough to go offscreen, drag the zoom 
parameter to the right and than drag the arrow further to the right as shown in the 
following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
91
4.	 Stop the playback. Make sure you're on the first frame of your project. Decrease 
the Canvas size by pressing the Command + - shortcut. Select AquaBall in the 
Canvas and drag it until it's offscreen to the left-hand side. The ball now travels from 
offscreen left to offscreen right. If it's not, select the Throw behavior and try adjusting 
the zoom value in the HUD followed by the arrow.
5.	 Click on the i icon to go to the Inspector. Click on the disclosure triangle next to 
Throw Velocity. Adjust the x value to 250. Press the Space bar to play back.
6.	 Let's reset the Throw behavior and throw the ball so it looks like it's falling away from 
us. Click the hooked arrow on the top-right corner of the Behaviors tab as shown in 
the following screenshot. Click on the Properties tab and set Position to 0,0 and 
Scale to 400.
www.it-ebooks.info

7.	
In the HUD, change the 2D tab to 3D. Click and drag in the center to get an arrow. 
Drag the arrow so that it faces away from you, as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 In the Inspector, change the value of Throw Velocity of z to -3000. Play back your 
project. The ball is now thrown back in space. With the ball selected, in the Layers 
tab, go to the gear icon and choose Spin from Basic Motion. Press the F2 key to 
go to the Behaviors tab. Under Spin, change the Axis to y and set the Spin Rate 
to 9 degrees. Finally, adjust the middle circle in the HUD display as you see fit. Pay 
attention to the changes that take place in the Behaviors tab, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

There's more...
The Throw behavior is a great introduction to the complex and never-ending world of 3D  
in Motion!
Z space and 3D
Through our simple change on Throw Velocity, we have started with the most basic 
introductions to the world of 3D. While x is left and right and y is up and down, z denotes 
depth. The further back an item is, the smaller the number it will be on z. That's why when  
we threw our ball -3000 pixels back it became really small.

Adding an Attractor and Attracted To 
behavior
Goodbye Basic Motion and hello Simulations! While Basic Motion behaviors are some  
of the most commonly used animation tools, we may also want to simulate real-life  
movement even further. That's where simulation behaviors come in. Gravity, Wind,  
Edge Collisions, and more are here to help give your projects that extra magic touch.
How to do it...
1.	 Double-click to open the 03_04_Attractor project.
2.	 This project consists of one large arrow and six small ones. Press the Space bar to 
play back the project. You'll see that the large arrow moves from the top-left corner  
of the screen to the bottom-right corner. Stop and move back to the first frame of  
the project.
3.	 Select the Small Arrows group and press the Command + - shortcut to zoom out on 
the Canvas to around 20 percent. You should be able to see the bounding box for the 
group as shown in the following screenshot, but by default, you can't see any of your 
objects offscreen:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
95
4.	 Navigate to View | Show Full View Area. You should now be able to see those 
missing arrows as seen in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
96
5.	 We want these small arrows to follow along with the big one. We're going to apply an 
Attractor behavior to the big arrow. Select the BIG ARROW group. Go to the gear icon 
just under the Canvas and choose Attractor under Simulations.
6.	 Play back the project again. Only two arrows seem to move; the arrow inside the 
BIG ARROW group and the small arrow in front of it. Stop the playback. Select the 
Attractor behavior and press the F2 key to go the Behaviors tab. Increase the 
Strength to 100 and Influence to 2000. Now the small arrows follow the big arrow, 
but the entire animation is springing back and forth.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
97
7.	
If you look closely in the Canvas with the Attractor behavior selected, you can see 
that the path the group travels along is still the same. Since we've added the behavior 
to the group and not the YELLOW ARROW layer, it's also influenced by the behavior. 
In the Layers tab, drag the behavior from the group to the YELLOW ARROW layer.
8.	 Start the playback. Now the small arrows have stopped moving. In the Behaviors 
tab, change the the value of Affect from Related Objects to All Objects. The yellow 
arrow attracts the smaller ones as shown in the following screenshot. Adjust the other 
settings to get a feel for the parameters. When finished, navigate to File | Open and 
open the 04_04_Attracted_to project from the exercise folder for this chapter.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
98
9.	 Press the Space bar to play the project. This project contains six ants; five small 
ones and a big one that has been animated using a Motion Path and the Snap 
Alignment to Motion behavior. We want the small ants to start offscreen and start 
following the big one at 1 second and 15 frames until the end of the project. Let's 
add an Attracted To behavior to the small ants to simulate this motion. First, stop 
the playback and drag the ANT CHILDREN group offscreen to the left. Hold down the 
Shift key to constrain the movement. Since the group won't start until later, let's trim 
the layers' in-point. Drag the in-point of the group in the mini-Timeline to 1 second 
and 15 frames as shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 With the ANT CHILDREN group still selected, go to the gear icon and navigate to 
Simulations | Attracted To. Press the F7 key to show the HUD.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
99
11.	 You'll see that the Object well in the HUD is set to None. We need to feed it a source. 
Drag the ANT KING group into the source well, wait for the hooked arrow and release 
your mouse. Use the following screenshot for reference. Press the Space bar to play 
back. Navigate to View | Show Full View Area if you can't see the ants offscreen. 
They're staying still.
12.	Press the Space bar to stop. Increase the Influence slider to 1500. If you're having 
trouble adjusting the value in the HUD, go to the Behaviors tab. Play back the  
project again.
13.	Increase the Strength to 60, Falloff Rate to 2, Influence to 6000, and Drag to 1. 
These parameters "push and pull" against each other, controlling how much and little 
influence the attracted object has on them.
14.	 Now the ANT CHILDREN group still doesn't turn with the motion path. Let's change 
that by adding Snap to Alignment behaviors to each one of them. Click on the 
disclosure triangle for the ANT CHILDREN group and select Ant Child 1. Go to  
the gear icon and select Snap Alignment to Motion from Basic Motion.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors

15.	 In the HUD, change the axis from Horizontal to Vertical. Select the behavior and press 
the Command + C shortcut to copy it. Select the remaining ANT CHILDREN and press 
Command + V to paste the modified behavior as shown in the following screenshot:
Simulation behaviors are very render intensive. It's best practice to stop the playback before 
trying to tweak them.
Stop the playback when tweaking Simulation behaviors
While it was easy to adjust Basic Motion behaviors and play them back in real time, simulations 
are render-intensive. It's a good habit to stop the playback and tweak your settings to avoid any 
small hiccups that Motion could encounter in trying to calculate all that data!

Adding Edge Collision and Gravity behaviors 
to a ball
Combining simulation behaviors can create some complex animation. Let's take a look at how 
we can make a ball bounce around our Canvas.
How to do it...
1.	 Double-click to open the 03_05 project.
2.	 Press the Space bar to start the playback. This project consists of a 3D ball being 
tossed across the screen using the Throw behavior. Click on the disclosure triangle 
for the group to reveal its content. You can see the behavior along with the filters 
used to colorize the object. Let's add a little gravity to the ball so that it falls down.
3.	 Go to the gear icon just under the Canvas and choose Gravity from under 
Simulations. The Throw behavior is affected by gravity and the ball now falls down.
4.	 Press the F7 key to reveal the HUD. Increase the Acceleration to a value of 100. 
Notice how the ball falls down quicker as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 Press the D key a few times to cycle to the Throw behavior in the HUD and drag the 
arrow to the right-hand side to increase the throw velocity. Since the ball is being 
thrown more aggressively, gravity has a different effect. Experiment with different 
values for the Throw Velocity and Gravity Acceleration. Press the F2 key to go to  
the Behaviors tab of the Inspector.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
102
6.	 In the Behaviors tab, change the value of Gravity Acceleration to 2000 and under 
Throw Change, the Throw Velocity on X and Y to 1000.
7.	
Select the 3D ball in the Layers tab. Go to the gear icon just under the Canvas  
and choose Edge Collision from under Simulations. Use the following screenshot  
for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
103
8.	 By default, the edges are set to the width of your project. In this case, it's 1920 by 
1080. Play back your animation by pressing the Space bar and notice that as soon  
as the ball comes close to the edge, it will bounce away from it.
9.	 In the HUD, bring down the Bounce Strength to 50 and see how the ball slowly loses 
its bounce each time it hits the edges. Bring the Bounce Value up to 100.
10.	 If the ball appears to not quite hit the edge, try increasing the height and width 
slightly. For Width, I used 2020 and for Height, 1180. Use the following screenshot  
for reference:
11.	 As a final step, select the 3D ball in the Layers tab. Go to the gear icon just under the 
Canvas and navigate to Simulations | Align to Motion (Simulations). Notice how the 
ball rotates when it moves. Decrease the Spring Tension in the HUD to 50. Try playing 
around with the other behavior settings to see the different results you can get.

Creating Random Motion using the 
Randomize behavior
Random Motion allows us to add a little variation to our projects. In fact, using Randomize 
under Parameter behaviors allows us to target a specific value. Let's see how this differs with  
a Random Motion behavior.
How to do it...
1.	 Double-click to open 03_06 from the exercise folder for this chapter.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the animation. It's three circular shapes being 
thrown across the screen. We're going to add a random simulation behavior to them. 
Stop the playback. In the Layers tab, select the Purple, Blue, and Yellow circles as 
shown in the following screenshot. Go to the gear icon just under the Canvas and 
choose Random Motion under Simulations.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
105
3.	 Play back the animation. You may notice that each of your circles has a subtle bit of 
randomization to it. To make the circles appear as if they are growing and shrinking, 
we're going to have the Random Motion behavior affect the z position. Select all 
three of the Random Motion behaviors by Command + clicking them, and then click 
on Z in the HUD to include it, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Let's change the frequency and amount on each of the circles to different values 
so we can get a sense for how they affect our objects. On the Blue circle, select 
the Random Motion behavior. Press the F2 key to go to the Behaviors tab. Set the 
Frequency to 1000 and the Amount to 200.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
106
5.	 On the Purple circle, select the Random Motion behavior. In the Behaviors tab,  
set the Frequency to 100 and the Amount to 600.
6.	 On the Yellow circle, select the Random Motion behavior. In the Behaviors tab,  
set the Frequency to 1200 and the Amount to 500. Play back the animation.
7.	
To get a closer look at what's happening with the Purple circle selected, go to the 
Properties tab by pressing the F1 key. You'll see that the Position parameter is being 
controlled by the behavior. We can see this because of the gear icon to the right-hand 
side of the parameter, as shown in the following screenshot. The values randomize 
over time. The higher the frequency, the more often it changes; the higher the 
amount, the greater it changes.
8.	 Select all three of the Random Motion behaviors and press the Delete key to remove 
them from the circles.
9.	 So far, when we've added behaviors, there's been no say over which parameters are 
affected. Simply, we add the behavior to the object and change the settings. The 
beauty of parameter behaviors is that we can target which parameter we want. Let's 
say we want to randomize the position of our circle more frequently. With the Purple 
circle still selected in the Properties tab, Ctrl + click on the word Position. Navigate to 
Add Parameter Behavior | Randomize as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
107
10.	 In the Behaviors tab, bring up the Amount to 30, change the value of Apply  
Mode to Add and Subtract and change the value of Frequency to 20,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
108
11.	 The Add and Subtract apply mode looks at your position and adds to or takes away 
from that number based on the amount you've specified. Try applying different 
random behavior parameter settings by adding the behavior to the other two  
circles' positions using the preceding method.
There's more...
Motion offers you a few ways to add parameter behaviors. Let's explore why adding them in 
the Inspector may be the most beneficial way.
Parameter behaviors are best added in the Properties tab
Parameter behaviors are the only behaviors we can add by Ctrl + clicking on the chosen 
parameter in the Properties tab. Like other behaviors, we can also add parameter behaviors 
to objects by going to the gear icon or from the Library. The problem with these two methods 
is we need to do an additional step because we haven't yet targeted a specific parameter. All 
we've targeted is the object that will be affected. When using the Library or gear icon, make 
sure to select the parameter you want to affect in the Apply To field in the Properties tab,  
as shown in the following screenshot:

Now that we've been introduced to our first parameter behavior in Chapter 2, Looking at 
Motion's Library, let's look at a few more and see what they can do.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
109
How to do it...
1.	 Open 03_06 from the exercise folder for this chapter.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the animation. It's four arrows travelling from left 
to right across the screen. We're going to add a different parameter behavior to all 
three and see the effects. Stop the playback. Move the playhead to the 5-second 
mark in the mini-Timeline. In the Layers tab, select the S layer. Press the F1 key to go 
to the Properties tab. Ctrl + click on the word Position. Navigate to Add Parameter 
Behavior | Stop. Start the playback. The arrow stops dead in its tracks at 5 seconds 
and remains there till the end of the animation.
3.	 Select the W layer. Press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab. Ctrl + click on the 
word Position and navigate to Add Parameter Behavior | Wriggle.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
110
4.	 Click on the Behaviors tab in the Inspector. Change the value of Amount to 50, the 
Apply Mode to Add and Subtract, and the Frequency to 0.5. Wriggle is very similar 
to the Randomize behavior as shown in the following screenshot. It wiggles the arrow 
on its position coordinates by adding and subtracting to its original position value. 
Play back the animation.
5.	 Select the R layer. Press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab. Ctrl + click on the 
word Position and navigate to Add Parameter Behavior | Rate.
6.	 Click on the Behaviors tab in the Inspector. Change the value of Rate to 20.  
Notice how the path the arrow travels along moves slightly quicker as well as  
projects upward. Press the Command + Z shortcut a few times until the Rate 
behavior is removed. Again, press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab.  
Ctrl + click on the letter X under Position and navigate to Add Parameter  
Behavior | Rate.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
111
7.	
Change the value of Rate to 20. Start the playback. Notice how when we only select 
X the rate only affects the speed of travel to the left and right.
8.	 In the Layers tab, select the Q layer. Press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab.  
Ctrl + click on the word Position. Navigate to Add Parameter Behavior | Quantize.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
112
9.	 Click on the Behaviors tab in the Inspector. Increase the Step Size to 100. Notice 
that the arrow seems to jump from point to point rather than follow a smooth path  
of travel.
10.	 Select the S layer and navigate to Object Menu | Solo. Continue this for each layer to 
get a sense for the animation by itself as you play back. Change the values for each 
parameter behavior to get a sense for how they work.
Wriggle is one of my favorite parameter behaviors.
There's a lot to the Wriggle behavior
The Wriggle behavior is great not only for making changes to position, but also for a whole  
lot of other parameters too. One of my favorite things to do when working in 3D is add  
a light to a scene and add a Wriggle behavior to the intensity value so the light appears to  
be flickering. Take a look in the 03_07_Bonus project in the exercise folder for this chapter.  
I added a Wriggle parameter behavior to the intensity and color values of Light.

Using the Link behavior
The Link behavior allows you to link the parameter values of one object to another. Let's take 
a look at two examples for how the link behavior can be used to aid us in our workflow.
How to do it...
1.	 Under the exercise files of this chapter, open the 03_08 project by double-clicking  
on it.
2.	 This project consists of three layers. The background map that is scaling up uses a 
Grow/Shrink behavior. The two compasses remain static in the foreground.
3.	 We want both compasses to rotate by the same values as the project plays. Select 
Compass 02 in the Layers tab and press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab.
Ctrl + click the word Rotation and navigate to Add Parameter Behavior | Link as 
shown in the following screenshot. Press the F7 key to show the HUD.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
114
4.	 The Link behavior in the Layers tab is turned off. This is because it needs a source 
to link to. Click-and-drag Compass 01 and drop it into the Source Object well in the 
HUD. Once it's added, you will see a picture of the compass in the well and the Link 
behavior will turn on, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
115
5.	 The next task is to tell the behavior which parameter to link to. Since we Ctrl + clicked 
on the word Rotation, Motion assumes that you want to link the rotation of the 
source object to the rotation of the target object (the one you added the behavior to). 
To see how they're connected, select the Compass 01 layer and click on the gear icon 
under the Canvas. Navigate to Basic Motion | Spin.
6.	 In the HUD, drag the arrow on the outer circle to about 11 o'clock as shown in the 
following screenshot:
7.	
Press the Space bar to play back the animation. Notice how both the compasses now 
rotate by the same amount. Let's say we wanted to have Compass 02 rotate the other 
way and by a slightly higher amount.
8.	 Select the Link behavior in the Layers tab and press the F2 key to go to  
the Behaviors tab. Double-click on the number next to Scale and enter -2.  
The compass now spins in the opposite direction twice as fast.
9.	 Let's look at another example where we can apply the Link behavior to text objects. 
Essentially, what we want is for one text object to scale up and the other text object 
to scale down. Save your current project by pressing the Command + S shortcut. 
Navigate to File | Open and navigate to the exercise folder of this chapter and  
choose the 03_08_Link_Scale project.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
116
10.	 Press the Space bar to play back the animation. There are two text objects in the 
Layers tab. One scales up and down over time and the other stays stagnant on the 
screen. We want the still text layer to move in the opposite direction.
11.	 While you may think Scale is the parameter to link, it's not. Let's try it anyway. 
Select the I Get Small layer and press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab of the 
Inspector. Ctrl + click the word Scale and navigate to Add Parameter Behavior | 
Link. Press the F7 key to show the HUD if it's not displayed.
12.	Click-and-drag the As I Get Big text to the Source Object well in the HUD. Release 
your mouse when you see the hooked arrow.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
117
13.	Press the i icon in the HUD to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Double-click 
on the Scale field number and type -1. For Scale, a negative number flips the object, 
as shown in the following screenshot. In order to have the I Get Small text scale in 
the opposite direction, we're going to link the Z position parameters of the two text 
objects. Think of Z as depth. A negative number is further back in the Canvas and a 
positive number is closer.
14.	 In the HUD, click on Target Parameters and navigate to Properties | Transform | 
Position | Z as shown in the following screenshot. Repeat this step for Compatible 
Parameters. Press the Space bar to play back the project. Your I Get Small text  
now scales in the opposite direction from the As I Get Big text. Set the Scale  
to -1 if needed.

An intro to Text behaviors
So far, the behaviors we've added in Motion have had no restrictions. It means we can  
apply them to any movie, still, PSD file, or Text object, and it will work. The next few behaviors 
we'll be exploring are restrictive, meaning you can only apply them to particular objects. For 
instance, particle behaviors can be applied to particles and text behaviors can only be applied 
to text. While there's an entire chapter dedicated to text, here's a sneak peak at animating text 
with behaviors.
How to do it...
1.	 From the exercise files of this chapter, open the 03_09 project by double-clicking on it.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the project. It's a simple text object with a  
lightly-animated gradient background from the Library. Let's animate this layer  
in and out using some blur behaviors.
3.	 Go to the gear icon under the Canvas and navigate to Text Basic | Blur In.
Selecting a text behavior from the behavior icon underneath the Canvas
4.	 Play back the animation. The text blurs in. With the Blur In behavior selected in the 
Layers tab, notice in the mini-Timeline that the behavior is 1 second and 10 frames 
long. Unlike the majority of behaviors we've added in previous exercises, a lot of text 
behaviors are simply meant to bring your text in and out of the screen, so they are 
much shorter in length.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
119
5.	 Let's have our text blur offscreen as well. Select the text again and click on the gear 
icon underneath the Canvas. Navigate to Text Basic | Blur Out.
6.	 Play back the animation. Notice how the text animation blurs in and then blurs out at 
the same time. By default, text behaviors start at the beginning of the text layer. All we 
need to do is move the behavior. Select the Blur Out behavior. In the mini-Timeline, 
move your playhead to the last frame of the project. Press the Shift + ] shortcut to  
move the out-point of the Blur Out behavior to where your playhead is, as shown in  
the following screenshot:
7.	
Let's add one behavior that will animate your text for the entire project length. Press 
the Command + 2 shortcut to go to the Library and navigate to Behaviors | Text 
Sequence. Double-click on the Text-Continuous folder as shown in the following 
screenshot. Drag the Quiver behavior to the text in the Layers tab. Play back the 
project. Press the F2 key to go to the Behaviors tab and change some of the values 
under the Randomize Sequence section to your liking. Play back the project again.
www.it-ebooks.info

There's more…
All the text behaviors you see in Motion come from one behavior!
It all began with Sequence Text
There are a lot of text behaviors in Motion but the funny thing is one behavior created them 
all. Under the Text Animation category, there is a behavior called Sequence Text. This 
behavior will allow you to recreate any animation from Motion's text behaviors.
You can get a good grasp of all the text behaviors by previewing them in the Library.
Don't forget the Library to preview your animations
Can you see the word for a text behavior and don't know what it does? Go to the  
Library and preview the animation in the upper-left corner by selecting it, as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Writing on your shape's outline
Motion gives you the ability to draw and erase shape outlines easily. Maybe you want to draw 
on an animated line over a map to animate the path of travel. Let's see how we can use this.
How to do it...
1.	 From the exercise files of this chapter, open the 03_10 project by double-clicking  
on it.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
121
2.	 The project consists of a simple circle and square. Let's apply a Shape behavior  
to draw these objects on the screen. Select the Rectangle layer and click on  
the gear icon under the Canvas. Navigate to Shape | Write On as shown in the  
following screenshot:
3.	 Nothing happens. That's because the Write On behavior will only work on the outline, 
not the fill of a shape. Press the F4 key to go to the Shape tab of the Inspector. Under 
the Style pane, turn off Fill and turn on Outline as shown in the following screenshot. 
Play back the animation.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Behaviors
122
4.	 The Rectangle layer is drawn onscreen over the length of the project. Stop the 
playback. Select the Write On behavior in the Layers tab and move your playhead  
to 2 seconds in the mini-Timeline. Press the O key to trim the out-point of the 
behavior. Play back the animation and notice the outline being drawn over 2 seconds.
5.	 Let's spice up the look of the outline. Select the Rectangle layer and press the F7 key 
to bring up the HUD. Click on the icon next to Shape Styles and select Frost Heavy 
from under Garnish as shown in the following screenshot. Increase the Width of the 
outline to 16.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
123
The outline is now a Frost Heavy texture as shown in the following screenshot. Your 
system may slow down if you try to play back. If it does, press the Command + R 
shortcut to create a RAM preview.
6.	 Let's add another Write On behavior to the Circle. Rather than selecting the behavior 
from the gear icon, Option + click on the existing Write On behavior from the 
Rectangle and drag it to the Circle in the Layers tab.
7.	
Select the Circle, and in the HUD, turn off Fill and turn on Outline. Increase the 
Length to 16 and the Roundness to 20. Click on the icon next to Shape Style and 
choose Frost Light from under Garnish.
8.	 Select the Write On behavior under the Circle and change the value of Shape 
Outline to Draw and Erase, the Direction to Reverse, and the Speed to Ease Both. 
Move to 5 seconds on the mini-Timeline and press the O key to trim the behavior's 
out-point. Use the following screenshot for reference:
9.	 Press the Command + R shortcut to create a RAM preview and then the Space bar to 
play back the animation. The circle draws on and erases off over a span of 5 seconds.

Final Cut Pro X allows you to make speed changes by simply clicking on a clip and going to 
the Retime menu as shown in the following screenshot. In Motion, applying speed changes 
is similar, but rather than a Retime menu, we have the Behavior menu to which we apply a 
speed behavior to the full clip or a portion of a clip.

126
How to do it...
1.	 Select the clip in the Layers tab and go to your gear icon underneath the Canvas. 
Choose Set Speed from under Retiming as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Press the F7 key to show the HUD. The clip has already been slowed down to 50%. 
100% represents the actual speed of a clip. To speed it up, set the Speed to 300%. If 
you're having trouble getting to the exact percentage, Option + click to the right or left 
of the scroll wheel to move one increment at a time. Play back your project.
3.	 Let's say that we wanted the clip to play faster at the beginning of the clip, slow down 
for a pivotal moment, then play back at normal speed. To achieve this, we're going 
to use three speed behaviors. First, trim back the out-point of your first behavior just 
before you want to slow it down by dragging it.
4.	 Option + click and drag the behavior in the Layers tab to make a copy.
5.	 Name the first behavior as Fast and the second one as Slow. Select the Fast 
behavior and move to its out-point by using the Shift + O shortcut. Select the Slow 
behavior and use the Shift + [ shortcut to move its in-point to the playhead.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
127
6.	 In the HUD, change the value of Speed to 20. Drag the out-point of the behavior to 
encompass the whole action you're trying to slow down. Increase the Ease In  
and Ease Out time to 30.
7.	
Select the Fast behavior and press Command + C to copy it and Command + V to 
paste it. Move it down in the Timeline right after the Slow behavior finishes. Select 
the Fast Copy behavior and move it to the end of the Timeline and press the O key to 
trim the out-point to the playhead. Play back your animation.

Holding and looping your animations
Sometimes you may just want a video clip to repeat itself over and over again. At other times, 
you may need to hold the end frame of a clip or an action in the middle of the clip. We can use 
the Retiming behavior to achieve these desired results.

128
How to do it...
1.	 Select the clip in the Layers tab and go to your gear icon underneath the Canvas. 
Choose Hold from under Retiming.
2.	 Play back your project. The Hold Frame behavior gets added right where your 
playhead is and lasts to the end of your project. Let's make it only 1 second.  
Select the Hold Frame behavior and use the Shift + I shortcut to move to the  
in-point of the behavior.
3.	 Press Shift + Command + A to deselect everything and press Shift + = + 1 + . to 
move your playhead 1 second forward. Select the Hold Frame behavior and press  
the O key to trim its out-point to your playhead as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Let's try to loop the video clip we have three times. First, select your Hold Frame 
behavior and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
5.	 We need to find out how long our clip is and then increase our project length to  
three times that amount. To find out the exact length of the clip, go to the Media  
tab behind the Inspector and look at the duration for your clip as shown in the 
following screenshot:
6.	 Click on the arrow in the time field underneath the Canvas and choose Show Project 
Duration. Double-click on the time field and change the project duration to fit the 
time you need. Use the following screenshot for reference:

7.	
Click on the Layers tab and select your clip. Go to the gear icon under the Canvas and 
navigate to Retiming | Loop. Select the clip. In the mini-Timeline, move the playhead 
to the end of your project and press the O key to extend the clip and the behavior for 
the full project duration.
8.	 The only thing left to decide is how often we want the animation to loop. By default, 
it's set to loop the video every 30 frames. Let's say your video is 10 seconds long and 
your project is set to 29.97 fps; we would set the value of the loop behavior to 300 
frames so it goes through the whole video. Select the Loop behavior. Press the F2 
key to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector and adjust the Loop Duration to your 
desired setting.

Introduction
Keyframing is the change of an element's attribute in space and time. In Motion, attributes 
can also be thought of as a layer's parameters. If you went through the last chapter, you'll 
realize how helpful behaviors are to the animation process, but with the option to keyframe, 
your workflow becomes even more flexible. Maybe you feel more comfortable working with 
keyframes coming from other applications, or you may want to customize your animations 
beyond the values a behavior gives you. Regardless of the reason, keyframing in Motion will 
allow you to create dynamically rich animated projects.

Making It Move with Keyframes

Moving a still's anchor point and keyframing 
its scale
FCP X and Motion both allow you to animate stills using keyframes. Let's look at how similar 
the process is between the two applications. As we dive deeper into the chapter, we'll see the 
rich features Motion has to take your animations above and beyond FCP X's capabilities when 
it comes to animation.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion and set the Preset to Broadcast 720p, Frame Rate to 29.97, and 
Duration to 10 seconds. Press Command + 1 to go to the File Browser and locate 
the Chapter 4 – Exercise folder on your computer. Open the 04_01 subfolder 
and select the photo inside it. Choose Import. The photo should be in the middle of 
the Canvas, as shown in the following:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
133
2.	 We want to zoom in on the cat's right eye slowly over time. While we can easily 
keyframe the scale and position to achieve this effect, we're going to adjust the 
anchor point of the image to determine what point we will scale into. Be default, on 
still images and video, the anchor point is located in the middle of the object. Let's 
change it by using the Anchor Point tool. In the Layers tab, click the arrow to the right 
of the selection tool to get access to the tools underneath and choose Anchor Point, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Drag the red and green arrow to position the anchor point over the cat's right eye.  
Use the following as your guide:
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
134
4.	 Press Shift + S to jump back to the selection tool. To see the effect this change 
has had on the clip, select the photo in the Layers tab and press F1 to go to the 
Properties tab of the Inspector. Scrub the scale value to see where it scales 
into. Press Command + Z to undo the change and do the same for rotation; press 
Command + Z to undo that change as well.
5.	 Let's now keyframe the scale to have the image grow over time. Before we begin, here 
are a couple of general rules of keyframing in Motion:


You need at least two keyframes at different points in time and with different 
values to have animation


Once we add a keyframe to a parameter, if we adjust that parameter's value 
at a later point in time, an additional keyframe will be added automatically
6.	 In the Properties tab, make sure you are on the first frame of the project. Hover your 
cursor just to the right of the scale number until you see a diamond pop-up. Click on 
the diamond; you'll see that it's highlighted, as shown in the following screenshot. 
This indicates that a keyframe has been added at this point in time.
7.	
Move to the end of the mini-Timeline and scale up your still 50 percent more from 
the previous value. Notice that once you adjust the value, a keyframe is automatically 
added for you, as you can see in the following screenshot of the highlighted icon:
This can also be seen in the Timeline at the bottom of the screen, as shown here:

8.	 Play back the animation and notice how the picture scales up and moves in on the 
cat's right eye.
There's more…
You can easily move between keyframes on a selected object by using Option + K to move 
to the previous keyframe and Shift + K to the next keyframe. The same can be achieved in 
the Inspector. You'll notice on keyframed parameters that you'll be able to see the diamond 
shape. To the left and the right are arrows that allow you to move back and forth between the 
keyframes, as shown in the following:
In Motion 5, we can also see all the keyframes on a layer displayed in the Timeline without 
having to go to the Keyframe Editor. On top of this, you can easily drag a keyframe to another 
point in time. When dragging, if you hold down the Shift key while approaching your playhead, 
the keyframe will snap to that position:

Deleting and disabling keyframes
When you first begin animating with keyframes, you may add one, two, or even hundreds of 
keyframes by accident! Also, you might want to toggle the animations you create on and off to 
see how your video looked before and after the animations. Let's look at a few ways we can 
achieve that.

Making It Move with Keyframes
136
How to do it...
1.	 Locate the Chapter 4 folder and navigate to the 04_02 project. Double-click on  
it to open.
2.	 Play back the project by pressing the Space bar. This is the same picture of the 
cat used in the last recipe, except keyframes have been added to Opacity and 
Rotation. At the beginning of the animation, the image fades in from black, and 
over the 10 second duration, the picture scales and rotates slightly. We can identify 
all the keyframe parameters in the Properties tab by looking for any number that is 
highlighted in red. See this for yourself by pressing F1 with the still selected, using the 
following screenshot as a guide:
3.	 Let's say we want to temporarily disable an animating parameter such as Opacity. 
Make sure your playhead is at the one second mark in the mini-Timeline. In the 
Properties tab, to the right of the diamond next to Opacity, click on the downward 
arrow (the Animation menu) and select Disable Animation (shown in the following 
screenshot). A disable parameter is identified by a dash in the Properties tab. Play 
back the animation once and see that the still no longer fades in at the beginning. 
Disabling an animation does not delete any keyframes from the parameter. To enable 
the opacity animation again, simply go back to the Animation menu and choose 
Enable Animation. Play back the animation and see that the fade-in appears again.

4.	 When you want to delete a keyframe, we've got a few options. Let's say we no longer 
want our image to rotate. In the Properties tab, make sure we are on the first rotation 
keyframe. Go to the Animation menu and choose Delete Keyframe. Move to the last 
keyframe and this time just click the diamond and notice that the keyframe disappears.
5.	 Press Command + Z a few times to bring back both keyframes on rotation. Let's say 
that we want to delete all keyframes from the Transform properties. Rather than 
having to click on every single keyframe, we can reset all the parameters. Click the 
hooked arrow at the top-right of the Transform window to reset all the values. You can 
see the reset arrow in the following screenshot. Both Scale and Rotation have been 
reset, but Opacity remains animated.
6.	 To reset Opacity, click on the hooked arrow to the right of the Blending Properties. 
Now no parameters have keyframes.
7.	
Press Command + Z a few times until all the keyframes come back.

Selecting and deleting keyframes in the Timeline
You can also select and delete keyframes in the Timeline. Simply select the keyframe under 
the layer and press Delete from your keyboard. Keep in mind that if two or more parameters 
are keyframed at the same position in time, they will all be deleted.
While a lot of keyframing can be done in the Inspector, for fine-tuned animations we go to the 
Keyframe Editor.
For more control, proceed to the Keyframe Editor
For fine control over your keyframes and individual values, we need to look beyond the 
Timeline and the Properties tab. Here comes the Keyframe Editor. We can access it from 
the Window menu, by pressing Command + 8, Ctrl + clicking a keyframe in the Timeline, or 
clicking on the keyframe icon at the bottom-right of the Timeline. In the Keyframe Editor, 
we can copy and paste keyframes, see how various keyframed parameters interact with 
one another, and get an understanding of how Motion interpolates the values between your 
keyframes. We'll see more of the Keyframe Editor in the next few recipes, but for a sneak-
peek, have a look at the following screenshot:
In the Keyframe Editor, the lines you see between keyframed parameters represent interpolation.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4

Interpowhat?!?! ……Interpolation explained
Interpolation is the path of travel between two keyframes. Basically, as an animator, you add 
keyframes and Motion interpolates the values in the middle. As we'll see, not all interpolation 
is the same. For instance, some values you keyframe, such as scale, are automatically given a 
linear interpolation, meaning the rate of speed does not change between keyframes. On other 
values such as position, the interpolation will be Bezier or have curves, so the rate of speed 
changes over time. This is to try and mimic the way things move in real life. Rarely do objects 
travel along straight, linear paths. Take your car, for instance. When you start driving at a 
green light, your car slowly makes its way up to the speed limit. When it stops, your car slows 
down before coming to a rest.
Keyframing a group
We can keyframe groups the same way we keyframe layers. The advantage of keyframing 
groups is that if we have a bunch of layers or objects that are related, we can keyframe just 
the group the layers are in rather than keyframe each layer individually. Let's take a look!
How to do it...
1.	 Open the 04_03 project in this chapter's exercises folder.
2.	 Play back the project. This project consists of a radial gradient background, some 
smiley faces, text, and animated arrows. We want to animate all the elements in 
this project on and offscreen together. Select the group and press F1 to go to the 
Properties tab of the Inspector.
3.	 Move to the one-second mark on your Timeline. Next to the word Scale, in Transform 
properties, click the diamond icon to add a keyframe, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Move to the end of the Timeline and change the Scale value to 120.  
A new keyframe is automatically added.
www.it-ebooks.info

In the following screenshot, we see a view of our window's display after the preceding 
changes have been made:
4.	 Let's have the full group rotate and scale down from offscreen. With the group still 
selected, move to the beginning of the project. Enter 2500 for Scale. A keyframe is 
added automatically. Play back the animation. The group now scales from 2500 to 
100 over one second and slams into place. We would like the group to gradually slow 
down before reaching 100.
5.	 Press Command + 8 to bring up the Keyframe Editor. Drag up in between the 
Timeline and Keyframe Editor, so you have more space. Make sure the group is 
selected. Over to the left, we can see that we've added keyframes to all the scale 
values (x, y, and z.). With your mouse, draw a square around the second keyframe,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
141
Right-click the keyframe and from the menu choose Ease In. Refer to the following 
image and notice the curve on the second keyframe. Play back the animation.  
You should see that the group scales and slows down when approaching the  
second keyframe.
6.	 Move to the one-second mark in the Timeline. Click the disclosure triangle next 
to Rotation. Add a keyframe for the rotation Y parameter in the Properties tab by 
clicking on the diamond icon to the right of the Y parameter. We're not going to 
change the value here because this is where we want it to land.
www.it-ebooks.info

142
7.	
Move to the beginning of the project and type in 45 for the Y rotation. A keyframe is 
automatically added. Draw a square around the second Y rotation keyframe in the 
editor. Right-click and choose Ease In. Play back the animation.
8.	 Let's have the group animate offscreen right. Move to the five-second mark in the 
Timeline. In the Properties tab, click on the diamond icon next to Position to add  
a keyframe.
9.	 Move to six seconds and scrub the X position value until the group is offscreen right. A 
keyframe is automatically added. I entered a value of 2250. Play back the animation. 
The following screenshot shows a selected frame at the end of the animation:
There's more...
While we can move a keyframe's position by dragging in the Timeline or the Keyframe Editor, 
we can also move keyframes by selecting them and typing in a value to move them. For 
instance, to move the second Rotation Y keyframe in this recipe, select it in the Keyframe 
Editor and type in Shift + = + 1 + ., as indicated in the following screenshot. The keyframe 
moves one second forward. To move a keyframe back, select it and type – and the number 
you want and a period to force seconds. You can also move groups of keyframes in this way.

The Keyframe Editor can become a very busy place, very quickly. You can easily hide 
keyframes by clicking on the checkmark next to a parameter in the Keyframe Editor.

Autokeyframing multiple parameters on a 
shape
Besides keyframing in the Properties tab, we can also use the Canvas by dragging objects 
and turning on the Record Keyframes feature.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the 04_04 project from this chapter's exercises folder.
2.	 Play back the project by pressing the Space bar. This project consists of a movie file 
with a spinning cube.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
144
3.	 Under the Canvas, click on the Record Keyframes button or press A. Select the cube 
in the Layers tab. Press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. You should 
see every parameter marked in red, as shown in the following screenshot, indicating 
that Record Keyframes is turned on:
4.	 At the beginning of the Timeline, drag the cube down to the left and offscreen. Press 
Command + - to zoom out of the Canvas a bit. Move to the end of the Timeline and 
drag the cube up and to the right offscreen, as displayed in the following screenshot. 
The motion path becomes visible. Unlike previous recipes, when Record Keyframes 
is turned on, we don't have to add any keyframes for animation to occur. The system 
automatically adds them for us.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
145
5.	 Click in the Canvas and type 3 + . and hit Return to move to the three-second mark 
in the Timeline. Drag the bounding box around the cube in the Canvas down a touch 
to create another keyframe. Let's also have the cube scale up and then back down 
over the length of the animation.
6.	 While still at the thee-second mark, Shift + drag one of the corner circles to scale  
the cube up to 130. You can see the Scale value appearing in the upper-left side  
of the Canvas.
7.	
Press Shift + K to move to the next keyframe. Shift + drag one of the corner circles of 
the bounding box down to 80. Now, play back the animation. The cube travels along 
the path and scales up to 130 and back down to 80. Let's see another method of 
working with Record Keyframes.
8.	 With the cube selected, press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Press 
the hooked arrow in the top-right corner to reset all the Transform values. The cube 
jumps back to its original center position in the Canvas.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
146
9.	 Double-click the Record Keyframes button to go to its properties. In here, we have 
options for keyframe thinning, as shown in the following screenshot. If we were to play 
back our project, we could record keyframes on the fly. Let's set Keyframe Thinning 
to Reduced in order to minimize the number of keyframes that will be added when 
we move the cube across the screen during playback with our mouse. Press OK to 
close the window.
10.	 We're going to animate the cube during playback. First, move the cube to the  
top-left corner of the screen. We want to move the cube in a zigzag fashion across 
the screen for the duration of the project until it reaches the bottom-right corner. 
Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of the project and Record Keyframes 
is still on. Select the cube in the Canvas. Press the Space bar to play back and start 
animating the cube for six seconds. Use the following screenshot for your reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
147
11.	 If you are unhappy with the results, press Command + Z to undo your animation. 
Start from the beginning and try again. You can also smooth out the animation by 
removing some unnecessary keyframes. Simply click on those keyframes in the 
Canvas with the cube selected and press Delete.
There's more...
Turning Record Keyframes on can be disastrous to your project if you're not aware of it. It 
also doesn't help that the A shortcut key is a shortcut for the position tool in FCP X and is 
also a shortcut to record keyframes in Motion. Be very careful of this button and look at the 
preceding recipes, so that you easily know how to delete keyframes from your project.

Working with multiple parameters in the 
Keyframe Editor
It's all fine and dandy working with keyframes in the Properties tab, but when we want to see 
keyframes in relation to one another, we need to go to the Keyframe Editor. Let's take a look 
at a few methods so that we can work with it efficiently.
How to do it...
1.	 Launch Motion. From the Project Browser, select the Decode | Decode Open 
template. Choose Open a copy in Motion.
2.	 Press Shift + Z in the Canvas to fit the project to the window. Press the Space bar 
to start playback. This project consists of a lot of text that decodes onscreen as a 
camera flies and rotates through it to reveal the final title and subtitle. We want to get 
a better understanding of how the camera moves through the text by looking at its 
keyframes in the Keyframe Editor.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
148
3.	 Press Command + 8 to bring up the Keyframe Editor and drag in between it and the 
Timeline to increase its size, as shown in the following screenshot. Select the Camera 
from the Layers tab to reveal all of its animated properties.
4.	 Click on the arrows to the right of the word Animated to choose All. It reveals every 
parameter you can keyframe. Wow, there's a lot! We'll go into more detail about this in 
the later chapters. For now, just switch back to Animated.
5.	 Move the playhead to the beginning of the Keyframe Editor and press Shift + K a few 
times to move forward keyframe by keyframe. This will give you a sense of how this 
camera was keyframed. Move all the way to the last keyframe.
6.	  Since our camera has been rotated in space, Position X now controls how close we 
are to the final text (we'll also see more of this in the upcoming chapters). Let's say 
we want to punch in on it a little. It's always a good practice to solo parameters in the 
Keyframe Editor to focus on what we're working on, so Option + click the checkmark 
next to Transform.Position.X to turn off the visibility of all the other animated 
parameters in the editor. Change the value on the last keyframe to 32000 to punch in 
on the text a bit more, as shown in the following screenshot. Play back the animation 
to see the change. Option + click the checkmark next to Transform.Position.X to turn 
on visibility for all the other keyframed values.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
149
7.	
Option + click on Transform.Rotation.Y to solo it. Press Option + K several times to 
move backwards over the keyframes until you land on the third Rotation Y keyframe 
from the beginning, as seen in the following screenshot. With your mouse, scrub 
the number value back and forth to get a sense of how you can change the rotation. 
Adjust this value to 16. Option + click the checkmark next to Transform.Rotation.Y to  
see all the other animated values. Now, play back the animation.
8.	 Click the arrows to the right of the word Animated and choose Position. Navigate 
through the keyframes using Shift + K and Option + K, and adjust the values to  
your own liking.
There's more...
Sometimes your keyframes may appear too close together and may not spread out over the 
entire length of the window. To easily get our animation curves to stretch to the length of a 
window, simply click the button (shown in the following screenshot) in the top-right corner of 
the window. The visible curves will now fit to its length.

Moving keyframes in the Keyframe Editor
As animators, we will constantly be adjusting and moving keyframes in order to fine-tune our 
animations. Let's look at some ways of doing this in the Keyframe Editor.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the 04_06 project from this chapter's exercises folder.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the animation. This animation has a camera that 
goes across a series of vines that sprout onscreen, eventually revealing text. We want 
to extend the animation so it takes a second longer before coming to a rest.
3.	 Select Camera in the Layers tab and click the disclosure triangle to reveal its content, 
and notice that it's being controlled by a behavior. If we want to extend the animation, 
we simply extend the behavior.
4.	 Select the Ramp Position X behavior and press Shift + O to move to its out-point.
5.	 Double-click in the Current Time field and type Shift + = + 1 + . to move one second 
forward, as shown in the following screenshot. Press O to extend the behavior to  
this point.
6.	 Play back the animation. You may notice that everything looks great, apart from the 
fact that now the text wipes onscreen too early. Click the disclosure triangle, next to 
the Text Elements group in the Layers tab, to reveal its content. Select the Rectangle 
(for mask) layer and press Command + 8 to open the Keyframe Editor, as shown in 
the following screenshot. This mask is being used to animate the text onscreen. Let's 
move its keyframes to start one second later.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
151
7.	
Draw a box around the keyframes to select them all, and type Shift + = + 1 + . and 
hit Return to move the keyframes to start a second later. Play back the animation to 
see that the text now "pops" onscreen instead of wiping on behind the vine. This is 
a case where the rectangle mask finishes earlier than the keyframes. Move to the 
last keyframe on the mask and drag the out-point of the mask in the mini-Timeline to 
make sure it lasts until the animation is finished.
8.	 Play back the animation and notice how the vine now wipes onscreen one second 
later as intended. Let's see another example of copying and pasting keyframes. From 
the File menu, choose Open and navigate to the 04_06_02 project. Click Open.
9.	 Play back the animation. The project consists of an atom that rotates forward over the 
first second and rotates backward over the next. We want this rotation to repeat for 
the entire project.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
152
10.	 Select Atom 1 in the Layers tab and press Command + 8 to bring up the  
Keyframe Editor.
11.	 The only parameter with keyframes is Rotation, so click and draw a bounding box 
around the last two keyframes. Press Command + C to copy them.
12.	Move to the three-second mark and press Command + V to paste them.
13.	Repeat this step one more time. Copy the second and the third keyframe, and go to 
the five-second mark to paste the animation. Play back the project. Compare your 
results to the following screenshot:
How it works
As we've seen in this recipe, we can easily copy and paste keyframes to different places in 
time. Perhaps you would like to have a longer fade-in, for an animation to end on a beat of 
music, or you'd like your objects to scale up quicker over time. Moving keyframes will change 
the speed and flow of our layer's animation. If you went through the recipes in Chapter 3, 
Making It Move with Behaviors, think of changing the distance between keyframes, such as 
trimming or extending the length of a behavior.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
153
There's more...
While we copied and pasted keyframes in this recipe, there's nothing stopping you from 
dragging a keyframe in the editor. Just note, when dragging keyframes, that you can easily 
change the values if you drag up or down. As a tip, hold down the Shift key as you drag to 
constrain movement to the direction you're going. Alternatively, use the Timeline to drag and 
this will ensure that apart from the position, no other keyframe values change.

Reversing keyframes
Every once in a while, we may look at an animation and say: "That would look so much better 
if it was played in the opposite direction". That's where reversing keyframes comes in. We can 
select a series of keyframes and easily reverse them to flip the animation.
How to do it...
1.	 Open 04_07 from this chapter's exercises folder.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the animation. It's a book from Motion's Content 
library. The Opacity, Position, Scale, and Rotation parameters have been keyframed. 
We're going to reverse the Rotation and Scale keyframes, so that it animates in the 
opposite direction.
3.	 Press Command + 8 to bring up the Keyframe Editor. On the left-hand side of this 
editor, click on the word Animated and choose Rotation from the drop-down menu. 
Now, only the Rotation keyframes show in the graph.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
154
4.	 Press Command + A to select both the Rotation keyframes in the editor. Ctrl + click 
on one of the keyframes and choose Reverse Keyframes, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Play back the animation and see that it now rotates in reverse. Let's 
repeat this for Scale.
5.	 Click on the word Rotation and select Choose from the resulting drop-down list. Press 
Command + A to select all the visible keyframes. Ctrl + click on any one keyframe and 
from the list choose Reverse Keyframes. Press Command + A to select the Scale 
keyframes again. Ctrl +click any one of the keyframe and choose Ease Both.
6.	 Play back the animation and see how the graph has curves as we leave and come 
into each of the keyframes, as shown in the following screenshot. As a final step, 
we're going to copy and paste the two Opacity keyframes to the end of the animation, 
and then reverse them so they fade in instead of out.
7.	
Click on the word Scale in the Keyframe Editor and from the resulting drop-down  
list, choose Opacity. Drag a rectangular marquee around the Opacity keyframes  
and press Command + C to copy them to the pasteboard.
8.	 Move to the five-second mark and press Command + V to paste them. Select the two 
keyframes you just pasted by dragging around them.

So far, the majority of keyframes we've changed or added have been in the Properties tab. 
We can also keyframe filters and use them to create transitional effects. We can achieve this 
by changing the Mix value from 100 to 0 or vice-versa. Try adding a Glow filter and play with 
the Mix value to add a transitional type effect. Reverse the keyframes using the steps just 
explained in this recipe.

Understanding and changing the 
interpolation
The way your objects travel from one keyframe to another can vary depending on the 
interpolation set between the two images. The default interpolation varies depending on the 
parameter you have selected. In most situations, this would either be set to Bezier or Linear. 
Let's look at some of the ways we can change the path of travel using different types of 
interpolation that are available to us in the Keyframe Editor.
www.it-ebooks.info

How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 04_08 project.
2.	 This project consists of a Butterfly.mov file, which is too short for our project. 
Luckily, we may be able to try and loop the animation to prepare the file for 
keyframing. With the Butterfly.mov file selected in the Layers tab, press F1  
to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector.
3.	 At the very bottom of the Properties tab is the Timing pane. With your mouse, hover 
over to the right of the word Timing and click on the word Show to reveal the content 
of the pane. Use the following screenshot for your reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
157
4.	 Set End Condition to Loop. We need to tell Motion how long we want the end 
duration to be. Move to the end of the mini-Timeline and with the Butterfly file still 
selected, Press O to extend it. Notice that in the Properties tab, the end duration was 
set to 280 frames.
5.	 Move to the beginning of the project with your playhead. In the Properties tab, click 
the diamond icon to the right of the word Position to add a keyframe. Go to the end 
of the project and in the X value, type 470 to reposition the Butterfly file. A keyframe 
is automatically added, as shown here:
6.	 Press Command + 8 to open the Keyframe Editor. Drag up in between the Keyframe 
Editor and the Timeline to create more space. Option + click the check mark for 
Position Y to solo it.
7.	
Click on the Fit Visible Curves in Window icon (it looks like a graph). Click the first 
keyframe in the editor and notice that a handle appears just to the right. This is 
known as a Bezier interpolation. The great thing about Bezier is we can manipulate 
the path our object goes along any way we see fit. Drag the path handle for this 
keyframe slightly down to create a curve in it.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
158
8.	 Select the second keyframe and drag its handle slightly up. Notice how the Butterfly 
animation slowly comes out of the first keyframe before getting to full speed and 
slowly comes to a stop at the last keyframe, as seen in the following screenshot:
9.	 Select both keyframes in the editor by clicking and dragging a marquee around them. 
Ctrl + click either one and choose Interpolation | Continuous, as shown. Notice how 
both the curves look very similar. Click on one of the keyframes and notice that there 
are no handles to manipulate with continuous interpolation.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
159
10.	 Let's look at a few more types of interpolation. Move to the three-second mark. 
Click the hollow diamond next to Position X in the editor to add a keyframe. Press 
Command + A to select all the visible keyframes. Ctrl +click any keyframe and choose 
Interpolation | Constant. Your graph should look similar to the one shown in the 
following screenshot. Play back the animation. Notice how the Butterfly animation 
stays in place until the next keyframe and then jumps to the next position.
11.	 Ctrl + click the first keyframe and choose Interpolation | Exponential. Play back the 
animation. Ctrl + click the first keyframe again and choose Interpolation | Logarithmic.

Converting behaviors into keyframes
Sometimes we may want a little more control from our behaviors beyond the listed parameters 
that we can tweak. The great thing is we can convert behaviors into keyframes for more 
manual control any time we want.
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 04_09 project.
2.	 Press the Space bar to play back the project. It's a ball that has been animated to 
fade in, grow, and jump from side to side.
www.it-ebooks.info

3.	 Select the ball and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Notice how 
a gear icon appears next to every property that's being controlled by behaviors. In this 
case, it's Scale, Opacity, and Position, as indicated in the following screenshot:
4.	 We want to have the ball ease in and out when it jumps from point to point, and there 
doesn't appear to be an option to switch this in the Behaviors parameters. Stop 
playback and with the AquaBall selected, choose Object | Convert To Keyframes.
5.	 Press Command + 8 to bring up the Keyframe Editor. Scroll up the window so that 
you can see the graphs clearly, as shown here:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
161
6.	 There may be more keyframes created than you had intended. If there are too many, 
simply select the unwanted keyframes and press Delete. You can also right-click a 
keyframe and choose Delete from the menu, as shown:
7.	
Option + click the checkmark next to Position X to solo it. Try to remove as many 
keyframes around the peaks that we don't need. The next screenshot shows  
quite a few that you might not want. Try marquee-selecting multiple keyframes  
to help you save some time. Make sure not to select the peaks.
8.	 Shift + click each of the keyframes at the peak of the graph to select them. Right-click 
any one of them and choose Ease Both. Look to see how the graph changes. Play back 
the animation. Repeat the preceding two steps for the lower ends of the graph.
9.	 Option + click the Position X parameter in the Keyframe Editor to unsolo it. Turn off 
Position and Opacity by clicking the checkbox, so only Scale X and Scale Y can be 
seen. Let's say we want the ball to scale up a bit, hold its value for a second, and then 
increase to its final value.
10.	 Make sure both Scale X and Scale Y are selected. Draw a square around one of the 
middle keyframes and press Command + C to copy it.

11.	 Move one second forward from the keyframe you just selected and press  
Command + V. Draw a box around the previous keyframe and Ctrl + click. Choose 
Interpolation | Linear as shown in the following screenshot. Play back the project.

Combining keyframes and behaviors – 
animating a Photoshop file
Okay, we've gone through the recipes of keyframing and also behaviors in the last chapter, 
so now it's time to bring it all together. We're going to animate a Photoshop file using both 
keyframes and behaviors to create a simple animation on screen. Let's get started!
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercise files, open the 04_10 project.
2.	 The project consists of a Photoshop file that was imported with multiple layers. Our 
goal is to animate the little ninja you see in the following image and have him jump 
onscreen while bobbling his head. We'll then have a spear fall into his hands as he 
adjusts them to fighting position. Eventually, we'll want both the spear and ninja to 
end up where the ninja currently is.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
163
3.	 Move to the one-second mark on the Timeline. Select the Ninja group. Press F1 to go 
to the Properties tab of the Inspector and add a keyframe by clicking on the diamond 
next to Position and Rotation, as shown here:
4.	 Move back to the beginning of your Timeline by pressing the home key on the 
extended keyboard or drag your playhead. Change the Position value of X: to 440  
and of Y: to 740 and the Rotation value to 720. Play back the animation. Our ninja 
rotates and jumps onscreen. Awesome!
5.	 Let's have him land a bit more softly on the ground. Press Command + 8 to open up 
the Keyframe Editor. Draw a square around the keyframes at one second to select 
them. Ctrl + click anyone of them and choose Ease In from the menu.
6.	 With the Ninja group still selected, move to the end of the Timeline. Set the X position 
value to -450. The ninja lands and then slowly moves to the left. Let's make his head 
move a bit with a Parameter behavior.
7.	
Select the Head group. Click the disclosure triangle next to Rotation in the Inspector. 
Ctrl + click Rotation Z and choose Add Parameter Behavior | Wriggle.
8.	 In the Behaviors tab, set the number to 1, Apply Mode to Add, and Subtract and the 
Frequency to 1.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
164
9.	 Jump to the two-second mark in the Timeline. Select the Spear layer. Press F1 
to jump to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Add a keyframe for Position and 
Rotation by clicking the diamonds next to the values.
10.	 Move to the two-second and the thirty-frame mark. Twirl down the Rotation  
values and type 360 in Z rotation. Change the Position values to of X: to 16  
and of Y: to 134. Play back the animation.
11.	 Move to the three-second mark. We're going to keyframe the movement of the left 
arm and attach the right arm to move with it using a Link behavior. Select Right Arm 
in the Layers tab. In the Properties tab, add a keyframe to Z Rotation. Move to four 
seconds and change Z Rotation to 30.
12.	Select Left Arm. Ctrl + click the letter Z under Rotation and choose Add Parameter 
Behavior | Link.
13.	In the Layers tab, select Right Arm and drag it to the source well on the Link 
behavior in the Behaviors tab. Refer to the Properties tab in the following image for 
reference. Play back the animation and notice how both arms move together:
14.	 Select the Spear layer. Move to three seconds in the Timeline and add a keyframe for 
Z Rotation and X Position.
15.	Move to four seconds and change the X Position to 20 and Z Rotation to 372. Play 
back the animation.

16.	 As a final step, select the Eye layer. Ctrl + click the word Scale in the Inspector and 
choose Add Parameter Behavior | Wriggle. In the Behaviors tab, set the number  
to 5, Apply Mode to Add, and Subtract and the Frequency parameters to 1.
There's more...
In order for the arms to rotate around the Ninja's shoulders, the anchor points on the arms 
were moved. This was achieved using the same method we used to move in on the cat's eye  
in the first recipe of this chapter. We'll see more about this in the next recipe.

Combining keyframes and behaviors – 
animating a clock
Let's take a look at another example of combining keyframes and behaviors by animating a 
clock's minute and hour hand while linking some text to rotate along with the clock.
How to do it...
1.	 From this chapter's exercises folder, open the 04_11 project. This project consists of 
a clock from Motion's library that contains separate layers for the hour and minute 
hand. There are also two text layers, as shown in the following image. We want the 
text to rotate along with the clock's hand. In order to achieve this, we're going to move 
both of the texts' anchor points to the center of the clock.
www.it-ebooks.info

Making It Move with Keyframes
166
2.	 On the toolbar, click and select the Anchor Point tool located underneath the 
selection tool, as shown in the following screenshot. Select the Hour Text layer and 
use the green and red arrows to move the anchor point to the center of the clock. 
Repeat this step for the other text layer.
3.	 Press Shift + S to go back to the selection tool. Let's keyframe the minute hand so 
that it rotates twice around the clock. Select the Minute Hand layer and press F1 to 
go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Make sure the playhead is at the beginning 
of the mini-Timeline. Click the disclosure triangle for Rotation and add a keyframe for 
Z Rotation.
4.	 Move to three seconds and change the Z Rotation value to -1080. Press  
Command + 8 to open the Keyframe Editor. Ctrl + click the last Z Rotation  
keyframe and choose Ease In.
5.	 Let's say we're not sure if we want the clock to rotate around three times. We want 
to keep options available in case we change our mind without having to go and redo 
every animation. Say hello to the Link behavior. The Link behavior will allow us to link 
the Z Rotation for all of our objects. If we change the keyframes on the hour hand, it 
will pass on to the linked layers. Let's link the hour hand first. Select the Hour Hand 
layer. In the Properties tab, Ctrl + click Z Rotation and choose Add Parameter | 
Link, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4
167
6.	 Press F7 to show the HUD. Drag the Minute Arm layer straight into the source well. 
Move the playhead to the beginning of the mini-Timeline and play back the animation. 
The hands are linked but they're moving at the same rate. In order to correct this, 
we're going to play with the Link behavior's Scale value.
7.	
In the Behaviors tab, change the value of Scale to 0.083. To come up with this 
number, we divide 1 by 12 (representing the number of hours on the clock). Scrub 
the animation and see the clock hands move as they're supposed to.
8.	 Select the Hour Text layer. Press F1. In the Properties tab, Ctrl + click Z Rotation and 
choose Add Parameter | Link. In the HUD, drag the Hour Arm layer straight into the 
source well.
9.	 Select the Minute Text layer. Press F1. In the Properties tab, Ctrl + click Z Rotation 
and choose Add Parameter | Link. In the HUD, drag the Minute Arm layer straight 
into the source well.
10.	 Let's see it all come together. Select Minute Arm. In the Keyframe Editor, select  
the last Z Rotation keyframe and press Command + X to cut it. Move to six seconds 
and press Command + V to paste it. On the left-hand side of the Keyframe Editor, 
double-click the Z Rotation value and set it to -2160, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Play back the animation.

Introduction
Today, in a world of increased communication through video, text plays a vital and important 
part. As technology has advanced, the need and desire to create more sophisticated and 
organic flowing text has increased tenfold. For example, when you turn on the TV tonight, pay 
attention to some of the commercials and how text behaves in them. Text is used as a way to 
communicate key messages to our audience whether it be as simple as a lower third or as 
elaborate as a kinetic text animation.
Whatever your text desire may be, Motion has an intricate set of parameters to make all of 
your text dreams come true. Its workflow not only allows us to create but also save our favorite 
designs. On top of this, Motion's elaborate set of behaviors dedicated to text allow us to have 
instant animation.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
170
This chapter will give us a basic overview of how to format and make stylistic changes to our 
text. We will also look at built-in animators and text generators available right in Motion's 
library. Let's dive right in!
Changing the text format
The Format pane of text has several options available to us before we even begin to explore 
the style and layout options of our text. Let's explore some of these features.
Getting ready
Launch Motion and choose a Broadcast 720p, 29.97 project with a 10 second duration. 
Press Shift + Z to fit the Canvas window.
How to do it...
Let's create some text and head to the Inspector to change its format.
1.	 Press T or select the T icon on the toolbar to select the text tool as shown in the 
following screenshot. Click somewhere close to the center of the Canvas. Type 
Playing With Text and press Esc to exit the text entry mode. Use the dynamic 
guides to help you center your text on the screen. Press F7 to show the HUD.
2.	 While we could switch our text in the Format pane, it's actually beneficial to do it 
in the HUD. Click and hold down the font menu (just above the alignment options). 
Scroll through the various options as shown in the following screenshot and notice 
how your text updates immediately in the Canvas. Select Al Bayan and press F4 to  
go to the Text tab of the Inspector. In the first tab we see the Format pane.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
171
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
172
3.	 At the very top of the Inspector is an option to change the style of our text with a 
preset. Click on the word Normal at the top of the Format pane and choose Gold 
Leaf as shown in the following screenshot. You'll notice the word gets filled in with a 
gradient. Style presets are a combination of parameters from all the text panes that 
we'll look at in greater detail in later exercises.
4.	 Change the value of Text Alignment to Center and Tracking to 5. Reposition the text 
in the center of the Canvas. Add a keyframe next to tracking on the first frame of the  
project by clicking the diamond shape, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 Move forward to 3 seconds and change the Tracking value to -2. An additional 
keyframe is added automatically. Move to the first frame of the project and play  
back the animation.
6.	 In the Advanced Formatting section, scrub both the slant and rotation values. Notice 
that when you scrub rotation, each of the individual characters are affected, unlike 
the Properties tab where rotation would affect the entire word.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
173
7.	
We can also change the text position by playing with Offset in the Advanced 
Formatting section. At the 4 second mark, add a keyframe by clicking on the 
diamond shape next to Offset.
8.	 Go to 6 seconds and scrub the X value to the right until the text is offscreen. Move to 
the beginning and play back the animation.
There's more…
Keyframes allow us to use animation, but don't forget about behaviors.
Text behaviors
While we created some subtle animation using keyframes, don't overlook text behaviors. They 
create animation for your text without having to use keyframes. There are hundreds of them 
and you can preview them at any point by going to the Library.
Text presets allow for quick and sophisticated design.
Saving text presets
While we had a glimpse of some of the text presets available, keep in mind you can also save 
your own for later use. This will come in handy for your projects where you need to create 
consistent stylized text.
It's important to make sure the audience can see your text.

Safe zones
Not all TV screens are made alike. This is why we have safe zones. You can turn on  
Motion's safe zones by going to the View menu above the Canvas. The innermost  
rectangle refers to the text safe margin. This will ensure that your text will appear  
on majority of the television screens.

Changing the text style
After you initially format your text, it's time to look at the stylizing options available. Motion has 
a Style pane with four sections to help you get your desired color and look finalized.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
175
Getting ready
Locate the exercise folder for this chapter and navigate to the 05_02 project. Double-click on 
it to open it.
How to do it...
Like text format, to change the text style, we head to the Inspector:
1.	 Press F4 to go to the Text tab and click on the Style pane. While we have access 
to changing the face color in the HUD, we don't have options to change the fill type. 
Change the value of Fill from Color to Gradient as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click on the disclosure triangle next to Gradient. From the gradient preset styles 
choose Dawn. Click on the blue color stop to load it in the color well. Switch the color 
to a more vibrant blue. Drag the middle color stop over to the right to increase the 
blue influence over the letters. Use the following screenshot for reference:
3.	 Now that we have made these adjustments, we could save it as a preset for later use. 
From the preset menu choose Save Preset and type in Dawn (alternate).
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
176
4.	 The great thing about Motion's Style pane is its flexibility to mix several parts of our 
text together or work with them separately. For now, turn off the face of our text by 
clicking on the blue square. Click on the empty square next to the word Outline to 
activate it. Change the value of the Color from white to black and the Width to 2.
5.	 Turn back on the face of our text. Make sure the outline is set to be Under the face.
6.	 Let's add a glow to all of our text, but rather than use the Style pane option we're 
going to use a filter. From the filter icon choose glow – glow.
7.	
Press F3 to go to the Filters tab and increase the Glow to 50.
8.	 As a final step, activate Drop Shadow by clicking on the empty square. Change 
the value of Distance to 10 and Blur to 7 as shown in the following screenshot. 
Deactivate Face and Outline to see how the drop shadow looks by itself.
9.	 Under Drop Shadow, click on the disclosure triangle next to Four Corner and change 
the bottom left X position to 15. See how you can change the other corners by playing 
with the values.
There's more...
We can also achieve this effect by adding a texture to our text.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
177
Adding textures
We can add any texture to the Face and Outline of our text. A texture can be a still image or 
even a movie file. All we need to do is make sure we have the texture we want to use in the 
Layers tab. With it, select the texture from the appropriate section and drop the texture into 
the source well. As a final step, turn off the texture in the Layers tab.
Changing the render quality for better playback
You may have noticed the quality of the video was not as sharp as the other projects. This is 
because the render quality has been turned down for better playback. At anytime, you can go 
to the render menu and choose a different resolution and quality to have a faster playback. 
Keep this in mind for render-intensive projects. Since you're reading this book, it's going to 
happen sooner rather than later.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
178
Setting the play range to a smaller value than your project length can make all the difference.
Changing the play range
Rather than playing your whole project, sometimes it's better to isolate a section we're working 
on so that Motion doesn't have to play back the entire animation. Simply drag the play range 
handles to your desired location. Use the following screenshot for reference. Press the Space 
bar and notice your project will only play between your two designated points.
Loading your project to RAM may be necessary in order to ensure you are seeing an  
accurate preview.
When you need to see it in real time, use your RAM
In the last exercise, our projects didn't play back in real time. In order to do that, we need to 
go to the Mark menu and choose an option under RAM Preview, as shown in the following 
screenshot. This will use our computer's memory to create temporary files in order to play 
back our full project or play our range in real time. Just note, as soon as you make a change, 
RAM Preview will be lost!

Changing the layout and creating text on a 
path
Sometimes we want text to follow along a path for a variety of different reasons. We may want 
text to travel across the edges of a shape or wrap to the pages of a book whose perspective  
is not flat to the screen. Whatever the reason may be, playing with text on a path in Motion  
is fun.
Getting ready
Open the 05_04 project in your Chapter 5 folder. This project consists of a sketch book from 
Motion's library.
How to do it...
We're going to create some text and try to have it match our book's perspective.
1.	 Press T to select the Text tool and on the left side of the book type Chapter 5 – 
Let's Make Text. Press the Esc key to exit the text entry mode and press F7 to 
show the HUD. Change the value of Font to Tahoma, make it Bold and set the size 
to 31. Choose a dark blue color of your liking by keeping Ctrl pressed and clicking on 
the color well. Center align the text and move it back over the book. Use the following 
screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
180
2.	 We're going to change the perspective of our text to make it seem like it's in the book. 
Make sure the text is selected in the Layers tab. Press F1 to go to the Properties tab 
of the Inspector. Click on the disclosure triangle next to Rotation. Change the value 
of X to -30.
3.	 Press F4 to go to the Text tab of the Inspector and click on the Layout pane. 
Under Layout Controls change Layout Method to Path, as shown in the following 
screenshot. At the very bottom of the Layout pane are the path options. We can have 
the text go a long a circle, rectangle, or even feed it our own custom shape. For now 
we're going to leave the default as Open Spline.
4.	 In order to adjust the path, double-click on the text in the Canvas. Move the control 
points that appear and wrap the text to the book.
5.	 Play with the offset value to center the text on the left side of the book. Notice we can 
easily keyframe this to animate our text along the path.
6.	 Let's try a different path shape. Change value of Path from Open Spline to Closed 
Spline. Click on the empty square to add a checkmark next to Inside Path. Drag the 
text back on the left side of the book. Use the following screenshot for reference:

Adding and trimming multiple text behaviors
Let's explore some of the behaviors Motion has to offer us for the text.
Getting Ready
Open the 5_05 project from the exercise folder for this chapter. Play back the project. It consists 
of a background and three pieces of text that come on screen one second after each other.
How to do it...
We're going to start by having our text come from different directions offscreen to onscreen.
1.	 Click on the disclosure triangle to open the Text group in the Layers tab. Select the 
Ready text and press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Navigate to Behaviors | 
Text Sequence | Text Basic. Select the Slide In behavior and click on Apply.
2.	 Move to 1 second on the mini-Timeline. Press Command + Option + O to trim the  
out-point of the play range. Play back the animation. Press Command + - twice to zoom 
out on the Canvas. Click and drag the red arrow until it's offscreen left as shown in the 
following screenshot. Press F2 to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector.
3.	 Click the disclosure triangle for controls, and under unit size change it from 
Characters to Word.
4.	 Option + click the Slide In behavior in the Layers tab and drag it to the Set text.  
Double-click on the Slide In behavior on the Ready text layer and rename it Slide 
in from left. Double-click on the Slide In behavior on the set text layer and 
rename it Slide in from right.
5.	 Select the Slide in from right behavior. Drag the red arrow right across the screen till 
it's no longer visible.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
182
6.	 Option + click on the Slide In from left behavior from the Ready text layer and drag it 
to the Go text. Move to 3 seconds on the mini-Timeline. Press Command + Option + O 
to trim the play range to the playhead. Play back the animation so far.
7.	
Let's finalize our animation by having each of our text behaviors dolly out of the 
screen. Select the Ready text. Select the gear icon underneath the Canvas and 
choose Text Energetic | Dolly Out as shown in the following screenshot. Move to 5 
seconds. Select the Dolly Out behavior in the Layers tab and press Shift + ] to move 
its out-point to 5 seconds. Press F2 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. 
Under the Dolly Out behavior, click on the disclosure triangle for controls and under 
Unit Size change it from Characters to Word.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
183
8.	 Option + click and drag the Dolly Out behavior to the Set text and repeat the step for 
the Go text.
9.	 Move to 5 seconds and 25 frames. Select the Dolly Out behavior on the Set text and 
press Shift + ] to move the behavior's out-point to this location. Move to 6 seconds 
and repeat the earlier step for the Go text. Press Option + X to reset the play range 
and play back the animation. Great work!
How it works...
Text behaviors preceded by the word Out are meant to animate the text off screen. By default, 
when you apply them to text they are always added at the beginning. Make sure you don't 
forget to move the behavior in the mini-Timeline to where you want your text to animate out  
so you can achieve your intended result.

The Sequence Text recipe
Sequence Text
There is one text behavior that rules them all! It couldn't be said better when we look at 
Sequence Text. All the animations you see in the various categories started from Sequence 
Text. Let's see how we can make some custom text animations!
Getting ready
Double-click on the 05_06 project from the exercise folder for this chapter. This project 
consists of a background and some static text. We're going to customize an animation  
to have the text come on and off the screen while exploring some of the various options 
available to us by using sequence text.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
184
How to do it...
Let's begin by adding the Sequence Text behavior.
1.	 Select Text in the Layers tab and press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Select 
Behaviors | Text Animation | Sequence Text. Click the Apply button.
2.	 With the text still selected, press F2 to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. At 
first, the sequence text has no default animation. We need to pick a parameter we 
want to change. After adjusting the value, Sequence Text will ramp from the value we 
specify to the state our text is in now.
3.	 From the parameter menu, go to Add | Format | Position as shown in the following 
screenshot. Under Position, change the Y value to 220. Play back the animation. The 
text drops in character by character over the entire length of the project. Let's change 
a few of the settings.

4.	 Move to 1 second. Select the Sequence Text behavior and press O to trim the  
out-point to the playhead. Under Controls, change the value of Spread to 6 and  
the Direction to Backwards. Play back the animation to see how the text reacts.
5.	 Change the value of Direction back to Forwards, Spread to 2, and change the value 
of Unit Size to Word. Also change the Speed to Ease Both.
6.	 From the Parameter menu, choose Add | Format| Opacity and Add | Face | Blur. 
Change the Opacity value to 0 and the Blur value to 30 as shown in the following

duplicate it. Move to the end of the project. Press Shift + ] to move the duplicate 
behavior to the playhead. Rename it to Sequence Text Out. In the Behaviors tab, 
with the Sequence Text Out behavior selected, change the position of the Y value  
to -220, Sequencing to To, and Direction to Backwards. Play back the animation.

Once you master Motion's sequence text, you can put those skills to use in FCP X. In the text 
library within FCP X, you'll find Custom text, as shown in the following screenshot. It has most 
of the control settings that Motion's Sequence Text has.

Using the Transform Glyph tool
The Transform Glyph tool allows us to adjust the individual characters of our text with ease 
and precision directly in the Canvas. Combine it with the Sequence Text behavior and we can 
make our animations come to life by dragging our text to where we want it to start.
Getting ready
Double-click on the 05_07 project from the exercise folder for this chapter folder. Play back 
the animation. This project consists of an animated alarm clock and some text.
How to do it...
We're going to begin by changing the size of a few characters.
1.	 Underneath the Selection tool, select the Transform Glyph tool as shown in the 
following screenshot:

2.	 Press F7 to bring up the HUD. Click on the letter M in the Canvas. Adjust its scale in 
the HUD to around 190, as shown in the following screenshot. Option + click to the left 
and right of the slider to increase the size by one. Repeat this step for the letter R:
3.	 Select Ring the Alarm in the Layers tab. Go to the gear icon to the right of the Canvas 
and select Text Animation | Sequence Text. Move to 2 seconds in the mini-Timeline 
and press O to trim the behavior's out-point. Press Command + Option + O to move the 
play range out-point to the playhead. Move to the beginning of the project.
4.	 Click on the letter R. Press Command + - a few times to zoom out on the Canvas. In the 
HUD, change the value of Unit Size value to Line. Hold down the Shift key and click on 
the top circle. Drag the text to the right to rotate it by 45 degrees on the x axis.
5.	 Select the blue arrow and drag it to the right to move your characters offscreen. 
Change the Speed to Ease Both. Play back the animation. Try changing the value 
of Unit Size to Word and the value of Direction to Random. Play around with the 
settings until you're happy with the animation. Use the following screenshot to help 
guide you:

Saving your favorite text animations and 
styles
As a motion graphics designer, you have a responsibility to work efficiently. One way to save 
time is to save your favorite animations for future use. Let's take a look at how we can save 
our own animations that we can use over and over again.
Getting ready
Under the exercise folder for this chapter, folder open the 05_08 project. This project consists 
of a background and text layer. The project is 3D so it allows us to add lights that interact with 
our scene! We'll learn about this later but for now take a second to explore and see how this 
project was constructed.
How to do it...
We're going to save the text style and basic attributes associated with this text so that we can 
easily apply it to other text layers that we might have in our project.
1.	 Select the Imagine text and press F4 to go to the Text tab of the Inspector. Go to the 
Format pane at the very top under the Style Presets menu click and choose Save 
All Basic + Style Attributes as shown in the following screenshot. Name the preset 
BGothic, Grad, Glow and Shadow.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
190
2.	 Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Select Text Styles; note that your preset is 
saved as shown in the following screenshot. Turn off the Imagine layer and turn on 
the Apply layer by clicking on the checkmark box next to it in the Layers tab. Drag the 
preset over to the Apply text. Look how easy that was compared to adjusting all the 
settings again!
3.	 Let's see how we can do this with text behaviors we create with sequence text! Go to 
the File menu and open the 05_08_01 project. Play back the project. Take a second 
to explore the various filters, behaviors, masks, and lights that were used to make the 
project. If you're going through this book chronologically, you'll find out more about 
this in the later chapters.
4.	 We want to copy the Sequence Text behavior from the Imagine text to apply to clips 
in the Timeline. Option + click the checkmark next to Imagine to solo it. Move to 4 
seconds in the Timeline. Select the behavior on the Imagine text and press F2 to go 
the Behaviors tab. Both scale and position have been adjusted on the Sequence 
Text behavior to create the animation you see. Press Command + 2 to go to the 
Library. Select Favorites and drag the Sequence Text from the Layers tab directly  
into the Favorites folder. Rename it Scale 400 and Z Position Move.
5.	 Create a new project, add some text, and apply the preset behavior to it from the 
Library! How easy was that! Use the following screenshot for reference:

Using vector images from the Special 
Characters library
We can't talk about text without talking about the vector images that are available to us 
through Special Characters. It opens up a world of motion graphic possibilities as we can fly 
in on these images with cameras, and put them in replicator and particle systems, creating 
complex animations.
How to do it...
We start with creating a new project for this exercise.
1.	 Create a 720p project, 10 seconds long at 30 FPS.

2.	 Press T to select the type tool and click somewhere close to the center of the Canvas. 
Go to the Edit menu and select Special Characters from the list as shown in the 
following screenshot:
3.	 Under Symbols, go to Miscellaneous, and locate the skull and crossbones image (the 
location of these images may be different depending on your current operating system). 
With the image selected, click on Insert located on the bottom-right of the window. 
Press the Esc key to exit the text entry mode and then F7 to bring up the HUD.
4.	 Change the value of Size to 288, center align your image, and drag it into the Canvas 
to center it to the screen using your dynamic guides to help you. While we can't scale 
the image any further in the HUD, we can scale this value infinitely in the Format 
pane of the Text tab. Press F4 to go there.
5.	 Change the value of Size to 500. Go to the Style pane and change the color to a 
gradient of your liking and add any additional changes you want. Use the following 
screenshot for reference.

Using videos and textures to fill text
We're going to take a quick look at how we can fill our text with something other than a solid or 
gradient color by using video. In this exercise, we're going to apply a blend mode on our text to 
achieve the desired result.
Getting ready
Find a piece of video and create a project based on its dimensions, frame rate, and duration. 
Go to File Browser and navigate to the location where the file is. Make sure you're on the first 
frame of your project and select Import to bring it in.
How to do it...
Let's begin by creating some text.
1.	 Select the text icon in the toolbar underneath the Canvas and type out MOVING 
FORWARD. Press Esc and F7. Select a nice, thick font such as Aerial Black as  
shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Select the text and press F1 to go to the Properties tab. From the pop-up list  
under Blending Mode, select Stencil Luma. Your image is now contained in the 
text. If it seems to have got lost on the screen, try duplicating the text by pressing 
Command + D.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
195
3.	 On the duplicate, change the value of Blending Mode to Normal. Press F4 to  
go to the Text tab and click on the Style pane. Turn off the Face option and turn  
on Outline. Select a width and color of your liking. Use the following screenshot  
for reference:
4.	 Making sure all layers are in the same group, select the Group layer, press  
Command + 2 to go to the Library, and under Behaviors select Basic Motion | 
Grow/Shrink. Click on Apply to add it to the Group layer and tweak it to your liking. 
Play back your animation.
There's more…
We can achieve a similar effect by filling the face of our text with a texture. Under the Style 
pane and under Face, Select Texture as the Fill With option. Drop the video into the source 
well that appears and then turn off your video clip in the Layers tab. Use the following 
screenshot for reference:

Creating a lower third for FCP X
Sometimes you may want to use something from Motion in one of your FCP X projects. It's very 
common to have projects where we need to utilize the same text design across the project 
making slight tweaks to it along the way. This exercise is a preview to Chapter 11, Publishing 
your Work to FCP X, which goes into much greater detail about publishing and rigging your work 
for FCP X.
Getting ready
Under the exercise folder for this chapter, open the 05_12 project. Play back the project.  
A lower third moves from offscreen to onscreen while some placeholder text fades in. It then 
stays static and disappears offscreen again. What you may not see is that it's set up to be 
used in FCP X. If you take a look at the project extension right above the Canvas, you'll notice 
it's a .moti file. When creating this project, I chose to save it as Final Cut Title in order 
to have it available in FCP X'S media browser.
How to do it...
Let's get a closer look at this project.
1.	 In the Layers tab, open up the Lower Third Contents group and then the Lower Third 
Bars group. There are four still layers in here that have all been masked in order to 
create a textured lower third bar. The ultimate goal here was to allow someone the 
option to choose which bar they would like to use in FCP X. A rig was set up in order  
to achieve this.
2.	 To see the rig, select Bars Pop-Up in the Layers tab and look at the Widget tab of 
the Inspector. Press F4 if it's not visible. Under Bars Pop-Up, go through each of the 
four different types of background bars. Make sure your playhead is at a place where 
the text has animated on the screen. The Opacity parameter of each still layer was 
added to the rig. You can see that the Opacity value was set to 0 or 100 depending 
on whether that layer was selected or not. Use the following screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
197
3.	 Before we make this available in FCP X, there's one more thing to look at. At the top of 
the Timeline, you may have noticed these two green triangular marks and the section 
in between them identified by an orange highlight. These are known as Optional 
Build In and Optional Build Out markers. They were created to allow the user in 
FCP X to increase or decrease the length of the text animations. It also prevents the 
middle section from getting highlighted due to the unnecessary change in speed.
4.	 Let's bring it into FCP X. From the File menu, select Save. Name the template as 
My Lower Third. Save it to the Lower Thirds category and create a new theme 
called Custom Lower Thirds. Make sure Use Unused Media is unchecked and Save 
Preview Movie is checked. Click on Publish.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Text
198
5.	 Open FCP X and create a new project. Navigate to your Title Browser. Go to the Lower 
Thirds category on your left and find your text. Drag it in to the Timeline. Select the text 
in the Timeline and click on the i icon to go to the Inspector. Click on the Title tab and 
change between the Bars-Pop Up states. Play back the animation. Uncheck Build In 
and play back the animation again. Congrats, you've just completed another chapter!

Introduction
Paint is an extremely fun and versatile tool in Motion. It allows us to use a collection of built-in 
brush strokes in all of our motion graphics projects. Whether we're accentuating text, creating 
an organic pattern across the screen, or animating strokes to bring us in a scene, Paint gets 
the job done.
Using the Paint Stroke tool
Let's take a look at some of the basics the Paint tool has to offer. The Paint tool is located  
on the toolbar just to the right-hand side of the Pen tool. You can also select it by pressing  
the P key.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
200
Getting ready
Launch Motion and choose a project with a Preset of Broadcast 720p and a Frame Rate of 
29.97 with a Duration of 10 seconds. Press Shift + Z to fit the Canvas window. Press the T 
key or click on the T icon on the toolbar to select the Text tool and click somewhere close to 
the center of the Canvas. Type The Paint Tool and press the Esc key to exit the text entry 
mode. Use the dynamic guides to help center your text on the screen. Press the F7 key to 
show the HUD. Pick a font and size of your liking.
How to do it...
Now that your text has been formatted, it's time to paint some strokes onscreen.
1.	 Press the P key to select the Pen tool or click on the brush icon to the left of the Text 
tool. With your HUD displaying, change the width of your stroke to 15.
2.	 Choose a blue color. Set the Pen Pressure to Width and the Pen Speed to Nothing. 
Make sure Write On is selected. Now with everything set, make sure your playhead is 
at the beginning of the mini-Timeline.
3.	 Draw out your Paint stroke underneath the text. Nothing is shown immediately. Press 
the Space bar to play the project.
Unlike the Write On behavior we've used in the past, notice that 
the shape is written onscreen based on the speed at which you 
drew the stroke. If we wanted to customize the speed, we would 
need to change the behavior settings.
4.	 Select the Write On behavior. In the HUD, change the Speed from Recording to 
Natural. Move your playhead to 3 seconds on the mini-Timeline and trim the behavior 
to extend to this point as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
201
5.	 Select the Paint layer and press the F4 key to go to the Shape tab of the Inspector. 
Notice under the Style pane that Fill is turned off and Outline is turned on as shown 
in the following screenshot. A paint stroke is simply an outline. We'll see in later 
exercises how we can create paint outlines using the Line tool.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
202
6.	 As a final step, click on the Geometry pane under the Shape tab of the Inspector. 
You'll notice your shape is a series of control points. If our objective was to straighten 
out the paint stroke, we could match all of our Y coordinates to the same number. 
Click on each Y coordinate for each point and make the values match. You can use 
the Tab key to navigate to each coordinate. Change the Shape Type to Linear, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
There's more…
Under the Selection tool in the toolbar is an Edit Points tool as seen in the following 
screenshot. If you have a Paint layer selected, with this tool you can adjust the control  
points of your paint stroke directly in the Canvas. Please note that it works on gradients  
and masks as well.

Changing Shape Style and Width Over Stroke
After you initially format your paint, it's time to look at the stylistic, stroke, and advanced 
options available to you to create extremely organic paint strokes across the screen.
Getting ready
Open the 06_02 project from the exercise folder for this chapter. This is a version of the 
project we created in the previous exercise. Play back the project and stop the playhead  
after the paint stroke has animated onscreen or at the 3 second mark.
How to do it...
1.	 Press the F7 key to show the HUD. While we chose a solid line stroke in the  
last exercise, Motion ships with a ton of pre-set brush strokes. Some of  
them are pre-animated; others can be animated with the Write On behavior.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
204
From the Shape Style menu, choose Iron Filings from under Textural, as  
shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
205
2.	 Press the F4 key to open the Inspector. Select the Stroke tab. There are a lot of 
settings in here. One thing you can do is vary the length of the spacing and width 
across the stroke. Let's see how we can do that by using the Width Over Stroke 
property. Click on the disclosure triangle next to it in the Inspector to reveal a graph 
as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 If you look in the Canvas and compare it to the graph, you'll notice the edges of the 
stroke are thinner than the center. Let's say we want to reverse it so the edges are 
thicker and the center thinner. Drag the keyframe on the left-hand side edge up to 
the number 300. Do the same for the keyframe on the right-hand side. Look at the 
results in your Canvas and compare it with the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
206
The following is a screenshot of the graph after we've made the mentioned changes:
4.	 We can also add keyframes by clicking on the line to vary the stroke even more. 
Drag the middle keyframe up to 200. Double-click in between the first and second 
keyframe. Drag the point underneath the middle point to around a value of 100. 
Adjust the Bezier handles to taste. Repeat this step to add a point between the final 
two keyframes. Use the following screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
207
There's more...
Here are a few pointers to customize your paint strokes for a more automated workflow.
Saving paint strokes as presets
You can save any of your paint strokes as a preset just like text. From the Shape Style menu in 
the HUD or Inspector, simply choose Save Preset and give your setting a name. Besides your 
being able to select these presets from the Paint tool, they are also saved in the Library.
There are also a ton of creative possibilities available for what you can use as a source for 
your brush. This is a tip on using a still image or even a movie file as the source.
Using a still image or MOV file as a stroke source
Motion offers a variety of possibilities for the different stroke sources you can use. For 
instance, you can bring in a Photoshop logo or PNG file into your project and, in the Shape tab 
under the Style pane, drop that logo into the Brush Source well as indicated in the following 
screenshot. Try doing it with text and movie files too. Just make sure to bring it into your 
project first and turn it off if you're only using it for the brush stroke.
Using Sequence Paint
To take your brush stroke animations to the next level, look no further than Sequence Paint. 
Like Sequence Text, all prebuilt Paint animations come from this behavior. In this exercise, 
we'll look at some of the options available to us with this behavior.
Getting ready
Open the 06_03 project from the exercise folder of this chapter.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
208
How to do it...
In this exercise, we're going to animate some brush stokes on top and underneath some text.
1.	 Press Shift + Z if necessary to fit the project to the Canvas window. Play back the 
project. The play range has been set to play the first 3 seconds of the project. The text 
grows over time while the brush stroke is waiting to be animated. Select Paint in the 
Layers tab and click on the gear icon underneath the Canvas. Select Sequence Paint 
from under Shape, as indicated in the following screenshot. Trim the behavior so it 
ends at 2 seconds.
2.	 Press the F2 key to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. If you went through 
the recipe on Sequence Text in the previous chapter, some of these parameters will 
look familiar to you. Let's add a few parameters to animate the text. From the Add 
Parameter list, choose Color. Click on the color well and choose a red color of your 
liking. Play back the animation. The stroke animates to the color red. Change the 
Sequencing Parameter to From. Now it goes from the color red.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
209
3.	 From the Add Parameter list add Position and Scale. Change the Scale to 0 and the 
Position X to -600 and Y to -430 as shown in the following screenshot. Change the 
Spread to 20.
If you play back the animation, you should see the text animating similar to the 
following screenshot:
4.	 The text animates from the lower-left corner of the screen to its original position over 
2 seconds. Let's smooth out the animation by easing the values. Change Reversal 
to Ease in/Out. As a final step, let's duplicate the brush stroke, move the copy, and 
animate it from the opposite direction.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
210
5.	 Select the Paint layer and press Command + D to duplicate it. Move the copy of the 
paint stroke above the text using your Canvas controls. You can hold down the Shift 
key to constrain its movement to just up and down. Press the F2 key to go to the 
Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Change the Position values to 600 and 430 for X 
and Y respectively. Play back the animation and compare it to what you see in the 
following screenshot:
The relationship between shapes and Paint
When you start to dig deep and look under the hood of Motion, you'll start to see that several 
different tools and systems that exist are derived from the same engine. Nothing could be 
more true about shapes and Paint. Let's take a look to see how they're related.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
211
How to do it...
In this exercise, we're going to create a shape and see how we can turn it into a brush stroke.
1.	 Launch Motion and choose a project with a Preset of Broadcast 720p, Frame Rate 
of 29.97, and with a Duration of 8 seconds. Press Shift + Z to fit the Canvas window. 
Select the Line tool underneath the Rectangle tool on the toolbar as shown in the 
following screenshot. Make sure you're at the beginning of the project.
2.	 Drag a line across the screen, holding down the Shift key to keep it straight. Press the 
Esc key to go back to the Selection tool and the F7 key to bring up the HUD.
3.	 Change the line to a color of your choosing and notice in the following screenshot 
how the icon next to the Line in the Layers tab is the same icon next to the layers  
we painted on in the previous recipe.
4.	 With the Line selected, press the F4 key to go to the Shape tab of the Inspector. 
From the top of the Style Pane under Shape Style, navigate to Abstract | Ideal 
Form. Notice under the outline section that the brush source is filled with an image 
that happens to be the cubes from "Ideal Form". This is exactly how we filled the 
objects we painted on the screen in the previous recipes. Increase the Width to 61 
and the Spacing to 110 to see this better.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
212
5.	 All of the options available for Paint are available for the line we just created. Go 
to the Stroke Pane in the Inspector. Change the Stroke Color Mode parameter to 
Color Over Stroke. The cubes fill with a gradient. From the Gradient preset menu 
that you can see in the following screenshot, choose Sundown. Increase the Color 
Repetitions to 100.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
213
6.	 Click on the disclosure triangle for Spacing Over Stroke. Double-click on the Line a 
few times to add a few keyframes. Adjust it to vary the spacing in between the cubes. 
See the following screenshot as reference:
Using shape masks
While we can use Motion's shape tools to create shapes, every once in a while it's nice to use 
shapes to conceal or mask part of an object. Let's see how we can use our shape mask tools 
in Motion to do that in a practical situation.
Getting ready
Open the 06_05 project from the exercise folder of this chapter. The project consists of a 
frame from Motion's library and a picture of a cat we've used in previous exercises. We would 
like the cat picture to fit the frame of the oval picture. The best way to achieve this is to use 
the Circle Mask tool.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
214
How to do it...
By adding the Circle Mask tool to the the picture, we'll be able to mask out the part of the 
image we don't want.
1.	 Select the Circle Mask tool from the toolbar. You'll find it to the right-hand  
side of the Text tool and underneath the Rectangle Mask, tool as shown  
in the following screenshot:
2.	 Draw out an oval shape, roughly the size of the oval frame. Adjust the position and 
size of the mask to get it in place as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Press the F7 key to bring up the HUD. Click on the box next to Invert Mask. This 
allows us to easily reverse our selection for those instances where we want to  
discard what's inside the mask and keep what's on the outside. Click on the  
box again to disable inversion.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
215
4.	 Increase Feather to 154 and change the color of your mask as desired.
There's more…
There are limitations to the items that you can draw masks on in Motion. Items such as text 
cannot have a mask on them. To get around this limitation, simply place the Text layer within a 
group and mask the group.
Creating a garbage matte for a green screen
One of the first steps when you're dealing with green screens is to mask out the unwanted 
areas of your image before applying a Keyer filter to remove the green. This allows the Keyer 
filter to work a little less hard because it has fewer colors it needs to remove. Let's see how  
we can easily add a mask using the Bezier Mask tool within Motion.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
216
Getting ready
Locate a piece of green screen footage preferably a shot with little to no camera movement. 
Create a Motion project that matches the resolution settings, frame rate, and duration of your 
clip. Make sure you are at the beginning of your project and bring the clip into the Canvas by 
importing it from the File Browser. Play back the clip and become familiar with your shot. The 
object here is to make a mask around what you want to keep. If the subject is moving, it would 
be best to find a frame where the action of your subject is the most extended (that is, when their 
hands or feet extend out from where they are standing). Once you've identified the frame, move 
your playhead to that location and select the clip.
How to do it...
Let's add a garbage mask around our clip using the Bezier Mask tool.
1.	 Select the Bezier Mask tool from the toolbar as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 The Bezier Mask tool allows you to draw a custom mask shape. With your mouse, 
click on a point just outside where your subject is. Continue to click and add points 
around your subject as shown in the following screenshot. If you click-and-drag, you 
can bend the points rather than have them as linear.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
217
3.	 When you come back to your first point, hover your mouse over it and notice how a 
closed-fill circle appears. Click on it in order to close the shape.
4.	 Play back the project to make sure your subject does not get cut off. If it does,  
adjust the control points in the Canvas. You can also select the mask in the Layers 
tab and go to the Inspector by pressing the F4 key to adjust the control points there, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
There's more...
If your green screen subject moves a lot, you can easily keyframe the control points of your 
mask by turning on Record keyframes in the Canvas by pressing the A key. Simply move 
frame-by-frame throughout the project and adjust your control points accordingly. Please  
note that all changes you make will be recorded.

Getting ready
From the exercise files for this chapter, double-click on the 06_07 project. There are two layers 
in the project; a still of the TV screen and a movie file. You can temporarily disable the visibility 
of the still by clicking on the check mark next to it in the Layers tab. Our goal here is to mask 
out the center of the TV screen and replace it with the video clip that we will scale down and 
rotate so that it fits. As a bonus step, we'll bring back in some of the black color from the 
screen to make the shot more realistic.
How to do it...
Let's find the Bezier Mask tool to choose the selection we need to remove.
1.	 Select the Bezier Mask tool from the toolbar as shown in the following  
screenshot. Press Command + = to zoom in on your Canvas so that we  
can add precise control points.
2.	 Click around the TV screen in order to enclose the portion we want to remove.  
Click on the first point you created in order to close the mask as shown in the 
following screenshot:

3.	 Right now, we have selected the portion of the shot we wish to remove. To reverse 
this, press the F7 key to bring up the HUD. Click on the square next to Invert Mask to 
reverse the selection. Add a small amount of feather to help blend the shots together, 
as shown in the following screenshot. Tweak your control points around the mask to 
make your selection as precise as possible.
4.	 Select the movie file and zoom out on your Canvas by pressing Command + -.  
Click-and-drag one of the outer circles of your clip to scale down your object while 
holding down the Shift key to constrain the size. Reposition the clip so it fits in the  
TV screen and rotate it along the z axis so it matches the perspective.

5.	 Select the TV screen layer and press Command + D to duplicate it. Select the Bezier 
Mask on the duplicate and, in the HUD, click on the checkmark next to Invert Mask 
to reverse the selection. Now select the TV screen copy and bring down its Opacity to 
50. Make more changes as you see fit.

Applying multiple masks to an image and 
changing mask modes
Sometimes it's necessary to apply multiple masks to an image to get your desired selection.  
At other times, multiple masks can be used to animate and reveal only specific portions of 
your image, creating dynamic motion graphics. Let's see some of the options available to us 
when we start combining multiple masks on a clip.

Chapter 6
221
Getting ready
From the exercise folder of this chapter, double-click on the 06_08 project file. Play back the 
project; it's a scenic shot of a beach. Our objective is to combine several masks across the 
image to make it appear as though we're looking at the image through the window of a jail 
cell. We'll achieve this by adding one mask and duplicating it several times. We'll use different 
mask modes to control the interaction between the masks.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the clip Rectangle Mask tool from the toolbar. You'll find it to the right-hand 
side of the Text tool.
2.	 Click-and-drag a narrow Rectangular Mask from the top-center of the screen to the 
bottom. Press the F7 key to bring up the HUD and click on the empty square next to 
Invert Mask, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
222
3.	 Select the Rectangular Mask and press Command + D to duplicate it. Move the 
duplicate over to the right-hand side and don't be alarmed when you don't see 
anything. The reason we can't is because of the default mask blend mode and the 
fact that both masks are inverted. In the HUD, change the duplicate mask's blend 
mode to Subtract as shown in the following screenshot. Then, click the checkmark 
next to Invert Mask.
4.	 Select Rectangle Mask Copy and press Command + D eight times. Select each copy 
and spread them out across the screen; the alignment doesn't have to be exact.
5.	 In the Layers tab, click on the first mask and Shift + click on the last to have  
all ten selected. Go to the Object menu and choose Align Top Edges from under 
Alignment. Go to the Object menu again and choose Distribute Horizontal Centers 
from under Alignment.

223
6.	 As a final step, select the Movie layer and, from the toolbar, grab the Rectangle 
Mask tool. Draw a rectangle across the entire image encompassing the top and 
bottom of the lifeguard house. In the HUD, change the value of Mask Blend Mode to 
Intersect. Use the following screenshot for reference. We see our image only where 
each of our mask layers intersect.

Getting ready
Under the exercise folder of this chapter, double-click on the 06_09 project file. Play back the 
project; it's a series of animated blurred circles moving across the screen from right to left. 
In this project, there is also a Video clip layer that has been turned off. Click on the empty 
square next to it to turn it on. Our goal is to have our video play with the circles onscreen. We 
can use either the luminance or transparency of the Bokeh group to achieve this. 
How to do it...
We're going to add an image mask to the Video layer in this project.
1.	 Select the Video layer and from the Object menu choose Add Image Mask, as shown 
in the following screenshot. An image mask becomes applied to the video image but 
it needs a source.
2.	 Drag the Bokeh group over the top of the image mask in the Layers tab and release 
your mouse when you see a hooked arrow. Notice the Bokeh group is turned off 
automatically. Motion assumes that, when you use an object or group as an image 
mask, you don't want to see it on the Canvas.
3.	 Play back the clip and notice how the video only appears in the circles. Try 
experimenting with different sources from Motion's Library to see the different  
type of results you can get.

If your image mask source does not contain an Alpha channel (a fourth channel of information 
on a video clip that creates transparency), which is the default mode, simply change it to 
Luminance to see if you get your desired result. This effect depends on the contrast in your 
footage. For example, a quick way to create a reflection is to use a black-and-white gradient as 
a source for an image mask while setting the mode to Luminance, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Anything covered by black in the image will be masked out, anything covered by gray 
will be partially transparent, and anything covered by white will be fully opaque.

When you duplicate layers and combine masks, you can create some pretty cool animations 
and effects. Let's take a look at how we can animate a glow across a logo while it scales  
up over time.
www.it-ebooks.info

Paint and Masks
226
Getting ready
Under the exercise folder of this chapter, double-click on the 06_10 project file. The project 
consists of two logo groups; Logo glow and Logo. The image used was an Illustrator file. In 
order, to scale it up without distortion, we went to the Media tab of the Inspector and turned 
off Fixed Resolution. If you look inside the Logo Glow group, you should see several copies of 
the logo each containing a glow filter. To create this dynamic glow, duplicating the logo, as well 
as changing the blend mode between the layers, was needed. The Logo group only contains 
the Illustrator layer and no glow. Our goal is to create a mask around the Logo Glow group 
and animate it so that it's only seen for a few seconds.
How to do it...
Let's create a mask to animate one of our logo layers.
1.	 Zoom out on the Canvas by pressing Command + -. Select the Logo Glow group. 
From the toolbar, select the Bezier Mask tool underneath the Rectangle Mask tool. 
Click to create control points of your choosing off to the side. Make sure the length 
of the shape you create is enough to cover the logo. Click on the first point to close 
the shape. The glow disappears. It's still there but the mask we created does not 
encompass that group.

3.	 With the mask still selected and the playhead at the beginning of the project, press 
the A key to activate Record Keyframes. Click on the mask and nudge it to force a 
keyframe. Move to 3 seconds. Drag the mask up and offscreen to the right. Press  
the A key to deactivate Record Keyframes and play back the project. Adjust the  
mask points to taste by selecting the mask, Ctrl + clicking on the Canvas, and 
choosing Edit Points.
4.	 Select both logo groups in the Layers tab and navigate to Object | Group. With the 
new group selected, go to the gear icon in the toolbar and choose Grow/Shrink from 
under Basic Motion. Change the behavior in the HUD as desired.

Introduction
The particle systems in Motion 5 are a powerful engine by which we can take nearly any 
object, image, layer, or group and animate it using the parameters available to us in the HUD 
and Inspector. A particle system consists of two items—the emitter and the cell. The cell is 
referenced by the emitter and the emitter creates the animation over a lifespan specified 
by you. Let's say we had a PNG layer of an orange. If we created particles out of it, that 
orange would be put into a cell that is referenced by the emitter. You could use the emitter's 
parameters to duplicate that orange multiple times per second and have it animate in a 
particular direction until you decide it should end or die. On top of the ability to turn nearly 
anything your heart desires into particles, in Motion's library there are pre-animated particle 
emitters available to incorporate in all of your animations.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles

Making particles and changing values in the 
HUD
Let's take a look at how we can create a particle system using a shape from Motion's library 
and tweak a few of its parameters using the HUD.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 07_01 project. There is the Shape layer in 
the Layers tab, whose scale has been animated to repeat for the duration of the project. Our 
goal is to place the heart in a particle system so that we can have hundreds rain down onto 
the Canvas.
How to do it...
The following steps will take you through creating your first particle system:
1.	 Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of your project. Select the Pink Heart 
layer and press E, or from the toolbar choose Create a particle emitter (the icon with 
the three bubbles rising up, as shown in the following screenshot):
2.	 Play back the project. Several things just happened after you pressed that button. 
In the Layers tab, notice that the Pink Heart layer has been turned off. A cell and 
emitter have been created just above it. The cell holds information about the heart 
while the emitter is creating all the duplicate copies of the heart that are shooting 
out in a 360-degree circle across the screen at the same speed. You can see 
a screenshot of this next. Press F7 to bring up the HUD and see some of these 
parameters in more detail:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
231
3.	 Right now, thirty hearts are being born every second and live for a duration of five 
seconds where they pop off the screen. All the duplicate hearts also hold the original 
scale of the heart being referenced. Change the Birth Rate value to 5 and Life to 10. 
Bring down the Scale parameter to 50, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
232
4.	 Instead of having the hearts come from the center of the screen, let's have them rain 
down from the top of the Canvas. Decrease the size of your Canvas by clicking on 
it and pressing Command + - a few times. Select the particle emitter and drag it up 
and offscreen. Use the Shift key to constrain the movement. Change the Emission 
Range slider from 360 to 180 and make sure the arrows point down. Play back the 
animation and tweak the Birth Rate and Scale sliders as desired. See the following 
screenshot for reference:
There's more…
If you're finding the HUD limited in terms of the options available to you for the emitter,  
don't worry, the Inspector has several additional parameters, including the option  
to add random values to your emitter that will add more realism to it! Take a peak at  
the following screenshot:

Let's Make Particles
234
Tweaking particle parameters in the 
Inspector
In the previous recipe, we switched a few parameters in the HUD for our particle system of 
hearts, but if we're looking to fine-tune our animation, we need to go to the Inspector. Let's 
take a look at the several additional parameters available.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 07_02 project. Play back the project.  
There is a particle system in the center of the Canvas being emitted in the form of a rectangle. 
Currently, thirty hearts are being born every second and live for five seconds. We're going to 
tweak our particle system to change the flow of the animation so that our hearts emit out in a 
circle and away from the screen.
How to do it...
By following these steps, we'll gain a better understanding of how we can control the  
particle system:
1.	 Select the Emitter in the Layers tab. Press F4 to open the Emitter tab of the 
Inspector. Change the Shape menu's option from rectangle to circle and the 
Arrangement option to Random Fill. Set the radius to 500.
2.	 Increase Birth Rate to 200 and set Speed in Cell Controls to 0. If you play back  
the project, you'll see the hearts trying to form the shape of a circle. Since there  
is no speed value, the hearts stay put in the shape they originate from, as shown  
in this screenshot:
3.	 Set Angle Value to 15 and Spin to 30.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
235
4.	 Rather than having the particles pop onscreen when they're born and pop offscreen 
when they die, we're going to add some tags to the Opacity Over Life parameter.  
The trick is to click the white line where we want to add a tag above it. Click the  
line once close to the beginning and twice close to the end. Use the following 
screenshot for reference:
5.	 Click on the first tag and under the line, drag the Opacity slider to 0 (indicated in this 
screenshot). Repeat this step for the last slider. Now the hearts fade in at birth and 
fade out at death:
6.	 As a final step, we're going to keyframe the speed of the particle system to start at 
100 percent and eventually go down to 0 to reveal the shape of the circle we created. 
Go to the beginning of the Timeline and click the diamond icon next to Speed to add a 
keyframe. Change its value to 100. Move to three seconds and add another keyframe 
by clicking the diamond icon next to Speed again. Move to three seconds and set 
Speed to 0. Play back the animation and compare it to the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
236
There's more...
You can create some amazing animations by changing the type of shape used to emit 
particles. For instance, if you change the shape of your particles to Image and use text as  
the source, the particles will spell out the word as long there is a substantial number of hearts 
being born and the Arrangement option is set to Random Fill. We'll see an example of this in 
a later exercise, but the following screenshot gives you a sneak peak on the end results you 
can get:
Adding randomness values
To give your particle systems just a little more, we're going to add a little randomness to some 
of the parameters. This randomness will help give your animations a more organic feel.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 07_03 project. Play back the project. The 
particle system consists of little demograms that rain down from a line. The Angle and Spin 
values cause the demograms to rotate while moving, and the Opacity Over Life parameter 
allows each particle to fade in and out during its lifespan. The particles also change color over 
their life as reflected in the Color Mode menu and the gradient outlining the cycle. We're going 
to add randomness values to tweak the animation. Whenever we add a randomness value, it's 
going to look at the original value above it and add and subtract to it randomly every second 
based on the number you specify. For example, say the Scale value is set to 50. If you add a 
Scale randomness of 10, every second the demograms will be somewhere between a scale of 
40 and 60.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
237
How to do it...
Let's start to randomize different values in this recipe:
1.	 Select the emitter in the Layers tab and press F4. In the Emitter tab of the Inspector, 
change the Birth Rate Randomness slider's value to 10. Now, every second, 
somewhere between 10 and 30 objects are born.
2.	 Now, set Life Randomness to 3, Angle Randomness to 40, Spin Randomness to 50, 
and Scale Randomness to 80. Play back the project. Now we have our demograms 
growing at different sizes, being born at different angles and spinning at different rates! 
The following screenshot shows the Inspector with all of the mentioned changes and 
also a Color Over Life change (see the previous recipe to learn how to do it).
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
238
The following is a screenshot showing a frame of the particle animation in the Canvas 
with random values applied:
3.	 While playing back, click the Generate button next to Random Seed. You'll notice that 
your animation changes and a new number is created next to Generate. Random 
Seed takes all the random parameters and creates the animation based on this 
number. Change this number and change the randomness of the animation, as 
shown here:

Working with particle behaviors
While there are already a ton of parameters you can animate by keyframing their values in the 
particle and cell emitters, Motion offers you a few particle behaviors worth taking a look at 
from the library as well.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
239
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 07_04 project. Play back the project. The 
animation consists of a bouncing alarm clock from Motion's library in the foreground and 
a particle system referencing that alarm clock in the background. Unlike the other particle 
systems we've worked with in the previous recipes, the source of the particle system has been 
turned back on to preserve it. Our goal is to add two particle behaviors to have the clocks 
scale down and spin over its life cycle. By adjusting the speed and direction of our emitter, 
we will also have the clocks look like they're being pulled off into the distance. Also note, the 
anchor point of the clock was adjusted in advance in order to have the particles spin around 
the center of the clock.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the Particle group and select Emitter. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library 
tab. Under Behaviors, choose Particles | Spin Over Life. Click Apply.
2.	 Press F7 to open the HUD. Set Increment Type to Birth and Death Values. Set 
Birth to 360 and Death to 0. If you're having trouble, try changing the values in the 
Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Now, play back the animation.
3.	 Now, let's have the clocks in the particle system scale over life. Select the Emitter 
again. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Under Behaviors, choose Particles | 
Scale Over Life. Click Apply.
4.	 In the HUD, set Increment Type to Birth and Death Values. Set Scale at Birth to 
100 and Scale at Death to 0. If you're having trouble, try changing the values in the 
Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Play back the animation. The clocks now scale down 
gradually until they die, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
240
5.	 Press F4 to go to the Emitter tab of the Inspector. Change the Emission Longitude 
value to 180 and Speed to 2000, as shown in the following screenshot. Change the 
other parameters as desired.
There's more...
When you start building complex particle animations, keep in mind that you can save them to 
the Library as well as any of the behaviors you tweak. All particle presets can be found in the 
Library under Particle Emitters in a dedicated theme folder you create. The more time you 
spend automating your work, the more time you can dedicate to the creative process!

Working with particle presets
So far, we've created our own particle systems by selecting objects to place into cells 
referenced by the emitter. Motion ships with over 200 presets! One of the best ways to learn 
Motion is to dissect how some of the particle presets were created. Let's take a look at what  
it has to offer!
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
241
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise folder, double-click on the 07_05 project. There are two particle 
presets in this project but one has been turned off. Play back the project and familiarize yourself 
with the Magic Dust preset. Stop the playback. Turn off the Magic Dust group and turn on the 
Buskerit group. Play back the project again. In this recipe, we'll take a look at each of these 
presets and change a few parameters to look at how the animations were created.
How to do it...
Let's now tweak these parameters of our presets in more detail:
1.	 Reveal the content of the Buskerit group by clicking the disclosure triangle next to it. 
It contains a group called busker and seven still images that have been turned off. 
The images are being referenced by the emitter.
2.	 Click the disclosure triangle next to the Busker group. It contains the content of the 
Busker emitter and the seven cells that hold information from those layers that have 
been shot off. The Emitter also has a Scale Over Life behavior in it. While the object 
continually changes scale over the animation, the Scale Over Life behavior was used 
to animate the "pop-up" intro of the instruments, whereas keyframes were used to 
change the scale over the project.
3.	 Select the Scale Over Life behavior and press F2 to go to the Behaviors tab of the 
Inspector. Notice the Increment Type parameter set to Custom. Click the disclosure 
triangle next to Custom Scale to see the graph, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
242
4.	 Select the Emitter in the Layers tab and press Command + 8 to open the Keyframe 
Editor. Notice that both the scale and rotation of the emitter are keyframed periodically 
throughout the entire animation, as shown in the following screenshot. In the Keyframe 
Editor, press Shift + K to move forward between keyframes. Change the Rotation and 
Scale values by double-clicking the values while on an existing keyframe. You'll know 
you're on one because the diamond shape will appear highlighted!
5.	 Click the disclosure triangle to close the Buskerit group, turn it off, and turn on the 
Magic Dust group. Click the disclosure triangle to open it. A still image of a spark  
was used as the source for the Emitter. Several behaviors were used to animate  
the sparks.
6.	 With the emitter selected, press F4 to go to the Emitter tab of the Inspector.  
Set Emission Range to 45, Birth Rate to 200, and Speed to 1000. Play back  
the project to see the effect it has and compare it to the following:

Working with particle presets in 3D
Particle presets are already powerful on their own but turn them into 3D and you'll find that a 
few of them will actually look like they have been extruded. Let's take a look!
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise folder, double-click on the 07_06 project. Play back the 
project. There is a particle system of thin water being projected across the screen. Go to the 
Properties tab in the Inspector and click the rotation disclosure triangle to see the object 
rotate 90 degrees on its y axis. The water becomes invisible because it's flat the minute you 
change perspective. If we promote a particle system to 3D, we can get rid of this problem and 
have a few additional options available to us in terms of the way we emit the water.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
244
How to do it...
Let's get rid of the flatness of our particle system by making it 3D:
1.	 Select the Particle Emitter category and press F4 to go to the Inspector. Click on 
the 3D checkbox. As soon as you press the button, more options become available 
to you in the Emitter Controls section, including Emission Latitude and Emission 
Longitude, as seen here:
2.	 Two additional selections—Box and Sphere—also became available under the Shape 
drop-down. Click on the word Rectangle and choose Box.
3.	 Press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Click the disclosure triangle 
next to Scale and increase Scale Z to 200.

Chapter 7
245
4.	 Rotate the water 90 degrees on the Y axis and notice it's no longer flat. Use the 
following screenshot of the Properties tab for reference:
5.	 Go to the beginning of the Timeline and bring back Rotation Y to 0. Click the diamond 
shape next to Rotation Y to add a keyframe. Move to the end of the Timeline; and 
change the parameter to 720. Play back the project and see that, no matter what 
angle it is, the particle system never goes flat, as shown here:

Using an image sequence in a particle 
emitter
So far, all the content we've used for our particle emitters has been through selecting presets 
or using content through Motion's library. In this recipe, we're going to find a collection of 
photos on our drive to bring into Motion and use them as the source for our particle system.
Getting ready
Locate a collection of around 20 photos on your hard drive. It's best if these photos aren't 
extremely large in size, because we will be displaying several of them onscreen at once. Feel 
free to use your favorite photo-editing application to scale them down. We want Motion to 
see these photos as an image sequence; to do that, we'll need to give them the same name 
followed by a numerical number. The numbers assigned should be sequential. For example, 
if you have a set of photos with buildings, you'll call the first photo building_1, the second 
building_2, and so on. Once this is finished, launch Motion and choose a project with 
Duration set to 10 seconds, Preset set to 720p, and Frame Rate set to 30. When we go to 
the File Browser and find the image sequence, Motion will display only a single file containing 
all the photos as long as the Collapsed Image Sequence button is active. See the following 
screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
247
How to do it...
Let's take our image sequence and apply it to a particle system:
1.	 Make sure you are on the first frame of your project. Press Command + 1 to go  
to the File Browser. Find the image sequence, click on it and choose Import.  
Play back the project. The duration of the image sequence will be determined  
by the number of photos you have imported. Each photo plays for one frame in  
the order they were named.
2.	 Stop the playback and go back to the beginning of the project. With the image 
sequence selected, go to the Object menu and choose Make Particles, as shown here:

3.	 Press F7 to show the HUD. Set Birth Rate to 5, Life to 10, and Scale to 50. Change 
the Emission Range slider's value as desired. Play back the animation. The following 
screenshot is an example of what you could end up with:
4.	 Currently, the particle emitter is playing each photo in the image sequence. We want 
each photo born to be random, but not play through the entire image sequence. 
Press F4 to go to the Emitter tab of the Inspector. Uncheck Play Frames.
5.	 Click the disclosure triangle over Opacity Over Life and add three tags to create a 
fade-in effect and a fade-out effect over the image. Let's have our pictures form in the 
shape of some text.
6.	 Type a two or three letter word of your choice on screen. Make the size big and 
choose a thick font. Turn off the Text layer.

How it works
When we brought the image sequence into our project, we turned it into a particle system. By 
changing some of the particle parameters in the Inspector, we were able to tell the emitter to 
randomly display each photo.

Working with and manipulating multiple 
cells
In an earlier recipe, where we looked at particle presets in detail, we saw that an emitter can 
reference multiple cells. Let's take a look at how we can add additional cells to our project.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 07_08 project. Play back the project. There 
is a particle system in the project with one cell that's referencing the Atomic Cluster layer. 
By changing the values in the Inspector, I was able to change the color of the atoms over its 
life, have them fade in and out, and emit straight towards us. A gravity simulation behavior 
was added, so the particles appear to be falling too. In the Layers tab there is a group called 
Atom 02. We want this group to move with our particle system. We'll duplicate the existing cell 
and change the source. We'll also change the Random Seed value so that the objects don't 
occupy the same space.
www.it-ebooks.info

Let's Make Particles
250
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Atom Cluster cell and press Command + D to duplicate it. Drag the Atom 
02 group onto the duplicate cell layer to change its source.
2.	 If you play back the project, the cells are on top of each other. Select the duplicate 
cell and press F4 to open the Particle Cell tab of the Inspector. Click on the Generate 
button next to Random Seed to change the random parameters of the animation and 
play back the project.
3.	 Change the other values of the cell in the Inspector as desired and compare them to

Creating a tunnel through the frame effect
It's time to put our knowledge of particle systems to use and create a full system from scratch.
Getting ready
Launch Motion and choose a project with Duration set to 10 seconds, Preset set to 720p, 
and Frame Rate set to 30. Click Open. Go to the Library and, under Content, select Big 
Frame. Make sure you are on the first frame of the project and click Import. We're going to 
take this frame and place it into a particle system with Line as our chosen shape. We're going 
to make that line 3D and position it in 3D space. We'll then add a camera to our project and 
move across that line while frames are being born across it.
How to do it
1.	 Select the Big Frame layer and press E to turn it into a particle system. Select the 
Emitter and press F4 to go to the Emitter tab.
2.	 Change the Shape value of the Emitter to Line and click the 3D checkbox. Reveal 
the start and end points. Change both X positions to 0. Change the Z start point to 
-10000 and the Z end point to 10000, as shown here:
3.	 Set Emission Longitude to 270 and Emission Range to 360. Change the Birth 
Rate value to 13 and the Initial Number value to 50. Set Speed to 0. Set Angle 
Randomness to 360, Spin to 41, and Spin Randomness to 26.

4.	 Change Color Mode to Color Over Life. Change the color to a style preset or a color 
of your liking. Add the appropriate opacity tags to have each of the particles fade in 
and out. Use the following screenshot for your reference:
5.	 Move to six seconds. Add a keyframe to Birth Rate, Initial Number, and Life. Move to 
nine seconds and make all the values shown here 0:
6.	 Add a camera to the scene by going to the Object menu and choosing New Camera. 
Switch all your groups to 3D by clicking Yes. This will allow groups to interact with 
your camera. Make sure you are at the beginning of the project. With your camera 
selected, press F1 to go to the Properties tab. Twirl down the position properties and 
add a keyframe for Scale. Change its value to -8000. Move to the end of the Timeline 
and change the Position value to 6000. A keyframe is added automatically. Play back 
the animation to get the following result:

Creating your own Bokeh
You may have noticed an image called Bokeh in the Content or the Particle Emitter section of 
the Library. It creates a series of randomly blurred circles with bright highlights used to mimic 
a similar effect seen in photographs, usually on the background of the image. We're going to 
learn how we can create our own Bokeh from scratch.
Getting ready
Double-click the 07_10 project file from this chapter's exercise folder. The project consists 
of a group that has been turned off to act as the foreground of the project when we've done 
our Bokeh. Right now in the empty group, we're going to create a circle, add some filters, 
and throw it into a particle system. We will adjust the parameters and add some simulation 
behaviors to have it float offscreen left.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Bokeh group and go to the toolbar to select the Circle tool underneath the 
Rectangle tool. Shift + drag your mouse in the Canvas to create a small circle on the 
screen. Press the Esc key to move back to the selection tool.

Introduction
Whether you look at motion graphics on television or printed on a billboard, the images that 
we see are made and organized into patterns. Replicators in Motion 5 make the process 
of creating patterns and repeating designs extremely simple. We can even animate these 
replicator systems using behaviors and keyframes so that they move together as if they were 
in sync.
www.it-ebooks.info

Replicators – It's No Fun By Yourself
258
Replicators share similarities to particles, in that, when you create a replicator, the element 
you use is brought into a cell referenced by it. Unlike particles, replicators do not have life 
spans. They remain fixed on the screen from where you chose to create them. In Motion, 
almost any item (a group, video file, Photoshop still, or even a vector illustration) can be 
used as a source inside a replicator. The following cookbook recipes will introduce you to the 
fundamentals of using the replicator in Motion along with the main parameters, functions, 
and behavior parameters you should be familiar with in your replicating journey!
Creating a replicator and changing 
parameters in the HUD
Let's take a look at how we can create a replicator using a shape from Motion's Library and 
tweak a few of its parameters using the HUD!
Getting ready
Under the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_01 project. There is a Shape layer 
in the Layers tab whose rotation has been animated to repeat for the duration of the project. 
Our goal is to place the star in a replicator so that we can have a pattern in our Canvas.
How to do it...
1.	 Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of your project. Select the Star layer and 
press L; alternatively, from the toolbar choose Create a replicator (the icon with a 
grid of squares, as shown in the following screenshot).
2.	 Play back the project. Several things just happened after you pressed that button. In 
the Layers tab, notice the Star layer has been turned off. A cell and replicator have 
been created just above it. The cell holds information about the star while the emitter 
is creating all the duplicate copies of the star that remain stagnant on the screen in 
a rectangle pattern. The problem is that the rectangle is too small. Drag the square 
bound box handles in the Canvas to increase the size of the replicator shape. Keep 
increasing the size till it is evenly spread out across the Canvas. Press the F7 key to 
bring up the HUD and see some of these parameters in more detail.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8
259
3.	 Right now there are approximately 25 stars spread out in five columns and five 
rows in the shape of a rectangle. Unlike an emitter, the replicator stays static on the 
screen without a life span. The reason it's rotating is because the original star was 
keyframed. Let's change the value of Shape to Circle.
4.	 In the HUD, change the value of Arrangement from Tile Fill to Outline. Increase the 
value of Points to 9. In the Canvas, drag the circle handles to increase the size of the 
Radius until you can see all the stars as shown in the following screenshot. Play back 
the project.

Finding the HUD limited?
If you're finding the HUD limited in terms of the options available to you for the replicator, don't 
worry. The Inspector has several additional parameters for the replicator that we can't see 
in the HUD. They're hidden, but not because the parameters are used less often; they simply 
won't fit because there are so many of them. The following screenshot shows the available 
parameters in the Inspector:

The Tweaking replicator parameters in the Inspector recipe of this chapter
Tweaking replicator parameters in the 
Inspector
In the last recipe, we switched a few parameters in the HUD for our replicator of stars; 
however, if we're looking to fine-tune the replicator, we need to go to the Inspector. Let's  
take a look at the additional parameters available.
Getting ready
In the exercise folder of this chapter, double-click on the 08_02 project. Play back  
the project. If you've worked on the previous exercise, you'll see it's where we finished  
tweaking our replicator in the HUD.
How to do it...
1.	 Select Replicator in the Layers tab. Press the F4 key to open the Emitter tab of the 
Inspector. In the Cell Controls add an Angle Randomness value of 90. Each star 
now starts from a different angle position.
2.	 Change the value of Color Mode to Over Pattern.
3.	 Under the Gradient Presets menu to the right-hand side of Color Gradient, change it 
to Rainbow as indicated in the following screenshot:
4.	 Change the value of Color Repetitions to 20 and the Scale End to 20. Notice how 
the gradient wraps around the stars and how the stars start at 100 and get smaller 
as you move clockwise around the circle.
www.it-ebooks.info

Replicators – It's No Fun By Yourself
262
5.	 As a final step, change the value of Build Style to Counter Clockwise and scrub the 
offset value to see how you can change the position of where the first star begins. 
When you're done, change the value of Offset to 80%.
There's more...
Like emitters, you can use your own custom shape as a source to spread out the image you're 
replicating in that pattern. For example, if you change the shape of your replicators to Image 
and use Text as the source, the replicator will spell out the word if a substantial amount of 
points are made, the stars are small enough, and the value of Arrangement is set to Random 
Fill. See the following screenshot for reference:

Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_03 project. The project consists 
of a bokeh.png file from Motion's Library that has been replicated on a line. We're going to 
add a Sequence Replicator behavior to animate the circles onscreen.
www.it-ebooks.info

How to do it...
1.	 Select the replicator and press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Under Behaviors 
navigate to Replicator | Sequence Replicator, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Choose Apply. If you play back the project, you'll notice that nothing has changed. 
We'll need to add properties in the Behaviors tab of the Inspector to animate it.
2.	 Press the F2 key to move to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Add the Scale and 
Rotation parameters. Change the value of Scale to 0 and Rotation to 360. Play back 
the project. The circles start at their original size value and scale down to 0 while 
rotating 360 degrees over the length of the project.
3.	 Change the value of Sequencing from From to To, the Traversal to Ease In/Out, and 
the Spread to 20.

As we've seen in earlier chapters, we can do some pretty amazing things combining keyframes 
and behaviors. Let's see how we can combine both keyframes and behaviors when working 
with replicators.
www.it-ebooks.info

Replicators – It's No Fun By Yourself
266
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_04 project. Play back the project. 
The animation consists of a series of books that animate from offscreen to onscreen. If you 
select the replicator and go to the Replicator tab of the Inspector, you can see that they are 
being replicated along the shape of a line; however, because the line is so small, the books are 
overlapping. If you click on the Behaviors tab, you'll see a Sequence Replicator added. Three 
parameters have been added: Rotation, Color, and Position. Over the span of 2 seconds, the 
books go from the parameter values set in the Sequence Replicator to values established in 
the Replicator tab.
How to do it...
We're going to keyframe the line's length in the Inspector so that it grows out while the  
books animate.
1.	 Select the replicator and press the F4 key to go to the Replicator tab of the 
Inspector. Move to the 1 second point in the mini-Timeline and add a keyframe  
to Start Point and End Point as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Move to 2 seconds. Change the X value of Start Point to 600 and the X value End 
Point to -600. Play back the project and compare it with the following screenshot. 
The books now fall onto a line that grows from 1 to 2 seconds. Let's also have the 
books change scale over time.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8
267
3.	 Move to 1 second and in the Replicator tab under Replicator Controls add a 
keyframe next to Scale. Move to 2 seconds and change the value of Scale to 60%.
4.	 On the lower-right corner of the Timeline, click on the Show Keyframe Editor icon. 
Make sure that the Animated keyframes are displayed and the replicator is selected 
as shown in the following screenshot. Drag a marquee around all the keyframes in 
the graph. Ctrl + click any one of them and choose Ease Both. Play back the project 
and notice the change to the books' Scale from 1 to 2 seconds.

When you start building complex replicator animations, keep in mind that you can save 
them, as well as any of the behaviors you tweak, to the Library. The more time you spend 
automating your work, the more time you can dedicate to the creative process!

Working with replicator presets
So far, we've created our own replicators by selecting objects to place into cells referenced 
by the replicator. Motion ships with over 200 replicator presets! One of the best ways to learn 
Motion is to dissect how some of the replicators were created. Some of the elements can be 
even used to create transitions between elements. Let's take a look at what it has to offer!
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_05 project. There are two 
replicator presets in this project but one has been turned off. Play back the project and 
familiarize yourself with the animation and then stop the playback. If you select the replicator 
in the Squares group and look in the Replicator tab of the Inspector, notice that a series of 
rounded orange rectangles replicate in a rectangle shape. By changing the cell controls, the 
rounded replicated rectangles all have different scales. The blinking was made possible from 
the Sequence Replicator behavior that we can view in the Behaviors tab.
How to do it...
We're going to change a few of the parameters to see how we can customize this preset. If you 
haven't already done so, click on the disclosure triangle for the Squares group and select the 
Blink group.
1.	 Press the F4 key to go to the Replicator tab of the Inspector. Under the Cell 
Controls, change the value of Angle to 45 and the Angle Randomness to 90.

2.	 Go to the Behaviors tab and, under the Sequence Replicator, change the value of 
Spread to 12, the Traversal to Ease In / Ease Out, and the Loops to 40. Play back 
the project and compare it with the following screenshot. Notice how many more 
squares are being affected because of the spread increase and how often the  
blinks occur now.
www.it-ebooks.info

Replicators – It's No Fun By Yourself

3.	 Let's focus our attention on the other preset that's been turned off in this project. 
Turn off the Squares group and turn on the Lines group in the Layers tab. Play 
back the animation and notice it's a graph being written onscreen. Believe it or not, 
those are circles that are being replicated across a custom geometric shape whose 
animation is being controlled by the Sequence Replicator. Open the group and select 
the Replicator. Move your playhead to 3 seconds. Go to the Inspector and look at 
the various parameter settings under the replicator. Decrease the value of Points 
under Replicator Controls to 15 to see the circles being generated as shown in the 
following screenshot. Play back the project.
4.	 Increase the value of Points back to 200. Under Cell Controls, change the value of 
Scale End to 50.

Under the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_06 project. Play back the 
project. Inside the project, there is a Replicator of leaves being animated onscreen in the 
shape of a rectangle. Go to the Replicator tab in the Inspector to see that the value Origin is 
set to Lower Left and of the Build Style is set to By Column. These two parameters control 
the way the sequence replicator animates onscreen. Click on the Behaviors tab and then click 
on the disclosure triangle next to Position. Notice that the Z value is set to -4000. In previous 
recipes, it was mentioned that Z refers to depth in a project. Let's see how this is affected the 
instant we make our replicator 3D.

Adding a camera to interact with your 
replicator
Adding a camera to our project and having it interact with a replicator adds even more creative 
possibilities in Motion. Let's take a look at how we can make replicators and cameras play 
nicely with each other by adding our own camera to a project.
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 08_07 project. Play back the 
project. You should see a grid of animated rounded rectangles that changes size, color, and 
scale over time because of the sequence replicator. We're going to add a camera to the scene 
and a behavior to that camera to have it interact with our replicator.
How to do it...
Let's begin by adding a camera to the scene.
1.	 Make sure you are on the first frame of your project. Go to the Object menu  
and choose New Camera. A dialogue box will appear asking if you want to keep  
the groups as 2D or switch them to 3D. Choose Switch to 3D as shown in the 
following screenshot:
2.	 We're going to add a behavior to the camera to have it rotate around the Loft 
Replicator. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Under Behaviors, go to Camera 
| Sweep. Select the Sweep behavior and drag it onto the Camera in the Layers tab. 
By default, the behavior matches the length of your camera, which is the length of 
the project. Move to 5 seconds and trim the behavior's out-point by selecting it and 
pressing O in the mini-Timeline.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8
275
3.	 Press the F7 key to show the HUD. Change the value of Start of the Sweep  
Behavior to -180 and the end to 180. Set the value of Speed to Ease Out.  
Play back the animation.
4.	 The Camera rotates around the rectangles but we can clearly see they are flat. We're 
going to change that by having them always face the camera. Select the replicator 
and press the F4 key. Under the Replicator tab in the Inspector click on the 3D 
checkbox and the Face Camera checkbox as shown in the following screenshot.  
Play back the animation. The squares always turn to face the camera.

Getting ready
Locate a collection of around 80 to 100 photos on your hard drive or locate a few video clips. 
If you choose photos, it's best if these photos aren't extremely large in size because we will be 
displaying several of them on the screen at once. For optimum results, make sure every photo 
is 320 by 180 pixels. Feel free to use your favorite photo-editing application to scale them 
down. We want Motion to see these photos as an image sequence, and to do that, we'll need 
to give them the same name followed by a numerical number. The numbers assigned should 
be sequential. For example, if you have a set of photos with buildings, you'll call the first photo 
as building_1, the second as building_2, and so on.
Alternatively, if you have video clips, create a Motion project and lay the clips out sequentially 
in the Timeline. Export it out of Motion via the Share menu and choose Image Sequence.
Once you are finished, launch Motion and choose a project with a Duration of 7 seconds, 
a Preset of 720p, and a Frame Rate of 30 fps. When we go to the File Browser and find 
the image sequence, Motion will display only one file containing all the photos as long as 
the Collapsed Image Sequence option is active. For this project, it's best that you set the 
resolution to a quarter and the quality to draft until final export.

Faking 3D extrusion with shapes
Motion 5 doesn't make 3D objects. For that, you would need to go to a dedicated 3D 
application such as Cinema 4D and Maya. What Motion does allow is for us to fake 3D. As 
we saw when working with particles and even replicators, a number of camera tricks can be 
employed so that our object never appears flat.
Getting ready
From the exercise folder of this chapter, double-click on the 08_09 project file. The project 
consists of a diamond. We're going to replicate it and spread it out in a line on the Z axis, 
making it seem that, when we rotate around it, the object has depth.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the diamond and navigate to Object | Replicate.
2.	 Press the F4 key to go to the Replicator tab of the Inspector. Change the value of 
Shape from Rectangle to Line.
3.	 The diamonds overlap on a line spread out from left to right. We want it to spread out 
in Z space and for the diamonds to be close together. Click on the 3D checkbox.

Introduction
Motion 5 has the ability to help us analyze the Motion in a clip using a series of behaviors 
located in the motion tracking category. We may need to use motion tracking behaviors for a 
variety of reasons, such as when stabilizing a shaky shot. You may also want to use the data 
from an analysis so that you can apply it to another layer in your project and make it seem as 
if it was filmed at the same time. It could be a sign you want to replace from a billboard or text 
that you want to mimic the movement of someone walking. Whatever reason you need to use 
it, the motion tracker can help us perform difficult tasks without the need to rotoscope.
www.it-ebooks.info

Motion Tracking and Keying
284
In addition to having the ability to track single or multiple points, Motion 5 has a powerful 
keyer that we can use for green screen shots. The keyer is shared with FCP X and has an array 
of automated and manual correction parameters that make it ideal for most green screen 
footage. Using both the motion tracker and keyer together puts a vey powerful workflow at 
your fingertips.
Stabilizing a clip
Sometimes in the fast-paced world, production of pivotal shots may suffer a bit of shakiness 
that you want to smooth out in order to show it in your final work. The Stabilize behavior is all 
you need to make that happen.
Getting ready
Find a piece of footage that has a relative amount of shakiness in it. While Motion 5 can  
also work with clips with extreme amounts of shakiness, part of its solution is to scale up 
your clip to compensate. The more shaken the clip, the more scaling will take place. Create a 
new project based on the Frame Size, Frame Rate, and length of your clip. Import the clip into 
Motion using the File Browser or File | Import command.
How to do it...
Let's add the Stabilize behavior to our clip.
1.	 Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of your project. Select the clip in the 
Layers tab. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Go to Behaviors | Motion 
Tracking | Stabilize as shown in the following screenshot. Click on Apply at the  
top of the Library. The behavior is added to the clip.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
285
2.	 Make sure the Stabilize behavior is selected and press F7 to bring up the HUD. 
Notice that the Source currently shows the clip you added the behavior to. We 
need to choose what we want the Stabilize behavior to adjust; Position is currently 
selected. Click on Scale Smooth and Rotation Smooth and notice that they turn 
blue, indicating they're active as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Motion Tracking and Keying
286
3.	 If you're trying to preserve the motion in your selected clip, change the value of 
Method from Stabilize to Smooth. If you're trying to lock down a shot, keep it at 
Stabilize. Click on Analyze. Motion will analyze all the movements in your shot  
based on the settings you entered, as indicated in the following screenshot:
4.	 Once Motion has finished analyzing, playback the project. You should see that your 
shot is smoother but you may see the borders of your clip showing. This is because 
Motion has adjusted your clip's rotation and position frame-by-frame to stabilize it. To 
compensate, we need to zoom in on the image. For this, change the value of Borders 
from Normal to Zoom.
There's more…
Stabilization is usually your first line of defense before you perform a match move, as we'll 
see in an upcoming recipe. Motion tracking is easier to accomplish when the footage you are 
tracking has been stabilized.

Analyze and Match Move
In the last recipe, Motion analyzed the clip for us and decided on the best method to stabilize 
a clip based on the properties we wanted to adjust. With the Analyze behavior, we choose our 
own point or points to track and Motion attempts to follow them through the duration of the 
project. We'll then take the information from our tracking points and apply the data to a match 
move behavior that's attached to a text element, so that it mimics the movement of the point 
we tracked.
Getting ready
Under the Chapter 9 exercise files double-click the 09_02 project. Playback the project. It's 
a series of balls that fall from the sky and bounce on the table in slow motion. We're going to 
analyze a few of the balls' movement as they fall and bounce on the ground.
How to do it...
Let's add a behavior to our clip to analyze the movement.
1.	 Select the video clip. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Go to Behaviors | 
Motion Tracking | Analyze Motion. Click on Apply at the top of the Library. The 
behavior is added to the clip.
2.	 Make sure the behavior is selected in the Layers tab and press F7 to bring up the 
HUD. Go to the beginning of your project. By default, the Analyze Motion behavior 
gives us one tracking point. Grab the point and drag it across the screen and attach 
it to the lower part of the green ball on its right edge. Notice that, when you drag, the 
track point zooms in on the location you're under so you can clearly see where you're 
adding the point.
www.it-ebooks.info

Motion Tracking and Keying
288
Click on Analyze in the HUD as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Use the left and right arrow keys to move frame-by-frame throughout the project and 
follow the points with your eye. If the analysis was successful, you should see a series 
of dots connected by a red line showing you the balls' movement as displayed in the 
following screenshot. If it wasn't successful, Motion may showcase to you a red X. If 
this is the case, go back to the beginning of the project. Drag the tracker to a new 
point and click on Analyze again.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
289
4.	 Let's apply the tracking data to some text. Press T to select the text tool and type 
Green in the Canvas. Press the Esc key to exit text entry mode. Choose a green color 
of your liking. Go to the Library and then to Behaviors | Motion Tracking | Match 
Move. Click on Apply at the top of the Library. The behavior is added to the text.
5.	 Select the Analyze Motion behavior on the clip and drag it over the Match Move 
behavior on the text. Wait for the hooked arrow and release the mouse.
6.	 Select the Match Move behavior and in the HUD add Scale and Rotation to the 
Adjust field by clicking on them. The boxes will turn blue. Playback the project to see 
how the text now follows the ball.
7.	
Reposition the text to where you'd like it on the screen. Use the following screenshot 
for reference:

There's more...
If you Option + click when you drag your tracker, Motion tries to give you a series of points it 
thinks would be good to track. Simply align your tracker with the recommended point and let 
Motion analyze as shown in the following screenshot. Keep in mind, though, that its tracking 
recommendations are based on that frame only!

Offset tracking
Unlike the last recipe, sometimes the point you want to track isn't so easy. In fact, the point 
you need might become obscured by an object in the foreground for a series of frames or 
even end up going offscreen. For this, the Analyze Motion behavior gives us an option to 
offset our tracker with the click of a button.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
291
Getting ready
Under the exercise files relating to this chapter, double-click on the 09_03 project. Playback 
the project and notice it's where we left off in the last recipe. Now we would like to analyze 
another ball's movement in the clip and attach some text to it as well.
How to do it...
We'll begin this recipe by analyzing some motion in our image first.
1.	 Select the video clip in the Layers tab. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Go 
to Behaviors | Motion Tracking | Analyze Motion. Click on Apply at the top of the 
Library. The behavior is added to the clip.
2.	 Rename the new behavior orange analyze. Rename the other to green analyze.
3.	 Make sure the Analyze Motion behavior is selected and press F7 to bring up the 
HUD. Go to frame 19 of your project. Grab the point and drag it across the screen. 
Attach it to the lower part of the orange ball on the top-middle edge of the screen. 
It's best to try and find a point of high contrast. The specular on the upper-right side 
seems like a good candidate. Use the following screenshot for reference. Click on 
Analyze in the HUD once you've found your point.
www.it-ebooks.info

Motion Tracking and Keying
292
4.	 You may notice an X icon appear, indicating that at some point Motion lost the 
tracking point as shown in the following screenshot. We need to find the frame with 
the last good tracking point. Press the left arrow key to move back in your project 
frame-by frame. You'll notice after just 3 seconds that a white ball obscures the 
tracking point. Move to 3 seconds and 9 frames just before this occurs.
5.	 In the HUD, click on the square next to Offset Track to add a checkmark as shown in 
the following screenshot. Move the tracker to a point on the left side of the ball where 
it won't get obscured by the white ball (try the upper-left side of the other specular). 
Click on Analyze.
6.	 Motion writes over the previous points. Select the GREEN text and press  
Command + D to duplicate it. Change the duplicate text onscreen to orange  
and move it close to the orange ball.
7.	
Select the orange analyze motion behavior on the clip and drag it over the Match 
Move behavior on the Orange text. Wait for the hooked arrow and release the 
mouse. Playback the project and reposition the text as necessary. Use the following 
screenshot for reference:

Match Move Four Corner
Replacing a billboard is a common task in motion tracking. Let's see how we can use the 
Match Move behavior to track the four points of a sign and replace it with another element.
Getting ready
Under this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 09_04 project. Playback the project. 
The animation consists of a family walking to a For Sale sign. We want to replace this with a 
For Rent sign (this is a still image layer that's been temporarily turned off in the project). To 
achieve this, we'll apply a Math Move behavior to the still image and select the Four Corner 
tracking as the type.
www.it-ebooks.info

Motion Tracking and Keying
294
How to do it...
To attach For Rent to the sign, follow these steps:
1.	 Turn on the For Rent layer by clicking the empty box to the left in the Layers tab.
2.	 Select the video clip. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Go to Behaviors 
| Motion Tracking | Match Move. Click on Apply at the top of the Library. The 
behavior is added to the For Rent layer.
3.	 Make sure you're at the beginning of the project. Press F7 to reveal the HUD. With 
the Match Move behavior selected in the Layers tab, change the value of Track Type 
from Transformation to Four Corners. Four points are displayed in the Canvas.
4.	 Drag each point in the Canvas to its closest corner, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Try to find a point that's high in contrast. Once you've set all the  
points click on the Analyze button.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
295
5.	 Motion attempts to analyze the footage and fails along the way. Move back to the  
1 second mark. In the HUD, click on the Offset Tracking square and move the 
tracking points to the white marks on the frame of the sign. Click on the Analyze 
button again. Repeat these steps until you are satisfied with the track.
There's more...
Perfecting motion tracking can be a lengthy process. It's always good to attempt several 
different points until you get your desired result. Keep trying different points and offsets  
until you are satisfied!

Luma-keying a logo
Sometimes you may receive a logo from a client that has a white or black background 
embedded in it. What you would like to do is remove the background so that the logo appears 
as a lower third bug on your footage without a rectangular white/black box around it. Rather 
than going back to your client for a new logo, you may be able to extract the background using 
the Luma Key filter in Motion.
Getting ready
Find a piece of footage you would like to place a logo over. Launch Motion and create a  
new project based on your clip settings. Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of  
the project. Go to the File Browser, locate your clip and import it into the project. Find the  
LIFT_EXERCISE9_5_LOGO in this chapter's exercise folder. Notice, from the info panel at  
the top of the File Browser, that the logo is a JPEG that does not contain an alpha channel.  
We'll need to key this out with the Luma Keyer.
How to do it...
Let's add a Luma key to the logo:
1.	 With the logo selected in the File Browser, click on Import to bring it into the project. 
With the logo selected, press Command + 2 to go to the Library and choose Filters | 
Keying | Luma Keyer. Click on the Apply button.
2.	 Right now, Luma Keyer is trying to key-out the darker part of the image. Press F3 to 
go to the Filters tab and click on the empty box next to Invert. The filter now is trying 
to key-out the white part of the image.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9

3.	 Flip through the different types of views available including the Matte view to make 
sure you're not removing any of the logo. If you are, play with Luma Rolloff to adjust 
the key. Reveal the Matte and Light Wrap tools to see how you can manipulate  
the key.

Keying a green screen
It sounds simple in theory; place a subject in front of a green screen and, when you bring 
it into post with the click of a button, all the green is removed from the image. You can now 
place any background you want behind it. Unfortunately, rarely are green screens that simple. 
The color space of your camera, wrinkles in the screen, uneven lighting, and improper space 
between the subject and screen can all lead to problematic keys where several passes may be 
necessary in order to remove the color. Whether you have an amazing green screen or a bit of 
a puzzle to solve, Motion is here to help. It shares its Keyer with FCP X.
Getting ready
Find a piece of green screen footage on your system. Launch Motion and create a new project 
based on your clip settings. Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of the project. Go to 
the File Browser and find your footage. Click on the Import button to bring it into your project.
How to do it...
Let's add a filter to key out the green.
1.	 Select the green screen clip in the Layers tab and press Command + 2 to go to  
the Library.
2.	 Go to Filters | Keying | Keyer. Drag the Keyer to the green screen clip in your Layers 
tab. Press F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector.
3.	 Just like Luma Keyer, there are different ways we can view our selection. Click on 
the middle button in the View area (the white button) to reveal the Matte, as shown 
in the following screenshot. In this Canvas, white represents what you want to keep 
and black represents what you want to remove. Motion has attempted to apply some 
default settings to key-out the green. If they seem to work well, you can leave them as 
is and look at refining the Matte.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
299
4.	 Still in Matte mode, drag up the Fill Holes parameter if your subject has areas of 
soft transparency (that is, any area that's semi-grey or even black that you want to 
appear). Stop when the area is white.
5.	 Click on the disclosure triangle next to Matte Tools. Play with the Shrink/Expand, 
Soften, and Erode Effects to see what they do.
6.	 If you have a magenta hue around the edges of your subject, play with the Spill 
Suppression parameters to neutralize the color.
How it works...
Working with color in Motion and most graphic applications is an additive process. This means 
we add colors to end up at white. When we key a green screen, the system works so hard to 
key out green that sometimes it introduces its complementary color, magenta. To get rid of 
this spill suppression, we reintroduce a bit of green into the image in order to neutralize it.  
The Mac OS color wheel is a great way to see how color is laid out. This works great on color  
casts too.

In the last recipe, Motion did a lot of the initial work for us. In this recipe, we'll select our own 
key color to remove the green and fine-tune the edges in the image. From there, we'll refine 
the key and look at some additional ways we can add, take away, and refine our selection.
Getting ready
Find a piece of green screen footage on your system as well as a file that you'd like to use as a 
background. Launch Motion and create a new project based on your clip settings. Make sure 
your playhead is at the beginning of the project. Go to the File Browser and find your footage. 
Click on the Import button to bring both files into your project.
How to do it...
Let's start by adding a Keyer to our clip like the last recipe.
1.	 Select the green screen clip in the Layers tab and press Command + 2 to go to  
the Library.
2.	 Go to Filters | Keying | Keyer. Drag the Keyer to the green screen clip in your Layers 
tab. Press F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector.
3.	 The Strength slider is what controls the initial green selected from the Keyer. To 
make your own selection, set the Strength amount to 0 as shown in the following 
screenshot. All the green returns to the image.

4.	 Switch the View to Matte. Click on the Sample Color button. In your Canvas, drag 
out a rectangle around a small section of the green screen area. In you're unsure of 
where to start, try somewhere close to the subject. If you need to sample more green 
colors, hold down the Shift key and draw out another rectangular selection in the 
Canvas. Use the following screenshot for reference.
5.	 Click on the Edges button. Draw a line extending from you subject's hairline to the 
black area that's now transparent. What you're trying to do is define the area of semi 
transparency. Drag the middle line back and forth to adjust the selections.
6.	 Change the value of View back to Composite. Play with the Fill Holes, Edge 
Distance, and Spill Suppression parameters as required.
7.	
Open the Color Selection settings by clicking on the disclosure triangle. You have 
two options here: Scrub Boxes and Manual. If you wanted to, you could bypass 
the Refine Key section and select your chrominance and edge values. In the Scrub 
Boxes tab, the adjustments we make here affect our edge selection. Play with the 
Chroma wheel and the other parameters to see the effect it has on the edges of your 
selection. Click back and forth between Matte and Composite mode to get a sense 
for the changes from both views.
8.	 Click the disclosure triangle next to Matte Tools and Light Wrap. These settings allow 
you to adjust your selection even further. Play with the parameters under Matte Tools 
and notice the effect it has on your image. Do the same with Light Wrap, paying close 
attention to how the edges try to blend in with the background image.

There's more...
If your subject stays near the center of the image, you may want to create a mask around your 
image to remove unwanted areas and focus on the green closer to your main subject. This will 
create less work for you at the end and is commonly referred to as creating a garbage matte.

The Pleasantville effect
The use of color can have a strong impact on your audience. Some films such as Schindler's 
List and Pleasantville use the impact of color in stylistic ways. The effect is focused on having 
only one color within the image while everything else becomes desaturated. As in our previous 
keying recipes, to accomplish this we'll need to make a selection in our image based on color. 
By using masks and filters, we'll create one selection for everything we want to turn black and 
white, and another for the colors we want to keep.
Getting ready
Locate a video clip on your computer, preferably one with a strong vivid/saturated color  
you want to keep and to which you want to draw the viewer's attention. Launch Motion and 
create a new project based on your clip settings. Make sure your playhead is at the beginning 
of the project. Go to the File Browser and find your footage. Click the Import button to bring  
the file into your project
How to do it...
Let's add a Keyer to our clip like the last recipe.
1.	 Select the clip in the Layers tab and press Command + 2 to go to the Library.
2.	 Go to Filters | Keying | Keyer. Drag the Keyer to the clip in your Layers tab.  
Press F3 to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector.
3.	 The Strength slider controls the initial green selected from the Keyer. To make your 
own selection, set the Strength amount to 0.
4.	 Switch the View to Matte. Click on the Sample Color button. In your Canvas, drag  
out a rectangle around the color you want to keep. If you need to sample more of  
the same color, hold down the Shift key and draw out another rectangular selection  
in the Canvas.

Turning on Depth of Field
Introduction
A videographer would never be able to capture his incredible footage without the aid of a 
camera and the same is true with Motion. If you think you've seen a lot with Motion so far, 
think again because we've just scratched the surface. By making our projects 3D, we're about 
to bring an extraordinary dimension to our fingertips. This dimension will give us the ability 
to add cameras and lights to our scenes that will interact with any 3D object. Through this 
chapter, we'll begin to explore the basics so that we become more comfortable navigating 
around our 3D world. From there, we'll begin to animate our scenes by using behaviors and 
keyframes along with exploring some new effects that become possible only in 3D, such as 
Reflection and Depth of Field. Let's take a plunge into the abyss!

Intro to 3D

Making it 3D
Making a layer or group 3D is literally done with the click of a button. Seeing all the options 
that become available once you click that button requires a bit of trial and error. Let's hop on 
the fast track to turn our layers into 3D with a camera.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_01 project. The project consists of two 
groups and a light. One group contains a rectangle that has been rotated and acts as our floor. 
The other group contains four rounded rectangles that are positioned in x and z space, so 
that one appears closer than the other while slightly overlapping. Click the checkmark next to 
the light to see that it has no effect on our groups. In order for it to interact with our projects, 
the groups need to be 3D. Click on the Render menu above the Canvas to see that both 
Reflections and Shadows are currently turned on; once again, though, it doesn't appear as if 
there are any effects of it showing in the scene.
How to do it...
Let's add a camera to our project:
1.	 Under the Object menu, choose New Camera. You'll be presented with a dialog box 
that asks you if you'd like to turn your 2D groups to 3D, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Choose Switch to 3D:
2.	 Wow! A lot of stuff just happened. The minute you chose to switch your groups to 
3D, your floor started to reflect the rounded rectangles and the overall luminance of 
the scene went down since a light (spotlight) is now controlling it. On top of this, an 
icon on the two groups in the Layers tab changed and a series of camera controls 
appeared in the Canvas. On the Floor_1 group in the Layers tab, click the icon that 
looks like a stack of three rectangles, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice 
how it flattens. Once it does, the reflections go away and the group doesn't interact 
with the spotlight. That's because you made it 2D. This brings us to one of the most 
important rules when we work in 3D. 2D groups do not interact with cameras and 
lights. Only 3D groups do. Click the icon again to change it to 3D.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
307
3.	 Select the Light layer in the Layers tab and press F4 or Fn + F4 to go to the Light 
properties in the Inspector. Increase the Intensity property of Light to 600. Currently, 
the light is set to spotlight, much as you'd see in a theatrical show. That spotlight has 
been placed above our layers. We'll see in some of the later recipes how we'll be able 
to see the light from a different type of view.
4.	 To the upper-right of the Canvas, click and select the first camera control called Pan 
Camera. Notice how, when you hold down your mouse and scroll, you pan across your 
scene left, right, up, and down. Once you're done panning, double-click the control to 
reset it.
5.	 Click and select the second control. Notice that, when you scroll, it allows you to 
rotate around the scene. Once you're done, double-click the control to reset it.
6.	 Click, select, and scroll the third control called Dolly Camera and notice how it allows 
you to move in and out on the scene. Once again, double-click the control to reset 
your camera.
7.	
Select the Camera layer in the Layers tab and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of 
the Inspector. Click the disclosure triangle next to Position and Rotation to see the 
individual x, y, and z coordinates. Select each of the camera controls again and notice 
how the values of our camera change in the Inspector. You should see the following:


Pan Camera affects the X and Y position.


Orbit Camera affects the X, Y, and Z rotation


Dolly Camera affects the Z position
How it works
We explored rotation in earlier chapters but it's worth explaining further how rotation works 
because it's the foundation of how we'll orbit in 3D space.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
308
X Rotation
First of all, what is the X Position in Motion? X Position is left and right. Now how would you 
you rotate around this? Picture a pizza roller that's used to flatten dough. The pizza roller 
rotates along the x axis.
   
Y Rotation
The Y Position in Motion is up and down. Now picture a cowboy with his rope as he twirls it in 
the air. Much as with a flag on a pole, the rope rotates on the y axis.
Z Rotation
You may be unfamiliar with the Z Position if you come from a background having experience 
in an editing application such as FCP X. The Z Position refers to depth in your project. If I were 
to show you arrows, they would appear as a dot because it would be pointing away from us. 
Now picture holding a TV converter straight out in front of you with your arm fully extended. If 
you were to rotate it along the z axis, you may be surprised to find it's very familiar to how the 
hands of a clock rotate; in a circular type fashion. This is the one and only rotation available to 
us in FCP X.

Moving a camera versus moving a layer
In the last recipe, we learned how to make a group 3D with a camera. We also looked at how 
we could move our camera in 3D space using our camera controls situated above the Canvas. 
In this recipe, we're going to explore moving our camera and our layers in the HUD.
Getting ready
While this book is designed as a cookbook where you can start up from any recipe, if you are 
new to 3D I highly recommend breezing over the last recipe to help build up your knowledge. 
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_02 project. It's the same project we left 
off with from the previous recipe. It consists of a floor and four rounded rectangles above the 
floor, casting reflections based on the render settings. There is also a light and a camera in 
our scene. We're going to move around our camera using the HUD controls and also see how 
we can move our layers in the same way.
How to do it...
Let's start by moving our camera in the HUD:
1.	 Select Camera from the Layers tab. Press F7 to show the HUD. Press F1 to open the 
Properties tab of the Inspector. The reason we are displaying both the Properties tab 
and the HUD is to see what happens to our Position and Rotation values once we 
play around with the camera icons at the bottom of the HUD.
2.	 Notice that the Camera value is currently set to Framing. Think of Framing as a 
camera that wants to stay fixated on your scene. Right now, the camera is framing 
the floor and rectangles. So, rather than the camera rotating around its own body, it 
will rotate around the scene you're currently looking at. To visualize this even further, 
think of yourself as the cameraman framing these layers. If these rectangles and floor 
were the main attraction, you would never move you camera off the action no matter 
where you yourself moved. Also, there is a set of camera controls at the bottom of  
the HUD, as shown in the following screenshot. Select the first Move control on the 
left and scrub your mouse forward and backward. Notice how you dolly forward  
and backward in your scene. See how the Z position in the Properties tab of the 
Inspector becomes affected every time you scrub. Release your mouse and press 
Command + Z a few times until your camera's Position is set to [0,0,0].
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
310
3.	 Select the second Move control and notice how you pan around the scene, moving 
your camera's position along the x and y axis. Repeat this step for the third Move 
control and notice how it affects both the X and Z position. Rather than use 
Command + Z, click the hooked arrow at the top of the window to reset all the 
parameters of the camera, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 To rotate our camera, we're going to use the Properties tab instead of the HUD.  
The reason for doing so is that this will allow us to rotate our camera along each  
axis separately. Under X Rotation, click and scrub the value until you reach -8. Press 
Command + Z to undo. Under Y Rotation, scrub the value until -10. Undo the change. 
For Z Rotation, scrub the value till 20, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
311
5.	 Click the disclosure triangle for the Rectangles group in the Layers tab. Select the 
Green rectangle. Notice how the Canvas updates to show you the layer is selected 
with a set of arrows in the center of it, as shown in the following screenshot. Unlike 
cameras in our current view, we can move layers directly on screen. The arrows 
displayed are red, green, and blue, which represent position coordinates X, Y,  
and Z respectively.
6.	 You'll also see three circles. When you click on a circle, it will correspond to a type of 
rotation. Position your mouse over the circle to your right and notice whether clicking 
and dragging the circle affects its Z Rotation, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Press Command + Z to undo your change. Similar to position, the colors displayed 
(red, green, and blue) represent rotation coordinates X, Y, and Z respectively:
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
312
7.	
Click and select a few move controls in the HUD to experiment with changing the 
selected layer. Undo any changes you make by pressing Command + Z. Unlike the 
camera controls above the Canvas we used in the first recipe of this chapter, the HUD 
constantly changes what we affect based on what is selected in the Layers tab.  
The camera controls above the Canvas only affect the camera.
There's more...
We can also constrain the movement of our controls in the HUD. If you Command + click a 
camera control icon, you can minimize the movement or rotation to the direction you drag 
If you Shift + click while dragging a rotation handle in the Canvas, you will constrain your 
movement to 45-degree increments.

Where am I again? Controlling the view of 
your world using viewports
Motion 5 offers a lot of ways for you to navigate throughout a 3D environment using the 
different viewports available. With our viewports, we're able to see our world from a series  
of different perspectives. This allows us to better orient ourselves within the 3D space.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_03 project. It appears to be the same 
exercise from the last recipe, but with a few additions. There are two groups within the project. 
One contains the floor, a light, and the rectangles we're currently looking at. The other group 
contains the floor, a light, and the circles that are 4000 pixels to the left of our location. We 
can't see this other group because our camera is currently pointing at the first group. Click on 
the Scene 2 group and, in the Properties tab of the Inspector, verify its Position X. Click on 
Scene 1 and the Camera to verify their Position coordinates.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
313
How to do it...
Let's see how we can get an overall better sense of this project by looking at our project in 
different viewports:
1.	 At the upper-right of the Canvas is a rectangle icon next to the View menu. Click it 
and choose the third icon from the top (View | Horizontal), as shown here:
2.	 Your screen splits into two views. The top view currently displays the Active Camera 
view while the bottom view displays a different view of your world. Make sure the 
menu on the left-hand side of that view reads Top, as shown in the next screenshot.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
314
Once you make the change, notice the view being selected, which is indicated by a 
yellow box outlining it.
3.	 The Top view is one of several orthographic views. These views look directly down an 
axis, in this case y, to give us a set of different eyes on the scene. Open the content of 
the Scene 1 group and select the Rectangles layer. You should see it selected as a 
line in the Top view. If you don't see it, use the dolly camera and pan around controls 
in the active viewport to frame the group, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Notice how this has no effect on the Active Camera view.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
315
4.	 There is a compass on the lower-left hand side of the viewports. Click the red button 
to jump into the Right view. Select Camera in the Layers tab and notice how you're 
looking at it from the right-hand side, directly down the x axis, as indicated in the 
following screenshot. Once again, there is no change to the Active Camera view.
5.	 From the drop-down menu that currently has Right selected, choose Perspective. 
Unlike orthographic views that look down the x, y and z axis, Perspective view offers 
you a new set of eyes by also introducing some orientation. As a challenge, use the 
camera controls in the viewport to dolly out until you can see the second group. 
Use the pan camera tool as well, if you need to. Use the following screenshot for 
reference. Select Camera from the Layers tab to see where it's positioned:
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
316
6.	 With Camera still selected in the Layers tab, press F1 to go to the Properties tab. 
Scrub the X Position value to the left and watch both viewports update. You should 
see the camera moving towards the next scene. Stop scrubbing and enter -4000 for 
X. Use the following screenshot for reference:
How it works
If you ever select a view where your layers or groups are not well framed within the viewport, 
you can always try to frame or fit your object in the view by selecting it from the Camera View 
menu, as shown in the following screenshot. Just make sure the objects you want to frame are 
selected in the Layers tab!

The Adjust Around recipe.
Adjust Around
Adjust Around allows us to move objects from different perspectives. Let's say I tell you to 
walk left. You may come back and ask me: "Well, my left or your left?". With Motion, my left 
translates to the View access while your left would be Local access. Not to forget that we also 
both exist in a world with directions (that is, North, South, East, and West). Let's see how this 
can help our process as we move objects in 3D.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_04 project. The project consists  
of a group with some text, four circles, a floor, and a spotlight. The Canvas shows three 
viewports—our Active Camera view and two orthographic views from the Top and Right  
view. We're going to reposition each of our circles and text so that they are slightly angled 
toward the camera.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
318
How to do it...
While we make the above changes, we'll also use our Adjust Around pop-up menu to move 
the objects in different ways.
1.	 Reveal the content of the Circles group. Click the Text layer to select it in the Layers 
tab and Command + click each of the Circle layers to select it and see where they 
appear in the different viewports. Go to the Properties tab of the Inspector and 
single-click each object to see where it's located in 3D space. Use the following  
image for reference:
2.	 Select the Text layer again and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector 
if it's not already showing. Reveal the individual rotation properties and, for Rotation 
Y, type 45. Select Circle 4 in the Inspector and, for Rotation Y, type -45. For the 
remaining circles, type in the following co-ordinates:


Circle 3: Set Rotation Y to 45


Circle 2: Set Rotation Y to -45


Circle 1: Set Rotation Y to 45

Chapter 10
319
3.	 Select the Text layer and press F7 to bring up the HUD. At the very bottom of the 
HUD, make sure Adjust Around is set to Local Axis, as shown in the following 
screenshot. In the Top view, you should see a red and blue line attached to the floor 
(red = x and blue = z. Note that we can't see a green line because y is up and down 
and won't show on a floor). This is known as the 3D grid and is one of several 3D 
overlays that have been automatically turned on for you. This can be toggled on and 
off from the View menu above the Canvas.
4.	 Flip between Local Axis, World Axis, and View Axis and notice the following results 
in your Top view:


In Local Axis, the blue arrow points in front of the object


In World Axis, the blue arrow stays aligned with the blue line on the 3D grid


In View Axis, the blue arrow points straight at you

Intro to 3D

5.	 Drag the blue arrow in each of the Adjust Around axes and see what happens in the 
Active Camera view. Once you finish, press Command + Z to undo.
6.	 Try to use different Adjust Around options to reposition the order of the circles and 
see how they are spread out.
There's more...
The Adjust Around drop-down menu takes a little getting used to: Take your time when  
moving objects in 3D space. The more time you spend now, the less you'll have to worry  
about later on!

321
Integrating 3D and 2D
When working in 3D, sometimes you don't want elements to be affected by cameras so that 
the layer or group remains constant throughout your project. For example, you may want a 
background to remain the same for the duration of your project. One way to achieve that is by 
making your background 2D.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_05 project. The project consists of 
a gradient background and a PSD file with several layers. Click the disclosure triangle next 
to the Casa Loma group to reveal its content. There are several groups that have different 
z-axis positions. You can confirm this by selecting the groups and pressing F1 to reveal the 
Properties tab of the Inspector. Look at the Z Position co-ordinate and notice how each group 
has a different number. The reason for this is to ensure that, if we add any type of camera 
move, it will appear that there is some depth between each of the buildings as we move 
through the group. The goal of this recipe is to start with the gradient background and slowly 
dolly through the scene revealing each of the buildings. Press F6 to hide your Timeline. A 
camera has already been added to the scene.
How to do it...
Let's add a behavior to the camera and have it move through each of the buildings:
1.	 Press Command + 2 to go to the Library tab. Go to Behaviors | Camera | Dolly. 
Select the Dolly behavior and drag it to the camera in the Layers tab.
2.	 We want the camera to start in front of the buildings and slowly reveal them. To help 
us move the camera, above the Canvas on the upper-right select the rectangle icon 
and choose the third icon from the top to change to two up-horizontal views. Make 
sure the bottom view is set to Top and is selected. If you need to, zoom out to see the 
whole scene.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
322
Select the background, the Casa Loma group in the Layers tab, and the camera to 
see them in Top view, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Make sure only the camera is selected in the Layers tab. Use the blue arrow in the 
Top view to push your camera back until you can no longer see the entire background 
in the Active Camera view. Now click the icon to the right of the Background group to 
make it 2D, as shown in the following screenshot. Now the camera has no effect on 
it; it will be seen at all times.
4.	 With the camera still selected, press F4 to reveal the Camera tab of the Inspector.  
We want to fade in on each of the layers as we dolly through them. Set Near  
Plane to 400 and Near Fade to 600. Press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the 
Inspector. Make sure you're at the beginning of your project and change your 
camera's Z Position to -3700.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
323
5.	 Press F2 to go to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. Type in -3700 for the Distance 
field and set Speed to Ease Both.
6.	 Select the Active Camera view and press the Space bar to play back the animation.
There's more...
If you hold down the Command and Option keys while using the Move Z icon in the HUD, it will 
scale and reposition the layer. This will ensure the layer will appear the same to the camera, 
although now there will be Z Space between the various layers.

Using the Framing camera behavior
The Framing camera behavior is one of the strong indications where traditional  
keyframing would seem tedious in retrospect once you use it. All the Framing behavior  
needs is a source; the source can be a group or a layer. Once it has a source, the Framing 
behavior will fly to the source's position and frame it in the center of the screen. Let's see  
how we can use it to our advantage.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_06 project. Press the Space bar to play 
back the project. It consists of a clock where the hour and minute hands have been animated 
using Parameter behaviors. If you open up the content of the Full Clock group, notice how 
each of the groups contained within it has been spread out and scaled in Z Space. Notice how 
the content of the clock group have also been repositioned and scaled.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
324
How to do it...
We're going to use a series of Framing behaviors to zoom in and out of our clock.
1.	 If your Timeline is open, press F6 to close it. With the camera selected, go to the 
gear icon underneath the Canvas and choose Camera | Framing, as shown in the 
following screenshot. The behavior is now applied.
2.	 By default, the behavior is applied to the entire length of the camera. With Framing 
selected, move to the one-second mark in the mini-Timeline. Press I to trim the  
in-point to your playhead. Move to the three-second mark on the mini-Timeline  
and press O to trim the out-point to your playhead, as shown here:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
325
3.	 Let's say you want to fly to the TV group. Select the TV group and drag it over the 
Framing behavior in the Layers tab and, when you see the hooked arrow, release, 
your mouse. Select the behavior and press F7 to bring up the HUD. Set Transition to 
Ease Both. Play back the project. From one to three seconds, the camera flies into 
the TV, as shown in the in the following screenshot:
4.	 Let's say we want to zoom back up at the five-second mark. Move to 5 seconds. Select 
the Framing behavior and press Command + D to duplicate it. Press Shift + [ to move 
the in-point of the behavior to your playhead. Rename the first Framing behavior as 
Frame TV and the duplicate as Frame Full Clock. Drag the Full Clock group into 
the source well of the Frame Full Clock behavior. Play back the project.
5.	 Move to the nine-second mark. Select one of the Framing behaviors and press 
Command + D to duplicate it. Rename the duplicate Frame Work. Press Shift + [ 
to move the in-point of the behavior to your playhead. Drag the Work group into the 
source well of the Frame Work behavior. Play back the project.
How it works
You can change the way your camera travels by playing with the Framing behavior 
parameters. Try playing with some of the parameters under the Framing behavior  
to change the path and framing of the groups you want your camera to travel to.

Let's add some light
Lighting in Motion in any project can make all the difference. Use and animate lights to create 
complex animations for all your clients. Let's see a few of the light types available to use once 
we've made our groups 3D.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise folder, double-click the 10_07 project. Press the Space bar to 
play back the project. It's the same project from the last recipe including the Framing behavior 
moves we made. Make sure you have two horizontal viewports displayed. Set the upper 
view to Active Camera and the bottom view to Front. Reposition the scene as necessary in 
the Front view using the camera controls. We're going to change the lighting in our scene a 
bit. We're going to add three lights: an ambient light to illuminate the overall scene and two 
spotlights that we'll animate to turn on when we move in on the clock. Select the camera and 
each of its behaviors to familiarize yourself with the timing.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Object menu, choose New Light. A light is added to the scene that  
interacts with all the 3D groups and layers in your group. When you added the  
light, all the ambient light in the scene was turned off. We want to replace that  
with our own ambient light that is positioned back in Z Space so that we create  
a silhouette-type effect.
2.	 Select the light and press F7 to show the HUD. The default light type is Point. We can 
place it anywhere we want by changing its Position value and we control its brightness 
by adjusting the Intensity value. In the HUD, set Intensity to 45 and Falloff to 9. Press 
F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector and set the light's Z Position to -500. 
Use the following screenshot as a reference. The silhouette effect was made possible 
by separating the characters in Z Space from the back of the clock.

Chapter 10
327
3.	 Let's add two additional lights to our scene. From the Object menu, select New Light. 
In the HUD, set Light Type to Spotlight. Rename the light as Spot TV. With the light 
selected, press Command + D to duplicate it. Name the duplicate Spot Work.
www.it-ebooks.info

Intro to 3D
328
4.	 Select Spot TV and press F1 to go to the Properties tab of the Inspector. Enter 200, 
-125, -125 for its X, Y, and Z position respectively. For Rotation X, enter -10. Go to 
the Light tab in the Inspector and set Intensity to 80, Falloff to 2.5, and Soft Edge to 
11, as shown in the following screenshot. For the time being, turn off the Spot Work 
light by clicking the checkmark next to it in the Layers tab.
5.	 We're going to keyframe the Intensity value of the TV light so that it turns on as we 
zoom into the TV. Press F6 to show the Timeline. Move to the two-second mark. In 
the Light tab of the Inspector, click the diamond shape next to Intensity. Move to 
one second and change the Intensity value to 0. A keyframe is added automatically. 
Move to five seconds and click the diamond shape next to Intensity to lock the value 
at 80. Move to six seconds and change the Intensity value back to 0. Play back the 
animation. The light now fades in as the camera zooms on the TV and fades out 
when it leaves.

When you make your objects 3D, your objects have full interactivity with lights, including the 
option to cast and receive shadows. As long as you have Shadows enabled under the Render 
menu from the Properties tab, you can choose how shadows for the selected layer interact in 
your 3D project.

Creating reflections
In the last few recipes, you may have recognized that some of the objects had reflections 
turned on. Let's see how we can turn reflections on manually.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_08 project. Press the Space bar to play 
back the project. You may notice the project does not play in real time. You can try to adjust 
the quality and resolution temporarily to allow the project to play back faster. The project 
consists of a camera and a few lights interacting with a floor, background, and a text layer. 
One of the lights has been animated using a Parameter behavior to wriggle the Intensity 
value of the light. The text has been animated using a Sequence Text behavior that has been 
set to rotate each character along the y axis. We want to reflect our text on the floor. Before 
we enable text on the Floor layer, select the Reflection text and under the Properties tab of 
the Inspector make sure Casts Reflection is set to Yes. Also, check the Render menu to make 
sure there is a checkmark next to Reflections, as shown here:

How to do it...
Now we are ready to add a reflection to the floor:
1.	 Select the Floor layer in the Floor and Background group. Press F1 to go to the 
Properties tab. Click the empty square next to Reflection to activate it, as shown in 
the next screenshot. If needed, click on the word Show next to Reflection to see each 
of the parameters.
2.	 Set Reflectivity to 50 and Blur Amount to 6.
3.	 For a more fine-tuned adjustment, click the empty square next to Falloff. Click the 
disclosure triangle to reveal its properties.
4.	 Set Begin Distance to 100, End Distance to 350, and Exponent to 2. Use the

Turning on Depth of Field
Motion allows us to create some very realistic camera effects by enabling a property called 
Depth of Field. With it, we can choose an object we want to focus on by using its Z Position  
to guide us, in turn blurring other layers around it. Let's see how we can use it.
Getting ready
From this chapter's exercise files, double-click the 10_09 project. Press the Space bar to play 
back the project. You may notice the project does not play in real time. You can try to adjust 
the quality and resolution temporarily to allow the project to play back faster. The project 
consists of a camera and a few lights interacting with a floor and two text layers. Select each 
text layer and pay attention to its Z Position value in the Properties tab of the Inspector. We 
want to enable Depth of Field for our project, so that only the text in the foreground is in 
focus. We will then animate the focus by keyframing the Offset value.
How to do it...
Let's make sure our project is set up properly:
1.	 Under the Render menu, click the word Depth of Field to enable it for the project.  
You should notice that both the text layers have gone out of focus.
2.	 Select your camera and press F4 to go to the Camera tab of the Inspector. Twirl down 
the Depth of Field parameters by clicking the Show button, as shown here:
3.	 Set DOF Blur Amount to 80 and Near Focus to 1700.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
333
4.	 Move to the one-second mark and add a keyframe next to Focus Offset by clicking 
the diamond icon. Move to the two-second and change the Focus Offset value to 
1700. A keyframe is added automatically as shown here:
5.	 As a final step, set Filter from Gaussian to Defocus. It creates a more realistic blur. 
Keep in mind, it's render intensive!

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
336
Introduction
Motion 5 has made incredible leaps and bounds with its round-tripping process with FCP 
X. In previous versions of Final Cut Studio, users had the ability to send files to Motion and 
have any saved changes appear embedded in the Final Cut Pro Timeline. Users also had the 
ability to save templates that users could tweak directly in Final Cut Pro. The problem was that 
the changes you could make were limited, such as text, font, size, color, and drop zones. In 
Motion 5, users can create text, transitions, effects, and generators to be stored in the FCP X 
Media Browser. Also, not only does the user have the ability to create templates for the user 
to have access to, but also you have control over sending those parameters you choose to be 
available in Final Cut Pro X. It's like bringing in parts of Motion's architecture directly in to  
FCP X. This can help users automate their workflows in a variety of different project settings. 
Let's get deep under the hood of Final Cut X and Motion to gain a stronger understanding of 
how both applications play together.
Opening and changing text from FCP X in 
Motion
If you have FCP X and Motion running on your MAC, you may have noticed certain similarities 
between the two applications and their interfaces. When exploring FCP X, you might have 
right-clicked on a text file from the Media Browser and noticed an option to open it in Motion. 
Let's now walk through what happens when we do.
Getting ready
Go into your application folder and double-click on the Final Cut Pro icon to launch it. Press 
Command + 0 to go to the Project Library and from the File menu choose New Project. 
Name the project Text to Motion, associate it with any event you'd like, and click on OK.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Window menu, navigate to Media Browser | Titles as shown in the 
following screenshot. The Media Browser opens to the right-hand side of the 
Timeline showing all of the available text presets. We're going to find one  
and send a copy of it over to Motion.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
337
2.	 Under All Category, scrub over the Drifting text by hovering over it with your  
mouse. A preview of the text animation is displayed. Let's say you pretty much  
like the animation but would prefer to animate the text in the opposite direction.  
Ctrl + click the text and choose Open a copy in Motion. Motion launches and  
opens up a project entitled Drift Copy.
3.	 Press Command+ - to zoom out on your Canvas window a few times until it reads 
25%. Open up the group in the Layers tab by clicking on the disclosure triangle and 
select each of the text layers, paying attention to where keyframes lie along their 
Motion paths. Make sure your playhead is at the beginning of the project.
4.	 With the Title layer selected, press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab of the 
Inspector and change the Position X value to 1482.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
338
5.	 Press Shift + K to move to the next keyframe and set the Position X value to 74. 
Press Shift + K again and change the Position X value to -74. Press Shift + K again 
and change the Position X value to -1482. You should have now made changes to 
the four existing keyframes. Play back the animation. Notice how both text layers 
move in the same direction. Use the following screenshot for reference.
6.	 Select the Subtitle layer and move to the beginning of the project. In the Properties 
tab of the Inspector, enter -1586 for Position X.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
339
7.	
Press Shift + K to move to the next keyframe. Set the Position X value to -74. Press 
Shift + K again and change the Position X value to 74. Press Shift + K again and 
change the Position X value to 1586. Play back the animation.
8.	 We're now ready to send the text back over to Motion. Press Command + S to save 
the file. Press Command + Tab to go back over to FCP X on the dock. In the Media 
Browser, you should notice a new text template in the Media Browser called Drift 
Copy. Drag it into the Timeline, as shown in the following screenshot. Press Shift + Z 
to fit the text to your Timeline window and the Space bar to play back the animation. 
Notice how your changes have been carried over!
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
340
How it works...
You can choose to allow the user control over certain parameters from Motion in Final Cut. In 
FCP X, select the Drift Copy in your Timeline and press Command + 4 to go to the Inspector. 
Every parameter you see in the Title tab, someone chose to publish it over from Motion giving 
the FCP X user control of it. For instance, the Build In, Build Out checkboxes control the 
animation of your text at the beginning and the end. They were set up using a special type  
of marker in Motion, allowing the user an option to turn the animation on or off.
You should note that, when you create a title project in Motion, it gets added to FCP X's Media 
Browser automatically once you save.
There's more…
When you create an FCP title project in Motion and save it, it gets added to the Media 
Browser in FCP X under the Titles section. On top of this, you get a Text tab containing a 
majority of the options you have for working with text in Motion. See the following screenshot 
for reference:

Publishing a Motion 5 generator and its 
parameters to FCP X
If you've worked with some of the earlier chapters, you'll know that there are several 
generators available to you in Motion's Library. Some of them aren't available in FCP X.  
Let's add a generator and its parameters to FCP X by saving our project as a Final Cut  
Pro generator.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
342
Getting ready
Launch Motion. From the welcome screen, select a Final Cut generator project. Choose a 
project with a Preset of Broadcast HD 1080, a Frame Rate of 29.97, and a Duration of  
10 seconds. Click on Open. Motion's interface launches.
How to do it...
From here we'll add a generator to our Timeline and use the Inspector to choose the 
parameters we wish to publish.
1.	 Press Command + 2 to go to the Library. Navigate to Generators | Spirals. With 
Spirals selected and your playhead at the beginning of the project, click on Apply.
2.	 With the Canvas selected, press Shift + Z to fit it to the window. Select Spirals from the 
Layers tab and press the F4 key to go to the Generators tab of the Inspector.
3.	 The trick to publishing parameters to FCP X is to find them in the Inspector. Once you do, 
it's a matter of Ctrl + clicking on the appropriate word to publish. Ctrl + click on the word 
Width in the Generator tab and choose Publish as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
343
4.	 Click on the Project layer in the Layers tab. In the Project tab of the Inspector, 
you should see that Width appears under Published Parameters as shown in 
the following screenshot. Select the Spirals layer again in the Layers tab. In the 
Generator tab of the Inspector, Ctrl + click on the word Height and choose Publish.
5.	 Repeat the last step for every remaining parameter. When you get to Scale, you'll 
notice that the parameter is grayed out. Scale is associated with the Modern (linear) 
type of spiral. To publish it, select Modern (linear) from the Type menu and then 
publish it as with the other parameters.
6.	 Select the Project layer again and double-check that all the parameters are 
published in the Project tab of the Inspector. The Published Parameters section 
also represents the order in which the FCP X user will see each parameter, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
344
7.	
To get this over into Final Cut, navigate to the File menu and choose Save. We'll call 
the template Spirals.
8.	 You need to create a new category and theme in order to see this in FCP X. Under the 
Category menu choose New Category. Name it Generators.
9.	 Under Theme, choose New Theme and call it Motion 5 Generators. Make sure 
Make Preview Movie is selected and press Publish. Motion begins to save the file to 
FCP X as shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 When the process is complete, launch Final Cut. Create a new project and event if 
necessary. Navigate to Window | Media Browser | Generators. Find the Generators 
category on your left-hand side and notice the theme the Spirals generator is in. Drag 
Spirals to bring it into the project. Select it and press Command + 4 to bring up the 
Inspector. Verify that all the parameters you published are present. Use the following 
screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
345
There's more...
It's easy to change the order of the published parameters.
Changing the order of published parameters
In Motion, if you click on the word of any published parameter and hold your mouse, you can 
drag that parameter up or down to change its order and verify how it will be seen in FCP X.
If you ever need to transfer Motion files for FCP X to another computer, everything is contained 
in the Movies folder.

Finding Titles, Effects, Transitions, and Generators at the system 
level
Under your user Movies folder, there is a folder called Motion Templates that contains all the 
Effects, Generators, Titles, and Transitions that you publish over to Final Cut. If you want to 
install them on another system, find the category your items are in and copy that folder over to 
another system. Use the following screenshot for reference:

Creating an effect for FCP X
Almost all the effects in the FCP X library come from Motion 5. Let's create our own effect in 
Motion and bring it to FCP X with some parameters that we can tweak.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
347
Getting ready
Locate some video footage on your computer that you'd like to add an effect to and that is 
about 10 seconds in length. Launch Motion. From the welcome screen, select a Final Cut Effect 
project. From the Preset, choose a Broadcast HD 1080 project with a Frame Rate of 29.97 and 
a Duration of 10 seconds. Click on Open. Motion's interface launches. Make sure you are at the 
beginning of your project. Drag the footage from your File Browser over to the Effect Source 
well. When you see a hooked arrow, release the mouse. The placeholder now gets updated with 
your footage. Select the Canvas and press Shift + Z to fit the video to the window.
How to do it...
1.	 We're going to add three effects to this clip and then choose to publish the 
parameters we want the FCP X user to have access to. While the effects we will be 
using already exist in FCP, think of Motion allowing you the ability to save a preset 
where several effects in a row easily get added to the clips helping to automate your 
workflow in FCP X. Press Command + 2 to go to the Library and navigate to Filters | 
Distortion | Flop. Click-and-drag it over to the Effect Source well in the Layers tab.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
348
2.	 Under the Library in Filters, navigate to Stylize | Halftone. Click-and-drag it over 
the Effect Source well in the Layers tab. With Effect Source selected, press the F3 
key to go to the Filters tab of the Inspector. Change the value of Scale to 8 and the 
Contrast to 0.7.
3.	 Press Command + 2 to go back over to the Library. Under Filters navigate to Border 
| Simple Border. Click-and-drag it over to the Effect Source well in the Layers tab. 
Press the F3 key to jump back to the Filters tab and select a blue color and a width 
of your liking.
4.	 At this point, we could send the effect over to FCP X. The problem is, none of the 
parameters on the effects would be copied over. The user would only have the  
option to turn the effect on or off. To fix this, we'll publish each parameter. Start  
off by Ctrl + clicking on the word Width in the Filters tab and, from the menu that 
appears, choose Publish. Continue Ctrl + clicking on every parameter name until 
you've published every parameter.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
349
5.	 Click on the Project layer in the Layers tab. In the Project tab of the Inspector, you 
should see that the all the parameters appear under Published Parameters. Rename 
Width, Color, and Mix to Border Width, Border Color, and Border Mix. You 
can rename by double-clicking on the parameter you wish to rename. Double-check 
and make sure the mix value you rename is attached to the border.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
350
6.	 For all the parameters associated with Halftone, add the letter H in front of them. Add 
the word Flop in front of the Flop parameters as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
After you've verified that all the parameters work. Go to the File menu and choose 
Save. Call the template Border, Halftone, and Flop. Create a new theme and a 
new category of your liking. Click on Publish when finished. The next time you launch 
Final Cut, the effect will be within the Media Browser under Effects. You can add it to 
any clip on your Timeline.

There's more…
Unlike effects and transition projects, Final Cut generators can be saved from a Motion 
project. You can choose to create a generator project when you launch Motion or create a 
generator from any Motion project by navigating to File | Publish Template and then clicking 
on Publish as Final Cut Generator, as shown in the following screenshot:

Creating a transition for FCP X
Just as we can create effects to use in Final Cut Pro X, we can also create custom transitions. 
Transitions can be created using overlaying graphics and also by animating placeholders that 
will appear as soon as you launch a Motion transition project.
Getting ready
Locate two still images on your computer that you'd like to a transition between. Launch 
Motion. From the welcome screen, select a Final Cut transition project.
1.	 From the Preset, choose a Broadcast HD 1080 project with a Frame Rate of 29.97, 
and a Duration of 1 second. This represents how long we want the transition to be.
2.	 Click on Open. Motion's interface launches. Make sure you are at the beginning 
of your project. There are two transition sources in the project; Transition A and 
Transition B.
3.	 Drag your first still image to Transition A. When you see a hooked arrow, release the 
mouse. The Transition A placeholder now gets updated with your footage.
4.	 Repeat this for the second video clip and Transition B. Select the Canvas and press 
Shift + Z to fit the video to the window. Before we create our transition, there are two 
essential rules we need to know. First, Transition A should always be full-frame on 
the first frame of our project. Second, on the last frame, Transition B should be  
full-frame. Your animation will begin and end between these two points that we'll 
identify so that we can stretch out the duration of the transition in FCP X later on.
How to do it...
What we'd like to do is start with Transition A and move to Transition B, which is going to come 
onscreen from the right-hand side. To do this, we'll reposition the Transition B layer offscreen on 
the right-hand side and then we'll keyframe the group to move between the transitions.
1.	 Press Command + - to zoom out on the Canvas and select Transition B.  
Shift + drag the layer in the Canvas until it is offscreen to the right-hand  
side, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
353
2.	 Move to first frame 1 of the project. With Transition B still selected, press the I key  
to extend its in-point to frame 1. Select Transition B and move to frame 28. Press  
the O key to trim its out-point.
3.	 Move back to frame 1. Select the Group and press the F1 key to go to the Properties 
tab of the Inspector. Click on the diamond shape next to Position to add a keyframe. 
Move to the frame 28 and enter -1920 for the X value. A keyframe is added 
automatically. Use the following screenshot for reference:
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
354
4.	 Press Command + 8 to bring up the Keyframe Editor. Select the last two keyframes  
in the graph and Ctrl + click either one. From the menu, choose Ease In. Play back 
the animation.
5.	 Press Command + S to save the transition to Final Cut. Call the transition Left to 
Right. Create a new category called My Transitions and choose a new theme of 
your liking as shown in the following screenshot. Make sure Save Preview Movie is 
selected and choose Publish.
6.	 Launch Final Cut and, from the Window menu, go to Media Browser | Transitions. 
Verify that the transition is there and apply it to the edit point over any two clips or 
stills in your Timeline by clicking and dragging from the Media Browser to the edit 
point. Play around the transition point.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
355
How it works...
In FCP X's preferences, all transitions have a default length of 1 second. If you create a 
transition longer than the FCP X default length in Motion, you need to go into your Project 
Properties and click on the Override FCP option. With this option, if you had a 3-second 
transition, it would appear as 3 seconds in Final Cut and cannot be sped up to 1 second.

Publishing parameters versus publishing 
rigs 101 – part 1
While publishing parameters to FCP X gives us a lot of flexibility, publishing rigs gives us even 
more. A rig allows us to have control over several parameters at once while, at the same time, 
helping us to create a more simplified user interface for the FCP user. In this exercise, we'll 
explore some of the similarities and differences between publishing and rigging.
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 11_05 project. Play back the 
project. The project consists of four animated arrows that are interacting with lights and  
have a Colorize filter placed on the group they're in. If you look directly under the Project 
layer, you'll see a rig has already been created called Arrow Color. In the end, this rig is going 
to allow the FCP X user to choose between four colors for his arrows. Before we can do that, 
we'll have to add one additional snapshot to our rig and publish it over to Final Cut.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
356
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Arrow Color layer directly under Rig in the Layers tab and press the F4  
key to reveal the Widget tab of the Inspector. The type of rig that has been added  
to this project is a pop up. It allows the FCP X user to choose different settings from a 
pop-up menu; in this case, the color. Change the value of Arrow Color from Red to  
Green as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click-and-drag in between the Inspector and Layers tab until you can clearly see the 
name of the parameter with the color well set to green. This parameter is from the 
Colorize filter. We've told Motion that, when the pop-up menu displays green, the 
remap white parameter is set to green. Change the value of Arrow Color from Green 
to Purple. Notice how the color well changes to purple. We want to have access to 
one more color option in Final Cut before we publish our rig over.
3.	 Next to the Arrow Color pop-up menu, click on the plus icon to add a snapshot. 
Rename the snapshot as blue. Ctrl + click on the Color well and set it to a blue  
color. Flip between each of the different colors again to make sure each color is 
displayed appropriately.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
357
4.	 While the pop-up widget appears to be working fine, we need to publish the rig  
in order for the FCP X user to have access to it. Ctrl + click on the word Arrows  
Color and choose Publish. Select the Project layer and notice how the rig has  
been published over. Set the value of Arrows Color to Red. This will be the first  
color the user sees in FCP X.
5.	 We need to save this project as a template to have access to it in FCP X. From the  
File menu, choose Publish Template. Name the template Colored Arrows and 
click on the Publish as Final Cut Generator box. Create a new category and theme  
of your choice and select Publish. Use the following screenshot for reference:
6.	 Launch Final Cut Pro. Search your Media Browser under Generators and bring  
Color Arrows into a project. Look in the Inspector to see the pop-up widget. In the 
next exercise, we'll add another widget to our rig in order to control the amount of 
arrows we see.
How it works...
Please note, you can't publish a parameter that's controlled by a rig. In the last exercise, the 
Colorize filter's remap white parameter was controlled by the rig. It's important to note that 
rigged parameters can't be published. Essentially, when a parameter is being controlled by a 
rig, publishing that parameter will have no effect.

Publishing parameters versus publishing 
rigs 101 – part 2
In this exercise, we'll build on our exploration of rigging by creating our own rig and selecting 
parameters we want associated with it to control which arrows we see. We'll then publish that 
rig over to our existing Color Arrows Final Cut Pro generator.
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, double-click on the 11_06 project. Press the Space bar 
to play back the project. It consists of the same animated arrows from the past exercise. We'll 
create a new pop-up rig so that we only see one arrow appear at a time rather then all of them 
at once.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Arrow 1 layer. In order to control the visibility of arrows in Final Cut, we 
can use the opacity parameter. Press the F1 key to go to the Properties tab of the

2.	 In the Layers tab, a new pop up is added under the existing rig. In the Layers tab, 
rename the pop up to Arrow Choice. Select Arrow Choice and press the F4 key to 
go to the Widget tab of the Inspector.
3.	 We're going to add the opacity parameters of the remaining arrows and then link 
them to the appropriate snapshots. Select Arrow 2 and, if needed, press the F1 key 
to go to the Properties tab in the Inspector. Ctrl + click on the word Opacity and 
navigate to Add to Rig | Rig | Add to Arrow Choice.
4.	 Repeat the preceding step for Arrow 3 and Arrow 4.
5.	 Select Arrow Choice in the Layers tab and notice in the Widget tab that all four 
arrows' opacities appear. We must link them to the appropriate snapshots. Click on the 
Rename button under Snapshot 1. Rename the snapshot as Arrow 1. Drag down the 
opacity sliders to 0 for Arrow 2 to Arrow 4 (Watch out! They're in reverse order).
6.	 Set the value of Arrow Choice to Snapshot 2. Click on the Rename button and type 
Arrow 2. Drag down the opacity slider to 0 for Arrow 1, Arrow 3, and Arrow 4. Use 
the following screenshot for reference:

Combining a slider, checkbox, and pop-up  
rig – part 1
In the next exercise, we'll begin to create a complex rig that allows the FCP X user choices over 
a simulated lighting effect.
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, locate the 11_07 project folder. Drag the content of 
the folder to the Effects folder by navigating to Movies | Motion templates from under your 
user on the computer. Double-click on the .moef project from this location. Press the Space 
bar to play back the project. It consists of a still photo that has a light interacting with it. Two 
properties of the light have parameter behaviors applied to them; Intensity and Position. Turn 
each behavior on the Light on and off to see its effect. We want to link a few parameters from 
each of these behaviors to a slider so the FCP X user can control how much the light changes 
intensity and moves simultaneously.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
362
How to do it...
Let's add some of our behavior parameters to a rig.
1.	 Select the Light in the Layers tab and press the F2 key to go to the Behaviors  
tab of the Inspector. You'll see two parameter behaviors; Light Movement and  
Light Flick. We're going to link the amount and frequency parameters from each 
behavior so the FCP X user will have control over them. Ctrl + click on the word 
Amount from the Light Movement behavior and navigate to Add to Rig | Add to  
New Rig | Create New Slider as shown in the following screenshot. A new rig and 
slider are created in the Layers tab. Name the rig Lighting Controls and the 
slider Light Animation Intensity.
2.	 Select Light and press the F2 key to go back to the Behaviors tab of the Inspector. 
Under Light Movement, Ctrl + click on the word Frequency and select Add to Rig | 
Lighting Controls | Add to Lighting Animation Intensity.
3.	 Repeat the preceding step for the Amount and Frequency controls for Light Flick. 
Select Rig in the Layers tab and verify each parameter has been added in the Rig 
tab of the Inspector.
4.	 If you use FCP X or Motion often, the slider will look very familiar. The only difference 
for us Motion users is that it now controls several individual parameters. Think about 
it as one master control to rule them all! We need to set the states for the slider. 
In the Rig tab of the Inspector, move the Light Animation Intensity slider down 
to 0 and set all the parameter states underneath to 0, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Play back the project and notice that no flicker or movement of the  
light occurs.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
363
5.	 In the Rig tab of the Inspector, drag the Light Animation Intensity up to 100. Set 
the Light Flick Frequency to 1, the Light Intensity to 150, the Light Movement 
Frequency to 2, and the Light Movement amount to 150. Play back the project and 
notice the light settings when the slider is set to 100. Drag the Light Animation 
Intensity slider up and down to move between the two states.
www.it-ebooks.info

6.	 Ctrl + click on the word Lighting Animation Intensity in the Rig tab and from  
the menu that appears choose Publish. Select the Project layer and verify in the 
Project tab of the Inspector that the slider has been published. Set the slider to 50.
7.	
Since the project has been saved already, press Command + S to update the template.
8.	 Launch Final Cut Pro. Search in your Media Browser under Effects and bring the 
Lighting Effects into a project. Look in the Inspector and verify the content there.
There's more…
As a bonus step in Motion, there is a Bad TV filter that's been placed on the Effect Source, 
temporarily turned off. Select a few parameters from the Effect to add and control from the 
existing slider.

Combining a slider, checkbox, and pop-up  
rig – part 2
Let's continue with where we left of in the last exercise and add a checkbox rig to our effect.
Getting ready
From the exercise files of this chapter, locate the 11_08 project folder. Drag it to the  
Effects folder by navigating to Movies | Motion Templates under your user on the  
computer. Double-click on the .moef project from this location that is in the folder.  
Press the Space bar to play back the project. It's the same project as the last exercise  
and contains the slider rig we created and published over to FCP X. We want to give the  
user in Final Cut an option to turn on and off the Vignette effect created by our spotlight.  
We can do this by creating a checkbox rig and linking it to the different light types. We'll also 
give access to control the size of a vignette by publishing one parameter.
How to do it...
1.	 Select Light, and in the Light tab of the Inspector, Ctrl + click on the word Light Type 
and navigate to Add to Rig | Lighting Controls | Add To New Checkbox.
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
366
2.	 The checkbox rig is the most simple of the three rigs available. We simply decide what 
happens when the FCP X user checks the box. Select the checkbox rig in the Layers tab 
and rename it as Vignette. In the Widget tab of the Inspector, with the box blank, 
change the value of Light Type to Ambient, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Click the box next to Vignette. Make sure the Light type is set to Point. Play back the 
project while turning on and off the Vignette.
4.	 Ctrl + click on the word Vignette and from the menu choose Publish. Select the 
Project layer and in the Project tab verify the Vignette checkbox is there beneath 
Light Animation Intensity from the previous exercise. Set it to on.
5.	 Select Light and, under the Light tab in the Inspector, Ctrl + click on the word Falloff 
and choose Publish.
6.	 With the Project selected in the Layers tab, in the Project tab rename Falloff to 
Vignette Size. Set the value to 8 as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
367
7.	
Press Command + S to save it to Final Cut.
8.	 Launch Final Cut Pro. Search in your Media Browser under Effects and bring the 
Lighting Effects into a project. Look in the Inspector and see that the new Checkbox 
widget has been published over.
There's more…
Your project settings do matter.
Be careful of your project settings
When dealing with effects, you should always be aware of your project settings. For one 
reason: if we apply an effect to a 5-second project that's animated, in Final Cut it will be 
a 5-second effect. So let's say you apply apply a filter to a clip with a longer duration. The 
effect's speed will be adjusted to fit the clips duration. To avoid this scaling, we need to add a 
specific marker to our project to have the animation loop. Under the Mark menu, add a new 
marker to the project and, in the marker settings, make it a Project Loop End marker.
We should also be concerned with the aspect ratio of our project
www.it-ebooks.info

Publishing Your Work to FCP X
368
Project snapshots and DARS
So far, every effect we created is meant for a 16:9 project. We can verify this by going to  
the Project tab of the Inspector and looking under the Snapshots pane. If we wanted our 
project to be ready for 4:3 or even 3:2 projects, we could add a new snapshot by clicking  
on the plus icon and fixing the template so that it is properly scaled for the correct display  
aspect ratio.

Getting ready
From the exercise files, locate the 11_09 project folder. Drag it to the Effects folder by 
navigating to Movies | Motion templates under your user on the computer. Double-click  
on the .moef project from this location. Press the Space bar to play back the project. It's the 
same project from the last exercise and contains the slider and checkbox rig we created and 
published over to FCP X. We want to give our user in Final Cut the option to have different light 
colors available from a pop-up menu.
How to do it...
1.	 Select Light, and in the Light tab of the Inspector, Ctrl + click on the word Color and 
navigate to Add To Rig | Lighting Controls | Add To New Pop-up.
2.	 Select the pop-up rig in the Layers tab and rename it as Light color.

3.	 In the Widget tab of the Inspector, rename the three snapshots to three colors of 
your choice. Change the color well to match the color of the selected snapshot. It's 
best practice to add only a bit of color, rather than highly saturated values, so the 
light remains close to white. Use the following screenshot for reference:
4.	 Click on the plus icon next to the pop-up widget to add a fourth color. Name it as 
White. Change the Color well to white. Go through each of the states to make sure 
they're correctly set.

Introduction
While learning how to create complex motion graphics can be fun, a lot of times this process 
can be wasted if you don't know the fundamentals of how Motion operates. Some of these 
fundamentals involve customizing Motion to work for you while others involve knowing how 
to correctly export your video to a variety of different platforms and sharing your projects with 
your intended audience. This chapter explores creating some of your own project preferences 
and presets. It also looks at the variety of different export options made available to you in 
Motion as well, through a standalone complimentary application called Compressor.
www.it-ebooks.info

Customization and Exporting

Changing your background, color, and safe 
zones
Motion allows you to customize your project and interface through options available in the 
Preferences menu. Some of those options allow you to make sure your text will be seen on a 
television correctly while others allow you to change the background. Let's explore by heading 
to the Project Properties and Preferences menu.
Getting ready
Launch Motion. From the welcome screen, select a Motion project. From the Presets, choose a 
Broadcast HD 1080 project with a Frame Rate of 29.97, and a Duration of 10 seconds. Click 
on Open. Motion's interface launches. Make sure you are at the beginning of your project. 
Select the Text tool by pressing the T key. Type in any word of your choice close to the center 
of the screen and press the Esc key to exit the text entry mode. Press the F7 key to reveal the 
HUD and make the text black, as shown in the following screenshot. You can't see it any more. 
This is one occasion where we want to be able to see our text and also ensure it's within safe 
boundaries. In the future, the project will also be exported to DVD and we need to make sure 
the background is a solid color rather than a transparent one.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12
375
1.	 From the Edit menu choose Project Properties; it opens in the Properties tab of the 
Inspector. Ctrl + click on the Color well to change the background from black to white 
as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 While the background may look white, it's actually transparent. You can see this 
displayed from the Background Color parameter in Project Properties. Change 
this from Transparent to Solid as shown in the following screenshot. Now the solid 
background will render out.
www.it-ebooks.info

Customization and Exporting
376
3.	 As a final step, we want to ensure our text is within safe boundaries. Not all TV screens 
are made alike and we want to ensure that our text won't be cut off by a TV. To activate 
safe zones, go to the View menu on the top-right corner of the Canvas and choose Safe 
Zones. The inner rectangle is for title safe and the outer box representing 90 percent of 
the screen is for action safe, as indicated in the following screenshot:
There's more…
If you know precisely the way your television or final medium will scale up your final project, 
you can customize the safe zones. Under Motion | Preferences select the Canvas tab. Under 
Zones, as shown in the following screenshot, you can customize the color and size of your 
safe zones.

Creating your own project presets
There are several instances where you may be presenting your final video on an LCD screen 
with unusual dimensions. If this is a common workflow for you, you can create your own 
project presets made available to you right from Motion's welcoming screen.
Getting ready
Launch Motion. Choose any project, frame rate, and duration you like. We won't be saving  
this project. Click on Open. Motion's interface launches. We'll go to Motion's preferences  
and set up our own project preset that will become available for us the next time we launch 
the application.
www.it-ebooks.info

Customization and Exporting
378
How to do it...
1.	 Go to the Motion menu and choose Preferences. Click on the Presets tab. You may 
recognize these presets. This is what's available to us whenever we set up a Motion 
project. Let's say all the projects we export for our main client need to be 900 by 700. 
These current presets are locked by default. To get around this, the Medium preset 
under Presentation is close to this, so we'll duplicate the setting to customize it.
2.	 Click on the Duplicate button at the bottom of the window. With the duplicate 
Medium selected under Presentation, click on Edit.
3.	 Name the preset anything you want. Make the Width and Height 900 by 700 as shown 
in the following screenshot. Depending on where you're exporting to, you may need to 
alter the Pixel Aspect, Ratio, Field Order, and Frame Rate values too.
4.	 Enter a description for the preset and click on OK. Close out the Preferences window.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12
379
5.	 Motion needs to be closed in order for the preset to become available from the menu. 
Press Command + Q to close Motion. Launch Motion and choose Motion project. 
Look under Presets to see the setting you've just made available, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Exporting a full-resolution copy of your 
project
The time has come to share your Motion project masterpieces with the world. If you've  
taken the time to set up your project properties for export, sharing your project will be 
extremely straightforward.

Getting ready
Locate a Motion project you've worked with in one of the previous exercises. Double-click to 
open it. Go through the project and make sure the play range is set to the beginning and end 
of your Timeline. If it's not, press Option + X to reset the play range.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Share menu, choose Export Movie.
2.	 A window opens with a series of options available to us. Look under the Options tab 
and you'll see there are a number of different codecs available to you such as Apple 
Pro Res and h.264. Keep the setting the same as source. Click on the Render tab at 
the top of the window.
3.	 The Render tab allows us to overwrite some of the options you've previously set. One 
thing to note is that Motion leaves the value of Render Quality in your projects set to 
Normal. To overwrite this, change the value of Render Quality to Best as shown in 
the following screenshot. Click on the Summary tab.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12
381
4.	 The Summary tab sums up your choices. It is the last step to check before you send it 
out. Click on Next.
5.	 Name the file, choose a location to save it too on your computer, and click on OK. 
Motion renders out your file. You will be unable to work while the file renders so, 
depending on the complexity of your project, this could be the appropriate time  
for a coffee break!
6.	 Once the process is done, the project opens up in QuickTime and starts to play 
automatically. If you need to play it again, press the Space bar after clicking on  
the player.
Exporting to DVD
As in FCP X, we can build a basic custom DVD right inside Motion and here's how to get  
it ready.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a DVD disc inside your computer. If the Finder comes up, choose Ignore. 
Open a Motion project you want to export by locating it on your hard drive and double-clicking 
on it. Check your project for anything you may want to change before exporting to DVD. If 
applicable, this may be a great opportunity to check whether your text lies within the safe  
zone boundaries.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Share menu, choose DVD.
2.	 Under the Options tab, there is a list of output devices. If you had an external DVD 
drive connected, it would be displayed here.
www.it-ebooks.info

Customization and Exporting
382
The When disc loads option is currently set to Show Menu, as displayed in the 
following screenshot. Set the value of Disc template to White, to change the color, 
and give the DVD an appropriate title. If you had a still image, you could add it as a 
background for the DVD too by clicking on the Add button and finding it on your system.
3.	 Click on the Project tab and hover your mouse over the TV screen to preview it and 
make sure it's in order.
4.	 Go through the remaining tabs at the top of the window to change any setting before 
export. Once you've double-checked it, click on Burn. Motion will first create two DVD 
files; one for audio and one for video. Once it finishes encoding the files, it will encode 
them to disc.
5.	 When Motion is finished, it will give you the option to burn another DVD. The great 
news is it doesn't need to encode the file again. All it needs to do is burn the file  
to disc.

Exporting a still image and image sequence
Depending on your workflow, you may need to export your Motion project to another motion 
graphics, design, or VFX application. You could export an individual frame for your design 
team, to make sure your animations are on the right track, or export your project as a series of 
individual frames by creating an image sequence. Let's see both options in action.
Getting ready
Locate a Motion project you want to export as an image sequence and double-click on  
it to open it in Motion. Move your playhead to a frame you want to export prior to the  
image sequence.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Share menu, choose Save Current Frame. Select PNG Image. Click on the 
Next button. Save the file to your desktop and click on OK.
2.	 Navigate to the desktop and press the Space bar to preview it in the Finder.
3.	 Go back into Motion and navigate to Share | Image Sequence. From Export choose

Exporting using Compressor
Compressor is a standalone application that is sold on the App Store. If you have Motion or 
FCP X, you should know that it opens up a ton of export options. Compressor allows you to 
export out several versions of your project at once while allowing you to continue working in 
Motion as it runs in the background.
Getting ready
Locate a Motion Project you've worked with in one of the previous exercises that's 1920 by 
1080. Double-click to open it. Go through the project and make sure the play range is set to 
the beginning and end of your Timeline. If it's not, press Option + X to reset the play range to 
the length of your project.
How to do it...
1.	 From the Share menu, choose Send To Compressor.

2.	 Compressor launches. In order to send something out, you need at least one setting 
(which format?) and one destination (where will it go?). If you can't see the Settings 
and Destination tabs, navigate to Window | Settings and Window | Destinations to 
bring them up. The window is displayed in the following screenshot:

3.	 Under the Settings tab, click on the disclosure triangle next to Video Sharing 
Services to reveal the presets available. Drag the Large 540p setting to where it  
says Drag Settings and Destinations Here on the Motion project file as shown in  
the following screenshot:
4.	 Go to the Destinations tab and under the Apple category, drag the word Desktop 
over the word Source on the 540p setting you just added as shown in the following 
screenshot. The destinations may seem limited but we can create our own custom 
destinations as well as settings.
5.	 We could go back to the Settings tab and add another setting and destination if we 
wanted. For now, click on the Submit button at the bottom of the Project window.
6.	 Choose a name for this job and leave the other settings at their default.

If you want to, you can see the process revealed in the History tab (Window | 
History). When the job is finished, it will read as successful.
How it works…
Compressor is a standalone application and there's a lot to it, so don't get overwhelmed 
if it was your first time here. Use the Help menu to read the documentation to see all the 
possibilities with Compressor, such as setting up a mini-rendering farm or creating droplets 
you can use to compress video on your desktop. Also, as long as you have Compressor on your 
system, you can export directly from Motion using Compressor settings. Go to the Share menu 
and choose Export with Compressor settings. Choose from one of the available presets.

Saving a template
In Motion, you can save a template for later use. It will be available in the Template section 
when you launch the application. This is a great way to automate your workflow where you 
have a show and are using drop zones to switch content on a consistent basis. This template 
can also be made available to FCP X by publishing it as a generator.
Getting ready
Locate a Motion project you've worked with in one of the previous exercises, preferably one 
you've applied drop zones to. Double-click to open it. Play back the project to make sure 
everything is set up the way you want it.

How to do it...
1.	 From the File menu, choose Publish Template as indicated in the following screenshot:
2.	 Name the template accordingly. If you have worked on some exercises in Chapter 11, 
Publishing your Work to FCP X, this window will look familiar to you. You can add the 
template to a category and theme you have previously created. If this is your first time 
creating a template, you'll have to create a new theme and category for it to go into.
3.	 Since we will not be publishing this template over to Final Cut, we'll leave the Publish 
as Final Cut Generator box unchecked. Click on Publish.
4.	 Close Motion by pressing Command + Q. Relaunch the application. Notice that,  
in the welcome screen on the left-hand side under Compositions, you should  
be able to see your template. Simply choose it and click on Open. It's ready to use!
