Historical Development and Perspectives
of the Series
Metal Ions in Life Sciences*
It is an old wisdom that metals are indispensable for life. Indeed, several of them,
like sodium, potassium, and calcium, are easily discovered in living matter. How-
ever, the role of metals and their impact on life remained largely hidden until
inorganic chemistry and coordination chemistry experienced a pronounced revival
in the 1950s. The experimental and theoretical tools created in this period and their
application to biochemical problems led to the development of the ﬁeld or disci-
pline now known as Bioinorganic Chemistry, Inorganic Biochemistry, or more
recently also often addressed as Biological Inorganic Chemistry.
By 1970 Bioinorganic Chemistry was established and further promoted by the
book series Metal Ions in Biological Systems founded in 1973 (edited by H.S., who
was soon joined by A.S.) and published by Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, for
more than 30 years. After this company ceased to be a family endeavor and its
acquisition by another company, we decided, after having edited 44 volumes of the
MIBS series (the last two together with R.K.O.S.) to launch a new and broader
minded series to cover today’s needs in the Life Sciences. Therefore, the Sigels new
series is entitled
Metal Ions in Life Sciences.
After publication of the ﬁrst four volumes (2006–2008) with John Wiley & Sons,
Ltd., Chichester, UK, and the next ﬁve volumes (2009–2011) with the Royal
Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, we are happy to join forces now in this
still new endeavor with Springer Science & Business Media B.V., Dordrecht, The
Netherlands, a most experienced Publisher in the Sciences.

The development of Biological Inorganic Chemistry during the past 40 years
was and still is driven by several factors; among these are: (i) the attempts to reveal
the interplay between metal ions and peptides, nucleotides, hormones, or vitamins,
etc.; (ii) the efforts regarding the understanding of accumulation, transport, metab-
olism, and toxicity of metal ions; (iii) the development and application of metal-
based drugs; (iv) biomimetic syntheses with the aim to understand biological
processes as well as to create efﬁcient catalysts; (v) the determination of high-
resolution structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules; (vi) the
utilization of powerful spectroscopic tools allowing studies of structures and
dynamics; and (vii) more recently, the widespread use of macromolecular engi-
neering to create new biologically relevant structures at will. All this and more is
and will be reﬂected in the volumes of the series Metal Ions in Life Sciences.
The importance of metal ions to the vital functions of living organisms, hence, to
their health and well-being, is nowadays well accepted. However, in spite of all the
progress made, we are still only at the brink of understanding these processes.
Therefore, the series Metal Ions in Life Sciences will endeavor to link coordination
chemistry and biochemistry in their widest sense. Despite the evident expectation
that a great deal of future outstanding discoveries will be made in the interdisci-
plinary areas of science, there are still “language” barriers between the historically
separate spheres of chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics. Thus, it is one of the
aims of this series to catalyze mutual “understanding”.
It is our hope that Metal Ions in Life Sciences proves a stimulus for new activities
in the fascinating “ﬁeld” of Biological Inorganic Chemistry. If so, it will well serve
its purpose and be a rewarding result for the efforts spent by the authors.

Historical Development and Perspectives of the Series

Preface to Volume 15
Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes
Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases
In this volume of the Metal Ions in Life Sciences series the mastering of dioxygen
(O2), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) by mainly manganese-, iron- and
copper-dependent metalloenzymes and their biomimetic complexes is discussed.
It is closely related to Volume 14, The Metal-Driven Biogeochemistry of Gaseous
Compounds in the Environment, which deals with the biogeochemistry of gases
including dihydrogen
(H2), carbon monoxide
(CO),
acetylene
(HCCH),
dinitrogen (N2), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S), and dimethylsulﬁde
(CH3-S-CH3). The accumulation of O2 in the atmosphere forever changed
the surface chemistry of the Earth. Dioxygen, as electron acceptor, is used in the
respiration of numerous different organisms that conduct a wide variety of chem-
ically complex metabolisms. To produce O2, and to conserve energy by activating
and transforming O2, CH4, or NH3, sophisticated metal-dependent enzymes had to
be evolved by Nature. These catalysts can overcome unusually high activation
barriers of kinetically inert molecules, still a tremendous challenge in the chemical
laboratory today.
In the ﬁrst chapter, the reader is shortly introduced to several aspects and
properties of this special molecule “dioxygen” and its extraordinary impact on
our current Earth. Just think of water (H2O), perhaps the most important compound
containing oxygen, a superb solvent for numerous biomolecules, and the main
source of O2 in the atmosphere. Carl Zimmer reports in his article entitled
“The Mystery of Earth’s Oxygen” (The New York Times, October 3, 2013) about
the work of the geochemist D. E. Canﬁeld from the University of Southern
Denmark: “There’s something astonishing in every breath we take. What is even
more astonishing is that the Earth started out with an oxygen-free atmosphere, it
took billions of years before there was enough of it to keep animals like us alive”.
Clearly, oxygen must be considered one of the most important elements on Earth,
vii

it means life for all aerobes. Eliminate O2 and they cannot conserve enough energy
to support an active lifestyle.
Chapter 2 deals with the light-driven production of dioxygen by photosynthetic
organisms. O2 is abundant in the atmosphere because of its constant regeneration by
the photosynthetic oxidation of H2O. This process is catalyzed by a unique
Mn4CaO5 cluster located in photosystem II, a gigantic multi-subunit membrane
protein complex. Results and interpretations, especially from state-of-the-art X-ray
spectroscopy studies, are summarized. These studies focus on the geometric and
electronic structure and the changes as the Mn4CaO5 site proceeds through the
catalytic cycle.
The following Chapter 3 is devoted to O2-generating reactions in the dark.
These are rare in biology and difﬁcult to mimic synthetically. Recently,
perchlorate-respiring bacteria have been discovered which carry a heme-containing
chlorite dismutase. Notably, the enzyme bears no structural or sequence relation-
ships with known heme peroxidases or other heme proteins. These microorganisms
detoxify chlorite (ClO
2 ), the end product of the perchlorate (ClO
4 ) respiratory
pathway, by rapidly converting ClO
2 to O2 and chloride (Cl).
In Chapter 4 a long time embattled enzyme is reviewed: Cytochrome c oxidase,
the terminal oxidase of cell respiration. This redox-driven proton pump reduces
molecular oxygen to H2O. Highly resolved three-dimensional structures of the bovine
enzyme in various oxidation and ligand binding states have been obtained; they show
that the O2 reduction site – a dinuclear Fe (heme a3), Cu (CuB) center – drives a
non-sequential four-electron transfer for complete reduction of O2 to H2O without the
release of toxic reaction intermediates like the superoxide anion (O2
• ), hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), or the hydroxyl radical (OH•). X-ray structural and mutational
analyses of bovine cytochrome c oxidase, which hosts a sophisticated catalytic
machinery for efﬁcient proton and electron delivery, reveal three possible proton
transfer pathways which can transfer pumped protons and water-forming protons.
Chapter 5 surveys recent important advances in the ﬁeld of transition metal
complexes and the activation of O2. Studies of synthetic models of the diverse iron
and copper active sites have led to fundamental chemical insights into how O2
coordinates to mono- and multinuclear Fe and Cu centers and is reduced to
superoxo, peroxo, hydroperoxo, and, after O-O bond scission, oxo species relevant
to proposed intermediates in catalysis. The involvement of disparate metal ions,
nuclearities, geometries, and supporting ligands provides a rich tapestry of reaction
pathways by which O2 is activated.
Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the functionalization of the gases methane (CH4) and
ammonia (NH3), both in the presence and absence of dioxygen. In view of their
fundamental importance, a remarkable set of tools appears to exist in Nature
to convert CH4 and NH3. These are inert molecules and complex transition
metal-dependent enzymes (methane and ammonia monooxygenases) isolated
from aerobic microorganisms and have been reported to break up the N-H and
C-H bonds. Two distinct methane monooxygenases, a copper-dependent membrane
protein and an iron-dependent cytosolic protein, catalyze the conversion of CH4 to
viii
Preface to Volume 15

methanol (CH3OH), thus playing a signiﬁcant role in the biogeochemistry of this
potent greenhouse gas. The reaction of the reduced Fe (or Cu) centers with O2 leads
to intermediates that activate the relatively inert C-H bonds of hydrocarbons to
yield oxidized products. Notably, there exist “impossible” microorganisms which
use the oxidative power of nitric oxide (NO) by forging this molecule to ammonium
(NHþ
4 ), thereby making hydrazine (N2H4). Others can disproportionate NO into N2
and O2. This intracellularly produced O2 enables these “impossible” bacteria to
adopt an aerobic mechanism for methane oxidation.
In summary, this volume, like the preceding volume 14 of the Metal Ions in Life
Sciences series, offers a wealth of profound information about important processes
in our current biosphere. The emphasis is on the fundamental role of molecular
oxygen for all aerobically living organisms including humans, animals, and plants.
The crucial role of transition metals, speciﬁcally of manganese, iron, and copper, is
addressed in the activation, production, and transformation of molecular oxygen,
but also in the functionalization of methane and ammonia and their impact on the
environment.

Abstract Oxygen has to be considered one of the most important elements on
Earth. Earlier, some dispute arose as to which of the three scientists, Carl Wilhelm
Scheele (Sweden), Joseph Priestley (United Kingdom) or Antoine Lavoisier
(France), should get credit for the air of life.
Today it is agreed that the Swede discovered it ﬁrst, the ﬁre air in 1772. The British
chemist published it ﬁrst, the dephlogisticated air in 1775, and the Frenchman
understood it ﬁrst, the oxygen in 1775–1778. Surely, there is credit enough for all
three to split the “Nobel Prize” awarded by Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann in
their play Oxygen. Molecular oxygen means life. So-called aerobes – these include
humans, animals, and plants – need O2 to conserve the energy they have to gain from

lifestyle. What makes dioxygen that special? It is a non-metal and oxidizing agent
that readily reacts with most elements to form compounds, notably oxides. From a
biological point of view, the most important compound of course is water, H2O, which
provides an excellent solvent for biomolecules. It inﬂuences the climate of the Earth,
and it is the source of almost all of the molecular oxygen in the atmosphere.

Introduction
The element oxygen, 16
8O, is a member of the chalcogen group of the periodic table.
By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen
and helium. It is the most abundant element in the crust of the Earth, mostly tied up
in carbonates, phosphates, and in a wider range of silicates, from clays to zeolites to
quartz. Under standard conditions of pressure and temperature, two oxygen atoms
combine to form the colorless gas dioxygen (O2), the stable form of the element.
Joseph Priestley (United Kingdom) and Carl Scheele (Sweden) independently
discovered oxygen around 1770. It was the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier,
who coined the name oxygen (from the Greek words oxy genes meaning acid and
forming). His experiments were key to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory
of combustion and corrosion.
Dioxygen gas does not react with itself or the other main component of our
atmosphere, dinitrogen (N2), under normal conditions. However, the effect of
ultraviolet light upon O2 is to form the blue gas ozone, O3, the second allotrope
of oxygen. The decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) is one chemical route
to O2 and decomposition of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is another one
(reactions 1 and 2) [1–5].

O2 is kind of a strange molecule, for all its ubiquity. Oxygen’s two least strongly
held electrons, responsible for most of its chemistry, are in two anti-bonding
π*orbitals. One electron goes into each of these HOMOs, thus the ground state of
O2 has two unpaired electrons and is paramagnetic (Figure 1). The ground state O2
is a diradical (3O2; triplet O2) and can enter into many organic and inorganic
reactions. Clearly, its appearance in the atmosphere changed the course of evolution
on Earth. However, compared to other oxygen radicals, such as the superoxide
anion (O2
• ), the hydroxyl radical (•OH), and the peroxide radical (•OOH), triplet

O2 is surprisingly unreactive. Along these lines, O2 in its ﬁrst excited state
(1O2; singlet O2) which is diamagnetic and lies 95 kJ above the triplet ground
state, is much more reactive [5].
Oxygen has to be considered one of the most important elements on Earth.
In short, oxygen means life. All aerobes, including humans, animals, and plants,
need O2 to unleash the energy they scavenge from their environment. Eliminate
oxygen and organisms cannot keep up an active lifestyle, or even enable them
to eat. However, oxygen has also a dark side. It can be toxic, usually the result
from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen at elevated partial
pressures. The so-called central nervous system toxicity was ﬁrst described by
Paul Bert in 1878, referred to as the “Paul Bert effect” [6]. He showed that oxygen
was toxic to many organisms including insects, earthworms, fungi, germinating
seeds, birds, and other animals [7–9]. In 1899, pulmonary oxygen toxicity was
described by J. Lorrain Smith when he noted central nervous system toxicity and
discovered in experiments in mice and birds that 0.43 bar (43 kPa) had no effect but
0.75 bar (75 kPa) of oxygen was a pulmonary irritant [10, 11].
Not counting hydrocarbons, there exists a greater diversity of compounds with
oxygen than with carbon. What makes oxygen so special, inspiring two famous
chemists to write a play performed all over the world [12–14]? It is a non-metal and

oxidizing agent that readily reacts with most elements to form compounds, notably
oxides. Clearly, the most important compound of course is water, H2O, which
provides an excellent solvent for biomolecules, and moderates the climate of the
Earth. Most important, it is the source of almost all the molecular oxygen in the
atmosphere. One can easily picture a scenario with a planet without O2. Let’s
speculate for a moment about Mars, our nearest planetary neighbor. Probably, it
had once a water world too, ready to evolve life. However, a vital constituent was
missing, namely a protective shield of ozone (O3) derived from O2. Without the
ozone layer, the radiation from the Sun could slowly destroy the Martian water.
The hydrogen ﬂoated off into space while the oxygen oxidized the iron-rich Martian
surface soil responsible for its characteristic red color. Perhaps there is, or was,
life on Mars, but if so, it never progressed beyond the bacterial stage [15].
Recently, beginning from two plausible starting points – an uninhabited or
inhabited Mars – possible trajectories of martian habitability over time have been
discussed. By identifying different trajectories of habitability, corresponding
hypotheses could be described that allowed for the various trajectories to be
disentangled and ultimately a determination of which trajectory Mars had taken
and the changing relative abundance of its constituent environments [16].
In this chapter we will brieﬂy discuss several aspects of this fascinating
molecule O2 and its impact on planet Earth, as described in depth in the following
six chapters of this book. These cover the light-dependent production of O2 by
photosynthetic organisms, the production of O2 in the dark by dismutation of
oxyanions, the activation of O2 by transition metal complexes and their role in
catalysis, as well as the respiratory conservation of energy by the terminal oxidase
cytochrome c oxidase. Following are two chapters on the functionalization of the
greenhouse gas methane and on metal enzymes in “impossible” microorganisms
catalyzing the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium and methane. In view of the
remarkable amount of data accumulating in the ﬁeld in recent years, we recommend
several comprehensive reviews as primary references [5, 8, 9, 17–21].

The Rise of Dioxygen in the Atmosphere
The rapid increase of CO2 concentration in Earth’s modern atmosphere is a matter
of major concern. But for the atmosphere of roughly two-and-half billion years ago,
interest centers on a different gas: free oxygen (O2) spawned by early biological
production. The initial increase of O2 in the atmosphere, its delayed build-up in the
ocean, its increase to near-modern levels in the sea and air two billion years later,
and its cause-and-effect relationship with life are among the most compelling and
most heavily disputed stories in the history of the Earth [21].
We take our richly oxygenated world for granted and expect to ﬁnd O2
everywhere. After all, it makes up approximately 21 % of the current atmosphere.
But remember, free O2, at levels mostly less than 0.001 % of those present today,
was anything but plentiful during the ﬁrst half of the Earth’s 4.5-billion-year
4
Sosa Torres, Saucedo-Va´zquez, Kroneck

history. Evidence for a permanent rise to appreciable concentrations of O2 in the
atmosphere between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years (Ga) ago began to accumulate in the
1960s. This increase, now popularly known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE),
left clear ﬁngerprints in the rocks. For example, the ﬁrst appearance of rusty red
soils on land and the disappearance of easily oxidized minerals such as pyrite (FeS2)
from ancient stream beds both point to the presence of O2 in the atmosphere.
The notion of a GOE is now deeply entrenched in our understanding of the early
Earth, with only a few researchers suggesting otherwise [22, 23].
After loss of the hydrogen, helium, and other hydrogen-containing gases from
early Earth due to the Sun’s radiation, primitive Earth was devoid of an atmosphere.
Although it is estimated that oxygen is only the third most abundant element
cosmically coming behind hydrogen and helium, in that order, it is the most
abundant element on the Earth’s crust [23, 24]. The ﬁrst atmosphere was formed
by outgassing of gases, such as H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S, and HCl, trapped in the
interior of the early Earth. This still happens today in volcanoes. It is likely that
the bulk of the atmosphere was derived from degassing early in the Earth’s history
[25–27]. According to geochemist D. E. Canﬁeld from the University of Southern
Denmark there is something astonishing in every breath we take. Even more
astonishing is that the Earth started out with an oxygen-free atmosphere, it took
billions of years before there was enough of it to keep animals like us alive [23, 28].
Early on, the biogeochemical cycling of the basic elements for life including
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, has attracted the interest of researchers in
view of its importance for the Earth with a rapidly growing population, and in view
of its impact on our environment and climate [29]. Atmospheric O2 is controlled
principally by the long-term (multi-million-year) geochemical cycles of carbon and
sulfur. The effect of O2 on the cycles of other elements that exhibit variable
oxidation states has been shown to be far less signiﬁcant quantitatively. The ﬁrst
documented description how the carbon and sulfur cycles affect O2 was given in
1845 [30]. The following global reactions (3) and (4) were deduced.

Reaction (3), from left to right, represents net photosynthesis (photosynthesis
minus respiration) as represented by the burial of organic matter (CH2O) in
sediments. Going from right to left, reaction (3) represents two processes: (i) the
oxidation of old sedimentary organic matter, and (ii) the sum of several reactions
with the resulting reduced carbon-containing compounds released to the Earth’s
surface where they are oxidized to CO2 by atmospheric or oceanic O2. Reaction (4),
from right to left, represents the oxidation of pyrite, FeS2, during weathering of the
continents (organic sulfur is included here with pyrite for simpliﬁcation) and
the sum of thermal pyrite decomposition and the oxidation of resulting reduced
sulfur-containing gases produced by metamorphism and magmatism. Going from
left to right, reaction (4) is the sum of several reactions. These are (i) photosynthesis

and initial burial of organic matter (reaction 3), (ii) early diagenetic bacterial
sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulﬁde, H2S, with organic matter serving as the
reducing agent, and (iii) the precipitation of pyrite via the reaction of H2S with
Fe2O3. The geochemical sulfur cycle also involves hydrothermal reactions between
oceanic crust and seawater sulfate at mid-ocean rises, and these reactions have
been advanced as major controls on atmospheric O2 [30–32].
The evolution of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria was arguably the signiﬁcant
event in the history of life after the evolution of life itself [19, 21]. Molecular
oxygen is a potent oxidizing agent, its accumulation into the atmosphere forever
changed the surface chemistry of the Earth. It is also a favorable electron acceptor
used in the respiration of countless different organisms that conduct a remarkable
variety of different metabolisms. None of these could have prospered before the
evolution of cyanobacteria. Thus, relationships between life, O2, and the surface
chemistry of the Earth are evident. The exact nature of these relationships requires
an accurate understanding of the history of metabolic evolution, including knowl-
edge of when cyanobacteria evolved, as well as a faithful reconstruction of the
history of Earth surface oxidation and O2 accumulation.
It is widely accepted that atmospheric O2 concentrations remained persistently
low for about the ﬁrst two billion years of Earth’s history. The ﬁrst long-term
oxygenation ofthe atmospherewas thought to have occurred approximately 2.3 billion
years ago, during the GOE [33, 34]. However, high-resolution state-of-the-art
techniques revealed an episode of enrichment of the redox-sensitive transition metals
molybdenum and rhenium in the late Archean Mount McRae Shale in Western
Australia. Correlations with organic carbon indicated that these metals were derived
from contemporaneous seawater. Rhenium/osmium geochronology showed that the
enrichment was a primary sedimentary feature dating to 2501 8 million years ago.
Molybdenum and rhenium were probably supplied to Archean oceans by oxidative
weathering of crustal sulﬁde minerals.
These ﬁndings point to the presence of small amounts of O2 in the environment
more than 50 million years before the start of the GOE [35]. Furthermore, recent
examinations of the distribution of chromium isotopes and redox-sensitive
metals in the approximately 3-billion year-old Nsuze palaeosol and in the near-
contemporaneous Ijzermyn iron formation from the Pongola Supergroup in
South Africa revealed extensive mobilization of redox-sensitive elements through
oxidative weathering. A best minimum estimate for atmospheric O2 concentrations
at that time of 3  104 times present levels were computed. In summary, the
ﬁndings suggest the existence of appreciable levels of atmospheric O2 about
3 billion years ago, more than 600 million years before the GOE and some
300–400 million years earlier than previous indications for Earth surface
oxygenation [23].
Because oxygenic photosynthesis must be regarded as the only signiﬁcant source
of free O2 on the Earth’s surface, any evaluation of the oxygenation history must
begin by asking when this metabolism evolved. Current estimates span well over
a billion years representing almost one-third of the Earth’s history. Part of the
problem is related to the difﬁculties in differentiating between oxidation

pathways that can be either biotic or abiotic and can occur with and without free O2.
Banded iron formations (BIFs), for example, are loaded with iron oxide minerals
that often give these ancient deposits their spectacular red colors (Figure 2) [36].
The atmosphere has apparently been oxygenated since the GOE approximately
2.4 Ga ago, but when the photosynthetic oxygen production began, is still a matter
of debate. However, geological and geochemical evidence from older sedi-
mentary rocks indicates that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved well before this
oxygenation event. Fluid-inclusion oils detected in approximately 2.45 Ga old
sandstones contained hydrocarbon biomarkers evidently sourced from similarly
ancient kerogen, preserved without subsequent contamination, and derived from
organisms producing and requiring molecular oxygen. Molybdenum and rhenium
abundances and sulfur isotope systematics of slightly older (2.5 Ga) kerogenous
shales document a transient pulse of atmospheric O2. As early as approximately
2.7 Ga, stromatolites and biomarkers from evaporative lake sediments deﬁcient in
exogenous reducing power strongly imply that oxygen-producing cyanobacteria
had already evolved. Even at approximately 3.2 Ga, thick and widespread
kerogenous shales are consistent with aerobic photoautotrophic marine plankton,
and uranium-lead data obtained from approximately 3.8 Ga old sediments suggest
that this metabolism could have arisen by the start of the geological record.
Hence, the hypothesis that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved well before the
atmosphere became permanently oxygenated seems well supported [23].
Pre-photosynthetic niches were meagre with a much lower productivity com-
pared to modern photosynthesis. Serpentinization and volcanism reliably provided
H2, methanogens and acetogens reacted CO2 with H2 to conserve energy and to

produce organic matter. These skills pre-adapted a bacterium for anoxygenic
photosynthesis, probably starting with H2 in lieu of an oxygen acceptor. Use of
reduced iron(II) and sulﬁde followed as abundant O2 acceptors, allowing produc-
tivity to approach modern levels. Cyanobacteria evolved O2 production but they did
not immediately dominate the Earth. Eventually, both anoxygenic and oxygenic
photosynthesis oxidized much of the Earth’s crust and supplied sulfate to the ocean.
The process of anoxygenic photosynthesis remained important until there was
enough O2 in down welling seawater to quantitatively oxidize massive sulﬁdes at
mid-ocean ridge axes. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis is generally
accepted as the ultimate cause of the GOE, but it has proven difﬁcult to constrain
the timing of this evolutionary innovation. The oxidation of manganese in the water
column requires substantial free O2 concentrations, and thus any indication that
manganese oxides were present in ancient environments would imply that oxygenic
photosynthesis was ongoing.
Manganese oxides are not commonly preserved in ancient rocks, but there is a
large fractionation of molybdenum isotopes associated with the sorption of molyb-
denum onto the manganese oxides that would be retained. Recent investigations on
Mo isotopes from rocks of the Sinqeni Formation, Pongola Supergroup in
South Africa – these rocks formed no less than 2.95 Ga ago – showed that the
Mo isotopic signature was consistent with an interaction of Mn oxides. These
experimental results suggest that O2 from oxygenic photosynthesis started to
accumulate in shallow marine settings at least half a billion years before the
accumulation of signiﬁcant levels of atmospheric oxygen [19, 37]. Along these
lines, in order to illuminate the history of manganese-dependent water splitting,
the behavior of the ancient manganese cycle was examined using newly obtained
scientiﬁc drill cores through an early Paleoproterozoic succession (2.415 Ga)
preserved in South Africa [38].
Applying microscale X-ray spectroscopic techniques coupled to optical and
electron microscopy and carbon isotope ratios, the researchers demonstrated that
the manganese was hosted exclusively in carbonate mineral phases derived
from reduction of Mn oxides during diagenesis of primary sediments. Additional
observations revealed that the original Mn-oxide phases were not produced by
reactions with O2. These results point to a different high-potential oxidant and
suggest that the oxidative branch of the manganese cycle predates the rise of O2,
and provide strong support for the hypothesis that the water-oxidizing complex of
photosystem II evolved from an earlier transitional photosystem capable of single-
electron oxidation reactions of manganese [38].

The Dark Side of Dioxygen
The cellular biochemistry of molecular oxygen is Janus-faced. Its good side
includes numerous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of O2 that drive respiration and
normal metabolism. In 1956 the famous biochemist Otto Warburg pointed out that
8
Sosa Torres, Saucedo-Va´zquez, Kroneck

the respiration of cancer cells was irreversibly damaged, since it never returned to
normal. If respiration was damaged it might be either that the O2 consumption had
been decreased or that, with undiminished O2 consumption, the coupling between
respiration and the formation of adenosine 50-triphosphate had been broken [39].
Several examples of beneﬁcial reactions are covered in this book, for example,
reactions of O2 catalyzed at transition metal sites in highly sophisticated enzymes
such as cytochrome c oxidase and iron- or copper-dependent monooxygenases.
However, the dark side of molecular oxygen encompasses deleterious reactions
of species derived from O2 that can lead to damage of cellular components.
These reactive oxygen species (ROS) have historically been perceived almost
exclusively as agents of the dark side, but it has more recently become clear that
they play beneﬁcial roles as well [40, 41].
As discussed earlier, the O2 molecule is unusual in having two unpaired
electrons in its most stable form (Figure 1). As a consequence, its direct reactions
with other molecules are generally slow in the absence of catalysts or radical
initiators and are therefore not the primary causes of so-called oxidative stress.
ROS, i.e., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, hydroxyl radical,
and other energetic molecules derived from their further reactions appear to cause
the oxidative damage. Their ultimate source appears to be in the mitochondria,
where side reactions of O2 with components of the respiratory chain reduce it to the
superoxide anion.
The threat by ROS is diminished by families of defensive enzymes which
include the superoxide dismutases, the catalases, and the peroxidases. In addition,
free radical chain reactions are controlled by antioxidants, such as L-ascorbate
and the tocopherols. The oxidative damage, which occurs in spite of the action of
these defenses, is largely repaired or is nulliﬁed by de novo biosynthesis. Yet some
damage is sustained and it contributes to mutagenesis, to senescence and to
numerous pathological processes [40, 41].
In a recent FASEB editorial entitled “Free Radicals Can Kill You: Lavoisier’s
Oxygen Revolution”, editor-in-chief Gerald Weissmann expressed his thoughts
about molecular oxygen [42]. We have known since Lavoisier that ﬂames burn,
metals rust, and we take breath, all thanks to O2. But we hadn’t learned how O2
excess does harm until 1954, when Rebecca Gerschman and colleagues [43]
worked out that molecular oxygen poisoning and radiation share the property of
producing oxygen-derived free radicals (Figure 1). Add any of these to living
tissues, and they do damage. Notably, over 15,000 articles about oxidative stress
appeared in the literature just in 2009, a 16-fold increase in only 5 years [42]. Lavoi-
sier had the chemistry right when he told us what happened to the animal oils of our
cells when O2 reacts: It is evident that the oils, being composed of hydrogen and
charcoal combined, are true carbonohydrous or hydrocarbonous radicals; and,
indeed by adding oxygen, they are convertible to vegetable oxides and acids
according to their degrees of oxidation [44].

Outlook
Complex life on Earth crucially depends on strong redox disequilibria afforded by
the almost ubiquitous presence of highly oxidizing molecular oxygen. Yet, as
brieﬂy discussed in this chapter, the unravelling of the history of O2 levels in the
atmosphere remains difﬁcult, and prior to the GOE some billion years ago, the
amount of O2 in the biosphere is considered to have been extremely low as
compared with nowadays values. Thus, the evolutionary histories of life and of
O2 levels are likely intricately intertwined.
The obvious biological proxy for inferring the impact of changing O2 levels on
life is the evolutionary history of enzymes allowing organisms to take advantage
of the redox power of molecular oxygen. These are the O2 reductases linked
to bioenergetics, the groups of cytochrome and quinol oxidases. Consequently,
molecular phylogenies reconstructed for this enzyme superfamily have been
exploited over the last two decades in attempts to elucidate the interlocking
between O2 levels in the environment and the evolution of respiratory bioenergetic
processes [45–47]. Although based on strictly identical data sets, the phylogenetic
approaches produced diametrically opposite scenarios with respect to the history of
both the enzyme superfamily and molecular oxygen on the Earth.
In an effort to overcome the deadlock of molecular phylogeny, the currently
available structural, functional, palaeogeochemical and thermodynamic informa-
tion pertinent to the evolution of the O2 reductase superfamily, which notably
also encompasses the subfamily of nitric oxide reductases, was analyzed. Many
of these enzymes appear to be constructed from only a limited set of building
blocks, for example the mixed-valence copper A center [Cu(1.5+). . .Cu(1.5+)]
discovered in cytochrome c oxidase and nitrous oxide reductase [47]. Based on
these non-phylogenetic data Ducluzeau and colleagues proposed a scenario which
sees the low-afﬁnity O2 reductases as the most recent evolutionary innovation
and the high-afﬁnity O2 reductases as arising independently from NO-reducing
precursor enzymes [46].

Abstract Oxygen, that supports all aerobic life, is abundant in the atmosphere
because of its constant regeneration by photosynthetic water oxidation, which
is catalyzed by a Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II (PS II), a multi subunit
membrane protein complex. X-ray and other spectroscopy studies of the electronic
and geometric structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster as it advances through the inter-
mediate states have been important for understanding the mechanism of water
oxidation. The results and interpretations, especially from X-ray spectroscopy
studies, regarding the geometric and electronic structure and the changes as the
system proceeds through the catalytic cycle will be summarized in this review. This
review will also include newer methodologies in time-resolved X-ray diffraction
and spectroscopy that have become available since the commissioning of the X-ray
free electron laser (XFEL) and are being applied to study the oxygen-evolving
complex (OEC). The femtosecond X-ray pulses of the XFEL allows us to outrun
X-ray damage at room temperature, and the time-evolution of the photo-induced
reaction can be probed using a visible laser-pump followed by the X-ray-probe
pulse. XFELs can be used to simultaneously determine the light-induced protein
dynamics using crystallography and the local chemistry that occurs at the catalytic
center using X-ray spectroscopy under functional conditions. Membrane inlet mass
spectrometry has been important for providing direct information about the
exchange of substrate water molecules, which has a direct bearing on the mecha-
nism of water oxidation. Moreover, it has been indispensable for the time-resolved
X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy studies and will be brieﬂy reviewed in this
chapter. Given the role of PS II in maintaining life in the biosphere and the future
vision of a renewable energy economy, understanding the structure and mechanism
of the photosynthetic water oxidation catalyst is an important goal for the future.

Introduction
Most of the dioxygen in the atmosphere that aerobic life depends on is generated
by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria by the light-induced oxidation of water in
photosystem II (PS II) (reviewed in [1]). PS II is a multi-peptide membrane protein

complex embedded in the thylakoid membranes. Photosynthetic water oxidation
and dioxygen evolution is one of the most important, life-sustaining chemical
processes occurring in the biosphere. PS II is usually found in a dimeric form
in nature with each monomer comprised of more than 20 peptides and about
100 cofactors, which include chlorophylls (Chl), quinones, carotenoids, and lipids.
The primary light-driven charge separation takes place in the PS II reaction center,
P680, where 4 Chls, 2 pheophytins, and 2 quinone molecules are symmetrically
arranged in the two branches of PS II. After the light-induced formation of P680
+, a
redox-active tyrosine (YZ) is oxidized, which in turn oxidizes the oxygen evolving
complex (OEC) on the lumenal side of the protein complex.
The OEC in PS II contains a heteronuclear Mn4CaO5 cluster (Figure 1, inset)
which catalyzes the water oxidation reaction (equation 1),
2 H2O ! O2 þ 4 e þ 4 Hþ
ð1Þ
that couples the four-electron oxidation of water with the one-electron photoche-
mistry occurring at the PS II reaction center, P680. The OEC cycles through ﬁve
intermediate S states (S0 to S4, known as the Kok cycle) that corresponds to the
abstraction of four successive electrons from the OEC (Figure 1) [2, 3]. The dark
stable S1 state is the ﬁrst oxidized state and subsequent illumination leads to the
formation of the S2 and S3 states. Once four oxidizing equivalents are accumulated
(S4 state), a spontaneous reaction occurs that results in the release of O2 and the
formation of the most reduced state, the S0 state. Upon further light excitation, the
initial S1 state is formed once again, and the catalytic cycle is resumed.

Light-Dependent Production of Dioxygen in Photosynthesis

Given the importance of PS II in maintaining life and the anticipated role of light-
induced water-splitting for building a renewable energy economy, understanding the
structure of the Mn4CaO5 catalyst and the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction is
considered to be one of science’s grand challenges [4]. Although details of the chemistry
involved in water oxidation are slowly emerging, the mechanism of the reaction is not
yet clear. In this chapter, we describe results from X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction
studies, especially the use of time-resolved X-ray methods for room temperature studies
using the recently introduced X-ray lasers. We will also describe the use of membrane
inlet mass spectrometry for the elucidation of the mechanism of water-oxidation and its
utility for time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction measurements.

Geometric and Electronic Structure
of the Mn4CaO5 Cluster
X-ray diffraction (XRD) [5–10], X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) [11–13, 19],
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [14–16], infrared spectroscopy (IR) [17],
and UV-vis [18] studies of PS II have provided valuable insights into the structure
and mechanism of the Mn4CaO5 cluster (Figure 2).
Among them, the information regarding the geometric structural changes has
come largely from extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) studies
(reviewed in [12, 13, 19]). EXAFS has provided Mn-Mn and Mn-Ca and Mn-O/N
ligand distances with an accuracy of ~0.02 Å and resolution of ~0.1 Å. An important
feature of EXAFS is that one can control the X-ray dose used by monitoring the Mn

K-edge spectra, thus preventing the reduction of Mn and the concurrent disruption of
the cluster, which occurs when PS II is exposed to the high X-ray dose used in protein
crystallography (see below). EXAFS studies, including solution EXAFS [20], range-
extended EXAFS [21, 22], and single crystal polarized EXAFS [23], have shown that
in the S1 state there are three short Mn-Mn distances at ~2.7 Å, one long Mn-Mn
distance at ~3.3 Å, and three to four Mn-Ca distances [24, 25] at around 3.4–3.9 Å
(based on Sr XAS studies [26–28]). The combination of polarized EXAFS data from
single crystals of PS II with XRD led to three proposed models for the Mn4CaO5
cluster, one of which is shown in Figure 2 (left) [23].
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies using synchrotron radiation (SR) have been used
over the last decade to study the structure of PS II [5–10]. However, the X-ray radiation
damage to the redox active Mn4CaO5 cluster has been an issue, and the damage to the
cluster precedes the loss of diffractivity of the crystals by about two orders of
magnitude in dose in synchrotron-based crystallography (Figure 3) [29, 30]. This is
accompanied by the disruption of the cluster as shown in Figure 4 [29, 30]. The recent
study by Umena et al. at 1.9 Å [10], which has revealed the geometry of the Mn4CaO5

Although, the similarities in the number of Mn-Mn and Mn-Ca vectors is
striking between the XRD and EXAFS structural models, noticeable changes still
exist between the crystal structure and the EXAFS results in which the data was
collected at much lower X-ray dose and the integrity of the sample was maintained
(summarized in Figure 2). The Mn-ligand and Mn-Mn distances are longer in the
1.9 Å crystal structure than those determined using EXAFS by 0.1–0.2 Å for the
Mn-Mn and ~0.3 Å for the Mn-O distances (Figure 2) [20]. These differences in
distances could be caused by radiation damage during the XRD data collection and
thus lead to some of the differences in the proposed models for the clusters.
2.1
Geometric and Electronic Structural Changes During
S State Transitions
The 1.9 Å structure of PS II [10], nevertheless, serves as the current basis to
relate spectroscopic data with the structural changes that occur during the catalytic
Si state transitions. Figure 2 (right) shows the structural model of the cluster
modiﬁed from that shown in Figure 2 (left) taking into consideration the newest
data from XRD and input from XAS [20] and EPR [14] studies. Based on this
structure, possible changes that the Mn4CaO5 cluster undergoes during the S state
transitions has been proposed as shown below in Figure 6. This model incorporates
the ligands and basic structure of Mn found in the 1.9 Å crystal structure and builds
upon this using EXAFS distances, FTIR, and EPR results and the changes in
distances determined using Mn and Sr EXAFS of all the S states (Figure 5).
The oxidation states assigned for the Mn atoms are based on both XANES and
XES [31, 32] and EPR results [14, 33, 34].
The main topological difference between the structure proposed on the basis of
EXAFS (in addition to the differences in the distances) [20, 23], EPR [14], and
theoretical studies [35, 36] and the 1.9 Å XRD structure [10] is the position of the
bridging oxygen atom O5 as shown in Figure 1 (inset), leading to a more open-cubane
like structure. The open-cubane like structure for the S1 and S2 states is supported not
only by polarized EXAFS of single crystals of PS II [20, 23], but has also been
suggested by Siegbahn on the basis of theoretical studies [35], and by the Neese/
Lubitz/Messinger groups on the basis of EPR studies for the S2 state [14, 33, 34]. In the
S2 state a formal oxidation state distribution of (IV,IV,IV,III) for manganese atoms
Mn1,2,3,4 (Figure 6) was assigned based on Mn K-edge XANES and Kβ emission
spectroscopy [31], 55Mn ENDOR measurements [34], and theoretical calculations
[35], with one Mn being oxidized from Mn(III) to (IV) during the S1 to S2 transition.
Different nomenclatures have been used in the literature for identifying the Mn
atoms, and they are all denoted in the caption for Figure 6. The shortening of one
Mn-Mn interaction (~2.79 to ~2.74 Å) during the S1 to S2 transition is likely due to
the change in oxidation state of one Mn (formally Mn(III) to Mn(IV)). FTIR studies
indicate that the Mn3 atom ligated by Ala344 undergoes oxidation in the S1 to S2

state transition [37], however, it is possible that other Mn atoms could be oxidized.
ENDOR studies [38, 39] suggest that Mn4 is the Mn(III) moiety in the S2 state
leaving open the possibility that either Mn3 or Mn1 is oxidized during the S1 to S2
transition.
The recent EPR/ENDOR studies support the formal oxidation state assignment
of Mn4(III3,IV) in the S0 state and Mn4(III2,IV2) in the S1 state [33, 40]. An
oxidation state change of one Mn is also supported by Mn XANES and Kβ emission
spectroscopy for the S0 to S1 state transition. The S0 to S1 state transition is also
accompanied by the shortening of Mn-ligand distances as well as a Mn-Mn distance
(~2.8 to ~2.7 Å) [41]. The shortening of the Mn-ligand and Mn-Mn distances could

be due to the elimination of the Jahn-Teller effect at one Mn after its oxidation.
An open cubane moiety in the S0 state seems likely with either Mn2 or Mn1 being
the Mn oxidized during the S0 to S1 state transition.
As indicated above, there is a consensus that Mn-centered oxidation occurs
during the S0 to S1, and S1 to S2 transitions. However, there has been a long debate
regarding the nature of the S2 to S3 transition [31, 32]. In the S3 state, the question
remains whether a Mn-centered oxidation occurs, Mn4(III,IV3) to Mn4(IV4), see
above, or a ligand-centered oxidation takes place before O-O bond formation and
release of O2. Although Mn XANES studies have produced results that clearly
indicate that in the S0 to S1 and S1 to S2 transitions Mn is oxidized, the S2 to S3
transition studies have not been conclusive, with one study suggesting that Mn may
not be involved in the oxidation, while another study supports such a process [31,
32]. Mn Kβ emission spectra have indicated that the oxidizing equivalents may not
be totally centered on the Mn. RIXS spectroscopy has also shown that formal
oxidation states may be insufﬁcient for describing the complex nature of the
electronic structure in multinuclear clusters like the Mn4CaO5 cluster in PS II,
and that the electrons are strongly delocalized in the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and
that would mean that ligands may be involved in the redox chemistry [42, 43].
Mechanisms that rely on delocalization of charge on the ligands may be more
relevant as discussed below.
EXAFS data show that Mn-Mn distances during the S2 to S3 state transition are
elongated, compared to the S0 to S1 or S1 to S2 state transitions where contractions
are observed. This suggests that the S2 to S3 step is not a simple one-oxidation
state change of Mn, but is accompanied by changes in the geometry of the
Mn4CaO5 cluster [20, 44]. Protonation of an oxo-bridge and the consequent
elongation of Mn-Mn due is unlikely at the S2 to S3 state transition, unless protons
from terminal water molecules are transferred to the bridging oxygens. A struc-
tural change that is caused by the shift of the oxygen O5 from the Mn1 side to the
Mn4 side as illustrated in Figure 6 has been proposed. Such an O5 shufﬂing
possibility has been suggested as a reason for the change from the S2 low spin
(S ¼ 1/2) to S2 high spin (S ¼ 7/2), and on the basis of DFT calculations during the
S2 to S3 state transition [45]. The motion of the oxygen O5 towards the Mn3Ca
open cubane site, generates a Mn3CaO4 closed cubane in the S3 state, and such a
structure is supported by Mn-Mn distances that have been seen in inorganic
complexes [20]. A second possible structure for the S3 state is also shown in
Figure 6.
The 2.7 Å Mn-Mn distances on average are shown to be shortened during the S3
to S0 state transition via the S4 state. This is counterintuitive as the Mn oxidation
state changes from the most oxidized form in the S3 state to the most reduced state
form in the S0 state. But such changes can be explained if the Mn4CaO5 geometry
reverts back to a structure similar to the S1 and S2 states where the Mn3Ca moiety
shows open-cubane like structures, upon the S3 to S0 state transition.

Figure 6 Proposed structural changes during the S state transitions based on the EXAFS distance changes, and possible protonation states (at oxo-bridging and
terminal water molecules) or changes in the ligand environment (type of ligands and ligation modes). The Mn-Mn distances at ~2.7 Å are indicated by green
arrows, ~2.8 Å by blue arrows and ~3.2 Å by red arrows. The dashed line indicates that it may not be a bond. For the S3 and the S0 state two possible models are
shown. Mn atoms are shown in blue (Mn(III)), red (Mn(IV)) or green (Mn(III) or Mn(IV)) possible), Ca in green and the surrounding ligand environment in grey
(adapted from [20]). Several different nomenclatures have been used to refer to the Mn atoms. The numbering scheme shown here is from reference [20]. Mn
(1,2,3,4) here corresponds to Mn(A,B,C,D) from polarized EXAFS studies and Mn(4,3,2,1) from the 1.9 Å XRD structure. The second N atom in the His ring and
other atoms are not shown for simplicity.

Sr can functionally replace Ca [46, 47] in the OEC and, therefore, Sr XAS
studies of Sr-substituted PS II (Mn4SrO5 cluster) have been used to study the
structural changes of the Mn4CaO5 cluster [26–28]. The Mn-Sr (and by inference
Mn-Ca) distance changes were observed during the S state transitions, with signi-
ﬁcant changes during the S2 to S3 state transition (Figure 5). These results, together
with the Mn XAS data, have demonstrated that Ca (or Sr) plays an important role
during the S2 to S3 state transition. This is in line with the fact that the OEC does not
go beyond the S2Yz
• state when Ca (or Sr) is chemically depleted from PS II. Recent
studies by Lohmiller et al. have shown that the depletion of Ca from the Mn4CaO5
core does not disturb the overall structure of the Mn4 moiety or the spin states in
the S1 and S2 states [48], as well as the geometry ([24] and unpublished data,
T. Lohmiller). The fact that Ca can be removed more easily in the S3 state (or that
Ca can be more easily exchanged in the higher S states) compared to the S1 and the
S2 states [49], together with the observations on the Ca-depleted system, implies
that the Mn-Ca binding modes are changed upon the S2 to S3 state transition.
In addition to the changes to the core of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, terminal ligands
from carboxylates, histidine, and water/hydroxo ligands could be involved in the
catalytic reaction. It has been shown using site-directed mutagenesis studies that
some ligands have critical roles in the OEC activity. The replacement of just one
His terminal ligand by a glutamate residue (D1-His332Glu) resulted in a major
change in the EXAFS and XANES spectra [50], illustrating the importance of the
ligands in maintaining the active-site structure and how well-tuned the active site is
by the residues surrounding the Mn4CaO5 cluster.

X-Ray Diffraction and Spectroscopy of Photosystem II
at Room Temperature Using Femtosecond X-Ray Pulses
As described in the previous section, synchrotron-based XRD has been used over
the last decade to study the structure of PS II using cryo-cooled crystals with
improving resolution, with the most recent at a resolution of 1.9 Å. Detailed
mechanistic studies are hampered by the intrinsic radiation-sensitivity of the
Mn4CaO5 cluster to X-rays [29, 30], a problem that is common with other redox-
active metalloenzymes [51–54]. The higher oxidation states of Mn(III)/Mn(IV) in
PS II in the native state are rapidly reduced to Mn(II) upon exposure to X-rays,
resulting in structural disruption with concomitant changes in the Mn-O-Mn bridg-
ing structure, changes in metal-metal and metal-ligand bond lengths. Thus, even at
cryogenic temperatures synchrotron radiation (SR)-based XRD of the Mn4CaO5
structure in PS II is fundamentally limited by the radiation damage to the redox
active metal site. While X-ray radiation damage makes it difﬁcult to obtain struc-
tures of the stable intermediate states of PS II or other metallo-enzymes using
24
Yano, Kern, Yachandra, Nilsson, Koroidov, and Messinger

frozen cryo-trapped states, it is almost impossible to study the transient inter-
mediate states involved in the catalytic reaction, which can only be generated at
ambient conditions, best at room temperature (RT). Thus, it is imperative to work at
RT, if one needs to determine physiologically/or biologically relevant structures
and changes in the catalytic cycle.
The geometric and electronic structure of the intact Mn4CaO5 cluster in the
stable S0 through S3 states has been addressed especially by X-ray absorption and
emission techniques at cryogenic temperatures using a well regulated low X-ray
dose (see above). However, following the time course of the water-oxidation
reaction at RT using X-ray absorption or emission spectroscopic features within
the threshold of radiation damage has been unrealistic with SR sources. In partic-
ular studying the transient [S4] state, when the O-O bond formation and the
evolution of O2 occurs, cannot be captured by traditional cryo-trapping methods
and requires time-resolved detection at RT [17, 55–57]. Within ~1.3 milliseconds
during the S3-[S4]-S0 transition, which is initiated by the 3rd ﬂash, the following
sequence of events is proposed to occur [3]: (a) release of a proton from the S3YZ
ox
state, (b) transfer of one electron to YZ
ox from the Mn4CaO5 cluster, (c) formation
of the O-O bond (peroxo intermediate) coupled with a 2-electron reduction of the
Mn4CaO5 cluster, (d) formation and release of O2 together with a further 2-electron
reduction of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, (e) binding of one or two water molecules to the
cluster, and (f) release of another proton during steps (c) to (e). Determining the
geometric and electronic structures of intermediates of this reaction (e.g., S3YZ
ox
and peroxo state) is pivotal for testing the many hypotheses that have been proposed
for the mechanism of the water-oxidation reaction (see below).
The recent introduction of X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) sources that
produce intense and ultra-short X-ray pulses provide an opportunity to overcome
the above described limitations of SR sources for both crystallography and spec-
troscopy of biological samples with the “collect before destroy” approach [58–60],
which entails measuring the response of the system before the manifestation of
radiation-induced changes. Unlike cryogenic conditions required at synchrotron
sources, the experiments with XFELs can be carried out at RT, making it possible
to obtain molecular movies of the catalyst at work by recording snapshots at
different time points in the catalytic cycle. In such a study crystallography and
spectroscopy can give complementary information: spectroscopy provides detailed
information about changes in the Mn oxidation states and the chemical structure of
the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and crystallography probes the structural changes of the
Mn4CaO5 cluster and the overall protein. As the entire X-ray emission spectrum
can be collected with one excitation energy, this is the method of choice, and as the
same X-ray energy (7.1 keV) can be used for X-ray diffraction and excitation of
Mn, both XRD and XES [61] methods can be applied simultaneously.
Figure 7 shows the design for an experimental setup for the simultaneous
collection of both XRD and XES of the stable and transient intermediate states of
PS II at RT using the femtosecond X-ray pulses from an XFEL.

3.1
Simultaneous X-Ray Spectroscopy and Diffraction
of Photosystem II
Since the start of the ﬁrst hard X-ray XFEL, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)
at Stanford, the application of XFELs to important biological problems has evolved
rapidly. Over the last three years, several pioneering “proof of principle” experiments
both using crystallography and spectroscopy have been conducted, applying this
concept to biological samples, both at LCLS and more recently at the SPring-8-
Ångstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA), the XFEL at SPring-8 in Japan.
The ﬁrst application of both XES and XRD to PS II are described in this section.
3.1.1
X-Ray Emission Spectroscopy of Photosystem II at Room
Temperature Using the X-Ray Free Electron Laser
In contrast to XAS, where the lowest unoccupied orbitals of the metal complexes
are probed, XES probes the highest occupied orbitals of the metal complexes
(Figure 8a, left) [61]. The highest occupied orbitals are of special interest as they
are involved in the actual chemistry during a reaction. The excitation pulse used is
at an energy higher than the binding energy of the electrons in 1s orbitals, and
subsequent emission from the various levels can be examined using secondary
optics. Kβ emission is from the 3p orbitals and is sensitive to the oxidation state and
spin state of the metal. XES is well suited for experiments with XFELs because
energy-dispersive detection schemes can be used, which allows for a full spectrum
to be collected for each X-ray pulse. The scheme for such a dispersive spectrometer
Figure 7 (a) XFEL setup for simultaneous collection of X-ray diffraction and emission spectra from
PS II crystals in the various S state intermediates in a time-resolved manner. The crystals are injected
using an electrofocusing jet to intersect the femtosecond X-ray pulses from the X-ray free electron
laser. Downstream of the X-ray pulses is a multi-pixel multi-array detector for the collection of the
X-ray diffraction data. Perpendicular to the direction of the X-ray beam is an energy-dispersive multi-
crystal emission spectrometer, which focuses the emission spectrum onto a position sensitive detector.
(b) Visible laser pulses advance the PS II into the various S states and the interval between the visible-
laser pump and X-ray laser probe pulse gives the time dependence for the data collected.

is shown in Figure 8a (right) [62]. It is comprised of cylindrically bent analyzer
crystals arranged in a von Hamos geometry, where the X-ray emission signal is
focused in the horizontal direction and dispersed in energy along the vertical
direction onto a multi-pixel array detector. The signal is recorded for each individ-
ual shot and the single spectra from several shots can be added to obtain higher S/N
ratios. Figure 8a (middle) illustrates the sensitivity of the XES technique to the
oxidation states of Mn.
There have been concerns that the X-ray emission spectrum could be sensitive to
changes in the electronic structure induced by the intense X-ray pulse, either
because of the potential Coulomb explosion or inner-shell ionizations. XES data
from solutions of Mn(II)Cl2 and Mn2(III,IV)Terpy are shown in Figure 8b and the
spectra of both the complexes are in good agreement with the data collected at SR
sources under cryogenic conditions [63]. This was especially relevant for the
Mn(III,IV) complex, as this compound is highly redox sensitive and can only be
measured in frozen solutions at 10 K using synchrotron X-rays. The absence of any
deviation from cryogenic SR data indicated that undisturbed Kβ XES can
be measured from aqueous solutions of transition metal compounds at the LCLS.
More importantly, no change in the electronic structure of the Mn was observed,
indicating that under the conditions normally used for hard X-ray protein
crystallography at the LCLS, the “probe before destroy” approach is also feasible
for spectroscopy of radiation-sensitive transition metals.
Figure 8c shows the Mn Kβ emission spectra of the S1 state of PS II at RT using
an XFEL. The RT XFEL spectrum is identical to that collected with SR at 8 K, and
clearly different from the data from Mn(II)Cl2 or that of PS II collected at RT at SR
sources. The spectra of damaged PS II are similar to that obtained for Mn(II)Cl2.
The XFEL XES data are very encouraging as they clearly demonstrate that it is
indeed possible to collect spectra from undamaged PS II using the very intense
XFEL pulses even at RT. Moreover, these spectra from PS II can be collected
simultaneously with the collection of the XRD data (see below), which shows that
the crystallographic data originate from an intact PS II, and that XES can be used to
determine the integrity of the PS II samples and to conﬁrm the intermediate state of
PS II (see below).
3.1.2
X-Ray Diffraction Studies of Photosystem II at Room
Temperature Using the X-Ray Free Electron Laser
Single-crystal XRD experiments, when performed with conventional SR, generally use
one or a few crystals that are rotated through a set of angles to collect a complete data
set for deriving the electron density of the macromolecule. The XFEL destroys the
sample with a single X-ray pulse, requiring the full data set to be assembled from a
series of still diffraction shots of individual microcrystals [64, 65]. This technique is
now becoming known as serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). The ~40
femtosecond-duration XFEL pulse can deliver diffraction/spectroscopy information
on time scales that outrun radiation damage, allowing PS II reaction dynamics to be
studied under functional physiological conditions, while the small beam focus size
permits the investigation ofextremely small andweakly diffractingPS II microcrystals.

In the case of XRD measurements, using femtosecond pulses from XFELs it has
been postulated that there is a self-gating mechanism where the signal contains
contributions only from the initial undamaged sample. It is thought that the later part
of the X-ray pulse will interact with a strongly distorted or a disrupted crystal lattice,
contributing only to diffuse background scattering rather than the Bragg scattering.
Hence, the signal that is collected would only reﬂectthe mostly undamaged sample as it
is seen during the initial part of the pulse. Thus, XRD data from XFELs is free of data
resulting from damaged sites expected at the intensities that are common with XFELs.
The initial XRD experiments of PS II at LCLS have largely conﬁrmed these observa-
tions. Moreover, the simultaneous XES data obtained from the crystals has shown that
under these conditions, the Mn4CaO5 cluster is also undamaged [66, 67].
The structure of PS II obtained using the XFEL is isomorphous to that from SR
structures, showing that there are no speciﬁc large-scale differences either due to
radiation damage or due to temperature differences (cryo-cooled crystals at SR and
RT with XFEL) (Figure 9a). The maximum of the electron density map (Figure 9b)
was found in the region of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. The lack of inﬂuence of model
bias was conﬁrmed by computing the various omit maps; omitting the Mn4CaO5
cluster, or the non-heme iron (located at the stromal side of the PS II complex), or the
four central Chls from the phasing model. In each case, positive difference electron
density for the omitted cofactors was visible in the omit map at the expected location
and is an unbiased indication of the presence of these groups in the PS II microcrys-
tals. The mFo-DFc difference peak in the Mn4CaO5 omit map is shown in Figure 9c.
The dose deposited on the PS II crystals by the XFEL for each individual shot
was ~108 Grays (Gy or J kg1). This dose is an order of magnitude higher than
the Henderson/Garman limit of 2–3  107 Gy [68, 69], generally considered to be
the limit for loss of diffractivity in cryogenic SR-based XRD, and about 100 times
higher than the dose used for SR XRD data collection of PS II at 100 K (~1  106 Gy
for the 1.9 Å crystal structure). With PS II microcrystals, cryogenic SR measure-
ments are not possible due to the extent of X-ray exposure and loss of diffraction;
however, the same PS II microcrystals exhibit diffraction spots with the XFEL
technique at RT. Despite applying this high dose at RT, there appears to be no loss
of diffractivity or visible differences between the RT XFEL and cryogenic SR

structures. This fact demonstrates that the femtosecond XFEL pulses (~45 fs) are
short enough to outrun the damage processes present in conventional SR XRD [70].
It should be noted that, for several protein structures, there were recent reports
on differences between structures obtained at RT and cryogenic temperatures [69]. PS
II shows several large loop regions that are extrinsic to the membrane and
are potentially ﬂexible. In addition, only a small number of amino acid residues are
involved in providing crystal contacts, raising the possibility that these loop
regions could adopt different conformations depending on the crystal conditions.
Interestingly, no deviationsin position for these loop regions are found when comparing
the SR cryogenic and the XFEL RT structures, indicating that there are no large-scale
effects on the structure of PS II due to the freezing necessary for cryogenic XRD.

3.2
Intermediate S State Transitions and Mechanism
of Dioxygen Evolution
A real advantage of XFEL-based XRD or spectroscopy is not only to study
biological systems at RT under physiological conditions, but to also study the
enzymatic reactions in real time so that one can understand the electronic and
structural processes in play. In pursuit of this goal with PS II, and to advance PS II
into the higher S states, an in situ illumination setup has been integrated into the
sample delivery system (Figure 7). The illumination setup consists of three lasers
directly coupled via ﬁber-optic cables to the silica capillary for sample delivery and
a fourth laser intersecting the jet at the X-ray interaction point. The idea is to be able
to advance PS II through the S state cycle and study the last light-induced S3 to S0
advance via the transient and other possible intermediate states in a time-resolved
manner to understand the O-O bond formation step. In preparation for these studies,
the very ﬁrst illuminated state, the S2 state, has been generated in situ and studies
using both XRD and XES (see below).
3.2.1
X-Ray Free Electron Laser-Based X-Ray Diffraction and X-Ray
Emission Spectroscopy of Photosystem II in the S1 and S2 States
Recently, XES and XRD data from PS II microcrystals highly enriched in the S2
state have been successfully collected and analyzed. The XES data did not exhibit a
signiﬁcant difference from the S1 data (Figure 9d), showing that there was no
damage to the electronic structure of the Mn cluster in either state by the visible-
laser pump/X-ray-probe method. Due to the limited sample amount, the quality of
the S2 data was poorer and the small shift expected between the S1 and S2 state
could not be resolved within the signal/noise ratio of the spectra.
XRD data for PS II enriched in the S2 state was collected using the XFEL with the
setup described in Figure 7. As the S2 state data are isomorphous to the S1 state data,
isomorphous difference map between the S1 and S2 states was calculated (Figure 9d).
A detailed analysis of this map revealed no statistically relevant difference peaks.
This indicates that within the limits of the currently available resolution there are no
larger scale structural changes associated with the oxidation of the Mn4CaO5 cluster
from the dark stable S1 to the ﬁrst illuminated S2 state. These results represent the ﬁrst
step in determining the electronic and geometric structure changes during the water
oxidation reaction in PS II in a time-resolved manner.

Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry and Photosystem II
Monitoring the isotopic composition of the product, O2, by time-resolved
isotope-ratio membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (TR-IR-MIMS) is a powerful
method for kinetic and functional analyses in PS II research in particular,

in combination and for the study of the mechanism of photosynthetic
water-oxidation to O2.
Schematic views of a TR-MIMS set-up employing an isotope ratio mass
spectrometer are shown in Figure 10. This type of mass spectrometer is normally
equipped with an electron-impact ion source, magnetic sector ﬁeld analyser, and
Figure 10 Simpliﬁed scheme of a MIMS set up, in which the production of gaseous analyte
is initiated by (a) illumination of degassed photo-active samples, (b) illumination of non-degassed
samples that were subsequently injected into a degassed buffer, and (c) the reaction of non-degassed
chemicals injected into the degassed sample. The gaseous reaction products penetrate through the
gas-permeable membrane and reach the high vacuum section where they are ionized by electron
impact. The generated ions are separated by a magnetic ﬁeld according to their mass-to-charge ratios
and detected by Faraday cups. The resulting signals of the different isotopes are ampliﬁed and
recorded online simultaneously.

individual detectors (Faraday cups) that provide simultaneous detection of several
masses (ions) with high sensitivity and signal stability. For its ability to monitor
and to selectively analyze all isotopologues (molecules that differ only in
their isotopic composition) of gaseous products with one instrument, the
TR-MIMS approach in combination with isotope enrichments became an
indispensable tool for kinetic and functional analyses of photosynthetic enzymes
[71–73]. The key part of the TR-MIMS instrument is a gas inlet system that is
integrated within a MIMS cell. The design of MIMS cells may vary depending
on the measuring purposes [71, 72], but all of them contain a gas-permeable
membrane functioning as analyte inlet system into the vacuum of the mass
spectrometer. The coupling of such a cell to various light sources (e.g., Xenon
lamps or lasers) allows carrying out the measurements of light-induced O2
evolution in photosynthetic samples or light-driven O2-evolving artiﬁcial
catalysts. Before entering the ion source of the mass spectrometer the analytes
pass through a cryogenic trap, which freezes out water vapor that inadver-
tently pervaporate through the membrane in trace amounts. Enrichment of the
aqueous sample suspension with oxygen’s heavy isotope (18O) for isotope ratio
measurements of O2 (and/or CO2) isotopologues is a useful and commonly used
tool in studies of water-splitting chemistry and/or related reactions. Therefore,
most of the experiments are carried out in H2
18O-labelled sample suspensions/
solutions.
4.1
Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry and S State
Turnover in X-Ray Free Electron Laser Studies
In the simultaneous XRD and XES experiments using the XFEL, although XES
provides an in situ check for the quality of the sample and the advancement of the S
states in the Kok cycle, it is advantageous to have another independent method to
conﬁrm the turnover status of the PS II samples. MIMS has been the method of
choice for these studies.
In order to achieve a high population of the illuminated states, the illumination
parameters had to be optimized. For this purpose, MIMS has been critical.
Using this method the conditions required for the best turnover under the
conditions of the XFEL experiments have been optimized. These include the ﬂow
rate of PS II, the power and frequency of the laser illumination, and the delay
conditions. The MIMS experiment has been used to achieve about 73 % of the
sample in the ﬁrst illuminated state (S2, see Figure 11). Such independent assess-
ments and optimizations of the turnover are critical for a success of the XFEL
experiment.

4.2
Time-Resolved Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry
and Insights into Oxygen Evolution
The most signiﬁcant contribution of the TR-MIMS in understanding of the water-
oxidation mechanism has been its application for studying substrate H2O binding in
the different S states of the OEC. In these experiments the binding of water to the
OEC was probed by the rapid injection of H2
18O into the PS II samples which were
preset into the desired S state by pre-illumination with 0, 1, 2, or 3 ﬂashes as
illustrated in Figure 12. After the desired incubation time, O2 evolution is induced
by a sequence of additional ﬂashes. The exchange rates of the two water molecules
are calculated from the dependence of the 16O18O and 18O18O yields as a function
of incubation time (Table 1). A short mixing time of the H2
18O with PS II samples
after injection and a very low level of dissolved O2 in the H2
18O are highly important
for these experiments since they determine the time resolution of the TR-MIMS
measurements. In the ﬁrst H2

exchange kinetics could not be resolved [74, 75]. The development of the MIMS
cell by Messinger, Badger, and Wydrzynski [76], which allowed for fast mixing of
H2
18O with the sample and also implemented O2 removal from the labeled water by
the glucose – glucose oxidase – catalase method, greatly improved the time
resolution down to the milliseconds scale and allowed measurements of substrate
water exchange in all S states [76–78].
Figure 13 illustrates the characteristic water exchange kinetics in the S3 state.
The yields of the singly-labeled (16O18O) and doubly-labeled (18O18O) isotopo-
logues of O2 are plotted as a function of H2
18O incubation time in the S3 state.
Figure 13 (top) shows the result when only one of the two possible 18O-water
substrates is exchanged, while Figure 13 (bottom) is for the case when both
18O-waters are exchanged. The biphasic behavior of the 16O18O rise (detected
at m/z ¼ 34) is known to represent the exchange rates of two independent slowly
(Ws, see below) and fast exchanging substrate water molecules (Wf, see below)
bound at separate sites within the OEC. In contrast, the 18O18O product (monitored
at m/z ¼ 36) exhibits a mono-exponential rise with a rate equal to that of the slow
phase kinetics of the 16O18O data, thus-reﬂecting the exchange of the same ‘slowly’
exchanging substrate water as observed at m/z ¼ 34. This ﬁnding clearly conﬁrms
that the two phases of the 16O18O data are an intrinsic feature of the OEC and do not
originate from PS II heterogeneity [73, 76, 77].
Further TR-MIMS experiments also revealed that the ‘slowly’ exchanging water
is bound to the OEC in all the S states, while the ‘fast’ exchanging water was
detected only in the S2 and S3 states [77–80]. Thus, the TR-MIMS technique
provides not only the most direct evidence for independent substrate water binding
within the OEC, but also allows to monitor the change in their binding afﬁnities
throughout the reaction cycle. For a complete overview of the TR-MIMS ﬁndings in
this ﬁeld, we refer the readers to recent reviews [72, 81, 82].
The most likely mechanisms presently being considered are presented in
Figure 14 below. The water-exchange results do not support the nucleophile attack
mechanisms in which Ca-bound water attacks a terminal oxo or a μ-oxo bridge.
Similarly, mechanisms involving two μ-oxo bridges, or two terminal waters seem
unlikely. Two likely options are that O5 is Ws, where Wf is either W2, the terminal
hydroxo ligand to MnA4, or a water not seen in the crystal structure (see above,
Figure 1, inset) [35, 82–84].

Concluding Remarks and Future Directions
Ultimately, understanding the water splitting mechanism requires the characterization
of the last step (S3-S4-S0), where the O-O bond is formed and O2 is evolved. Unlike
other intermediate S states (S0 through S3), the kinetically unstable S4 state cannot be
Figure 13 The characteristic water exchange kinetics in the S3 state as measured in spinach
thylakoids with the time resolution of 8 ms. The yields of the singly-labeled (16O18O) and doubly-
labeled (18O18O) isotopologues of molecular oxygen are plotted as a function of H2
18O incubation
time in the S3 state. While the former plot reﬂects the result when only one of the two possible 18O-
water substrates is exchanged, the latter one is for the case when both 18O-waters are exchanged.
The biphasic behavior of the 16O18O rise (detected at m/z ¼ 34) is known to represent the exchange
rates of two independent slowly (Ws) and fast exchanging substrate water molecules (Wf) bound at
separate sites within the OEC (see Table 1). The data in panel (b) are kinetically limited by the
exchange of Ws and thus show a single slow phase identical to that in panel (a).

cryo-trapped by freeze-quenching techniques, and therefore requires time-resolved
studies at ambient conditions [55]. The S3-S4-S0 transition includes ﬁve sequential
events: (a) extraction of one electron, (b) release of two protons, (c) release of
molecular oxygen, (d) binding of one or two substrate water molecules to the
Mn4CaO5 cluster, and (e) four-electron-reduction of the Mn4CaO5 cluster.
Several O-O bond formation mechanisms have been proposed [83], and three
representative ones are shown in Figure 14. Mechanism (a) invokes an O-O bond
formation by a radical-type mechanism, mechanism (b) involves an electrophilic
high-valent Mn(V), and mechanism (c) has an end-on peroxo ligand to a single Mn
center. Fundamental differences in the chemistry of O-O bond formation and O2
evolution exists between the three types of mechanisms. In the ﬁrst case there is
delocalization of the charge to the ligands, while in the second case the charge is
mainly centered on the Mn. Not much is known about the electronic structure of the
third case, although such intermediates have been observed for Cu and Fe
metalloenzymes and Mn model compounds. Mn(V) has also been proposed as a
transient intermediate in the catalytic cycle of epoxidation reactions, and the
water-oxidation in PS II might involve a similar intermediate. The high reactivity
of the S4 state intermediates is not in line with the stability of synthetic Mn(V)
compounds, which are all in a low-spin conﬁguration. We would therefore rather
expect a high-spin, reactive Mn(V) to be involved. However, so far there is
Figure 14 Schematic presentation of three mechanisms proposed for O-O bond formation during
the S3 - [S4] - S0 transition. (a) involves a bridging O ligand and a radical and/or a delocalized
charge on the Mn cluster. (b) involves the electrophilic mechanism with a high valent Mn(V) and
terminal O ligation, and (c) involves an end-on peroxo ligand to a single Mn center. These
schematics do not represent all the possible variations that have been proposed within the
categories of radical-based and nucleophilic attack mechanisms.

no direct spectroscopic evidence for the existence of such a Mn(V) species in PS
II. It is known that up to the S3 state all four Mn centers are in a high-spin
conﬁguration, hence it is likely that if Mn(V) is involved it would also be in a
high-spin conﬁguration, and therefore reactive. The presence of Mn(V) or lack
thereof and its spin state is particularly important for developing artiﬁcial inorganic
water splitting catalysts, a central issue in solar fuel generation. These questions,
along with the need to characterize the proposed transient S4 state and other kinetic
intermediates that may be present, offer challenges for the future and they need to
be addressed before we can fully understand where and how plants oxidize water
to dioxygen.

Abstract O2-generating reactions are exceedingly rare in biology and difﬁcult to
mimic synthetically. Perchlorate-respiring bacteria enzymatically detoxify chlorite
(ClO
2 ), the end product of the perchlorate (ClO
4 ) respiratory pathway, by rapidly
converting it to dioxygen (O2) and chloride (Cl). This reaction is catalyzed by a
heme-containing protein, called chlorite dismutase (Cld), which bears no structural
or sequence relationships with known peroxidases or other heme proteins and is
part of a large family of proteins with more than one biochemical function.
The original assumptions from the 1990s that perchlorate is not a natural product
and that perchlorate respiration might be conﬁned to a taxonomically narrow
group of species have been called into question, as have the roles of perchlorate
respiration and Cld-mediated reactions in the global biogeochemical cycle of
chlorine. In this chapter, the chemistry and biochemistry of Cld-mediated O2
generation, as well as the biological and geochemical context of this extraordinary
reaction, are described.

Introduction
The S4 state of photosystem II (PSII) – the catalytic species poised to make the
O¼O bond of O2 – is one of the most sought-after, and most elusive, chemical
structures in the history of biological chemistry [1, 2]. In spite of years of effort and
a wide spectrum of approaches, the particulars of how PSII makes this deceptively
simple bond are still controversial. At the same time, nature offers few other
paradigms for reactions that couple two oxygen atoms. Currently, there is just
one other known natural process: chlorite (ClO
2 ) is converted to chloride (Cl)
and dioxygen (O2) by an enzyme called chlorite dismutase (Cld).
These two systems make for an interesting comparison. PSII is an exceedingly
complicated, membrane-associated molecular machine, comprised of around
20 protein subunits (depending on the organism) and a series of cofactors including
35 chlorophyll a molecules, 12 β-carotenes, two pheophytins, two plastoquinones,

two hemes, one bicarbonate, 20 accessory lipids, and one non-heme Fe2+, all in
addition to the famous distorted cubane Mn4CaO5 cluster where O2 evolution takes
place [3]. This impressive apparatus harvests energy from light, using it to drive an
exquisitely timed series of electron and proton transfers that result in the net
splitting of water and emission of O2 gas.
In sharp contrast to PSII, Cld is a relatively simple, water-soluble heme enzyme
that, outside of making an O¼O bond with exquisite efﬁciency, has little else to
do [4]. As a consequence, Cld provides a window into one set of electronic and
structural requirements for joining a pair of O atoms under biological conditions.
Understanding the Cld reaction may therefore yield some analogies for PSII-S4 and
perhaps synthetic, structurally still simpler water-splitting catalysts. At the same
time, the Cld reaction extends the known repertoire of heme catalysis since, though
many heme proteins and model complexes react with chlorite, the issuance of O2
from any of them is an exceedingly rare outcome. The following chapter describes
the structures and chemical mechanisms of the Clds, their diversity, and what
is currently known about the geochemical and biological forces that gave rise to
this type of catalysis. It concludes with a summary of some of the relevant small
molecule and heme protein chemical reactivity with chlorite, asking effectively
why they are not “Clds,” and what limits O2 generation in these cases.

Geochemistry of the Oxochlorates
Any thermodynamically well-matched combination of electron source and sink,
no matter how exotic, can seemingly be found driving the metabolism of some
microbial species. The oxyanions of main group elements such as nitrogen, sulfur,
selenium, and arsenic, organic compounds of nitrogen and sulfur, and even solid
mineral species (manganese, iron) can all serve as respiratory electron acceptors,
provided that an electron donor with a larger reduction potential is available in the
same environment. The redox tower diagram illustrates this point, listing several
“edibles” (electron sources) and “breathables” (electron sinks) known to be used
by various microbial species (Figure 1) [5]. Metabolism of these elements beneﬁts
the microbe, and at the same time strongly impacts global geochemical element
cycles.
The ability to assume or toggle between different metabolic strategies
depends on the presence of the appropriate enzymatic pathways in the microbe’s
genome. Some environmental microbes appear to be avid collectors of such path-
ways, duplicating and transferring them laterally from species to species and
providing the raw materials from which new metabolic capabilities can emerge.
Evolution, however, depends on the presence of environmental selection pressures
to drive it. Microbial perchlorate respiration therefore was a surprise when it was
ﬁrst discovered in the late 1990s [6–11]. At that time, perchlorate was assumed to
be almost exclusively a man-made chemical species with few known natural
repositories. Wide-scale industrial production of perchlorate as a rocket propellant,

constituent of ﬁreworks and explosives, and chemical oxidant moreover only began
in the U.S. in 1910 [12], and was increasingly identiﬁed as a freshwater pollutant at
around the same time that perchlorate-respiring bacteria were discovered [13, 14].
The evolution of microbial perchlorate respiration therefore would have had to
occur very quickly in response to man-made perchlorate, or in response to natural
sources of perchlorate that had yet to be discovered. Which could it be?
Among other evidence, the identiﬁcation of perchlorate respiration in
diverse microbes from geographically far-ﬂung locales, including places untainted
by man-made oxochlorates, now suggests that perchlorate and bacteria that can
eliminate it have indeed been with us for a long time. Perchlorate respiration in fact
appears to play a pivotal and previously unappreciated role in the global cycling of
chlorine. It is also potentially responsible for the dramatically different distribution
of perchlorate on the surface of the Earth versus Mars, as described below.
2.1
Oxochlorates as Respiratory Anions
Using perchlorate as a terminal electron sink in respiratory pathways makes great
chemical sense. It is highly water-soluble [14], a fact that also colors its ability to
distribute in soils and travel in groundwaters [15]. Thermodynamically, it is a
powerful electron acceptor. The standard reduction potential for the complete
reduction of perchlorate to chloride is on par with the ﬁve-electron reduction of
Figure 1 Redox tower,
showing potential electron
donors and acceptors used

donor (“edible”) and
acceptor (“breathable”)
must together yield a
process that is

tower, the edible must be
higher than the chosen
breathable. Tower data are

The successive reductions of chlorate (Cl5 +) to chlorite (Cl3 +), chlorite to
hypochlorite (Cl1 +), and hypochlorite to Cl– are likewise highly thermodynami-
cally favored [14, 18, 19]:

ð6Þ
Biologically, reduction of perchlorate to the product chlorate or chlorate to
chlorite occurs with transfer of an oxygen atom, which in each case is protonated
to form water. Facilitating proton transfer is consequently likely to be important for
each of these reductions. Note that all of the reactants and products are written here
as anions, though the standard potentials are reported (pH ¼ 0, versus NHE) and the
pKas of their proton dissociation reactions (HClOx ⇌ClO
x + H+) span a very broad
range: 10 (ClO
4 ), 1 (ClO
3 ), 1.72 (ClO
2 ), 7.5 (ClO–), and 8 (Cl–) [14, 19, 20].
Finally, perchlorate is also a good bet from a kinetic perspective. Like O2, its
reactions with many potential reductants tend to be slow [14]. As a consequence,
perchlorate is relatively stable under aqueous/biological conditions. Rather than
simply “burning up” in a biological matrix, its thermodynamically favored
reduction, like O2’s, would need to be catalyzed.
2.2
Natural Abundance of Perchlorate on Earth
From a geological perspective, perchlorate seems a decidedly unattractive electron
acceptor because it has not accrued to nearly the same extent as O2 or nitrate, either
on land or at sea [21]. Naturally occurring perchlorate at its most abundant can be
found comingled with deposits of sodium nitrate in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile (see Figure 2 in Section 2.4). These deposits have been heavily mined
as sources for nitrate-based fertilizers. Chilean nitrate is in fact estimated to be
the source of ~81  106 kg of perchlorate imported to the U.S. (1909–1997)
[22–24]. The Atacama itself is a highly unusual, arid, and geologically exotic
place. It is believed to have persisted as a nearly rainless climate for 10–15 million
years, over which time its nitrate deposits have accumulated. The arid climate and
general lack of hydrologic events or large scale biotic (including human) incursions
may be responsible for the preservation of the nitrate deposits and for the

co-concentration of ions like perchlorate and chromate, which are otherwise not
found in large amounts anywhere on earth [25]. These deposits have been shown to
have a distinct oxygen isotope pattern, making it possible to distinguish natural and
synthetic perchlorate [26].
Less extreme arid and semi-arid North American environments have been
surveyed for perchlorate. Many of these have also accumulated the ion in scarcely
detectable, very small amounts: for example, on the order of 1–10 μg kg1 dry soil,
where chloride might also be present at 3 or more orders of magnitude greater
concentrations [27–30]. Considerably higher (100-fold) concentrations of perchlo-
rate have been found in the very arid soils of the Antarctic [30]. Accumulation of
the anion there may have occurred for the same reasons as in the Atacama: that is,
because the land has remained extremely dry and unperturbed by either human or
microbial activity [31].
The detection of perchlorate in areas where it might have remained undisturbed
over long time periods suggests that there are indeed natural mechanisms for
perchlorate production. These mechanisms must have been at work for at least
several thousand years. Perchlorate has been detected in ground waters deposited
thousands to tens of thousands years ago and in glacial ice dating as far back as
2000 years [32–34]. Results from surveys of ground water, ice, and relatively
unperturbed deserts have been used to estimate a 0.1–3  109 kg “global inventory”
of natural perchlorate presently on Earth [22, 28, 33].
Anthropogenic contributions of perchlorate to the environment are relatively
recent and far less subtle. The redistribution of natural, Chilean perchlorate stowed
away with the nitrate fertilizers has already been mentioned. Industrial perchlorate
production from 1951 to 1997 in the U.S. has been estimated as 5  109 kg [22]: a
ﬁgure on the same order as the Earth’s entire estimated inventory of natural
perchlorate. Man-made perchlorate has been used in the production of rockets,
missiles, ﬁreworks, and the like, where perchlorate’s oxidizing power allows it to be
used as a propellant and explosive [12]. Environmental surveys in the early 2000s
identiﬁed perchlorate as a widespread contaminant in drinking water, crops, and
milk, particularly in areas of the southwest United States where perchlorate had
been produced or used [16, 21, 35–41]. Microbial perchlorate respiration was
documented at around the same time [42, 43], and its origins were then unclear.
The identiﬁcation of perchlorate-respiring bacteria in non-contaminated sites and
of perchlorate reservoirs in places predating human activity both suggest that
natural perchlorate supplied the initial selection pressure needed for the evolution
of perchlorate respiration. This suggestion has gained further support as
perchlorate-reducing enzymes have been identiﬁed in both taxonomically broad
and temporally ancient reaches of the tree of life (see Section 3.1.)
2.3
Atmospheric and Extraterrestrial Origins of Perchlorate
Natural perchlorate may be accruing on the Earth’s surface, but there remains no
documented geological or geochemical means of producing it. It would appear as if
50
DuBois and Ojha

perchlorate simply falls out of the sky. This suggestion is not so facetious, as the
identiﬁcation of perchlorate in pristine and geographically widespread ground
waters, ice cores, rain, and snow indeed suggests atmospheric origins [34, 44].
Three atmospheric sources of perchlorate have been proposed:
First, laboratory experiments with simulated lightning have shown that perchlorate
is produced, albeit less efﬁciently than nitrogen oxides, in oxygenic atmospheres in
the presence of Cl– [45]. Higher voltages and lower humidity, conditions found in
high energy storms in dry locales, promote the greatest yields [45]. Second, reactions
of aerosolized chlorine and oxygen species, energized by ultraviolet light, have
long been known to occur. For example, perchlorate can be formed from reactions
between ozone (O3) and chloride. As a consequence, perchlorate has been proposed
to be a stable sink for chloride in the stratosphere, where because of kinetic stability it
is expected to resist decomposition by photolytic processes [46, 47]. Perchlorate’s
presence in the stratosphere has since been experimentally veriﬁed by single particle
mass spectrometry on research ﬂights at altitudes of up to 19 km [46]. Such atmo-
spheric reactions would be a highly probable source of continuously deposited,
natural, terrestrial perchlorate. Third and ﬁnally, in addition to these atmospheric
sources, localized deposits of perchlorate have been proposed to have been brought to
the Earth’s surface by meteors [28].
2.4
Perchlorate on Mars
In 2008, the Phoenix Lander spacecraft, with the Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL)
onboard, landed on the surface of Mars (Figure 2) [153]. The WCL analyzed
three separate cubic centimeter soil samples for their water-soluble constituents.
Quite stunningly, ClO
4 was found to be their major anionic constituent (0.4–0.6 %
by mass) [48].
Figure 2 Side-by-side images of the Martian surface (left) and Atacama Desert (right). The
Martian surface is rich in perchlorate, as it lacks the action of bacteria which would otherwise
eliminate it. The Atacama Desert’s hyperarid interior is largely lifeless, relatively devoid of
geochemical or hydrological activity, and a surrogate for Mars in NASA training missions. It is
also the only place on Earth where perchlorate has accrued to a signiﬁcant extent. The Martian
image was taken by the Spirit rover and is courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech. The photograph of the
Atacama Desert was freely provided by Dr. Mark Claire of the Blue Marble Space Institute of
Science.

The hyperarid Martian surface environment is not unlike the Atacama Desert or
the dry valleys of the Antarctic, places on earth which have served as Mars
surrogates in preparation for missions and places where perchlorate has also
accumulated. How Martian perchlorate is generated is not currently known.
It could be produced by atmospheric processes similar to those on earth, though
the source of the oxygen atoms (O2, O3, CO2, H2O) is not clear. Mineral-catalyzed
photochemical processes, using chloride and water as chemical ingredients,
have also been proposed and given some Earth-bound experimental support [49].
Such processes would take advantage of the intense UV light permitted by the thin
ozone layer around Mars.
Even if perchlorate production on Mars occurs at a similar or even slower rate
than on Earth, the complete lack of hydrological or biological forces for its removal
would certainly allow for it to accrue on the Martian surface. Whether this
perchlorate could or ever did serve to support Martian microbial life, whether it
could serve as a chemical feedstock for O2 production, and what it tells us about the
chemistry of the Martian atmosphere are all open questions for future discussion
and perhaps even experimental work.

Perchlorate Respiration
3.1
Diversity of Perchlorate-Respiring Microbes
The ﬁrst dissimilatory (i.e., respiratory) perchlorate-reducing bacteria were isolated
in 1996 [42, 43], touching off research both into natural sources of environmental
perchlorate (above) and the origins of perchlorate metabolism. Since 1996, 50
strains using chlorate or perchlorate as respiratory electron acceptors [collectively,
“(per)chlorate”] have been discovered (Figure 3) [50]. The overwhelming majority
of these are β-Proteobacteria isolated from freshwater, mesophilic, neutral-pH
environments [6, 11, 51, 52].
It has been debated whether these species encompass the real diversity of
perchlorate respirers, or whether they merely reﬂect where the light of investigation
has shone most brightly. There is some evidence that the latter phenomenon may
be at work. Sampling in a marine environment, for example, yielded the ﬁrst
ε-Proteobacterial
dissimilatory
perchlorate-respiring
bacterium,
from
the
Arcobacter genus [53]. How far this metabolism extends beyond the Proteobacteria,
into Gram-positive bacteria or Archaea, for example, is not clear, as the current
evidence is incomplete. Moorella perchloratireducens and Sporomusa strain An4
(Gram-positives, phylum Firmicutes) were identiﬁed from an underground
gas storage facility and shown to have perchlorate-reducing activity [54, 55]. Simi-
larly, strains of Biﬁdobacteria (Gram-positives, phylum Actinobacteria) have been
shown to reduce perchlorate. In each case, though reduction of perchlorate was
observed, respiration of the anion has not been veriﬁed nor have the genetics of
52
DuBois and Ojha

reduction been probed [56]. Because the natural atmospheric events leading to
perchlorate production would have existed perhaps deep in prehistory, evidence
of perchlorate reduction was sought – and found – in an ancient organism.

sulfate-reducing environments that resemble conditions on early Earth. This organism
appears to possess both genes encoding a perchlorate reductase enzyme (below) and
the physiological capacity to use perchlorate as a respiratory anion [57].
3.2
Genetics and Genomics
of Perchlorate-Respiring Microbes
Perchlorate-respiring bacteria convert perchlorate to O2 and Cl via two enzymes:
perchlorate reductase (Pcr) and chlorite dismutase (Cld). Pcr is encoded by a four-
gene operon (pcrABCD) that is functionally similar and homologous to the operon
that encodes respiratory nitrate reductase (narGHJI) in diverse bacteria. In some
cases (examples include Ideonella dechloratans [58] and Pseudomonas chloriti-
dismutans AW-1 [59]), bacteria may respire chlorate but not perchlorate.
The responsible enzyme in these organisms is consequently called a chlorate
reductase (Clr). It has been experimentally shown that Pcr enzymes can reduce
chlorate; however, Clr appears to be unable to reduce perchlorate. These differ-
ences in substrate speciﬁcity may reﬂect the far greater kinetic lability of chlorate,
which can in fact be reduced by several enzymes including Nar and selenite
reductase (Ser), as well as abiotically by Fe(II) or Mn(II) [60, 61]. The ultimate
end products of (per)chlorate respiration are water and chlorite. Though the latter
anion could in principle be further reduced to provide yet more respiratory energy,
it is not reduced. Instead, it is simply detoxiﬁed, via the enzyme Cld.
In spite of the similarity of the reactions they catalyze, the Pcr and Clr enzymes
are encoded by distinct genes with separate evolutionary origins. The sequences of
the PcrA and ClrA subunits, where the oxochlorate anions are reduced, place both
enzymes into the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase class (Figure 4). This class
can be further subdivided into types I, II, and III, corresponding to three distinct
phylogenetic clades [62]. The type I enzymes include periplasmic nitrate reductase
(NapA), assimilatory nitrate reductase (NasA), and arsenite oxidase (AsoA). PcrA
and ClrA are both type II enzymes, along with selenate reductase (SerA) and the
dissimilatory/respiratory nitrate reductase (NarG). However, within the type IIs, the
PcrA subunits form their own monophyletic group that is most closely related to
the NarGs. The ClrA subunits, by contrast, are more closely related to SerA [50].
Additionally, the four Clr- and Pcr-encoding genes occur in a different order
relative to one another (pcrABCD versus clrABDC), where the gene ordering is
conserved between Pcr/Nar and Clr/Ser, respectively.
Genomic analyses support the conclusion that perchlorate and chlorate metabolic
pathways are genetically and etiologically different, as well as primed for horizontal
transfer between species. The ﬁrst perchlorate-reducing organism to have its
genome sequenced was Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB [63]. Genome
sequences for Azospira suillum strain PS [64], the α-Proteobacterium Magnetos-
pirillum bellicus strain VDYT [52], Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB [63],
54
DuBois and Ojha

and Dechlorosoma suillum PS [65] have since followed. Similarly, the genomes
of ﬁve chlorate respiring bacteria (Ideonella dechloratans, Pseudomonas sp. strain
PK, Dechloromarinus chlorophilus NSS, Shewanella algae ACDC [66], and
Alicycliphilus denitriﬁcans [67, 68]), have been sequenced [66]. Each set of genomes
has been compared in order to better understand the evolutionary origins of perchlo-
rate and chlorate metabolism, and the relationships between these two [65].
In perchlorate-respiring bacteria, the Pcr- and Cld-encoding genes are located on a
genomic island. In chlorate respirers, the Clr and Cld encoding genes are on a
“composite transposon,” a region of the genome ﬂanked by so-called insertion
sequences. Insertion sequences are hot spots for bacterial evolution, serving as sites
for homologous recombination and plasmid integration. Even among the relatively
small available sample set, the transposon varies in its location (genome versus
plasmid), copy number, and composition.
The cld gene in all of these organisms is, genomically speaking, something of
a rogue. In perchlorate respirers, it appears to assume a number of possible
orientations relative to the pcrABCD operon, and its transcription may be under
separate regulation [69, 70]. Based on incongruence between protein and species
phylogenies, cld genes have been predicted to have undergone horizontal transfer
between species on several occasions [71, 72]. A functional chlorite-degrading
chlorite dismutase protein was isolated, for example, from Candidatus Nitrospira
deﬂuvii: a nitrite-oxidizing bacterium without a (per)chlorate reductase and without

known (per)chlorate-respiring capabilities. Genetic evidence suggests that the cld
gene in this species was transferred from a taxonomically distant (per)chlorate
respirer. The genomic analyses described above suggest that chlorite dismutase
originated in the perchlorate respiratory islands, from which it has likely been
uprooted and transferred (along with peripheral genetic sequences) to the composite
transposons in the chlorate respirers [66]. The movement of a cld gene effectively
completes the chlorate respiratory pathway. Such transfers appear to have happened
on more than one occasion, again even in the relatively small pool of available
genomic sequences.
Some chlorate respirers may have an additional cld gene that is not associated
with the chlorate reductase transposon. These clds form a lineage, sometimes called
“lineage II”, that is closely related to but nonetheless evolutionarily distinct from
the longer, respiration-associated lineage I proteins. Additionally, Proteobacteria
with no known oxochlorate respiratory pathways – for either perchlorate or
chlorate – may also contain a lineage II Cld. The chemical properties and biological
roles of these “Clds” are not clear and are currently under investigation (below).
3.3
(Per)chlorate Reductases
Perchlorate reductases, like nitrate reductases, are molybdenum-dependent
oxo-transferase enzymes. Molybdenum in the protein’s α-subunit is coordinated
to the thiolates of two pterin cofactors. Each pterin, in turn, is connected to
a guanine dinucleotide by a pyrophosphate linkage, and the whole cofactor is
known as bis(MGD)Mo [bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)-molybdenum].
The molybdenum may additionally have a variable number of hydroxide, carbox-
ylate, and cysteine or selenocysteine ligands. In PcrA, the protein-derived ligand is
likely a conserved aspartate. Generally speaking, proteins in this family catalyze the
transfer of an oxo-atom to or from a substrate. The molybdenum is the holder of
two electron equivalents in this transaction, cycling between MoIV and MoVI.
Hence, the complete perchlorate reductase reaction cycle is:

In respiratory pathways, reduction reaction occurs at the end of an electron
transport chain. Passage of electrons to the substrate is used to generate a proton
gradient and, in turn, ATP. Here, perchlorate is initially reduced in a two-electron,
water-producing step to chlorate (eqs 7 and 8). A similar Pcr- or Clr-mediated
two-electron step reduces chlorate to chlorite (eqs 9 and 10). The electrons in each
case come from the electron transport chain embedded in the bacterial inner
56
DuBois and Ojha

membrane. These reducing equivalents ultimately originate from a variety of
carbon sources that the (per)chlorate-respiring bacteria use as food.
The molybdopterin active site is housed in the α-subunit of Pcr, Clr, or Nar,
encoded by PcrA, ClrA or NarG, respectively. Though the subunits are homologs,
PcrA or ClrA are considerably smaller (60–104 kDa versus 104–150 kDa) and
hence distinct from NarG, making it possible to predict from the sequence (even
without computational analysis) that an operon could be involved in oxochlorate
metabolism. PcrA- and ClrA-encoding genes moreover begin with a twin-arginine
signal peptide, which target the Pcr and Clr enzymes for transport to the periplasmic
space in their folded form.
The PcrA, ClrA, and NarG subunits interface with a second, iron-sulfur cluster
containing a β-subunit, encoded by pcrB, clrB, or narH. The purpose of the
β-subunit is to relay electrons from the respiratory electron transport chain to the
α-subunit. Clr and Nar have a further, heme-containing γ-subunit (clrC, narC) that
anchors the whole complex to the inner membrane and serves as an electron conduit
(Table 1). Pcr, by contrast, appears to be a freely diffusing periplasmic enzyme.
Electron equivalents originating from the membrane are predicted to reach the FeS
clusters through a soluble, cytochrome b-containing γ-subunit (pcrC) and electron
transporting mediators [73].
Finally, the δ-subunit of each of these protein complexes (encoded by
pcrD/clrD) is a chaperone involved in maturation of the enzyme and possibly in
insertion of the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor.
3.4
Chlorite Dismutases and Perchlorate Respiration
All bacteria with a functional Pcr or Clr have a cld gene that encodes a bona ﬁde,
functioning chlorite dismutase: that is, a protein that detoxiﬁes chlorite by
converting it to Cl and O2. In the absence of this reaction or some other means

of eliminating chlorite, this end product would accrue to a toxic level. Interestingly,
the only known perchlorate-respiring Archaean, A. fulgidis, is able to overcome
chlorite toxicity even though it lacks a cld gene. How A. fulgidis degrades chlorite is
not known, but abiotic means have been proposed.
The gene encoding the respiration-associated Cld, as described above, is near
to the pcrABCD or clrABDC operon but not necessarily in a static location [66].
The properties of these O2-generating proteins are described in detail in Section 4.
Notably, many species with no known (per)chlorate metabolism possess a cld
gene. Current evidence suggests that these non-respiratory Clds are not efﬁcient
detoxiﬁers of chlorite and that they serve other cellular roles, as discussed below.

4.1.1
Primary Structures: Diversity and Hallmarks of O2 Generation
For an organism to respire chlorate/perchlorate, some means of chlorite degradation
is necessary because chlorite is toxic. However, the presence of a cld gene does not
correlate with either the possession of (per)chlorate reductase encoding genes, or with
the ability to reduce oxochlorates. The “lineage I” and “lineage II” Clds were
described above as two closely related but distinct groups of cld genes found thus
far primarily in Proteobacteria. When a rainbow of microbial genome sequences
began to emerge in earnest in the early 2000s, cld genes could be found in a great
number of them. In fact, cld-family genes have been identiﬁed in highly diverse
microbes from at least 9 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla (Figure 5) [71]. They cluster
into at least three additional monophyletic sequence groups beyond lineages I and II.
The respiration-associated Clds come from lineage I, and these proteins all
rapidly emit O2 when presented with chlorite (Figure 6, Table 2). The well-studied
Cld from Dechloromonas aromatica (DaCld) survives an impressive 20,000 turn-
overs with this often-punishing oxidant before its heme irreversibly lyses.
By contrast, Clds from diverse bacteria beyond the Proteobacterial phylum – for
example, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive pathogen, phylum Firmicutes)
and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (Gram-negative hyperthermophile, phylum
Deinococcus-Thermus) have no and very little chlorite-degrading capacity, respec-
tively, and their parent organisms do not respire oxochlorates [74, 75]. So, do all
Clds from non-respirers fail to produce O2? Not exactly. Clds from two nitrite-
oxidizing, non-(per)chlorate-respiring bacteria were shown to convert chlorite to
dioxygen [71, 76], and they illustrate two known types of exceptions. The ﬁrst of
these, the Cld from Candidatus Nitrospira deﬂuvii, is clearly a lineage I Cld that
appears to have arrived in the N. deﬂuvii genome via horizontal transfer from a
perchlorate respiring organism. The environmental selection pressures promoting
its transfer and retention in its new host are not yet understood. The second of these
is the Cld from Nitrobacter winogradskyi, which is representative of the lineage II
58
DuBois and Ojha

Clds that are found predominantly or perhaps exclusively in Proteobacteria. Though
the lineage II clds occur in genomes independently of (per)chlorate reductase genes,
the N. winogradskyi Cld and potentially other members of this group (including the
Cld from the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae) can produce O2 from chlorite.

however, is sharply limited. Hence, while chlorite catalysis is observable, the
catalyst is not robust, suggesting that chlorite decomposition may not be the
biological function of the lineage II proteins.

This conclusion is consistent with the lack of a known biological imperative
for chlorite detoxiﬁcation by their parent organisms, although it is possible that
these Clds catalyze detoxiﬁcation of chlorite produced by Nar-mediated chlorate
(ClO3
) reduction. In short, the available evidence suggests that only the respiration-
associated Clds – encoded by genes on perchlorate reductase islands or composite
transposons near pcrABCD/clrABDC operons, or recently mobilized from such –
efﬁciently convert chlorite to O2 and Cl. Cld homologs from outside this relatively
small group are biochemically distinct and appear to serve other biological roles.
Sequence alignments including lineage I, II, and the more taxonomically broad
Clds show that the family as a whole is quite sequence-diverse (Figure 7, Table 3).
Only three amino acids are strictly conserved family-wide. These include the
proximal histidine ligand to the heme iron (H171 in DaCld, with residue numbering
reﬂecting the structurally characterized mature form of the protein lacking the SecB
tag earmarking the protein for secretion to the periplasm) [4]. They also include
a tryptophan near the porphyrin binding site (Trp155) and a proline residue
important for maintaining the protein’s fold (Pro148). This sequence diversity,
the taxonomic breadth of organisms containing the gene, and the presence of
several monophyletic groups of Clds suggests an ancient origin for cld in which
divergence of the sequence occurs at pace with speciation events. The exception to
this pattern comes, of course, for the heavily traveled cld genes associated with
oxochlorate respiration [65, 66, 71, 77].
What sequence features distinguish the O2-generating Clds from their non-O2-
generating counterparts? There are at least three (Figure 7, Table 3). First, in
oxochlorate-respiring bacteria, the Cld-encoding sequence is preceded by a SecB
peptide, signaling transport of the protein to the periplasm in its unfolded, heme-
free form. Clds from the non-respirers, by contrast, are cytoplasmic. Second, both
the longer lineage I Clds from oxochlorate respirers and the shorter lineage II Clds
share a conserved arginine residue in the pocket above the heme plane. Proteins
from each of these groups have been experimentally conﬁrmed to produce O2
rapidly, even if the lineage I proteins are considerably more robust (i.e., higher
numbers of turnovers). The distal Arg residue is not conserved in the various
non-O2-producing branches of the phylogeny depicted in Figure 5, changing for
example to serine
(Euryarchaeota), glutamine (Firmicutes), or
asparagine
(Actinobacteria). Surprisingly, the arginine can be mutagenically substituted with
an asparagine in DaCld without completely abrogating activity with chlorite [78].
However, the Cld from Staphylococcus aureus (phylum Firmicutes), which has a
distal glutamine residue in the analogous position, has no measurable chlorite-
degrading activity. Finally, a second tryptophan near the heme’s periphery
(Trp156) and two residues from a triad of hydrophobic amino acids above the
heme plane (Leu185 and Phe200) are strictly conserved among all Clds.
The tryptophan appears to be critical for maintaining the bound heme as well as
the protein’s oligomeric state [79], and hydrophobicity in the distal pocket may be
essential for stabilizing reaction intermediates (see Section 4.2.)

4.1.2
Heme-Binding Domain
The heme-binding domain of Clds consists of a series of α-helices lining the
proximal side of the heme plane and a row of β-sheets over the distal, open
coordination position. The iron is ligated by a histidine residue that is strictly
conserved throughout the Cld family (Figure 6). In the full length Clds – that is,
all Clds except those in lineage II – the protein monomer contains two mutually
homologous domains, each about 140 amino acids in length. These resemble one
another in secondary structure, with the exception of an added α-helix in the
N-terminal domain, and are linked by a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry.
The extra helix, the lack of a strictly conserved histidine, and a slightly more
compact structure may be responsible for the failure of heme to bind in the
N-terminal domain [4, 76, 80–82].
Heme is typically found in predominantly α-helical environments, such as in
the globins, cytochrome P450, catalases, and peroxidases. Hence, the Cld heme-
binding domain at ﬁrst seemed somewhat unusual. However, it is now clear that the
mixed α-helical/β-sheet domain of Clds is shared by a very large structural super-
family of proteins, many of which derive from microbes and only a small fraction of
which associate with heme [75, 83]. Subfamilies range from quite close to Clds
in sequence (and therefore ancestry) to relatively distant. At least two subfamilies in
addition to the Clds are known to interact with heme. They are catalytically
dissimilar to Clds, in spite of their identical heme-binding architecture and mutually
conserved residues in the active site. The ﬁrst subfamily contains the bacterial
IsdG-type heme oxygenases that oxidatively cleave heme as a substrate, releasing
the iron for cellular use [84]. Unlike Clds, the IsdG-family proteins have just one
domain per monomer. Two heme-binding monomers come together to form a
dimer that resembles the DaCld bidomain monomer [85]. The heme in IsdI (from
Staphylococcus aureus) also assumes a different orientation than in the Clds and is
signiﬁcantly distorted from planarity. Structural distortion of the tetrapyrrole is
known to be important for catalysis [86].
The dye-decoloring peroxidases (DyPs) from bacteria and fungi form a second,
diverse subfamily. These proteins are evolutionarily quite distant from the Clds,
sharing as low as 6 % identity [83]. However, they are structurally very similar,
having the same bidomain monomer in which only the C-terminal domain binds
heme [87]. In the DyPs, however, the heme is ﬂipped relative to its orientation in
the Clds, placing its propionic acid side chains in a very different chemical
environment. This again illustrates the remarkable versatility with which this
protein domain is known to interact with heme [83]. One of the propionates is
able to form a hydrogen bond to the conserved distal arginine. These features and
the presence of a distal aspartic acid distinguish the DyPs from the Clds and may be
important for their distinct chemistry [87, 88]. DyPs efﬁciently activate H2O2 to
form high-valent iron-oxo intermediates which catalyze the one-electron oxidation
of substrates. Clds do not, likely because they lack a base for deprotonating H2O2
and thereby activating it for binding to Fe(III) [89].
64
DuBois and Ojha

4.1.3
Active Site
Like heme proteins that mediate O2 transport [90], gas sensing [91–95], and
peroxidase catalysis, Clds have a proximal histidine ligand to the heme (Figure 8,
left). A glutamic or aspartic acid forms a hydrogen bond to the proximal histidine’s
other, unligated nitrogen. Such hydrogen bonding is expected to increase the
anionic (histidinate) character of the ligand in peroxidases, making the Fe(III)
iron more electron-rich and therefore capable of donating signiﬁcant electron
density toward scission of a peroxide ligand in trans [96, 97]. However, resonance
Raman shows that the histidine ligand in Clds, like in the gas-binding proteins, is
neutral in character [98]. Also on the proximal side of the heme plane are two
tryptophan residues, one strictly conserved throughout the entire Cld family (W155,
DaCld numbering) and the other conserved among O2-producing lineage I Clds and
related Clds from lineage II (W156). A third tryptophan (Trp227) is not strictly
conserved, but is connected to the proximal histidine through a hydrogen bonding
network. Finally, two tyrosine residues (Tyr118, Tyr177) are conserved among the
lineage I and II Clds. Tyr118 is connected to a propionate side chain of the DaCld
heme by a hydrogen bond. From a structural perspective, either Tyr118 or Trp227
have a direct conduit to the heme and could therefore in principle stabilize radical
intermediates, as described below.
The distal side of the heme plane (Figure 8, right) has several unique and
likely functionally important features. Notably, there are no distal basic residues
(histidine, aspartate, glutamate) in any of the Clds. A distal base is essential for
rapid H2O2 activation in the well-studied peroxidases [99–101]. As mentioned
above, there is instead an arginine directly above the heme plane of all lineage I
and II Clds, changing to a serine or glutamine in most other Clds. This residue has
no amino acid hydrogen-bonding partner in DaCld or in any available crystal

structures of O2-evolving Clds, and is instead found hydrogen-bonded to the Fe(III)
heme ligand (water/hydroxide, nitrite, thiocyanate). Adjacent to the distal arginine
are three hydrophobic residues: Leu185, Thr198, Phe200. Although the exact
identity of the residues can vary, a hydrophobic triad is strictly conserved at these
positions. They form a low, hydrophobic ceiling above the porphyrin plane in what
is overall a fairly hydrophobic pocket.

prepared mainly by structural genomics consortia, and hence the protein expres-
sion/puriﬁcation conditions may not have supplied sufﬁcient heme. However, it has
also been observed that the Cld from Staphylococcus aureus, which does not
convert chlorite to O2, binds heme with very low afﬁnity and is actually somewhat
difﬁcult to prepare in a heme-bound state [75]. Intrinsically low afﬁnity may be
responsible for the failure to capture the Cld structures in the heme-bound form. By
the same token, it is notable that these proteins are stable enough to form crystals in
the apo/heme-free form, though solution measurements have indicated that the
apo-Clds from N. winogradskyi and Candidatus N. deﬂuvii are more prone to
denaturation than their holo-counterparts [102, 103].

Tertiary Structures and Oligomerization States
We conclude the discussion of Cld structures by noting the diversity of
oligomerization states in which the Cld domain can be found in X-ray crystal
structures. All full-length Clds (whether or not they catalyze the chlorite decom-
position reaction) form a biochemically unusual homopentameric structure in
which the heme-binding domains associate with each other along one face of the
pentamer (Figure 9a). Uniquely in DaCld, each monomer-monomer interface has a
Ca2+ ion ligated by a strictly conserved aspartic acid (Asp192). The pentameric

shape of the complex leaves an open, solvent-ﬁlled channel in the middle of
the protein, the function of which (if any) is not clear. It is also unknown whether
the pentameric form is physiologically relevant, although it represents the stable
solution state of the pure protein. Full-length Clds in the pentameric state with heme
bound and a conserved arginine in the distal pocket are moreover the most efﬁcient
catalysts in the conversion of chlorite to O2 and Cl [103].
By contrast, the short-length Cld from N. winogradskyi crystallizes as a dimer
with a completely different monomer interface (Figure 9b) [76, 82]. This leaves the
heme signiﬁcantly more solvent exposed than in the pentameric structures
(Figure 9a). The more open active site may be responsible for the signiﬁcantly
lower stability of the protein’s heme. Though NwCld is capable of producing O2
from chlorite, catalysis is limited by chlorite-dependent degradation of the heme,
which appears to occur at much smaller concentrations of chlorite than in DaCld.
The bacterial heme oxygenases (IsdG, IsdI) and DyPs share the heme binding
domain structure of Clds but, as described above, are signiﬁcantly different in
sequence. The bidomain DyPs, unlike Clds, furthermore form head-to-tail dimers,
where the C-terminal heme domain of one monomer interacts structurally with the
N-terminal heme-free domain of the other. DyP structures may form independent
dimers (Figure 9c) or a crystallographic trimer-of-dimers (Figure 9d and e).

By contrast, the monodomain IsdG-like proteins form independent dimers in which
both monomers bind heme.
This diversity of oligomeric structures demonstrates that the heme-binding
domain is structurally capable not only of accommodating heme in multiple
orientations, but of interacting in a variety of different ways with partner proteins.
Such intrinsic ﬂexibility in their protein-protein interactions could be important for
the biological functions or technological applications of diverse Clds.
4.2
Reactivity and Mechanism
4.2.1
Diversity of Reactions Catalyzed by Chlorite Dismutases
Clds catalyze at least three reactions: O–O bond formation, one-electron oxidations
(peroxidase chemistry), and heme oxidation.
O–O bond formation from chlorite is the principal reaction catalyzed by full
length Clds from (per)chlorate-respiring bacteria. As described above, these “bona
ﬁde” Clds are characterized by their pentameric oligomerization state, bidomain
monomer structure, and possession of a distal pocket arginine in the heme-binding
domain. They constitute a relatively small minority of all the sequenced Clds from
taxonomically diverse sources. The small dimeric Clds have nearly the same active
site structure as their pentameric homologs, including the distal arginine and
the surrounding hydrophobic residues. These Clds also catalyze rapid O–O joining
in spite of the lack of a known biological imperative by their host organisms for
eliminating chlorite. However, the limited number of turnovers their hemes can
sustain suggests that chlorite may not be their natural substrate [76, 104].
Whether short or long, the O2-producing proteins also appear to be capable of
catalyzing peroxidase-type one-electron oxidation reactions when either H2O2 or a
peracid is the oxidant [89, 104]. A complete peroxidase reaction cycle has been
documented for DaCld, as described below. Catalysis of this reaction is very slow
and the number of achievable turnovers per heme limited, consistent with the
assumption that peroxidase chemistry is not the biological function of these Clds.
Studies of the peroxidase reaction nonetheless have shed light on the basic chemical
and biological capabilities of Clds and are therefore of interest [89].
Finally, Clds, like many heme-dependent oxidation catalysts, facilitate the
oxidant-dependent degradation of their own hemes. The redox-stability of the
heme in Clds is extraordinarily variable. DaCld sustains ~20,000 turnovers with
chlorite, per heme [105]. The dimeric Cld from Klebsiella pneumoniae sustains
only ~2–3,000 turnovers under similar conditions [104]. The heme in the Cld from
Staphylococcus aureus is completely destroyed by less than ﬁve equivalents of
chlorite, without measurable production of O2 [75]. Whether heme destruction
serves a biological function in any of these proteins is not clear. However, it does
seem to be the principal catalytic pathway followed by the S. aureus Cld (and likely
by related pentameric Clds from non-oxochlorate-respiring bacteria) in the
presence of a series of oxidants (chlorite, H2O2, peracids).

4.2.2
Possible Pathways for O–O Formation
There are a number of possible pathways for O2 production from chlorite.
Early efforts with DaCld truncated the list by demonstrating that (i) O2 is produced
stoichiometrically with ClO
2 degraded [105]; (ii) all of the emitted O2 derives from
chlorite, even in the presence of 18O–labeled water [106]. These results strongly
favored mechanisms where the two oxygen atoms of O2 derive from the same
molecule of ClO
2 . Alternative mechanisms where chlorite acts as an oxygen atom
or one-electron donor to the Fe(III) heme produce highly protein-reactive leaving
groups (ClO, ClO2) [107, 108] that would have to re-react quantitatively at the
heme site to maintain the observed 1ClO
2 :1O2 stoichiometry. They would more-
over have to do so without undergoing exchange of their oxygen atoms with 18OH2.
Hence, the four possible mechanisms by which a single molecule of chlorite can be
effectively rearranged to generate Cl and O2, depicted in Figure 10, are preferred.
In pathway (1), a single molecule of chlorite binds Fe(III) in a bidentate, η2
mode, and formation of O2 occurs in a concerted fashion without any intermediate
transfer of electrons or atoms to the iron. In pathway (2), electron transfer from

chlorite to the Fe(III) heme, depicted here as an inner-sphere process, yields the
Fe(II) porphyrin and chlorine dioxide (ClO2). This reaction (eqn. 11) is thermody-
namically favorable [109] and known to be catalyzed by certain synthetic
metalloporphyrins (described below):

Oxygen atom transfer from chlorine dioxide to the Fe(II) iron would yield a ferryl
(FeIV¼O) heme. This could recombine with the released chlorine oxide to make a
formally Fe(III)-OOCl species, spontaneously breaking down to yield Cl and O2.
The Fe(II) Cld may also react with chlorite to give O2, which is also depicted in
Figure 10.
Pathways (3) and (4) both begin with the formation of a Fe(III) heme/
chlorite complex. This complex is analogous to the Fe(III)-peroxy species
(Fe(III)-OOH) formed as the initial intermediate in peroxidase reactions, known
as Compound 0 [110]. The distal histidine of classical peroxidases removes the
proton from H2O2 (pKa ¼ 12) to yield the peroxy anion, which binds avidly to
Fe(III). Because the hypochlorous acid/chlorite pKa is quite low (1.72), base
catalysis would not be needed to form the analogous Fe(III)-chlorito complex.
Donation of two electrons from the Fe(III) heme leads to heterolytic scission
of the coordinated O–Cl bond (pathway 3) and formation of a formally Fe(V)¼O
intermediate.
This
intermediate,
observed
pervasively
in
biological
heme
chemistry, is known as Compound I. Electronically, it is described as a ferryl
(Fe(IV)¼O) that is exchange-coupled to a radical on the non-innocent porphyrin
ligand. Because loss of an electron occurs without concomitant loss of a proton, the
resulting porphyrin radical is a cation (porphyrin• +). Unlike the parent tetrapyrrole,
porphyrin• + is not aromatic. Hence, the porphyrin’s visible Soret absorbance band
is signiﬁcantly diminished in intensity in porphyrin•+, providing a simple indicator
of the possible presence of Compound I. The oxygen atom in Compound I is
capable of removing electrons or an electron/proton pair (hydrogen atom) from a
substrate, thereby becoming reduced to the ferryl-porphyrin intermediate (Fe(IV)¼O
or Fe(III)-OH), also known as Compound II [111]. A good nucleophile may also
attack the electron-deﬁcient oxygen of Compound I. The oxygen atom of hypo-
chlorite, particularly in its anionic/deprotonated form, is nucleophilic and could
attack Compound I to yield the same Fe(III)-peroxychlorite intermediate proposed
in pathway (1).
Alternatively, the Fe(III)-chlorite complex could react in a one-electron fashion
to give the products of heterolytic O–Cl bond cleavage: Fe(IV)¼O and the ClO•
(chlorine monoxide) radical. These two would need to re-react, once again to form a
Fe(III) species with an O–O(Cl) bond (pathway 4). Chlorine monoxide is presum-
ably a highly reactive species, perhaps not dissimilar to the hydroxyl radical. It has
been described in atmospheric chemistry models but is not a known biological
molecule.
70
DuBois and Ojha

There is no precedent for pathway (1) using either synthetic or biological
catalysts. In fact, there are very few reported crystal structures for metals bound
to chlorite, and none in either the through chloride or bidentate O,O-η2 modes.
While not a strict necessity, either of these binding modes and particularly the
latter would seem to be the most logical for catalyzing the concerted formation of
O2 and Cl. By contrast, there are several direct precedents for parts of both
mechanisms (2) and (3). The two long-proposed mechanisms for O–O joining in
PSII and in synthetic water-splitting catalysts, for example, involve two oxygen
atoms poised to react via either nucleophilic or radical processes [1, 2, 112,
113]. Mechanisms that are chemically analogous to pathways (3) and (4) have
also been proposed for Fe(III) porphyrin-mediated isomerization of peroxynitrite
(ONOO) to nitrate [114–117]. An Fe(III)-coordinated ONOO anion could
undergo heterolytic O–N bond cleavage to yield Compound I and the anionic
leaving group (nitrite). Nitrite would then act as the nucleophile, attacking Com-
pound I to form nitrate. Alternatively, homolytic O–N bond cleavage would yield
Compound II and the neutral, radical leaving group (NO2). Radical joining of NO2
and the ferryl oxygen then lead to the Fe(III) porphyrin and NO
3 .
4.2.3
Catalytic Efﬁciency
Clds that produce O2 tend to do so very efﬁciently. Values for kcat/KM for several
Clds are listed in Table 2, and many are near the diffusion limit. The rapidity with
which O2 is produced has made Clds useful generators of O2 for stopped ﬂow
studies, where oxygen gas is produced within a few milliseconds in an initial
mixing experiment between Cld in one syringe and chlorite in another [118].
The oxygenated solution is mixed with a third, concentrated solution of the
reduced/anaerobic enzyme species of interest, and the subsequent reaction is
monitored. Dioxygen is produced in this way at concentrations of up to 9 mM
(25 C, neutral pH) without observed visible light scattering in a stopped ﬂow
reaction chamber, which would be indicative of bubbling. It has been postulated
that the solution remains transiently supersaturated over the very short time scale of
the initial, O2-producing mix, although the process of bubble growth has not been
explicitly monitored over time.
Having the means to produce very large concentrations of O2 with rapidity has
allowed an important barrier to be surmounted. Namely, many intermediates in
reactions between reduced biomolecules and O2 cannot be observed because they
decay more rapidly than they form. However, the second-order rate of their
production can be enhanced by increasing [O2]. Using DaCld in this way, that is,
as a reagent, has indeed yielded impressive results in cases previously limited by the
rapid decay of the intermediate [118]. Other biotechnological applications of the
reaction are currently under development.

4.2.4
Reaction Intermediates
While efﬁciency is critical for a detoxiﬁcation enzyme and for the experiments
described above, it can be the enemy of mechanistic studies. It has thus far not been
possible to detect intermediates in the Cld/ClO
2 reaction (e.g., Compounds 0, I, II)
via stopped ﬂow spectrophotometry. Hence, the Cld mechanism has not been
monitored directly. By the same token, addition of a variety of colorimetric
reagents in the presence of DaCld during turnover with chlorite – small peroxidase
substrates such as guaiacol or ascorbate, or the chlorination substrate monochloro-
dimedone (MCD) – has not resulted in observable side reactivity [105, 119]. This
suggests that potential intermediates such as ClO2 (ε359 nm ¼ 1.23 mM1 cm1)
[120], ClO, or possibly ClO•, any of which would react with MCD, either are not
generated or cannot be accessed by MCD. The oxidation of molecules like guaiacol
or ascorbate by potential intermediates Compound I or II is likewise not observed.
However, DaCld can oxidize the peroxidase substrates guaiacol, ascorbate,
and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid if either peroxide or
peracetic acid is the oxidant. Moreover, the transient reactions of DaCld with
these oxidants have been examined [89]. These experiments showed that oxygen
atom transfer from the peracid donor is very rapid and leads to the formation of
Compound I, even in the presence of just one equivalent of oxidant. Hence, while it
remains uncertain whether Compound I is an intermediate on the regular reaction
pathway with chlorite, it is clear that the enzyme readily forms this species in
the presence of another anionic oxygen atom donor that is thermodynamically
predisposed toward oxygen atom transfer. These two donors are not identical,
however. Unlike chlorite, for which the leaving group is relatively basic and
therefore nucleophilic (hypochlorite, pKa ¼ 7.5), peracetic acid leaves behind a
much less nucleophilic acetate ion (pKa ¼ 4.5). The reaction between the Fe(III)
heme and chlorite would be expected to be catalyzed by a proton donor or positive
charge that could stabilize the leaving group. The distal arginine has been proposed
to fulﬁll this role, stabilizing hypochlorite in its anionic form and priming it for
re-reaction with the oxygen atom of a hypothetical Compound I.
Interestingly, the actual Compound I formed in the reaction between peracetic
acid and Fe(III) DaCld reacts avidly with peroxidase substrates [89]. Under stopped
ﬂow conditions, a full peroxidase catalytic cycle is observed, with one equivalent of
a one-electron donor (ascorbate) forming Compound II and the second returning the
intermediate to the Fe(III) form:

These results demonstrate that DaCld’s Compound I can access peroxidase-like
substrates, which in real peroxidase enzymes are known to bind in different
locations above and adjacent to the heme plane [121].
By contrast, H2O2 reacts much more slowly with Fe(III) DaCld than peracetic
acid and, rather than producing Compound I, the only observed spectroscopic
changes following the reaction correspond to heme oxidation. This observation is
consistent with the Clds’ lack of a distal pocket base. A distal histidine is absolutely
required for rapid Compound I formation in the well-studied plant peroxidases
[122–125]. When this residue is mutated to an aliphatic amino acid, the rate of
Compound I formation slows by ﬁve orders of magnitude. In short, DaCld can be a
very effective peroxidase, but only in the presence of an acidic oxygen atom donor
to the Fe(III) heme, for which a distal base is not required.
The DaCld Compound I intermediate is not long-lived. It spontaneously
converts to a ferryl without a coupled porphyrin cation radical. This conversion
becomes more rapid at higher pH. The relative instability of Compound I is
consistent with the generation of O2 from a single molecule of chlorite. Namely,
if Compound I is an intermediate on the O2 production pathway, it may be too short-
lived to react with oxygen-atom donors that are not already in the vicinity of the
ferryl. Indeed, a Compound I species prepared in the stopped ﬂow did not react with
exogenously supplied ClO/HClO to form O2, as the reaction appears to be
kinetically out-competed by decay of the Compound I intermediate [89]. Though
the pathway has not been studied, Compound I’s breakdown has been presumed to
occur via the conserved tyrosines that ring (and in one case form hydrogen bonds
with) the heme [79].
Finally, although oxidation of guaiacol/ascorbate or chlorination of MCD is not
observed during DaCld/chlorite turnover, the peroxidase substrates increase (~10-
fold) the number of molecules of chlorite that DaCld can decompose before it
irreversibly inactivates. The high valent intermediates are returned to the Fe(III)
state and hence to activity with chlorite by these substrates. A similar type of
“rescue” is likewise observed in other heme proteins [126–128]. This suggests
that Compounds I, II, or both are intermediates on the pathway to whatever limits
the catalytic lifetime of Clds (see below.) By contrast, MCD has no such rescuing
effect, suggesting either that diffusible O/Cl species are not produced or are not
appreciably responsible for substrate-dependent inactivation of DaCld.
4.2.5
Structure-Activity Relationships: Highlights
The active site of the typical bona ﬁde, chlorite-degrading Cld was discussed
above in terms of what it is; it is also worthwhile to consider what it is not.
Unlike peroxidases, which characteristically have a histidine-arginine pair in their
distal pockets, Clds possess an arginine as the sole conserved, polar residue.
The distal histidine is critical for peroxidase function as described above, acting
as a base to deprotonate H2O2 and then as an acid toward the resulting Fe(III)-OOH
(Compound 0) intermediate to generate Compound I and water. Such proton
3

motions are critical for the rapid formation of both Compound 0 and Compound I in
other heme proteins that activate O2 or H2O2. Fe(III) Clds lack both a distal basic
residue and a recognizable proton conduit to the heme iron. Perhaps not surpris-
ingly, Clds bind anionic CN and CH3(C¼O)COO (surrogates for OOH) much
faster than protonated HCN or H2O2 [104]. DaCld also rapidly forms Compound I
following reaction with peracetic acid but not H2O2 [89]. In short, Clds lack the
necessary machinery for efﬁciently binding and activating peroxide, and this colors
what they can and cannot efﬁciently do with biological oxidants.
By contrast, Clds readily bind anions, including the substrate chlorite. Here, the
distal arginine plays a key role. In multiple crystal structures, it forms a hydrogen
bond to the axial ligand bound to the Fe(III) iron, from which it is separated by ~3 Å
[4, 76, 80, 82]. Notably, the arginine has no identiﬁable hydrogen bonding partners
among either the active site amino acids or the heme propionates, though an
Arg-propionate interaction is present in some DyPs [83]. DaCld, in fact, does not
crystalize in the absence of a heme ligand, possibly in part because the motion of
this residue would otherwise remain unrestrained. Resonance Raman experiments
support a model where the arginine side chain interacts with axially-bound distal
ligands and assumes different orientations (“in” or “out,” relative to the heme
plane) as a function of pH [78, 98]. In solution, substitution of the arginine with
neutral glutamine by mutagenesis results in a strongly diminished kcat/KM(chlorite)
and in a loss of afﬁnity for anions [78]. This indicates that arginine is indeed critical
for stabilizing the Michaelis complex, presumed to be a Compound 0-like
Fe(III)-chlorito species [78].
The distal arginine is also sufﬁcient for promoting rapid, heterolytic cleavage of
the peracid O–O bond and stabilizing the resulting Compound I intermediate
[89]. Similar functions have been attributed to the distal arginine in classical
peroxidases, though in conjunction with an anionic proximal ligand to the heme
iron. In peroxidases, anionic or histidinate character in this ligand is understood to
add electron density to the Fe(III) and to consequently support heterolytic cleavage
of a bond coordinated in trans. As described by the classic “push-pull” model of
peroxidase catalysis, the electron-rich proximal ligand supplies a “push” toward
cleaving a coordinated O–O bond, while the distal arginine supplies a concurrent
“pull” [96, 124, 129]. The imidazole ring of the histidine gains anionic character
via hydrogen bonding to an aspartate or glutamate. Though DaCld has such a
His-Glu hydrogen bond, resonance Raman showed the proximal ligand to be
neutral in character [98]. O–O bond cleavage is relatively rapid in DaCld in spite
of the nature of the protein-derived ligand on the proximal side of the heme iron,
suggesting that the distal pocket’s “pull” alone is enough. The fact that DaCld
readily cleaves the O–O bond of coordinated peracetate ion also suggests that, in
principle, it should be able to heterolytically cleave the O–Cl bond of a bound
chlorite with similar avidity.
The mobility of the arginine could be important for an additional, important
function: stabilizing the hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (aqueous pKa ¼ 7.5)
formed when the O–Cl bond of chlorite is broken. Nucleophilic attack of the
leaving group on Compound I should be signiﬁcantly more avid for the
74
DuBois and Ojha

deprotonated hypochlorite than for hypochlorous acid, as described above.
The positive charge of the arginine could locally lower the pKa for the anion/acid
pair, stabilizing the hypochlorite. It could also steer the hypochlorite into an optimal
position for nucleophilic attack on Compound I.
Finally, the distal arginine could not manage to be such a key player were it
not for a supporting cast of conserved, hydrophobic residues surrounding it.
These residues constitute a sterically conﬁned, chemically unreactive low ceiling
over the heme plane [4]. Such an enclosed environment seems ideal for enforcing
the recombination of a hypochlorite leaving group with Compound I.
4.2.6
Heme and Protein Stability in Diverse Chlorite
Dismutase Family Proteins
The pentameric O2-evolving DaCld catalyzes ~20,000 turnovers (per heme) before
irreversibly inactivating. The same number of chlorite equivalents completely
eliminates the heme chromophore [105]. This suggests that oxidative destruction
of the heme is responsible for the observed irreversible inactivation. Indeed, heme
scission is a common side effect of oxidative catalysis: playing with matches will
eventually cause even a robustly designed protein to get burned.
The mechanism of heme decomposition has not been studied. It has been
observed, however, that far fewer turnovers are sustained by structurally distinct
Clds [76]. The dimeric Cld from Klebsiella pneumoniae, for example, contains a
distal arginine and catalyzes the chlorite to O2 conversion with steady state param-
eters similar to those measured for DaCld. However, the lifetime of the enzyme is
clearly shorter; the measured turnover number is only 2,000–3,000 per heme [104].
The pentameric Cld from Staphylococcus aureus has a glutamine in place of the
distal arginine. Its heme disappears following incubation with fewer than ﬁve
equivalents of chlorite, and no O2 evolution from this protein is observed [75].
The structural features leading to the great disparity in heme stability across the Cld
family are not understood.

Synthetic and Biochemical Models

Chlorite as Reagent with Related Synthetic
Metalloporphyrins
Quite apart from Clds and O2 generation, NaOCl and NaClO2 have an illustrious
history as reagents in metalloporphyrin chemistry. Like iodosylbenzene, organic
peracids (RCO3H), and KHSO5, the oxochlorates have been used as so-called
“shunt” reagents: oxygen atom donors that, unlike O2, do not require the input of
a pair of activating electrons from the catalyst. Such shunt reagents have been used
3

extensively in studies of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and their synthetic
mimics [130–132]. They have also been used in studies of peroxidases and heme
oxygenases, where the oxygen-atom transfers to a Fe(III) heme center to yield
Compound I. The same intermediate can equivalently be reached by the addition of
O2, three electrons, and one proton to a Fe(II) heme (P450), or peroxide minus one
proton to the Fe(III) heme (peroxidases), with water as the leaving group.
Motivated by the goals of understanding and possibly mimicking P450
chemistry, Collman et al. were the ﬁrst to describe O2 evolution from synthetic
Mn(III)porphyrin catalysts and ClO
2 in non-aqueous media [133]. O2 production
occurred as a side reaction to a more P450-like process: the oxidation of unactivated
alkanes (e.g., cyclohexane), which were converted in a two-electron process
to alcohols and in a four-electron process to ketones. Notably, the turnover numbers
using chlorite were >40-fold higher than if other oxygen-atom donors were used,
and the ketone/alcohol ratio was at least double. These results suggested that
chlorite was acting as something other than a simple oxygen-atom donor to the
manganese. Further investigation then showed that radical trapping agents inhibited
turnover, indicating that the Mn(III)/chlorite system acted as a radical initiator.
A two-pathway scheme was proposed to explain the observed oxidations of
cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (Figure 11) [132]. In the ﬁrst
pathway, a Mn(III)/chlorite-derived species was proposed to generate a cyclohexyl
radical by hydrogen-atom (H•) abstraction. The organic radical then combined with
O2 to form a peroxyl radical adduct. The reaction of two such C6H11-OO• species
would then lead to the formation of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and, notably, O2.
A radical process helped explain the observation of ketone products, which were
shown not to arise from the oxidation of alcohols formed initially as precursors.
In the second proposed pathway, oxygen atom transfer from chlorite to the man-
ganese(III)porphyrin catalyst (via heterolytic Cl–O bond cleavage) was proposed to
yield a formal Mn(V)¼O species and ClO as the leaving group. The high valent
Mn(V)¼O could then react via a more conventional, P450-like rebound mechanism
to form the hydroxylation product:
Mn V
ð Þ¼O þ C6H6 ! Mn IV
ð
ÞOH þ C6H
5 ! C6H5OH þ Mn III
ð
Þ
ð15Þ
In addition to the two alkane-oxidizing pathways, simple, metal-catalyzed
decomposition of chlorite by two routes was also observed. In the ﬁrst, Cl and
O2 were produced. Though a mechanism was not explicitly offered, it is possible
that Mn(V)¼O and Cl combined in the same manner proposed for the enzymatic/
Cld reaction. The second pathway led to conversion of chlorite to chlorate and
chloride in a 3:2:1 ratio:
3 ClO
2 ! 2 ClO
3 þ Cl
ð16Þ
Because the manganese catalysts are inert toward chlorate, it persisted here as a
dead-end product.

DuBois and Ojha

The laboratory of Abu-Omar subsequently investigated O2 generation from
metalloporphyrin/chlorite systems as the target reaction rather than as a side
process [134–136]. Water-soluble iron porphyrin complexes with different aryl
groups at the four meso positions were studied (Figure 12) as models for Clds.
The p-sulfonatophenyl- and N,N,N-trimethylanilinium-substituted Fe(III) porphyrins
led primarily to the same kind of chlorite-to-chlorate disproportionation observed by
Collman et al. (eqn. 16) [133]. This mechanism of the reaction was studied in some
detail, and shown to occur via the initial formation of an Fe(IV)¼O(porphyrin•+)
(Compound I) intermediate. Compound I was proposed to comproportionate with an
aqua-Fe(III)porphyrin, resulting in a pair of Fe(IV)–OH(porphyrin) (Compound II)
species. Compound II would then transfer its oxygen atom to chlorite, generating
chlorate and the two-electron reduction product of the catalyst, Fe(II)porphyrin.
The Fe(II)porphyrin thus formed can react with both chlorite and hypochlorite,
heterolytically
cleaving
their
Cl–O
bonds
and

reactive
Fe(IV)–OH(porphyrin).
Though the ﬁrst two iron porphyrins did not produce O2 from chlorite, the ﬂuori-
nated analog of one of them, [Fe(III)(TF4TMAP)](OTf)5, did in 18 % yield
Figure 11 Reactions of Mn(III)porphyrin complexes (Por ¼ porphyrin and L ¼ t-butyl-pyridine)
with chlorite and cyclohexane, where the use of chlorite as a P450-like “shunt” oxidant was tested.
In pathway (1), an unknown Mn/chlorite intermediate forms a cyclohexyl radical. This reacts with
O2, either from air or produced from chlorite via pathway (3). Coupling of two peroxyl radicals
ultimately leads to equimolar cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and O2. Pathway (2) begins with the
formation of a Mn(V)¼O species via oxygen atom transfer from chlorite. This intermediate
extracts a hydrogen atom from cyclohexane, forming the cyclohexyl radical and Mn(IV)–OH.
Mn(IV)–OH and the radical recombine to yield the Mn(III)(Por)Cl starting material and
cyclohexanol product. Finally, pathway (3) illustrates direct decomposition of chlorite to yield
chloride and dioxygen, and pathway (4) shows its disproportionation. Scheme adapted from [133].

[OTf¼ triﬂate, TF4TMAP ¼ 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(tetraﬂuro-N,N,N-trimethylanilinium)
porphyrinato]. The remaining chlorite followed the more customary pathway of
disproportionation to chlorate and chloride. Production of O2 was proposed to begin
with oxygen atom transfer from chlorite to the Fe(III)porphyrin, forming Compound I.
The same step was invoked as in the initiating step for chlorate generation. However,
circa 1/5 of the time, the Compound I intermediate reacts with ClO instead of another
Fe(III)porphyrin, generatingO2 and Cl. Notably,enclosure of the ClO leaving group
and Fe(IV)¼O(porphyrin+•) species, as well as site-isolation of the reactive metal,
would both in principle improve the O2 yield from the otherwise catalytically compe-
tent Fe(III)porphyrin. Isolation of the reactive intermediates is an obvious role served
by the Cld protein environment.
In

reactions
described above, some manganese(III)porphyrins catalyze yet a further transfor-
mation of chlorite: its one electron oxidation to the chlorine dioxide (ClO2) radical
(Figure 13) [137, 138]. This reaction is preferentially catalyzed by the water-
soluble Mn(III) analogs of [Fe(III)(TF4TMAP)]5+ and by tetrakis-5,10,15,20-
(N,N-dimethylimidazolium) porphyrinatomanganese(III), [Mn(TDMImP)]5+. In
each case, the reaction was proposed to begin with oxygen atom transfer to the
Mn(III), generating the Mn(V)¼O product of heterolytic Cl–O bond cleavage in the
[Mn(TDMImP)]5+ system and a mixture of the heterolytic and homolytic
(Mn(IV)¼O) products in the presence of [Mn(TF4TMAP)]5+. The ClO leaving
group was able to re-enter the catalytic cycle as an oxygen-atom donor to Mn(III)
porphyrin. The ClO• (product of homolytic Cl–O cleavage) was proposed to react in
an uncatalyzed fashion with additional molecules of ClO
2 . The high-valent metal-
oxo species produced in either case served as one-electron oxidants toward chlorite
[109], generating neutral chlorine dioxide gas (eqn. 11).
Figure 12 Reactions of [Fe(III)TF4TMAP]5+, yielding O2, Cl, ClO
3 as ultimate end products.
The O2-generating mechanism on the left resembles the heterolytic/nucleophilic pathway pro-
posed for Clds in Figure 11. The Compound I-like intermediate can react with another molecule of
the aquated, Fe(III) catalyst, yielding two equivalents of Compound II (ferryl). This intermediate
reacts with further equivalents of chlorite to produce chlorate and the Fe(II) catalyst. Adapted
from [135].

This reaction is interesting in itself from a technological point of view, because
ClO2 is a reagent used in water puriﬁcation that must be produced near its point of
use because it cannot be easily compressed and stored. It also provides a potential
mechanistic contrast with Clds and the porphyrin complexes which generate
Compound I but appear to use it to transfer an oxygen atom to hypochlorite
(a two-electron process) rather than for the one-electron oxidation of chlorite.
Presumably, recombination between the Compound I and hypochlorite generated
in the conﬁned space above the Cld heme kinetically out-competes the reaction
between Compound I and another molecule of chlorite. This is a hypothesis that
awaits further experimental investigation.
5.2
Reactions of Chlorite with Horseradish Peroxidase:
Implications for Chlorite Dismutases
The use of chlorite as both an oxidant (oxygen-atom donor) and one-electron
reductant by the Mn(III)porphyrins mirrors the results of a careful, systematic
study of the reactions of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and chlorite [120].
The complexity of this reaction had been previously noted [139, 140]. In strong
contrast to Clds, Fe(III) HRP reacted with both chlorite and hypochlorite as oxygen-
atom donors (generating Compound I), followed by two molecules of chlorite
serving as one-electron donors to return the intermediate to the Fe(III) state (i.e.,
a complete peroxidase-like catalytic cycle, eqs 12–14). The chlorine dioxide prod-
ucts were also capable of donating an oxygen atom to the Fe(III) HRP, yielding
Compound I and chlorine oxide (Figure 14). The ultimate fate of the highly-reactive
ClO• radical was not clear.
Figure 13 Reactions of Mn(III)porphyrins with chlorite to produce ClO2. Left: Oxygen-atom
transfer from chlorite yields a Mn(V)¼O species that is then capable of two, sequential
one-electron oxidations of a pair of chlorite anions in a peroxidase-like catalytic cycle
(products ¼ 2ClO2, green; manganese ligand¼ TDMImP). Right: A slightly more complicated
proposed mechanism begins with electron transfer followed by atom transfer to the Mn(III)porphyrin
(L ¼ TF4TMAP), forming an Mn(IV)¼O species and ClO•. The latter reacts with chlorite to form
ClO2 and ClO. Hypochlorite reacts with Mn(III)porphyrin to form a Mn(V)-dioxo species analo-
gous to that in the left-hand panel, which oxidizes two molecules of chlorite to yield two ClO2.

Production of Dioxygen in the Dark: Dismutases of Oxyanions
79

In spite of having a relatively well-enclosed active site that could in principle
contain and steer ClO/ClO• leaving groups, neither appeared to recombine with
the HRP-ferryl to make O2. The reasons for this are unknown; however, the pH
dependence of the HRP reactions with chlorite may lend clues. Compound I
formation from Fe(III) HRP and ClO– or ClO
2 , but not ClO2, was highly dependent
on pH. In keeping with HRP’s known preference for neutral ligands, including
peroxide [141], the neutral/protonated species (HClO, HClO2) reacted preferen-
tially with the Fe(III) iron. The distal histidine in HRP and all the well-studied
plant peroxidases is critical for H2O2 deprotonation to form the Fe(III)-OOH
(Compound 0) complex. It may similarly be involved in deprotonating chlorous
acid (HClO2, pKa ¼ 1.72) [20, 123]. By contrast, Clds lack a distal histidine and
strongly prefer to bind cyanide and peracids in their anionic forms, with the distal
arginine helping to secure the bound anion [78, 89]. The subsequent reactions of
HRP-Compounds I and II with chlorite were also highly pH-dependent. The plotted
dependencies of log k versus pH were once again linear with a slope of 1,
indicating that Compounds I and II preferentially react with the HClO2 acid rather
than ClO
2 , in spite of the relative scarcity of the acid form (pKa 1.72) in biochem-
ically obtainable pH ranges. Again in contrast, it has been proposed that Compound
I in Clds reacts with hypochlorite in its anionic form, in part because ClO is a
better nucleophile than the HClO acid (pKa 7.5), and in part because the steady state
reaction is faster at low pH, where the distal arginine is expected to point toward the
heme plane and to stabilize the ClO leaving group [78, 98]. The Clds’ ability to
stabilize the hypochlorite leaving group in its anionic form may be critical for
Figure 14 Reactions of horseradish peroxidase with chlorite. In the ﬁrst step of the reaction (1),
charge-neutral chlorous acid transfers an oxygen atom to Fe(III) HRP to form Compound I and
hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid. Compound I then catalyzes two sequential one-electron oxida-
tions of chlorous acid molecules (steps 2 and 3), producing two molecules of chlorine dioxide and
returning the heme to the Fe(III) state. The inside of the diagram shows how both HClO and ClO2
are able to re-enter the catalytic cycle as oxygen atom donors, producing Compound I and either
Cl–or ClO• as the leaving groups, respectively. Figure adapted from [120].

promoting O–O bond formation, and for distinguishing Clds from (O)Cl–O
bond-cleaving, Compound I-forming peroxidases that nonetheless do not make
O2, such as HRP.
Alternatively or in addition, peroxidases are conventionally understood to
react with their substrates on the periphery of the heme rather than at the apex of
the distal pocket [121, 142–144]. Direct reaction of the porphyrin cation radical
and substrate prevents cytochrome-P450-like oxygen-atom transfer from the
Compound I intermediate to the substrate, which occurs when the substrate is
able to approach the ferryl oxygen from an optimal angle. In Clds, reaction of
hypochlorite with Compound I requires access to the same ferryl oxygen atom,
while peroxidase-style one-electron reductions can just as well occur at the heme
edge. It is possible that, in HRP, the distal pocket is not sterically conﬁgured to
promote attack of the ClO/HClO leaving group on the ferryl oxygen. Hence, O2
production is not observed.
6
General Conclusions
As work with Clds illustrates, there is seemingly nothing that nature can’t do with a
protein and a heme. The unusual transformation of ClO
2 to O2 and Cl is greatly
facilitated by enclosing heme in the relatively hydrophobic environment of chlorite
dismutase, with a well-positioned arginine needed to recruit and steer the anionic
substrate and intermediates. The arginine is a key innovation in an active site
pocket that seems otherwise well-suited for little more than heme decomposition.
The etiology of chlorite decomposition by Clds, the history of this fascinating
protein family, and the biogeochemical consequences of natural perchlorate respi-
ration all remain to be discovered by ongoing and future work.

Abstract Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal oxidase of cell respiration
which reduces molecular oxygen (O2) to H2O coupled with the proton pump. For
elucidation of the mechanism of CcO, the three-dimensional location and chemical
reactivity of each atom composing the functional sites have been extensively studied by
various techniques, such as crystallography, vibrational and time-resolved electronic
spectroscopy, since the X-ray structures (2.8 Å resolution) of bovine and bacterial CcO
have been published in 1995.
X-ray structures of bovine CcO in different oxidation and ligand binding states
showed that the O2 reduction site, which is composed of Fe (heme a3) and Cu (CuB),
drives a non-sequential four-electron transfer for reduction of O2 to water without
releasing any reactive oxygen species. These data provide the crucial structural basis
to solve a long-standing problem, the mechanism of the O2 reduction.
Time-resolved resonance Raman and charge translocation analyses revealed the
mechanism for coupling between O2 reduction and the proton pump: O2 is received by
the O2 reduction site where both metals are in the reduced state (R-intermediate),
giving the O2-bound form (A-intermediate). This is spontaneously converted to the
P-intermediate, with the bound O2 fully reduced to 2 O2. Hereafter the
P-intermediate receives four electron equivalents from the second Fe site (heme a),
one at a time, to form the three intermediates, F, O, and E to regenerate the
R-intermediate. Each electron transfer step from heme a to the O2 reduction site is
coupled with the proton pump.
X-ray structural and mutational analyses of bovine CcO show three possible
proton transfer pathways which can transfer pump protons (H) and chemical (water-
forming) protons (K and D). The structure of the H-pathway of bovine CcO
indicates that the driving force of the proton pump is the electrostatic repulsion
between the protons on the H-pathway and positive charges of heme a, created upon
oxidation to donate electrons to the O2 reduction site. On the other hand, mutational
and time-resolved electrometric ﬁndings for the bacterial CcO strongly suggest that
the D-pathway transfers both pump and chemical protons. However, the structure
for the proton-gating system in the D-pathway has not been experimentally iden-
tiﬁed. The structural and functional diversities in CcO from various species suggest
a basic proton pumping mechanism in which heme a pumps protons while heme a3
reduces O2 as proposed in 1978.

Introduction
Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal oxidase of aerobic cell respiration which
reduces molecular dioxygen (O2) to H2O coupled to the process of proton pumping.
Elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme at the atomic level is one of the
most important subjects in Biological Science. The mechanism for O2 reduction
without releasing any reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also a long standing problem
to be solved, in addition to the mechanism of coupling between the proton pump and
O2 reduction, and the mechanism of proton active transport [1, 2].
For the elucidation of the functional mechanism of a protein at the atomic
level, the most basic information can be deduced from its high resolution X-ray
structure. In the case of the CcO structure, a resolution at the hydrogen atom level
will be necessary, since the CcO reaction is critically controlled by proton
transfer. Usually, advances in our understanding of the reaction mechanism of a
protein go along with the resolution of its X-ray structure [2]. X-ray structural
analyses determine the three dimensional location of atoms composing the
functional site of the protein. However, crystallography does not provide direct
information on the chemical reactivity of the atoms in the protein. Thus, other
physical techniques are needed, such as vibrational spectroscopy. Resonance
Raman technique has given fundamental information for the mechanism of O2
reduction to which two hemes in CcO critically contribute. Unfortunately,
resonance Raman spectroscopy cannot be applied to examine proton transfer
during the course of the catalytic cycle, since proton transfer is not directly driven
by the Raman active chromophore. Thus, time-resolved infrared (IR) analysis is
indispensable for the elucidation of the reaction mechanism. However, because of
the strong IR absorption and of unavailability of a site-directed isotope labeling
system producing sufﬁcient amount of the sample, IR analysis has not been
successfully applied for the CcO system except in a few cases. Nevertheless,
our understanding of the reaction mechanism of CcO has improved remarkably
[2] since the early reports on the X-ray structures of bovine and bacterial CcO in
1995 [3, 4]. Here, the recent structural understanding of CcO will be reviewed
followed by a discussion on the O2 reduction, the proton pump, and their coupling
mechanisms based on the structural ﬁndings reported thus far.

The Structures of Bovine Heart Cytochrome c Oxidase
Recently X-ray structures of various bacterial CcO have been reported [5–10].
However, the structures of bovine CcO have been the most extensively studied [2]
and therefore they are summarized here.

2.1
Puriﬁcation and Crystallization of Bovine Heart
Cytochrome c Oxidase
For X-ray structural analyses of any protein and the structural determination of
cofactors and other constituents, such as lipids and hemes, puriﬁcation and crystal-
lization of the protein from the cell often represent the most difﬁcult steps. Bovine
heart CcO was solubilized with sodium cholate, a natural detergent, as early as 1941
[11], although the puriﬁed sample did not show any enzyme activity. However,
20 years later, cholate in the puriﬁed sample was replaced by non-ionic detergents
to yield the enzyme activity [12]. The active sample was crystallized in 1961
[13]. Yet, another 34 years were required to establish conditions for obtaining
crystals allowing the determination of the three-dimensional structure at 2.8 Å
resolution [3]. Almost in parallel, a bacterial CcO was crystallized by an ingenious
technique using a monoclonal antibody for promotion of the speciﬁc contacts
between the CcO molecules in the crystal lattice. As a consequence, X-ray struc-
tures of both bovine and bacterial CcOs at 2.8 Å resolution were reported in the
same week in 1995 [4].
The resolution of 2.8 Å is of course not at the hydrogen atom level. Therefore,
extensive efforts for improving the resolution of the X-ray structure have been
undertaken for bovine CcO. Bovine CcO contains 13 different subunits while
bacterial CcOs have much less subunits, with a molecular mass of about 1/2 of
the bovine enzyme [1, 3, 4]. Notably, bovine CcO shows one of the highest
resolutions of X-ray structures of CcO reported thus far [2]. Simpler subunit
composition might contribute to the stabilization of the isolated protein. However,
a simple subunit composition does not necessarily assure the stability of the whole
complex. In fact, the 10 nuclear coded subunits, which are not included in bacterial
CcOs, surrounding the 3 core subunits which are homologous to the bacterial
enzyme, are likely to stabilize the conformation of the core subunits to provide
the high resolution X-ray structure.

X-Ray Structure of the Protein Moiety
The three dimensional arrangement of the 13 different subunits of bovine heart CcO
is given in Figure 1. The biggest three core subunits I, II, and III are surrounded by
10 nuclear coded subunits [2]. The existence of 13 subunits in bovine heart CcO has
been documented by careful SDS-PAGE analyses and later approved by the X-ray
structure [14]. However, it should be noted that these two ﬁndings cannot exclude
the possibility that these subunits, the physiological functions of which are
unknown, are copuriﬁed and cocrystallized contaminant proteins. In fact, the
physiological role of the 10 nuclear coded subunits is still unknown.

2.3
Structure and Stoichiometry of the Metal Sites
Bovine heart CcO has four redox-active metal sites (Figure 2). The iron sites are
occupied by heme A which is characterized by a formyl group at position 8 and a
hydroxyfarnesylethyl group at position 2 (in the Fischer numbering of heme
peripheral groups). Since heme A is quite unstable compared to heme B and has
a signiﬁcantly more complex structure, its molecular structure was determined as
late as 1975, except for the absolute conﬁguration of the asymmetric carbon of the
hydroxyfarnesylethyl group [15]. This was determined to be an S-conformation in
2005 by X-ray structural analyses [16]. The two hemes A interact with the protein
moiety (subunit I) in different ways to provide completely different functions. One
heme A is in a low-spin state, with two axially coordinated histidine imidazole
rings, and is designated heme a (or Fea) (Figure 2). The second heme A is located
fairly close to the CuB site. It is in a ﬁve-coordinated high-spin state when reduced
and ligand-free, and is designated heme a3 (Fea3). The two heme planes are
perpendicular to the membrane surface and fairly close to each other (Figure 2).
The CuB site near Fea3 has a trigonal planar geometry in the reduced state, with
three histidines coordinated. Together with Fea3 it forms the O2 reduction site,
where Fea3 is the site for O2 binding. The second copper site, CuA, consists of two
copper ions bridged by two cysteine residues and is located in a cupredoxin
conﬁguration. This site reversibly accepts only one electron equivalent, the reduced
and oxidized states of CuA are designated as CuA
1+ and CuA
2+, respectively, in this
article. The cupredoxin conﬁguration had been shown by EPR analysis before the
determination of X-rays structures of bovine and bacterial CcOs [17]. The physi-
ological requirement of the dinuclear center against a mononuclear center has not
been elucidated. CuA is the initial electron acceptor from cytochrome c.
The X-ray structure of bovine heart CcO (Figure 3) indicates that CuA has three
electron transfer pathways to heme a3: (i) the His204-Arg438-D ring propionate of
heme a-Fea-heme a3 (the electron transfer between the two hemes is likely to be
very fast because of the proximity of the two hemes), (ii) the His204-Arg438-C ring
propionate of heme a3, and (iii) the Glu198-Mg2+-His368-D ring propionate of
heme a3 (numbering of amino acid sequences of bovine heart CcO is used unless
otherwise noted). However, the redox-inactive Mg2+ site is unlikely to convey
electrons, it rather blocks the electron transfer. No structural arguments against
pathway (ii) have been found in the X-ray structure. However, no experimental
results support the direct electron transfer from CuA to heme a3 by-passing heme a.
Thus, pathways (ii) and (iii) are inactive in CcO under physiological conditions.
Bovine CcO has two other redox-inactive metal sites, Zn2+ and Na+, in addition
to Mg2+. It has been suggested that the Na+ site contributes to facilitate proton
transfer through a peptide bond in the hydrogen bond network of the H-pathway as
described below. The physiological role of Zn2+ is still unknown.

Lipid Structures and Contents
Bovine CcO has lipids as intrinsic constituents which are likely to provide highly
non-polar microenvironments in the interior of the protein. Thus, the structural
determination is essential for the elucidation of its reaction mechanism. For lipid
analysis of a membrane protein, discrimination of the intrinsic lipids from the weakly
or accidentally bound lipids must be taken into account. Partial denaturation of the
membrane protein would weaken the binding afﬁnity of the intrinsic lipids. Thus, for
lipid analysis, a signiﬁcant amount of protein samples free of denatured molecules is
absolutely necessary. One of the best methods for removing denatured molecules is
crystallization. Using bovine CcO samples puriﬁed by repeated crystallizations, the
structure determination of the phospholipids was achieved (Figure 4) [18]. The
content and the three-dimensional structure of these phospholipids were determined
by ﬁtting these structures into the electron density of bovine heart CcO.
Subunit III, the second largest subunit, hosts the O2 transfer pathway to the O2
reduction site (Figure 5). Three phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE2),
phosphatidylglycerol (PG1 and PG2), form part of the wall of the O2 transfer
pathway (Figures 5a, 5b). These three phospholipids are tightly bound to the protein
moiety so that the electron density maps of the unsaturated bonds of the two PGs
identify the cis- against trans-conﬁgurations [18].

Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) treatment, which gives the dicyclohexyl-N-
acyl-urea (DCU) derivative of Glu90 in subunit III, inﬂuences the conformation of
PG1 and PG2 to close the O2 pathway (Figure 5c). The results suggest that
phospholipids control the O2 supply to the O2 reduction site. X-ray structures of
these fatty acid tails indicate that their ﬂexibility is maximally utilized for a different
space-ﬁlling function [18].

Mechanism of Dioxygen Reduction
As described above, CcO has four redox-active metal centers, each of which
reversibly receives one electron equivalent. Thus, the fully reduced form of CcO,
in which all four metal sites are in the reduced (one-electron received) state, will
reduce O2 completely to 2 H2O and represents a suitable system to investigate the
mechanism of the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. However, O2 reduction
by CcO is too fast to follow by conventional rapid mixing techniques which usually
have a dead time in the range of 1 ms. Furthermore, CO does not block the O2
access completely within the time range of the manual operation. Consequently, a
ﬂash-photolysis procedure has to be used, where CO-bound CcO is mixed with
O2-saturated buffer and CO is ﬂashed off in the presence of O2. CO is able to block
the O2 access of CcO within a few ms in the dark.
It is well-known that the one-electron reduction of O2 to the superoxide anion,
O
2 ,
is
energetically
unfavorable
while
simultaneous
(or
non-sequential)
two-electron reduction is energetically favorable [19]. This intrinsic property of
O2 contributes signiﬁcantly to the stability of the oxygenated form of hemoglobin
and myoglobin. However, IR data indicate that the O–O stretch band position is
close to that of superoxide [20]. In other words, the oxygenated form of CcO can be
best described by a resonance structure Fea3
2+-O2 $ Fea3
3+-O
2 ; for the sake of
simplicity, the structure of the oxygenated form is written as Fea3
3+-O
2 . It should
be noted that the Fea3
3+-O
2 species cannot be compared to Fe3+-Cl which will
release Cl upon lowering the Cl concentration. On the other hand, oxygenated
hemoglobin, or myoglobin, will release O2 to form deoxygenated Fe(II)-globin.
As described above, the O2 reduction site of CcO is composed of a dinuclear site
(Fea3
2+, CuB
1+). Thus, the second electron to the bound O2 at Fea3
2+ is readily
available from CuB
1+, and the ﬁrst intermediate of the O2 reduction process is most
likely not the O2-bound form (Fea3
2+-O2 $ Fea3
3+-O
2 ) as described above.
3.1
Resonance Raman Analysis
Since the historical report of the ﬂow-ﬂash analyses by Gibson and Greenwood
[21], extensive work has been performed on the process of O2 reduction by fully
reduced CcO, following the UV-vis spectral changes. However, because of the
limitation of absorption spectroscopy, the identiﬁcation of the structure of the initial
intermediate of the process remained unsuccessful until the resonance Raman
technique was introduced by three research groups [22–24].
In contrast to absorption spectroscopy, the resonance Raman technique provides
various structural ﬁndings, such as the chemical structure of the heme-bound
ligand, which cannot be obtained from absorption spectral analyses. Another
advantage is that the isotope shift effect is applicable for the assignment and
identiﬁcation of bands. A successful application of this technique to examine the
process of the O2 reduction by the fully reduced bovine heart CcO is given in Figure 6

[25]. Each spectrum represents a difference spectrum (16O2 against 18O2) at each delay
time after ﬂash photolysis of the CO-bound fully reduced CcO in the presence of O2.
The initial intermediate detectable at the delay time of 0.1 ms shows the Raman band at
571 cm1 for 16O2 versus 544 cm1 for 18O2. As no other band is detected, this band
must result from the initial intermediate in the reaction between O2 and the fully
reduced CcO. The band position is essentially identical to those observed for oxygen-
ated hemoglobins and myoglobins. In other words, quite unexpectedly, the band
position strongly suggests that the initial intermediate is Fea3
3+-O
2 .
In order to conﬁrm this assignment, the isotope shifts of unevenly labeled O2
(18O16O) have been examined. If this band is due to the O2 bound at Fea3
2+, the
18O16O difference spectra versus spectra with 16O2- and 18O2-labeled dioxygen
would show two bands located between the bands due to 16O2 and 18O2. However, if
this band is due to Fe4+¼O2 (ferryloxide form) which is formed in the later stage
of the O2 reduction process, the two bands would appear at the same positions as the
bands due to 16O2 and 18O2. The former results have been observed [26]. However,
the results do not discriminate Fe3+-O
2 versus Fe3+-O2 
2
(oxygenated versus
peroxide-bound). However, it is well-known that the peroxide-bound form does
not show a Fe–O stretch band near 570 cm1, while the oxygenated form does not
show a O–O stretch band near 800 cm1 [27]. In fact, the initial intermediate does

derivative from the

not show the O–O band. Thus, it has been well accepted that the structure of the
initial intermediate (A-intermediate) is Fe3+-O
2 .
The second intermediate shows the 804/764 cm1 band which signiﬁcantly over-
laps with the 785/750 cm1 band (Figure 6B). The former band disappears at a delay
time of 2.7 ms (Figure 6D), when the 785/750 cm1 band still exists. Thus, the
804/764 cm1 and 785/750 cm1 bands are due to the second and third intermediates
following the A-intermediate. The fourth intermediate showing the 450/425 cm1
band appears at a delay time of 2.7 ms (Figure 6D). It should be noted that the process
at 3 C is signiﬁcantly slower than the results at room temperature reported thus far.
The resonance Raman spectral changes recorded during the course of the
reaction between the mixed valence CcO and O2 have been examined for the
assignment of these bands. When CO is introduced to CcO in the two-electron
reduced state, CO stabilizes both Fea3 and CuB in the reduced state [Fea3
2+-CO and
CuB
1+], which is designated as the mixed valence CO-bound form. The reaction
between O2 and the mixed valence CcO [Fea3
2+, CuB
1+, Fea
3+, CuA
2+] can be
examined applying the ﬂash photolysis technique to this form. In this case, the
bound O2 would not be completely reduced. The resonance Raman results have
shown that the 571/544 cm1 band appears as the initial intermediate, followed by
the 804/764 cm1 band without showing the 785/750 and 450/425 cm1 bands
detectable during the process of the fully reduced CcO with O2 [28, 29]. These
results indicate that the 804/764 cm1 band is directly produced from the
A-intermediate and that the intermediate giving the 804/764 cm1 band is in one
oxidation state higher than that of the 785/750 cm1 band.
Taking into account the intrinsic chemical property of O2, as described above [19],
the bound O2 in the A-intermediate [Fea3
3+-O2
, CuB
1+] is very likely to extract
one electron from CuB
1+ to form a peroxide-bound (or -bridged) form [Fea3
3+-
O2
2-CuB
2+]. Therefore this intermediate is designated as P-intermediate. However,
unexpectedly, the isotope shift effects detectable using unevenly labeled (18O16O)
clearly have shown that Fea3 is a mono-oxygen-bound species (Fe4+¼O2) [26]. In
other words, the bound O2 in the A-intermediate has been completely reduced to the
O2 level. Four electron equivalents are required for complete reduction of O2. Two
electron equivalents are available from Fea3
2+ and one electron equivalent from CuB
1+.
The origin of the fourth electron equivalent is still under debate although the OH group
of Tyr244 which is covalently connected to one of the histidine ligands of CuB has been
proposed [30, 31]. Similarly, the experiments with unevenly labeled (18O16O) indicate
that both the 785/750 and 450/425 cm1 bands favor a mono-oxygen-bound species.
The observed band at 450/425 cm1 strongly suggests that it is due to Fea3
3+-OH.
Thus, the 785/750 cm1 band is assigned to the ferryloxide form, Fe4+¼O. These
intermediates are designated as O and F, respectively (Figure 7). In this ﬁgure, one of the
oxidation equivalents in the P-intermediate is located on Fea3 for the sake of simplicity.
The O2 reduction process has been extensively examined by following the UV-vis
spectral changes [32–36]. Because of the much wider bandwidths of the absorption
spectra of these intermediates, compared with those of the Raman bands, straightfor-
ward interpretations for the absorption spectral changes remain difﬁcult. However,
these absorption spectral results essentially conﬁrm the resonance Raman results.

3.2
X-Ray Structural Data
The resonance Raman results from above indicate that the P-intermediate, in which
the bound oxygen has been fully reduced to the O2 level, appears as the direct
decay product of the A-intermediate. Thus, under normal turnover conditions, it is
impossible to detect the elementary steps of the process O2 ! 2 O2. In other
words, the decay of the intermediate species between O2 and 2 O2 is much faster
than their formations. Since the O2 reduction is catalyzed by a protein, it is
impossible to exchange the rate-limiting step in the physiological temperature
with the other elementary step by a temperature change since the temperature
range in which normal turnover proceeds is quite narrow. Thus, effects of O2
analogues or respiratory inhibitors of the O2 reduction site have been investigated
extensively by X-ray crystallography.
NO, which is the best O2 analogue, binds to Fea3
2+ in a bent end-on fashion
(Figure 8a). As schematically shown, the distance between CuB and the O atom of
NO is 2.5 Å, suggesting that the ligand-CuB interaction is very weak [37]. From the
trigonal planar coordination geometry of the CuB site it can be deduced that Cu is
both a poor ligand acceptor as well as a poor electron donor, which also will
contribute to weaken the interaction between the ligand and CuB. Tyr244 is the
Figure 7 Schematic representation of the catalytic cycle of CcO. For the sake of simplicity, the
low potential sites (Fea and CuA) and the possible electron donation site for the O2 reduction
process, Tyr244, are not included. The fourth oxidation equivalent created upon P formation is
putatively located on Fea3 in the P-intermediate.

possible fourth electron donor to produce the P-intermediate [30, 31]. However, as
clearly shown in Figure 8b, the interaction between the bound NO and Tyr244-OH
is effectively blocked by the imidazole ring of His240. Thus, a signiﬁcant confor-
mational change is required for the OH group to interact with the bound ligand to
allow electron transfer. The X-ray data presented provide a strong structural basis
for the stability of the O2-bound form of CcO (A-intermediate, Figure 7).
The X-ray structure of the cyanide-bound fully reduced form (Figure 8c) shows
fairly large rearrangements of the CuB site [37]. One of the three histidines, His290,
coordinated to CuB in the fully reduced ligand-free state, dissociates from the CuB
site and CN forms a new trigonal planar CuB center perpendicular to the heme
plane (Figure 8d). The other end of the bound cyanide interacts with Tyr244 with a
short hydrogen bond network including a ﬁxed water (water510). A signiﬁcant
translational movement of the heme plane is necessary to form this hydrogen bond
network. Water510 is likely to be transferred from a water storage site nearby,
detectable in the X-ray structure of CcO (Supporting Information in [37]). This
X-ray structure strongly suggests that the O2 reduction site can form three possible
electron transfer pathways to the bound O
2 , that is, from CuB, Fea3, and Tyr244-OH
via water510. The results provide a strong structural basis for the non-sequential
three-electron donation to the bound O
2 .

These results indicate a possible O2 reduction mechanism as described in Figure 9
[37]. When the O2 reduction site is in the fully reduced state, O2 is received by CuB
(Figure 9b). The transient ligand binding to CuB has been shown by IR analyses [38,
39]. As discussed below, time-resolved IR data suggest that this transient binding is a
prerequisite for effective collection of pump protons. At an appropriate timing sensed
by CuB, O2 is transferred to Fea3
2+ to form Fea3
3+-O
2 which induces the signiﬁcant
rearrangement of the CuB site, as CN does, to give the three possible electron
transfer pathways to the bound O2 (Figure 9d). The non-sequential three electron
transfer steps to bound O
2 will reduce O
2 completely to provide the P-intermediate
(Figure 9e) without releasing reactive oxygen species.
3.3
Biomimetic Studies
Studies with synthetic model complexes have provided various crucial insights into
the mechanism of O2 reduction by CcO once the X-ray structures of CcOs had been
published.
A model of the O2 reduction site has been synthesized (Figure 10) [27, 40], which
includes all functional groups interacting with both copper and iron. Hereby, Cu is
trigonally planar coordinated whereas Fe is ﬁve-coordinated to a porphyrin, with an
axial imidazole ligand. The iron and copper moieties are tethered together by three
phenyl groups at the three methene bridges of the porphyrin. The fully reduced model
complex binds O2 to form a superoxide bound state [Fe3+-O
2 , Cu1+], in agreement
with the resonance Raman band at 570/544 cm1 band for the (16O2/18O2) isotopes.
The oxygenated compound is stable at room temperature under vacuum. However,
when Cu is removed, low temperature is required to stabilize the O
2 -bound state. The
intrinsic chemical property of O2, i.e., thermodynamically unfavorable one-electron
reduction and favorable two-electron reduction, does not predict these properties.
The model complex, with O2 bound, oxidizes phenols producing two equivalents
of the phenoxy radical species and the reduced complex [Fe3+OH, Cu2+-
OH]. This stoichiometry indicates that O2 has been reduced to two OH
(or H2O), without the release of ROS. Further examination of the reaction under

various experimental conditions suggest the formation of a peroxo intermediate
[Fe3+-OOH, Cu2+] and a ferryloxo intermediate [Fe4+¼O2, Cu2+-OH] [41]. As
described above, the fourth electron donor for formation of the P-intermediate in
the normal turnover of CcO is still debated. However, the biomimetic studies
strongly suggest Tyr244 being the fourth electron donor.
Model compounds in which a phenol group is covalently attached to one of the
three imidazoles coordinated to Cu have been synthesized [42]. The phenol group
mimics Tyr244 of CcO directing toward the O2 reduction site. The fully reduced
model compound reduces O2 to provide oxidized products containing a ferryloxo
and a phenoxy radical. Esteriﬁcation of the phenol OH group leads to a signiﬁcant
increase in ROS production. Note that the unmodiﬁed model complex produces
small but still signiﬁcantly higher amounts of ROS compared with CcO. It has been
proposed that the speciﬁcity of O2 binding to the reduced catalytic site, with both Fe
and Cu reduced (Fe2+, Cu+), is critical for O2 reduction and linked to this the release
of potential ROS. In CcO, the catalytic site accepts O2 only when both Fe and Cu
are reduced (Fe2+, Cu+), whereas in the case of the model compounds O2 also binds
to the partially reduced (Fe2+, Cu2+) state [43].
The peroxide-bridged intermediate (Fea3
3+-O2 
2 -CuB
2+) has not been detected
under normal CcO turnover conditions. However, it is likely for the peroxide-
bridged species to appear as an intermediate in the reaction step from the A- to
the P-intermediate during which O2 receives four electrons. Thus, extensive model
studies have been reported for peroxide compounds in order to examine the roles of
each component of the O2 reduction site. Cu complexes mimicking the CuB site,
with three and four nitrogenous ligands (tri- and tetradentate, respectively,
Figure 11a) have been synthesized [44]. These Cu complexes form high-spin
peroxide-bridged [Fe3+-O2 
2 -Cu2+] species with Fe(II)-heme (Figure 11b) [44].
Both high-spin peroxide-bridged [Fe3+-O2 
2 -Cu2+] species, independent of whether
Cu is coordinated to a tridentate or a tetradentate ligand, are more or less inactive
towards phenols. In the case of the tridentate [Fe3+-O2 
2 -Cu2+] species, Fe is
coordinated by the strong ligand 1,5-dicyclohexyl-imidazole (DCHIm) to produce
a low-spin complex (Figure 11b, structure (2b)). In contrast, the tetradentate [Fe3+-
O2 
2 -Cu2+] species, with DCHIm liganded to Fe, is unstable (Figure 11b).

The results indicate that Cu complexes with tridentate ligands stabilize the
low-spin peroxide species. In contrast to the high-spin species, the low-spin peroxide
complex shows strong reactivity to phenols to receive one electron equivalent for
reducing the bound peroxide completely to the 2 O2 level giving Fe4+¼O2 (2c),
Cu2+-OH and a phenol radical (Figure 12) [44]. Thus, in order to reduce the bound
peroxide in the compounds given in Figure 12, the tridentate Cu complex stabilizes

the low-spin state which has reactivity towards the phenolic OH group. However, Cu
coordinated by a tetradentate ligand does not form the low-spin peroxide species.
These experimental ﬁndings document the importance of the tridentate structure of
CuB in CcO for stabilizing the low-spin peroxide species. The above accomplish-
ments clearly show a typical successful example of the biomimetic model approach
to metalloprotein chemistry giving unique and thoughtful insights.
A tetradentate tethered model complex (Figure 13) [45] has O2 reduction activity
in solution, using decamethylferrocene and triﬂuoroacetic acid as electron and
proton donors, respectively. Remarkably, this system shows effective electron
transfer, with turnover numbers up to 1000, without producing ROS. At room
temperature, the fully reduced (Fe2+, Cu1+) state seems to be the steady state species
while at 60 C, a hydroperoxo state [Fe3+OOH, Cu2+] is the steady-state species.
Thus, the rate-limiting step moves from O2 binding to cleavage of hydroperoxo by
the temperature decrease. A careful comparison of the structures of these model
compounds with the X-ray structure of CcO at high resolution would provide
various insights in the O2 reduction mechanism.

Proton Pump Mechanism
As schematically shown in Figure 7, the R-intermediate receives O2 to form the
A-intermediate which is spontaneously converted to the P-intermediate. The bound
O2 is completely reduced to O2 and OH in the P-intermediate. The fourth
electron equivalent and one proton equivalent are most likely from the Tyr244
OH group. The P-intermediate receives four electron equivalents, one at a time to
generate the R-intermediate. Each electron transfer is coupled with the transfer of
one chemical proton equivalent and one pump proton equivalent. Thus, in each
catalytic cycle, one O2 molecule is reduced to two water molecules by four
electrons and four chemical protons, coupled with translocation of four protons
across the membrane. The energy conversion (or coupling) efﬁciency is quantiﬁed

by the ratio of pump proton/electron of unity in the case of bovine CcO. This
coupling between O2 reduction and the proton pump has been established by the
Wikstro¨m group [46–48], as given below.
4.1
Coupling Between Dioxygen Reduction
and Proton Pump
Here, the experimental results for the establishment of the coupling mechanism are
introduced as one of the most ingenious accomplishments in Bioenergetics.
In the catalytic cycle (Figure 7), the pathway from R to O is designated as the
oxidative phase, while the second part is termed the reductive phase. The movement of
electrical charge equivalents across the membrane during both phases has been deter-
mined by a system for time-resolved charge translocation during a single catalytic cycle
of CcO starting from O2 binding to the fully reduced CcO. Two phases are observed, a
fast one (amplitude 44 %) and a slow one (amplitude 55 %) (Figure 14) [46]. The
amplitude of the fast phase is independent of the Fe(II)-cytochrome c concentration
while the maximum amplitude of the slow phase is obtained by an excess of Fe(II)-
cytochrome c. Therefore, the fast and slow phases are assignable to the oxidative and

reductive phases in the catalytic cycle. In a single catalytic cycle, 8 charges are
transferred in total, i.e., 44 % and 55 % amplitudes correspond to 3.5 and 4.5 charges,
respectively. Each of the charge translocation includes those due to electron transfer
from CuA to heme a, chemical proton transfer coupled with each electron transfer from
heme a to heme a3 and the proton pump. The electron transfer pathway heme a! heme
a3 is parallel to the membrane surface, meaning no charge translocation is provided by
this process. The charge translocation due to chemical proton transfer can be estimated
by the charge translocation due to the electron transfer heme a! CuA upon photolysis
of CO bound mixed valence CcO in the absence of O2, since the amount of the electron
transfer heme a! CuA can be quantiﬁed by UV-vis spectroscopy. Charge translocation
induced by a single electron transfer CuA ! heme a corresponds to 32 % of that induced
by a single charge translocation across the membrane. This value is reasonable for the
location of CuA and heme a [47]. Thus, the charge translocation for a process can be
quantiﬁed from its electrometric response. The two hemes are located in parallel to the
membrane surface so that transfer of a single chemical proton from the negative side of
the membrane to heme a3 induces charge translocation corresponding to 68 % (100 % –
32 %) of that induced by a single charge translocation across the membrane. In the
oxidative phase, two chemical protons are transferred from the negative side (inside the
proteoliposome) to the O2 reduction site. The chemical protons provide 2 (100 % –
32 %) charge translocations induced by a single charge translocations across the
membrane. Since the oxidative phase started from fully reduced CcO, only one electron
is transferred from CuA to heme a during the oxidative phase. Consequently, 2 (100 % –
32 %) +32 % charge translocations result from charge movement of the non-proton
pump. This charge location (168 %) corresponds to the movement of 1.68 charges
across the membrane. Thus, charge movement due to the proton pump can be estimated
to be 1.82 charges (3.5 – 1.68). For the reductive phase, one electron equivalent must be
transferred from CuA to heme a for regeneration of fully reduced CcO after a
two-electron transfer for reducing the O2 reduction site. Thus, (2+0.32) charge move-
ments are due to non-proton pumping events. This value determines the charge
translocation due to the proton pump as (4.5 – 2.32¼ 2.18). These results indicate
that both in the oxidative and in the reductive phases two equivalents of protons will
be pumped across the membrane [46].
For a more quantitative evaluation of the efﬁciency of the proton pump, proton
ejection from proteoliposomes of bovine CcO, determined with a sensitive pH meter,
was titrated with electron equivalents added in the presence of O2 (Figure 15) [48]. The
results show that four electron equivalents reduced CcO ejects two proton equivalents,
while three- and two-electron-reduced CcO eject one and zero proton equivalents,
respectively. The results ﬁt quite well to the calculated curve assuming that each of the
P ! F and F ! O transitions is coupled to pumping of a single proton equivalent. The
results from above obtained for the reductive phase are not sufﬁciently accurate to
discriminate between the calculated curves, assuming that each of the O ! E and
E ! R transitions is coupled with a single proton pump and assuming that O! E
transition pumps two protons, while E ! R transition is not coupled with the proton
pump. However, a single electron injection experiment for the O-intermediate shows
one equivalent of proton pumped in the O ! E transition. Thus, another equivalent of
proton in the reductive phase must be pumped in the E ! R transition [48].

4.2
Single Electron Injection Analyses of the Intermediates
of the Catalytic Cycle
Various methods for preparing or stabilizing the intermediate species (Figure 7)
have been developed. Each of the individual electron transfer steps is coupled to
the proton pump, and the role of these intermediates has been carefully evaluated by
the single electron injection technique coupled to time-resolved electrometric and
UV-vis spectroscopic analyses [49].
4.2.1
F ! O Transition
The single injection experiments of CcO were made for the ﬁrst time for the F ! O
transition of bovine CcO in proteoliposomes [50]. Treatment of resting oxidized
bovine CcO with excess H2O2 provided a stable preparation with resonance Raman
and UV-vis spectral characteristics of the F-intermediate. The F-intermediate, upon
single photoreduction, showed three charge translocation phases with the time
constants τ of 45 μs, 1.2 ms, and 4.5 ms. The initial phase proceeds with the
same rate as that reported for the electron transfer CuA ! heme a [50, 51].
The initial rapid phase does not include reduction of heme a3. On the other hand,
the X-ray structure shows that hemes a and a3 are located very close to each other,
suggesting extremely rapid electron transfer. This is conﬁrmed by femtosecond
Figure 15 Proton ejection during oxidation and reduction of bovine heart CcO. Proton ejection
was measured by a sensitive pH meter after addition of stoichiometric amounts of O2 to CcO
reduced anaerobically in various extents. The upper curve shows a calculated result assuming that
one proton equivalent is ejected at each of the four transitions, P ! F, F ! O, O ! E, and E ! R,
while the lower curve is the results of the calculation assuming one proton ejection at each of the
transitions P ! F and F ! O, two proton ejections at O ! E, and no ejection at E ! R. Reproduced

UV-vis spectroscopy for the electron transfer heme a3 ! heme a upon photolysis of
the mixed valence CO complex [52]. Obviously, under single photoreduction
conditions, the redox potential of heme a3 is signiﬁcantly lower than that of heme
a, and protonation of heme a3 in the next step is a prerequisite for the electron
transfer heme a ! heme a3. The initial fast step is KCN-insensitive.
The following two charge translocation phases, with τ 1.2 and 4.5 ms, are
KCN-sensitive. These phases must be due to proton translocations, since the electron
transfer pathway heme a ! heme a3 runs parallel to the membrane plane.
The amplitudes of the three phases are 20 %, 37 %, and 43 % of the total
charge movement. The F ! O transition is coupled, in total, with two electrical charge
movements across the membrane as described above. Thus, the three phases are due to
the movements of 0.40, 0.74 and 0.86 charges across the membrane [49, 53].
In order to examine which membrane potential generation is due to the transfer of
pump protons, the properties of the Asn139Asp (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering)
CcO variant, which shows no proton pumping without impairment of O2 reduction
activity, were examined electrometrically and spectrophotometrically. The charge
movement consists of two phases, the KCN-insensitive (15 μs) one and the
KCN-sensitive (0.6 ms) [54]. The 0.6 ms phase shows a strong H2O/D2O kinetic
isotope effect (4-fold decrease in the rate in D2O). In the wild-type enzyme the 4.5 ms
phase reveals a strong H2O/D2O kinetic isotope effect, in contrast to the 1.2 ms phase
which does not show any signiﬁcant effect. The KCN-sensitive phase of the Asn139Asp
variant must be due to chemical proton movement since it does not show any proton
pump function. Thus, the H2O/D2O kinetic isotope effect of the Asn139Asp variant
suggests that the slow (4.5 ms) phase is due to the chemical proton transfer.
4.2.2
The Other Transitions
All the other single electron reduction steps, P! F, O! E, and E! R, have been
extensively examined by the single photoreduction technique coupled to electrometric
and UV-vis measurements, providing essentially the same results as those for the F! O
transition [49]. The results show three phases including a rapid KCN-insensitive phase
followed by two slower (intermediate and slow) KCN-sensitive phases. The amplitude
ratio is 2:4:4. The three phases are can be assigned to the vectorial electron transfer
CuA ! heme a, the pump proton transfer, and chemical proton transfer. Considering the
nature of the chemical events happening in the O2 reduction site between the four
transitions, the similarity in the electrometric responses due to each single electron
reduction strongly suggests a common proton pump system apart from the chemical
proton transfer pathways such as the K- and D-pathways.
4.3
D-Pathway Mechanism
It has been believed that in the protein interior, protons are transferred through a
hydrogen bond network or carried by mobile water molecules, in the hydronium ion
H3O+ state. Thus, a potential proton transfer pathway can be identiﬁed in high
112
Yoshikawa, Shimada, and Shinzawa-Itoh

resolution X-ray structures. Bovine heart CcO has three possible proton transfer
pathways, K, D, and H (Figure 2) [2]. Figure 16 shows atomic models of the K- and
D-pathways of bovine CcO in the fully oxidized state. These structures are well
conserved in the CcO A family. An acidic amino acid, Glu242, is located near the
upper end of the D-pathway, which does not have obvious structural features for
proton transfer connections to the O2 reduction Fea3/CuB site. The side chain of
Glu242 has sufﬁcient space for conformational changes. However, it is possible
to induce a hydrogen bond network connecting to the O2 reduction site by intro-
ducing two ﬁxed water molecules as represented in the inset of Figure 16. This
conformational change is assured by the ﬂexibility of Gly239 which is well
conserved. The two O2 or OH anions in the network are likely to be provided
by O2 reduction at the Fea3/CuB site. Thus, the hydrogen bond network is likely to
be set up when the P-intermediate is produced.
A D-pathway variant, Glu242Gln, abolishes not only the proton pump function
but also the chemical proton transfer in the oxidative phase. The K-pathway variant,
Lys319Met, does not inhibit the chemical proton transfer in the oxidative phase,
although it abolishes the turnover activity, reduction of O2 to water (by blocking
the chemical proton transfer in the reductive phase). When the mutation results

were reported [55, 56], it was widely accepted that protons were pumped only in the
oxidative phase. Therefore, it was considered that these mutation results conﬁrmed
the proposition that both pumping and chemical protons were transferred by
D-pathway. Since then, most of the experimental results have been interpreted
based on the above proposition.
4.3.1
Water-Gated Mechanism
If the D-pathway transfers both chemical and pumped protons, this pathway must have
a branching point which sorts chemical protons from pump protons. Furthermore, it
must have a proton-loading site for gating the proton transfer or facilitating unidirec-
tional proton active transport. The glutamate Glu242 has been thought to be the
candidate for such a branching point, while one of the propionate groups of heme a3
is a candidate for the proton loadingsite. However, theX-ray structure suggests that this
propionate forms a tight salt bridge with Arg438. The bridge seems too stable to have
the gating function for the proton pump. Nevertheless, many proton pump mechanisms
through the D-pathway have been proposed. The water-gated mechanism is one of
Figure 17 Schematic representation of the water-gated mechanism. In (a) heme a is reduced
while the O2 reduction site (heme a3/CuB) is oxidized. The electric ﬁeld between the two redox
active sites determines the orientation of the water array to facilitate the proton transfer from
Glu286 (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering) to the propionate (prp) of heme a3 which is a
putative proton-loading site. The proton transfer to the proton-loading site in (b) is coupled to the
electron transfer to heme a3/CuB (c). The electric ﬁeld change due to the electron transfer switches
the orientation of the water array coupled with proton uptake from the negative side (N-side) (d).
Then, protons on Glu286 are transferred to heme a3/CuB (e) to stimulate proton release to the
positive side space (P-side) (f). Reproduced by permission from [57]; copyright 2003 Elsevier.

the most sophisticated ones which has been extensively examined theoretically [57].
A schematic representation of this mechanism is shown in Figure 17.
A water cluster is assumed in the hydrophobic cavity between the O2 reduction
site and Glu242 (Glu286 in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering). The starting
point of the proton pump cycle is depicted in Figure 17a, with heme a in the reduced
state and Glu286 protonated. The water molecules are located regularly for proton
transfer from Glu286 to prp, the propionate group of heme a3. The proton transfer to
prp inﬂuences the alignment of the water-cluster for preventing the reverse proton
transfer (Figure 17b). The redox potential of the O2 reduction site (abbreviated as
a3/CuB in the Figure 17) is increased by the protonation of prp to induce electron
transfer to the Fea3, CuB site (Figure 17c). Then, the reduction of a3/CuB induces
protonation of Glu286 (Figure 17c). Protonation of Glu286 stimulates proton
release from prp to the hydrophilic domain of the positive side (P-side) of heme
a3 (Figure 17d) and also inhibits the back leak of the pumped protons. The chemical
proton on Glu286 is transferred to a3/CuB (Figure 17e). This positive charge on a3/
CuB releases the pumped proton in the hydrophilic domain to the P-side
(Figure 17f).
The ﬂexibility of the Glu242 side chain is expected to contribute to blocking the
spontaneous back leak of protons from prp. The possibility has been conﬁrmed by
computer simulation [58]. In addition to the function of Glu242, the water-gated
mechanism as given above has been extensively examined by various simulation
techniques. Recently, opposite conclusions have been reported [59, 60].
The possible proton-loading site, the heme propionate, forms a tight salt bridge
to Arg439. At least, X-ray structures strongly suggest that this salt bridge is too
strong to accept protons reversibly on a physiologically relevant time scale as
stated above. However, extensive mutagenesis analyses for the site for bacterial
aa3-type and E. coli bo3-type CcOs have shown that mutations of Arg439 (Lys,
Gln, Asn, Leu) and Arg438 (Lys, Gln) do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the proton
pump activity, while the Arg438Gln/Arg439Gln double mutation and Arg439Pro
and Arg438 (Asn, Leu) mutations impair the proton pump activity [61–63]. The
results do not allow a straight forward interpretation. The modiﬁcations
Arg ! Gln, Asn, Leu, with serious impacts on the structure, do not lead to any
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the enzyme activity, clearly a result speaking against the
proposal for the proton-loading function of the heme propionate. On the other
hand, the other mutations as described above, strongly support the proposal.
Furthermore, a computer simulation analysis [64] suggests that the opening of
the salt bridge, depending on the oxidation state of the metal sites, is possible in a
physiologically relevant time scale.
It has been proposed that CcO must have a system for discharging the membrane
potential to avoid deteriorative effects induced by an unusually high membrane
potential [65–67]. As schematically shown, a space in which the water array
(or cluster) is putatively located in the water-gated mechanism (Figure 17) connects
the heme propionate and the O2 reduction site. Thus, it is possible that the space
4
Respiratory Conservation of Energy with Dioxygen
115

connecting the propionate with the O2 reduction site is the discharge system. Thus,
one of the interpretations of the above mutation results is that the proton pump
inhibition is caused by an increase in the reverse proton transfer through the
discharge system by structural modiﬁcation of the salt bridge.
4.3.2
Experimental Results Suggesting that Both Chemical
and Pumped Protons Are Transferred
Through the D-Pathway
It is impossible to identify the location of the proton pump system only by
mutational analyses. For example, the Glu242Gln mutation abolishes the transfer
of both pumped and chemical protons. The O2 reduction is tightly coupled with
chemical proton uptakes through the D- and K-pathways. Thus, blocking chemical
proton transfer through the D-pathway by a Glu242 mutation impairs completely
the O2 reduction. Then, the proton pump cannot function because of lack of energy
supply. Clearly, this mutation does not provide useful information on the location of
the proton pump system. Nevertheless, the electrogenic analyses of various
D-pathway mutations, together with the X-ray structure of the D-pathway as
given below, have provided experimental results supporting that the D-pathway
transfers both chemical and pumped protons.
The structural changes in the O2 reduction site in the F ! O and P ! F transi-
tions are Fea3
4+¼O2 to Fea3
3+-OH and the Tyr244–O• radical to Tyr244-OH,
respectively. Each of these transitions requires transfer of one equivalent of
chemical proton. Thus, abolishment of these transitions (the oxidative phase)
by Glu242Gln mutation together with the location of Glu242 most likely
results from a blockage of chemical proton transfer through the D-pathway
[56]. It can be concluded that the D-pathway is used for transfer of the
chemical protons.
The A ! P transition process during reduction of O2 by fully reduced CcO
which is coupled to the oxidation of heme a, shows that the charge translocation
corresponds to the one that would be induced by translocation of a single proton
equivalent from Glu242 to the heme a3 propionate [68]. The charge transloca-
tion from Glu242 has been established by mutation analysis [68]. This proton
translocation is unlikely due to the proton donation to the O2 reduction site
which would induce the P ! F transition. Most likely, the D-pathway facilitates
proton transfer to a site other than the O2 reduction site in addition to the proton
transfer to the O2 reduction site [69]. Furthermore, if Glu242 transfers protons to
the propionate as discussed above, followed by the proton transfer to the O2
reduction site giving the P ! F transition, in a CcO with a mutation at the
entrance of the D-pathway, Asp124Asn (in Paracoccus denitriﬁcans number-
ing), the proton on Glu242 is used to protonate the heme propionate. However,
this mutant shows a P ! F transition, suggesting that the D-pathway has another
116
Yoshikawa, Shimada, and Shinzawa-Itoh

proton-loading site [70]. The site has been identiﬁed with an Asp124Asn/
Tyr35Phe double mutation which abolishes both the P ! F and the F ! O
transition. Deprotonation of Tyr35 has been proven by IR analyses [70]. These
results strongly suggest that the D-pathway transfers protons to two different
sites. One of the sites is likely to be for loading pump protons. However, the
gating function (or unidirectional proton transfer) of the proton loading site has
not been shown.
Furthermore, the propionate group, if this is the proton-gating site, must have
structures sorting pump protons from chemical protons as mentioned by Williams a
long time ago [71]. Although a sophisticated water-gated mechanism has been
proposed [57], the postulate of Williams has not been proven byconcrete experimental
evidence.
4.4
H-Pathway Mechanism
The redox-driven proton pump in CcO must be driven by redox-coupled confor-
mational changes. Fairly large redox-coupled conformational changes around
Asp51 near the positive side surface of bovine CcO were discovered at 2.3 Å
resolution in 1998 [72]. The X-ray structures show that Asp51 is connected to the
negative side surface of CcO by a hydrogen bond network and a water channel as
schematically shown in Figure 18a. These structures strongly suggest that the
system including the hydrogen bond network and the water channel represents
the proton pump system of CcO. Later, this system was designated as the
H-pathway. However, Asp51 is conserved only in the animal kingdom. Plant and
bacterial CcO enzymes do not have this residue [2]. On the other hand, the
D-pathway is conserved in animals, plants, and bacteria. Thus, the function of the
H-pathway as the proton pump system has not been completely accepted. Note that,
as described below, some bacterial CcOs do not have the D-pathway.
4.4.1
Structure and Function of the H-Pathway
The structure of the H-pathway is schematically shown in Figure 18a [73]. The
upper half of the pathway is a hydrogen bond network connecting Asp51 at the
positive side surface with Arg38. The Arg38 at the bottom end of the hydrogen
bond network is connected with the positive side surface by a water channel
(shadowed area) through which water molecules from the negative side space can
access the Arg38 site. The shadowed ovals and circles denote the spaces in which at
least one molecule of water can be stored. The space is designated as water cavity.
Arg38 at the bottom end of the hydrogen bond network is hydrogen-bonded to the
formyl group of heme a (Figure 18b). One of the ﬁxed water molecules in the
hydrogen bond network is also hydrogen-bonded to heme a via the propionate of
the D ring.

The redox-coupled conformational changes at Asp51 are given in Figure 19
[2]. Asp51 is buried inside the protein in the oxidized state (Figure 19b), the
carboxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to two OH groups of serine residues and two
peptide NH groups, suggesting that the carboxyl group is in a highly non-polar
environment. However, upon reduction of CcO, Asp51 becomes exposed to the
molecular surface (Figure 19b). In reduced CcO, Asp51 is hydrogen-bonded to
3 water molecules and one serine OH group. Thus, the microenvironment of the
Asp51 carboxyl group is essentially the same as in water. This structural change,
which indicates a large redox-coupled change in effective pKa, strongly suggests
that Asp51 is the proton-loading site of the proton pump system in CcO. The redox-
coupled protonation state change has been conﬁrmed by FTIR analyses (see
Supporting Information in [74]). A redox titration of the protonation state change
has shown that the oxidation state of one and only one of the low potential sites
(heme a and CuA) controls the protonation state of Asp51.
In the oxidized state, the Asp51 COOH group is hydrogen-bonded to the NH
group of the peptide bond between Tyr440 and Ser441 (Figures 18 and 19)
[73]. Proton transfer through a peptide bond has been well established a long

time ago [75]. However, because the enol tautomer of the peptide bond
(–C(OH)¼N–) is less stable than its keto tautomer (–CO–NH–), the proton transfer
is likely to be unidirectional. The function of this peptide bond as the proton transfer
pathway has been examined by theoretical analyses, conﬁrming that the unidirec-
tional proton transfer through the peptide bond is possible on a physiologically
relevant time scale. The results of the theoretical analyses also suggest a possible
contribution of the Na+ site for effective unidirectional proton transfer [76].
Conformations of the water channel and the heme a are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by the oxidation state of bovine CcO (Figure 20a) [74]. The conformational
changes are schematically shown in Figure 20b. In the reduced state, the water
channel has six water cavities. One of the cavities near the upper end of the water
channel is eliminated upon oxidation by formation of a bulge structure including
Ser382 (Figure 20a). Another redox-coupled conformational change is detectable in
the hydroxyfarnesylethyl group. The OH group is hydrogen-bonded to Ser382 in
the oxidized state. The hydrogen bond is broken upon reduction, which could
trigger the water cavity formation. In the oxidized state, the water channel has a
long narrow pathway through which effective water migration seems impossible in
the physiologically relevant time scale (Figure 20b). Thus, the conformations of the
water channel in the oxidized and reduced states are designated as closed and open
conformations, respectively. In the closed state, proton back leak from the hydrogen
bond network is effectively blocked. X-ray structures of various respiratory inhib-
itor derivatives and the O2 reduction intermediates show that P, F, and O interme-
diates as well as the strong ligand (CO and NO) bound derivatives of fully reduced

CcO show the closed conformation of the water channel. In other words, the water
channel is open only in the R-intermediate [37].
The proton pump is coupled to electron transfer heme a ! heme a3, one at a time
after formation of the P-intermediate, giving the F, O, E, and R intermediates
(Figure 7). Thus, all these proton pumping events occur when the water channel
is closed. These results indicate that proton back leaks from the hydrogen bond
network are blocked by both the upper and bottom ends of the H-pathway. The
peptide bond has also a critical role for preventing collapse of the proton motive
force by back leak from the positive side of the membrane.
4.4.2
The Structure for Proton Collection and Timely Closure
of the Water Channel
The X-ray structural results given in the preceding section suggest that four
equivalents of pumped protons must be collected when the O2 reduction site is in
the ligand-free fully reduced state [Fea3
2+, CuB
1+]. Also, the timely closure of the
water channel after collection of the four equivalents of pumped protons is a
prerequisite. The timely closure is most likely controlled by O2 binding to the O2
reduction site of the R-intermediate. In order to elucidate the mechanism of the
timely closure of the water channel, the conformational change of the channel upon
O2 binding to the O2 reduction site has been investigated by time-resolved IR
techniques. The used instrument is sufﬁciently sensitive for analyses of the IR
properties of a single peptide C¼O group in the amide-I region of proteins in H2O
[77]. As a model system for O2 binding to fully reduced CcO, CO-bound CcO has
been investigated by time-resolved IR studies. Upon ﬂash photolysis of CO-bound
CcO, the photolyzed CO is stoichiometrically transferred to CuB within 50 ns.
Then, the CO at CuB is released with the time constant of 2 μs from the protein. The
most prominent IR spectral change detectable in the 2 μs phase can be assigned to
the change in the bulge conformation including Ser382.
In the open state (the ligand-free fully reduced state) Ser382 is located very near
the biggest cavity shown in Figure 20 but not involved in the wall of the cavity
(Figure 21) [77]. Upon CO (or O2) binding to the O2 reduction site, the cavity is
eliminated by the movement of Ser382 towards the cavity. The wall of the water
cavity consists mostly of non-polar carbon atoms to provide a very high non-polar
environment (Figure 21). Thus, Ser382OH interacts with the protons carried by H2O
inside the cavity to sense the overall protonation level inside the cavity. The

protonation level is likely to be equilibrated with the protonation state of the
hydrogen bond network. As shown in Figure 21b, Ser382 is located in a helix turn
which is an adjacent turn containing the ﬁfth ligand of heme a3, His376. The structure
suggests a conformational relay system including Ser382, two helix turns, His376,
Fea3, the ligand to Fea3 and/or CuB and CuB. The relay system is expected to transfer
information to the metal sites on the protonation state of the cavity sensed
(or captured) by Ser382. Thus, the complete protonation of the hydrogen bond
network is sensed by the protonation level of the water cavity by Ser382 which
transfers the information to the metal site (Fea3
2+/CuB
1+). Upon receiving the

peptide N–H of Met383. The Ser382 OH group is not part of the cavity surface. (b) Structural

information from Ser382 via the relay system, O2 moves from CuB to Fea3 to trigger
the conformational change in Ser382 via the relay system to eliminate the water
cavity.
When CO is bound to CuB, the IR data suggest that CO bound at CuB after the
photolysis induces a migration of Ser382 to the location half-way between those of
the closed and open conformations [77]. In other words, when CO is at CuB, the
cavity still exists and Ser382 is closer to the cavity compared to the location of
Ser382 in the open conformation. Thus, the negatively polarized Ser382 OH group
is expected to contribute to proton collection from the negative side space of the
membrane. It has been well known that O2 is trapped ﬁrst at CuB before binding to
Fea3
2+. Therefore, in analogy to the CO binding results, O2 bound at CuB is
expected to induce the conformational change in Ser382 via the conformational
relay system to the intermediate conformer to promote effective proton collection.
At present, it is not clear whether the hydrogen bond network of the H-pathway has
sufﬁcient capacity for the storage of four equivalents of protons. A higher resolution
in the X-ray structure of CcO is required.
4.4.3
Mutational Analyses of the H-Pathway
The X-ray structural and vibrational spectroscopic data clearly show that the
H-pathway functions like the proton pump system in bovine CcO. However, it is
indispensable to examine the function of the H-pathway to elucidate its role in
proton pumping. For this purpose, various mutations of the H-pathway have been
introduced by using the stable expression system of the subunit I gene of bovine
heart CcO in HeLa cells (the H-pathway is included in subunit I). As mentioned
above, the H-pathway sequence of bovine CcO is not completely conserved in
bacterial CcO. Thus, mutations of bovine CcO are indispensable for examination of
the active H-pathway function.
Three bovine CcO variants, Asp51Asn, Ser441Pro and Val386/Met390Trp, have
been prepared to investigate the role of D51 and the peptide bond between Tyr440
and Ser441 in proton transfer, and the water transfer function of the water channel,
respectively [74, 78]. It is well-known, that proline has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
native protein conformation and the consequences of such a mutation are difﬁcult to
interpret. However, the dihedral angle of the peptide bond between Tyr440 and
Ser441 in the X-ray structure indicates that a conformational change induced by the
mutation is expected to be minimal. The exchange of Ser441 against Pro prevents
the formation of the protonated imidic acid intermediate (–C(OH)¼NH+–). A
molecular dynamics calculation [78] suggests that the double mutation of the
amino acid residues in the water channel will lead to a complete closure of the
channel. The phenotypes of these three mutations are identical, namely, no proton
pump without affecting electron transfer activity. Three results clearly conﬁrm the
proposal for the function of the H-pathway as the proton pump system, based on
X-ray and IR analyses.

Diversity in Proton Transfer Pathways
Recently CcOs from various origins have been puriﬁed and their crystal structures
have been solved. These results reveal signiﬁcant variances of the structures of the
proton transfer pathways [79, 80]. The CcOs discovered thus far have been classiﬁed
into 4 families, A1, A2, B, and C [79]. The A1 CcO family, which includes bovine
CcO, has active D- and K-pathways and Glu242 in the D-pathway. In the A2 family,
the position of the carboxyl group of Glu242 is occupied by an OH group of tyrosine
residue located on the adjacent helix turn. Reversible deprotonation of the tyrosine has
been conﬁrmed by IR analysis [80]. CcOs belonging to the B and C families do not
have an active D-pathway. The mutational analyses of the K-pathway of CcOs of the
B family indicate that the K-pathway transfers chemical protons in both oxidative and
reductive phases. Namely, the K-pathway is the only pathway for chemical proton
transfer. CcOs of the C family do not have the tyrosine corresponding to Tyr244 in
bovine CcO which is covalently linked to one of the three His ligands of CuB.
However, the tyrosine is replaced by a tyrosine from an adjacent helix. Thus,
Tyr244 is not conserved but the covalent link between His and Tyr is conserved [79].
This diversity is consistent with the difference in the two reactions driven by
CcO, that is, the proton pump and the O2 reduction. The former is a chemically
simple process which various amino acid side chains can conduct. Thus, the proton
transfer pathway system of CcOs shows signiﬁcant diversity, although the function
(proton transfer from the negative side to the O2 reduction site) is conserved.
However, O2 reduction without releasing ROS is much more complex by compar-
ison. No better system than the present Fe/Cu system has been found in the history
of evolution. Thus, the structure of the O2 reduction site is completely conserved in
all CcOs discovered thus far.
The physiologically important amino acid residues are conserved in different
species. Conservation of amino acid residues is a useful criterion to identify the
functional sites of a protein. In the case of CcO, only the O2 reduction site structure
including the Tyr-His covalent linkage are conserved, and it has been proposed that
O2 reduction coupled to proton pumping is conducted only by the Fe/Cu dinuclear
site including the His-Tyr covalent linkage, although no possible concrete mecha-
nism has been given for the proposal [81]. However, note that the lack of the active
D-pathway in CcOs of the B and C family does not prove that the D-pathway in
CcOs of the A family is inactive. Similarly, lack of Asp51 in bacterial CcO does not
automatically mean that the H-pathway is inactive in bovine CcO.
The proton pump activity of these pathways in bacterial CcO has been examined
by various point mutations. In the case of the bovine CcO water channel, which is
impaired by the double mutation [78], point mutation of the branched or bypassed
proton transfer pathway would not inﬂuence the overall proton pump activity. It has
been proposed that in the B and C family CcOs, both pump and chemical protons
are transferred through the K-pathway. However, as described above, the location
of the proton pump pathway cannot be identiﬁed just by mutational analysis. It
should not be ignored that the low spin heme center is completely conserved in all
CcOs identiﬁed thus far. The low spin heme center of bovine CcO drives the proton
124
Yoshikawa, Shimada, and Shinzawa-Itoh

pump as described above. Thus, the low-spin heme center can also drive the proton
pump in other CcOs as has been proposed a long time ago (Figure 22) [55]. That is,
heme a and a3 drive the proton pump and O2 reduction coupled to chemical proton
transfer, respectively [49, 55].
The recent resonance Raman results on the effect of H2O/D2O exchange in the
propionate groups of hemes a and a3 of bovine CcO strongly suggest that the
propionate groups of hemes a and a3 are well isolated from each other in terms of
proton exchange so that direct proton transfer between the two heme propionates
located side by side is completely blocked [82–84]. The results strongly suggest
that proton active transport through the H-pathway including heme a proceeds
without any interaction with the heme a3 site. In other words, this property is
expected to block the leaks of pumped protons to the O2 reduction site to be used
as chemical protons, which would dissipate the free energy for the proton pump.
Thus, the resonance Raman results indicate that the postulate brought forward by
Williams [71] is fulﬁlled in the proton pump driven by the H-pathway.

General Conclusions
The reaction mechanism of CcO is one of the biggest challenges to be tackled in
modern Biological Science [2]. In order to understand the mechanism of any
protein function on the atomic level, high resolution X-ray structures of the
functional sites of the protein are a strict prerequisite. In the case of cytochrome

numbers: (1) the initial electron transfer from cytochrome c; (2) proton uptake from the negative
phase; (3) translocation of pump protons from the bottom of the input well to the bottom of the
output well; (4) electron transfer from heme a to the O2 reduction site; (5) release of the pump
proton to the positive side; (6) uptake of the chemical proton from the negative side. Reproduced

c oxidase, the enzyme isolated from bovine heart has provided X-ray structures at
1.8 Å resolution, which provides electron density sufﬁciently accurate for the
identiﬁcation of the cis- (against trans-) conﬁguration of the unsaturated bond of
fatty acid tails of phospholipids tightly bound to the protein moiety [18].
The X-ray structures of various respiratory inhibitor (competitive inhibitors of
O2)
derivatives
suggest
that
the
bound
O2
induces
signiﬁcantly
large
rearrangements in coordination structures of the O2 reduction site forming three
possible electron transfer pathways to the bound O
2 resulting in a non-sequential
three-electron reduction to O
2 for complete reduction to the O2 level without
releasing any ROS [37]. Elegant studies using biomimetic complexes have allowed
various unique insights on the mechanism of the O2 reduction which cannot
be obtained by the analyses of the natural protein system. For example, the
tridentate (trigonal planar) structure of CuB is a prerequisite for stabilizing the
Fe3+-O
2 state [27]. The copper structure is also critical for the facile electron
transfer to the peroxide-bridged intermediates by stabilizing the low spin heme-
peroxide-copper
state
[44].
Thus,
the
peroxide-bridged
intermediates
are
undetectable in the normal enzyme catalytic cycle. Furthermore, various model
compounds suggest the requirement of Tyr244 as electron donor to the bound O2
[27, 44].
In the X-ray structure of bovine CcO the H-pathway has been detected which
suggests a proton active transport driven by electrostatic repulsion between protons
on the hydrogen bond network of the H-pathway and the positive charge of heme
a created upon oxidation for electron transfer to heme a3 for O2 reduction
[74]. Effective proton collection and proton gating systems have been identiﬁed
in the X-ray structure. These X-ray structural ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by
mutational analyses of bovine CcO [74, 78].
Diversity in the structure of the transfer systems for chemical and pump protons
suggests a common mechanism of CcO, that is, the low-spin (a and b) and high-spin
(a3, b3, and o3) hemes drive proton pumping and O2 reduction, respectively,
consistent with the original proposal made a long time ago [49, 55].

Abstract In order to address how diverse metalloprotein active sites, in particular
those containing iron and copper, guide O2 binding and activation processes
to perform diverse functions, studies of synthetic models of the active sites have
been performed. These studies have led to deep, fundamental chemical insights into
how O2 coordinates to mono- and multinuclear Fe and Cu centers and is reduced to
superoxo, peroxo, hydroperoxo, and, after O-O bond scission, oxo species relevant
to proposed intermediates in catalysis. Recent advances in understanding the
various factors that inﬂuence the course of O2 activation by Fe and Cu complexes
are surveyed, with an emphasis on evaluating the structure, bonding, and reactivity
of intermediates involved. The discussion is guided by an overarching mechanistic
paradigm, with differences in detail due to the involvement of disparate metal ions,
nuclearities, geometries, and supporting ligands providing a rich tapestry of
reaction pathways by which O2 is activated at Fe and Cu sites.

Introduction
1.1
Overview
The use of dioxygen as a source of energy and as a reagent for functionalization of
organic molecules is critical to life on Earth. Since the photosynthetic cyanobacteria
began producing O2 ~ 109 years ago, life forms have evolved by means to capture O2
and use it for diverse functions. Dioxygen serves as a sink for electrons in respiration
(to yield H2O) and the source of O-atoms in critical biosyntheses of essential
organic compounds. The thermodynamics for such uses are quite favorable, but
the paramagnetic triplet state of O2 imposes a kinetic barrier that enables it to
coexist with combustible diamagnetic substrates. Nature overcomes this kinetic
barrier by using reactive centers that can undergo single-electron transfer reactions
or that contain unpaired electrons. Such centers include organic radicals, photo-
chemically produced triplet excited states, and transition metal centers. Of these,
132
Yee and Tolman

transition metal centers (Cu and Fe, in particular) in proteins play especially impor-
tant roles in the binding and reduction of O2 during metabolic processes (Table 1)
[1]. Such metalloprotein active sites exquisitely control the dioxygen-utilizing reac-
tion pathways in order to promote the desired biological function and prevent
deleterious formation of damaging byproducts (reactive oxygen species, ROS, such
as H2O2 or HO•).

What is the basis of this control? How do structurally diverse metalloprotein
active sites guide the O2 binding and activation processes so as to perform diverse
functions with the requisite rates and selectivities? These and related questions
have driven extensive research over many decades that has led to deep insights into
metalloprotein structure/function relationships. Among the myriad research
approaches followed, studies of synthetic models of the active sites have been
notably useful for understanding the fundamental chemistry involved in O2 binding
and activation [2, 3]. In addition, such studies have informed and stimulated the
development of new reagents and catalysts for oxidation reactions.
In this chapter, we summarize the current understanding of dioxygen activation
by transition metal centers gleaned from studies of synthetic complexes relevant to
metalloprotein active sites, with particular emphasis on recent advances. We focus
on the chemistry of Fe and Cu because of their prevalence in biology. For context,
we ﬁrst outline a general mechanistic paradigm that underlies research in the ﬁeld.
The subsequent discussion is organized by the type of metalloprotein active site,
and in each case begins with a brief summary of older work into which readers can
delve by consulting various cited reviews. In more expanded discussion, we then
focus on recent work that has provided notable new understanding of dioxygen
activation mechanisms. While aiming to be as comprehensive as feasible, we
cannot hope to fully cover the breadth of the ﬁeld. Thus, we have chosen to focus
on speciﬁc mechanistic issues that we view subjectively as being of particular
signiﬁcance. We apologize to those whose work we neglect, and hope that the
cited reviews will make up for our deﬁciencies and point readers to a more
complete understanding of the ﬁeld.
1.2
Paradigm for Dioxygen Activation by Metalloprotein
Active Sites
The diverse and sometimes quite complicated mechanisms by which speciﬁc
metalloprotein active sites bind and activate dioxygen can best be evaluated and
understood by placing them within the context of an overarching, general mecha-
nistic paradigm (Figure 1). According to this picture, a site with available electrons,
either in the form of one or more metal ions (M) in a reduced oxidation state and/or
with ligands (not shown) that are “non-innocent” and thus capable of providing
reducing equivalents, binds to the O2 molecule and reduces it to superoxide (O2
 •)
to yield adduct A. This metal-superoxide adduct may be reduced further to the
peroxide level, with concomitant delivery of a proton or involvement of an addi-
tional metal ion (species B). Scission of the O-O bond may then occur to yield
metal-oxo or -oxyl species (C), again with possible involvement of additional
protons or metal ions. At each stage of the process, electrons ﬂow to the coordinated
O2 moiety, either from the ligand/metal unit or from an external source.
We emphasize that this picture is highly schematic and generalized; a variety of
structures, bonding patterns, and oxidation levels are possible for A–C.
134
Yee and Tolman

In considering any generalized mechanistic picture, it is of particular interest to
evaluate to what extent it is followed as a function of the speciﬁc attributes of the
systems under study. Researchers thus have focused on how the nature of the metal
ion(s) and its coordinating ligands, the geometric and electronic structures of the
sites, the role of additional cofactors, and the protein environment inﬂuence
the structures, stabilities, interconversions, and reactivity of A–C. Studies of
synthetic complexes designed to replicate aspects of the metalloprotein active
sites provide important insights into these inﬂuences, including protein environ-
ment effects as reﬂected by secondary-sphere hydrogen bonding involving suitable
designed ligands, for example.
As discussed in more detail below, studies of the structures, spectroscopic
properties, reactivity, and reaction mechanisms traversed by synthetic compounds
reveal to what extent the general dioxygen activation paradigm is followed,
whether diversions from this pathway occur, and, perhaps most importantly, the
fundamental chemical basis for the observed properties and reactivity. In the end,
one sees a rich diversity in the dioxygen activation mechanisms, with differences in
the properties of the intermediates involved and the energy landscapes traversed.
Understanding the fascinating chemistry underlying these differences continues to
be a goal of research, with current progress reﬂected by the discoveries described in
the following sections.

Dioxygen Activation by Iron Porphyrins
Heme containing enzymes are ubiquitous in nature, many of which bind and
activate O2 or which utilize O2 intermediates in order to perform a variety of
functions (Table 1, entries 1,2,7,16). These functions include oxygen transport,
the oxidation of organic substrates via hydroxylation or O-atom transfer reactions,
and the reduction of O2 to water. It is no wonder that such enzymes have gained so
much attention over the last three to four decades. Modeling of heme enzyme active

modeling has led to key insights regarding the heme enzymatic systems as well
as the potential of these synthetic systems to perform as catalysts in synthetic
chemistry. In the following sections, recent advances in synthetic oxy-heme
systems will be the focus, being prefaced with a brief discussion about O2 activation
by heme enzymes. For a more in depth discussion of previous work in oxy-heme
chemistry, both biological and synthetic, the reader can look to numerous reviews
on this topic [4–11].
2.1
Dioxygen Activation at Heme-Iron Centers:
Lessons from Cytochrome P450cam
Much of what is known about O2 activation by heme centers has been elucidated
through the study of cytochrome P450cam, which carries out the stereo- and
regio-selective hydroxylation of camphor to yield 5-exo-hydroxy-camphor [12].
Extensive structural and spectroscopic data [12–16] on this enzyme has provided a
clear picture of the mechanism of O2 activation, which serves as the paradigm for
O2 activation by heme enzymes and models. As shown in Figure 2, the resting state
of the enzyme is a six-coordinate, low-spin Fe(III)-OH2 adduct (1). Binding of
the substrate (RH) triggers the loss of the axial water molecule and results in a
change in spin state to give a ﬁve-coordinate high-spin Fe(III) complex (2).
Reduction by one electron of the Fe(III) center generates the Fe(II) adduct 3,
which is now poised to activate O2. Binding of O2 generates an Fe(III)-superoxo
intermediate (4), which can be further reduced by one electron to give the Fe(II)-
superoxo complex 5. Intramolecular electron transfer from the Fe(II) center to the
O
2 ligand followed by protonation results in the formation of Fe(III)-hydroperoxo
intermediate 6 (also known as Cpd 0), and heterolysis of the O-O bond leads to the
formation of a highly reactive Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical (7). Species 7 (known
as Cpd I) is the proposed active species that performs the initial C-H bond activation
of camphor, which leads to the alcohol product bound to the Fe(III) center 8;
displacement by a water molecule regenerates the resting state [12].
The nature of the axial ligand as well as the distal residues are crucial in
facilitating the O-O bond breaking process. In the case of cytochrome P450cam,
axial ligation of an anionic thiolate ligand provides a strong electronic “push”
that inductively strengthens the Fe-O bond of 6 [17]. At the same time, it is
proposed that a well ordered water molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to
136
Yee and Tolman

conserved Asp251 and Thr252 residues, serves to protonate the distal oxygen
atom of the hydroperoxide ligand, pulling away the resulting water molecule
[12]. The strengthening of the Fe-O bond coupled with the simultaneous forma-
tion/loss of water has been termed the “push-pull” mechanism [18] and results in
the cleavage of the O-O bond and the formation of Cpd I (7).
Similar structural features are found in catalase and peroxidase enzymes, which
form Cpd I by cleavage of the O-O bond in H2O2 (Figure 3). In both of these
enzymes deprotonation of the proximal O-atom of the H2O2 ligand is performed by
a distal histidine residue upon coordination. This proton is transferred to the distal
O-atom, and the resulting water molecule is pulled away by either an asparagine or
an arginine residue in the case of catalase (Figure 3a) or the peroxidases (Figure 3b),
respectively [19]. In contrast, the active sites of heme-O2 carriers lack the push-pull

machinery for O-O bond cleavage. For example, in the case of oxy-myoglobin
(oxyMb) (Figure 3c) a non-hydrogen bonded neutral histidine residue serves as a
much weaker axial ligand, and the distal pocket lacks the polar residues necessary
to pull the O-O bond apart [19].
Over the past four decades signiﬁcant progress has been made in characterizing
the various intermediates shown in Figure 2 for a number of enzymatic systems, yet
many questions still remain. In addition to being of fundamental interest, a better
understanding of how nature is able to harness the oxidizing power of O2 and H2O2
will enable the development of greener, more efﬁcient catalysts for industrial
purposes. With these goals in mind, chemists have turned to synthetic models.
2.2
Iron-Porphyrin Complexes as Heme Models
Generally, iron-porphyrin models have been developed with the dual purpose
of (1) providing a better understanding of the spectroscopic signatures of the
enzymatic systems and consequently the electronic nature of these intermediates,
and (2) reproducing the reactivity of these systems, both as a means of understand-
ing the structure-function relationship for these systems and for the purpose of
catalyst development. The following sections focus ﬁrst on the structural and
spectroscopic features of these systems, beginning with models that bind O2 and
proceeding in order of the O2 reduction process described above in Figure 2.
Discussion of the reactivity of these models with speciﬁc regard to O-O bond
cleavage and C-H bond activation will follow.

2.2.1
Fe(III)-Superoxo Intermediates
The ﬁrst step in the activation of O2 by iron-porphyrin complexes involves binding
to the Fe(II) ion. Initial attempts to prepare such 1:1 Fe-O2 adducts were met with
difﬁculty due to the propensity of these early models to undergo auto-oxidation via
the intermediacy of (μ-η1:η1-peroxo)diiron intermediates [10]. Success in model
studies was achieved by inhibiting dimerization, often through the use of sterically
hindered porphyrin rings, and using aprotic organic solvents as well as low tem-
peratures in order to mitigate auto-oxidation pathways. Generally, oxygenation of a
high-spin (S ¼ 2) Fe(II) precursor yields a low-spin (S ¼ 0) six coordinate
oxy-heme complex [10, 20].
Building upon the early, now classic work in this area [10], recent studies have
provided new insights. For example, in work aimed at providing benchmark
information for studies of models of cytochrome c oxidase (Section 2.3.1), revers-
ible O2 binding to the Fe(II) precursor of 9 was observed at 80 C (Figure 4)
[21]. Manometry conﬁrmed the formation of a 1:1 O2/Fe adduct in tetrahydrofuran;
however, in non-coordinating solvents the reversible formation of a μ-peroxo dimer
was observed, as supported by a 1:2 O2/Fe stoichiometry [21]. More recently,
compounds 10–12 have also been synthesized in which the axial solvent molecule
has been replaced by a pendant imidazole or pyridyl ligand [22, 23]. Compounds 9,
10, and 12 have been assigned as low-spin Fe(III)-superoxide species, primarily on
the basis of their 1H NMR and UV-vis spectra, as well as resonance Raman
(rR) data in the case of 9 [22]. The assignment of 11 was inferred based on its
conversion to an Fe(III)-peroxo intermediate upon one electron reduction [23].

Crystallographic
characterization
of
synthetic
oxyheme
compounds
has
remained elusive, and to date, compounds 13a–c (termed the “picket-fence
porphyrin”) are the only crystallographically characterized examples. The structure
of 13b was ﬁrst solved in 1978, but was plagued by severe disorder of the O2 ligand
as well as high thermal motion [24, 25]. Very recently, data for this structure,
along with those of 13a,c, was recollected at low temperature (100–300 K) [26].
Important features of these structures include a bent η1-coordination of the O2
ligand to the iron center and disorder of the O2 ligand over 4 positions, the
occupancies of which are temperature-dependent [24–26]. At low temperatures
(80 K), a 6.2 tilt in the Fe-O bond relative to the normal of the porphyrin plane
is resolved for 13c, which results in an O-O bond length of approximately 1.28 Å.
This distance is consistent with values of ν(O-O) and with bond lengths proposed by
DFT calculations [27–29]. Taken together, the crystallographic data are in satisfy-
ing agreement with that of oxyMb [30].
Despite the availability of crystal structures and evidence from rR experiments,
the nature of the Fe-O2 bonding in oxy-heme species is still not fully understood.
Three main descriptions have persisted since the 1960’s and these are summarized
in Figure 5 [31–33]. In models b and c, anti-ferromagnetic coupling is proposed to
account for the observed diamagnetism of these species. Recent theoretical studies
support model b for oxyMb [34]. The results of these studies indicate a
π-interaction for the Fe-O2 moiety resulting from single electron transfer from the
iron center to the O2 ligand. Even more recently, iron L-edge X-ray absorption
studies on 13b have also revealed a signiﬁcant π-interaction which the authors
interpret as involving donation from the π* orbital of an O
2 ligand into the empty dπ
orbital of the iron center [35]. However, comparison of the data to a set of Fe(II) and
Fe(III) standards show the oxidation state of the iron center to be most consistent
with an S ¼ 0 Fe(II) conﬁguration. Mo¨ssbauer spectra, which are characterized by

large quadrupole splittings and small isomer shifts, also support an Fe(II) center
with a strong π-interaction to the O2 ligand [36]. Taken collectively, these results
point towards an oxidation state of the iron center that is intermediate with respect
to low-spin Fe(II) and Fe(III), which results from signiﬁcant charge-transfer
facilitated by a strong π-interaction for the Fe-O2 moiety.
2.2.2
Fe(III)-Peroxo Intermediates
The second step in O2 activation by iron-porphyrins is the one-electron reduction of
the initial Fe-O2 adduct formed upon O2 binding, which yields species best formu-
lated as Fe(III)-O2 
2
[12, 37, 38]. Alternatively, treatment of the Fe(II) precursor
with O
2 can also generate Fe(III)-O2 
2
adducts [39]. Some representative examples
are shown in Figure 6.
Early studies performed on compounds 14a and 15 led researchers to formulate
these species as side-on bound (η2-peroxo)Fe(III) species on the basis of spectro-
scopic evidence from EPR, Mo¨ssbauer, and magnetic measurements, which con-
ﬁrmed the high-spin Fe(III) state of the iron center [39, 40]. Further characterization
of the O-O and Fe-O bonding by IR, rR, and EXAFS spectroscopy supported a
symmetrically bound peroxo ligand [39, 41]. These data have served as benchmarks

for the characterization of other model compounds (14b–d, 16) (Figure 6), which
all show similar spectroscopic features [42–44]. In a more recent report, compound
16 was found to be in equilibrium with an Fe(II)-O
2 form. Preparation of this
species was achieved by the treatment of the Fe(II) precursor with two equivalents
of O
2 [42]. Kinetic and equilibrium studies showed the reaction between the
Fe(II) precursor and O
2 to be fast, with the equilibrium strongly in favor of the
bound species. New experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that 16 actually
exists in equilibrium with its (η1-superoxo)Fe(II)(DMSO) isomer rather than a
resonance form of 16 [45].
The high-spin state and side-on binding of these previous examples are in
contrast to what has been observed in heme enzymes [38]. Recently, the ﬁrst
example of a low-spin (η1-peroxo)Fe(III) intermediate (17) (Figure 6) was prepared
which utilized an imidazole-tailed hang-man porphyrin motif to sterically force the
end-on binding of the O2 
2
ligand [38]. The synthesis of this species was achieved
by oxygenation of the Fe(II) precursor followed by one electron reduction with
cobaltocene at 70 C. Spectroscopic comparison of the end-on and side-on
imidazole-tailed Fe(III)-O2 
2
species revealed some signiﬁcant differences for the
end-on adduct. These differences include a blue shifted Soret band, as well as a
low-spin Fe(III) EPR spectrum and higher-energy Fe-O stretching frequencies for
the end-on complex. Interestingly, both species were suitable precursors for the
formation of the corresponding Fe(III)-OOH species, suggesting the possibility that
protonation of the η2 adduct involves the initial transition to the η1 conformation
[23, 38].
2.2.3
Fe(III)-Hydroperoxo (Alkylperoxo) Intermediates
In the P450 and peroxidase enzymes, as well as in catalase, an Fe(III)-
hydroperoxo intermediate (Cpd 0, 6 in Figure 2) is the precursor to Cpd I (7 in
Figure 2), forming the reactive Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical upon O-O bond
heterolysis. Additionally, Fe(III)-OOR intermediates have been proposed as
being competent oxidants themselves [46–48]. However, literature reports of
well-characterized Fe(III)-hydroperoxo (alkylperoxo) models are uncommon,
owing to their general instability in solution (even at low temperatures) and the
rapid formation of Fe(IV)-oxo/Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical species. Synthetic
methods
targeting
Fe(III)-hydroperoxo
(alkylperoxo)
complexes
generally
involve the addition of HOOR (R ¼ alkyl, acyl, or H) to an Fe(III) precursor at
low temperatures (< 60 C) in organic solvents (Figure 7). These reactions are
often performed under basic conditions to generate ROO to yield either a ﬁve-
or six-coordinate product. It has also been demonstrated that reduction of an
Fe(II)-superoxide followed by protonation can yield a hydroperoxide inter-
mediate, although these examples are rare [23, 54].
142
Yee and Tolman

Early model compound studies observed putative acyl and alkylperoxo
intermediates in reactions leading to Cpd I type species [49]. However, conclusive
characterization of these intermediates was lacking. These studies were able to
show that the observed species were ﬁve-coordinate and high-spin on the basis of
their electronic absorption, EPR, and 1H NMR spectra [50–52]. Compounds
18a–19 (Figure 8) were the ﬁrst six-coordinate examples [53–55] and differed
from their ﬁve-coordinate counterparts insofar as they displayed EPR spectra
characterized by a low g dispersion, consistent with a low-spin Fe(III) center and
similar to spectra reported for hydroperoxo (alkylperoxo) adducts of hemoglobin,
horseradish peroxidase, and bleomycin [56–58].
Axial ligand exchange was also demonstrated in the case of complex 20
(Figure 8), which was prepared by the addition of imidazole to a solution of the
hydroxide precursor [59].
Notwithstanding the above data, until fairly recently conclusive characterization
of the O-O and Fe-O bonding in Fe(III)-hydroperoxo (alkylperoxo) species was
lacking. The characterization of complexes 21a and 21b marked the ﬁrst reports of
reliable rR parameters for an Fe(III)-hydroperoxide intermediate [23, 38]. Bands
assigned to ν(Fe-O) and ν(O-O) were observed for both complexes near 570 and
810 cm1, respectively, consistent with an η1 binding mode for the HOO ligand.
Additionally, the EPR spectra of these complexes exhibited the low g-dispersion
characteristic
of
previously
reported
six-coordinate
Fe(III)-hydroperoxide
intermediates.
Interestingly, formation of 21a (Figure 8) required the presence of the pendant
imidazole, underscoring the importance of axial ligation in these systems. A role of
the axial ligand has been proposed to be to enhance the nucleophilicity of the O2 
2
moiety. This has been recently demonstrated for a non-heme Mn(III)-peroxo
complex, for which the authors postulate the axial ligand to facilitate the conver-
sion between the η2 and η1 conformations [60]. It was also shown for the

2-methyl-1,4-

the authors attributed to increased axial coordination at the Fe(III) center [61].
EPR studies have also demonstrated that changes in spin-state tend to accom-
pany coordination of an additional axial ligand for these systems, with ﬁve- and
six-coordinate species often being in high- and low-spin states, respectively [55].
These differences can have signiﬁcant mechanistic implications for O-O bond
cleavage. Product analysis for the decomposition of 22a and 22b (Figure 8) by
O-O bond cleavage revealed different mechanisms for each complex. Invoking a
thermodynamic argument, the authors reasoned that 22a, being in the high-spin
state, favors the homolytic pathway which proceeds via a high-spin transition state
to yield a high-spin Fe(IV)-oxo product, minimizing the energetic cost associated
with changes in spin. Similarly, 22b is low-spin and favors the heterolytic pathway
yielding an Fe(IV)-oxo π*-cation radical species as the ﬁnal product [62].

Fe(IV)-Oxo Intermediates
Synthetic (porphyrin)Fe(IV)-oxo complexes have long been sought in efforts to
understand and harness the oxidation chemistry of enzymes such as the cytochrome
P450’s. Over the past three to four decades, thorough spectroscopic characteriza-
tion has provided a good understanding of the electronic nature and structure of
these species. Representative examples of these complexes are shown below in
Figure 9. A brief overview of this early work will be given here as a preface to the
discussion of the reactivity of these species which has largely been the focus of
more recent efforts.
Compound 23a (Figure 9) is the earliest and most studied examples of a Cpd I
model, which was shown by Mo¨ssbauer and EPR studies to be an S ¼ 3/2 system,
in which a triplet Fe(IV) center is ferromagnetically coupled (J ¼ 43 cm1)

to an a2u porphyrin radical [63, 64]. Electron-withdrawing aryl rings (23b–e) have
been shown to weaken ferromagnetic interaction and even result in a change in
symmetry of the porphyrin radical (23e) from a2u to a1u as conﬁrmed by 1H NMR
and EPR studies [65, 66]. Electron-withdrawing substituents have also been
shown to prolong the lifetimes of these intermediates with respect to oxidative
degradation, allowing for the study of these compounds at temperatures well
above 50 C [62]. In contrast to their meso-substituted counterparts, β-substituted
Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radicals (24a–e) (Figure 9) have been characterized as
a1u porphyrin radicals weakly coupled with the Fe(IV) triplet state [65–67].
Interestingly, the electronic differences of the porphyrin systems in 23 and 24 do
not signiﬁcantly affect the Fe-O bond strength as reﬂected by their similar ν(Fe-O)
values [68]. The Fe-O bonding has been characterized by EXAFS and rR, which
have shown the Fe-O bond distance to be approximately 1.6 Å with values of
ν(Fe-O) in the range of 800–850 cm1 [69, 70]. These latter values are also
sensitive to axial coordination as well as electron-withdrawing aryl substituents,
which tend to result in negative shifts of ν(Fe-O) [63, 71–74].
Fe(IV)-oxo intermediates containing neutral porphyrin rings have also been
prepared (25a–c, 26, and 27) (Figure 9), and were ﬁrst observed in the decompo-
sition of (η1:η2-peroxo)diiron intermediates [75, 76]. More recently, electro-
chemical preparation of 27 has been achieved by the one-electron oxidation of
the Fe(III)-OH precursor [77]. Many structural similarities exist between these
species and their Cpd I cousins, particularly with regard to their Fe-O stretching
frequencies. Thus, the oxidation state of the porphyrin ring does not signiﬁcantly
affect the Fe-O bond strength [6].
2.2.5
Reactivity of Iron-Porphyrin Intermediates
Factors Affecting O-O Bond Cleavage: Heterolysis versus Homolysis
In Nature and in a number of synthetic systems, Fe(IV)-oxo intermediates are the
O-O bond cleavage products of Fe(III)-OOR species. As such, signiﬁcant efforts
have been made to ﬁnd out what factors determine the mode of O-O bond scission.
Product analysis studies carried out in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s demonstrated
that electron-deﬁcient porphyrin systems and protic/acidic reaction conditions
favored O-O bond heterolysis, while the opposite was true for O-O bond homolysis
[78–80]. The nature of the substituent of the hydroperoxide oxidant also was shown
to inﬂuence the mechanism of cleavage, with electron-withdrawing and electron-
donating groups favoring heterolytic and homolytic cleavage, respectively [81].
A number of subsequent studies on the reactivity of Fe(IV)-oxo species have
indirectly conﬁrmed these results [82–84].
Two more recent studies [85, 86] have sought to further characterize the nature
of the observed pH dependence of these systems. While it had been postulated that a
mechanistic changeover was the result of acid-base effects or changes in speciation
of the reacting Fe(III) complexes, it was found that the observed reactivity
146
Yee and Tolman

correlates
well
with
the
pH
dependence
of
E’(FeIV/III)
and
E’(P+•/P)
(P ¼ porphyrin). These results were interpreted to be consistent with the notion
that pH-dependent redox equilibria may in fact mask the true identity of the
oxidation products, especially if product analysis is the method of identiﬁcation
[85]. Interestingly, further investigation using rapid-scan UV-vis experiments
performed at low temperature and under conditions of excess oxidant only showed
formation of the Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical in the pH ranges studied (pH ¼ 6.3–
11.4), indicating that, for the complexes studied, O-O bond cleavage only proceeds
via heterolysis when meta-chlorobenzoic acid (m-CPBA) is the oxidant [86].
Under basic conditions (pH >8, Figure 10) further reaction of the Fe(IV)-oxo π*
cation-radical was observed to generate the one electron reduced Fe(IV)-oxo
species as well as regenerate some of the starting Fe(III) precursor. These ﬁndings
are consistent with the fact that under basic conditions (pH >7) the Fe(IV)-oxo
form is electrochemically more stable than the Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical
[85]. The authors propose that under basic conditions, reaction of the Fe(IV)-oxo
π* cation-radical with RO (R¼H, CH3) likely generates a reduced Fe(III)-OOR
species which can then undergo homolysis to form the observed Fe(IV)-oxo
intermediate or lose ROO to reform the starting Fe(III) precursor [86]. These
ﬁndings highlight the importance of the nature of the oxidant as well as the reaction
conditions in dictating the mechanism of O-O bond cleavage.
Alkane Hydroxylation by Fe(IV)-Oxo Intermediates
Alkane hydroxylation by Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical species has been well
studied, although few models have come close to reproducing the reactivity towards
C-H bonds observed in the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Recently, compound 29

(Figure 11) has been shown to be a highly reactive hydroxylating agent for
xanthene, ﬂuorene, and benzoic acid substrates, with rate constants similar to
those observed for Cpd I of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP119 [87].
Kinetic analyses were performed using single-mixing stopped-ﬂow UV-vis
measurements to observe the reaction between mixtures of 28 and m-CPBA with
substrate at 14.5 C. A linear correlation was observed between log(k) for alkane
hydroxylation and the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the C-H bond, indica-
tive of rate-limiting C-H bond breaking [87]. While the origin of high kinetic
reactivity is unknown, the authors postulate that both a low-lying a2u porphyrin
HOMO and higher spin states (Figure 12), made accessible from the electron
deﬁciency of the porphyrin system, may result in diminished reaction barriers via
spin-crossing along the reaction coordinate, similar to that observed for Mn(V)-oxo
complexes supported by analogous porphyrin systems [87, 88]. Theoretical calcu-
lations performed for a variety of P450 models support the possibility of such a
scenario provided that signiﬁcant lowering of transition state energies can be
achieved [89], as is proposed for 29.
Carbon-hydrogen bond activation by Fe(IV)-oxo species (Figure 13) has also
recently been demonstrated, albeit with more activated substrates and at much
lower rates than their Cpd I analogues [90]. Compounds 31–33 were generated at
15 C and subsequently treated with substrate. Large kinetic isotope effects (KIEs)
were observed (KIE ¼ 20 and 21 for DHA and xanthene, respectively) and linear
correlations between log(k) and BDECH were measured, indicative of an H-atom
abstraction mechanism [90]. In comparing 31–33, compound 31 with the more
electron-deﬁcient porphyrin system was found to be the stronger oxidant, while by
the same token, 33 was shown to be the weakest. Interestingly, in a previous report
the order of reactivity for 31–33 was reversed for the oxidation of styrene and
benzyl alcohol. The authors also observed a suppression of reactivity when an
excess of the starting Fe(III) precursors was added. It was proposed that these
results together seemed to indicate a disproportionation of the formed Fe(IV)-oxo

species to give the corresponding Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical intermediate and the
Fe(III) precursor, and that in fact the Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical species was
the active oxidizing agent. However, this hypothesis is speculative, as this species
was not directly observed [91].
The generally accepted mechanism for alkane hydroxylation by Fe(IV)-oxo π*
cation-radical intermediates is known as the “oxygen rebound” pathway [92, 93] and
is outlined in Figure 14. The mechanism proceeds by initial, rate-limiting H-atom
abstraction from the substrate to generate an intermediate Fe(IV)-OH (Cpd II) and
alkyl-radical species. Kinetic studies have revealed large KIEs indicative of a signif-
icant tunneling contribution and consistent with the involvement of rate limiting C-H
bond cleavage [92, 94–96]. Subsequent recombination of the alkyl and hydroxyl
radicals (the latter originating from the Fe(IV)-OH intermediate) is proposed to occur
via a “rebound” process, yielding the hydroxylated product bound to the Fe(III)
center as has been isolated for P450cam (Section 2.1) [94]. The involvement of a
short-lived radical intermediate is supported on the basis of stereochemical and allylic
scrambling observed during the oxidation of a number of substrates by both enzy-
matic [92] and synthetic systems [97].
There has been a long-standing controversy as to whether or not hydroxylation
occurs exclusively via a radical rebound process. Some have proposed the involve-
ment of multiple oxidants on the basis of ultra-fast radical clock experiments, which
have provided a disparate range of rate constants for the rebound process [93]. In
addition, these studies have provided evidence for the involvement of cationic
intermediates in addition to radical species. Another theory which has been argued
on the basis of computational evidence invokes the involvement of multiple spin-
states for which the activation barriers to rebound differ signiﬁcantly, and as a result
yield signiﬁcantly different rates [98]. A multi-state reactivity scenario has also
been argued for non-heme Fe(IV)-oxo systems [99, 100].

O-Atom Transfer Reactivity
Fe(III) heme complexes have long been known to be efﬁcient O-atom transfer
catalysts, particularly for oleﬁn epoxidation [101]. Examples of sulfur [82, 102],
nitrogen [103], and phosphorus [76] oxidation have also been observed. It was
originally proposed that epoxidation was carried out by an Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-
radical species [101]. Since then, this chemistry has been more thoroughly explored
and demonstrated for a variety of catalysts and oxidants including PhIO [101, 104],
H2O2 [105], and HOOR [106, 107] in which the involvement of Fe(IV)-oxo and
Fe(III)-OOH intermediates have also been proposed [103, 108, 109].
Recent studies of Fe(III)X/H2O2 systems in alcoholic solvents have provided
insight regarding the epoxidation reactivity of Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical
intermediates [83] (Figure 15). Binding of H2O2 was shown to be preceded by loss
of X and coordination by the alcohol solvent. O-O bond cleavage follows, which has
been proposed to occur both hetero- and homolytically to generate Fe(IV)-oxo π*
cation-radical and putative Fe(IV)-hydroxo/Fe(IV)-oxo intermediates, respectively
[80]. In these systems, the homolysis products are not believed to be involved in the
epoxidation chemistry. As for other peroxide oxidants, the mechanism of O-O bond
cleavage was found to be dependent on the acidity of the solvent [110] as well as on
the electron-withdrawing/donating natures of the oxidant [81] and porphyrin system
[108]. Additionally, both the rate of H2O2 consumption and O-O bond heterolysis
were shown to increase with increasing alcohol concentration [110], supporting the
intermediacy of a Fe(III) alcohol adduct. A mechanism for the O-atom transfer and
epoxide formation has been proposed from both experimental and DFT studies,
which involves initial rate determining electrophilic attack at the oleﬁn by the oxo
moiety to form an Fe(IV)-substrate radical intermediate [111, 112]. Subsequent ring
closure yields the epoxide product coordinated to the Fe(III) center of the resting
state. Similar to the hydroxylation reactivity for these models, DFT studies also
suggest a two-state reactivity scenario for epoxidation, with major differences
between the two pathways being the barrier to ring closure, which is almost negligible
for the doublet state and slightly higher for the quartet state [112–114].
O-atom transfer by Fe(IV)-oxo and Fe(III)-OOR intermediates has also been
demonstrated [109]. Recent investigation into the reactivity of Fe(III)(m-CPBA)
(compound 34, Figure 16) has shown this species to be capable of O-atom transfer
to cis-stilbene and dimethyl sulﬁde at 15 C in acetonitrile [82]. Both reactions
were found to be highly dependent on the reaction conditions (aprotic solvents,
temperature, equivalents of oxidant) and were shown to be accelerated under
conditions of excess substrate. O-atom transfer occurs in competition with O-O
bond heterolysis, which predominates under conditions of excess oxidant to
generate the corresponding Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical species.
On the basis of the observed rate constants, the authors argue that competitive
substrate oxidation by 34 in the presence of 35 (Figure 16) is only possible at
extremely high equivalents of substrate (>5000 eq). Additional DFT studies provided
evidence that argues against the co-participation of an Fe(III)-OOH intermediate
alongside Fe(IV)-oxo π* cation-radical species [115], so the involvement of
this species is only relevant in aprotic solvents and under conditions that inhibit
O-O bond heterolysis.

Role of the Axial Ligand in Hydroxylation and O-Atom Transfer Reactions
For a number of model systems, coordination of an anionic axial ligand has
been shown to have a sometimes drastic effect on epoxidation and hydroxylation
reactivity. Consistently these ﬁndings seem to demonstrate that increased electron
donation to the iron center results in markedly faster rates [116, 118]. However,
the origin of this increased reactivity is still somewhat unclear. Electrochemical
studies [112] have shown that axial ligands which are known to be stronger donors
actually increase the value of E1/2(P+•/P) for these intermediates, which is both
counterintuitive and in disagreement with calculated values of E1/2(P+•/P) [117]
that display an opposite trend.
Other DFT studies have found that the major effect of the axial ligand is to
increase the basicity of the oxo moiety, thereby strengthening the FeO-H bond that
results from H-atom abstraction, and weakening the Fe-O bonding, which encour-
ages O-atom transfer [118]. However, the lack of a linear correlation between
values of ν(Fe-O) and rates of epoxidation still remains to be explained. Recent
calculations have conﬁrmed a linear correlation between the O-H BDE of the
corresponding Fe(IV)-hydroxo species and the barrier heights of a variety of
reactions, including aromatic hydroxylation [119], oleﬁn epoxidation [120], and
sulfoxidation [121], all of which in part implicate the basicity of the oxo moiety as
being a key factor. Still other recent experimental and theoretical evidence suggests
that strong axial ligation serves to stabilize the ground state of the Fe(III) product
resulting from these reactions, which in turn leads to a stabilization of the transition
state and an enhancement of reactivity. This hypothesis is supported by an observed
linear correlation between values of E1/2(FeIII/FeII) and ln(k2) for the epoxidation of
cyclooctene [112].

Iron-Porphyrin/Copper Complexes
as Cytochrome c Oxidase Models
In biology, cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) plays a crucial role as the terminal oxidant
in aerobic respiration. Speciﬁcally, the enzyme utilizes the electrons from the
electron transport chain to carry out the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to
water, which is performed at a dinuclear active site consisting of an iron heme
center and a copper center. Remarkably, the native enzyme performs the 4e
reduction of O2 to H2O with >99 % selectivity relative to the generation of partially
reduced oxygen species (PROS). Much as in the case of heme-O2 chemistry,
synthetic modeling has focused on two primary areas: the characterization of
(μ-peroxo)iron-copper intermediates and studies of catalytic O2 reduction and
reactivity. As will be discussed, both approaches use very different methods and
offer complementary perspectives.

2.3.1
(μ-Peroxo)Iron-Copper Intermediates
Initial efforts to model CcO were focused on preparing analogs of the “resting
state” of the enzyme, which features Fe(III) and Cu(II) centers [122]. These early
studies were more directed towards electronic characterization of the resting state,
however, and it was not until the reduced form of the enzyme was modeled that
reactivity with O2 was observed. One of the ﬁrst examples of O2 reduction for such
model compounds is described in Figure 17, in which a mixture of 36 and 37 in
dichloromethane was treated with a stoichiometric amount of O2 at 80 C [123].
Compound 38 was isolated upon warming to 0 C followed by treatment of the
reaction solution with heptane. Other μ-oxo complexes with iron and copper have
been prepared in addition to 38 [124, 125], which may suggest that such species
have roles as intermediates in the catalytic cycle of CcO. Importantly, this example
suggested the efﬁcacy of these complexes in promoting complete O2 reduction.
Since this early work, a number of examples of (μ-peroxo)iron-copper interme-
diates have been generated and studied spectroscopically for a variety of ligand
systems, some of which are featured in Figure 18. The ﬁrst and only crystallo-
graphic report of a (μ-peroxo)iron-copper complex (44) appeared in 2003, and
revealed an η2:η1 coordination for the iron and copper centers, respectively [126].
Resonance Raman and EXAFS spectroscopy have also conﬁrmed such coordi-
nation in solution for complexes 39–41 [127]. Reducing the denticity of the ligands
on the Cu site from four to three resulted in η2:η2 coordination of the peroxo bridge,
as shown for complexes 42 and 43. This change in coordination is evidenced by a

decrease in ν(O-O) by approximately 30–50 cm1, indicative of O-O bond
weakening [128, 129]. Further study of complexes 40 and 42 by DFT calculations
showed this decrease in ν(O-O) to be the result of efﬁcient backbonding from the
copper center into the σ* orbital of the peroxo ligand in the case of the η2:η2 binding
conﬁguration. Given the conformational restraints of the copper supporting ligand
for compound 40, such backbonding does not occur [130].

Axial ligation at the heme center has also been demonstrated to have an effect
on the binding mode of the peroxo bridge. In a recent example, addition of
1,5-dicyclohexylimidazole (DCHim) to compound 42 (Figure 18) was shown to
result in the fully end-on η1:η1 coordination of the O2 
2
moiety to both metal centers
(45), which was supported on the basis of rR, EXAFS, and UV-vis spectroscopy
[131]. Values of ν(O-O) and ν(Fe-O) for 45 are similar to those observed for the
η2:η1 bound species. Interestingly, the addition of dicyclohexylimidazole (DCHim)
and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to compound 40 only resulted in the dissoci-
ation of the complex and the loss of O2 [130].
In each of these examples, the Fe(III) and Cu(II) centers have been shown to be
anti-ferromagnetically coupled via the peroxo bridge, which serves as the conduit
for superexchange between iron and copper [130]. In the case of compound 45
(Figure 18), axial ligation of the heme iron center leads to the unique example of a
low-spin (μ-η1:η1-peroxo)Fe(III)-Cu(II) species, analogous to that observed in
heme-hydroperoxo chemistry (see Section 2.2.3). Modeling of this species by
DFT has demonstrated the groundstate for this complex to be dependent on the
Fe-O-O-Cu dihedral angle (Θ), which effectively dictates the nature of the
Cu-peroxo interaction, and thus the nature of the coupling between the two metal
centers (Figure 19) [132]. For Θ < 150, the spins located on the iron and the copper
interact with the same π* orbital of the peroxo bridge (π*ν); however, for
150 < Θ < 180, the Cu 3dx
2-y
2 orbital interacts with the π*σ orbital of the peroxo
moiety, effectively closing the superexchange pathway and resulting in a ferromag-
netically coupled adduct [132].

Recent kinetic studies have sought to better characterize the mechanism of O2
activation to yield (μ-peroxo)iron-copper adducts, a key question being whether
O2 binds ﬁrst to Fe or to Cu. Stopped-ﬂow UV-vis measurements below 90 C
revealed the formation of a heme-superoxo adduct upon addition of O2 to the
non-oxygenated precursors of 40 and 43 (Figure 18), which were conﬁrmed on
the basis of rR and Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy [133, 134]. Such intermediates have
also been observed in other model systems [140]. In contrast, some studies of the
native enzyme have proposed that initial O2 binding occurs instead at the copper
center, and that the subsequent formation of a myoglobin-like heme-O2 adduct
results from O2 transfer from the copper site to the Fe(II) heme center [135].
Results from a more recent study of 41a (Figure 20) suggest that a primary
role of the copper center is to assist in the binding of O2 to the iron center.
This conclusion is largely supported on the basis of comparison to 46a, which
reacts slower than its dinuclear counterpart [136]. In aqueous systems, the presence
of copper has also been suggested to play a role in protecting the iron center against
the coordination of water, which has been shown to signiﬁcantly inhibit the binding
of O2 by effecting a high- to low-spin crossover [137].

the earliest and most studied functional CcO models, boasting perhaps the closest
structural and functional likeness of CcO for any model system. In a seminal study,
the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 was demonstrated for all three compounds
under physiologically relevant conditions (i.e., at potentials between 0 and
300 mV versus NHE and pH ¼ 7) [138].

Two key features of these catalysts are their high selectivity for the 4e
reduction of O2 (and thus their limited generation of PROS) as well as their
robustness as evidenced by their high turnover numbers (1.2(2)  104  TON at
200 mV, pH <8). From these studies, a catalytic mechanism was proposed (Fig-
ure 22) [139]. Importantly, O2 reduction occurs as proposed for mononuclear heme
complexes, with the copper center functioning mainly to enhance O2 binding (vide
supra) and transfer electrons (vide infra). Also of note is that protonation of the
peroxo species to generate the hydroperoxo intermediate is slow relative to O-O
bond cleavage. This disparity has the effect of maintaining a low steady state
concentration of the hydroperoxo species, mitigating the loss of H2O2 which
might occur via hydrolysis of this species [122, 138].
More recent efforts have been focused on studying the role of the covalently
linked tyrosine (Tyr244) in the CcO catalytic cycle by single turnover experiments
performed in the presence of exogenous and appended phenols. In one of the ﬁrst of
Figure 22 Proposed mechanism for the electrocatalytic 4e reduction of O2 carried out by 47a-c

kinetically invisible under the studied conditions.

these studies, compound 47c (Figure 21) was shown by EPR spectroscopy to
generate phenoxyl radicals when treated with exogenous 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol
derivatives in dichloromethane at room temperature [140]. A KIE of 2 was mea-
sured, implicating proton transfer in the rate determining step, which the authors
argued as evidence of an intermediate hydroperoxo species. In a subsequent study,
phenol appended 48 (Figure 21) was also able to achieve full reduction of O2 in
a single-turnover process, and it was argued that the pendant phenol participates as
an H-atom donor in a manner similar to that proposed for exogenously added
phenols [141]. In both cases, the authors invoke the formation of an Fe(IV)-oxo
species, resulting from heterolysis of the proposed hydroperoxo intermediate that is
facilitated by electron transfer from the nearby Cu(I) center. The presence of an
Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate was supported on the basis of its O-atom transfer reactivity
with triphenylphosphine, which gave triphenylphosphine oxide in high yields, in
addition to evidence from mass spectrometry [140, 141]. Taken together, the results
of these studies demonstrate the efﬁcacy of tyrosine mimics to participate as redox
centers in the 4e reduction of O2.
Furthering this implication of Tyr244 as a key player in catalysis by CcO,
catalytic O2 reduction was investigated for a series of complexes (49a–c)
(Figure 21) appended onto mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coated gold
electrodes under conditions of rate limiting electron-transfer in conjunction with
rotating ring-disk voltammetry. It was found that under conditions of rate-limiting
electron transfer, both the pendant phenol and copper center were necessary for
minimizing the generation of PROS, suggesting that a key role of these redox sites
is to serve as electron reservoirs in order to mitigate their buildup. Such a scenario is
similar to that observed in the native enzyme, in which electron transfer to the
active site is believed to be relatively slow on the timescale of O2 reduction.
In contrast, when electron transfer was not rate-limiting, the selectivities among
the different catalysts were much less disparate, further supporting the electron
transfer role of the distal Tyr244 and the copper center [142].
Catalytic O2 reduction has also been demonstrated in the case of compounds 48
(Figure 21) and 41a (Figure 20) using chemical reductants, namely cytochrome
c and decamethylferrocene (Fc*). Mechanistically, the 4e reduction of O2
proceeds in essentially the same manner regardless of the electron source (chemical
versus electrolytic; Figure 22). Catalysis with 48 performed at a 2 % catalyst
loading in a 1:1 water:acetonitrile mixture (pH ¼ 7) at 25 C was shown to be
stoichiometric with respect to the reductant [143]. Interestingly, O2 binding was
shown to be rate limiting as opposed to electron transfer in this case, in contrast to
what is proposed in the native enzyme [142]. Under the experimental conditions,
the poor solubility of cytochrome c limited the number of turnovers to 25.
The catalytic mechanism for 41a (Figure 20) is thought to proceed in much the
same way (Figure 23), with O2 binding being rate limiting at 25 C [136]. In contrast
to 48 (Figure 21) however, catalysis was carried out in acetone, which allowed for
the reaction to be studied at 60 C.
160
Yee and Tolman

At low temperature, the rate-determining step switches from O2 binding to O-O
bond cleavage, which allowed for the monitoring and characterization of the
hydroperoxo intermediate by UV-vis spectroscopy. Importantly, comparison of
the rates of O-O bond cleavage in the case of 41a (Figure 20) and its copper-free
analog revealed negligible differences, further evidence that the distal copper center
is not involved in O-O bond heterolysis [136].

Dioxygen Activation by Non-heme Iron Complexes
Non-heme iron active sites are found in numerous enzymes that play critical roles in
life processes. The literature describing structural, spectroscopic, and mechanistic
studies of these enzymes is expansive, with much of it accessible through a number
of comprehensive reviews [144–149] and more focused accounts [150–165].
The non-heme active sites may be divided into two broad categories deﬁned by
whether they contain either one or two iron atoms. Typically, non-heme iron centers
are bound to the protein by a combination of histidine and carboxylate ligands, with
additional ligation by tyrosines, water molecules, hydroxide/oxo groups, and/or a
cofactor such as α-ketoglutarate. The structural diversity and varied functions of
these active sites are impressive, providing a fertile area for research aimed at
understanding structure/function relationships. We summarize a few highlights
here, with the speciﬁc aim of providing context for the most current synthetic
modeling work targeting the dioxygen activation chemistry of these sites.
In general, the O2 binding and activation pathways followed by non-heme
monoiron enzymes parallel that of their heme counterparts (Section 2), but there
are notable differences that arise from the presence of cis coordination sites and/or

bound cofactors in the non-heme systems. For example, differences in active site
structures correlate with divergent regiospeciﬁcity and mechanisms in the intradiol
and extradiol catechol oxygenases (Figure 24) [145, 146, 155]. In the former, the
iron remains as Fe(III) throughout the catalytic cycle, and upon binding as a dianion
the substrate catecholate is activated by the Fe(III) ion for direct attack by O2 (e.g.,
via the form semiquinone-Fe(II)). The resulting alkylperoxo intermediate then
undergoes a Criegee-type rearrangement to afford an anhydride that opens to the
ﬁnal diacid product. In the extradiol oxygenases, the substrate is proposed to bind as
a monoanion to an Fe(II) center, which then binds O2 to yield an adduct identiﬁed
as an Fe(III)-superoxide on the basis of X-ray crystallographic [166], spectroscopic
[167], and theoretical [168] work.

Similar adducts also are proposed for other members of the family of enzymes
that feature the supporting 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad as a common structural
motif. The subsequent fate of the Fe(III)-superoxo moiety varies (Figure 25),
however, and includes rearrangement and reduction to an η2-(hydro)peroxo species
(Rieske dioxygenases, “Intraprotein ET”) [169], hydrogen atom abstraction from
substrate (isopenicillin N-synthase, “HAT”) [170], and intramolecular attack at
bound α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) cofactor to induce its oxidative decarboxylation
(α-KG-dependent monooxygenases, “Nucleophilic Attack”) [145, 146, 171].
In the Rieske dioxygenases and the α-KG-dependent monooxygenases, O-O bond
scission processes yield the active oxidants, proposed for the former to be an
iron-oxo-hydroxo unit and for the latter as an Fe(IV)-oxo.
A milestone discovery was the trapping and unambiguous identiﬁcation of
the reactive Fe(IV)-oxo unit in the taurine/α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD)
[172, 173]. Related pathways are implicated for non-heme iron enzymes that are
supported by three histidine ligands instead of the 2-His-1-carboxylate triad [174],

such as cysteine dioxygenase [175–177] and β-diketone dioxygenase [178].
Also notable is the chemistry of a low-spin Fe(III)-OOH species identiﬁed in the
anticancer drug bleomycin, which may perform hydrogen atom abstraction
from deoxyribonucleic acid directly or via prior O-O bond scission pathways
[179, 180]. The diverse mechanisms by which O2 is activated by the non-heme
monoiron active sites is striking, and raises many fundamental questions about how
ligand environment inﬂuences O2 binding, reactivity, and reduction that model
studies have aimed to address [181].
Proposed structures for key intermediates involved in dioxygen activation by
non-heme diiron enzymes are shown in Figure 26. Intermediate P is the result of
dioxygen binding to the diiron(II) active sites of several non-heme diiron enzymes
[158], compound Q is generated from P and is proposed to be the active oxidant in
soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) [158, 182], and intermediate X is the
species proposed to generate a tyrosyl radical involved in catalysis by the diiron-
containing ribonucleotide reductase [149, 183]. Identiﬁcation of each of these
intermediates, the detailed structures of which continue to be debated, has relied
upon interpretation of spectroscopic data that has been greatly informed by detailed
studies of synthetic model complexes.

Monoiron Models of Mononuclear Non-heme Iron

Efforts to synthesize and characterize models of non-heme monoiron active sites
involved in dioxygen activation have been extensive and wide-ranging, with numer-
ous strategies having been taken to isolate reactive intermediates relevant to the
biological systems. A number of reviews are available that describe the advances
made to date in quite comprehensive fashion [145, 155, 161, 184–187]. We focus

here on selected recent contributions that describe the characterization of putative
superoxo, hydroperoxo, and oxo intermediates involved in O2 activation pathways,
and on efforts to understand the O2 reactivity of monoiron-cofactor complexes.
3.1.1
Monoiron Superoxo and Hydroperoxo Complexes
Stimulated by evidence from studies of various biological systems that non-heme
monoiron-superoxo complexes may be capable of attacking substrate C-H
bonds [150], attempts have been made to identify such complexes in synthetic
systems and characterize their reactivity. In early work, an iron-superoxo moiety
was characterized as a transient intermediate in the oxygenation of a bis(μ-hydroxo)
diiron(II,II) complex to ultimately yield a (1,2-peroxo)diiron species [188].
This intermediate exhibited a notably high ν(O-O) band at 1310 cm1, and
end-on binding of the superoxo ligand was proposed on the basis of the results of
18O-isotope labeling experiments. A related iron-superoxo complex was proposed
upon oxygenation of Fe(II) species bound to dendrimer-appended carboxylates,
although no direct evidence of a superoxo ligand was provided [189].
In a more recent study, a variety of observations were interpreted to indicate
the intermediacy of an iron(II)-superoxo species from the oxygenation of an iron(II)-
benzoylformate
complex

that

α-KG-dependent
monooxygenase active sites [163]. A similar intermediate was proposed in studies
of an Fe(II)-acetylacetone model of β-diketone dioxygenase [190]. Indirect evidence
for the intermediacy of an iron(II)-superoxo complex was also cited in studies of 52
(Figure 27), which reacted with O2 only in the presence of reductant and proton
donors [191] or substrates with weak C-H bonds [192] to yield iron(III)-hydroperoxo
or iron(IV)-oxo species. Mechanistic studies were interpreted to support a pathway

involving pre-equilibrium formation of 53, which then reacts with reductants/proton
sources or attacks the allylic positions of oleﬁn substrates. Insights into this reactivity
have been provided by theory [193]. In sum, while some data on non-heme iron(II)-
superoxo species have been obtained, full characterization remains an unachieved
goal [194].
Many examples of monoiron(III)-hydroperoxo species have been reported, with
typical syntheses involving reactions of Fe(III) precursors with H2O2 [145, 195,
196]. The reactivity of such intermediates prepared in this way has come under
particular scrutiny of late [197] due to the discovery of selective catalytic oxida-
tions by iron complexes with H2O2 [198–200]. More rare is the identiﬁcation of
monoiron(III)-hydroperoxo species from reactions of Fe(II) complexes with O2 via
processes that directly model dioxygen activation by metalloprotein active sites. In
one example, the aforementioned monoiron-superoxo complex formed from oxy-
genation of a bis(μ-hydroxo)diiron(II,II) complex decays to a transient species
hypothesized on the basis of resonance Raman spectroscopy to be a highly reactive
complex with a Fe(III)-OOH unit; it decays rapidly to a (1,2-peroxo)diiron(III,III)
product [188]. In another notable case, reaction of a multi-iron(II) polyoxometalate
with O2 yielded a stable complex that was identiﬁed as having end-on coordination
of two hydroperoxo groups in unprecedented linear geometries at the two terminal
positions of the polyoxometalate “belt” (Figure 28) [201]. A rather long O-O
distance in the reported X-ray crystal structure (1.612(9) Å) was rationalized by
the presence of multiple hydrogen bonding interactions with water molecules.
While alkyl- or acylperoxo complexes are clearly related to hydroperoxo
species, we choose to forego discussion of them here because they are not derived
directly from O2. However, in recent work that is relevant to the reactivity of
FeOOH species, the decay of a high-spin non-heme Fe(III) alkylperoxo complex
to a Fe(IV)¼O species was studied and shown to involve O-O bond homolysis
induced by binding of an axial anionic ligand [202].

3.1.2
Monoiron(IV)-Oxo Complexes
The deﬁnition of the structure of a non-heme monoiron(IV)-oxo complex by X-ray
crystallography in 2003 [203] has heralded more than a decade of intense research
into the properties and reactivity of such species. Results from these studies have
been summarized most thoroughly in a recent review [187], but also in others [186,
200, 204, 205]; we will not reproduce those discussions here, and instead will
brieﬂy mention selected, more recently reported advances.
Notable attention has been drawn to studies of the reactivity of discrete
monoiron(IV)-oxo complexes. Both low-spin (S ¼ 1) and high-spin (S ¼ 2) com-
plexes have been characterized, and the latter has been found to be more reactive
than the former with respect to reactions with C-H bonds. Interestingly, it has
recently been reported that addition of Sc3+ or HClO4 signiﬁcantly perturbs the
reactivity of the originally reported S ¼ 1 complexes 54 and 55 (Figure 29).
For example, a 120-fold acceleration in the rate of oxidation of a benzyl alcohol
was observed upon addition of Sc(OTf)3 to 54 in CH3CN, with an accompanying
signiﬁcant decrease in the H/D KIE [206]. These and other results were interpreted
to support a change in mechanism from concerted HAT in the absence of Sc3+ to
stepwise Sc3+-coupled electron-transfer followed by proton-transfer. A similar
mechanistic shift was proposed for the oxidations of toluene derivatives by 54 in
the presence of HClO4 [207]. In addition, 55 performed as a 1-electron oxidant of
ferrocene in the absence of added Sc3+, but as a 2-electron oxidant in its presence
[208]. All of these effects were attributed to the coordination of Sc3+ or H+ to
the Fe(IV)¼O unit, with support for this notion coming from an X-ray crystal
structure proposed to show [(OTf)4ScOH]2 bound to the Fe(IV)¼O moiety in 56
(Figure 29) [208]. This interpretation has been called into question on the basis of
theoretical calculations that indicate the complex is more likely an Fe(III)-oxo
bound to [(OTf)4Sc(OH2)]1 (57) [209].

In another recent mechanistic study, the reactivity of Fe(IV)¼O and Fe(IV)¼NTs
(Ts ¼ tosyl) units at parity of supporting ligand (N4Py ¼ N,N-bis(2-pyridyl-methyl)-
N-bis(2-pyridyl)methylamine) was compared [210]. The oxo complex was found to
perform HAT faster than the tosylimido compound, but to be less efﬁcient at
sulfoxidation of thioanisoles. These differences were attributed to steric effects asso-
ciated with approach of substrate to the reactive Fe(IV)¼O and Fe(IV)¼NTs units.
Interest also has been focused on even more oxidized species, such as complexes
with Fe(V)¼O or (L•)Fe(IV)¼O (akin to the heme relative Cpd I; Figure 2), partic-
ularly in view of the postulates that such species may be involved in dihydroxylations
by the Rieske dioxygenases and related model compounds [169, 200]. In a notable
recent example, the complexes 58–60 (Figure 30) were found to catalyze the oxida-
tion of light alkanes by potassium peroxymonosulfate (oxone), and spectroscopic and
theoretical evidence was presented in support of the involvement of 61 (Figure 30) as
the active species [211]. In another example, evidence from variable temperature
mass spectrometry led to the identiﬁcation of a metastable Fe(V)(O)(OH) complex
generated from reaction of an Fe(II) precursor with H2O2 [212].

cleavage selectivities in O2 reactions of Fe(III) complexes of bound catecholates
(usually 2,4-di-tertbutyl-catecholate, DBC2) have been explored extensively in the
past few years [213–225] (Figure 31). Notable ﬁndings include a positive correlation
of the reaction rates with the energy of catecholate! Fe(III) LMCT transitions
[213, 222], an inverse correlation with the redox potentials of the DBSQ/DBC2
couple (DBSQ ¼ 2,4-di-tertbutyl-semiquinone) in the complexes [213, 225], and
signiﬁcant changes in extradiol versus intradiol selectivity as a function of solvent
medium [216, 217]. Notwithstanding this work, intermediates in these reactions have
not been identiﬁed and the fundamental mechanistic basis for intradiol versus
extradiol cleavage selectivity remains unclear.
In efforts to model the α-KG-dependent enzymes, numerous complexes of
α-ketocarboxylates, with benzoylformate (BF) being the most commonly used,
have been prepared and their reactions with O2 studied [145]. Yet only in a few
cases has decarboxylation of the bound α-ketocarboxylate been accompanied by
oxidation of a substrate in a reaction that would model enzyme function (Figure 32).
In an early example, reaction of complex 62 with O2 in the presence of cyclohexene
or cis-stilbene resulted in decarboxylation of BF and formation of epoxides
[226]. Complex 63a reacted with O2 to yield a product in which the ortho position
of one of the phenyl substituents was hydroxylated [227]; a similar intramolecular
hydroxylation was observed for a phenylpyruvate analog (63b) [228].

In subsequent work, the oxidant responsible for this intramolecular process (pre-
sumably an Fe(IV)-oxo species) was trapped by exogenous substrates, and the extent
of trapping was found to be determined by the molecular shape of the substrate and
the strength of the C-H bond being attacked [229]. More recently, decarboxylation of
BF and sulfoxidation reactions were observed upon oxygenation of 64 (Figure 32) in
the presence of dimethyl sulﬁde or dimethyl sulfoxide [230]. In a potentially useful
extension of these studies, 65 immobilized on gold nanoparticles reacted with O2 in
the presence of various substrates to yield oxidized products, and initial demonstra-
tion of catalytic activity in the presence of excess BF was demonstrated [231].

Diiron Models of Dinuclear Non-heme
Diiron Active Sites
With the aim of shedding light on the properties of the intermediates proposed
during O2 activation by the non-heme diiron enzymes, numerous strategies have
been used to target peroxo- and oxo-diiron complexes for synthesis and character-
ization. We point the reader to comprehensive reviews for summaries of the
approaches taken and successes achieved [232–237]. In the sections below, recent
advances toward the characterization of (peroxo)diiron(III,III) complexes that

model intermediate P (or Hperoxo) in the enzymes, diiron(III,IV) complexes
that model intermediate X in ribonucleotide reductase, and diiron(IV,IV)
complexes relevant to the active oxidant Q in sMMO are summarized. Particular
focus is placed on notable new insights into the interconversions among such
species that are directly relevant to dioxygen activation pathways in the enzymes.
3.2.1
(Peroxo)diiron Complexes
Building upon earlier reports of the structures and properties of (μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron
complexes such as 66–68 (Figure 33), efforts more recently have focused on identi-
fying such species as intermediates in catalytic oxidations, probing rearrangements
involving other bridging ligands, and examining their O-O bond breaking reactions
that lead to higher valent diiron compounds. For example, a transient species
formulated as a (μ-oxo)(μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III,III) complex was identiﬁed via spec-
troscopy in studies of oxidations using H2O2 with a tridentate, meridional N-donor
ligand [238]. However, the authors surmised that an unidentiﬁed species derived from
the observed intermediate was likely the actual oxidant in the catalytic reactions. In
related work, a (μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III,III) species proposed to lack the additional
oxo-bridge was identiﬁed in studies of H2O2 disproportionation [239].
The effects of varying the bridging ligand on the properties of (μ-1,2-peroxo)-
diiron(III,III) complexes 69 were examined (Figure 34), and in early work it was
proposed that rearrangement occurred such that the bridging ligand shifted from
bidentate bridging to monodentate on one metal ion [240]. The propensity for these
rearrangements, which resemble “carboxylate shifts” proposed to be important
in diiron enzyme reactivity [241], was linked to the bite angle preferred by the

2 ligand, with the larger angle for X ¼ Me2As better stabilizing the triply
bridged form of 69a. Subsequent spectroscopic and kinetic studies explored these
and other factors in greater detail [242]. In addition, a similar rearrangement
involving conversion of a carboxylate from bridging to terminal monodentate
in (μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III,III) species 69b was reported to be induced by
protonation [243].
Protonation is thought to facilitate scission of the O-O bond in (peroxo)diiron
intermediates to generate active oxidants in enzymes like soluble methane
monooxygenase (sMMO) [244]. In work aimed at understanding how this might
occur, reactions of (μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III,III) complexes with protic acids have
been explored. Treatment of 70 (Figure 35) with HClO4 or HNO3 was shown to
result in initial protonation of the oxo bridge (71), followed by decay to the (μ-oxo)-
diiron(III,IV) complex 72 that models intermediate X in ribonucleotide reductase
[245]. Mechanistic details such as the source of the reducing equivalent required or
how proton transfer from the hydroxo group induces breaking of the peroxo O-O
bond in this system have yet to be elucidated.

solution and solid-state spectroscopic data. The conclusion that both 74 and 75
co-exist in solution has been questioned, however, although separate more detailed

identiﬁcation of an intriguing set of diiron(III,IV) and diiron(IV,IV) complexes and
elucidation of pathways by which they may be interconverted [187]. These results
have provided key precedence for postulated high valent diiron enzyme interme-
diates and insights into possible ways they may react. The high valent compounds
are accessed through the reaction of diiron(III,III) species with H2O2, originally
proposed to involve conversion of hydroxo-aqua species A’ to the hydroperoxo

which then generated C’ [249]. Complex C’ rapidly undergoes O-O bond scission
to yield diiron(IV,IV) complex D’, which on the basis of Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy
and DFT calculations was shown to contain inequivalent low-spin S ¼ 1 Fe(IV)
sites coupled ferromagnetically to yield an overall S ¼ 2 state [250]. Complex D’
yields bis(μ-oxo)diiron species E’ or F’ upon reaction with hydrogen atom donors
or strong acids, respectively, and E’ and F’ may be interconverted electrochemi-
cally. These two “diamond core” species serve as important structural models for
enzyme intermediates X and Q, but their rates of reactions with weak C-H bonds
(cf., dihydroanthracene, DHA) are relatively slow, which for F’ raises a key
question about its viability as the active oxidant of methane by sMMO.
Interestingly, either through 1-electron reduction of D’ or treatment of E’ with
hydroxide, a high spin diiron(III,IV) species G’ forms that exhibits greatly enhanced
reactivity with dihydroanthracene (106-fold increase in rate relative to low-spin

relative E’) [251]. Finally, deprotonation of D’ has been shown to yield a rare
example of a diiron(IV,IV) complex (H’) with two terminal high-spin Fe(IV)¼O
units [247]. Spectroscopy and theory data were interpreted to indicate that H’ exists
in two forms in frozen solution, differing with respect to the spatial relationships of
the Fe(IV)¼O units and the presence or absence of a ‘bridging’ water molecule.
Intriguing similarities between Mo¨ssbauer parameters for H’a and compound Q in
sMMO were noted, as was the need for synthetic diiron(IV,IV) complexes that
feature O-donor supporting ligands more akin to those found in the enzyme.

Dioxygen Activation by Copper Complexes
Many enzymes that activate dioxygen contain copper ions in their active sites,
which feature a variety of nuclearities, structures, and functional attributes (Table 1,
entries 4,6,12,13,15,16) [252–260]. Efforts to understand the dioxygen activation
pathways and the chemistry of reactive intermediates for these enzymes have
included extensive studies of the reactions of O2 with Cu(I) complexes with a
variety of supporting ligands. Such studies are often performed at low temperature
(<50 C) in organic solvents in order to best enable identiﬁcation of highly
reactive species relevant to postulated catalytic intermediates. Using this approach,
and complementary ones such as the reactions of ROOH with Cu(II) precursors,
complexes with the core structures shown in Figure 37 have been characterized in
depth and key aspects of their reactivity explored. These studies have provided
important knowledge relevant to possible enzyme mechanisms and pathways of
Cu-promoted catalytic oxidations.
Much of the work on these complexes is presented in comprehensive reviews
that summarize work completed prior to approximately 2005 [261–265]. In the
following sections, we focus on more recent research results reported since that
date, organized by the nuclearity of the copper active site targeted. Some aspects are
described in a recent review [266].

Mononuclear Models of Monocopper Active Sites
in Enzymes
Mechanistic hypotheses for dioxygen activation by monocopper enzyme active sites
typically invoke binding of O2 to a Cu(I) center to yield a 1:1 adduct (Figure 38) [253,
267–270]. Various fates for such an adduct have been proposed, including
(a) reduction by one electron to yield a Cu(I)-O
2 species [271], or (b) reaction with
substrate via HAT to yield a Cu(II)-OOH unit [268, 272, 273]. The latter might also
be formed by protonation of the Cu(I)-O
2 species [274]. The Cu(II)-OOH interme-
diate may react with substrate via HAT or be reduced and protonated with loss of
H2O, both of which would yield a [CuO]+ moiety that theoretical calculations suggest
is best formulated as an S ¼ 1 Cu(II)-O• [275, 276]. This unit may itself be respon-
sible for attacking the C-H bond of the substrate via HAT [277], or might be trapped
by a substrate-derived radical to yield an alcoholate product (i.e., “rebound”).
The only species that have been identiﬁed in the enzymes are a peroxide bound
to Cu in an amine oxidase [278], and a peroxide complex [274] and a weakly bound

The [CuO]+ unit has been identiﬁed in the gas phase and shown to oxidize CH4
[276, 280], but has not been identiﬁed in biology or in a synthetic complex.
Importantly, a general lack of understanding of the structures, spectroscopic prop-
erties, and reactivity of the various aforementioned monocopper-oxygen species
provides the impetus for synthetic modeling studies.

4.1.1
1:1 Cu/O2 Adducts
The most fully characterized examples of 1:1 Cu/O2 complexes are shown in
Figure 39. Complexes 77–80 have been structurally deﬁned by X-ray crystallography,
and their geometries and electronic structures fully investigated [281–283]. In brief,
while complexes 77–79 feature side-on binding of the On 
2
fragment, they differ in
their bonding description. DFT calculations and spectroscopy results indicate that
while 77–79 are singlets (S ¼ 0 ground state), 77 is best described as a Cu(II)-
superoxide while 78 and 79 are Cu(III)-peroxides. Key data include Cu K- and
L-edges consistent with the indicated copper oxidation state assignments [282] and
ν(O-O) values indicative of superoxide (1112 cm1 for 77a) or peroxide (968cm1 for
78a) character, respectively [281]. Complex 80 exhibits end-on coordination with
structural and rR parameters indicative of a Cu(II)-superoxide (O-O ¼ 1.280(3) Å,
ν(O-O) ¼ 1120 cm1) [283, 284], but unlike 77–79, it has an S ¼ 1 ground state, as
shown by variable temperature, variable ﬁeld magnetic circular dichroism (VTVH-
MCD) spectroscopy and DFT studies [283]. While not yet characterized by X-ray
crystallography, adducts 81–85 have been studied by spectroscopy and theory, which
also support end-on Cu(II)-superoxo formulations [285–291]. Like 80, all are best
described as having triplet ground states, with an initial report of 81 being a singlet
[285] having been subsequently refuted through VTVH-MCD and NMR spectroscopy
[291]. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the superoxide ligand and the amide
NH of the ligand side-arm is a unique attribute of 84 [289], with interaction with either
the α or β oxygen of the superoxide being indicated by DFT calculations. It is worth
mentioning that an analog of 84 featuring two pivalamido groups was identiﬁed [292],
and that an earlier report of an X-ray structure of an analog with three such substituents
[293] was subsequently found to be in error [294].
Reactivity studies of end-on adducts 80–85 have provided fundamental insights
into ligand effects on 1:1 Cu/O2 adduct properties and have shed light on the question
of whether the initially formed Cu(II)-O
2 species proposed for the monocopper
enzymes is capable of attacking the C-H bonds of substrates. In support of this
capability, complex 82 (R ¼ phenethyl group) decays to yield 86 (Figure 40) via a
pathway shown by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations to proceed by rate-
limiting intramolecular hydrogen atom abstraction by the coordinated superoxide
from the benzylic C-H bond of the ligand phenethyl arm [286, 287].
A similar oxidation product with a hydroxylated ligand substituent forms upon
reaction of complex 80 (Figure 39) with phenols [295]. In this case, it is postulated that
H-atom abstraction from the phenol by the Cu(II)-O
2 unit yields a Cu(II)-OOH
species, which then attacks the ligand C-H bond (see below) [295, 296]. Complex
83 (Figure 39) also abstracts H-atoms from phenols [288]. Interestingly, while 84
(Figure 41) is unreactive with weak C-H bonds of substrates like DHA or xanthene, it
oxidizes the NADH analog 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, Figure 41)
[289]. It was suggested onthe basis of kinetic studies that this reaction proceeds not via
hydride transfer, but by rate-limiting hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate by the
Cu(II)-O
2 moiety.
The protonation/reduction of 80 and 84 (Figure 39) also has been studied
[297, 298]. In the reaction of 80 to yield H2O2 with CF3CO2H, initial formation

of a hydrogen-bonded Cu(II)-O
2 HO2CCF3 adduct was proposed on the basis of
spectroscopy and theory results [297]. Subsequent reduction by alkyl-substituted
ferrocenes yields H2O2 and a Cu(II) product. The 4-electron reduction of O2 by Fc*
was catalyzed by 84, and the reaction was shown to proceed faster than with the
analog lacking the pivalamido substituent [298]. Mechanistic experiments led to
the proposed mechanism shown in Figure 42.

In contrast to the generally electrophilic reactivity of 80–84, complex 85
(Figure 39) acts as a base and was surmised to have nucleophilic character,
presumably because of the overall negative charge of the complex and the strong
electron donating properties of the pyridine(dicarboxamide) supporting ligand
[290]. Thus, 85 is unreactive with alkyl-substituted phenols, appears to be proton-
ated by p-nitrophenol, does not oxidize PPh3, and may be trapped by [(TMPA)-
Cu(I)]OTf to yield a trans-η1:η1-peroxo-dicopper(II,II) complex [290].
4.1.2
CuOOR Complexes
In addition to being proposed as a product of reactions of 1:1 Cu/O2 adducts
with substrates, monocopper-hydroperoxo species are themselves considered to be
viable oxidants in enzymes. Building upon previous work focused primarily on the
characterization of monocopper-hydroperoxo and -alkylperoxo complexes [299–304],
more recent research has emphasized reactivity studies. For example, the complexes
87a, b (Figure 43) decompose to yield mixtures of products resulting from oxidation of
substituentsR(e.g.,N-alkylation,formationof aldehydesor ketones)[299,305]. Mech-
anistic studies suggest that these oxidations involve intramolecular HAT from the
position α to the N-atom of the ligand, either directly by the Cu(II)-OOH unit or by a
[CuO]+ moiety formed ﬁrst via O-O bond homolysis. In indirect support of the latter,
similar oxidized products formed in reactions of PhIO with Cu(I) complexes of the
supporting ligand in 87a, with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry evidence
supporting the involvement of [CuO]+ or adduct [CuOIPh]+ cores [299].
In related chemistry, hydroxylation at the ortho position of the pendant aryl ring
in 87c (Figure 43) occurred upon warming [306]. The involvement of bis(oxo)
dicopper species in this reaction was ruled out by evaluation of the reactivity of
such a species generated independently. The oxidative reactivity of complexes
87a–c stands in contrast to the Cu(II)-OOH complex supported by N4Py, which
while competent to oxidize PEt3, does not attack substrates such as thioanisole or

cyclohexadiene [307]. Evaluation by theory indicated that O-O bond homolysis in
this system is energetically unfavorable.
Homolytic scission of the O-O bond in a Cu(II)-OOR species (R ¼ alkyl or
aryl group) to yield a [CuO]+ intermediate has been invoked in several instances.
For example, the Cu(II)-cumylperoxo complex 88 decayed to yield a bis(hydroxo)
dicopper complex 89 and acetophenone, implicating an O-O bond homolysis
pathway (Figure 44) [308]. Further evidence in favor of this proposal came from
observation of hydrogen atom transfer reactivity in the presence of external sub-
strates and the formation of 90 upon addition of the radical trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-
pyrroline N-oxide. In later work, however, kinetic studies and DFT calculations
supported a pathway for reactions of 88 and an analog supported by tris
[2-(2-pyridyl)methyl]amine that involved concerted HAT and O-O bond homoly-
sis, rather than via prior formation of a discrete [CuO]+ intermediate [309].
In another example, a [CuO]+ species was evaluated as a possible intermediate in
the ligand hydroxylation outlined in Figure 45 [310]. Mimicking the O2 reactivity
of Fe(II)-α-ketocarboxylate units in proteins and model complexes (Section 3),
Cu(I)-α-ketocarboxylates 91 reacted with O2 to yield products derived from ortho

hydroxylation of the aryl ring of the supporting ligand. DFT calculations [310, 311]
support a mechanism involving initial decarboxylation to yield a “peracid” inter-
mediate, which can attack the aromatic ring directly or through initial conversion to
a reactive [CuO]+ species (Figure 45).
Finally, monocopper-hydroperoxo species are also implicated in catalytic reduc-
tions of dioxygen, as noted above in Figure 42 for a 4-electron process that generates
H2O [295]. Another example is in the 2-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2 by
ferrocene or Fc* catalyzed by a copper complex of tris[2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl]amine in
the presence of HClO4 [312]. A detailed mechanistic study of this system revealed
pre-equilibrium binding of O2 to a Cu(I) complex prior to formation of a [CuOOH]+
intermediate that is not reduced, but is instead protonated to yield H2O2.
4.1.3
Targeting [CuO]+ and Related Monocopper Species
As noted above, [CuO]+ species have been invoked as intermediates in reactions of
[CuOOR]+ cores. They have also been proposed to be generated as transient
intermediates from reactions of PhIO with various copper complexes [295, 299,
313, 314], as well as to be the active species responsible for aromatic arene
hydroxylations performed by Cu/Me3NO systems [315–319]. A mechanism for
the latter was proposed on the basis of theory that involves homolysis of the
O-N bond in Cu(II)-ONMe3 complexes to yield the [CuO]+ core and Me3N+•
[320, 321]. Here we describe some other recent attempts to prepare complexes
comprising the [CuO]+ unit and a protonated variant.
Reasoning that O-N bond heterolysis in Cu(I)-ONR3 complexes might
yield [CuO]+ species, reactions of pyridine- and trialkylamine-N-oxides with illus-
trative Cu(I) complexes 92–94 supported by various bidentate N-donor ligands were
explored (Figure 46) [322]. For some cases, stable adducts that were not susceptible
to O-N bond scission formed (e.g., 95 or 96). An exception was the generation of bis
(hydroxo)dicopper(II) (97) or bis(oxo)dicopper(III) complexes (98) in the reaction of
94 with Me3NO at room temperature or 80 C, respectively. It is unclear whether
these products form via O-N heterolysis followed by [CuO]+ dimerization, or by
dimerization of an initially formed Cu(I)-ONMe3 adduct followed by loss of Me3N.
In a different approach, monocopper-hydroxide complexes 99 (R ¼ iPr or Me)
were shown to undergo 1-electron oxidation at low potential (for R ¼ iPr, 0.076 V
versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) in acetone) to yield highly colored reactive
intermediates (Figure 47) [323, 324]. These intermediates were identiﬁed as
Cu(III)-hydroxide species 100 on the basis of DFT calculations and X-ray absorp-
tion spectroscopy for the system with R ¼ iPr [323].
A signiﬁcant shift in Cu K-edge features in the X-ray absorption spectrum to
higher energy compared to its copper(II)-hydroxide precursor were diagnostic for
assignment of a Cu(III) oxidation state in 100 (R ¼ iPr), which may be viewed as
comprising a protonated version of the [CuO]+ core. In order to draw comparisons
to other metal-oxo/hydroxo complexes, the reactivity of 100 with DHA was
studied. Kinetics studies revealed clean conversion to anthracene and a Cu(II)-
aqua complex that proceeded with a second-order rate law, a large KIE, and high

(R ¼ iPr) with DHA and those of other copper, iron, and manganese oxo/hydroxo
complexes revealed the reaction rate of 100 to be higher than most, and exceeded
only by a particularly reactive diiron-oxo complex. Evaluation of the underlying
reasons for this high reactivity are ongoing.
4.2
Dicopper Models of Dicopper Active Sites in Enzymes
Two copper ions in close proximity (within 5 Å) act to bind and/or activate dioxygen
in the O2 carrier protein hemocyanin and the enzymes tyrosinase and catechol
oxidase (Table I, entries 4, 6, and 13). The oxygenated forms of these systems have
been characterized by spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography [325–329], and have
been formulated conclusively as (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper(II) cores (Figure 48). As
discussed below, a key question that has inspired much synthetic modeling research
concerns whether this stable, identiﬁable core or an intermediate derived therefrom is
responsible for attacking substrate in tyrosinase or catechol oxidase.
Dicopper-oxygen species have also been suggested as oxidizing intermediates in
particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) [330], although the involvement of
tricopper species has also been argued [331]. While some spectroscopic results
point to the formation of a (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper(II) moiety in pMMO [332],
other species such as those shown in Figure 49 have been postulated on the basis of
theory [260, 333, 334] or merely speculated [335] to be more reactive oxidants that
are more likely to be capable of attacking the strong C-H bond of substrate methane.
In view of their novel structures and proposed reactivity, these species are prime
targets for synthetic modeling studies. Another noteworthy target is the (μ-oxo)-
dicopper(II) unit, which has been proposed recently on the basis of spectroscopy
and theory to be the active oxidant in Cu-doped zeolite catalysts that perform the
same reaction as pMMO [336, 337].

Transition Metal Complexes and the Activation of Dioxygen

Many studies of synthetic dicopper-oxygen intermediates have aimed to address
the aforementioned issues (as well as others), and these have been summarized in
extensive reviews, to which readers interested in work appearing prior to early 2012
are pointed [261–266, 338–341]. Most recently, Rolff et al. [340] describe work
showing (a) that both the (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)- and bis(μ-oxo)dicopper cores are capable
of hydroxylating phenolates like in tyrosinase in both stoichiometric and catalytic
reactions, (b) that reactions of phenols with these cores often yield radical coupling
products, pointing to the importance of proton ‘management’ by the enzyme, and
(c) how the orbital interactions involved in arene hydroxylation reactions of both
cores underly their reactivity. Halvagar et al. [266] describe work with focus on
revealing the factors that favor the formation of either or both of these cores in
oxygenation reactions, while Fukuzumi and Karlin [341] summarize efforts to reveal
the kinetics and thermodynamics of the formation of dicopper-oxygen species and
their mechanisms of reduction by hydride and electron-transfer reagents. Herein,
rather than duplicating the discussions presented in these (and earlier) review articles,
we focus on selected pertinent recent work published in 2012 and 2013.
4.2.1
Peroxo- and Bis(μ-oxo)dicopper Complexes
New examples of peroxo- and bis(μ-oxo)dicopper complexes were recently
described using the supporting ligands shown in Figure 50. Low temperature
oxygenation of the Cu(I) complex of 101 yielded a bis(μ-oxo)dicopper species,
identiﬁed as such on the basis of diagnostic UV-vis and rR spectroscopic features
[342]. Self-assembly of the (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper core was observed upon
oxygenation of the Cu(I) complex supported by three imidazole ligands 102 in
2-methyltetrahydrofuran at 125 C, demonstrating that the oxytyrosinase core
may be prepared bereft of the protein matrix using simple biomimics of histidine
residues [343]. Functional modeling of tyrosinase was also achieved with this
system, as revealed through mechanistic studies of hydroxylations of added
phenolates. The (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper core was also observed upon low
temperature oxygenation of the Cu(I) complex of 103 (R ¼ iPr) [344], in contrast
to the previous reports of bis(μ-oxo)dicopper complex formation for the cases of
R ¼ Et, Bn, iBu [345]. These results are consistent with previous ﬁndings that
increased steric bulk of supporting ligands disfavors formation of the more compact
bis(μ-oxo)dicopper core [261, 262, 266]. A (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper complex was
also formed upon oxygenation of the Cu(I) complex of 104 (Figure 50) and this

species was sufﬁciently stable to be used to catalytically oxidize phenols to
quinones in the presence of added base [346].
The “asymmetric” ligand 105 (Figure 50) favors formation of a (μ-η1:η1-peroxo)-
dicopper core, which was shown to be competent to hydroxylate added phenolates
via a pathway that involves detectable phenolate-bound intermediates [347]. These
electrophilic hydroxylations are unusual for such end-on peroxo cores, which
typically act as nucleophiles instead [339]. In addition, (μ-η1:η1-peroxo)dicopper
cores were implicated in oxygenation reactions of Cu(I) complexes of bispidine
ligands 106 [348] and 107 [349], and the pathway for catecholase activity of such
oxygenated complexes was evaluated by theory [349].
Two recent contributions exclusively use theoretical approaches to tackle issues
associated with the properties of (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)- and bis(μ-oxo)dicopper complexes.

Transition Metal Complexes and the Activation of Dioxygen

Following up on previous work that underlined the difﬁculties associated with using
theory to understand the electronic structural properties and relative stabilities of these
cores [350, 351], a further evaluation of the reliability of various functionals was
reported [352]. The results conﬁrmed that no single functional is optimal for describing
systems with different supporting ligands. Another theoretical study focused on eval-
uating the mechanism for phenolate hydroxylation by the (μ-η2:η2-peroxo)dicopper
complex supported by N,N’-di-tert-butylethylenediamine [353]. In the original work
on this system [354, 355], evidence had been provided to support O-O bond scission to
yield a bis(μ-oxo)dicopper intermediate with bound phenolate which subsequently
underwent electrophilic attack, thus providing precedent for the notion that the
bis(μ-oxo)dicopper core might be the active oxidant in tyrosinase. In the more recent
theoretical study, O-O bond scission was found to precede phenolate coordination, and
details of the hydroxylation reaction were described [353].
Intramolecular hydroxylation of bridging arene groups in dinucleating ligands is a
well-known process in copper chemistry [261–264], but recent work has provided
some new insights into the nature of the species that might be responsible for this type
of reaction. In one study, bis(μ-oxo)dicopper complex 108 (Figure 51) was identiﬁed
as an intermediate and shown to both attack the bridging m-xylyl group and to react
with exogenous phenols (predominantly via a radical type pathway) [356]. In contrast,
DFT calculations calibrated by experimental Cu L-edge spectroscopy data that shed
light on metal-ligand covalency showed that the peroxo unit in complex 109 attacks
the m-xylyl group without the intermediacy of a bis(μ-oxo)dicopper complex [357].
4.2.2
(μ-Oxo)dicopper Complexes
The recent postulate of a (μ-oxo)dicopper(II) core as the active oxidant in
heterogeneous Cu-doped zeolite catalysts that convert methane to methanol has
stimulated consideration of this unit as an intermediate in pMMO [260].
As described in a recent review [358], synthetic complexes with this core are
relatively rare, in part because of their tendency to react readily with water to
yield bis(μ-hydroxo)dicopper(II) complexes [359–362]. In a recent resurgence of
interest in these species, ligands 110 and 111 (Figure 52) have been used to prepare

and characterize species proposed to contain (μ-oxo)dicopper(II) cores [363, 364].
In both cases, these species formed upon treatment of dicopper(I) complexes with
O2 or PhIO. For the system comprising 110, the (μ-oxo)dicopper(II) product was
identiﬁed on the basis of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and resonance Raman
spectroscopy, but more complete characterization was hindered by its thermal
instability [363]. Ligand 111 led to a more stable complex 112, which was more
fully characterized, including by EXAFS (Cu-Cu ¼ 2.91 Å), NMR spectroscopy,
high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and DFT calculations
[364]. In initial reactivity studies, 112 induced coupling of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol,
a process reminiscent of the H-atom abstraction reactivity known for bis(μ-oxo)-
dicopper(III) complexes [262].

The (μ-oxo)dicopper(II) unit has been characterized by X-ray crystallography in
only one instance, to our knowledge, within the tricopper cluster 113 (Figure 52)
[365]. Touted as a model of the oxidized form of pMMO, reduction of this cluster
by α-diketones followed by oxygenation results in the formation of the
corresponding carboxylic acid. A mechanistic rationale for this process involving
O2 activation by a tricopper(I) species was invoked.
4.3
Tricopper Models of Multicopper Active Sites in Enzymes
Interest in tricopper-oxygen species is inspired by (a) the involvement of tricopper
active sites in the multicopper oxidases [252, 254], ubiquitous enzymes that play a
central role in oxidative metabolism and other key biological processes, and (b) the
proposal that the active site of pMMO is a tricopper center [331]. A variety of
multicopper catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidations have been described [366, 367],
but while stable Cu(I) or Cu(II) precursors or ‘resting states’ are often identiﬁed, the
nature of the multicopper-oxygen intermediates responsible for attacking the C-H
bonds are usually only speculated on the basis of indirect and/or ambiguous
spectroscopic or theoretical evidence [368–370]. In studies of dioxygen activation
by more than two Cu(I) sites that target possible intermediates, tricopper species
often comprise the bis(μ-oxo)tricopper(II,II,III) core (114, Figure 53). Initially
prepared and fully characterized upon low temperature oxygenation of Cu(I)
complexes of ligands 115 [371–373], such cores have since been reported using
several other N-donors (115–118) [374–376]. Complex 119 was prepared by low
temperature oxygenation of a tricopper(I) complex of ligand 118. Interestingly,
dipicolylamine-copper(I) complexes in
which the
dipicolyl ligand
is not
‘pre-organized’ like in 118 do not afford [Cu3(μ-O)2]3+ cores, showing that the
preassembly of the Cu(I) centers by the ligand scaffold of 118 is key to the
formation of this core in this case.
Interesting reactivity differences have been identiﬁed for the [Cu3(μ-O)2]3+ core
supported by different N-donor ligands. The complexes of 115 and 116 react
with 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol to yield the radical coupling product 3,3’,5,5’-tetra-
tert-butyl-2,2’-biphenol, consistent with electrophilic character and H-atom
abstraction reactivity similar to related bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(III) complexes [262].
In contrast, the complex supported by 117 was unreactive with phenols or DHA, but
oxidized PPh3 to O¼PPh3 and was quenched by CO2 [375]. Apparently, the charge
and strong electron donating properties of 117 perturb the core so as to induce
‘nucleophilic’ reactivity similar to that identiﬁed for (trans-1,2-peroxo)dicopper
complexes [264].

Concluding Remarks
Recent advances in the study of synthetic Fe and Cu complexes has led to greater
understanding of the detailed chemistry involved in the binding and activation of O2
by Fe and Cu sites in biological and other catalysts. Adherence to the overarching
mechanistic paradigm shown in Figure 1 appears general, notwithstanding fasci-
nating differences in detail and the complicating involvement of redox noninnocent
supporting ligands and/or cofactors.
Conclusive identiﬁcation of many key intermediates has been achieved, opening
the door to reactivity studies that are beginning to provide mechanistic insights
useful for understanding metalloprotein function and for developing new and useful
catalysts. Yet many putative intermediates suggested to be involved in some of the
most challenging oxidation reactions, such as the conversion of methane to meth-
anol, have not been prepared and characterized.
Many questions remain about how O-O bond breaking occurs and is controlled
(cf., by secondary-sphere hydrogen bonding and other environmental inﬂuences),

and about the structures and properties of high valent Fe(IV), Fe(V), and Cu(III)
species thought to be the active oxidants in oxidation reactions. These and other
questions continue to inspire efforts to isolate, characterize, and evaluate the
reactivity of synthetic complexes that bind O2 and/or incorporate O2-derived
moieties, high valent metal centers, and redox active ligands. Perhaps most evident
from the survey of the ﬁeld is the fact that creative ligand design and application of
advanced spectroscopic, isolation, and mechanistic tools is key to enabling the
discovery of new compounds and mechanistic ideas.

Abstract Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) catalyze the conversion of methane
to methanol as the ﬁrst committed step in the assimilation of this hydrocarbon
into biomass and energy by methanotrophs, thus playing a signiﬁcant role in the
biogeochemistry of this potent greenhouse gas. Two distinct enzymes, a copper-
dependent membrane protein, particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), and
an iron-dependent cytosolic protein, soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO),
carry out this transformation using large protein scaffolds that help to facilitate the
timely transport of hydrocarbon, O2, proton, and electron substrates to buried
dimetallic active sites. For both enzymes, reaction of the reduced metal centers
with O2 leads to intermediates that activate the relatively inert C–H bonds of
hydrocarbons to yield oxidized products. Among synthetic and biological catalysts,
MMOs are unique because they are the only ones known to hydroxylate methane at
ambient temperatures. As a need for new industrial catalysts and green chemical
transformations increases, understanding how the different MMO metal centers
efﬁciently accomplish this challenging chemistry has become the focus of intense
study. This chapter examines current understanding of the sMMO and pMMO
protein structures, their methods for substrate channeling, and mechanisms for the
dimetallic activation of O2 and C–H bonds.

Introduction
Methanogens living in anaerobic environments produce greater than 200–250 million
metric tons of methane per year as a byproduct of catabolizing biomass [1].
Taking advantage of this unique waste product, methanotrophs evolved to survive
at the interface between anaerobic and aerobic worlds where they require both
methane and O2 for the metabolic assimilation into macromolecules and stored
energy [2]. By using methane as a primary carbon and energy source, methanotrophs
limit the escape of this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and thereby lessen
its global environmental impact [2, 3]. Responsible for catalyzing the conversion of
methane to methanol and initiating biomass assimilation in methanotrophs are
methane monooxygenases (MMOs), of which two distinct forms exist. The most
prevalent, and least understood, form is the copper-utilizing membrane-bound or
particulate MMO (pMMO), which can account for up to 20 % of the total protein in
methanotrophs [4–7]. The iron-containing cytosolic or soluble MMO (sMMO), found
only in some methanotrophic species, is better characterized [8–11]. Both enzymes
have received signiﬁcant attention because they routinely carry out one of the most
difﬁcult chemistries in nature, the breaking of a relatively inert and high energy CH
bond (104 kcal/mol) at ambient temperatures. Other iron, copper, and cytochrome
P450 monooxygenases that readily hydroxylate larger, more reactive hydrocarbons
cannot oxidize methane, making MMOs unique catalysts.
Isolated from a variety of different environments, most acidophilic, alkaliphilic,
psychrophilic, thermophilic, and mesophilic methanotrophs except for the
Methyocella genus contain genes for pMMO, suggesting that it is the predominate
MMO in the environment [2, 12]. Some species, which include extensively studied
Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, differen-
tially express both pMMO and sMMO based on copper availability [13–16].
High environmental copper suppresses sMMO translation in these organisms and
induces the expression of pMMO as well as the synthesis of intracytoplasmic
membranes into which pMMO is incorporated. Conversely, low copper concen-
trations lead to sMMO expression and synthesis of methanobactins, copper
scavenging compounds or chalkophores, with properties and functions like those
of the widely studied siderophores [17–20].
Structurally and mechanistically, there are few similarities between pMMO and
sMMO. However, both of these enzymes share one important task, the efﬁcient
generation of oxidized hydrocarbon products by coordinating the reactivity of four

substrates (hydrocarbon, oxygen, electrons, and protons) at a highly reactive
dimetallic center. Methane is the primary MMO substrate that can most readily
be funneled into lower metabolic pathways for the purposes of carbon assimilation
and energy production via the serine and ribulose monophosphate pathways
(Figure 1) [2].
pMMO and sMMO, however, are capable of regio- and stereospeciﬁcally
hydroxylating a wide variety of hydrocarbon substrates. Whereas sMMO can act
on linear and branched alkanes and alkenes of up to eight carbons in length, in
addition to aromatic, heterocyclic, and halogenated compounds [21–26], pMMO is
more selective toward alternative substrates with preferences for alkanes and
alkenes of up to ﬁve and four carbons, respectively [3, 27–29]. Because they are
such powerful catalysts, the iron and copper centers of sMMO and pMMO,
respectively, have been investigated intensely for their potential wide-ranging
applications to synthesis and environmental remediation [3, 22]. This chapter
focuses on the current knowledge of the pMMO and sMMO systems and how
they carry out their respective enzymatic functions.
2
Particulate Methane Monooxygenase
pMMO comprises three polypeptide chains, a 45-kDa α-subunit (pmoB), a 26-kDa
β-subunit (pmoA), and a 23-kDa γ-subunit (pmoC), that assemble into a
homotrimer with an (αβγ)3 conﬁguration (Figure 2 and Figure 3 below) [30].
Because pMMO is vital to the survival of most methanotrophs, several species
contain duplicate copies of the pmoCAB genes [31]. The closely related pMMO
homolog, ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), is the only other known enzyme
that can oxidize methane, and its composition is similar to that of pMMO [32].
Over the years, different approaches by several laboratories toward the puriﬁcation
and biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of pMMO have generated
much debate and confusion in the literature about the metal content, metal type,
subunit stoichiometry, and active site location. For example, puriﬁcations of
pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b have generated
results suggesting that it contains 2, 2–3, 8–10, and 15–20 coppers per αβγ protomer
as well as signiﬁcant quantities of iron, ~0.75–2.5 ions/protomer [14, 33–39].

From
spectroscopic
investigations,
mononuclear,
dinuclear,
and
trinuclear
copper sites, as well as a diiron center, have all been proposed for the pMMO
active site [5, 12, 40]. The inherent complexities with working on a membrane
protein coupled with the difﬁculty of identifying the nature of the pMMO active site
explain why our understanding of pMMO has lagged behind that of sMMO.
Fortunately, signiﬁcant strides have been made recently that bring clarity to the
problem and a better understanding of pMMO. The following sections are not
intended to be an exhaustive treatment of the pMMO literature, but instead aim to
present the most reasonable and clear picture to date as to how this protein operates.
2.1
Architecture
The ﬁrst crystal structure of pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) was
solved to 2.8 Å resolution [30, 40]. The structure conﬁrmed that pMMO is an (αβγ)3
homotrimer in which each αβγ protomer contains a single copy of the pmoB, pmoA,
and pmoC subunits arranged as a 3-fold cylinder with a channel through the middle
of the barrel (Figure 2). The pmoC and pmoA subunits comprise the bulk of the
transmembrane region, which is ~45 Å in length. The N- and C-terminal cytosolic
domains of the pmoB subunit have a cupredoxin-like β-barrel fold and are linked by
two transmembrane helices. The global structure is highly consistent with earlier
Figure 2 (a) Global structure of pMMO (PDB entry 3RGB) depicting each of the three αβγ
protomers. (b) Top down view of the cytosolic pMMO pmoB cupredoxin-like domains depicting

The electrostatic surfaces of the pmoB cupredoxin domains are strongly
negative and may facilitate docking to methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) [42], the
second enzyme in the methane catabolic pathway.
2.2
Metal Centers
The initial M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO structure identiﬁed three metal binding
sites and a fourth hypothetical site derived from a clustering of potential metal
ligands. At each of the occupied sites, the type of bound metal was identiﬁed by
anomalous difference electron density maps [30]. The cytosolic domains of pmoB
harbor two of these sites. On the N-terminal domain, His33, His137, and His139
and the N-terminal amine of His33 coordinate a dinuclear copper site located close
to the membrane surface (Figure 3).

These residues are conserved across all known Proteobacterial methanotroph
pmoB sequences [5]. Verrucomicrobia, which represent a distinct phylum of
methanotrophs having pMMO-like sequences that are divergent from the
Proteobacterial ones, do not conserve any of the ligands contributing to this
site [5, 43]. It is unknown whether the Verrucomicrobia homologues oxidize
methane or carry out an alternative function in these organisms. pmoB residues
1–32 are an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the protein to cytoplasmic
membranes and they are cleaved off in vivo to facilitate assembly of the dinuclear
site. The CuCu distance was modeled at 2.5–2.6 Å based on X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) data for the isolated protein [34, 44]. Similar CuCu distances
were observed in M. trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO
[39, 45]. At this resolution, ﬁner details about the ligand geometry and identities of
the exogenous terminal and bridging ligands could not be determined. Subsequent
low resolution structures of pMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b (3.9 Å) and
Methylocystis sp. strain M (2.68 Å) suffer from a similar problem that make it
very difﬁcult to deﬁnitively build an accurate representation of this dimetallic site
[39, 45]. In the Methylocystis structure, two of the three centers are modeled with
only one copper, suggesting how labile the metal ion may be at this site.
At the interface between the N- and C-terminal cupredoxin domains of the pmoB
subunit of M. capsulatus (Bath), a mononuclear copper-binding site is coordinated
by His48 and His72 (Figure 3c) [30]. Among homologous Proteobacterial
and
Verrucomicrobia
pMMO
proteins
and
the
closely
related
ammonia
monooxygenases, sequence alignments indicate His48 is not conserved and is
replaced with either Asn, Gln, Thr, or Val [5]. M. trichosporium OB3b and
Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO substitute His48 for an asparagine and show
no copper binding at this position in their structures [39, 45].
A third metal binding site was identiﬁed in the transmembrane region of the
pmoA subunit facing the large inner channel of the pMMO trimer (Figure 3e). In
the M. capsulatus (Bath) and Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO structures, zinc,
required for crystallization, binds the enzyme and is coordinated to Asp156,
His160, and His173. The M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO structure, which did
not require zinc for crystallization, has copper bound at this position, but it should
be noted that this metal was added during puriﬁcation. Although the residues at this
site appear to be conserved across all species, there are lingering questions as to
whether this site is biologically signiﬁcant [5].
Lastly, in the initial pMMO structure from M. capsulatus (Bath), a fourth
putative site unoccupied by metal ions was identiﬁed at the interface between the
pmoA and pmoC subunits in the transmembrane region based on the localization of
several hydrophilic His, Met, Glu, and Asp residues [30]. This region of the protein
was hypothesized to house proposed trinuclear copper and diiron catalytic sites
[12, 46]. A higher resolution Methylosinus sp. strain M pMMO structure later
revealed that some of the transmembrane helixes in this region of the protein
were mistraced in the original M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO structure [39].
The resulting re-traced structure shows this fourth putative site to be non-existent.

2.3
Identifying the Active Site
2.3.1
Proposed Active Sites
Over the years, it has been a challenge to identify the location and metal content
of the enzyme active site. Protein puriﬁcations from various laboratories yielding
variable levels of copper atoms per protomer with and without 1–2 iron atoms
produced spectroscopic data from which several different active site models were
proposed [14, 33–39]. Early electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic
investigations of M. capsulatus (Bath) membrane fractions and puriﬁed protein
containing 15–20 coppers per protomer yielded type II copper spectra with a
hyperﬁne splitting pattern and an isotropic signal at g ¼ 2.06 that were interpreted
to suggest the existence of catalytic and electron transfer trinuclear copper centers
with similar conﬁgurations to those of multicopper oxidases like laccase, ascorbate
oxidase, and ceruloplasmin [47–50]. A similar type II Cu(II) EPR signal was
observed in preparations from M. trichosporium Ob3b [51, 52].
Preparations of pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) and membrane fractions of
Methylomicrobium albus BG8 from different laboratories, however, exhibited
spectra more typical of type II Cu(II), which could be interpreted as a mononuclear
copper site having a square planar composition and a coordination sphere com-
prising mostly histidines [33, 38, 53–55]. These ﬁndings, in addition to the
puriﬁcation and spectroscopic characterization of active pMMO with 2–3 copper
atoms per protomer, called into question the plausibility of a trinuclear copper site
[34, 44]. The ﬁrst crystal structures of pMMO suggested that mononuclear and
dinuclear copper centers should be considered carefully as the locus of catalytic
activity, given their similarity to type II and type III copper centers in amino
acid/peptide monooxygenases and catechol oxidase, respectively [40, 49].
Lastly, several laboratories, after accounting for a common cytochrome contam-
ination, proposed pMMO to be an Fe–Cu enzyme, because pMMO preparations
having higher iron content seemed to display better activity [12, 14, 38, 51, 56, 57].
Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopic study of puriﬁed pMMO fractions from M. capsulatus
(Bath) containing signiﬁcant levels of non-heme iron suggested the presence of a
carboxylate-bridged diiron center similar to that in sMMO [57]. The three con-
served residues that constituted the mononuclear zinc/copper site were proposed
as the location for this iron center, despite the paucity of potential amino acid
ligands, conserved or otherwise, needed to support a dinuclear site at this position.
The foregoing discrepancies between competing laboratories may have their
origin in one or more of the following: differences in protein preparation leading to
the loss of labile copper and/or iron; possible co-puriﬁcation of pMMO with
methanobactin, which would increase the amount of copper in the samples;
contamination by the sMMO hydroxylase component (MMOH), which would
add diiron centers; or the presence of bacteriohemerythrin, a hemerythrin-like
protein expressed at high copper levels that is proposed to deliver O2 to pMMO,
which would also elevate iron levels [12, 27, 35, 46, 58].

2.3.2
Evidence for a Dicopper Active Site
Several lines of evidence indicate the dicopper site to be the locus of
methane oxidation in pMMO. Metal reconstitution studies of apo-pMMO from
M. capsulatus (Bath) revealed that the addition of 2–3 copper ions per protomer
returned 90 % of the original activity whereas the addition of iron had no effect on
turnover [39, 59]. Adding more than 2–3 equivalents of copper per apo-pMMO
protomer inhibited the enzyme [60], possibly by hydrogen peroxide formation
because the addition of catalase minimized this effect [61].
Studies of the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB cupredoxin domains provide the most
signiﬁcant line of evidence pointing toward the dicopper site as the one responsible
for methane hydroxylation [60]. A recombinant soluble construct, termed spmoB,
was created by replacing the two transmembrane helices anchoring the pmoB
subunit to the membrane with a soluble synthetic linker that fused the two
pmoB cytosolic domains (spmoBD1 residues 33–172 and spmoBD2 residues
265–414) (Figure 3a). After refolding the protein from inclusion bodies and
reconstituting, spmoB bound ~3 copper ions and oxidized methane with an activity
of 203.1  20.2 nmol min1μmol1 compared to that of the full length protein,
2290  60 nmol min1 μmol1. This result indicated that the cytosolic domains,
and not the transmembrane region, are responsible for the hydroxylation chemistry.
A His48Asn variant that removed the mononuclear copper site at the interface
between the cupredoxin domains afforded a construct that bound ~2 coppers and
displayed 10 % activity compared to that of the original spmoB. This decrease was
attributed to a misfolding of the two domains, which share over ~1400 Å2 of buried
surface area. Conversely, a His137, 139Ala spmoB double variant targeting
the dicopper site bound ~1 copper ion and all activity was abolished. XAS studies
detailing the coordination environment around the copper centers of spmoB
indicated three- to four-coordinate Cu(I) and an O/N rich environment with average
Cu–O/N distances of 1.95 Å and a Cu–Cu interaction at 2.53 Å. These values are
nearly identical to those obtained from ﬁts to XAS data of puriﬁed and copper-
reconstituted full-length pMMO.
The low activity of spmoB compared to the full length enzyme, while a concern,
can be attributed to several factors. Not all of the protein may have been refolded
properly, and delivery of electrons to the metal center may not be as efﬁcient in the
absence of the transmembrane domains. The dicopper site in the spmoB construct is
highly solvent-exposed. It is conceivable that the transmembrane domains plus the
lipid membrane play a signiﬁcant role in coordinating reactivity of the reduced
metal center with gaseous substrates so as to prevent buffer components from
adventitiously quenching the reaction. In short, all signs point toward a dinuclear
copper site as the likely pMMO active site. Although the location of the active site
has become clariﬁed, a detailed picture of the resting dimetallic center structure
with the appropriate copper-coordinating protein- and solvent-derived ligands
and their geometries remain to be determined. The square-planer 3–4 coordinate
geometry indicated by EPR and XAS studies suggest that each copper at this
site requires an additional 1–2 ligands [34, 53, 60], which presumably are
solvent-derived oxo, hydroxo, and/or aqua species.

Methane Monooxygenase: Functionalizing Methane at Iron and Copper
213

Beyond the residues that coordinate directly to the dicopper center, strictly
conserved amino acids in the pmoB subunit in the second coordination sphere
that could participate in O2 and CH4 activation process are scarce. Acidic residues
at positions 339 and 35 in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO are intriguing candidates for
further investigation into pMMO metal center assembly and proton transfer events,
given their close proximity to the dicopper site (Figure 4a), but they are not
conserved in related methanotrophs.
The absence of any conserved residues beyond those that coordinate to the
metals stands in contrast to the situation for sMMO and related bacterial
multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs), where highly conserved residues in
the second and third coordination spheres are essential for assembly of the hydrox-
ylase diiron center, proton transfer (via conserved Thr213 and Asn214 residues), O2
and methane access to the diiron center, as well as electron transfer.
2.4
Substrate Access and Product Egress
from the Dicopper Site
2.4.1
Access to the Substrate-Binding Pocket
The pMMO dicopper site is located about 6 Å from the protein surface, almost
at the interface between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Surface calcu-
lations show cavities on both faces of the dicopper center providing access to
solvent through small openings in the protein surface (Figure 4b). Cavity 1 is
Figure 4 (a) Local environment surrounding the pMMO dicopper center. (b) Putative substrate-
binding cavities (1 and 2) adjacent to the pMMO dicopper center. The pmoB and pmoC subunits
are depicted as white and gray ribbons, respectively.

shallow (5–6 Å deep), lined with polar residues, and relatively solvent-exposed.
Cavity 2 lies between the ﬁrst pmoB cupredoxin domain and pmoC at the
transmembrane interface. This cavity is longer (~14 Å), narrower, and quite
hydrophobic. These features are conserved in three pMMO crystal structures,
but the variable dicopper center geometries observed at low resolution make it
difﬁcult to visualize the exact morphologies of these pockets. The narrow substrate
proﬁle of pMMO, comprising short-chain alkanes of up to ﬁve carbons in length,
and enantioselective formation of R-2-alcohols tends to support the latter sterically
restricted cavity as the substrate-binding pocket [62–64]. It is unclear whether the
wider more polar cavity has any function, although one could speculate that it
might support the binding of membrane associated quinones and help to facilitate
direct electron transfer from the reductant to the dicopper center.
2.4.2
Substrate and Product Channeling
The requirement of a 300 kDa protein for activating such small substrates suggests
that the large scaffold may play a signiﬁcant role in channeling and coordinating the
movement of molecules to and from the active site. Additional “holes” noted in
the exterior of the pMMO structure at the membrane interface may serve this
purpose by controlling hydrocarbon and O2 access to the dicopper center [41],
possibly by using a scheme similar to that observed in the sMMO and its homo-
logue, toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO), where a series of hydrophobic
cavities facilitate dioxygen movement through the protein [65]. Dioxygen delivery
may also be conferred by bacteriohemerythrins [66]. Like pMMO, expression of
this O2-binding protein is up-regulated at high copper-to-biomass ratios. For
M. capsulatus (Bath), enhanced hydroxylation activity occurs with the addition of
bacteriohemerythrin to pMMO-enriched membranes, suggesting this component to
be important for delivering dioxygen to the intracytoplasmic membranes.
A cryo-electron microscopy structure of pMMO detailing how MDH docks on
top of the pmoB cupredoxin domains suggests the two proteins participate in
substrate channeling, possibly by using the central cavity as a mode for product
egress [41, 42]. Some biochemical evidence for channeling may come from work
using the suicide substrate acetylene, which, when activated by the enzyme,
covalently attaches to nearby amino acids by a mechanism that has yet to be fully
resolved. Before the pMMO crystal structures were obtained, mass spectrometric
analysis of 14C-acetylene-labeled pMMO identiﬁed modiﬁed sites in the pmoA and
pmoB subunits and suggested early on that the active site did not reside in the pmoB
cupredoxin domain but instead in the other subunits [16, 38, 67]. Similar results
were obtained with AMO, in which His191 in the AmoA subunit (the analog
to Tyr186 in the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoA subunit) was distinctly labeled
[68–70]. This residue is ~14–19 Å removed from the pmoB dicopper center and
sits close to the central cavity of the pMMO trimer. The modiﬁcation of residues
distant from the dicopper site suggests the activated acetylene compound migrates
through the protein before it covalently attaches and that internal cavities may play
a speciﬁc role in coordinating substrate and product movement.

Electron Sources
The
source
of
electrons
for
the
pMMO
system
is
currently
unknown.
Membrane-bound quinols associated with the electron transport chain have long
been assumed to be the pMMO reductants [33, 34, 38, 51]. This assignment is
consistent with steady state experiments on isolated membranes or puriﬁed protein,
which have successfully employed duroquinol as the reductant. Other laboratories
have noted NADH-dependent activity [35], although it is likely that there
was co-puriﬁcation of pMMO with a type 2 NADH:quinone oxidoreductase
contaminant [14].
Recent co-puriﬁcation of pMMO with MDH led to a reconsideration of a
hypothesis in which electrons from the oxidation of methanol are recycled into
the oxidation of methane [42, 71]. It is possible that the reduced pyrroloquinoline
quinone (PQQH2) cofactor generated by oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde
in MDH donates its electrons back to pMMO as the last step in its catalytic cycle.
Such an event could obviate any need to shuttle NADH generated by downstream
reactions through additional redox proteins to supply pMMO with reductant and
facilitate faster growth. Further work is required to deﬁnitively establish the
electron source.
2.5
Mechanism
A major goal for researchers working on pMMO is to provide a detailed under-
standing of its mechanism, and especially how pMMO is unique compared to other
hydrocarbon-oxidizing dinuclear copper proteins like tyrosinase and catechol
oxidase. The problems associated with the puriﬁcation and stability of pMMO, as
well as the controversy surrounding the identiﬁcation of the active site, have slowed
progress, especially when compared to our understanding of sMMO.
Complicating matters further is the difﬁculty in studying membrane proteins like
pMMO with rapid kinetic and spectroscopic methodologies in order to observe key
intermediates in the O2 and C–H bond activation processes. Although information
is scarce, some signiﬁcant progress has been made recently toward this goal. Here
we examine current knowledge of the O2 and C–H bond activation steps in pMMO
as well as additional insight gained by related work from model compounds and
computational studies.
2.5.1
Spectroscopic Identiﬁcation of an Oxygen Intermediate
The ﬁrst, and currently only, observed spectroscopically detected intermediate in
pMMO was identiﬁed by addition of anoxic hydrogen peroxide to ascorbate-
reduced M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, which over 12 h produced a stable optical
216
Sazinsky and Lippard

feature at 345 nm with ε ¼ 10,000 cm1 M1 [72]. This same optical spectrum was
observed in spmoB samples, but here it appeared almost immediately after reacting
the reduced protein with either O2 or H2O2. It is not understood why pMMO reacts
differently than spmoB toward O2 and H2O2, but greater substrate accessibility to
the active site in spmoB was suggested to play a role. As expected, the spmoB
His48Asn variant behaved like the wild-type spmoB and the His137, His139 double
variant exhibited no reactivity toward dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide, again iden-
tifying the dicopper site as the essential catalytic center. The addition of methane to
this stable copper-oxygen complex in pMMO and spmoB results in a disappearance
of the spectral feature, demonstrating that this oxygen-derived intermediate is
catalytically competent and possibly the one responsible for C–H bond activation.
The optical spectroscopic properties of the pMMO oxygen-derived species have
been observed in type III copper systems like tyrosinase, hemocyanin, and
multicopper oxidases, and these are characteristic of either a μ-η2:η2-peroxo CuII
2
or a hydroxo-bridged CuII
2 intermediate (Table 1) [73–76].
The dinuclear metal centers in these related type III copper proteins are coordi-
nated by 5–6 histidines, have much longer Cu–Cu distances of 3.1–3.6 Å, and
appear more constrained by the surrounding protein scaffold. By contrast, the
bidendate coordination of one copper in pMMO by the N-terminal histidine may
offer greater ﬂexibility and allow the metal center to adopt novel geometries that
have yet to be identiﬁed. The exact structure of the pMMO intermediate remains
uncertain, however, and further structural and biochemical characterization of this
species is crucial to further our understanding of the enzyme chemistry. Unfortu-
nately, the application of resonance Raman spectroscopy is limited by the presence
of a persistent cytochrome contaminant in puriﬁcations of the native protein, and
high concentrations of refolded spmoB have been difﬁcult to achieve.
2.5.2
Computational Studies and Comparisons
to Copper Model Compounds
Computational studies examining the reactivity of O2 and CH4 with the different
copper sites in pMMO and the characterization of copper model complexes
have provided valuable insights into the pMMO mechanism [46, 77–79].

Methane Monooxygenase: Functionalizing Methane at Iron and Copper
217

In one particular set of calculations, a mixed-valent di-μ-oxo-CuIICuIII species was
found to be more reactive toward methane than either a mononuclear CuIII-oxo or a
di-μ-oxo Cu2
III intermediate [77, 78]. Such a reactive di-μ-oxo-CuIICuIII center
could be generated in the enzyme if an electron were injected into either a
μ-η2:η2-peroxo Cu2
II or a di-μ-oxo Cu2
III precursor, although the latter species has
yet to be identiﬁed in biological systems [4, 80] (Figure 5). This electron could
originate from a metal center, an exogenous reductant, or a protein residue.
Methane oxidation by the reactive di-μ-oxo-CuIICuIII center was calculated to
occur through a concerted, non-radical oxygen insertion mechanism (Figure 6).
A possibly signiﬁcant development in the pMMO ﬁeld was the identiﬁcation
of a copper zeolite, Cu-ZSM-5, that readily oxidizes methane to methanol at
100 C [81]. Mechanistic characterization of this complex revealed that O2
binding ﬁrst results in a μ-η2:η2-peroxo Cu2
II complex followed by subsequent
conversion to a reactive bent mono-μ-oxo-CuII
2 species [82–84]. Electrons for
the process are proposed to come from spectator CuI ions in the zeolite.
DFT calculations on this compound suggested the C–H activation step occurs at
the bridging oxygen, resulting in a transient [Cu–OH–Cu]2+ intermediate and
methyl radical that rapidly recombines with the copper-bound hydroxyl radical to
form methanol (Figures 5 and 6). Until further characterization of pMMO is
carried out, it is unknown which, if any, of these mechanistic possibilities
accurately represent the O2 activation events and the essential catalytic interme-
diate in the enzyme.

2.5.3
Mechanism of C–H Bond Breaking
The C–H bond activation steps in pMMO and sMMO have been examined by using
substrate probes to differentiate between cationic, alkyl radical, or concerted
oxygen insertion mechanisms (Figure 6). These probes generally fall into two
classes, chiral substrates and radical clock probes, the latter of which are too
large to be accommodated by the pMMO active site. Reactions of pMMO with
the (S) or (R)-[1-3H1,2H1] ethane and [2,2-2H2] butane assessed the reactivity of
pMMO toward a chiral methyl group [27, 85, 86]. An inversion of conﬁguration
suggested rotation about the C–C bond of a radical or cationic ethyl intermediate.
The calculated lifetime of such an intermediate, given the barrier of C–C bond
rotation in an ethyl radical (0.15 kcal mol1 at 30 C), is ~180 fs [85]. Reactions
with M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO revealed complete retention of conﬁguration,
suggesting a concerted mechanism in which an oxygen atom is inserted between the
C–H bond of a pentacoordinated species having either a C–O or C–Cu bond.
A radical or cationic rebound mechanism exhibiting complete retention would
have to occur faster than 10 fs in order to avoid detectable C–C bond rotation.
This latter scenario is not feasible because it would require that radical capture be
faster than the calculated rate constant for the decay of the transition state
(6.6  1012 s1 at 45 C). However, given that pMMO has a narrow substrate-
binding pocket, a mechanism invoking a bound radical with highly restricted
rotation cannot be ruled out.
2.6
Unresolved Questions
Despite the progress made in the last 15 years, there are numerous unresolved
questions concerning the structure and mechanism of pMMO. There is a great need
for higher resolution structural data to further deﬁne the geometry and the solvent
contributions to the resting dicopper active site. A better starting place for thinking
about the pMMO mechanism is required, especially for those pursuing synthetic
catalysts, model complexes, and computational studies.
Similarly, improvements in puriﬁcation of both native pMMO and the spmoB
construct are needed to facilitate more extensive mechanistic studies using time-
resolved spectroscopic methods. Further insight into the structure of the long-lived
peroxo species and discovery of new intermediates along the reaction pathway
will provide a stronger framework for zeroing in on a mechanism for O2 and C–H
bond activation by this unique dicopper center. Finally, it is unknown how the
requisite substrates are assembled at the metal center with appropriate timing in
order to achieve efﬁcient coupling of the different chemical processes. Resolving
this question requires better understanding of the role of the large protein scaffold
into which the dicopper unit is embedded and how both substrates and products are
channeled to and from the active site in a controlled fashion. Much important work
remains to be done.

Soluble Methane Monooxygenase
3.1
Genetics and System Components
3.1.1
Soluble Methane Monooxygenase
Soluble methane monooxygenase is a three-component enzyme system requiring a
251-kDa hydroxylase MMOH (mmoXYZ), a 38-kDa reductase MMOR (mmoC), and a
16-kDa regulatory or effector protein MMOB (mmoB) for optimal activity (Figure 7) [8,
10].MMOHtakestheformofan(αβγ)2heterodimerandhousesthecarboxylate-bridged
diiron active site ~12–14 Å below the surface of the hydroxylase α-subunit. MMOR, a
[2Fe-2S]- and FAD-containing reductase, supplies electrons to the hydroxylase by
consuming NADH. MMOB, a cofactorless protein, up-regulates activity by binding to
the hydroxylase α-subunit near the diiron center to induce changes in the protein
architecture that efﬁciently couple NADH consumption with substrate oxidation.
The sMMO operon from several methanotrophs has been sequenced and con-
tains additional genes that are hypothesized to encode for proteins important for
controlling expression and assembly of the system (Figure 7b) [87–90]. In the
middle of the catalytic gene sequences is mmoD (formerly orfY), which encodes
for a protein of unknown function (MMOD) and inhibits sMMO activity by
competing with MMOB for the same binding site on MMOH [91, 92]. Comparisons
to DmpK (also known as PHK) in related phenol hydroxylase systems have
suggested that MMOD could play a role in the metal center assembly of MMOH,
although this hypothesis has yet to be proved. MMOD has also been proposed to
serve as a transcriptional regulator of the sMMO operon [93]. Downstream of the
sMMO genes are mmoQ, mmoS, mmoR and mmoG. The mmoR gene encodes for a
Figure 7 (a) sMMO components. (b) sMMO operon from M. capsulatus (Bath).

σ54-dependent transcriptional activator thought to control the copper-dependent
expression of sMMO. MMOQ and MMOS, which show signiﬁcant homology with
two-component sensor-regulator systems, have been proposed to activate the
σ54-dependent transcriptional activator, but exactly how these proteins sense the
cell environment and interact has yet to be established [87, 94, 95]. Lastly, MMOG
is a putative GroEL-like protein-folding chaperone that may facilitate proper
assembly of MMOH and the transcriptional activator [87, 89, 96]. The organization
and composition of the sMMO operon varies among the different methanotrophs.
Given the complex structure of MMOH and the extra genes required for its
assembly, it is not surprising that no one has yet generated a robust heterologous
expression system for the hydroxylase despite numerous attempts and claims.
Consequently, almost all studies on MMOH have been conducted on native
protein puriﬁed from either Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a thermophile with
an optimal growth temperature at 45 C, or Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, a
mesophile with optimal growth at 30 C. The hydroxylase components from
other BMMs, such as toluene 4-monooxygenase, (T4MO), toluene/o-xylene
monoxygenase (ToMO), and PH (phenol hydroxylase), have been recombinantly
expressed in E. coli [97–99]. These alternate systems allow conserved residues and
structural features within these proteins to be probed by mutagenesis. Thus, some
of the ideas about sMMO function presented below rely on analysis of and
comparisons to related BMM systems.
3.1.2
Related Bacterial Multicomponent Monooxygenases
and Substrate Speciﬁcities
sMMO is the most well characterized member of a larger family of bacterial
multicomponent monooxygenases that can be subcategorized into sMMO/alkane
monooxygenases (MMOs), four-component alkene/aromatic monooxygenases
(TMOs), phenol hydroxylases, alkene monooxygenases (AMOs), tetrahydrofuran
monooxygenases (THFMOs), and hyperthermophilic aromatic/alkene monooxy-
genases [100, 101]. Enhanced environmental screening and genomic sequencing
have expanded the diversity and scope of these subfamilies since the genetics were
last reviewed [101]. All of these systems utilize the same protein components, a
hydroxylase, a regulatory protein, and a reductase. Members of the four-component
toluene monooxygenases require both a ﬂavin and Rieske protein to shuttle
electrons to the hydroxylase. These different systems, which evolved to hydroxy-
late or epoxidize speciﬁc hydrocarbons for efﬁcient carbon and energy assimilation
in lower metabolic pathways, have relatively ﬂexible substrate binding pockets
that accommodate numerous alternate substrates.
The hydroxylase
α-subunits are the most conserved among the different
classes and share ~21–35 % sequence identity to MMOH and related alkane
monooxygenases. Even though the residues that contribute to the assembly of the
diiron center are conserved and the active site structures of related family members
are similar, if not identical, to that of MMOH [102–104], none of these other
systems can hydroxylate methane. sMMO is a special member of this enzyme
222
Sazinsky and Lippard

class. Even the 65 % identical butane monoxygenase cannot activate methane
[105], suggesting there are highly relevant and fundamental structure function
relationships between the metal center and protein scaffold that are essential for
tuning reactivity toward small alkanes.
3.2
Component Structures and Function
3.2.1
Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Hydroxylase
The 251-kDa hydroxylase component is an (αβγ)2 heterodimer with a 2-fold axis of
symmetry (Figure 7) [106, 107]. A large canyon is formed at the interface between
the αβγ protomer in the middle of the molecule that is important for the docking of
the other protein components. The diiron center is located in the α-subunit and housed
within a four-helix bundle comprising helices B, C, E, and F, the latter two of which
form a surface of the canyon that is critical for binding MMOB and undergo helical
rearrangements upon protein component binding (Figure 8) [108]. The remainder of
Figure 8 sMMO α-subunit depicting the hydrophobic cavities (1, 2, and 3). Iron atoms are shown
as black spheres. Helices E, F, H, and 4, which are the primary MMOB docking surfaces
on MMOH, are shaded light gray.

the protein, particularly the α-subunit, plays an important role in coordinating the
efﬁcient assembly and activation of the different substrates (electrons, protons, hydro-
carbon, and dioxygen) at the active site using a series of hydrophobic cavities,
hydrogen bonding networks, and electron transfer pathways (Figure 8) [109, 110].
At different times during the reaction cycle, MMOB and MMOR dock on to
MMOH and induce changes in MMOH that are not only responsible for activating
the diiron center, but may also help to coordinate the catalytic events [111].
The hydroxylase can accommodate the binding of two molecules of MMOB and
MMOR, one on each face of the hydroxylase. Optimal activity in M. capsulatus
(Bath) MMOH, however, is observed with a 1:2:0.5 H:B:R ratio, suggesting
that MMOR binds transiently to the hydroxylase and services multiple diiron
centers [111]. In the absence of MMOB, MMOH functions primarily as an
NADH oxidase. More details about the speciﬁc effects of each component, the
shuttling of substrates, and the coordination of catalytic events are discussed below.
3.2.2
The Reductase and Electron Transfer to the Hydroxylase
MMOR is a typical reductase with an N-terminal [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (MMORFd)
domain and a C-terminal FAD-binding (MMORFAD) domain. NMR structures of
the individual domains from M. capsulatus (Bath) are available [112, 113]
(Figure 7). Electron transfer kinetics in the sMMO systems have been investigated
in detail by using stopped-ﬂow optical spectroscopy [114–117] (Figure 9).
Brieﬂy, after the binding of NADH to the MMORFAD domain, the ﬁrst
electron transfer event produces the two-electron reduced FAD hydroquinone
(FADH) and NAD+. Following the release of NAD+, a one-electron transfer
step produces the ﬂavin semiquinone (FADH•) and the reduced [2Fe-2S] interme-
diates. Two successive electron transfer steps ultimately yield the reduced
hydroxylase, MMOHred. The reduction potentials of the MMOR cofactors are not
affected by the hydroxylase or the regulatory protein [117].
3.2.3
The Regulatory Protein and Interactions with the Hydroxylase
MMOB is organized into a structured 95 amino acid core with ﬂexible N- and
C-terminal tails of 35 and 11 amino acids, respectively [118, 119] (Figure 7).
A newly available structure shows that it docks onto the MMOH α-subunit in the

canyon region on top of helices E and F, which contribute glutamate and histidine
ligands to the diiron center (Figure 10) [108]. The protein enhances the steady state
reactivity of sMMO by 8–150 fold [108, 120], accelerates the rate of O2 activation
by the reduced metal center by 1000-fold [121], efﬁciently couples NADH
consumption to substrate hydroxylation, alters the spectroscopic and redox proper-
ties of the diiron center, and inﬂuences the regio- and stereospeciﬁcity of the
sMMO-catalyzed reaction [8, 10, 122]. Similar phenomena are observed in
the other BMM systems [122–124]. A long-standing goal is to understand how
the structural changes that shift the relative population of hydroxylase molecules
into an active conformation account for the altered properties of the activated
enzyme. The speciﬁcs of these changes in relation to sMMO activation are
discussed in Section 3.4.2.
Also relevant to the activation process are contributions from the MMOB
N-terminus that forms a ring-like structure when docked onto the surface of the
MMOH α-subunit [108]. Removing residues from the N-terminus yields protein
forms that have slightly diminished afﬁnity for MMOH with signiﬁcant loss of
activity [108, 125–127]. Nevertheless, a N-terminal truncate of MMOB lacking
the ﬁrst 12 residues failed to alter the redox potentials of the hydroxylase diiron
center [125]. The combined data indicate the MMOB N-terminus is essential for the
regulatory protein to trigger important structural changes in MMOH required for
activity. Similarly, MMOB C-terminal deletions have measurable effects on
reaction rates and the efﬁcient formation of sMMO intermediates [128].

3.3
The Diiron Center
The MMOH carboxylate-bridged diiron center has been the subject of numerous
spectroscopic and structural investigations to ascertain how this metal unit activates
dioxygen and hydrocarbons. These experiments, conducted in the presence and
absence of the other protein components, substrates, products, and other chemical
probes, have provided a considerable amount of information, not all of which is
directly relevant to the focus of this chapter on catalysis. As the different mecha-
nistic aspects are discussed, it is important to remember that it was the X-ray crystal
structure of MMOH in the resting diiron(III) state (MMOHox), solved in the
absence of MMOB, that provided the foundation for interpreting much of
the data relevant to the sMMO catalytic cycle (Figure 11).
The oxidized (MMOHox) and reduced (MMOHred) forms of MMOH are the
most stable and therefore have received the most structural and spectroscopic
scrutiny.

The Oxidized Hydroxylase
MMOHox has two high-spin FeIII ions that are coordinated by four glutamates and
two histidines (Figure 12a) [107, 129, 130]. The iron atoms lie ~3.0–3.1 Å apart and
are bridged by two solvent derived hydroxide ligands, which antiferromagnetically
couple the iron ions and lead to a diamagnetic ground state with a characteristic
Mo¨ssbauer spectrum [131–134]. Glu243 shows the most positional variability in
the different X-ray structures of MMOHox. It forms hydrogen bonds to either the
terminal water on Fe1 or the bridging hydroxides [130].
The hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket lies distal to the coordinating
histidines in front of the bridging hydroxide. Behind the diiron center, leading
10 Å from the histidine residues to helix A on the canyon surface of the hydrox-
ylase, is an extensive hydrogen bonding network that is strictly conserved among
the different BMMs (Figure 12c). The network may assist in the assembly of the
diiron center. Functional roles, such as involvement in electron transfer, have yet to
be established.

3.3.2
The Reduced Hydroxylase
Upon reduction of MMOH to the diiron(II) state (MMOHred), both hydroxides are
protonated to generate water, one of which is displaced when Glu243 undergoes a
carboxylate shift to bind in a bridging, bidentate chelating mode to Fe2 (Figure 12b)
[129, 130]. The remaining water stays coordinated to Fe1 and binds weakly to Fe2,
based on the longer Fe–O distance. As a result of these changes, the Fe–Fe distance
increases to 3.3–3.4 Å [135], and a possible coordination site opens up on Fe2.
MMOHred is a weakly ferromagnetically coupled high-spin system with a charac-
teristic EPR signal at g ¼ 16 [132, 134, 136–138]. This EPR signal has been
valuable for tracking the reaction of MMOHred with O2.
Additional conformational changes of interest occur near the active site when
MMOHox is reduced in the absence of MMOB. Asn214, which sits above the diiron
center on helix E, undergoes a rotomer shift from the protein surface to the interior
(Figure 13) [130].
This shift most likely occurs because reduction breaks water-mediated hydrogen
bonding interactions between Glu243 and Asn214. Such a mechanism suggests
how movement of residues at the diiron center can trigger conformational changes
on the protein surface. The rotomer change in Asn214 leads to the formation of a
small pore from the surface to the active site that has been proposed as pathway by
which hydrocarbons, dioxygen or protons can access the metal center or by which
hydrophilic products like water and alcohols may leave [109, 110]. The structure
of the MMOH-MMOB complex, however, reveals that MMOB docks to the
hydroxylase on top of the pore and forms a hydrogen bond directly to Asn214 via
its conserved residue, Ser111 (Figure 13b) [108]. A similar interaction occurs in
structures of related BMM complexes [103, 104]. The exact function of Asn214 in
sMMO and other BMM homologues is under investigation.

Protein Component Complexes
Understanding the interactions of MMOR and MMOB with the hydroxylase is
essential for unraveling how sMMO efﬁciently performs its challenging catalytic
task. Complexes formed between the different protein components play crucial
roles in orchestrating the electron transfer, oxygen-activation, and hydrocarbon-
activation events at the MMOH diiron center. Broadly stated, MMOR and MMOB
can be viewed as having two very general regulatory functions, to control the
movement of substrates to the active site and to alter the hydroxylase structure in
such a way as to make the diiron center more reactive. How the components
accomplish these tasks remains a focus of intense investigation.
3.4.1
Reductase Binding and Effects on the Hydroxylase
Initial chemical cross-linking studies between M. trichosporium (OB3b) MMOR
and MMOH indicated that the reductase binds to the β-subunit [120]. More recent
cross-linking studies on M. capsulatus (Bath) using just the MMORFd domain
suggest that the primary interaction is actually with the MMOH α-subunit [139].
Spectroscopic studies of the MMOR-MMOH complex have shown that the reduc-
tase does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence properties of the hydroxylase diiron center [8],
however, both MMOR and MMOB alter the redox potentials of MMOH [125, 131,
140–143]. Although there is some debate in the literature over their exact values,
the general trends reﬂecting the effects of the different components on the MMOH
redox potentials are consistent. Binding of MMOB decreases the potentials of the
diiron center by ~100–200 mV, making it harder to reduce, whereas the docking of
MMOR restores the potentials to the level observed before MMOB binding
to MMOH to favor reduction. These changes are consistent with recent results
indicating that MMOB displaces MMOR when it binds to MMOH [144].
Important questions concerning electron transfer in the sMMO system are
where MMOR docks to MMOH and what is the electron transfer pathway through
the hydroxylase to the diiron active site. An application of Marcus Theory to the
electron transfer rates between MMORFd and MMOH estimates that the [2Fe-2S]
cluster rests ~11–14 Å from the dinuclear iron center [114]. This distance is con-
sistent with theories of efﬁcient electron transfer rates in biological systems that
generally position electron donors and acceptors within 14 Å of each other [145].
It should be noted that MMOB and MMOR do not form complexes with one
another. Although it was previously suggested that they do not compete for the
same binding site on MMOH [111, 120], the most recent studies indicate otherwise.
In particular, they demonstrate that the MMOR Fd [Fe2S2] cluster docks near
MMOH residues N214 and E240, the latter of which undergoes a conformational
change that can facilitate the shuttling of both protons and electrons to the diiron
center [144, 204]. MMOB, however, has a higher afﬁnity for MMOHred than
MMOHox and can displace MMOR from the reduced hydroxylase. Consequently,
MMOB can regulate the electron transfer process and possibly serve to prevent the
quenching of the activated oxygen intermediates by MMOR.

3.4.2
Hydroxylase Activation by the Regulatory Protein
Before its crystal structure was determined, extensive spectroscopic interrogation
of the MMOH-MMOB complex indicated that MMOB affects the electronic
properties of the diiron center but alters its structure little. Correlating speciﬁc
electronic changes with concrete structural modiﬁcations has been difﬁcult,
especially when trying to ascertain the structures of the different intermediates
in the catalytic cycle. XAS studies of oxidized and reduced MMOH from
Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium (OB3b), which
offer the most direct method for probing changes in coordination geometry, ligand
type and number, and metal-ligand distances in the absence of a crystal structure,
indicated that MMOB had no remarkable affect on the spectra or ﬁtting parameters
of MMOHox or MMOHred [135, 146]. The only notable difference was that the
Debye-Waller factors, a measure of thermal order for a ﬁt atom, decrease [147].
This ﬁnding suggested that binding of the regulatory protein to the hydroxylase
serves to limit the motion of the metal coordinating ligands.
EPR spectroscopic investigations of MMOHox that was cryo-reduced at 77 K by
γ-radiation to produce an EPR active mixed-valent FeIIFeIII dimetallic center that
maintains the structure of MMOHox revealed that the addition of MMOB has no
observable affect on the oxidized diiron(III) cluster [148]. In the presence of
products like methanol and phenol, however, spectral changes in γ-irradiated
MMOHox occur when MMOB is added and indicated that MMOB inﬂuences the
manner by which exogenous ligands bind to the metal center. Consistent with this
notion is the observation that MMOB promotes DMSO and glycerol coordination to
MMOHox, whereas in the absence of MMOB, the binding of these compounds is
undetectable. MMOB also induces a spectral change in the g ¼ 1.84 EPR signal of
chemically reduced MMOHmv, indicating that MMOB can alter the magnetic
coupling of the metal center [120]. For MMOHred, the characteristic g ¼ 16 EPR
signal of fully reduced hydroxylase is not altered signiﬁcantly in the presence of
MMOB [120, 132, 133, 136, 137].
Further investigation of MMOHred by circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic
circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy demonstrated that MMOB inﬂuences the
structure of the fully reduced diiron center by altering the ligand ﬁeld environment
of only one of the iron atoms [149, 150]. The ligand ﬁeld environment of the second
iron atom only changes when MMOB is bound to MMOH in the presence of
substrates and inhibitors. Although it is unknown which speciﬁc iron atom experi-
ences these different effects, the data appear consistent with EPR results suggesting
that MMOB helps to generate open coordination sites at the diiron center for
dioxygen activation [149, 150]. Rapid freeze quench (RFQ) EPR spectroscopic
experiments reveal that MMOB increases the rate of O2 association with the
enzyme by 1000-fold, which corroborates this assessment and demonstrates how
MMOB can either accelerate the formation of intermediates or facilitate dioxygen
access to the active site [121]. The structural changes observed in the MMOH-
MMOB complex tend to support the latter function [108]. Recent double electron-
electron resonance spectroscopic studies indicate that the redox state of the diiron
center strongly effects the conformation of the MMOB N-terminus on the surface of
230
Sazinsky and Lippard

MMOH. In particular, binding to the reduced protein better orders the ﬂexible
N-terminal tail of MMOB, allowing Tyr8 to interact with MMOH and exert its
allosteric effects that allow passage of substrate to the cavity at the active site diiron
center [144].
A phenomenon commonly observed in the steady state turnover of sMMO is a
change in the product distribution when MMOB is added to the reconstituted
system [151]. For example, without MMOB the hydroxylation of propane,
butane, and nitrobenzene by MMOH yields 61 % 1-propanol, 6 % 1-butanol, and
10 % p-nitrophenol. With MMOB, yields of 93 % 1-propanol, 56 % 1-butanol,
and 90 % p-nitrophenol are achieved. The general trend for the many substrates
that have been tested with sMMO is that MMOB shifts regiospeciﬁcity such that
mostly primary alcohols and para-substituted aromatic alcohols are formed.
In other words, MMOB changes the morphology of the active site such that the
primary carbon on alkanes and the C4 position on mono-substituted aromatics are
preferentially presented to the activated oxygen species at the diiron center. Similar
changes in regiospeciﬁcity are observed in the toluene monooxygenase systems
when the regulatory protein is added [152], suggesting the general structural effect
is conserved among BMMs. Initial insight into the regulatory protein-dependent
regiospeciﬁcity changes was provided by the structure of a 6-bromohexanol-soaked
MMOH crystal in which an unexpected
α- to π-helix transition in MMOH
helix E elongated the active site pocket and increased its overall volume [109].
The structures of the MMOH-MMOB, PHH-PHM, and T4MOH-T4MOD com-
plexes later revealed a similar structural change, in addition to new ones that would
explain some, but not all, of the observations described above.
3.4.3
Structures of Regulatory Protein-Hydroxylase Complexes
The long sought structure of the MMOH-MMOB complex was solved to 2.9 Å
resolution and published in 2013 (Figure 10) [108]. The structure not only con-
ﬁrmed many previously generated ideas about the complex based on the available
biochemical information but also revealed intriguing new structural changes that
stand in contrast to the structures of related BMM hydroxylase-regulatory protein
complexes. The folded MMOB core docks onto MMOH α-subunit helices A, E,
and F in the canyon of the α2β2 interface while the long N-terminal tail forms a
ring-shaped structure on the α-subunit surface over helices H and 4 (Figure 8).
MMOB-induced conformational changes in the hydroxylase are observed primarily
in helices E, F, H, and 4. As observed in the 6-bromohexanol-soaked structure of
MMOH, residues 212–216 on helix E undergo a small α- to π-helix transition,
resulting in conserved Thr213 shifting away from the active site toward the
interface between helices E and F (Figure 14). Asn214 moves toward the hydrox-
ylase surface to hydrogen bond with Ser111 of MMOB, and Leu216 slides into the
back of the active site cavity 1. The net effect is a lengthening of the substrate
binding pocket. Glu209, a ligand to Fe2, is shifted slightly away from its original
position in the MMOH structure, but the coordination geometry to the metal center
appears unchanged.

231

On helix F, residues 240–244 wind more tightly, resulting in the rotation of
Glu240 toward the interface between helices E and F (Figure 14). This con-
ﬁguration is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions between Glu240 and
Thr213 on MMOH and Ser111 on MMOB (Figure 13b). Concomitant with these
movements in helices E and F, Glu243 undergoes a carboxylate shift (Figure 15).
The positional adjustments in helices H and 4 most likely stem from a repacking
of the interface between helices E and F and an optimization of interactions
with the MMOB N-terminus. These latter adjustments do not appear to directly
inﬂuence the active site or the various cavities within the hydroxylase, but
may have other, yet undetermined roles. Similar re-arrangements of helices
E and F occur in the phenol hydroxylase and toluene 4-monooxygenase systems
[103, 104].

3.4.4
The Activated Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Diiron Center
From the MMOH-MMOB structure, it is clear that the changes in the conformations
and positions of helixes E and F propagate toward the diiron center and affect the
coordination environment. The “observed” changes, however, must be interpreted
with a degree of caution. First, the limited 2.9-Å resolution of the structure does not
allow for clear visualization of solvent-derived ligands and will affect the accuracy
by which it is possible to model the positions of the amino acid ligands. Second,
although the oxidized form of the MMOH-MMOB complex was crystallized, it is
conceivable that the X-ray beam led to cryo-reduction of the metal center by one or
two electrons to form the mixed-valent or fully reduced state, respectively. As a
result, the oxidation state of the diiron center in the MMOH-MMOB structure is
uncertain. The metal center has geometric features that are similar to those of both
MMOHox and MMOHred (Figure 15). The carboxylate shift in Glu243 is similar to
the one in MMOHred but the average Fe–Fe distance in each of the four metal
centers found in the asymmetric unit of the crystal is 3.1 Å, a value closer to the
3.0–3.1 Å distance observed in MMOHox as opposed to the 3.3–3.4 Å distance in
MMOHred and MMOHmv [130].
Although it is a low-resolution structure, some of the iron ligands in the MMOH-
MMOB complex seem to adopt new geometries. Glu114 appears to assume a
bidentate chelating mode of coordination to Fe1. Glu144 also adjusts its coordina-
tion to the iron atoms. In one active site, the side chain rotates by 90 such that the
two carboxylate oxygen atoms are orthogonal to the Fe–Fe vector (Figure 15a).
In another active site, one oxygen atom bridges both irons and Fe2 is coordinated in
a bidentate chelating fashion (Figure 15b). These new conﬁgurations for Glu114

and Glu144 may be in response to gross lateral movement of helices E and F that
force Glu209, Glu243, His246, and the iron atoms to translate toward the
C-terminus of helix F (Figure 15c and 16).
An overlay of the MMOHox and MMOH-MMOB structures shows the positions
of Fe1 and Fe2 to shift by 0.7 Å and 1.3 Å, respectively, to accommodate the helical
motions and new positions of some of the amino acid ligands. Because helices B
and C do not move much, it is possible that the side-chains of Glu114, Glu144, and
His147 on these helices are forced to adjust accordingly to maintain interactions
with the iron atoms (Figures 15 and 16). To support this lateral movement along the
axis of the four-helix bundle, the hydrogen bonding patterns of the second coordi-
nation sphere near Glu209 and Fe2 rearrange. Most notably, Gln140 is no longer in
contact with Glu209 and Glu144 (Figure 16).

3.4.5
Comparisons to Toluene Monooxygenases
and Phenyl Hydroxylase
One important question in the BMM ﬁeld is, “Why do the other BMMs not
hydroxylate methane?” In the absence of the regulatory protein, the structures of
the oxidized and reduced ToMOH and T4MOH diiron centers are nearly identical
to those in MMOH [102, 104, 153]. The most glaring difference between sMMO
and the TMOs is the occurrence of a long, 30-Å channel in the α-subunit that is
required to transport aromatic substrates to the diiron center. This channel contrasts
with the cavities in MMOH that follow a similar, but not identical, route through the
α-subunit. It is unlikely that the channel affects hydroxylation chemistry, although
the greater solvent access in TMOs was a concern because high-valent intermedi-
ates could be quenched if the activated metal center were not protected [102].
The global structures of the PHH-PHM and T4MOH-T4MOD complexes are
similar to that of MMOH-MMOB with the regulatory protein binding over
α-subunit helices A, E, and F in the hydroxylase canyon region. Despite having a
much shorter N-terminus, the regulatory protein in these related BMM systems
induces nearly identical conformation changes in helices E and F near the diiron
center, demonstrating a conserved method for “activating” the hydroxylases.
The one surprise from these structures is that the helical changes collapse the
substrate channel to create a single pocket near the active site, while simultaneously
opening up access to other α-subunit cavities [104]. These cavities were later
identiﬁed as a major route for O2 access to the metal center in ToMO [65].
The electron density around the diiron center of the 2.3 Å PHH-PHM structure is
difﬁcult to interpret and there are questions about the oxidation state of the metal
center and overall occupancy of PHM in the crystal structure. For T4MOH-D,
structures of the oxidized and reduced diiron centers look similar to the ones found
in MMOHox and MMOHred, (Figures 12 and 17). Although it is difﬁcult to make
informative comparisons to the metal center geometry observed in the low resolu-
tion structure of the MMOH-B complex at this time, a signiﬁcant difference
between the structures of TMO and sMMO hydroxylase-regulatory protein com-
plexes lies in the second coordination sphere.
Near Fe1 in T4MOH, Glu104 hydrogen bonds with Gln141, which may serve to
constrain the position of this iron ligand, as does a water molecule in MMOH
(Figure 17) [203]. If Glu114 does in fact alter its conﬁguration in the MMOH-
MMOB complex, this difference could be one contributing factor. On the opposite
side of the active site near Fe2, the hydrogen bonding patterns are unaltered in the
T4MOH and T4MOH-D structures, suggesting a rigid assembly of the T4MOH
metal center. By contrast, this network reconﬁgures in MMOH when the regulatory
protein is bound (Figure 16). A relaxing of hydrogen bonding interactions between
Gln140 and the coordinating Glu209 and Glu144 ligands possibly affords the
sMMO diiron center more conformational freedom. It is tempting to speculate
that the additional conformational constraints in other BMM systems prevent
them from achieving the high-valent Q intermediate observed sMMO responsible
for activating high energy C–H bonds in alkanes.

3.5
Substrate Access to the Catalytic Diiron Center
A challenge for all BMM systems is to deliver substrates to the diiron center
with the appropriate timing to support catalysis (Figure 11). The structure of the
hydroxylase has suggested deﬁned routes for O2, hydrocarbon, electrons, and protons
to the active site. The timing of delivery of these substrates is critical, not only for
maximum catalytic efﬁciency, but also to avoid unwanted events such as quenching-
activated oxygen intermediates. Such quenching leads to the uncoupling of electron
consumption from productive utilization of oxygen to convert methane to methanol.
Otherwise, MMOH can become an NADH oxidase. In the next section we describe
pathways for substrate access and product egress during the catalytic cycle.
3.5.1
Cavities for O2 and Hydrocarbons
Several hydrophobic cavities have been identiﬁed in the MMOH α-subunit, three
of which, (cavities 1, 2, and 3) bind xenon, halogenated alkanes, and alcohols of up
to eight carbon atoms in length (Figure 8) [109, 110, 154]. The entrance to each
cavity is gated by a set of hydrophobic residues that adopt alternate rotomer
conformations in MMOH crystal structures with different product alcohols

bound. Cavities 1 and 2 are discontinuous and separated by Leu110 (not shown) and
Phe188 (Figure 18a). Cavities 2 and 3 are continuous, but somewhat restricted near
Val105, Phe109 and Leu289. The opening and closing of these gates have been
proposed as a means for controlling substrate entrance to and/or product egress
from the active site pocket (cavity 1) during catalysis [109, 155]. Structures of
MMOHred show no changes in cavity structure or positioning of the amino acid
gates. Binding of MMOB to the hydroxylase, and subsequent changes in helices E
and F, however, force a repositioning of the Leu110 and Phe188 side chains,
connecting cavities 1 and 2 such that a pathway extends from the protein surface
through the α-subunit to the active site (Figure 18b and 18c). Thus, one of the major
functions of MMOB is to facilitate the creation of a freely diffusible space for
methane and dioxygen to access the diiron center [108].
The best evidence that these cavities are functional comes from studies of the
TMO system. The structure of the T4MOH-D complex reveals a similar series of
cavities through the hydroxylase α-subunit once the regulatory protein binds and

interface between cavities 2 and 3 are not visible in this orientation of the structure. The ﬁgure

collapses the aromatic substrate channel leading to the active site [104].
Taking advantage of a Thr201Ser mutation in ToMOH that allows observation of
the reaction of O2 with the reduced diiron center, optical stopped-ﬂow spectro-
scopic investigations of ToMOH variants that restrict or enhance O2 passage
through the cavities revealed that the hydroxylase uses this ~40 Å route as a primary
pathway for controlling O2 diffusion to the iron center [65]. The inability to express
sMMOH in a heterologous host has thus far prevented similar experiments being
conducted with this enzyme.
In addition to the cavities, a hydrophilic pore formed between MMOH helices E
and F involving Asn214, Thr213, and Glu240 was hypothesized to provide the most
direct route for the passage of small gaseous substrates or product alcohols to and
from the diiron center [109]. Redox dependent shifts in Asn214 rearrange the
orientation of amino acid side chains comprising the pore. Because the regulatory
protein docks on top of these helices in the different BMM hydroxylase-effector
complexes, the pathway leading from the diiron center to the surface through this
pore is blocked. Biochemical data showing that MMOB bound to the hydroxylase
surface signiﬁcantly decreases the rate of adventitious iron loss from reduced
MMOH, further supports the notion that MMOB can restrict the passage of
molecules to and from the diiron center through the pore [92].
Occlusion of the pore by MMOB as well as its hydrophilic character suggest
that the pore is unlikely to provide the route of hydrophobic gases to the active
site during the catalytic cycle, but dissociation of MMOB could generate a route
for hydrophilic methanol and water release at the conclusion of the reaction
cycle [108]. The importance of the pore for product release is supported by
steady-state and pre-steady state studies of MMOH using an MMOB Asn107Gly/
Ser109Ala/Ser110Ala/Thr111A quadruple variant that effectively sculpted the
MMOB surface oriented over the hydroxylase diiron center [156]. When monitor-
ing reactions with large substrates like nitrobenzene, this quadruple variant gener-
ated a two-fold increase in both steady-state turnover and the rate of product release
from the diiron center following oxidation. The rates of methane hydroxylation and
product release were unaffected. Work with the quad mutant suggests that product
alcohols can escape the enzyme through a pathway at the MMOH-B interface.
A major conclusion from all of this work is that the regulatory protein exerts
signiﬁcant control over the movement of compounds into and out of the active
site at different stages of the catalytic cycle.
3.5.2
Proton Delivery
The delivery of protons is required for reduction of the dimetallic center and the O2
activation steps of the sMMO catalytic cycle [157–159]. Solvent is considered the
primary source of the protons, but their pathway to the diiron center is largely
unknown. The structural changes in MMOH helices E and F near the pore suggest
a mechanism for proton delivery whereby movement of Glu240 from the
238
Sazinsky and Lippard

hydroxylase surface toward the interior initiates opening of the pore and formation
of a hydrogen bonding network at the MMOH-MMOB interface using conserved
Asn214, Thr213, and Ser111 on MMOB (Figures 13 and 14). Because these
residues are unlikely to directly ferry a proton, we propose that water or hydronium
ions, such as the one bridging Gln230 (Glu240 in MMOH) and the terminal water
coordinated to Fe1 in the T4MOH-D complex, may be important participants in this
relay process (Figure 17c).
Unfortunately, little work has been done to investigate the proposed proton
transfer pathway except for studies on the role of the conserved threonine in
TMOs. Mutagenesis of this residue in T4MOH and ToMOH revealed that substitu-
tion of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues at this position yields a less active
enzyme with efﬁcient coupling but altered substrate regiospeciﬁcity [159, 160].
The T4MOH Thr201Ala variant resulted in signiﬁcant release of hydrogen peroxide
from the enzyme following reaction with T4MOHDred with O2, suggesting this
threonine may help to stabilize the appropriate iron-bound activated oxygen inter-
mediates [161]. Further study in ToMOH indicated that Thr201 mutants affect
the formation and decay kinetics of a peroxodiiron(III) intermediate, and that this
residue plays a major role in the proton transfer steps required to generate this species
[159, 162]. If the route for proton relay involves Glu240, Asn214, and Thr213,
initializing this pathway relay for the controlled delivery of protons through the
pore may be one of the primary functions of regulatory proteins in the BMM family.
3.6
Dimetallic Activation of O2 and Methane
Efforts to unravel the sMMO mechanism have focused on how MMOH activates
dioxygen, the identity of intermediates that react with hydrocarbons, and how C–H
bonds are broken. A detailed understanding of the structures and properties of
the different intermediates has been of interest as many laboratories aim to
generate synthetic hydrocarbon oxidation catalysts based on a dimetallic iron
unit. Mechanistic studies have identiﬁed several intermediate species during rapid
kinetic experiments, some of which have overlapping properties that are difﬁcult to
deconvolute [9]. The fact that more than one intermediate can react with hydrocar-
bon substrates at one point in time led to confusion about the nature of the C–H
bond activation and oxygen insertion process [11]. Among the laboratories [9, 10]
focused on establishing a mechanism for the M. capsulatus (Bath) (Mc) and
M. trichosporium Ob3b (Mt) systems, there is general consensus as to the nature
of the major intermediates in the sMMO reaction cycle (Figure 11). Some disagree-
ment still exists as to what their exact structures are and how one might transition to
the next. In this section we ﬁrst discuss single-turnover kinetic studies aimed at
identifying the transient oxygen intermediates and their reactivity with substrates,
followed by studies focusing on the C–H bond-breaking steps.

3.6.1
Reaction of O2 with the Reduced Hydroxylase
The transfer of two electrons and two protons to the diiron(III) center of MMOHox
initiates the sMMO catalytic cycle by generating fully reduced MMOHred. Its
subsequent reaction with O2 is most efﬁcient when two equivalents of MMOB
are present, suggesting MMOB-induced conformational changes gate O2 access to
the activated metal center [121]. O2-promoted decay of MMOHred, which has
been monitored at 4 C in M. capsulatus (Bath) by RFQ Mo¨ssbauer and in
M. trichosporium OB3b by EPR spectroscopy, was measured to be 24 s1 at
pH 7.0 and 22 s1 at pH 7.7, respectively [141, 163]. The intermediate that forms
from the decay of MMOHred is P* (vide infra), but the absence of any observed pH
or O2 concentration dependence for the decay of Mt MMOHred suggested that a
rapid irreversible O2 binding event occurs before P* in which O2 is bound to the
hydroxylase but not to the diiron center. This intermediate, termed O, alternatively
was interpreted to represent a tight but reversible O2 Michaelis complex to
MMOHred. However, steady state experiments on Mc MMOH using an oxygen
electrode failed to provide any evidence for such a complex [164].
3.6.2
Peroxo Intermediates
After reaction with O2, peroxodiiron(III) intermediates are formed. Mo¨ssbauer data
at 4 K on rapid freeze-quenched samples of MMOHred mixed with O2 reveal a
quadrupole doublet with δ ¼ 0.66 mm s1 and ΔEQ ¼ 1.51 mm s1 [165, 166].
These parameters are indicative of an antiferromagnetically coupled, high-spin
diiron(III) center in which each FeIII ion has a similar coordination geometry.
UV-vis stopped-ﬂow spectroscopy revealed optical features at 420 nm and
720 nm in Mc MMOH and 700 nm in Mt MMOH [141, 166, 167]. Although the
decay constants of this intermediate measured by RFQ Mo¨ssbauer and stopped-ﬂow
UV-vis spectroscopy were similar in Mc MMOH (~0.36 s1 at 4 C), the measured
rate constants obtained by these methods for the formation of the peroxo intermediate
were signiﬁcantly different, namely, ~1 s1 by stopped-ﬂow and ~25 s1 by
Mo¨ssbauer [167]. This discrepancy suggested the existence of two peroxodiiron(III)
species, P* and Hperoxo, having similar Mo¨ssbauer properties but different,
overlapping optical signals. A re-examination of the intermediates in Mt MMOH by
stopped-ﬂow UV-vis spectroscopy required an additional intermediate preceding
Hperoxo to ﬁt the data. This intermediate, P*, which was presumed to have no optical
features at 420 nm, formed with a rate constant of 22–26 s1 at 4 C followed by
Hperoxo at ~9–12 s1 [168, 169]. This rate was consistent with earlier observations,
establishing P* as the ﬁrst intermediate resulting from MMOHred reacting with O2.
More recently, in a MMOB His33Ala variant in Mt MMOH, the conversion of P* to P
was retarded, facilitating the trapping of larger quantities for characterization [168].
This intermediate had Mo¨ssbauer parameters indicative of a diiron(II) center, no
signiﬁcant optical features, and no g ¼ 16 EPR signal that is characteristic of the
240
Sazinsky and Lippard

diiron(II) center in MMOHred. In contrast, subsequent UV-vis stopped ﬂow studies of
Mc MMOH in the presence of methane, to eliminate underlying optical signals
of intermediate Q, suggest that P* is an optically active diiron(III) center with
absorptionmaximaat420nm(ε ¼ 3500M1cm1)and720nm(ε ¼ 1250M1cm1)
that overlap with the ensuing Hperoxo and Q intermediates [205]. It is unclear, based
on the latter two investigations, whether or not P* in Mc MMOH is the same
intermediate as that observed in Mt MMOH.

Assuming P* to be a diiron(III) complex, the observation of optical bands is key,
for it allows for more informed comparisons to peroxodiiron(III) species in well
characterized model complexes and enzymes (Table 2). Based on similarities in
their optical and Mo¨ssbauer properties, P* and Hperoxo are expected to have a
μ-1,2-peroxo diiron(III) core but probably differ in the conﬁguration of surrounding
ligands. Possible peroxo structures are presented in Figure 19a and take into consi-
deration the different binding modes of Glu-243 (1–8). The gauche μ-1,2 conﬁgu-
ration of the [Fe2(μ-1,2-O2)(μ-O2CCH2Ph)2{HB(pz’)3}2] model complex is the
most interesting model because its Mo¨ssbauer parameters are nearly identical to
those of P* (3 or 4) [170]. Computational work also seems to favor this binding
mode as opposed to cis-μ-1,2 and μ- η2:η2 geometries (1, 2, and 7) [171, 172].
Interestingly, the optical and Mo¨ssbauer properties of the ToMOH peroxo inter-
mediate are quite different from those of the MMOH peroxo intermediate,
suggesting that the structure of the ToMOH peroxo species (possibly 5 or 6) is
the point of departure in their mechanisms [172–174].
The conversion of P* to Hperoxo is pH-dependent and has a kinetic solvent
isotope effect (KSIE) in D2O of kH/kD¼2.0 for Mc MMOH and kH/kD¼1.3 for Mt
MMOH [157, 158]. Fits to the data from both enzyme systems are consistent with
the kinetic model 1 in Figure 20. Given the similar spectroscopic parameters of
these intermediates, the major structural difference between P* and Hperoxo is
probably a proton transfer event that does not signiﬁcantly perturb the diiron(III)-
oxygen core (Figure 11). Because the spectroscopic properties of peroxo- and

hydroperoxo-diiron(III) species are expected to be signiﬁcantly different [175],
Glu243 was proposed to be the recipient of this proton [9]. Further work is required
to conﬁrm the structures of the P* and Hperoxo intermediates, which are important
unsolved questions.
3.6.3
Intermediates Q and Q*
Electron-rich substrates, like propylene and diethylether, react with Hperoxo to form
oxidized products and MMOHox via a two-electron transfer mechanism [167, 176,
177] (Figure 11). In the absence of such substrates, homolytic cleavage of the
Hperoxo O–O bond leads to formation of intermediate Q, the species responsible for
activating the C–H bond in methane. Q is an antiferromagnetically coupled
diiron(IV) intermediate with a bright yellow color and absorption maxima at
330 nm and 420 nm (Table 3) [141, 163, 165, 178]. The measured rate constants
for Q formation, 0.36 s1 and 2.5 s1 at 4 C in Mc and Mt MMOH, respectively,
coincide with the rate of Hperoxo decay [157, 169]. Mo¨ssbauer spectral studies of Q
from Mt MMOH show a single quadrupole doublet, indicating that both Fe(IV)
atoms have similar ligand environments [178]. This information, coupled with
an XAS spectrum of Mt Q ﬁt with a short Fe–Fe distance of 2.46 Å and Fe–O/N
bond lengths of 1.77 Å and 2.05 Å, lead to the interpretation of Q as being a
di(μ-oxo)diiron(IV) species (Figure 19b, 9) [166].
In the presence of methane, Q converts to MMOHprod (or MMOHox) with
rate constants of 3.9 s1 and 2.9 s1 at 4 C for Mc and Mt MMOH, respectively
[128, 157, 169]. In the absence of substrates, Q decays to MMOHox by acquiring
two electrons and two protons by a relatively uncharacterized process. An inter-
mediate in this decay pathway, Q*, was identiﬁed by UV-vis stopped-ﬂow
spectroscopy to have an absorption maximum at 420 nm, like Q, but a unique
shoulder at 455 nm that is unaffected by substrate concentration [157]. The formation
and decay rates for Q* were measured at 4 C in M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOH to be
0.01 s1 and 0.0028 s1, respectively. The reason for the formation of such an
intermediate is unclear, but, the collapse of Q to a non-reactive thermodynamically

more stable intermediate such as Q* in the absence of substrate may protect the active
site from radical initiated damage by the more reactive Q species.
The conversion Hperoxo to Q is pH-dependent and exhibits KSIEs of kH/kD ¼ 1.8
for Mc MMOH and kH/kD ¼ 1.4 for Mt MMOH, making Q formation a proton-
dependent step [157, 158]. Q to Q* conversion, on the other hand, is
pH-independent. Kinetic data for the pH dependent conversion of Hperoxo to Q are
best ﬁt in Mt MMOH by using single ionizing system and a pKa of 7.6 (Figure 20,
kinetic model 2). For this same step, Mc MMOH requires a doubly ionizing system
with pKa values of 7.8 and 7.2, suggesting a second proton transfer event during this
transformation (Figure 20, kinetic model 3). Accounting for all the available kinetic
data, proton-assisted heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond best describes the
possible series of transitions from P* to Q in Mc sMMO (Figure 11) [9, 157].
The discovery of Q* has added to a growing list of evidence suggesting the
structure of Q needs further evaluation. Unlike the Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of Mt Q in
which one quadrupole doublet was observed, early analysis of Mc Q samples
showed two quadrupole doublets of equal intensity [141, 165], suggesting the
presence of a second similar species that may be Q*. The long lifetime of Q* is a
concern with regard to the preparation of samples for RFQ Mo¨ssbauer and XAS.
For example, in the 186 seconds age time of the optical stopped ﬂow experiments
performed in the absence of substrate to examine the kinetics of the different Q
intermediates, it was estimated that 19 % and 60 % of the species present were Q
and Q*, respectively [157]. It is conceivable that ﬁts to XAS data on Mt MMOH

modeled Q* or an average of the two diiron(IV) intermediates as opposed to Q
alone. Adding to the concern, many DFT calculations fail to reproduce the short
Fe–Fe distance observed by XAS [179, 180]. To generate this intermediate, protein
scaffold may compress the iron atoms in order to achieve favorable energetic
conversion from Hperoxo to Q, as suggested by QM/MM studies [180].
Several synthetic catalysts that achieve a high-valent diiron species capable
of oxygen insertion between C–H bonds offer some insight into alternative possi-
bilities for the structure of Q, in which the oxidizing potency of the complex
is concentrated at a single FeIV¼O unit (Figure 20). As an example, a
[Fe2(H2Hbamb)2(N-melm)2] complex oxidized cyclohexane to cyclohexanol via
an FeIIFeIV intermediate with a terminal FeIV¼O species [181]. An analogous
FeIIIFeV center was suggested for Q in MMOH (10). A valence-delocalized

tris((4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-
pyrid-2-yl)d2-methyl)amine oxidized C–H bonds a million times faster than a
valence-delocalized “diamond core” analogue, [Fe3.5(μ-O)2Fe3.5]3+ [182]. In one
instance, oxidation by a complex with a [FeIV(μ-O)2FeIVL2]4+ core was 100 times
slower than the corresponding mononuclear Fe(IV)¼O complex using the same
ligand [183]. These ﬁndings suggest that a terminal Fe¼O unit (11 and 12) may be
more effective than a di(μ-oxo)diiron(IV) unit for C–H bond activation.
3.6.4
The Product-Bound Hydroxylase
The oxidation of substrates by Q leads to the product-bound state, MMOHprod.
This intermediate has only been kinetically observed for oxidation of nitrobenzene
to p-nitrophenol. Here, product release from the hydrophobic active site promotes
formation of the optically detectable p-nitrophenolate ion in solution [141, 163].
For this substrate, the rate of steady-state turnover is similar to the rate of product
release, indicating product release to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction, at least
when nitrobenzene is the substrate. Product displacement may be accomplished
either by ligand exchange with solvent or by reduction of the metal center to
reinitiate the catalytic cycle. Further studies of product release with other substrates
more similar to methane would be valuable.

The product-bound structures are consistent with EPR, ENDOR, UV-vis, and
resonance Raman spectroscopic characterization of MMOHprod in the absence of
MMOB [148, 184, 185]. The addition of MMOB inﬂuences exogenous ligand
binding to the diiron center, as indicated by EPR [148]. It is conceivable that the
structure of the diiron center in the MMOH-MMOB product complex is different
from the one observed in MMOH alone.

3.6.5
C–H Bond Activation by Different Intermediates
Like the O2-activation steps, C–H bond activation by sMMO has also received
signiﬁcant attention to determine the mechanism by which the different intermedi-
ates activate hydrocarbons. Mechanistic chiral alkane and radical clock substrate
probes that rearrange to speciﬁc products when a particular hydrocarbon interme-
diate is generated have been employed to qualitatively differentiate between
radical, cationic, and concerted mechanisms (Figure 6). The results of these exper-
iments were not straightforward and have been the subject of considerable debate,
reviewed thoroughly elsewhere [11]. Computational methods have added addi-
tional insight and, in some cases, explain some of the more paradoxical results.
Small chiral alkanes that closely mimic the natural sMMO substrate were used
as reporters for the H-atom abstraction mechanism by intermediate Q [186, 187].
In principle, a concerted mechanism would produce complete retention or inversion
of stereochemistry whereas radical and cationic intermediates would predict full
racemization (Figure 7). For M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b
sMMO, hydroxylation of (S) or (R)-[1-3H1,2H1] ethane yielded a 70:30 retention:
inversion of conﬁguration ratio. Reactions with [2-3H] butane exhibited ~90 %
retention. These results could be interpreted as evidence for a radical intermediate,
but to achieve 70 % retention of conﬁguration requires the ethyl radical to recom-
bine with the iron-bound hydroxyl radical at a rebound rate of 1  1013 s1 [188].
This large value excludes the possibility of a discrete radical intermediate, which
would racemize in less than 1  1010 s. DFT calculations provided some clarity
to this discrepancy, demonstrating that sMMO may have a “bound-radical”
intermediate with restricted rotation owing to weak interactions with the diiron
center [189].
Radical clock substrate probes offered an additional way to probe the C–H
activation process. For these substrates, H-atom or hydride abstraction by sMMO
leads to a radical or cationic intermediate on a constrained hydrocarbon substrate
that subsequently rearranges to produce a lower energy, less constrained product
alcohol. An example of this rearrangement is shown in Figure 21. Some probes
detect only radical products, whereas others, in theory, elegantly differentiate
between either a cationic or radical rearrangement [11].
Because the rate constant for the rearrangement of these substrates is known, it is
possible to estimate the lifetimes of transient species. Analysis of the reactions with
the various probes shows the predominant products to be unrearranged hydroxyl-
ated compounds. The minor products, however, were derived from both radical and
cationic intermediates. These contradictory ﬁndings, while perplexing, suggested
that sMMO utilizes more than one oxidizing species to activate C–H bonds.
Stopped-ﬂow spectroscopic experiments monitoring the reaction of Hperoxo
with propylene provided the ﬁrst direct evidence that this Q precursor is reactive
toward electron-rich substrates [167]. Further investigation of Hperoxo reactions
with ethers demonstrated that this intermediate reacts with more electron-rich
substrates faster than Q, via a two-electron transfer mechanism as opposed to
single-electron transfer steps by Q [176] (Figure 22).

A concern stemming from the work with radical clock substrates was the low
percentage of re-rearranged radical clock-derived products [11]. If Q were to react
with hydrocarbons via a traditional radical-based mechanism, a higher yield of
radical-derived products was expected. Like the chiral alkane results, DFT calcula-
tions suggest the low yields of radical-derived products are explained by a mecha-
nism using “bound radical” with restricted rotation (Figure 6) [189]. Calculations
examining a concerted mechanism indicated this pathway to be less favorable.

Concluding Remarks and Future Directions
In the last twenty-ﬁve years, investigations of the pMMO and sMMO systems,
including the organisms that utilize these enzymes, have considerably improved
our understanding of the biological transformation of methane to methanol at
dinuclear copper and iron centers. As the general picture of the O2 and C–H
activation processes becomes clear, attention now turns toward pursuing a more
detailed mechanistic understanding of the hydroxylation chemistry. In particular, it
is important to identify the structures of the activated dioxygen intermediates and to
sort out the intricacies of the electron and proton transfer events critical for the
conversion of one intermediate to the next for methane oxidation.
The controlled delivery of the requisite protons, electrons, oxygen, and hydro-
carbon substrates at the appropriate time in the catalytic cycle is essential for
efﬁcient hydroxylation chemistry. Failure to regulate when the different substrates
arrive at the active site would lead to uncoupling, quenching the activated oxygen
intermediates and forming hydrogen peroxide and/or water.
How sMMO controls the timing and assembly of substrates at its diiron center is
now reasonably well understood, but this information is lacking for the pMMO
system. With sMMO, having multiple protein components has made the process
challenging, and information about the electron transfer steps from MMOR to
MMOH is incomplete. Although we are much closer to understanding the intracies
of these enzymes, how the sMMO and pMMO protein scaffolds and metal centers
work in concert remains a continuing goal as we try to reveal how biology
masterfully tunes the reactivity of these unique dinuclear metal centers to carry
out their challenging hydroxylation chemistry.

Abstract Ammonium and methane are inert molecules and dedicated enzymes are
required to break up the N-H and C-H bonds. Until recently, only aerobic micro-
organisms were known to grow by the oxidation of ammonium or methane. Apart
from respiration, oxygen was speciﬁcally utilized to activate the inert substrates.
The presumed obligatory need for oxygen may have resisted the search for micro-
organisms that are capable of the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium and of meth-
ane. However extremely slowly growing, these “impossible” organisms exist and
they found other means to tackle ammonium and methane. Anaerobic ammonium-
oxidizing (anammox) bacteria use the oxidative power of nitric oxide (NO) by
forging this molecule to ammonium, thereby making hydrazine (N2H4). Nitrite-
dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers (N-DAMO) again take advantage of NO,
but now apparently disproportionating the compound into dinitrogen and dioxygen
gas. This intracellularly produced dioxygen enables N-DAMO bacteria to adopt an
aerobic mechanism for methane oxidation.
Although our understanding is only emerging how hydrazine synthase and the
NO dismutase act, it seems clear that reactions fully rely on metal-based catalyses
known from other enzymes. Metal-dependent conversions not only hold for these
key enzymes, but for most other reactions in the central catabolic pathways, again
supported by well-studied enzymes from model organisms, but adapted to own
speciﬁc needs. Remarkably, those accessory catabolic enzymes are not unique for
anammox bacteria and N-DAMO. Close homologs are found in protein databases
where those homologs derive from (partly) known, but in most cases unknown
species that together comprise an only poorly comprehended microbial world.

Introduction
Ammonia and methane are rather inert molecules, which is due to the high bond
dissociation energy of the N-H (~400 kJ · mole1) and C-H (429 kJ · mole1) bonds.
Aerobic ammonium-oxidizing and methane-oxidizing microorganisms are able
to break up these bonds using the oxidative power of oxygen. By the action of
two evolutionary highly related membrane-bound iron/copper enzymes, ammonia
monooxygenase (AMO) and particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), ammo-
nia and methane are activated to more accessible hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and
methanol (CH3OH), respectively [1–3]. Besides pMMO, aerobic methane-oxidizing
bacteria, the methanotrophs, can dispose of the unrelated soluble iron-only methane
monooxygenase (sMMO) for methane activation (see Chapter 6 of this volume).
Aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and aerobic methanotrophs have been
investigated for more than a century. All species studied until lately were members of
the domain of Bacteria, but also ammonium-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) are known by
now [4]. Although AOA typically thrive at very low oxygen concentrations, they too
depend on oxygen to convert ammonium into hydroxylamine [5, 6].
The common notion that oxygen would be indispensable for ammonium and
methane conversion may have blindfolded the search for microorganisms that
would make a living of the oxidation of these substrates with electron acceptors
other than O2. Today we know that these “impossible” microorganisms do exist and
in this chapter we will go into the biochemical basis of two groups of bacteria that
drive ammonium and methane conversion with nitrite as the oxidant: The anaerobic
ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and the nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic
methane oxidizers (N-DAMO). Characteristics of these organisms are extreme slow
growth rates, and the requirement of dedicated enrichment techniques and molecular
detection tools [7, 8], factors that may have impeded an earlier identiﬁcation.
Anammox bacteria have been ﬁrst described only 20 years ago [9]. The active
search for these organisms was spurred by the observation that ammonium
disappeared in laboratory wastewater treatment reactors in the apparent absence
of O2 and as the result of a biological agent [9]. Following their ﬁrst enrichment
[10], anammox bacteria have been detected in a multitude of species and subspecies
by now [11, 12]. They have been found worldwide and occur in essentially each
anaerobic environment where ﬁxed nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite) is lost as
dinitrogen gas (N2). In many of these ecosystems, anammox bacteria play a key role
in nitrogen cycle processes. Apart from their biogeochemical relevance, anammox
bacteria offer us an economically attractive and environmentally friendly alterna-
tive to current wastewater treatment technology [13].
Anaerobic oxidation of methane is performed by two completely different
groups of microorganisms: Archaea and members of the NC10 phylum of Bacteria.
Archaeal methane oxidizers are found in deep-sea methane seeps where they
couple, either or not in symbiotic interaction, methane oxidation with the reduction
of sulfate [14]. Next to this, an archaeal enrichment culture designated Candidatus
‘Methanoperedens nitroreducens’ was recently described that was able of methane

oxidation at the expense of nitrate [15]. Intriguingly, the process took place in
concurrence with anammox bacteria. Even so intriguingly, the original NC10
enrichment culture grown on methane and nitrate harbored a signiﬁcant population
of Archaea that phylogenetically afﬁliated those of the sulfate- and nitrate-reducing
systems [16]. The archaeal species disappeared completely when the NC10 culture
was shifted from nitrate to nitrite [17]. Although many details still have to be
resolved, it seems clear that methane oxidation by Archaea is achieved by the
reversal of the methane formation pathway [14], which is described in Chapter 6 of
Vol. 14 of this series [138]. NC10 bacteria, represented by Candidatus
‘Methanomirabilis oxyfera’ [18], employ another strategy to tackle methane.
These bacteria produce oxygen themselves, allowing the monooxygenation of
methane into methanol that is subsequently oxidized to CO2, as is carried out by
aerobic methanotrophs [19].
Considering the inert nature of ammonium and methane, the primary question
was how both substrates are activated by anammox and N-DAMO bacteria with
nitrite (or nitrate) as oxidant. Whereas we are only at the beginning of a fundamen-
tal understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anammox and
N-DAMO processes, it has become clear that these microorganisms evolved
novel biochemical systems to catalyze these reactions. This biochemistry is fully
metal ion-based. However, not only the speciﬁc activation reactions are supported
by metal chemistry. Most of the other pathway key reactions rely, in some way or
another, on metal ions (Figure 1 in Section 2.1 and Figure 2 in Section 2.2). Here,
anammox and N-DAMO bacteria take advantage of enzyme systems already
known from other organisms, which have been adapted to own metabolic require-
ments by subtle structural modiﬁcations.

Pathways of Nitrite-Driven Anaerobic Oxidation
of Ammonium and Methane
Anammox bacteria are autotrophic microorganisms, i.e., they are able to use CO2 as
the sole carbon source [10]. The energy for growth is obtained from the oxidation of
ammonium with nitrite at which N2 is produced as the end product (eq. 1). Princi-
pally, also ammonium oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction would provide sufﬁ-
cient energy to sustain growth (eq. 2), but this process does not comply with the
biochemistry as far as we know it and highly enriched laboratory cultures are
obtained only with nitrite.

Like anammox bacteria, M. oxyfera is an autotroph. With methane as electron
donor, nitrite is reduced in catabolism to N2, as in anammox bacteria (eq. 3).
Theoretically, nitrate might act as an electron acceptor (eq. 4), but its use resists a
proper redox balance (see Section 2.2). In laboratory practice, enrichment of
M. oxyfera is only achieved with nitrite [17, 18].
Before discussing the individual biochemical reactions, we will ﬁrst give an
overview of how these steps are connected in the central catabolic pathways of the
anammox and N-DAMO bacteria.
2.1
The Anammox Pathway
The crucial question at the start of anammox biochemistry was how ammonium
could be activated in the apparent absence of oxygen. The clue to its understand-
ing came from the fortuitous observation that metabolism by whole cells of
ammonium and hydroxylamine, an artiﬁcial substrate, was accompanied by the
transient accumulation of hydrazine (N2H4) [20]. Subsequent whole cell and
biochemical studies established the role of hydrazine as an intermediate, also
under physiological conditions [21, 22]. These studies identiﬁed a second inter-
mediate proposed earlier, NO [21], while their results disfavored a role as such of
hydroxylamine, as postulated initially [20]. Our current understanding is that
anammox catabolism essentially is comprised of three consecutive reactions
with two intermediates: (1) the one-electron reduction of nitrite to NO catalyzed
by a nitrite reductase (Nir), (2) the condensation of ammonium and NO together
with the input of three electrons leading to hydrazine, and (3) the oxidation of
hydrazine to N2, which generates four electrons that drive steps (1) and (2) in a
cyclic way (Figure 1).
In this scheme (Figure 1), hydrazine synthesis would be catalyzed by a biochem-
ical novelty, hydrazine synthase (HZS) [21]. Hydrazine oxidation would be brought
about by hydrazine dehydrogenase/oxidase (HDH/HZO) representing a speciﬁc
variant of the octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), a key enzyme in
AOB (see Section 3.3.1). These expectations have been conﬁrmed by the isolation
and (initial) characterization of anammox enzymes [22]. Anammox metabolism as
depicted in Figure 1 proceeds with a cyclic electron ﬂow. This cyclic ﬂow would take
place such that oxidation and reduction reactions performed by membrane-bound
7

processes are connected with the pumping of protons across these membranes, thus
sustaining a proton-motive force to drive ATP synthesis. In anammox bacteria,
respiratory processes would reside at a large intracellular cell organelle, termed the
anammoxosome [23]. Present evidence supports such chemiosmotic mechanism in
all major respects. Moreover, ongoing research underpins the central role of the
anammoxosome in energy metabolism [24]. However, the detailed discussion of
anammox energy metabolism is out of scope of the present chapter and we would
like to refer interested readers to recent reviews that have been published on this
matter [25, 26].
Reductive catabolic reactions in CO2 ﬁxation draw from the cyclic electron
ﬂow and electrons have to be replenished. The longstanding observation that
autotrophic growth of anammox bacteria is always associated with the oxidation
of nitrite to nitrate indicates that the electrons derive from nitrite [7]. The question
how these electrons enter the cycle has not been resolved, considering that nitrite

transfer processes within the cell are represented by black diamonds. Proton-motive force-driven
ATP synthesis is schematically shown by proton translocation towards the positive (p-) side of the
membrane system and ATP generation at the negative (n-) side. The p- and n-sides are the
anammoxosome intracellular organelle and the cell cytoplasm, respectively. Electrons used for
biosynthetic reduction reactions are replenished to the anammox cyclic electron ﬂow by the
oxidation of nitrite (dashed lines). “Disguised denitriﬁcation” by the reduction of nitrate or nitrite

is a relative poor electron donor (E00 NO
3 /NO
2 ¼ + 0.43 V). Nevertheless,
anammox cells contain high amounts of the iron-molybdoprotein nitrite:nitrate
oxidoreductase (NXR), which is related to nitrate reductase found in denitriﬁers
(see Section 3.4.1). Indeed, NXR is capable of nitrate reduction [27] implying that
anammox bacteria also use nitrate as terminal electron acceptor (eq. 2). Under
chemolithoautotrophic conditions, i.e., with ammonium as the only electron
donor, this is impossible. The reason for this is that in order to be reduced to
nitrite, nitrate reduction needs electrons that drain the cyclic electron ﬂow without
replenishment. However, when grown in the presence of one of many different
external inorganic or organic electron donors nitrate can be reduced to nitrite to
support the anammox process (Figure 1) [28]. Under such conditions anammox
bacteria may present themselves “disguised” as denitriﬁers [28]. Now, half of the
nitrite formed from nitrate is reduced to ammonia, which combines with the other
half of nitrite in the anammox process. The apparent result is the complete
reduction of nitrate into N2, as is done by true denitriﬁers. The reduction of nitrite
into ammonia requires an ammonium-forming nitrite reductase as described in
Chapter 9 of ref. [138]. The nature of this nitrite reductase in anammox bacteria
will be the topic of Section 3.4.2.
2.2
The Pathway of Nitrite-Driven Methane Oxidation
An answer how M. oxyfera could couple the anaerobic oxidation of methane with
the reduction to nitrite to produce CO2 and N2 (eq. 3) came from genome sequenc-
ing, whole-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, and complementary phys-
iological experiments using stable isotopes [18]. Initially, genome sequencing
results were puzzling. M. oxyfera lacks the N2-forming key enzyme in the denitri-
ﬁcation pathway, nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase (N2OR) (see Chapter 8 of ref.
[138]). At the same time, the full complement of the aerobic methane oxidation
pathway was present in the genome of M. oxyfera. These contradictory ﬁndings
could be resolved by the observation that the organism produced oxygen derived
from nitrite during its metabolism [18]. The metabolic model that is consistent with
all ﬁndings thus far is shown in Figure 2.
The central proposition of the model is that M. oxyfera harbors a nitric oxide
reductase- (NOR) like enzyme that does not reduce NO into N2O, as common
NORs do (see Chapter 4), but that disproportionates NO into N2 and O2. The nature
of this NO dismutase (NOD) and other NOR-like proteins found in the genome of
M. oxyfera is the subject of Sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.4. The production of O2
serves the activation of methane into methanol that is oxidized to CO2 thereby
generating the electrons for methane monooxygenation and nitrite reduction (Sec-
tion 4.2). One may note from Figure 2 that the substrate and electron ﬂows are not
balanced. The conversion of 8 molecules of nitrite requires the input of eight
7
Anaerobic Oxidation of Ammonium and Methane
263

electrons, at which four O2 and four N2 molecules are produced. Three O2 molecules
are required for methane activation, whilst a net 12 electrons are released in the
oxidation pathway. The residual O2 molecule and four electrons are respired into
water [29]. By the same argumentation it is seen that nitrate-dependent methane
oxidation by M. oxyfera alone (eq. 4) is not feasible for two reasons. At one hand, the
conversion of eight molecules of NO
3 would generate only four O2 molecules, which
does not sustain the monoxygenation of ﬁve CH4 molecules. On the other hand, the
oxidation of ﬁve molecules of methane generates an insufﬁcient amount of electrons
(20) for the reduction of eight molecules of nitrate into NO (24). Therefore,
M. oxyfera has to rely on a (methane-oxidizing) nitrate-reducing partner that supplies
N-DAMO with a certain amount of nitrite (or electron donor) to balance its substrate
and electron ﬂows. In the original N-DAMO enrichment culture on methane and
nitrate [16] mentioned in the Introduction, this nitrite might have been supplied by the
archaeal members of the culture.

The genome of Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, the organism that has been used for most
studies, contains a gene cluster (kuste4136-4140) encoding the full complement of a
functional NirS [21, 22]. In the kuste4136 gene product all structural and functional
amino acids are completely conserved with respect to NirS having a known crystal
structure [31]. Kust4137 codes for a c-type heme (NirC) that might act as the
one-electron shuttle in nitrite reduction. The gene products of kuste4138-4140
share signiﬁcant sequence identities with NirN, NirJ, and NirF, respectively, known
to be involved in the assembly of the heme d prosthetic group and further maturation
of NirS [32]. However, NirS (kuste4136) and NirC (kuste4137) seem to be hardly
expressed in the transcriptome and the whole-cell proteome [21, 22]. In striking
contrast, NirS is among the highest expressed proteins in the marine anammox
species Scalindua profunda [33]. Unlike the two species mentioned, anammox strain
KSU-1 [34] and Jettenia asiatica [35] lack cyt cd1 nitrite reductase, but they encode
and express the copper-containing NirK. More surprising is the absence of both NirS
and NirK in the genomes of Brocadia species ([36]; M. Oshiki and D. Speth, personal
communication), even though cell free systems of Brocadia sinica display nitrite-
reducing and NO-producing activity that easily supports metabolic requirements.
Thus, Brocadia and possibly also other anammox species must have a nitrite reduc-
tase different from known NirS and NirK.
3.2
Hydrazine Synthesis
Hydrazine synthesis is the exemplary invention of anammox bacteria. The presence
of hydrazine synthase enables anammox bacteria to convert ammonium anaerobi-
cally, thus providing for these organisms a speciﬁc and important niche in microbial
ecosystems. Besides this, hydrazine synthase is the second enzyme, next to NOR
(see Chapter 4 of this Volume), that is able to forge an N-N bond. Direct puriﬁca-
tion from K. stuttgartiensis identiﬁed HZS as the heterotrimeric gene products of
kuste2859-2861 [22], as predicted before [21]. In this organism, HZS comprises no
less than ~20 % of the cellular proteins. The kuste2859-2861 genes form part of a
larger gene cluster (kuste2854-2861) of which the other genes may encode addi-
tional protein components that are needed for HZS expression and activity (Fig-
ure 3a). Kuste2857 that codes for a sigma 54-type transcriptional regulator is
conspicuous in the expression regulation respect.
HZS catalyzes hydrazine synthesis from ammonium (or ammonia) and NO with
the input of three electrons (eq. 6). Experiments with puriﬁed enzyme conﬁrmed
this
reaction
[22].

the HAO-like proteins (kustc1061) described next to artiﬁcially pull the reaction by
removing the product (hydrazine) and push it by providing electrons via bovine
heart cytochrome c. Still, in vitro rates were only about 1 % of in vivo rates. This
loss in activity was already obtained by merely breaking the cells, indicating the
disruption of a tightly coupled enzyme system and the requirement of other
physiological relevant electron and substrate carriers. Nevertheless, HZS would
be a very slow enzyme, also when fully active, possibly explaining the slow growth
rate of anammox bacteria.

(34 nmol · min1 · mg1; eq. 8) with rates that are one to ﬁve orders of magnitude
higher than physiological hydrazine synthesis. At this stage, our understanding of
the molecular mechanism underlying hydrazine synthesis is hidden in a cloud of
questions. The initial biochemical characterization of the enzyme [22] and struc-
tural properties predicted from the kuste2859-2861 gene products [12, 26] might
allow a ﬁrst glance into this cloud (Figure 3b).
All three kuste2859-2861 genes are preceded by N-terminal signal sequences
and lack any other coding sequences for transmembrane helices (TMHs), indicating
the export of processed proteins across a cell membrane. In agreement herewith,
antibodies raised against speciﬁc peptides localize HZS exclusively in the
anammoxosome [24]. Sequence analysis suggests kuste2859 to be composed
entirely of β propeller strands. In S. profunda, the kuste2859 and kuste2860
homologs are fused (scal00025) [33]. Also kuste2861 consists mainly of β propeller
sheets, notably in its N-terminal part. In its C-terminus, two heme c binding motifs
(CXXCH) are present. Kuste2860 contains two heme c binding motifs as well and
sequence comparison afﬁliates this protein with two well-characterized enzymes
with completely different functions: Cytochrome c peroxidase [37] and the MauG
protein [38]. Cytochrome c peroxidase mediates the reduction of hydrogen perox-
ide; MauG catalyzes the intricate insertion of oxygen atoms into a precursor of
tryptophan tryptophylquinone, the cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. Cyt
c peroxidase and MauG harbor two c-type hemes each, one low-spin heme acting in
electron transfer and one high-spin heme representing the catalytic center. These
high-spin hemes are known to bind NO [39]. By homology, kuste2860 is inferred to
be an NO-binding catalytic subunit. Binding of NO together with the addition of
three electrons as proposed in Figure 3, would reduce NO to hydroxylamine
(reversed reaction 7). The observed hydroxylamine oxidizing activity of HZS is
consistent with this proposal. Next, the condensation of NH2OH and ammonia
together with the withdrawal of water would produce hydrazine (eq. 9). Although
hydrazine synthesis in this way is exergonic per se, it will not be an easy reaction,
taking into account the high dissociation energy of the N-H bond. To overcome the
energy barrier, one might envisage the presence in HZS of a second catalytic site in
which a strong oxidizing group binds ammonia to weaken the N-H bonds.
As a part of the kuste2854-2861 gene cluster, kuste2854 encodes an exported
soluble triheme cyt c protein, which would make it an excellent three-electron
carrier in hydrazine synthesis (Figure 3b) [26]. Kuste2855 codes for a protein with
seven c-type hemes that, after export out of cytoplasm remains bound to the

NeHAO (c) harbors an additional tyrosine (Y358) near the active site that is replaced at this

(anammoxosome) membrane by one TMH in its C-terminus. The membrane-bound
kuste2856 shares signiﬁcant sequence identity to the heme b-containing γ subunit
(FdnI, cyt b556) of menaquinone (MQ)-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH-N,
FdnGHI) [26]. Sequence identity includes the conservation of the topology of the
TMHs and of amino acids that are involved in binding of the two heme b groups and
of menaquinone in the FDH-N crystal structure [40]. Herewith, kuste2855, perhaps
in concert with kust2856, could act as a quinol:cyt c oxidoreductase at which the
soluble kuste2854 shuttles the electrons to HZS (Figure 3b). The absence of this
membrane system in experiments with puriﬁed HZS could be an explanation for its
observed low activity [26].

Anammox and Its Multiple Hydroxylamine
Oxidoreductase-Like Proteins
3.3.1
A Collection of Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase-Like Proteins
The identiﬁcation of hydrazine as an intermediate in the anammox process imme-
diately suggested a candidate enzyme that could oxidize the compound into N2
(eq. 8) [21]. It has been known for a long time that hydrazine can be oxidized
efﬁciently by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) from aerobic ammonium
oxidizers [41]. In these organisms, the physiological reaction of HAO is the four-
electron oxidation of hydroxylamine into the endproduct nitrite (eq. 10) [42].

HAO from Nitrosomonas europaea (NeHAO) has been well characterized over
many years and its crystal structure is known [43, 44]. NeHAO is a homotrimeric
protein in which each subunit binds eight c-type hemes (Figure 4a). Seven of these
hemes are low-spin by proximal and distal histidine ligations. Together, they represent
an electron-wiring circuit to the subunit’s exit and to a next subunit. The catalytic
center is heme-4 that binds and converts hydroxylamine at the distal position
(Figure 4c). A remarkable property of NeHAO is the presence of two covalent

dehydrogenase/oxidase (HDH/HZO) octaheme proteins from K. stuttgartiensis (kustc0694,

the typical CX4CH heme-3 binding motif in the HDHs (top), the active site tyrosine in NeHAO
that is replaced by a methionine by a two-amino acid contraction in the anammox proteins
(middle), and the conserved tyrosine that is covalently bound to the catalytic heme-4 in these
octaheme proteins (bottom). Structural ﬁgures were prepared in PyMOL [48] using the following
protein database (PDB ID) ﬁles: (a) 4N4N, (b) 4N4J, (c) 4N4O, (d) 4N4K, and (e) 4N4L [44].

bonds between a tyrosine from the next subunit and the active-site heme-4,
constituting the P460 prosthetic group. The group is named after its speciﬁc absorption
maximum around 460 nm in the fully reduced protein. Through these bonds, all three
subunits are covalently linked as a 200 kDa complex. For as-yet not fully understood
reasons, the P460-type heme favors substrate oxidation reactions [45]. In contrast, other
related multiheme proteins that lack the tyrosine heme-4 crosslink are equipped for
reductive substrate conversions.
Rather than one, no less than ten different HAO paralogs are detected in the
genome of K. stuttgartiensis, six of which being highly expressed at the
transcriptome and proteome levels (Figure 5) [21, 22]. The collection of
HAO-like proteins is highly conserved in other genomes of anammox bacteria as
well. The straightforward questions then were, which one(s) would be the physio-
logical hydrazine dehydrogenase(s), what would the others do, and how would the
different HAO paralogs be tuned to a presumably speciﬁc function? Sequence
comparison and phylogenetic analysis allow their classiﬁcation into a number of
subgroups (Figure 5) [12, 26, 45]. Four of the proteins (kustc0694, kustd1340,
kustc1061, and kusta0043) possess the tyrosine in their C-terminus that makes the
covalent bonding in HAO. Six of these lack the particular tyrosine, at which
kustc0458, kuste4574, and kuste2479 cluster as one subgroup sharing ~50 %
sequence identity to each other. The residual three, lowly expressed ones
(kustd2021, kuste2435, and kuste2457) display less than 30 % sequence identities,
both to each other and to the seven ones already mentioned. Direct evidence for the
function of some HAO-like paralogs has come from direct puriﬁcation and subse-
quent characterization.
3.3.2
Hydroxylamine Oxidation to Nitric Oxide
The best understood HAO-like protein from anammox bacteria, both regarding its
structure and function, is kustc1061 from K. stuttgartiensis [44]. The protein has
also been puriﬁed from anammox strain KSU-1 [46] and from Brocadia
anammoxidans [47]. In agreement with what is seen in its protein sequence
(Figure 5), kustc1061 is an octaheme protein in which the (three) subunits are
covalently bound via the conserved tyrosine to the catalytic heme-4, like in NeHAO
[44]. Despite an only 30 % sequence identity, kustc1061 and NeHAO share a highly
similar overall architecture (Figure 4). The similarity encompasses the spatial
position and orientation of the eight heme groups, and the structure of the P460
catalytic heme-4. Such heme arrangement was also found in other multiheme
proteins, like cyt c nitrite reductase (see Chapter 9 of ref. [138]). Still, there appears
to be one signiﬁcant difference between kustc1061 and NeHAO, which affects the
functionality of both enzymes. NeHAO contains a speciﬁc tyrosine near the cata-
lytic site, which is absent in kustc1061 (Figures 4c and d).
Both kustc1061 and NeHAO catalyze the oxidation of hydroxylamine,
but with different outcomes. While kustc1061 produces NO in a three-electron
270
Reimann, Jetten, and Keltjens

oxidation (eq. 7), the reaction product of NeHAO is nitrite (eq. 10). Hydroxylamine
reacts spontaneously with as-isolated fully oxidized kustc1061, at which the
enzyme undergoes a two-electron reduction and hydroxylamine gets oxidized to
the HNO nitrosyl state. In crystals both of kustc1061 and HAO soaked with
hydroxylamine, the nitrosyl is bound to the iron of the P460 catalytic heme [44]
(Figures 4c and d). The subsequent one-electron oxidation of HNO yields NO,
which is released in case of kustc1061. The sequence of events suggests the
catalytic mechanism shown in Figure 6. In the reaction catalyzed by NeHAO, a
water molecule has to be added to NO to produce nitrite after one more one-electron
oxidation. The tyrosine next to the NeHAO catalytic site, which is absent in
kustc1061, is perfectly positioned to mediate such water addition [44].

Besides hydroxylamine conversion, kustc1061 catalyzes the four-electron oxi-
dation of hydrazine (eq. 8), albeit with 50-fold lower catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km)
[44]. Analogously to hydroxylamine, hydrazine added to the oxidized protein
results in a diazene-like (NH¼NH) molecule bound to the P460 iron [44]
(Figure 4e). Even though hydrazine is not the physiological substrate of
kustc1061, this observation might be of relevance in understanding the function
of the genuine hydrazine dehydrogenase described in the next section.
It is understood by now that hydroxylamine is not an intermediate and the
function of kustc1061 as a speciﬁc hydroxylamine oxidase is not easy to reconcile
with anammox central metabolism as we know it. However, hydroxylamine could
be an intermediate in hydrazine synthesis (see previous Section 3.2; Figure 3) and,
as suggested before [26], failure to complete the difﬁcult condensation reaction
with ammonia might result in the spillage of hydroxylamine. Now, kustc1061
would expertly serve the regeneration of NO and three electrons for a next synthesis
attempt. In this respect, it may be interesting to note that kustc1061 homologs in
other anammox genomes are clustered with the HZS system [33–36].

therein) assisted by a speciﬁc tyrosine near the HAO active site for the addition of water.

3.3.3
Hydrazine Oxidation and Nitrogen Formation
Direct puriﬁcation from K. stuttgartiensis identiﬁed the genuine N2-forming hydra-
zine dehydrogenase/oxidase (HDH/HZO) as kustc0694 [22]. The homologous
enzyme from anammox strain KSU-1 had been described before [50], but its function
was not fully assured by then. Kustc0694 is a member of the HAO-like family
introduced above (Figure 5). The puriﬁed protein is 100 amino acids shorter than
annotated in the genome database because of an incorrect assignment of the start
codon and N-terminal signal peptide cleavage [22]. This cleavage is most likely
associated with the export of kustc0694 into the anammoxosome [24]. Kustc0694 is
over 95 % identical, both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, to kustd1340, most
likely representing a second HDH in K. stuttgartiensis and other anammox species.
Like kustc1061 and NeHAO, kustc0694 is a homotrimeric protein carrying eight
c-type hemes per subunit and the three subunits are covalently linked to each other
[22, 50]. A peculiar feature of kustc0694 and its close homologs is the divergent
CX4CH binding motif for heme-3 (Figures 4f and 5). The rational for this is not
understood. The increase in length between both cysteines that bind the heme c most
likely affects the position of this heme with respect to neighboring hemes, in its turn
affecting electron transfer between the hemes. Upon reduction of the oxidized
protein, the characteristic P460 absorption maximum is observed [50]. This observa-
tion, the covalent binding of the subunits, and the presence in the kustc0694
sequence of the tyrosine that makes two bonds to heme-4 in kustc1061 and NeHAO
(Figure 4) are highly suggestive that heme-4 is the catalytic site also in kustc0694.
Kustc0694 catalyzes with high Vmax and low Km the four-electron oxidation of
hydrazine to N2 according to equation 8 [22]. Hydroxylamine is not a substrate, but
rather a strong competitive inhibitor with respect to hydrazine. Also NO, a free
intermediate in anammox metabolism, competitively inhibits hydrazine oxidation
withlowKi.Incubationofkustc1061withhydrazineresultsinthetwo-electron-oxidized
diazene bound to the P460 heme (Figure 4e). Although this remains to be shown, the
samecouldholdforkustc0694.Thesubsequenttwo-electronoxidationofdiazenewould
then make N2. The passage of two times two electrons through an electron wire
composed of a series of one-electron (heme) carriers will need a ﬁne-timing of the
electron circuit. Similarly, the P460 catalytic center has to be ﬁne-tuned for hydrazine
turnover. How these aspects are resolved is a matter of ongoing research, which will
include the resolution of the kustc0694 crystal structure. Future investigations have to
address one more important issue, namely how the low-redox potential electrons
derived from hydrazine oxidation (eq. 8) are utilized to build up a proton-motive force.
3.3.4
What About the Other Hydroxylamine
Oxidoreductase-Like Proteins?
Kustc0458, kuste4574, and kuste2479 share signiﬁcant sequence identities,
especially regarding the presence and the position in their protein sequences of
eight c-type hemes (Figure 5). This might suggest that these three proteins have a
7
Anaerobic Oxidation of Ammonium and Methane

similar function. All three lack the tyrosine in the C-terminus, which is responsible
for the binding with a catalytic heme, indicative of reductive transformations [45].
Kustc0458 has been puriﬁed from K. stuttgartiensis and its crystal structure has
been resolved as a heterododecameric (α6β6) complex composed of a dimer of
kustc0458 octaheme trimers at which each kustc0458 subunit is associated with the
diheme kustc0457 [51]. Altogether, the complex harbors no less than sixty c-type
hemes. Again, the catalytic center is heme-4, but this heme is not covalently bound
to a next subunit. Correspondingly, the kustc0457-0458 complex does not catalyze
the oxidation of nitrogenous substrates and the only activity that could be measured
was the reduction of nitrite, presumably to ammonium [51]. However, this activity
was obtained with reduced methyl viologen as a powerful reductant. Since reduced
viologen dyes also support reductive reactions by NeHAO [52] and kustc1061 [44]
artiﬁcially, the question remains if nitrite reduction to ammonium represents the
physiological reaction of kustc0457-0458. An answer to this question may be found
by the isolation and identiﬁcation of the physiological electron carrier of the
complex. Here, an attractive candidate would be the gene product that is directly
linked to the kustc0457 and kustc0458 genes, namely kustc0456. Sequence
analysis identiﬁes kustc0456 as a novel type-1 copper-containing cupredoxin
[26]. Cupredoxins serve as electron carriers in many respiratory and photosynthetic
systems [53], including NO-forming nitrite reductase NirS [54].
Kustc0458 shows 47 % sequence identity to kuste4574 (Figure 5). The identity
comprises the conservation in the alignment of the eight heme-c binding sites
including six or seven histidines that make up the distal ligands to the electron-
wiring c-type hemes, leaving heme-4 as the catalytic site also in kuste4574. As
already mentioned, kuste4574 lacks the tyrosine that is involved in the covalent
bonding of heme-4 in NeHAO, kustc0694, and kustc1061, indicative of a reductive
catalysis. Importantly, kuste4574 forms part of a gene cluster (kuste4569-74) that
codes for one of three bc1 complexes in K. stuttgartiensis (Figure 7) and this bc1
complex could be most remarkable by its composition.
Like canonical bc1/b6f complexes, the kuste4569-74 genes code for a 2Fe-2S
Rieske subunit (kuste4569), a heme b- and quinone-binding part (kustc4571-72)
and a c-type heme (kuste4573). However, detailed sequence analyses afﬁliate this
anammox system, as well as the alternative system encoded by kustd1480-85, with
a novel type of bc complexes [55, 56]. The Rieske subunit could have aberrant
redox properties [55], the heme b- and quinone-binding part is split across two
proteins similar to photosynthetic b6f systems, and the c-type heme is a hexaheme
protein. Besides HAO-like kuste4574, kuste4569-74 gene cluster codes for one
more polypeptide, an FAD-binding NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (kuste4570). If
assembled as one whole, the question is what the complex would do, and an answer
can only be a speculative one: The simultaneous coupling by a bifurcation
mechanism of (mena)quinol oxidation to the reduction of both a nitrogenous
substrate and NAD(P)+ [26]. If the reduction encompasses the conversion of nitrite
into NO, this would answer two open issues at the same time, the nature of
the elusive nitrite reductase and the way NAD(P)H is generated for biosynthetic
purposes.
274
Reimann, Jetten, and Keltjens

Kuste2479 is another interesting HAO-like protein that is well conserved amongst
anammox bacteria. While its C-terminal part with its eight c-type hemes shows
signiﬁcant (>50 %) sequence identity to kustc0458 and kuste4574, the N-terminal
sequence is comprised of a leader sequence for protein export and an amino acid
sequence that maps to the broad family of copper-containing laccases [58], and to
two-domain small laccases more speciﬁcally [59]. The neighboring gene kuste2479
codes for a diheme protein in the N-terminus and a linocyn in the C-terminus.
Linocyns assemble into isohedral nanocompartments that enclose oxidative-stress
response proteins [60]. After export out of the cell, the assembly might act in the
removal of reactive oxygen or nitrosative species. The presence and identiﬁcation of
such nanobodies in anammox cultures remains to be established, which will not be an
easy task since kuste2479 and kuste2478 are only lowly expressed.

Figure 7 Gene cluster organization (a) and possible functional organization of its gene products
(b) of a novel cytochrome bc complex found in anammox bacteria. The complex consists of
Rieske-type 2Fe2S iron sulfur protein, a membrane-bound heme b part split across two proteins
and a c-type cytochrome [12, 26] together with a HAO-like octaheme protein and a FAD-dependent
NAD(P)H oxidoreductase. Heme b- and quinone (Q)-binding sites were inferred from the
conservation of amino acids in crystal structures of bc1 and b6f complexes implicated in the binding
of these compounds [57]. The anammox bc complex has been suggested to couple menaquinol
oxidation to the reduction of nitrite and NAD(P)+ by a bifurcation mechanism [26]. Numbers in

3.4
The Oxidation of Nitrite and Reduction of Nitrate
3.4.1
The Nitrite:Nitrate Oxidoreductase System
In anammox metabolism, the nitrite:nitrate oxidoreductase (NXR) serves two
opposite goals, (1) the oxidation of nitrite to replenish the cyclic electron ﬂow
upon draining due to the loss of intermediates (NO, hydrazine) or electrons for
biosynthetic activities, and (2) the reduction of nitrate to nitrite during growth in the
presence of external electron donors other than ammonium (eq. 11) (Figure 1). In
K. stuttgartiensis, structural genes (NxrABC) coding for the NXR protein form part
of a large gene cluster (kustd1699-1713), which is highly conserved among
anammox genomes.

The cluster encodes an astonishing range of metal-containing proteins (Fig-
ure 8a). The NxrABC structural genes are represented by kustd1700, kustd1703,
and kustd1704, respectively. Herein, kustd1700 codes for a protein (1148 amino
acids) that is preceded by a twin-arginine translocation (tat) signal for protein
export and that belongs to the broad class of molybdopterin (MPT) enzymes.
Members of this class catalyze a variety of oxidation and reduction reactions of
N-, S- or carbon-substrates (see [61] for a review). Amongst many others, the
family includes nitrate reductase (NarGHI), formate dehydrogenase (see Sec-
tion 4.2.4), acetylene hydratase (see Chapter 2 of ref. [138]), and dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) reductase and dimethylsulﬁde dehydrogenase (see Chapter 11 of ref.
[138]). Quite a few MPT proteins have been well characterized by the resolution
of their atomic structures [61]. Their common property is the presence of a catalytic
molybdenum atom that is coordinated by four sulfur atoms derived from two
antiparallel-oriented dithiolene-containing pterins that are esteriﬁed with guanine
dinucleotide (Mo-bisPGD) (Figure 8b). The pterin occurs in two conformers, as a
tricyclic
(pyranopterin)
and
a
bicyclic
structure
with
an
open
furan
(molybdopterin). A ﬁfth ligand to molybdenum is provided by a serine, cysteine,
selenocysteine, or a mono-/bidentate oxo/hydroxyl group (D222 in NarG) [62]. In
the N-terminal part, a conserved set of cysteines is usually present to bind a 4Fe4S
cluster (FS0). While sequence analysis unambiguously identiﬁes kustc1700 as a
molybdopterin protein, sequence identity with MPT enzymes of known function,
including NarG nitrate reductase, is moderate (10–25 %). By and large, kustd1700
harbors the series of amino acids that have been identiﬁed in other MPT proteins
with the binding of the Mo-bisPGD cofactors, but the full conservation with any
known protein is not seen. This would imply that Mo and its cofactors are bound
such as to facilitate its speciﬁc catalytic function, the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate.
In agreement herewith, sequence identity is highest (~60 %) with putative Nxr
genes found in the genomes of the nitrite oxidizers Candidatus ‘Nitrospira deﬂuvii’
[63] and Nitrospina gracilis [64]. Despite the overall divergence, kustd1700

the gene identiﬁers (kustd) of Kuenenia stuttgartiensis; gene lengths and the position of structural
motifs in (a) are drawn to scale (bp, base pairs). Structural motifs are speciﬁed in the ﬁgure. The
system is suggested to be comprised of the catalytic NxrABC protein, membrane-bound protein
complexes, including a protein (kustd1712) partly related to subunit I (cydA) of the cytochrome bd
quinol oxidase (CydAB) [71] and several heme-c type as well as novel cupredoxin-type [26]
soluble electron carriers. NxrA houses a Mo-bis(pyrano guanine dinucleotide) cofactor common to
all molybdopterin enzymes of which the chemical structure is shown in (b). In this structure the
open furan form of the pterin moiety is displayed above and the tricyclic pterin below the
molybdenum that is coordinated by the dithiolene groups; G, guanine monophosphate. Putative
heme b- and quinone (Q)-binding sites were inferred from the CydAB sequence [71]. Abbrevia-

contains the aspartate (D222) that binds Mo in NarG. Also the set of FS0-binding
cysteines is found, albeit with one remarkable difference. In NarG the iron sulfur
cluster is coordinated by a HX3CX3CX34C sequence [62, 65], whereas a
CX3DX3CX39C sequence is found at this position in kustd1700 and homologous
nitriﬁer sequences. The difference in coordination likely will affect the redox
potential of the FS0 iron-sulfur cluster in its role to transfer electrons to or from
the molybdopterin catalytic site.
Like in many MPT proteins [61], electron transfer encompasses a second subunit
(NxrB, kustd1704) that contains the conserved set of cysteines to accommodate
4 additional iron sulfur clusters (FS1-4), in which FS1-3 represent 4Fe4S clusters
and FS4 is a 3Fe4S moiety. Unlike archetypal MPT proteins [61], the third subunit
(NxrC, kustd1704) is not a membrane anchor. Rather, kustd1704 is a soluble
protein with an N-terminal signal sequence for protein export (Figure 8). Impor-
tantly, NxrC shares highest sequence identity with the heme b-containing C sub-
units of a subset of MPT proteins, as there are dimethylsulﬁde dehydrogenase [66],
selenate reductase [67], chlorate reductase [68], and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase
[69]. Sequence identity includes the amino acids that coordinate heme b in the
crystal structure of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase [69].
Besides the three structural subunits, the kustd1699-1713 gene cluster encodes a
series of other proteins that apparently play a role in the functioning of the NXR
system. The gene product of kustd1702 is related to the NarJ and TorD proteins that
act as chaperones in MPT protein maturation [70]. A chaperone role is also
anticipated
for

(UspA)-related
kustd1706.
Kustd1701 is characterized by four C-terminal cysteines with the typical spacing
of adrenodoxin/putidaredoxin-like 2Fe2S clusters. Kustd1707, kustd1710, and
kustd1709 have one or more TMHs at which the former two carry one c-type
heme each with an orientation as proposed in Figure 8c. Kustd1709 is remarkable
by its fusion of heme b-containing kustd1704 and kustc0457, found as the diheme
subunit of the kustc0457-0458 complex described above (see Section 3.3.4). It is
conceivable that these three membrane-associated proteins form a complex, possi-
bly associated with one or more of the remaining polypeptide components of the
kustd1699-1713 gene cluster. Herein, kustd1712 would be membrane-bound by no
less than 15 predicted TMHs. The ﬁrst N-terminal half of kustd1712 displays
signiﬁcant sequence identity with the quinone- and heme b-binding subunit
(CydA) of cytochrome bd oxidase (CydAB) [71]. Kustd1705, kustd1708, and
kustd1711 again are preceded by N-terminal cleavage sites and possess CXXCH
motifs for the binding of one, four, and two c-type hemes, respectively. In front and
at the end of the kustd1699-1713 cluster, two genes are found that encode exported
proteins with type-1 cupredoxin features that are homologous to kustc0456 encoun-
tered before (Section 3.3.4). Together, these proteins provide an array of mobile and
membrane-bound carriers that somehow are involved in electron and possibly
proton-translocating processes related with nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction.
However, the speciﬁc role of each of them remains to be established.

3.4.2
Nitrite Reduction to Ammonium
In the presence of inorganic electron donors such as Fe(II) compounds, Mn2+ and
possibly dihydrogen, or organic compounds, most notably formate, acetate or
propionate, anammox bacteria may adopt a lifestyle “disguised” as denitriﬁer
[28]. Different species may even have specialized in the use of certain electron
donors, providing them a competitive advantage. For instance, Candidatus
‘Brocadia fulgida’ was speciﬁcally enriched in a medium that contained ammonium
and nitrite supplemented with a low (1 mM) concentration of acetate [28]. In
contrast, Candidatus ‘Anammoxoglobus propionicus’ came to the fore under the
same enrichment conditions and with the same inoculum, except that propionate
substituted for acetate [28]. As outlined in Section 2.1, during “disguised” denitri-
ﬁcation half of nitrite is reduced to ammonium, which combines with the other half
to produce dinitrogen gas in the anammox process (Figure 1). Consequently, all N2
is produced from nitrite or nitrate, as is also the case with “true” denitriﬁcation. The
key enzyme in “disguised” denitriﬁcation would be the nitrite reductase making
ammonium. This is also the key enzyme in the so-called DNRA bacteria that make
a living from the dissimilatory nitrite/nitrate reduction to ammonium.

DNRA bacteria occur in broad and likely only partly appreciated diversity of
species in many ecosystems where they make a short circuit in the N-cycle
[72]. The organisms use nitrite as terminal electron acceptor, which is reduced by
the input of six electrons to ammonium without the release of intermediates
(eq. 12). This type of nitrite respiration is mediated by the NrfHA/NrfABCD
systems that are discussed in Chapter 9 of ref. [138]. Brieﬂy, NrfH is a
membrane-bound tetraheme c protein belonging to the NapC/NirT family of
menaquinol oxidases [45, 73]. NrfH accepts the electrons from menaquinol and
transfers these to its associated catalytic part, NrfA. In enteric bacteria the alterna-
tive, partly soluble NrfABCD system is found in which the soluble pentaheme
cytochrome c NrfB mediates electron transfer between the catalytic NrfA (alterna-
tively named cytochrome c552 nitrite reductase) and the membrane-associated iron-
sulfur protein NrfC and NrfD, which is an assumed quinol dehydrogenase of the
NrfD/PsrC family [73]. Thus, NrfA represents the catalytic enzyme in both sys-
tems. NrfA is a homodimeric pentaheme cytochrome c protein (unrelated to NrfB)
localized in the periplasm. The ﬁve c-type hemes (1–5) of NrfA fully superimpose
hemes 4–8 of the HAO-like proteins shown in Figure 4. Heme-1 in NrfA represents
the catalytic site and it is the equivalent of heme-4 in the HAOs. A distinctive
feature of this heme-1 is the presence of a lysine as a proximal ligand, which is
signiﬁed by the CXXCK motif in the protein sequence. The presence of the lysine
seems to be a governing factor in the reactivity of NrfA, next to a conserved triad of
7
Anaerobic Oxidation of Ammonium and Methane
279

amino acids near the active site (R114, Y218, H277; numbering according to the
Wolinella succinogenes structure, PDB ID 1FS7) [74].
The nature of a NrfA-like protein in anammox bacteria has been elusive for quite
some time. The reason for this is that no pentaheme protein could be found in
sequenced genomes with the diagnostic CXXCK motif and the RYH triad. Mem-
bers of the Campylobacteriaceae such as Campolybacter jejuni [75] and
Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans [76] that are known for their DNRA activity
lack the particular pentaheme proteins as well. However, cytochrome c552 nitrite
reductases have been annotated in their genomes, yet bearing the common CXXCH
binding motif for heme-1. Deletion and expression analyses of the alternative
Campolybacter jejuni pentaheme protein demonstrated that it is a nitrite reductase
making ammonium [77]. The alternative NrfAs remain to be characterized regard-
ing the nature of the proximal ligand to heme-1. It is possible that this ligand is a
lysine derived from another part of the protein sequence, rather than a histidine.
Furthermore, detailed sequence analyses afﬁliated the Campylobacteriaceae and
A. dehalogenans proteins with a broad class of NrfAs that covered 18 clades (A-R),
three of which (J-L) being characterized by a CXXCH motif for heme-1
[78]. Importantly, close homologs of one of the three clades (K) are found in the
genomes of anammox strain KSU-1 (KSU1_B0055) [34], of Brocadia species [36]
and of Jettenia ([35]; D. Speth and M. Oshiki, personal communication). In these
genomes, nrfA genes are localized next to the ones coding for tetraheme NrfH
proteins. However, the genome of K. stuttgartiensis, which is able of ammonium
formation from nitrite [28], lacks the particular homolog, as does Scalindua.
Besides pentaheme nitrite reductases, two different octaheme proteins are
known that reduce nitrite to ammonium with high catalytic efﬁciencies, both of
which crystal structures have been resolved: A homohexameric enzyme from
Thioalkalivibrio species [79] and a homodimeric enzyme from Shewanella
oneidensis [80]. Despite a limited amino acid sequence identity, the spatial
arrangement of the eight hemes is highly similar in both types. In fact, heme
arrangements are conserved with respect the ones of the octaheme HAO-like
proteins described above (Figure 4) and of pentaheme NrfA. Like in NrfA, the
catalytic hemes are proximally ligated by a lysine, albeit in different fashions. In
the S. oneidensis enzyme, the catalytic heme-2 receives the coordinating ε-amine
from a lysine in a distal part of the amino acid sequence [80], whereas the catalytic
heme-4 in the Thioalkalivibrio proteins is lysine-coordinated by the CXXCK
heme-4 binding sequence [79]. Notwithstanding the extant collection of octaheme
proteins (Figure 5), homologs of those octaheme nitrite reductases are absent in
genomes of anammox bacteria. Still, this does not rule out that one of the
anammox HAOs fulﬁls a physiological function of an ammonium-forming nitrite
reductase. In this respect, it is interesting to note that kustd2021 homologs
(Figure 5) are consistently present in genomes that lack the alternative
(CXXCH) NrfA, whereas genomes of anammox species that possess such NrfA
are devoid of kustd2021 homologs.

Enzymes in Nitrite-Driven Methane Oxidation
M. oxyfera derives its energy for growth from the oxidation of methane coupled to
the reduction of nitrite or nitrate (eqs 3 and 4). Presently, none but one of the
enzymes involved in these processes has been puriﬁed and characterized. Progress
in the ﬁeld is severely hampered by the extremely slow growth rate and growth
yield of the organism, which is enriched as tight aggregates that withstand a
convenient cell breaking and protein extraction. Consequently, our knowledge on
M. oxyfera metabolism mainly relies on what its genome tells us and what we have
learned from detailed functional and structural studies on homologous enzymes
from methanotrophic, methylotrophic, and denitrifying model organisms. A strik-
ing aspect of the genome of M. oxyfera is the redundancy of many of its catabolic
enzymes [18]. In the genome, the inventory is found for two different nitrate
reductases, multiple heme-copper oxidases including Nor-like proteins, three dif-
ferent methanol dehydrogenases, two different pathways for formaldehyde-formate
interconversion and three different formate/formyl dehydrogenase systems. The
rationale behind this redundancy is unclear and an answer may come only from
future physiological, biochemical and perhaps genetic research.
4.1
The Nitrite Reduction Route
4.1.1
Nitrite and Nitrate Reduction to Nitric Oxide
The genome of M. oxyfera harbors the inventory for two different nitrate reductases, the
membrane-bound NarGHI system brieﬂy mentioned in Section 3.4.1, which is localized
in the cytoplasm, and the periplasmic NapAB system [30, 81]. Both systems are well
studied in denitriﬁers [81], which includes the elucidation of several crystal structures
[62, 65, 82]. Both systems are only lowly expressed at the transcriptome and proteome
levels in M. oxyfera, which makes sense in enrichment cultures grown on nitrite.
In the genome of M. oxyfera, the NarGHI system is encoded on the
DAMO_0779-0774 gene cluster (Figure 9a). Structural genes are represented by
DAMO_0778 (narG), DAMO_0776 (narH) and DAMO_0774 (narI). The genes
are interspersed by genes coding for a hemerythrin-like protein (DAMO_0777) and
the common NarJ (DAMO_0775) with a chaperone function [70]. At the end of the
cluster, DAMO_ 0779 codes for a c-type triheme protein that could be bound to the
membrane by one TMH in its C-terminus. DAMO_ 0779 shows ~40 % sequence

structurally resolved nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli [62, 65] is less, but all
structural features are conserved in M. oxyfera NarGHI. Conserved features com-
prise domain organization of the three subunits, amino acids that bind the
Mo-bisPGD prosthetic group and the 4Fe4S cluster in NarG, amino acids in
NarH that coordinate the four iron-sulfur clusters, and those in NarI that are related
with the binding of two heme b molecules and menaquinone. Unlike many other
NarG subunits, DAMO_0778 is not preceded by a tat signal for protein export, but
in other systems the N-terminus is protected from cleavage to leave the nitrate
reductase in the cytosol [83].
Contrary to Nar, the Nap system is localized in the periplasm (Figure 9c). In its
essence, the Nap system is composed of the heterodimeric NapAB in which NapA
is a molybdopterin protein bearing a 4Fe4S cluster in its N-terminal region, as is the
case for NarG and other MPT proteins. NapB is a c-type diheme protein. NapAB is
well deﬁned by the elucidation of the crystal structures from four different micro-
bial species [82]. The catalytic molybdenum is coordinated by six sulfur atoms, four
of which originate from the two dithiolene molybdopterin cofactors that both are
present as tricyclic (pyranopterin) ring structures (Figure 8b). The M. oxyfera genes
coding for NapAB (DAMO_2411 and DAMO_2410, respectively) form part of a
larger gene cluster (DAMO_2408-2415) that includes the inventory for the nitrite
reductase described next (Figure 9b). In DAMO_2411 and DAMO_2410, all amino
acids implicated in NapAB crystal structures with the binding and structuring of the
Mo-bisPGD, iron-sulfur and heme c cofactors are conserved. The identity suggests
functionality of NapAB from M. oyfera, if expressed. In agreement with a peri-
plasmic localization, DAMO-2410 contains a tat signal for protein export. Remark-
ably, the DAMO_2408-2415 cluster lacks any genes that in other Nap systems code
for membrane-bound components, such as NapD, NapF, NapG, and NapH, that
provide the electrons for nitrate reduction by the oxidation of menaquinol
[84]. Since genes coding for such membrane-bound Nap components are absent
in other parts of the genome as well, reduction of nitrate by M. oxyfera Nap might
rely on a reduced cytochrome c pool.
The reduction of nitrite to NO in M. oxyfera is catalyzed by cytochrome cd1
(NirS) of which structural and accessory genes are contained within the
DAMO_2408-2415 cluster (Figure 9b). In this cluster, DAMO_2409 codes for a
gene product comprising a fusion between a AsnC-family transcriptional regulator,
and NirD/G and NirL/H involved in the biosynthesis of heme d. DAMO_2412 and
DAMO_2413 code for two more heme d biosynthesis proteins, NirF and NirJ,
respectively. The catalytic nitrite-reducing enzyme, NirS is derived from the
DAMO_2415 gene. The DAMO_2415 amino acid sequence shows a remarkable
high identity (61 %) to the one of K. stuttgartiensis NirS (kuste4136; see Sec-
tion 3.1), but the M. oxyfera sequence is also highly similar to NirS from Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa NirS (53 % identity) and from Paracoccus pantotrophus NirS
(53 % identity), both having known crystal structures [85]. Indeed, the identity
encompasses the conservation in DAMO_2415 of all structurally and functionally
relevant amino acids found in the crystal structures. In agreement with the central
role in metabolism, DAMO_2415 is one of the highest expressed genes in the
7
Anaerobic Oxidation of Ammonium and Methane
283

genome and one of the most abundant proteins in the proteome [18]. Translated
DAMO_2415 is preceded by an N-terminal signal sequence and antibodies raised
against speciﬁc peptide sequences conﬁrm its localization in the periplasm
[86]. Protein translocation might be supported by the product of the DAMO_2408
gene in front of the DAMO_2408-2415 cluster (Figure 9b), which codes for YajC,
one of the components of the Sec-YidC-YajC machinery for protein export and
membrane protein insertion [87]. However, the DAMO_2408-2415 cluster again
lacks one conspicuous candidate: The gene encoding NirC, a c-type cytochrome
that provides the electron for nitrite reduction.
Besides the dissimilatory NirS, M. oxyfera contains the gene complement for an
assimilatory nitrite reductase (NasBD). NasBD is composed of the NasD small
subunit carrying a 2Fe2S Rieske-type iron-sulfur cluster and the NasB large subunit
with a siroheme as its catalytic cofactor. The enzyme catalyzes the NAD(P)H-
dependent reduction of nitrite to ammonium, similar to NrfA (see Section 3.4.2)
[88]. In the genome of M. oxyfera, nasB (DAMO_0865; nirB) and nasD
(DAMO_0864; nirD) belong to a larger gene cluster (DAMO_0859-0867) that
covers a catalytic and regulatory inventory for nitrogen assimilation, such as
NAD(P)H-dependent glutamine synthetase (GOGAT) and the NRI-NRII (glnLG;
ntrBC) two-component regulatory system. However, genes coding for assimilatory
nitrate reductase (NasAB) that are often found in Nas operons [89] are absent both
in the DAMO_0859-0867 gene cluster as well as in other parts of the genome.
4.1.2
Nitric Oxide Reductase-like Proteins in M. oxyfera
Free radical nitric oxide is a highly reactive compound and nature has invented a
plethora of enzymes that are capable to reduce NO to the less toxic N2O (eq. 13).
Denitrifying Bacteria and Archaea contain membrane-bound respiratory nitric
oxide reductases (NOR). Interestingly, such NORs are also found in some
non-denitrifying pathogenic bacteria, presumably to protect the cell against NO
released by the host’s immune system [90].

Initially two NOR subclasses were proposed based on amino acid sequences and
type of electron donor [91], cytochrome c-dependent NOR (cNOR) that receives
electrons from soluble protein electron donors (either cytochromes c or
pseudoazurin) and quinol-dependent NOR (qNOR). Three-dimensional structures
at atomic resolution were obtained for both types [92] and helped to establish the
molecular details of this class of enzymes. An additional hybrid NOR, termed
qCuANOR, has been described for Bacillus azotoformans that oxidizes both soluble
cytochromes and membrane-embedded quinols [93]. The recent sequencing of the
genome of B. azotoformans identiﬁed this qCuANOR as a sNOR [94], one of
several novel NOR types [95] (see next). In the ﬁrst genome survey of M. oxyfera
three homologous nitric oxide reductase-encoding genes were detected, all three
284
Reimann, Jetten, and Keltjens

proteins belonging to the group of qNORs. However, as outlined below two of these
proteins likely have another function, whereas two more NORs can be added to the
M. oxyfera repertoire due to erroneous annotation resulting from at least some
confusion in the genomic NOR scenery.
Early sequence analyses [96] unambiguously identiﬁed NORs as members of the
heme-copper oxidase (HCO) superfamily that comprises terminal oxidases such as
the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase or the bacterial cbb3 oxidase (see also
Chapter 4). All members of the superfamily share sequence similarities in the
catalytic subunit I. This subunit I is membrane-bound by 12 or 14 TMHs. In all
known heme-copper oxidases, subunit I harbors a six-coordinated low-spin heme
(a or b-type) that functions as electron mediator to the active site (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Schematic representation of the catalytic site of members of the heme-copper oxidase
superfamily represented by (a) oxidases and (b) dissimilatory nitric oxide reductases (NORs). The
catalytic site comprises a low-spin (ls) heme for electron transfer and a binuclear catalytic part
composed of a high-spin (hs) heme with either a copper ion (CuB) as in oxidases or an iron ion (FeB)
as is the case with NORs. The different amino acids (H, X1-X3) that coordinate these moieties are
highlighted by light grey squares. X4 and X5 are second shell amino acids within the FeB coordination
sphere at which the X5 (glutamate) in cytochrome c-dependent NOR (cNOR) has been implicated in
proton transfer to the active site. X5 in sNORs is variable. (c) Amino acid variations (X1-X5) that are

The active site, where substrate binds and is converted is a unique dinuclear center
formed by a ﬁve-coordinated high-spin heme (a, b or o-type) and a non-heme metal.
In oxygen-reducing HCO, the non-heme metal is a copper ion (CuB) able to cycle
between Cu+ and Cu2+. All examined NORs harbor an iron ion at this position
(FeB), which together with the heme-Fe forms a dinuclear iron site (Figure 10b),
suitable to accommodate two NO molecules simultaneously and catalyze the
reductive conversion to N2O. Although it was found that the crystallized qNOR
from Geobacillus stearothermophilus coordinated a zinc ion as the non-heme metal
[92a] (Figure 11), it is regarded as an artifact based on the loss of catalytic activity
when iron is substituted for zinc. How the type of metal contributes to the speciﬁc
catalytic abilities resulting in NO or O2 reduction is not understood. Interestingly in
this respect is that some NO and O2 reductases exhibit cross reactivity towards O2
and NO, respectively [97].
The three metallic cofactors (two heme Fe and one Cu/Fe) in subunit I are ligated
by six histidine residues (Figure 10). For a long time, these six histidines were
thought to be invariant and diagnostic for all HCOs. Two histidines coordinate the
electron-transferring low-spin heme iron, one histidine the active site high-spin
heme iron and the remaining three are non-heme metal-coordinating. A crucial
active-site residue, which is absent in NORs, is a conserved tyrosine that is
covalently bound to one of the CuB-ligating histidines and acts as a temporary
electron and proton donor during O2 reduction [98]. This cross-linked tyrosine is
critical to distinguish between NO- and O2-reducing HCOs. In contrast, a charac-
teristic feature for cNOR and qNOR enzymes is a conserved glutamate, which is
part of the FeB ligation sphere providing a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordi-
nation geometry to the iron ion. Yet, a detailed survey by Hemp and Gennis [95] of
sequences that had been automatically annotated in Archaeal genomes as HCOs,
highly suggests that the NOR picture is far from complete and more diffuse. For
example, members of a family, referred to as sNORs [95], are phylogenetically
closest related to O2-reducing B-type oxidases and share a considerable sequence
similarity to members of this subfamily. However, they lack the cross-linked
tyrosine, and unlike cNORs and qNORs the FeB-ligating glutamate is substituted
by an asparagine. The particular features are retrieved in the above-mentioned
qCuANOR from B. azotoformans [94] and they are also found in HCO-like proteins
from other denitrifying bacteria, including M. oxyfera.
4.1.3
The Making of Oxygen
As shown by genome analysis and activity experiments, O2 is not only an essential
but also a measureable intermediate in the nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of
methane in M. oxyfera [18]. Since external supply of oxygen was excluded, Ettwig
et al. [18] postulated a mechanism by which NO serves as the source of intracel-
lularly produced O2. In the proposed scheme two molecules of NO are dispropor-
tionated into N2 and O2 (eq. 14).

This reaction is thermodynamically highly exergonic but kinetically challeng-
ing. The conversion of NO into O2 and N2 involves the breaking of two N-O double
bonds together with the formation of an N-N triple bond and an O-O double bond
and is thus assumed to proceed with low turnover rates. This chemistry has not been
observed in biological systems before. Therefore, a candidate “nitric oxide
dismutase” (NOD) that could catalyze this reaction could not be identiﬁed by
homology.
Besides the primary question, which enzyme would catalyze NO dismutation,
even puzzling was that the genome of M. oxyfera coded for three qNOR homologs
[18]. Two of these (DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434) were among the most abun-
dantly expressed proteins; the third one (DAMO_1889) was hardly expressed. The
presence in the genome and expressions of these qNOR-like proteins opposed
the observation that the microorganism produced N2O at trace levels only, while
the gene coding for the only known enzyme capable of N2O reduction, N2OR, could
not be detected. Furthermore, the detailed inspection of the DAMO_2437 and
DAMO_2434 sequences exhibited amino acid substitutions at positions that were
recognized in canonical qNOR as being essential for electron transfer and reductive
conversion of NO [99].
Crystallization of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus qNOR in the presence of
the quinol analogue 2-heptyl hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) permitted the
identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc binding site for (mena)quinol (Figure 11b) [92a]. Part
of this binding pocket is provided by several semi-conserved hydrophobic residues
that form a binding groove for the hydrocarbon tail of the quinol moiety. Speciﬁc
interactions with functional groups of the HQNO core are formed by a set of highly
conserved amino acids. His328 and Asp746 (Geobacillus numbering) form
H-bonds with the NO and OH groups, respectively. In DAMO_2437 and
DAMO_2434 both of these residues are substituted mostly by functionally dissim-
ilar amino acids (Figure 11c) and it is thus conceivable that quinol binding and
consequently electron donation is impaired in these proteins. Since alternative
electron entry sites are absent (cytochrome c as in cNOR and CuA as in sNOR) in
DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434, electron-consuming NO conversion seems
unlikely. Additional features of DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434 are a slightly
altered active site conﬁguration (Figure 11e). One of the three FeB coordinating
His residues (His560 DAMO_2437 numbering) is exchanged for an asparagine.
Next, the highly conserved second coordination shell Glu581, which was impli-
cated in proton transfer to the active site in cNOR [100] is replaced by a glutamine.
Although variations in the amino acid composition of the catalytic site in NOR
seem to be more widespread than anticipated, the particular deviations observed in
DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434 clearly disfavor a role as NOR. The deviations
very well might facilitate another reaction, NO disproportionation.
Importantly, the speciﬁc substitutions are conserved in some other proteins in
genome databases, namely close homologs of DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434 in

the NC10 enrichment culture strain Ooij and a putative NOR from the γ
proteobacterial strain HdN1 (Figures 11c and e) [99]. HdN1 is capable of growth
on C6-C20 alkanes [101]. Growth on hexadecane proceeds with oxygen, nitrate or
nitrite as electron acceptors but not with N2O. However, N2O does serve as the
oxidant with hexadecanol or hexadecanoic acid as substrates, compounds that do
not require the oxidative activation of a C-H bond. Even though the genome of
HdN1 lacks any genes coding for the glycyl-radical-catalyzed activation of alkanes,
two or three monooxygenase-encoding genes are present. Taken together, these
observations suggest that alkane activation in HdN1 and methane activation in
M. oxyfera might proceed in similar ways, supported by oxygen that is made via
nitrate and nitrite by a NOR-like NO dismutase.
4.1.4
Nitric Oxide and Oxygen Reduction
Unlike DAMO_2437 and DAMO_2434, the amino acid sequence of DAMO_1889
complies with a functional qNOR (Figures 11c and e). As already mentioned, the
gene is hardly expressed, which accords the insigniﬁcant N2O production in
M. oxyfera cultures growing on methane and nitrite [18]. Nevertheless, the situation
regarding NO reduction could be more complicated at the genomic and physiolog-
ical levels.
The nitrite-dependent conversion of methane (eq. 3) is associated with a theo-
retical surplus of one molecule of O2 and four electrons. Whole cells are capable of
O2 reduction at rates that exceed the methane-converting metabolic activity
[29]. Indeed, the genome of M. oxyfera seemed to harbor no less than three different
HCO-type oxidases, next to a plant-like alternative oxidase [18, 29]. Supported by
substrate-speciﬁc O2 reduction rates and expression data, it was argued [29] that the
residual O2 would be reduced to water by DAMO_1118-19. This protein complex
had been annotated as a bo3-type oxidase belonging to the class A2 of heme-copper
oxidases. A reevaluation now of the protein sequence reveals that DAMO_1118-19
is not an O2 reductase but rather a member of a divergent type of gNORs. Similarly,
DAMO_0801-02, which was being annotated as ba3 oxidase, appears to belong to

the new NO-reductase type of sNORs. The only oxidase that stands a proper
annotation, namely as an aa3-type oxidase, is DAMO_1162-65. The aa3-type
oxidase, which is the most efﬁcient proton-pumping terminal oxidase but which
has an only low afﬁnity for oxygen, tends to be expressed under high-oxygen
conditions. A role of the DAMO_1162-65 aa3-type oxidase as being responsible
for O2 reduction could be ruled out on the basis of too low activities and too low
expression values indeed [29]. Hence, it is still an open issue, which enzyme from
M. oxyfera acts in O2 removal. Considering that oxygen reductase activity with
turnover numbers up to 8.4 μmol O2 · min1 · mg1 protein has been demonstrated
for c- and qNOR [97, 102], one of the NO reductases, perhaps even gNOR
DAMO_1118-19, might moonlight as an O2 reductase. And taking the slow met-
abolic rates of M. oxyfera (1–2 nmol CH4 · min1 · mg1 protein) into account, an
even minute amount of NOR would sustain oxygen reduction.
However lowly expressed under standard growth, the question remains what the
redundant set of known qNOR (DAMO_1889), and new gNOR (DAMO_1118-19)
and sNOR (DAMO_0801-02) would do. The set may provide the organism with a
means to cope with nitrosative stress invoked by other members of a denitrifying
community. Next, NO is an essential intermediary substrate of nitrite-dependent
methane oxidation and the tight balancing of its production and subsequent (quite
slow) conversion is necessary to avoid harmful concentrations. The balance could
be easily disturbed by the uptake of external electron donors more oxidized than
methane, such as formate, immediately resulting in excess nitrite reduction to
NO. Under such conditions, reductive conversion of NO into N2O is advantageous
over its disproportionation into N2 and O2, which is expected to occur very slowly
thereby requiring a vast amount of enzyme for appreciable activity.
4.2
The Methane Oxidation Pathway
4.2.1
The Activation of Methane into Methanol
In aerobic methanotrophs, inert methane is activated to methanol by the insertion of
an oxygen atom from O2. The other oxygen atom is reduced to water (eq. 15).
Methane activation is catalyzed by two different methane monooxygenases
(MMO), a particulate, membrane-bound (pMMO) and a soluble (sMMO) form.
M. oxyfera contains only pMMO. Although the enzyme has already been discussed
in detail in Chapter 6 of this Volume, we will recall some of its main structural
properties for the sake of comparison.

Supported by the resolution of the crystal structures from three different
methanotrophs [103], the common view is that pMMO is composed of α3β3γ3
trimers with three copies each of the pmoA, pmoB, and pmoC subunits ordered
290
Reimann, Jetten, and Keltjens

in a cylindrical way within the cell membrane. PmoA is primarily composed of 6–7
TMHs; three conserved periplasmic aromatic amino acids (F50, W51, W54; num-
bering according to the Methylococcus capsulatus structure) are proposed to line a
methane substrate channel [2]. Also pmoC is membrane-bound by 5 TMHs. PmoB
is structured by two cupredoxin domains located in the N-and C-terminal parts.
Both domains are separated by two TMHs, but they are positioned next to each
other by a linker loop; a third TMH is N-terminally cleaved. The cupredoxin
domains face the periplasm and represent the only soluble part of the enzyme
complex. Sandwiched between the two cupredoxin domains, three histidines
(H33, H137, H139) ligate a dicopper center in the M. capsulatus protein [103],
but the Methylocystis structure is more ambiguous, showing both one and two
copper atoms at this side [103]. By stripping the two THMs from pmoB and
connecting the cupredoxin domains by a short linker such that the overall structure
was maintained, a copper-containing recombinant protein was made that was
catalytically active by itself, both with methane and the abiological substrate
propylene [104]. This clever approach clearly shows that pmoB is the catalytic
site. Also the other subunits may bind copper and/or zinc atoms, but there is at least
some disagreement concerning the relevance of these metals; they could have been
the artiﬁcial result of enzyme puriﬁcation and crystallization methods [2].
The genome of M. oxyfera harbors one pMMO, the subunits of which are
encoded by DAMO_2451 (pmoC1), DAMO_2450 (pmoA), and DAMO_2448
(pmoB). Consistent with their central role in metabolism, the three genes are
among the highest expressed, both at the transcriptome and proteome levels
[18]. Immunogold labeling of afﬁnity-puriﬁed antibodies raised against the soluble
part of pmoB localize it at the periplasmic side of the cell membrane as expected
[86]. DAMO_2339 codes for a second pmoC, which is identical to DAMO_2451.
Downstream of DAMO_2448, DAMO_2446 has been annotated as pmoD1 of
which a second copy (pmoD2; 84 % sequence identity) is found as DAMO_2340.
PmoD is predicted to be an exported protein that remains membrane-bound by one
TMH in the C-terminus. Homologs of this protein are found in genomes of many
methanotrophic and non-methanotrophic species. Contrary to M. oxyfera, those
pmoD homologs are never linked to genes encoding pMMOs and it is questionable
whether pmoD forms part of the pMMO complex in M. oxyfera. At ﬁrst sight,
sequence identities of pmoA, pmoB, and pmoC from M. oxyfera are not very high
(~50 %) with respect to the ones in pMMOs with known crystal structures and
phylogenetic analyses place all three M. oxyfera subunits in a separate clade
[18]. Nevertheless, subunit sequences of veriﬁed pMMOs are also quite divergent.
In fact, a closer comparison reveals the complete conservation in M. oxyfera
pMMO of all secondary structural elements (TMHs and their topology, β barrel
strands in the cupredoxin domains) with respect to those with known crystal
structures. Moreover, all amino acids that have been implicated in the binding of
metals, no matter their eventual biochemical relevance, are present in pmoA,
pmoB, and pmoC from M. oxyfera. These similarities suggest a same overall
architecture of M. oxyfera pMMO and a same function, namely the oxygen-
dependent activation of methane (eq. 15). In agreement herewith, in experiments

with whole cells the role of oxygen was substantiated in propylene epoxidation, a

Structural considerations and the observed role for oxygen in propylene epox-

namely by using the oxidative power of NO (or N2O) (eqs 16 and 17). Although
thermodynamically highly feasible, the reactions are incompatible with the phys-
iology of M. oxyfera. Apart from the mechanistic problem how dinitrogen gas
would be produced in case of activation by one NO, it can be inferred that
substantial amounts of N2O should be formed to maintain the redox balance.
Since no electrons are required for methane activation (Figure 2), the only way to
get rid of the extra electrons would be nitrite reduction to the level of N2O. In active
metabolizing cells, the gas can only be detected at trace levels [18].
4.2.2
Methanol Oxidation
Microorganisms have two different types of enzymes at their disposal to oxidize
methanol, the product of methane activation. Gram-positive bacteria utilize meth-
anol dehydrogenases that take NAD(P)+ as the electron acceptor and that are
localized in the cytoplasm [105]. In Gram-negative methylo- or methanotrophs, a
periplasmic MDH is present, which belongs to the broad class of pyrroloquinoline
quinone
(PQQ)-containing
proteins
(quinoproteins)
[106].
The
particular
quinoproteins are structured by eight sets of four-stranded, antiparallel W-shaped
β sheets that tightly pack the protein backbone into eight propeller-like peptide
sequences according to a pseudo eight-fold symmetry axis (Figure 12). The cata-
lytic cofactor, PQQ, is located central to the propellers, buried deeply inside a
hydrophobic pocket. PQQ is kept in position by a series of in-plane hydrogen bonds
to the side chains and carbonyl groups of a conserved set of amino acids.
Different types of quinoproteins catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of
alcohol and aldehyde substrates and each type is more or less tuned for a speciﬁc
substrate. The oxidation occurs at the PQQ cofactor and involves a base-catalyzed
proton abstraction in concert with the transfer of a hydride from the substrate to
PQQ (Figure 13) [107]. By accepting the hydride, PQQ gets reduced to PQQH2.
After the subsequent transfer of two electrons to an associated electron carrier, a
c-type heme protein, PQQH2 is re-oxidized and the enzyme is prepared for a next
reaction cycle. In most quinoproteins studied to date, a calcium ion in close vicinity
to PQQ assists in hydride abstraction. By acting as a Lewis-acid, the C5-O5 bond in
PQQ is polarized, which facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the hydride to
C5 (Figure 13). The Ca2+ ion is kept in the right conﬁguration by the coordination
to two highly conserved amino acids, a glutamate and an asparagine (Figures 12c
and d). Proton abstraction is assisted by a conserved aspartate.

MDH catalyzes the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde according to equation
(18). The genome of M. oxyfera codes for three MDH quinoprotein systems (MDH1-
3) that are uniquely located on one large cluster (DAMO_0112-0138) (Figure 14). In
the MDH1 system (DAMO_0112-122), DAMO_0112 (mxaF) and DAMO_0115
(mxaI) encode the large (α) and small (β) subunits, respectively, of the canonical
heterodimeric (α2β2) MxaFI-type of MDH. This type of MDH that carries calcium as
a PQQ-associated metal cofactor is well understood by the resolution of the crystal
structures from seven different microbial species [109]. Besides these structural
genes, the MDH1 system comprises a range of other genes that are commonly
associated with the functionality of MxaFI-MDH and that are ordered as also seen
in M. oxyfera [110]. DAMO_0114 codes for the cognate electron carrier, cytochrome
cL (MxaG) and DAMO_0113 for a periplasmic solute-binding protein (MxaJ) with an
as-yet unknown function. DAMO_0116-0121 ﬁnd their homologs (MxaRSACKLD)
for instance in Methylobacterium extorquens, a methylotrophic model organism,
where these gene products have been implemented with Ca2+ insertion [110]. In
the latter organism, MxaE (DAMO_0122 in M. oxyfera) is additionally required for
MxaFI maturation. Quite astonishingly, M. oxyfera lacks the gene inventory
(pqqABCDEF) [111] for PQQ biosynthesis [112]. This would make the organism
dependent on other microorganisms in its environment that supply M. oxyfera with a
crucial cofactor of one of its key enzymes.
The MDH2 and MDH3 systems code for divergent types of MDH quinoproteins,
termed XoxF-MDHs, which display sequence identities of less than 50 % with
MxaF large subunits. XoxF proteins are widely found in genomes of methylotrophs
and methanotrophs, but also in genomes of organisms that are as yet unknown for
such lifestyles. Their function has been enigmatic for quite some time [19]. The
recent puriﬁcation and characterization of XoxF proteins from different species
[113], and the elucidation of the atomic structure of one of these [114] solved the
enigma. Just like MxaFI-MDH, XoxF is a methanol-oxidizing quinoprotein. In fact,
large subunit structures are fully superimposable (Figures 12a and b). However,

there are two major differences: XoxF-MDH is a homodimeric protein (α2) com-
posed of a large PQQ-containing subunit only and PQQ is associated with a rare
earth element (REE) instead of Ca2+ (Figure 12d). REEs, such as cerium or
lanthanum, are stronger Lewis acids, lending XoxF-MDHs a catalytic efﬁciency
that is superior to their MxaFI-MDH counterparts [114, 115]. Because radii of REE
ions are bigger than of Ca2+, their proper accommodation requires a speciﬁc
adaptation of the amino acid sequence. This adaptation is found in a speciﬁc
aspartate residue that provides an additional ligand and that is located two positions
downstream of the catalytic aspartate (Figure 12e) [114, 115].
The various features can be discerned in the further inspection of the MDH2
(DAMO_0124-0133)
and
MDH3
(DAMO_0134-0138)
gene
systems
from
M. oxyfera (Figure 14). Herein, DAMO_0124 and DAMO_0134 code for XoxF
large subunit homologs [116]. Their amino acid sequences show the conservation
of the catalytic aspartate and of the amino acids involved in PQQ and metal
association, including the aspartate related with REE coordination (Figure 12e).
Still, DAMO_0124 and DAMO_0134 share only 43 % sequence identity and
phylogenetic analysis addresses these proteins to two different types of XoxF-
MDHs, namely XoxF1 and XoxF2, respectively. (One may note that no less than
ﬁve types of XoxF proteins can be distinguished [19]). The MDH1 and MDH2
systems lack genes that code for small subunits, but genes encoding cytochrome cL
(xoxG) and xoxJ paralogs are present (Figure 14). Next, the MDH2 and MDH3
sub-clusters lack any genes involved in Ca2+ insertion, which is common in XoxF
systems [115]. Quite unusually, the MDH2 sub-cluster harbors a second mxaE
copy. Two genes in the latter sub-cluster code for TonB-dependent uptake proteins.
These uptake proteins are consistently detected in genomes of microorganisms that
contain XoxF-type MDHs and they might play a role in the acquirement of poorly
soluble REEs [115].

The straightforward question is which of the three MDHs is functionally
expressed in M. oxyfera. The answer is somewhat surprising. The only methanol-
oxidizing enzyme that could be isolated was a heterodimer (α2β2) composed of
XoxF1 (DAMO_0124) large subunits and MxaI (DAMO_0115) small subunits
[116]. Although the diagnostic REE-binding aspartate is apparent in the
DAMO_0124 amino acid sequence, it is unknown whether the protein does harbor
a REE indeed. It is conceivable that in the presence of more available Ca2+ the latter
atom is bound, its coordination being assisted by the small subunit. Such assistance
would allocate the subunit a function.
4.2.3
Formaldehyde Oxidation
Out of the many ways to oxidize formaldehyde biochemically, M. oxyfera poten-
tially uses two (Figure 15). In the ﬁrst pathway, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin
(H4MPT) acts as the one-carbon unit (C1) carrier. Enzymes of this pathway are
highest expressed at the transcriptional and protein levels [18] indicating that major
part of the formaldehyde ﬂux passes this branch. The second, only lowly expressed
pathway is an analogous one with 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) as C1-carrier
serving biosynthetic reactions (Figure 15c).
The H4MPT-dependent pathway is found in many methylo- and methanotrophs
[19], and also in methylotrophic methanogens. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens that
produce methane by the reduction of CO2 or by the disproportionation of formate
use the route in the reversed order (see Chapter 6 of ref. [138]). In M. oxyfera, all
enzymes of the H4MPT pathway are encoded on a large gene cluster
(DAMO_0454-0473)
(Figure
15a)
highly
resembling
the
organization
in
methylotrophs
[117].
Besides
H4MPT-dependent
metabolic
enzymes,
the
M. oxyfera cluster comprises genes that encode one of three formate/formyl oxi-
dation systems described hereafter (see Section 4.2.4) as well as a conserved set of
genes that have been implicated in H4MPT biosynthesis [117]. Next, the
DAMO_0454-0473 cluster comprises various conserved genes that are absent in
methylotrophic C1-transfer clusters, possibly involved in the as-yet elusive synthe-
sis of the second C1-carrier in the route, methanofuran (MFR).
In the H4MPT route, formaldehyde oxidation starts with the binding of the
substrate to the C1 carrier to make 5,10-methylene- H4MPT (Figure 15b). This
reaction is catalyzed by the formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae). 5,10-methy-
lene-H4MPT oxidation by methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (Mtd) generates
5,10-methenyl-H4MPT, which is converted to 5-formyl-H4MPT by methenyl-
H4MPT cyclohydrolase (Mch). Fae (DAMO_0454) from M. oxyfera displays

function, sequence identities include the presence of critical amino acids for the
binding of substrates and for catalysis. However, the role of the Mtd protein

clades (MtdA-E) [19]. These Mtd types markedly differ in substrate afﬁnities.

The MtdB enzyme is speciﬁc for 5,10-methylene-H4MPT in combination with
both NAD+ for energy generation and NADP+ for biosynthesis [120]. The MtdA
protein exclusively relies on NADP+ but it can use 5,10-methylene-H4MPT and 5,10-
methylene-H4F to variable degrees [121]. MtdC proteins are even more promiscuous
in these respects [122]. The Mtd from M. oxyfera takes a unique intermediary position
in between the MtdB and MtdA clades [19]. The sequence comparison between the
M. oxyfera protein and MtdA from M. extorquens having a known crystal structure
[123] reveals the nearly complete conservation of NADP+-binding amino acids, but
amino acids in the H4MPT/H4F-binding domain in M. extorquens MtdA are less well
conserved in the M. oxyfera protein sequence. Apparently, M. oxyfera Mtd evolved
such as to optimally sustain catabolism, i.e., substrate oxidation to CO2, and C1
anabolism through H4F-dependent reactions (Figures 15b and c).
The H4F-dependent counterpart in between the formaldehyde and formate
oxidation
states
is
the
bifunctional
NAD(P)+-dependent
5,10-methylene-
H4F:5,10-methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase (FolD, DAMO_1852) that generates
10-formyl-H4F (Figure 15c). Substrates might be supplied to this enzyme in
connection with Mtd activity just described or by the non-enzymic binding of
formaldehyde to H4F generating 5,10-methylene-H4F. The various H4folate deriv-
atives are substrates for amino acid (serine, methionine) and purine (thymidylate)
syntheses that depend on C1 compounds. In M. oxyfera, all enzymes involved use
H4F as the C1 carrier, underlining the central role of this cofactor in biosynthetic
processes. Formate for purine synthesis can be formed by 10-formyl-H4F lyase
(PurU,
DAMO_2586)
that
hydrolyzes
10-formyl-H4F
into
formate
and
H4F. However, there may be more means to make formate.
4.2.4
Formate Oxidation
Formate is a powerful electron donor that plays a key role in the energy metabolism
of many respiratory and fermentative microorganisms. Nature has evolved an
amazing variation in the way formate is oxidized to CO2 by formate dehydroge-
nases (eq. 19), ﬁrst and for all regarding their structural and functional organization
[124]. The common property is the presence of a pterin cofactor (bisPGD) in the
catalytic FDH subunit [125]. In FDHs, the cofactor is coordinated to either
molybdenum (Mo-bisPGD) or tungsten (W-bisPGD) at which the metal addition-
ally binds either cysteine or selenocysteine.

In methanogenic and sulfate-reducing Archaea, the formyl group bound to
methanofuran is oxidized to CO2 by formyl-MFR dehydrogenase (fMFR-DH)
(eq. 20; see also Chapter 6 of ref. [138]). As is the case with FDHs, the catalytic
subunit is a MPT protein carrying either molybdenum (Fmd systems) or tungsten
(Fwd systems) [126]. Again, these metals are coordinated to either cysteine or
selenocysteine.
M. oxyfera has the disposal of three different formate/formyl oxidation systems
(Figure 16). The ﬁrst one (FwdDFhcBADC; DAMO_0456-0460) is coded as part of
the formaldehyde-oxidizing gene cluster (DAMO_0454-0473) (Figure 15). Herein,
M. oxyfera FhcBADC resembles the four-subunit formyl transferase/hydrolase (Fhc)
from aerobic methylotrophs that is associated in these organisms with the C1 cluster
as well [127]. Indeed, M. oxyfera FhcD (DAMO_0459) shows 48 % sequence
identity to FhcD from M. extorquens that has been identiﬁed as 5-formyl-H4MPT:
methanofuran formyltransferase catalyzing reaction (21) [128]. In methanogenic and
sulfate-reducing Archaea, this formyltransferase is present as a separate enzyme.
Remarkably, the sequence identity of DAMO_0459 is even higher (53 %) with the
formyltransferase from the distantly related methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri,
having a known crystal structure [129], than with M. extorquens FhcD. M. oxyfera
FhcA (DAMO_0458) is homologous both to M. extorquens FhcA and to the FwdA
subunit of archaeal Fwd systems. This polypeptide is a member of the superfamily of
metallo-dependent amidohydrolases and likely catalyzes formyl-MFR hydrolysis to
formate (eq. 22). Formation of formate by the M. extorquens FhcCDAB complex is
consistent with such a role [127]. M. oxyfera FhcC (DAMO_0460) has its homologs
in FhcC from methylotrophs and in archaeal FwdC/FmdC subunits. FhcB from
M. oxyfera (DAMO_0457) is an interesting case.
While the sequence identity with FhcB from M. extorquens is only low (22 %),
the identity with cysteine- or selenocysteine-containing FwdB subunits [130] is
much higher, especially with respect to M. kandleri (~46 %). In Archaea, FwdB
mostly represents the MPT-catalytic subunit [130, 131]. FhcB from M. oxyfera
shares with the M. kandleri FwdB subunits (MK0259 and MK1527) the presence in
the N-terminus of four cysteines that commonly coordinate the 4Fe4S cluster in
MPT catalytic subunits. Next, three cysteines are conserved in DAMO_0457 with
respect to MK0259, two of which are substituted in MK1527 by a selenocysteine
and a serine. These similarities highly suggest a role of the DAMO_0456-0460
system as a formyltransferase/cysteine-containing formylmethanofuran dehydroge-
nase. In agreement with the proposal, DAMO_0456-0460 possesses one more
component, FwdD (DAMO_0456), which is unique for a non-Archaeon. Thus
far, the FwdD subunit has only been found in archaeal tungsten- or molybdenum-
containing (here: FmdE) fMFR-DHs. M. extorquens FhcB lacks the afore-mentioned
cysteines and the Fhc complex is devoid of an FwdD-like subunit [127]. These
differences would make the complex from aerobic methylotrophs inactive in formyl
oxidation, restricting its function to a formyltransferase/formate-generating hydrolase
[127]. Irrespective of its novelty, the FwdDFhcBADC system from M. oxyfera leaves
7

us with one issue: Where do the electrons from formyl/formate oxidation (eq. 20) go
to? All components are predicted to be cytoplasmic soluble proteins and the encoding
genes are not linked to ones (FwdFG) that code for iron-sulfur electron transfer
proteins in archaeal Fwd systems [130, 131]. Unfortunately, the genome of
M. oxyfera does not give an immediate clue to the issue.

Next to the previous formyl-MFR-dependent formyl/formate dehydrogenase
system, which is highest expressed at the transcriptional and protein levels [18],
the genome of M. oxyfera has the inventory of two alternative and much lower
expressed systems (Figure 16a, b). Both harbor a canonical formate dehydrogenase
catalytic subunit (FdhA). The ﬁrst alternative (DAMO_1134-1138) seems to rep-
resent a hybrid between fMFR-DH, common formate dehydrogenase and NADH-
dehydrogenase (complex I, Nuo) elements. The DAMO_1134-1138 genes form
part of a larger gene cluster (DAMO_1128-1147) (Figure 16a). The cluster encodes
more components required for formyl/formate/dehydrogenase functionality, such
as molybdate and tungstate ABC-type transporters, a porin that might facilitate
uptake of these metals, and selenocysteine and molybdopterin (MoaC) biosynthetic
genes. A two-component regulatory system and ModE-type transcriptional regula-
tor in front of the gene cluster could be involved in expression control.
Regarding the DAMO_1134-1138 formyl/formate dehydrogenase, DAMO_1134
is a FwD paralog (53 % sequence identity to DAMO_0456). DAMO_1135 and
DAMO_1136 have been annotated as two genes, but the DAMO_1135 stop codon
most likely represents a selenocysteine codon. Together the translated DAMO_1135-
36 sequences fully cover DAMO_0457 FhcB and the FwdB subunits of the
M. kandleri cysteine- (MK0259) and selenocysteine (MK1527) Fwds. Most notably,
the presumed end of DAMO_1135 matches the position (amino acid 120) of
selenocysteine in MK1527. These properties suggest a role of DAMO_1134-36 as
a selenocysteine-containing fMFR-DH. In DAMO_1138, all features are conserved
that have been identiﬁed in the crystal structure of E. coli formate dehydrogenase H
(FDH-H) [132] with the binding of the molybdo-bisPGD prosthetic group and the
preceding 4Fe4S cluster. Sequence conservation of DAMO_1138 with respect to
tungsten-containing FDH from Desulfovibrio gigas, another enzyme of which the
atomic structure has been resolved [133], is much lower (22 % identity) than with
E. coli FDH-H (36 %). This is indicative that DAMO_1138 binds Mo at its catalytic
metal. However, whereas FDH-H is a selenocysteine protein, in DAMO_1138 a
cysteine is present at the equivalent position. Still, there is one more major difference.
DAMO_1138 has an N-terminal extension that shows signiﬁcant sequence identity
with the NuoG subunit of bacterial complex I. The identity includes the presence of
the set of cysteines that coordinate two 2Fe2S and two 4Fe4S clusters in NuoG [134]
(Figure 16c). Otherwise, the extension is not unique for M. oxyfera and it is also seen
in formate dehydrogenases from sulfate reducers and homoacetogens. DAMO_1137
is homologous to the beta subunit of formate dehydrogenase (FdhB). Similarly to
NuoF in complex I [134], FdhB is the NAD(P)+- and ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN)-
binding subunit of FDH. Taken together, the analyses suggest that DAMO_1134-
1138 is a bifunctional enzyme, capable of formylmethanofuran and of formate
oxidation (eqs 19 and 20) using NAD(P)+ as the electron acceptor.
The third formate dehydrogenase is the simplest one consisting of two subunits
only (DAMO_0853-0854) (Figure 16). The DAMO_0853 sequence is 39.5 %
identical to the DAMO_1138 FdhA subunit. This identity includes a NuoG-like
N-terminal part. Similarly, in its C-terminal part DAMO_0854 displays 34 %
sequence identity to DAMO_1137 FdhB. Remarkably, DAMO_0854 (710 amino

301

acids) is much longer than DAMO_1137 (472 amino acids). The difference con-
cerns the presence in DAMO_0854 of the N-terminal extension that is related to the
NuoE subunit [134] of the bacterial (NuoA-N) complex I. Again, the data are in
agreement with a function of DAMO_0853-0854 as a NAD(P)+-dependent FDH.
All this brings us to the role of formate in the metabolism of M. oxyfera, which
could be a complex one like in methylotrophs [135]. It is known that cells of
M. oxyfera instantaneously use exogenous formate as the electron donor for nitrite
reduction and methane activation [18]. Thus, M. oxyfera is capable of formate uptake.
Within the cells, formate can be the product of formyl-H4F lyase (PurU) activity. Next,
formate could be made by methanol dehydrogenase. MDHs not only catalyze the
oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, but also its subsequent oxidation to formate,
and formaldehyde-oxidizing activity is particularly high in REE-containing XoxF
MDHs [114]. Thirdly, formate might be produced by the above FwdDFhcBADC
system (DAMO_0456-0460) similar to the M. extorquens Fhc complex (eq. 22).
Extrusion of excess formate or import from the environment might serve the balancing
of electron ﬂuxes in oxidative and reductive metabolic processes. Obviously, formate
movements would require an appropriate transporter, which is available in the genome
as a FocA/NirC-type formate/nitrite transporter (DAMO_2284).

General Conclusions
For a long time, it was believed that the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium and of
methane would be impossible. The reason for this was that enzymes, that were
capable to break up the N-H bond of ammonium and the C-H bond of methane,
depended on oxygen. From this chapter, it may have become clear that anaerobic
ammonium and methane oxidizers do exist and that their existence went with the
development of new enzyme systems that might involve subtle and elegant varia-
tions of metal-based catalyses that we already know from other, even completely
different enzymic reactions. In anammox bacteria, ammonium is activated into
hydrazine using the oxidative power of NO (see Section 3.2). In the N-DAMO
process by M. oxyfera, a modiﬁcation of a common NOR might have turned this
enzyme into a machinery with another functionality, a nitric oxide dismutase
generating N2 and O2 (see Section 4.1.3), the latter compound enabling M. oxyfera
to utilize the same pathway for methane oxidation as aerobic methanotrophs do (see
Section 4.2). While many details regarding their catalytic mechanisms still remain
to be elucidated, the novel hydrazine synthase and NO dismutase are extremely
slow enzymes. Obviously, the slow rate of these key enzymes immediately affects
the growth rates of the microorganisms, which is very low as well. These slow
growth rates, requiring dedicated enrichment techniques, may have been another
reason why anammox and N-DAMO bacteria have evaded our attention. Although
slow, the presence of the novel ammonium- and methane-activating systems
302
Reimann, Jetten, and Keltjens

provides the microorganisms with a unique niche in anaerobic ecosystems, which is
a central one in case of anammox bacteria [8, 11, 12].
Genome sequencing of anammox bacteria and of M. oxyfera, supported by a
beginning of the functional characterization of enzymes involved, has been sur-
prising and rewarding. A ﬁrst surprise was the genetic redundancy of many
enzymes that are related with central catabolic pathways [21, 26]. For instance,
anammox bacteria harbor a core set of no less than eight to ten different HAO-like
enzymes that are tuned for hydrazine and hydroxylamine oxidation, possibly for
nitrite reduction and still to be discovered other functions by subtle changes around
their heme c catalytic sites (see Section 3.3). In M. oxyfera ﬁve different NOR-like
proteins might catalyze NO dismutation and NO reduction, again brought about by
speciﬁc amino acid substitutions near the active sites (see Sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and
4.1.4). Besides these, anammox bacteria and M. oxyfera are likely to be goldmines
for divergent catalytic proteins and respiratory complexes, often representing new
combinations of systems that have been well-studied in current model organisms.
The putative novel bc complexes, new complex I-formate dehydrogenase combi-
nations and NXR systems in anammox bacteria [21, 26], and the REE-containing
MDH (see Section 4.2.2.) and formate dehydrogenases (see Section 4.2.4) in
M. oxyfera are just a few examples. However, apart from enzymes that lend
anammox bacteria and M. oxyfera their speciﬁc ecological position, such as hydra-
zine synthase and hydrazine dehydrogenase, many proteins are not unique for these
microorganisms. Close homologs are readily found in protein databases and in
genomes assembled by metagenomic approaches, covering a variety of poorly
studied or as-yet unknown environmental species.
In the end, anammox bacteria and M. oxyfera may stand model for a general
principle: There are no such things as “impossible” microorganisms. Each biogeo-
chemical process that is associated with a negative Gibbs free energy change ﬁnds a
microbe that can thrive on the reaction. Time, a plethora of protein templates,
metal-based catalytic mechanisms, and genetic toolboxes will allow the accommo-
dation of metabolic pathways to speciﬁc needs. Their uncovering may take time as
well, especially with respect to slow-growing species that are likely more the rule
than the exception in natural systems.
