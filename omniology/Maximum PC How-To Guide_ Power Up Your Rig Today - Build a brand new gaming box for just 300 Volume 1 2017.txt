a thing or two about a thing or two
I THINK MANY PEOPLE have lost sight. 
Whether it’s the insidious effect of iPads 
and phones, or something different 
altogether, we’re all starting to forget 
what our PCs are for. They’re not just 
boxes to connect to the internet, or 
expensive ways to play the odd game. 
They are so much more: a vessel for 
your artistic vision, a communication 
device,  the best way to consume the 
world’s media.... Basically, we all need 
to think a bit harder about the things we 
use our kit for. Thankfully, every issue, 
my beloved colleagues at Maximum PC 
and PC Gamer manage to come up with 
tremendous ideas, and explain precisely 
how to get this stuff done. You hold in your 
hands the essential mix of the past year’s 
ﬁnest tutorials and experiments.
There’s something for everyone here. 
I’ve written about game streaming—both 
in and out of the home—using tools like 
Xsplit, Gameshow and even Microsoft’s 
own Xbox app on Windows 10. If you want 
people to see how good (or bad) you are 
at ﬂicking a joystick around, we’ve got 
you covered. If you want better gaming 
performance, there’s a couple of options 
in here, from upgrading your current 
machine to building a brand new HD 
gaming rig for a paltry $300, all thanks to 
the effervescent, brilliant, fantastic Zak 
‘Deﬁnitely Did Not Pay Me To Write These 
Things’ Storey. Thanks for the entirely 
empty brown envelope, Zak.
Windows expert Nick ‘Ctrl-Alt-Del’ 
Peers has gone above and beyond here, 
showing us both how to get rescue-ready 
for that moment when Win10 inevitably 
seizes up and refuses to play ball, and 
also looking into the murky world of 
process management, giving you a 
slicker running PC and much improvesd 
knowledge of its inner workings. I even 
let myself loose on Windows, going in 
depth —and, if I’m honest, a little bit mad—
on the topic of application installations; 
if you’ve ever wondered how to remove 
software forever, or install things more 
easily, then shoot on over to p42 where all 
is revealed at last.
Lastly I’d like to thank our Raspberry 
Pi crew, whose dedication to making a 
tiny underpowered computer do amazing 
things is just wonderful. Even if you 
don’t have a Pi of your own, check out 
the tutorials towards the back of this 
publication, since there’s very little there 
that you couldn’t do with an older PC if 
you were so inclined.
If you like what you see here, a 
subscription to one of Future’s excellent 
monthly magazines is the best way to 
get more of it. Head to page 98 to get the

Upgrading your CPU isn’t about buying the 
most expensive chip out there.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS why 
we upgrade. They can range from the 
essential to the vain, from the aspirational 
to the vital. An upgrade may allow you to hit 
better frame rates in your favorite games, 
or give your system enough raw grunt to 
tackle a title that it couldn’t before. If you 
use your machine for more serious work, 
an upgrade may allow you to get more done 
in a shorter space of time, or even do things 
that you wouldn’t have been able to do with 
your current system. 
A reasonable rule of thumb is: If you 
ﬁnd yourself waiting for your machine 
to ﬁnish a task, then it could probably 
do with an upgrade. Whether that’s 
rendering a video, applying an effect to 
an image, booting, loading an application 
or website—anything at all, really. Your 
time is precious, so don’t squander it 
waiting for a machine to complete a task, 
when technology is there to help. And it 
doesn’t have to be a hardware upgrade 
that you need; turning to better software, 
or tweaking the software you’re already 
running, could also be an option—but we’ll 
come on to that shortly.
Of course, there tends to be something 
holding most of us back when it comes 
to pulling the trigger on constantly 
upgrading, and that’s the cost. Weighing 
up the beneﬁts against the price tag is 
just as important as working out what 
those hardware updates should be. If 
your budget can extend to getting the 
very best component in each category, 
then all power to you, but most of us can’t 
afford to maintain such an aggressive 
upgrade regime. If you know that you’re 
going to have to change out several vital 
components, then planning your upgrade 
makes sense—buying a graphics card that 
PRACTICAL ADVICE 
FOR UPGRADING
will still be relevant when you change up 
your processor and motherboard later.
Knowing what you want from an upgrade 
is key, because without that knowledge, 
you’re just chasing the next biggest and 
brightest thing, without taking stock of 
whether it actually makes sense. Working 
out what you want to do also enables you to 
focus on the component or subsystem that 
will have the greatest impact. Quite often, 
only you can really know what that area is. 
For instance, we wouldn’t normally 
recommend that you spend your time and 
money upgrading your memory, because 
for the vast majority of uses, 8GB is 
enough (or even 4GB, if you’re dealing 
with a much older machine). However, if 
you’re multitasking a lot, editing multiple 
4K images, and messing around with UHD 
video, then doubling up to 16GB or even 
32GB could reap real beneﬁts. 
PROCESSORS
Your CPU is at the heart of pretty 
much everything you do, so 
there’s a certain logic in coveting 
the very latest processor 
architecture, and seeing that as 
the magical panacea to all your 
computing woes. The problem 
with this train of thought is that 
more recent CPU upgrades have 
been fairly subtle in real terms. 
In fact, the last few generations 
have seen raw performance 
increase by just 10 percent. So, 
if you miss a generation, there’s 
not too much to get upset about. 
Miss a few generations, though, 
and those ﬁgures add up (such 
increases are cumulative). 
We haven’t seen any major 
shift in core counts 
for mainstream 
processors, and 
the frequencies 
have been creeping up 
reasonably slowly as well. 
So, even if your CPU is a few 
generations out of date, that’s no 
guarantee that a CPU upgrade 
will transform your PC. Indeed, 
as we found in one of our case 
studies over the page, a decent 
CPU from quite a few years ago 
can still stand its ground against 
newer chips in practical terms. 
There is a fairly major 
caveat here, though, which is 
that newer processors support 
newer technologies, aka the 
chipsets, and in terms of the 
bigger picture, this could make a 
CPU and motherboard upgrade 
a far more attractive option. M.2 
NVMe drives, for instance, can 
hit transfer rates of 3.5GB/s, as 
opposed to a lowly SATA SSD, 
which sits at a meager 550MB/s. 
Aim for a platform, 
and reap the beneﬁts 
of the latest tech.

Graphics cards 
aren’t just for 
playing games.
GRAPHICS CARDS
If gaming is something that 
interests you, you need a 
graphics card. If you want to 
play the latest games, you 
need an up-to-date graphics 
card. That’s pretty much 
the long and short of it. If 
gaming is lower down on 
your list, you probably don’t 
need to upgrade—in fact, 
you might be able to get away 
with the integrated graphics 
capabilities of your CPU. As we 
say, knowing what you want to 
use your machine for is key.
As ever with graphics cards, 
you need to keep your target 
display in mind when looking 
at upgrades. There’s not a lot 
of point dropping $800 on a 
GeForce GTX 1080 if you’re 
happy with your standard HD 
STORAGE
While processors and 
graphics cards get the most 
love in any upgrade decision, 
they’re not the only areas of 
your system that you should 
be considering. In fact, we 
would suggest that another 
component should be the focus 
of your passions nowadays, 
display, and don’t intend to 
upgrade it any time soon. Buy 
a graphics card that can drive 
your display(s), it’s that simple. 
We run plenty of graphics card 
group tests to help you make 
the decision on what graphics 
card is right for you, but just 
as with the processor market 
at the moment, there’s a good 
correlation between price 
and performance—if you’re 
serious about gaming, then it’s 
and here we’re talking about 
storage. If you’re looking to 
make just one upgrade in your 
machine, then upgrading to a 
modern, speedy SSD will make 
a tangible difference to pretty 
much everything you do. 
Yes, we know that it isn’t 
traditionally the sexiest bit of 
wise to spend as much as you 
can to get the performance 
you need for today’s and 
tomorrow’s titles.
Again, there’s a proviso, 
which is to do with using a 
graphics card for more serious 
work. Some applications 
can take advantage of the 
processing power of a graphics 
card using CUDA or OpenCL 
to improve performance 
signiﬁcantly—we’re talking 
computing, but the difference 
storage can make to how you 
use your machine can be as 
obvious as the difference 
between night and day. This is 
particularly relevant if you’re 
rocking a spinning hard drive 
as your main boot device, but 
also true if you’re going from 
about the likes of Blender, 
Maya, and Sony Vegas, among 
others. The problem is 
knowing which applications 
you use actually take 
advantage of which cards, 
using which API, and ultimately 
to what beneﬁt. Check out the 
software developer’s website 
for the application you’re 
utilizing, to see if there’s any 
advantage to using a speciﬁc 
graphics card.
a ﬁrst- or second-generation 
SSD up to a modern NVMe M.2 
drive. This in turn may require 
an upgrade to your system’s 
motherboard, which could 
lead to a new processor, new 
memory, and more, so as ever, 
it comes back to what you 
actually use your machine for. 
Do yourself a 
favor—upgrade 
to a modern SSD.
There’s still a place 
for spinning storage 
in modern PCs.

HOW TO 2017

SO HERE SHE IS, our upgraded 
gaming machine. From the get go, 
she came packed with a quad-core 
processor, 8GB of DDR3, a slightly 
ageing OCZ 256GB SSD, a 1TB hard 
drive, and the powerhouse that was 
the GTX 670. Boy, those were the 
days, huh? Not too old, we know. 
This machine was pieced together 
back in 2013, making it, relatively 
speaking, still fairly new. And it 
shows—the motherboard at the 
rig’s heart is still sound. There’s 
an M.2 slot offering up to 10Gb/s 
transfers, plenty of PCIe slots for 
additional cards, support for up to 
64GB of DDR3, and even onboard 
power buttons.
Aim of the Upgrade
So, the story behind this system 
was fairly simple: We assumed 
that the gamer in question was on 
a tight budget, they didn’t have a lot 
of cash to throw around, and had 
only managed to save up for the 
occasional lump of hardware here 
and there since it had been originally 
built. The last and biggest bundle 
being the motherboard, processor, 
and GPU combo. 
The case was old, probably taken 
from an ofﬁce PC from years ago, 
or a tower the grandparents had 
used for a while. The power supply 
was also old, and the storage was 
somewhat wanting. So, ultimately, 
we kept it simple and just upgraded 
the memory capacity and the GPU. 
Upgrading from Nvidia’s GeForce 
GTX 670 to the GTX 1060 would 
not only reduce the power draw 
overhead from the GPU, but also 
improve frame rates by well over 
100 percent. 
The Intel Core i5-4670K is by 
no means the bottleneck in this 
system—certainly not yet, anyway—
but we decided to throw out the 
old memory in favor of something 
a little more impactful. So, we

nothing? Two 
GPUs can 
yield beneﬁts, 
but they also 
increase your 
power draw.
grabbed two sticks of 8GB DDR3 
to ensure that we could both game 
and run programs from the desktop 
without worry.
Free Upgrades?
There’s a variety of things you can 
do to eke out extra performance 
here and there in a gaming build like 
this. Keeping your drivers up to date 
is essential if you want to improve 
performance. An unoptimized game 
can beneﬁt by as much as 20–30 
percent, purely from a driver pass. 
Couple that with a gentle GPU 
overclock, and you can easily crank 
those frames back up when you 
begin to experience problems.
Another cheap ﬁx is to increase 
the number of fans in your build. GPU 
Boost 2.0 automatically increases 
the core clock of your graphics 
card, dependent on the overall 
temperature, so throwing a couple 
of extra fans in the front of a chassis, 
or even on a ventilated side panel, 
should help keep your card cooler, 
and let it overclock higher.
However, if you’re concerned 
that your processor may be holding 
back your GPU, you can throw the 
multiplier up a fraction to see if that 
can alleviate the problem. If you’re 
running a stock cooler, as we are 
here, we suggest leaving the voltage 
alone entirely, and adjusting the 
multiplier by two or three at most. 
CrossFire Conundrum 
An alternative to purchasing a new 
GPU is to opt for a second older 
card instead, usually within one to 
two years of purchasing the ﬁrst, if 
you can ﬁnd one. This can be a good 
solution to save a few dollars, but 
it’s not without its setbacks. Firstly, 
SLI and CrossFire proﬁles aren’t 
always perfect. Generally speaking, 
on game launch, most titles simply 
don’t have support for any multi-GPU 
conﬁgurations. Which means your 
second card immediately becomes a 
paperweight. On top of that, it’s likely 
that you’ll end up with trouble in the 
power supply department as well, 
if you’re not careful, because you 
can easily add an additional 200W 
of power draw simply by adding 
the additional card. On the other 
hand, getting a more powerful card 
the ﬁrst time around, or a newer 
generation of GPU, will lead you to 
guaranteed better performance, and 
better power savings in the long run.

1  
CPU   Ultimately, we 
decided to forego upgrading 
the processor. The Intel Core 
i5-4670K inside this machine holds 
more than enough potential to 
handle any game or program we 
can throw at it. And if we really 
need to, we can swap out the cooler 
for something chunkier, and crank 
those hertz up.
2 GPU   Swapping from a GTX 
670 to a GTX 1060 made a 
whole world of difference. We 
opted to go for the 6GB reference 
variant in the end for this build, but 
the frame rate difference between 
that and the 3GB version really 
isn’t catastrophic. We saw an 
overall increase of almost double 
in every game.
3 Memory   Upgrading 
from 8GB to 16GB of DDR3 
for this build was purely a quality-
of-life procedure. Having access 
to more memory gives us the 
opportunity to run VOIP clients, 
Google Chrome, and recording 
software, all while running some 
of the more demanding AAA titles 
out there. 
4 Hard Drives  All things 
considered, the storage 
situation was pretty sound from 
the start. A 256GB OCZ Vertex4 is 
still quite a competitive drive, and 
backed up by that 1TB drive, it 
covers all your bases. We would 
have loved to have changed to a 
PCIe drive, but for a gaming 
system, it’s not entirely necessary.

THE RESULT
Well, it was always going to be 
a sure-ﬁre victory for the GPU. 
The Intel Core i5-4670K is still an 
extremely competitive core. In fact, 
unless you’re running anything pre-
Sandy Bridge, you’re unlikely to 
reach any bottlenecks with regard to 
gaming and graphical limitations. If 
this system was going to be sitting in 
the ofﬁce for much longer, we would 
deﬁnitely take a look at swapping 
to a more modern chassis, and 
potentially go for a newer power 
supply and better cooling, too—just 
to reduce noise and for peace of 
mind. That said, this is a system 
more than capable of gaming at 
1080p and beyond. Not bad for an 
outlay of just under $400.

HOW TO 2017

THIS IS BY FAR the more interesting 
build. In fact, its ancient and 
decaying spec sheet was still far 
more intriguing than the updates 
that followed. With one of the world’s 
ﬁrst six-core consumer processors, 
6GB of DDR3, and a prestigious 
Intel motherboard (yep, it still made 
them), this system managed to crank 
out some serious numbers even 
today, six years on. The hard drive 
situation was far less desirable—
with two SATA II HDDs, it was mostly 
used a web server, before ﬁnally 
being retired two years ago. Last 
week, it was a shelving unit. So, what 
did we manage to salvage?
Aim of the Upgrade
This was the biggy. We knew we 
wanted to upgrade to a more modern 
chipset. But a more modern chipset 
requires a brand new motherboard, 
and a new mobo requires a new 
processor, which requires new RAM. 
Like a cascade effect, upgrading 
one part meant that pretty much 
everything had to change. We opted 
to grab an Intel Core i7-5820K 
to replace the ageing Gulftown 
processor—it’s cheap, packed with 
additional PCIe lanes for future 
upgrades, and supports the latest 
X99 motherboards. Then we had to 
decide on the memory, upgrading 
from a tri-channel 6GB kit of DDR3 
all the way up to a 32GB kit of quad-
channel Crucial Ballistix Elite. 
Motherboard-wise, we decided 
to go for the EVGA X99 Micro 2. It 
looks crisp and clean, it performs 
well, and it ﬁts into our shiny new 
case well, too. On top of that, it gives 
us plenty of expandability going 
forward, enabling us to install two 
add-in cards if needed. We also ﬁtted 
a 240GB Kingston HyperX Predator 
M.2 PCIe SSD—not the fastest of the 
Ensure your 
PSU is rated to 
provide about 
25 percent 
more power 
than your 
system draws.
PCIe SSDs, but it’s cost effective, and 
easily knocks the old SATA II drives 
out of the park.
Free Upgrades?
There are a couple of free options 
on a setup like this. We took the old 
2TB SATA II drives, and conﬁgured 
them to operate in RAID 0 to boost 
sequential read and write speeds. To 
do this, go into your motherboard’s 
BIOS settings, ﬁnd your SATA 
conﬁguration panel, and change the 
storage type from AHCI to RAID. 
Upon restarting, hold Ctrl, and press 
I repeatedly to get into the RAID 
menu. Select the drives you want, 
choose the RAID setup you’d like, 
and create away. If you’re using RAID 
0, it should double your potential 
sequentials; and if you’re using RAID 
1, it mirrors the data on to the second 
drive, so if one drive fails, you always 
have an accessible backup.
Then there’s overclocking. Far 
more useful for rendering tasks on 
workstations than on gaming PCs, 
bumping the Core i7-5820K up to 
4.2GHz is relatively easy, and shaves 
off a signiﬁcant amount of time from 
your render cycles.
Pump Up the PSU
For this build, we opted not to swap 
out the graphics card. As it’s not 
gaming PC, but a content creation 
workstation, it was unnecessary to 
move away from a high-end card 
like the 5870 to something more 
modern, at least until we start using 
CUDA for rendering. That said, we 
had to consider that our operating 
requirements were going to change 
dramatically in contrast to the 
old Gulftown rig.
Using 
Pcpartpicker.com, 
we 
specced up the requirements for 
our new upgraded system (including 
older GPUs and hard drives), which 
provided us with a good estimate 
of what our overall power usage 
was going to be (471W at peak). 
You should always look for a power 
supply that provides somewhere in 
the region of 20–25 percent more 
rated power than your system draws 
from the wall. That way, you’ll never 
run it at max capacity, and PSUs are 
generally most efﬁcient when they 
run at 80–90 percent capacity.

1  
CPU   The CPU was the 
second-biggest change we 
made to this system. Jumping 
forward by ﬁve generations of 
processor technology has helped 
to push performance up by almost 
35 percent in contrast to the Intel 
Core i7-970 that was originally 
found in this machine. A very 
worthwhile upgrade.
2 Motherboard  And now 
the biggest change we made: 
the motherboard. Not only did we 
opt to go with an X99 board this 
time around, but we also swapped 
over to microATX in the process. 
This means we can choose a 
smaller, more versatile chassis, 
yet still retain all of the power of 
the X99 socket.
3 Hard Drives   Another 
massive change for our 
workstation is the upgrade from 
the ageing SATA II hard drive to 
the modern powerhouse of a 
PCIe SSD. Although it’s not the 
fastest SSD drive out there, the 
HyperX positively warps space 
when you compare it to its 
spinning predecessor.  
4 GPU  Simply put, this 
isn’t a system for the 
gamers—it’s a system for the 
designers, the CAD developers, the 
artists, the videographers, and the 
photographers. An expensive GPU 
simply isn’t necessary. Could it be 
used for gaming in the future? Of 
course, but for the time being, it’s 
far from essential.

THE RESULT
As you can see from the benchmarks, 
the biggest performance increase 
stemmed from the hard drive swap. 
Going from SATA II drives to a PCIe 
SSD, and using the SATA drives as 
backup storage is nothing short of 
incredible. Interestingly, after ﬁve 
years of processor development, 
Intel’s 
six-core 
enthusiast 
chip 
only beats the Intel Core i7-970 by 
35 percent. What’s important to note 
is that the price has plummeted. 
Other than that, this upgrade 
came together nicely. The HD5870 
was still more than enough for all the 
editing we wanted to do. In the long 
term, however, it might have been 
nice to change out to a GTX 1060 or 
RX 480 instead.

OTHER TWEAKS 
AND TRICKS
CASES
You could say a case is nothing 
more than six panels of metal 
holding the components of a 
system together. In reality, it’s 
much more than that. Cases 
are an essential part of PC 
building. Whether you build 
your own, pinch one from 
an age gone by, or go all-out 
and purchase a $400 affair, 
it’s something that every PC 
user has. But how much of 
an impact does it make in the 
world of upgrades? Is it worth 
upgrading at all? That depends 
on what you have. There are a 
few examples where swapping 
COOLING
Speaking of cooling, it’s 
always a good idea to evaluate 
your situation. Ambient 
temperatures are always going 
to have a dramatic effect on 
overall internal temperatures. 
For instance, if you’re stuck 
in Phoenix without aircon, 
your rig may very easily run 
at a full 10 degrees higher 
than, say, someone sitting in 
Chicago. With that being the 
case, you’re going to need more 
efﬁcient forms of cooling than 
a reference stock cooler to 
avoid thermals throttling your 
hardware. You can check a lot 
of this by running a few simple 
benchmarks, such as Prime95 
and Unity’s Heaven, alongside 
HW Monitor, to register just 
what temperatures your 
hardware is running at.
There are multiple ways 
you can help alleviate the 
throttling situation. Swapping 
out to a newer chassis provides 
you with more performance.
Graphics cards from AMD 
and Nvidia come with a new 
form of technology known as 
GPU Boost. This is an auto-
overclocking feature that 
increases or decreases the 
core clock speed, dependent 
on the card’s temperature. 
Depending on the size of your 
case, and the amount airﬂow, 
you can affect the temperature 
of hardware inside. It’s why 
blower fans and dual and 
triple dissipation card designs 
exist. Blowers can draw in vast 
out a reference CPU cooler 
for something more efﬁcient, 
such as Cooler Master’s Hyper 
212 Evo, will help ensure your 
processor doesn’t overheat far 
better than any stock cooler, 
and for $30, that’s not a bad 
deal. We also suggest you run 
at least two intake fans in your 
chassis to provide sufﬁcient 
airﬂow internally, to keep all 
your components well fed. 
If you’re thinking about 
overclocking to boost those 
Low RPM fans with high airﬂow improve temps and reduce noise.
quantities of air from a single 
vent hole, while the dissipation 
variety spreads the hot air 
around the chassis. If you’re 
not providing enough cool air 
inside a chassis, you’ll likely 
cripple your graphics card’s 
overall performance.
On top of that, there’s the 
ease of access of newer cases, 
with multiple 2.5-inch drives, 
better cable management, 
improved airﬂow, and support 
for a wider variety of cooling, 
motherboards, form factors, 
and more. So, upgrading your 
chassis can be very satisfying. 
performance ﬁgures some 
more, we would suggest you 
take a look at watercooling, 
especially when it comes to 
Intel’s latest chips. You don’t 
necessarily need something 
like a custom loop, but a 
single 120mm AIO liquid 
cooler, such as the NZXT 
Kraken X42 or Corsair Hydro 
H60i, will provide you with 
ample capacity to overclock 
any processor, outside of the 
extreme edition CPUs.
MEMORY
As DDR4 replaced DDR3 with 
the introduction of the X99 
and Z170 chipsets, it failed 
to impress many hardware 
reviewers, purely because it 
added little to performance 
ﬁgures. Indeed, memory 
speeds seem inconsequential 
for the vast majority of users. 
Improved capacities and 
lower power draw, though, 
mean we’re seeing overall 
wattage requirements 
plummet. And if you want 
to upgrade your memory, 
we recommend you choose 
capacity over speed, and get 
the capacity you need: 8-16GB 
for gaming and everyday 
tasks; 16-64GB for 
video rendering 
and 3D 
modeling. 
Speed 
isn’t a 
necessity. 
Chassis 
are slowly 
turning into 
works of art.
DDR4 performance increases are negligible, 
but with increased capacity, it’s a no-brainer.

MONITORS
If you’re not into gaming, 
upgrading your screen is a 
relatively painless affair. For 
professionals and graphic 
designers, the obvious route is 
to grab yourself one of those 
swanky IPS panels. Providing 
far better color reproduction, 
IPS and PLS are exceptionally 
useful for those looking for 
color accuracy from screen to 
printer. On top of that, there’s 
the argument of resolution and 
screen real estate. Bumping 
up the size of your screen in 
conjunction with resolution, 
to maintain your pixel per inch 
ratio while also increasing 
screen real estate, makes it 
far easier to work on multiple 
programs at the same time. 
Going from a 24-inch 1080p 
screen to a 27-inch 1440p 
screen is a joy, and well worth 
the time of day.
That said, on the other side 
of the fence, for gaming it’s 
a little more complex. Your 
screen choice is inherently 
symbiotically joined at the 
knee with your GPU. Choosing 
the right screen is dependent 
on what graphics card you 
have, what games you play, 
MOTHERBOARDS
Motherboards are by far one 
of the most underappreciated 
components in any given 
system. And it’s not 
hard to understand why, 
either. Marketing gurus 
throughout the industry 
have been promoting these 
“performance-enhancing 
pillars of computing” for 
quite some time. If it’s not 
Killer Networking touting a 
whole 200ns faster speeds 
than its Intel rivals, it’s 
efﬁcient capacitors, gaming 
technologies, and whatever 
else the whizz-kids want to 
slap on to each box to bump up 
the price tag. 
That said, once you’ve 
waded through the mire of 
marketing sludge, and got to 
the grunt of what makes Intel’s 
constant chipset updates 
more interesting than most, 
the whole concept is actually 
and what resolution you want 
to achieve. Working backward, 
if you’re looking at gaming 
at 1080p, the RX 480 or GTX 
1060 is a ﬁne combination; at 
1440p, the GTX 1070 or Fury 
more intriguing than you would 
ﬁrst think.
It’s the enhanced 
connectivity that really sells it. 
Take a look at Z170, compared 
to last generation’s Z97 
chipset, and you’ll see what 
we mean. Each generation 
sees improved support for 
a wide variety of connection 
standards. M.2 SSDs, which 
were so rare two years ago, 
are now commonplace, 
providing read and write 
speeds up to six times faster 
than any SATA SSD, and Intel 
accommodated for that. 
Marketing spiel aside, 
higher priced motherboards 
generally tend to feature 
improved onboard audio, 
alongside more efﬁcient VRMs, 
meaning you can operate 
higher overclocks and low 
undervolts on your system 
with ease. 
X is a perfect solution; for 4K, 
you can almost get away with 
a GTX 1080 with some lower 
AA settings. For high refresh 
rates at 1440p, the GTX 1080 
is the king. 
If you’re gaming, remember to match 
your screen to your GPU.

HOW TO 2017

WE’RE SET NEW CHALLENGES, of all kinds, all the time. 
Whether it’s via our executive editor, our editor-in-chief, 
or the management bods who want those big headlines 
on the newsstand, we’re thrown into the belly of the 
beast with a new conundrum to tackle. Every time they 
come, those challenges get more extreme. This time, we 
were sat down and told: “$300— that’s your budget. We 
want a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of memory. Do it!” 
And so here we are. Maximum performance at the 
absolute minimum budget. A base system that can 
operate efﬁciently and quickly, yet is fully capable of  
being upgraded to compete with some of the most 
prestigious mid-range gaming or ofﬁce PCs out there. 
But who are we if not suckers for punishment? Instead of 
one single $300 bunker-busting bomb, we decided to pit 
those two old processing dogs against each other—Intel 
versus AMD—in the ultimate budget build-off, to ﬁnally 
settle the debate once and for all (or at least until Ryzen 
and Kaby fully launch, and we have a whole plethora of 
new parts to consider).

QUAD-CORE $69
GIGABYTE  
GA-H110M-S2H

Intriguingly, we ﬂipped the boat 
on this one and went with a 
slightly more expensive AMD chip. 
Because we managed to neatly 
make some savings elsewhere 
in the build, we could splurge a 
touch more, so opted to go for the 
now-slightly-ageing 
quad-core 
A8-7600. Although AMD does have 
the X4 845 at a slightly cheaper 
price point, the lack of integrated 
graphics is a real deal breaker. 
We’ll be honest: We pinched this 
cooler from an A10-7670K, but rest 
assured, both this and the Intel 
chip do come with stock coolers 
as pictured, so there’s no need to 
worry about your chip overheating.
Gigabyte’s a fond favorite of 
ours, 
providing 
good-quality 
motherboards, jam-packed with 
features at a respectable price. 
Well, at least once you hit the 
$100 mark, of course. To even 
attempt to reach our allocated 
Intel budget, we had to settle 
for the H110 chipset. What this 
meant was a microATX form 
factor motherboard, with USB 
3.0, a single PCIe 3.0 slot, no M.2 
support, semi-acceptable audio 
(fortunately), four SATA 3 ports, 
and an HDMI connection as a 
backup. Not exactly perfect, but 
not too shabby either.

More budget offerings—this time 
from another favorite: Asus. The 
A68HM-K is a microATX budget 
mobo, primed with an FM2+ socket 
ready for any of the Kaveri line of 
processors. With relatively slim 
pickings on board, you net access 
to four SATA 3 slots, two USB 2.0 
headers, two PWM fan headers, 
and a very limited set of rear I/O. 
It’s almost plain sailing if it weren’t 
for the lack of HDMI connectors. 
Time and again, we’ve slated AMD 
for being too many chipsets behind 
its rival, and the A68HM-K makes 
that painfully obvious. However, 
budget is budget, and you can still 
equip this with dependable SSD 
storage, 16GB of DDR3, and any of 
the latest and greatest GPUs.

AMD. Although that has become 
somewhat diluted in recent years, 
it is still true in essence. So, our 
choice of Intel’s Pentium G4400 
is on the bottom rung of Team

two 14nm cores, Intel Iris HD 530

8GB (2x 4GB) PATRIOT 
VIPER 3 DDR3-1600 $46
CRUCIAL MX300 
275GB SSD 
$81
DDR3 may not be the latest memory technology, 
but it’s still more than sufﬁcient when it comes 
to normal day-to-day operations and even 
gaming. With slightly higher latencies, lower 
capacities, and increased power draw, you’re 
not losing out on much in contrast to DDR4. We 
chose 8GB of Patriot memory here, because it’s 
the absolute minimum amount we recommend 
for any new build, and Patriot is a brand that 
we’ve come to trust to provide good-quality 
components, along with a solid warranty. The 
only downside is that, in the long run, it’s not 
going to be as easy to upgrade with as the DDR4 
kit featured in the Intel build, because all the 
latest platforms are ﬁnally shifting across to 
the new standard. 
This is arguably one of the few places you 
could shave money off those budgets. Running 
a system off a single 120GB SSD has been the 
norm for quite a few years, but as both these 
conﬁgurations lack any additional storage in 
the form of a traditional spinning hard drive, we 
decided that bumping up the SSD with a chunk 
of extra gigabytes would waylay some of those 
storage woes later on down the line. Crucial’s 
MX300 series is a solid-performing, well-
priced range of SSDs, built by the respectable 
foundries of Intel’s partner company, Micron. 
With reads and writes well above the 500MB/s 
mark, this is well worth the cash.

Another circa-250GB SSD hitting the block

than the Crucial MX300, but no less of a 
performer. This budget-busting solid-state 
drive performs well into the 500GB/s 
range as standard, and comes at 
the astronomically low price of $68. 
Although that may look cheaper than 
the Crucial MX300, you have to bear in 
mind that you do lose an additional 35GB, 
so the price of the two drives is almost identical 
when it comes to dollar per gigabyte. You could 
always get away with a 120GB SSD instead, to

Eight gigabytes is widely regarded as the

should be looking at when building any new 
system on a modern platform. DDR4 is the 
go-to for any new Skylake-based system, 
and, surprisingly, 2,400MT/s is actually just as 
cheap as the 2,133MT/s kit. In reality, Gigabyte’s 
GA-H110M-S2H can only support DDR4 up to 
2,133MT/s, so we would be running this kit at 
a slightly lower frequency than its advertized 
spec—but, honestly, you wouldn’t be able to 
tell the difference, and it does provide you with 
some future-prooﬁng if you want to swap out to 
another motherboard later down the line.

EVGA has constantly impressed us ever since 
it ﬁrst launched its range of power supplies, 
because it provides some fantastic value 
options, all the way up to the most premium of 
Platinum-punching PSUs. The EVGA 450B is a 
450W Bronze-certiﬁed power supply, and is 
more than capable of supporting this system, 
even if we wanted to include an additional GPU 
later down the line. It’s a non-modular, ATX-
sized variant, granted, but for the price, plus 
the included warranty, and EVGA’s legendary 
reliability, this a is no-brainer for anyone on a 
tight budget.
This is the ATX budget case of choice, as far 
as we’re concerned. For $40, you net yourself 
a full-sized midi tower capable of housing an 
ATX motherboard, multiple fans to support 
cooling, 5.25-inch drives, and a plethora of 3.5-
inch hard drives. Unfortunately, there’s no easy 
way of mounting 2.5-inch SSDs, but with a bit of 
double-sided sticky tape, you can hide them or 
mount them on the ﬂoor or side of the chassis 
without worry. We’re using the Elite version of 
the S210 here (as NZXT doesn’t sample cases 
any lower than that), but the only difference 
between the two are the included fan, and the 
tool-less 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch bays.

It’s not the fanciest chassis out there, but for 
the price, it’s hard to ﬁnd much better. Fractal’s 
Core 1100 offers a simple yet somewhat 
antiquated design, ideal for anyone looking 
to build their ﬁrst system. Only supporting up 
to microATX motherboards, it does limit your 
upgrade potential, and the lack of cooling 
support beyond the front 120mm fan is a little 
unnerving, but you can still build a snazzy little 
system inside, without taking a huge hit on 
performance. The top-mounted PSU is a little 
old-school, but it does help improve internal 
airﬂow inside the chassis by shifting more  
air out of the rear, and if cooling becomes a

we wanted to showcase two separate power

difference between the two, though, short 
of manufacturer—however, brand loyalty, in

Rise of the Tomb Raider @ 768p
26fps
Rise of the Tomb Raider was run at 1366x768 on integrated graphics 
at the lowest possible settings. Average frames recorded in the 
integrated benchmark.
OUR AMD BUILD looks quite dainty 
compared to Intel’s behemoth. 
The microATX Core 1100 offers 
little room for cable management, 
though. We tucked a lot of the 
cables inside the 5.25-inch bay, 
while sticking the Kingston SSD to 
its side with double-sided tape.
We contemplated using AMD’s 
more price-aggressive and newer 
X4 845 quad-core CPU, but it 
lacked integrated graphics. So we 
opted for the three-year-old A8-
7600. Still featuring a quad-core 
processor clocking up to 3.8GHz, it 
should be a meaty choice. However, 
we had trouble getting it to clock 
any higher than 1.9GHz with 50 
percent utilization in most of our 
CPU-intensive benchmarks. It took 
several reinstalls of the chipset 
and some BIOS tinkering to get 
it to hit the mark, and even then 
consistency in other benchmarks 
failed on several occasions.
We were impressed with how 
well it ran in-game, though. Even 
with that ageing APU architecture, 
frame rates in Rise of the Tomb 
Raider (on low settings at 728p) 
were impressively comfortable, 
nearing 30fps, demolishing Intel’s 
Iris HD 530 graphics. All of which 
bodes well for the low-end offerings 
coming up with Ryzen, too.
Simply buying a better graphics 
card and throwing a larger hard 
drive at it may not be the best 
upgrade choice. AMD’s single-core 
performance has always held it 
back and can lead to bottlenecks. 
It’s pricier, but for gaming we 
recommend investing in an A10-
7890K 
for 
better 
single-core 
performance, on top of the 500GB 
HDD and GPU of your choice, 
bumping the upgrade price up to 
$300. If it’s a home theater you’re 
after, a low-end GPU might do you 
more favors, with an RX 460 2GB 
and 1TB HDD setting you back $140.

Rise of the Tomb Raider @ 768p
11fps
Rise of the Tomb Raider was run at 1366x768 on integrated graphics 
at the lowest possible settings. Average frames recorded in the 
integrated benchmark.
WHEN IT CAME to building this 
PC, the most important decisions 
revolved 
around 
how 
best 
to 
attempt the cable management, 
and what limited cooling you could 
achieve with the included fans. 
Overall setup was a cakewalk. 
A quick installation of Gigabyte’s 
chipset and motherboard drivers 
gave us a rig that ran smoothly 
with little issue. Getting the games 
up and running was trickier, with 
most erroring on ﬁrst attempt. 
We found we had to directly install 
the VGA driver from Gigabyte’s 
site, something we usually leave 
to Windows Update, then force a 
DirectX install on top of that. 
Choosing 
which 
game 
to 
benchmark was tricky, as we 
didn’t meet the minimum spec for 
a lot of them. Metro 2033 was our 
ﬁrst attempt, but upon successive 
crashes, we caved in and opted for 
an old favorite, Rise of the Tomb 
Raider (at the lowest settings 
and 1366x768). Impressively, on 
integrated graphics we managed an 
almost watchable 11fps in-game. 
Although that doesn’t sound like 
much, you could play some of the 
older classics at lower resolutions 
without too much of an issue.
In its current state, the Intel 
machine breaks our $300 budget 
by 41 bucks. It would’ve been 
possible to drop that price simply 
by shrinking the SSD and using a 
cheaper EVGA PSU, but we advise 
sticking with a named brand in 
case of power surges. That aside, 
for day-to-day ofﬁce use, it’s 
exceptionally good value for money. 
If you were looking at upgrading 
in the long term, for gaming we 
suggest grabbing a 500GB HDD 
and potentially a GTX 1050 or RX 
470, for around $143 in total. For a 
home theater machine, simply grab 
yourself a 1TB HDD for around $50, 
and you’d be on to a winner.

SSD MOUNTING
Along with some 
double-sided sticky tape 
trickery, we’ve also threaded 
the SATA power through the 
bottom of the 5.25-inch bay to 
keep it tidier. 
       
FRONT I/O 
ANNOYANCE
Due to a lack of any cable 
routing options, and a front 
80mm intake fan, cable-
tying the front I/O cables is 
a necessity. 
       
TOP-MOUNTED PSU
It’s a little old-school, 
but the top-mounted power 
supply isn’t too much of an 
issue—however, we would 
suggest installing it before 
anything else.
       
CABLE 
MANAGEMENT
Fortunately, the Source 210 
comes with plenty of cable 
management room in the rear, 
so we managed to route the vast 
majority of the cables  
out of sight. 
       
HIDDEN SSD
We actually managed 
to tuck the Crucial MX300 right 
out of the way in the 5.25-inch 
drive bay, keeping it out of sight, 
but easily accessible. 
       
FRONT I/O 
CONNECTORS
The only problem with having 
a microATX board in a full-
sized ATX tower is that you 
end up stretching the front I/O 
connectors all the way up.

HOW TO 2017

O
ne of the most stomach-
churning moments in any PC 
user’s life is when you switch 
on your computer to do some work 
or let off some steam, only to ﬁnd 
Windows won’t boot. You may get 
lucky—Windows 10 is smarter 
than previous versions, and can 
resolve certain issues on its own, 
but in many cases, you’re left in 
an endless reboot loop. Assuming 
Windows even gets that far.
If Windows can’t ﬁx itself, what 
next? Do you have a recent backup 
of your data? What about Windows 
itself? Of course, it’s perfectly 
possible to reinstall Windows from 
scratch, but that’s the best part of 
a day lost to restoring your PC. And 
did we mention your data?
The solution lies in creating a 
bootable recovery disc—one that 
gives you the tools to repair most 
Windows woes, remove malware, 
and lets you pull data off the drive in 
case you’re forced to bite the bullet 
and reinstall. In an ideal world, you’d 
be able to build a single rescue disc 
to cover all your needs. Linux users 
can smirk at this point, and bring 
out their Live CDs, giving them full-
blown access to the OS they know 
and love. Wouldn’t it be great if you 
could do the same in Windows?
The answer is: you can. In this 
feature, we’ll show you how to 
create all the recovery media you’ll 
ever need. The ﬁrst disc will give you 
access to basic Windows recovery 
options, plus allow you to reinstall 
Windows if all else fails. The second 
offers more quick ﬁxes to resolve 
common boot and loading problems, 
plus 
provides 
opportunities 
to 
recover ﬁles and back up or restore 
disk images. The ﬁnal disc gives you 
the closest thing to a Linux Live CD: 
a fully functioning Windows-like 
environment to work in, with tools 
to help you troubleshoot problems, 
get online, and even add your own 
custom apps to beat malware and 
perform other tasks.
The time to create this media 
is right now, while your PC is still 
working, so turn the page, 
and protect 
y o u r s e l f 
a g a i n s t 
disaster.

ur ﬁrst recovery disc is—as 
it’s always been—the humble 
Windows installation disc. Can’t boot 
into Windows? Boot from this instead, 
choosing the “Repair your computer” option 
when prompted. From here, you can attempt 
to ﬁx startup problems automatically, 
launch System Restore to try rolling back 
to a previously working installation, or 
even restore Windows from a disk image. 
Advanced users can dig deeper, with access 
to the command prompt, too.
These days, most of us don’t bother 
with DVDs, so it’s unlikely that you’ve got 
any installation media to hand. Let’s begin, 
then, by rectifying that situation. Start by 
typing “recovery” into the Cortana search 
box, then choose “Create a recovery drive.” 
You’re prompted to back up system ﬁles to 
it, which effectively creates a full-blown 
reinstall disc—you need an 8GB ﬂash drive 
if you go down this route. Alternatively, 
uncheck the “Back up system ﬁles to the 
recovery drive” box, and make do with the 
basic repair options—in which case, all you 
need is a 512MB USB ﬂash drive, although 
you won’t be able to reinstall Windows if you 
go down this route.
(Note: If you want to create a bootable 
DVD, you need the Media Creation Tool—
download the latest version from www.
microsoft.com/software-download/
windows10, and choose the ISO option when 
creating media for another PC, then right-
click this ﬁle, and choose “Burn disc image” 
to burn your disc.)
From here, if Windows fails to boot, 
pop in your installation disc or drive, and 
either make it your ﬁrst bootable device in 
the BIOS, or look for an option to choose 
the boot device at startup, choosing the 
rescue media when prompted—note, if 
you’re shown two options (typically “UEFI” 
and “USB”), choose “UEFI.” From here, you 
can follow the prompts to hopefully bring 
your PC back to life, or—if all other avenues 
fail—reinstall Windows from scratch.
BEYOND 
THE  
BASICS
The Windows repair 
tool is all well and 
good, but there are 
times when it can’t 
help. It can’t disinfect your malware-
infested drive, for example, and neither can 
you easily copy ﬁles from a badly mangled 
Windows installation, before formatting the 
drive, and starting again. If you want to 
protect yourself against either of these two 
possibilities, you need to augment it with 
something else. 
Most antimalware vendors offer a 
recovery disc solution that specializes in 
rooting out malware—see the box opposite 
for details about creating a fourth recovery

Live CD option later on in this feature. In the 
meantime, our second recovery disc takes 
things one step further than the Windows 
install disc. Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home 
Edition is free (for non-commercial use), so 
start by downloading and installing it from 
www.lazesoft.com/lazesoft-recovery-
suite-free.html.
Lazesoft Recovery Suite contains four 
key components, all of which can be run 
directly from Windows (even in Safe mode). 
Of course, we’re interested in building 
recovery boot media, so after launch, click 
the “Burn CD/USB Disk” link. You’re asked 
to specify the target version of Windows—
leave the default “DO NOT specify” setting 
applied for Windows 10 support, then click 
“Next.” Choose your target media: CD/DVD, 
USB, or ISO ﬁle, then click “Start.” Once 
created, check out the box over the page to 
ﬁnd out what sort of problems Lazesoft can 
attempt to ﬁx.

Lazesoft

using in case it can ﬁx 
your problem with 
just a few clicks, but what if it can’t? In an

complete Windows-like environment—one 
that employs the familiar point-and-click 
interface, while giving you access to a wider 
range of tools, full Internet access (being 
able to research error messages online 
could be a crucial step toward solving your 
problem), and more besides.

version of Windows called Windows PE, 
with “PE” standing for “Pre-installation 
Environment.” It’s designed to be run 
directly from removable media, and has 
been adapted over the years by various 
individuals to provide recovery discs 
that can give you the best of all worlds—
think Bart PE (based on Windows XP) and 
AOMEI PE Builder (Windows 7 or 8, but 
not 8.1 or 10).
One of the most successful PE-building 
tools is WinBuilder, and one user-friendly 
variant for Windows 10 comes in the form of 
Win10PESE. It’s a ﬂexible custom recovery

additional apps and tools if you need them, 
and can be burned to DVD or USB ﬂash

MALWARE RECOVERY DISCS
One of malware’s nastiest 
tricks is to cripple your PC 
so it’s virtually impossible 
to clean. The malware 
typically suppresses 
known security tools from 
running, plus locks down 
your system in various 
ways, such as restricting 
which websites you can 
visit, barring access to 
Registry Editor, and even 
crippling Safe mode, inside 
which most antimalware 
tools can at least attempt 
to clean up the mess. To be 
fair, Windows 10 makes it 
hard enough to access Safe 
mode these days, so we’re 
not sure why malware 
bothers, but we digress.
The solution here lies 
in visiting your security 
vendor’s site to locate 
recovery media that 
includes a special version 
of your antimalware 
product that has network 
access to update itself, 
then focuses on detecting 
and cleaning malware. 
Depending on the tool 
and the infection, you 
should ﬁnd any collateral 
damage has also been 
repaired, although tools 
such as Windows Repair 
(www.tweaking.com) and 
Complete Internet Repair 
(www.rizonesoft.com) can 
be used in Windows proper 
after the malware has been 
scrubbed if this doesn’t 
prove to be the case.
These tools are 
completely free to use, 
so you don’t need to be 
a paying purchaser of a 
particular package to use 
it. Just download the ISO 
ﬁle to the hard drive of a 
clean, working PC, then 
right-click it, and choose 
“Burn disc image” to burn 
a DVD from it, or use a tool 
such as Rufus (https://
rufus.akeo.ie) to create a 
bootable USB ﬂash drive 
from the ISO’s contents, 
if the vendor in question 
doesn’t provide a live CD/
USB creation tool.
Major antimalware 
vendors offering bootable 
recovery discs include 
Kaspersky (https://
support.kaspersky.
co.uk/4162), Norton 
(https://security.symantec.

FIX WINDOWS BOOT PROBLEMS
Lazesoft Recovery Suite 
offers a number of handy 
tools for ﬁxing problems 
with Windows, plus it can 
help you recover data, 
too. Once created, reboot 
your PC from the Lazesoft 
rescue media. You’ll 
eventually ﬁnd yourself 
at the main Lazesoft 
Recovery Suite, with four 
recovery-based options: 
“Windows Recovery,” 
“Data Recovery,” “Disk 
Image & Clone,” and 
“Password Recovery.”
All four options are 
largely self-explanatory. 
Before running any 
recovery tools, we 
recommend taking a drive 
image of your current 
setup, which ensures you 
can always roll things 
back should the cure prove 
worse than the malady. 
Select “Disk Image & 
Clone,” and choose “Drive 
to Image” to back up to a 
suitable external drive. 
Second, “Data Recovery” 
contains the full range 
of data recovery options, 
including simply pulling 
off regular ﬁles, as well 
as searching for lost and 
deleted ﬁles and partitions. 
“Windows Recovery” 
attempts to ﬁx your boot 
problems, offering a wide 
range of options across a 
series of tabs. There’s also 
a one-click solution if you’d 
prefer the software to try 
to diagnose and repair on 
its own, with an “Undo” 
button that promises to 
reverse any changes made 
if the problem isn’t ﬁxed or 
gets worse. 
If this fails, try the other 
options: “BootCrash,” 
“LoadingCrash,” and 
“RandomCrash.” Each 
one steps you through a 
series of potential ﬁxes 
to try, from repairing 
the MBR and restoring 
missing or corrupted 
ﬁles, such as Ntosknl.exe 
(“BootCrash”), to running 
memory diagnostics, and 
recovering the Registry 
(“RandomCrash”).
The ﬁnal tool—
”Password Recovery”—
promises to reset your 
Windows password if 
you’ve forgotten it, plus 
can reveal your Windows 
and Ofﬁce product keys, 
should you need them. The 
former option only works 
with local passwords—in 
other words, if you sign 
in to Windows using 
your Microsoft Account, 
you need to visit https://
account.live.com/
password/reset to try to  
ﬁx the problem.
the time to expand the “WriteMedia” 
section. If your PC has a 64-bit UEFI (check 
with the manufacturer), select the “Copy 
to USB-Device” box; if not, select “Copy to 
USB-Device BCD Bootloader” instead, and 
check “Add Grub2-EFI (x64 UEFI only)” 
to ensure it boots. Click the folder button 
under “Please select the root directory 
of your USB-Device,” to select the correct 
drive letter if necessary, then click “Copy to 
USB” to build your recovery drive from the 
ISO you just created.
TAKE IT 
FOR A TEST 
DRIVE
You can now test the 
recovery 
drive 
by 
booting from it in the 
same way you’d boot 
from the previous two recovery options. A 
menu appears—select “Win10PESE” to 
boot into your recovery environment. When 
the desktop environment pops up, you’re 
prompted 
to 
choose 
your 
network 
connection type, if one is detected—the 
default DHCP is automatically selected 
after a ﬁve-second pause.
You then ﬁnd yourself at a close 
approximation of the Windows 10 desktop, 
albeit one employing a more “classic” 
Windows 
look 
and 
feel. 
You’ll 
see 
convenient shortcuts to File Explorer, the 
Command Prompt, and PENetwork on both 
the Taskbar and desktop—there’s also a 
shortcut to Firefox, giving you access to 
the web. PENetwork merely launches the 
network manager, which should already be 
running and accessible from the Taskbar 
Notiﬁcation area, alongside other controls, 
including one that enables you to set a 
different desktop resolution if you wish 
(note this feature doesn’t work very well on 
UEFI systems—you’re likely to ﬁnd only the 
1920x1080 and 1024x768 options work).
Click the “Start” button, and select “All 
Programs” to see what tools and utilities 
are included with the vanilla Win10PESE 
disc—shortcuts to critical Control Panel 
and system management applets are 
included, as are a handful of ﬁle-related 
tools 
(including 
7-Zip), 
BootICE 
(for 
managing the boot manager), a PDF viewer, 
and some handy system tools, including 
Remote Regedit (for manipulating your 
Registry in case your boot problems stem 
from there), as well as access to the System 
Recovery options found in Windows itself.
These tools are all welcome and helpful, 
but you may be hankering after different 
tools and utilities—you may even simply 
want to be able to run a particular app, such 
as a word processor, while you try to ﬁx your 
boot problem. The good news is that your 
Win10PESE environment can support third-
party applications and programs, too. 
We say “some” because, while certain 
program installers work, on the whole 
you’re limited to portable apps, namely 
those that run directly from a folder. You 
can download these from the Internet (look 
under X:\Users\Default for the Downloads 
folder), but be sure to copy portable apps 
and key ﬁles to another drive if you want 
to keep them for another session—the “X” 
drive resides only in memory, which means 
it’s wiped the moment you reboot.
Lazesoft provides a wide range of data 
recovery tools.

ADD APPS TO YOUR DRIVE
Why plug in another USB 
drive, or download tools 
from the net, when you 
can embed any portable 
tool directly into your 
recovery drive? Once 
embedded, the tools can be 
directly accessed through 
Win10PESE’s Start menu, 
or via an icon in the Taskbar 
Notiﬁcation area.
To add apps to your 
drive, ﬁrst expand the 
“Apps > Portable” section 
in Win10PESE’s left-hand 
pane, then check “PStart 
and Papps.” Next, click 
the “Open Source Folder” 
button to open the folder 
where your portable apps 
need to be collected, 
each one inside its own 
folder. Once you’ve copied 
them into here, return to 
Win10PESE, and carefully 
enter the folder name of 
each app under “Directory 
of Apps,” plus the name of 
the program’s executable 
ﬁle under “Name of exe.” 
To add a shortcut to the 
Start menu, check “Start 
menu,” and then specify 
the folder (get this from 
Projects\Win10PESE\
Apps), and shortcut name; 
you can add a desktop 
shortcut, too, by checking 
the appropriate box. 
Finally, if you’re burning a 
DVD, rather than creating 
a USB recovery drive, 
be sure to select “Run 
from RAM” to allow any 
antimalware tools to 
download and process 
updates. Then create the 
disc in the usual way.
What sort of portable 
apps should you be looking 
to add to your toolkit? 
Two recommended 
antimalware tools are 
Emsisoft Emergency Kit 
(www.emsisoft.com/en/
software/eek), which 
utilizes two antimalware 
engines, and Malwarebytes 
Junkware Removal Tool 
(www.malwarebytes.com/
junkwareremovaltool) 
for PUPs.
Piriform (www.piriform.
com) provides portable 
versions of CCleaner 
(cleanup tool), Recuva 
(data recovery), and Speccy 
(system information). 
Another data recovery tool 
worth adding is DMDE Free 
(https://dmde.com), while 
a wide array of tools, from 
alternative browsers, to 
disk encryption, to drive 
health monitoring utilities, 
can be found at www.
portableapps.com.
Finally, if there’s a 
speciﬁc utility you want, 
check with the vendor’s 
website—often, you 
can ﬁnd portable builds 
buried away in the 
downloads section.
BRING  
YOUR  
OWN
Luckily, you have a 
number of options 
should you wish to 
build 
up 
a 
more 
permanent collection of tools and utilities. 
Portable apps can be stored on another 
drive—a USB ﬂash drive, say, or shared 
network folder. Access them via the 
Windows PE environment when needed.
A more elegant solution, and one that 
incorporates your applications directly into 
your recovery drive (with shortcuts through 
the Start menu), is to follow the “Add apps 
to your drive” box on the right. Also take 
the time to explore some of the other 
options that Win10PESE provides. Explore 
the various sections of the disk-creation 
tool; expand “Shell,” for example, and you 
can change the packaged Start menu, 
plus conﬁgure its appearance. Expand 
“Components,” and you can choose which 
Windows tools and accessories to include—
add the .NET Framework to support a wider 
range of applications, for example.
If you have a virtual Windows machine to 
hand using a tool such as VirtualBox (www.
virtualbox.org), use it to test your recovery 
disc—open 
“VirtualTest,” 
and 
select 
“VirtualBox Emulation” to set up a dedicated 
virtual machine to test the ISO ﬁle with. It’s 
a great way to check to see what effect your 
tweaks have, without having to recreate a 
USB ﬂash drive or boot from your PC each 
time. But do remember to test the ﬁnal disc 
or drive on your actual PC when you’ve got it 
working to your satisfaction, to make sure.
TROUBLE-
SHOOT 
YOUR PC
Your recovery discs 
have been created, 
waiting for the time 
they’ll be needed. 
Now your PC is refusing to boot, and you’ve 
whisked out your recovery discs. What to 
do? First, we recommend taking a drive 
image of the system partitions before you 
start attempting to ﬁx things. Use Lazesoft 
for this task, unless you have an emergency 
boot disc coupled to your existing system 
imaging tool (such as Macrium Reﬂect 
Free), in which case use that.
With the drive image in place, you can 
start to attempt a ﬁx for your problem. 
Begin with your Windows installation disc, 
to see if its Automatic Repair tool can get 
Windows up and running again. Make 
a careful note of any error messages if 
the problem persists, then move on to 
Lazesoft’s Windows Recovery component 
(see the box on the previous page). If 
Lazesoft’s ﬁx-it tools fail to ﬁx your loading 
problems, bring out the Win10PESE disc. 
Boot from this, then use the tools onboard 
—such as Remote Regedit—to try to ﬁx 
known problems. Don’t forget your Internet 
connection—use Firefox to browse for 
possible solutions to error messages, 
plus download additional software you 
might need, but didn’t include on the disc. 
This is particularly handy if you’re battling 
malware infections—you can track down 
speciﬁc removal tools, or locate your 
vendor’s portable scanning toolkit, should 
our other suggestions fail to yield results. 
Win10PESE enables you to run portable 
apps from other drives.

It’s out of the clean rooms and into our 
homes, but should you be running RAID? 
And if so, which type? By Chris Lloyd
THIS IS A 
RAID
In 1980, IBM’s 3380 hard 
drive cost $81,000 for the 
2.5GB model. For the same 
money, you could walk into 
your local GM dealer, and 
buy ﬁve Cadillac Eldorados. The huge 
cost of high-speed storage provided 
the impetus to develop something 
that could match these monsters 
for 
less—enter 
the 
Redundant 
Array of Inexpensive Disks, RAID’s 
original acronym. 
The idea was simple: couple 
together a number of smaller and 
cheaper drives to build a larger, 
faster, and more reliable unit. Data is 
spread across the disks to introduce a 
level of redundancy. The concept and 
the odd patent was knocking about in 
the ’70s, but the ﬁrst hardware didn’t 
arrive until 1983 (a simple mirrored 
system from DEC). The term RAID 
wasn’t coined until 1987, and it wasn’t 
until the 1990s that it found favor and 
started to be used in earnest, before 
becoming the staple of server rooms. 
The early systems didn’t prove as 
inexpensive as hoped, either, so the 
acronym was quietly changed from 
“Inexpensive” to “Independent.” 
Hard drives have now become 
much, much cheaper, and adding 
RAID to your home rig is well within 
reach. You’ll ﬁnd software support in 
Windows and Linux, along with basic 
hardware support built into most 
half-decent motherboards. The cost 
can range from next to nothing, if 
you have a couple of old drives on the 
shelf, to $1,000 and upward, if you’re 
after some serious storage. The ﬁrst 
question to ask yourself is: Is it worth 
it? Quickly followed by: What sort of 
RAID should you employ?

HOW TO 2017

IBM’s 3380 hard drive: an engineering 
masterpiece, and the size of a refrigerator. 
RAID 
comes 
in 
various 
numbered levels, standardized 
by the Storage Networking 
Industry Association. These 
deﬁne the way the data is 
stored across the disks. Each 
level has its strengths and weaknesses. 
So, let’s introduce the main contenders 
currently in widespread use.
RAID Level 0
Data is striped across drives—blocks of 
data are written in parallel on two or more 
disks. These disks need to be the same 
size, although unused space can be used 
elsewhere with some clever partitioning. As 
with all levels, the RAID array appears as a 
single volume. This level is built for speed; in 
practice, on a typical setup, a two-disk RAID 
0 gives you about a 50 percent increase in 
raw data transfer rates, although access 
times remain about the same. The size of 
each data block—the stripe size—affects 
performance. Options range from 4KB to 
128KB. Generally, the larger, the faster, 
although it increases potential wastage. A 
smaller stripe size can lead to gains if you 
have a larger number of disks, or small ﬁles. 
By and large, a compromise somewhere 
in the middle is best. Adding more disks 
makes the array faster incrementally, in 
theory. However, there’s a number of other 
factors that come into play with bandwidth 
limits and bottlenecks elsewhere in your 
system, so expect diminishing returns. 
RAID 0 has no parity or redundancy—if a 
disk dies, the whole thing is fried, and the 
more disks you use, the greater that risk. If 
you place performance above all else, then 
RAID 0 delivers it simply.
RAID Level 1
This level uses mirroring. Blocks of data 
are copied to multiple disks at once—
generally two, unless you really do expect 
to be unlucky. These need to be of equal 
size, and overall capacity is halved. If a drive 
fails, then you’ve still got a full copy of the 
data. So, after you’ve replaced the failed 
drive, and copied across the data, you are 
back to where you started. You can continue 
to use the array even with one drive down. 
Performance is pretty much the same as 
for a single drive, despite any theoretical 
gains. Read speeds can be increased, but 
this is down to how the controller and OS 
work; Windows can struggle to see much 
difference. RAID 1 is really aimed at data 
safety done simply. 
RAID Level 5
Now it starts to get a little more 
complicated. This level uses striping, as 
Level 0, but adds distributed parity into the 
mix, to allow for a disk failure. Data blocks 
are striped as RAID 0, and a block of parity 
data is calculated and written on a separate 
physical drive. You need a minimum of three 
disks, and you effectively lose one drive 
to the parity data. The parity blocks are 
distributed across the physical drives. If a 
drive fails, then the data can be rebuilt from 
the data and parity data. It’s worth noting 
that this is far from quick—it can easily take 
hours or even days to rebuild an array with 
modern drives. You still have access to your 
data, even with one drive down. Data read 
speeds are good, but the need to calculate 
the parity drags down write speeds. RAID 
5 is a compromise between security and 
performance. Capacity reduction is less 
than for a straight mirrored system, and 
read speeds are better. It doesn’t work well 
with a large number of small random write 
operations, however. This level used to be 
recommended for applications where data 
security was paramount, but times have 
changed. More on that later.
RAID Level 6
Much like RAID 5, but with double parity. It 
requires a minimum of four drives. Data is 
striped to two drives, then the parity data 
is written to the remaining two drives. No 
matter how many drives you have, two are 
effectively lost to parity data. Like RAID 5, 
the read speeds are good, but write speeds 
are compromised. The big advantage over 
RAID 5 is that a RAID 6 system can recover 
from the loss of two drives at once. You have 
access to the data, even while a failed drive 
is being rebuilt, which, like RAID 5, can be

The good old days.  
Capacities and prices like this prompted 
the development of RAID systems.
painfully slow. It’s the RAID of choice for any 
system that needs to be up and running at 
all times, because drives can be swapped 
out while it’s still operating. 
RAID Level 10
Also known as RAID 1+0. A nested array, 
it’s effectively a combination of striping 
and mirroring. It requires a minimum of 
four drives, divided into two groups. Data 
is striped across the groups, and mirrored 
within the group. Capacity is always halved, 
no matter how many drives you add. RAID 
10 can survive the loss of one drive, and 
without the need to rebuild from parity 
data, rebuild times are good. A second 
failure is not always fatal—if it’s the mirror 
of the ﬁrst failed drive. RAID 10 offers the 
advantages of RAID 0 speeds, and improved 
security over RAID 1. It is good with large 
ﬁles and streaming. The biggest drawback 
is the loss of half the capacity 
however many drives you add.
More RAIDs
That’s not all. There are dozens 
of non-standard and proprietary 
levels of RAID. These include 
other nested variations, such as 
RAID 5+0 and 1+0+0, and versions 
limited to certain OSes, ﬁlesystems, 
or speciﬁc hardware. However, they 
are all pretty much variations of the 
existing levels. RAID 60, for example, 
stripes data across two RAID 6 groups. 
It increases performance due to striping, 
and doubles the number of disks you can 
lose before a full data loss. However, you 
need a minimum of eight disks, and you lose 
half the capacity to parity data. There is also 
an interesting non-standard array called 
RAID-1E, which combines mirroring and 
striping, making a copy of each data block, 
useful for a three-drive array.
WHICH DO I WANT?
If speed is your thing, RAID 0 is the fastest. 
Others may come close, but for consistent 
maximum performance, it is the best. You 
also get to use all the drive capacity you’ve 
bought. The downside is the increased 
risk. Any unrecoverable sector is just that: 
gone for good. If any drive in the array fails, 
you’ve lost everything—time to format, and 
start again. The more disks in the array, 
the higher the chance. It does come into its 
own when used for very large temporary 
ﬁles, such as those created by image and 
video editors. You can run these from a fast 
RAID 0 array safely, because any data loss 
is easily reconstructed. However, given the 
RAID 2   This stripes data across multiple 
drives, but instead of blocks of data, it 
stripes at the bit level, complete with 
Hamming code error correction. High 
data rates are possible, but it’s complex, 
and requires large arrays of synchronized 
spinning disks. Now, hard drives have 
much of the error correction built in, 
making RAID 2 pretty much redundant. 
RAID 3   This stripes bits as RAID 2, and 
writes parity data to a dedicated parity 
disk. It proved to be not as reliable or 
cheap as other systems, the single parity 
disk being a major bottleneck. 
RAID 4   Similar to RAID 5, this stripes 
data at block level, but still puts all the 
parity on one disk. The large capacities of 
modern drives mean rebuilding the parity 
disk after a failure is a long, long job. Best 
to stick to the distributed parity used in 
RAID 5 and 6.
RAID 7   A proprietary level of the now 
defunct Storage Computer Corporation. It 
turned out to be a variation on RAID 4 with 
a cache. After unsuccessful attempts to 
enforce spurious patents on the makers 
of other parity RAID systems, it all 
collapsed around the year 2000.

HOW TO 2017

Sure you want RAID? If it’s just speed 
you’re after, a single, large SSD is a 
better investment. No hard drive RAID 0 
system will even get close. Of course, you 
could always add SSDs to your RAID 0, 
and go nuts, although SATA 3 limits the 
fun, unless you move to PCIe-based 
controllers, including the lovely M.2. True 
maniacs can go RAID 0 across M.2 slots, 
making read speeds of 3,000MB/s-plus 
possible. However, for sheer speed, add 
SSDs to your existing controllers ﬁrst.
If you just want to use a motley 
collection of hard drives more effectively, 
JBOD—Just a Bunch of Disks—might 
be a better bet than RAID. There’s no 
redundancy or performance increase, 
but no capacity loss, either. Your drives 
are arranged into one logical drive. All 
you need is a cheap compatible controller 
card ($30 is plenty). If you simply need 
more storage, it’s cheaper, and can use 
up mismatched drives. However, if a drive 
fails, you’re in the hands of data recovery 
tools, because the whole lot goes down.
If data security is paramount, then 
yes, RAID 6 offers it. However, it is no 
replacement for a proper backup routine. 
RAID offers good protection if a drive 
fails in action, and nothing 
more. It won’t save you from 
a hack, virus, theft, ﬁre, 
power spike, or accidental 
deletion. If you can cope 
with recovering the data 
from your last backup 
after a failure, there’s 
no urgent need for 
RAID—just get 
another drive, 
preferably an 
external one, 
make regular 
backups, and 
leave it 
at that.
Non-RAID 
Options
performance of modern SSDs, you 
are far better off investing in these 
ﬁrst, rather than a RAID of spinners, 
unless you really need the capacity. 
RAID 0 too risky? RAID 1 offers 
simple redundancy, but capacity is 
halved, and performance gains minimal. 
If a drive’s mirror fails during a rebuild, it’s 
dead. However, RAID 1 is nice and simple, 
and you only need two drives. If security is 
important, you can do better. RAID 5 used 
to be the default choice, but things 
have moved on. RAID 5 can 
recover from a drive failure, 
but it has become increasingly 
vulnerable to multiple failures.
For good data security, RAID 6 is 
preferable. That extra redundancy 
means you can have a drive go 
down, and it can still survive an 
unrecoverable data loss on a second 
drive. Sounds unlikely? Modern hard 
drives are reliable beasts, but even with 
a tiny chance of error on any one bit, the 
cumulative effect makes even a slim chance 
a real risk when spread over multiple large 
disks. A typical drive has an Unrecoverable 
Read Error of 10 to the power of 14; the best 
can even manage 15. Plug that tiny number 
into some math, and your chances of failure 
with a multi-terabyte RAID 5 starts to enter 
single-digit percentages. RAID 5 no longer 
offers the levels of security it was designed 
to give, and can’t be recommended. RAID 6 
means the loss of a drive to parity data—but 
think about how catastrophic full data loss 
would be. Given current drive prices, it’s 
worth losing the capacity to be safe. 
That said, RAID 6 is due to hit the same 
problems as RAID 5 in a few years’ time, 
given the rate at which drives are getting 
bigger. Triple-parity RAID isn’t far away 
now, although rebuild and data scrubbing 
times may make it cumbersome in practice. 
We could soon see the end of traditional 
parity-based redundancy.
That leaves us with RAID 10, which 
combines the best bit of RAID 0, the speed, 
with the best bit of RAID 1, the redundancy. 
It lacks the data security of parity checking, 
but is a good compromise between safety 
and speed. You do lose half the capacity, 
though. Which do you want? It depends 
on what you need, but if security is key, 
it has to be RAID 6. Apart from specialist 
applications, RAID 10 looks good—drives 
are cheap enough to stomach the capacity 
loss for the extra security and speed.
THE HARDWARE
A full-on RAID controller includes a 
dedicated processor, called ROC (RAID-
on-Chip), cache memory, and more. Many 
consumer 
motherboards 
have 
RAID 
support, but the abilities and quality vary, 
because they lack the dedicated hardware, 
pushing RAID functions over to the rest of 
the board, the processor, and software. 
You’ll ﬁnd the motherboard is limited in 
some ways, only supporting RAID 0, 1, and 
5, using whole drives only, no support for 
hotswapping, and more. Disparagingly 
called “Fake RAID” by the denizens of 
server rooms, they are usually much more 
inﬂexible than software RAID, without the 
beneﬁts of a full hardware implementation. 
If 
you’re 
thinking 
of 
using 
your 
motherboard’s 
controller, 
read 
the 
speciﬁcations carefully. These simpler 
hardware controllers work well enough 
in a home rig, but it’s worth knowing the 
limitations before you start. If you are going 
for the security of RAID 6, a more capable 
controller needs to be in your budget. It 
can get confusing working out exactly 
how capable a hardware RAID is, but the 
price of a controller should be a big clue. 
If it’s tens of dollars, it isn’t a full hardware 
implementation. A “proper” PCIe hardware 
RAID controller can run into the hundreds.
Running RAID in software sounds like it’ll 
compromise performance, but processors 
are fast enough now, and if you run without 
parity, a software RAID can be light on CPU 
load. Depending on your OS, they can be 
very ﬂexible, too—Linux take a bow. 
SATA or SAS? Depending on your 
controller, you’ll have a choice. Mixing 
types is frowned upon. SAS drives are sold 
as “enterprise” drives, and are technically 
more competent, and theoretically faster. 
However, 
beneﬁting 
from 
the 
extra 
performance would mean building a

Seriously, you’ve got it easy nowadays.
RAID is getting old. As drives get bigger, 
it struggles to cope. Rebuild times using 
parity can run into days, and reliability 
is falling. Really big operations, such as 
Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, have 
already moved away from RAID. 
There are two approaches to improve 
things: to build on existing RAID levels, 
adding triple parity, for example, or to 
get clever with the math. Enter Rateless 
Erasure Coding. This uses mathematical 
functions to deﬁne a block of data as a 
potentially limitless sequence. The math 
is ﬁendish, but means your original data 
can be reconstructed from any subset of 
the translation equal to or slightly larger 
than the original—effectively, all the data 
becomes parity data. You can practically 
pick your level of redundancy. Want it 
secure after four failures, or more? It 
can be done, as can fast repairs after any 
loss. It’s early days, but it is promising. 
Microsoft uses a version of Erasure 
Coding in its massive Azure data centers.
More immediately pertinent for 
home use is the development of new ﬁle 
systems, which have RAID levels of data 
security and the ﬂexible use of drives 
built in, rather than added on top.
ZFS (Zettabyte File System), originally 
from Sun, but now open source, includes 
many RAID functions, including using 
checksums, copy-on-write, dynamic 
striping, and more. It’s readily available 
on Linux systems. Btrfs (B-tree ﬁle 
system), from Oracle, is also available for 
Linux, and uses copy-on-write at its core. 
BeyondRAID, from Drobo, offers beneﬁts 
for a NAS box, although it is proprietary.
Of most interest is Microsoft’s ReFS 
(Resilient File System). It’s in Windows 
Server 2012. It will replace NTFS at some 
point, though it could be years before it’s 
the Windows standard. It brings many 
features of RAID right into the ﬁlesystem, 
with integrity checking, copy-on-write, 
metadata scrubbing, and more. Microsoft 
boasts that it offers hardware RAID levels 
of speed and data resiliency, and it has 
proved pretty capable on Server 2012. You 
can try it under Win 10 if you use Storage 
Space to create mirrored drives. So far, 
though, you can’t use it on your boot drive.
Will these kill dedicated hardware 
RAID? It’s doubtful—there will always 
be a need for ultra-reliable specialist 
storage, because some data will always 
be too important to lose, and some 
servers too important to go down.
The Future 
of RAID
serious hardware RAID. SAS drives come 
in at around $100 for 1TB. Best to go SATA, 
where $50 buys you 1TB, and $150 gets you 
5TB. Don’t forget to budget for an enclosure 
and cables if you plan on a large RAID.
Full hardware RAID systems expect 
TLER hard drives: Time Limited Error 
Recovery. If a drive encounters a problem—
reallocating a bad block, for example—it 
can take a few seconds or longer to resolve. 
However, your RAID controller is likely to 
notice earlier, and mark the whole drive 
as having failed. TLER drives take seven 
seconds to try to ﬁx the problem, then 
send a warning message to the controller, 
and defer further attempts. It enables the 
controller and drive to co-operate more 
effectively to repair problems. Without it, 
you might replace good disks needlessly. 
If the drive has the word “Enterprise” in 
its name, TLER is enabled. Otherwise, you 
have to check it’s compatible, and turn it on 
in ﬁrmware. If you’re running a software or 
simple hardware RAID, you don’t have to 
worry about TLER.
A simple rule of thumb is to use as many 
drives as possible. Due to the parallel 
nature of RAID, the more drives you have, 
the faster it is. If you are using parity, more 
drives mean that rebuild times are shorter, 
as each drive holds less of the parity data. 
The situation for SSDs is reversed, as the 
higher capacity drives are faster; although, 
again, it’s worth checking the speciﬁcations. 
If a drive does go down, you’ll probably 
want a replacement quickly. Best to be 
prepared, and have an extra drive ready 
and waiting. Remember: RAID really 
wants matched drives—not just the same 
capacity, but identical ones. If you don’t have 
one ready, you might have to compromise, 
or spend time looking for a decent match. 
SHOULD YOU?
Many RAID systems can recover from the 
loss of a disk; some more than one. Don’t 
let this beguile you into thinking it’s a safe 
place for important data. It isn’t a substitute 
for a proper backup. A power spike can 
still kill the whole rack. And you have no 
incremental backup, so if you overwrite an 
important ﬁle, it’s gone as effectively as on a 
failed drive. You’re still putting all your eggs 
in one basket, albeit a more robust one. You 
still need an effective backup.
Just because you can, it doesn’t follow 
that you should. Hardware RAID can get 
expensive and complicated fairly quickly. 
This is a technology that has come down 
from the server rooms, and can be 
daunting. Think what you want to achieve 
and why; RAID might not be the answer. 
In its simplest form—using Windows 10 
Storage Spaces to conﬁgure a couple of 
drives, for example—it is painless enough, 
but from then on, it can get tricky fast. It’s 
no magic bullet, either—there’s no such 
thing as completely secure storage or fault-
free operation. Still interested? Good. Done 
right, the performance can be intoxicating. 
Just don’t get carried away. 
The HP 462919 offers capabilities comparable 
to most consumer motherboards.

Once upon a time—
and we’re going back 
some 20 years here—
getting a program up 
and running involved 
little more than placing a few ﬁles in a folder 
on your PC. That’s all an installer did. Don’t 
have the right drivers? Tough luck. Find 
them yourself. Operating system not up to 
scratch? Go through all the hassle ﬁrst, and 
you’ll ﬁnd out that something’s wrong when 
you try to run your application. A dark time, 
but one with beneﬁts: Removing a program 
folder meant, usually, erasing all trace 
of that software. A simple scheme from 
a time when, however bleak things might 
have been, operating systems were less 
complex, and software depended on little. 
Try manually excising a bit of software 
now, and you’ll not have a good time; the 
typical modern installer is responsible 
for more tasks, and spreads the software 
much wider, and uninstallers are required 
to scrape off the remains of redundant 
apps. The installer decompresses large 
ﬁles, which have been archived to ensure 
an efﬁcient distribution size. It determines 
whether you’re installing from scratch or 
upgrading. It places references to program 
variables in the Windows registry, and 
conﬁgures other ﬁles to suit your hardware 
and personal preferences. It downloads, or 
upgrades, software dependencies—drivers 
and software frameworks that the program 
being installed may depend upon to run. 
And it does even more besides. 
To make things even more complex, 
there’s not one kind of installation package, 
though this won’t make a huge difference to 
the average user. You most regularly come 
across executables (exe ﬁles), which tend 
to use some kind of third-party program 
to get the job done, or Microsoft Installer 
(msi) ﬁles, which do the same thing using 
Windows’ built-in installation components. 
Others—the likes of .cub, .msp, and 
.msm—also use the Windows Installer, 
and are meant for patching or modifying 
components. You don’t see them often 
while using Windows on the desktop, if at 
all, although those who stray into server 
territory might get more familiar.
For all we’ve said, a complex installation 
method isn’t strictly required for every app. 
Many apps have been designed to run in a 
so-called “portable” conﬁguration, where 
their content is contained in a single folder 
and requires no installation whatsoever. 
While these are few and far between—
portable apps are usually small tools, 
although programs such as LibreOfﬁce are 
also available in a non-installed format—
they’re perfect if you want to carry around 
a toolkit of apps on a USB stick. And you can

Installing isn’t the be all 
and end all of software. 
Check out http:// 
portableapps.com—you’ll 
ﬁnd a vast range of apps 
that run comfortably 
from a USB stick without 
marking your precious PC 
even slightly. But what if 
your favorite app doesn’t 
offer a portable version? 
Most programs can be 
made portable using 
Cameyo (www.cameyo.
com), a system that uses 
the concept of a virtual 
machine to package 
up all the components 
of an application into a 
single executable ﬁle, 
either on your desktop or, 
excellently, online. We’re 
not done with installers 
entirely, however; in 
order to create a Cameyo 
package, you need to ﬁre 
it up, run the installer, and 
tell it when the installation 
has ﬁnished. It detects 
the changes made to the 
ﬁlesystem, and swallows 
them into its own virtual 
environment. When you 
then run the app, it ﬁnds 
the ﬁles exactly where it 
expects them to be, not 
even knowing that it’s 
running in virtual space.
Cameyo’s commitment 
to portability extends 
beyond USB sticks full 
of apps, though. You can 
run your stuff entirely 
online with its cloud 
hosting service (session 
time is limited if you’re 
a free user), or take 
advantage of its library 
of portable apps, all of 
which are ready to go in its 
online repository. This is 
especially useful if you’re 
using a managed PC—at 
work, for example—where 
you might be denied access 
to software you need. 
Register yourself a Cameyo 
account, head to the 
site, and (as long as your 
network administrator isn’t 
wise to it) you gain virtual 
access to some of the 
best free apps out there. 
Nothing to install, no trace 
left behind. It’s like you 
were never there at all.
Cameyo enables you to run 
full apps, such as Celestia,

We have no doubt that you’ve installed 
programs before. Taking you through the ins 
and outs of clicking “Next” a few times in the 
course of a traditional software installation 
would be insulting your intelligence. But, as 
you may have guessed by the extent of this 
feature, the standard way is not the only 
way of going about things. The regular way, 
perhaps, but not the best in all cases. 
You may, for example, have grabbed 
some of the rare decent software from the 
Windows Store, Microsoft’s poorly-policed 
den of application iniquity. Whatever your 
feelings on its content, it has a number of 
advantages—Windows Store apps run in a 
sandboxed mode, isolated from the main 
OS, which means that even if something 
malicious slips through, it can’t attack your 
PC directly, and installing, removing, and 
updating Store apps is quick and easy. The 
technically minded might avoid it, and there 
are other ways of sandboxing apps you might 
not know of (see “Sandboxing Applications” 
on pg. 47), but don’t underestimate its 
convenience. So that’s one alternative, but 
let’s explore some of the other ways of 
getting software on your PC.
BATCH  
MANAGEMENT
Sometimes 
you’re 
starting entirely from 
scratch with a clean 
Windows installation 
that you need to get  
up to speed in a hurry. Problem is, deploying 
a new machine can be a massive slog of a 
job. Collecting together the items you 
need is one thing, but running through the 
individual installation processes of all that 
software is time-consuming and labor-
intensive, particularly if you’re dealing with 
programs that include sneaky shovelware 
in their installers. One wrong click and 
you’re infested, meaning it’s not even a job 
you can do on autopilot. But there’s a tried 
and tested solution that has been dealing 
with all that nastiness for a number of 
years, and it’s even applicable if you’re not 
installing a machine from scratch. 
Ninite (www.ninite.com) compresses all 
that work into a single job, then deals with all 
the effort for you. It installs everything you 
need, preselected to your speciﬁcations, as 
long as it’s in the extensive list of supported 
software, without any hassle. Head over to 
the site, check a few boxes for your desired 
apps, and click the big button to download 
the installer. Run it, and Ninite automatically 
gets hold of the latest versions of your 
chosen 
free 
programs—which 
range 
from security and development tools to 
messaging and creative apps—and installs 
them in the background. They all end up 
CUSTOM WINDOWS INSTALL
Installing Windows from 
scratch, particularly if 
you’re doing it repeatedly, 
is an absolute pain. 
Although we’ve talked 
about ways of installing 
batches of software at one 
time in the main feature, 
that’s not your only option. 
If you’re deploying a batch 
of machines, you could do 
it using a system image—
essentially a fully installed 
version of Windows, with 
all the software you’re 
going to need, that you 
copy wholesale on to a 
new hard drive. Microsoft 
provides a tool called the 
Windows Assessment and 
Deployment Kit to help with 
this task, which includes 
ImageX, an application 
that can deal with the 
creation and deployment 
of system images. Find out 
more and download the 
Windows ADK at https://
developer.microsoft.com/
en-us/windows/hardware/
windows-assessment-
deployment-kit, and make 
sure you run Sysprep 
(included with Windows) 
before making your image, 
to strip out everything 
machine-speciﬁc, including 
Windows license keys. 
This is all rather 
complex and, frankly, 
quite redundant for most 
users. You’ll probably be 
more interested in having 
a customized Windows 
build on hand for those 
odd occasions when you 
need to reinstall your 
operating system. NTLite 
(www.ntlite.com) is the 
perfect choice for this; 
it’s a tool that helps you, 
yes you, create a custom 
Windows build, integrating 
software updates, adding 
the software of your choice, 
and even setting it to install 
completely unattended. 
You can use it to remove 
Windows components, 
too, meaning you end up 
with a streamlined install, 
and you can automate 
post-installation tasks in 
order to avoid that tedious 
early-days rigmarole. The 
free version is absolutely 
adequate unless you’re 
looking to use it for those 
IT manager tasks we’re 
trying to avoid, although 
don’t make the mistake 
of thinking it’s a way 
of avoiding complexity 
completely. Building an 
NTLite Windows package 
is a task that requires a 
good few hours and a lot 
of coffee.

in their default locations, and Ninite also 
ensures that those clandestine crapware 
boxes are never clicked. While you can’t use 
it for automatic uninstallation unless you 
opt for the pro version ($20 a month, which 
also gets you the ability to perform network 
installs), it does support upgrading; an 
occasional run is all it takes to keep all of 
the applications on your system up to date. 
PACKAGE 
MANAGEMENT
Although this feature 
is 
dealing 
with 
Windows, it would be 
a canny move to take 
a look at what the 
competition is up to. Most ﬂavors of Linux are 
perfectly capable of installing software 
from 
ﬁles 
that 
have 
been 
directly 
downloaded—however, that’s not the usual 
method. Linux tends to rely on a disparate 
group of package managers, small tools 
that can download, install, update, and 
remove software—thus dealing with both 
the hassle of ﬁnding it and installing 
anything else your machine might require 
to get it running. 
Windows 
has 
been 
employing 
its 
own under-the-hood package manager 
for some time, a Powershell app called 
PackageManagement, which is a fork of 
open-source downloader OneGet. It is 
bafﬂingly complex—mastering it is a task 
for another day, although if you’re intrigued 
enough to experiment, you can read more 
about it at http://bit.ly/2gstsvW. Better, we 
think, to start with something more user-
friendly and sweet.
Chocolatey is the delicious-sounding 
Windows analog to Linux tools such as 
Uninstalling is easy—and comprehensive—with IOBit’s tool.
apt-get, yum, and pacman, and it works 
in much the same way. Microsoft even 
uses its framework (which spawned from 
open-source app NuGet, just to add to the 
complexity of the software management 
family tree) as part of PackageManagement, 
which is a ringing endorsement. To get the 
command-line version installed, open up an 
administrative command prompt by holding 
Shift, right-clicking the “Start” button, and 
selecting “Command Prompt (admin).” 
Head over to www.chocolatey.org/install, 
then copy and paste the top install line 
into your command prompt. Let it run for 
a while, then close and reopen the window 
once the C:> prompt reappears.
The ﬁrst thing to try is, we have to admit, 
a little recursive. Try typing:
 choco upgrade chocolatey
into a fresh command prompt, and you’ll see 
Chocolatey’s interface in action as it heads 
off to see whether there’s a new version of 
itself available. There won’t be, of course, 
because we’ve just installed it. But if there 
were, it would download and perform the 
upgrade autonomously. Let’s get hold of 
something a little more useful now:
 choco install notepadplusplus -y
grabs excellent text editor Notepad++ from 
the Internet, and safely ensconces it on your 
system, forgoing any standard Windows 
installer. The “-y” part on the end of that 
command means you tacitly accept any 
conﬁrmations that might come up during 
the install, so it happens in an automated 
manner. Replace “install” with “upgrade” 
or “uninstall” to perform those tasks, and

a huge number of ways to use it via the 
command line. 
You may be more comfortable with a 
graphical version, however; use Chocolatey 
to install the package chocolateygui, and, 
once it’s complete, you’ll ﬁnd it in your Start 
menu as usual. It’s an easy interface through 
which you can manage the packages 
that you’ve installed on your system, and 
clicking the “Chocolatey” tab on the left 
leads you to the other applications you could 
have Chocolatey manage for you. The next 
time you need a piece of software, head to 
Chocolatey, type the name of the app in its 
search bar, and we’d wager it’ll be there.
SPACE  
MANAGEMENT
We’re 
spoiled 
by 
today’s 
enormous 
spinning drives and 
ever-growing SSDs. 
Space doesn’t tend to 
be an issue. But managing it really should 
be, both in terms of what’s there and 
where you’re putting it. Yes, Windows 
search can dig things up quite readily, but 
despite Microsoft’s attempts to improve it, 
searching on NTFS drives is simply not a 
quick task. However, if your ﬁles are well, 
er, ﬁled, you may never need to do a Windows 
search again.
Consider, before you do anything rash, 
changing your default installation directory. 
By default, most applications you install 
either nestle in the “Program Files” or 
“Program Files (x86)” folders, splitting 
them up between those that run natively 
in 64-bit (the former) and those that don’t. 
Logically, this makes sense; practically, 
64-bit Windows is now the mainstream, 
32-bit applications are entirely compatible 
with 64-bit systems, and there’s no 
reason to split them apart in this way. It’s 
just confusing. But during each program 
installation (bar those of poorly-coded 
programs that rely on speciﬁc directories 
to run), you are given a choice as to where 
you install your software. Setting up your 
own folder structure—say, a “Programs” 
folder, with folders within labeled “Music,” 
“Ofﬁce,” et al—is a great way both to neaten 
up your collection and ﬁnd out what you 
have installed when the Start menu begins 
to get a bit unruly. It’s a ﬁve-minute manual 
job that will make life easier in the future.
Desktop Windows isn’t nice enough to 
offer folder quotas for ﬁles in the same way 
its server-focused skew does. Quotas, as 
you might expect, help control the amount 
that users are allowed to store. Restricting 
yourself in this manner is a great way to 
make sure you’re cleaning out the dead 
wood regularly—if you’re forced to make 
room every time you want to stick a new 
game or program on your system, those 
tough decisions suddenly get much easier 
to make. As we’ve said, Windows doesn’t 
naturally support such storage handcuffs, 
but we can get around it with a little cunning 
and a lot of partitioning.
CHOPPING  
AND  
CHANGING
By splitting your drive 
up 
into 
several 
chunks, 
you 
can 
effectively 
organize 
your 
content 
and 
stiﬂe the amount of it that you allow yourself 
to hang on to. Why not give yourself a virtual 
D: drive for your programs, an E: drive for 
photos, a Q: drive for videos, and so on? 
There are secondary beneﬁts: You can 
quickly defragment your OS partition 
without worrying about the rest of your 
drives; certain malware only affects a 
single partition, leaving the rest of your data 
safe; and formatting your Windows partition

The Windows Store is 
clever. It shuts its apps 
away in their own little 
capsules, protecting your 
computer from rogues, 
and from the inﬂuence of 
anything untoward that 
may be swimming around 
your OS. Most standard 
Windows apps, though, 
don’t have this facility. 
Unless, that is, you add 
it yourself. Sandboxie 
(www.sandboxie.com) 
does exactly this. If you’ve 
grabbed something a 
bit sketchy and need to 
test it out without risk, 
you can install it within 
a sandbox to ensure it 
doesn’t get its tentacles 
in. Running a web browser 
on a family PC? Run it via 
Sandboxie to prevent your 
kids from downloading 
awful PC gremlins, or 
to stop your mom from 
inadvertently “upgrading” 
something she shouldn’t. 
Nefarious threats such 
as CryptoLocker are 
completely negated by 
running a sandboxed 
browser, unless your 
mother somehow works 
out how to store her 
important documents 
within the sandboxed folder 
structure—that’s behavior 
you need to curb on your 
own, though. Once you’ve 
set it up, you can open your 
sandboxes (through the 
app) as standard folders 
using Explorer.
Sandboxie can be used 
for free, though you get a 
nag screen after 30 days, 
and miss out on a few 
features only available 
to subscribers—if it’s 
something you use 
regularly, you can sign up 
for $20.95 per year. There’s 
a secondary beneﬁt to 
all this, too: Sandboxie 
tucks all of the data from a 
program away in a single 
contiguous chunk of hard 
drive space, meaning 
deleting a sandboxed app 
doesn’t leave the same 
fragmented storage you 
might get after uninstalling 
a regular program. It’s 
a very minor thing, and 
there’s every chance you’re 
not even slightly worried 
by the behind-the-scenes 
goings-on of your data, but 
a well-organized drive is a 
fast drive.
Windows Store apps are safe and easy to work with, if not, necessarily, very good.
to fully reinstall doesn’t mean a loss of 
your ﬁles. That said, as we’ve expounded 
upon, your installed programs are unlikely 
to work properly, thanks to the required 
references that get scattered through 
Windows whether you like it or not. Copying 
ﬁles between partitions is also slower on 
spinning platter drives, due to the physical 
distance the read/write head needs to 
travel between the split areas of space.
You might think partitioning is something 
that can only be done to a clean system. 
That certainly is the easiest way to make it 
happen. As you run through the Windows 
installer, early on (if you don’t choose the 
“Upgrade” option) you’re given the option 
of where to install Windows, at which point 
you can also chop your disk up, and format 
it as you see ﬁt. We’d leave at least 32GB for 
Windows itself—if you’re running an SSD 
and a magnetic drive in parallel, use the 
SSD for the operating system. Doing it this 
early is beneﬁcial both in terms of instilling 
an ethos of organization to your system, and 
for speed—Windows won’t need to shufﬂe 
itself around or be defragmented to make 
space for a new partition.
POST  
PARTITIONING
It’s likely, though, that 
you’re not going into 
this from scratch. 
And 
that’s 
OK; 
Windows’ own Disk 
Management tool (right-click the “Start” 
button, and select “Disk Management”) is 
all too happy to slice up the drives of any 
living system. Open it up, and you may see 
that what you thought was a simple drive 
actually consists of several partitions; we 
tried it on a laptop we had hanging around—
one that had seen itself upgraded from 
Windows 8 to 8.1 to Windows 10 to the 
Anniversary Update—and found a host of 
recovery partitions and other empty space. 
It might be tempting, seeing this, to ditch 
this wasted space, but without knowing 
exactly what’s on each partition, we advise 
that you tread very carefully. 
Find your main partition, or a partition 
you want to split, in the graphical 
representation. Right-click it, and select 
“Shrink partition” to begin the operation of 
creating some empty space. It’s here that 
you’ll see just how much you’re allowed to 
shift; so-called “unmoveable” ﬁles put a 
damper on this in a hurry, but this problem 
can often be sorted by (temporarily) 
disabling System Restore or running Disk 
Cleanup. You can shrink your main partition 
down to the individual megabyte, but be 
sure to leave a reasonable amount of space 
free on your Windows partition in order that 
it can accommodate system updates and

FINDING RESOURCE HOGS
Although we’ve mainly had 
our eyes set ﬁrmly on your 
hard drive in this feature, 
your applications don’t 
just take up space there. 
Certain programs can 
have a disastrous negative 
effect on the overall 
running of your system, 
and might even be running 
on your system without 
your knowledge. Task 
Manager can do a pretty 
good job of showing you 
what’s going on; hit Ctrl-
Shift-Esc to open it, then 
“More Details” to see a 
categorized list. Right-click 
the column headers, select 
“Type,” then click it to sort 
the apps in the list, and 
have a look through to see 
what’s running. Keep an 
eye out for things that hog 
your CPU, memory, and 
disk access, and look at the 
“Performance” tab for a 
graph of the usage of these 
elements over time. The 
“Details” tab can offer a bit 
more insight into exactly 
what everything in the 
“Processes” tab is actually 
supposed to do. Do a full 
reboot of your system, 
reopen Task Manager, and 
have a good look at what’s 
running for anything you 
wouldn’t expect to be 
there had you not opened it 
yourself. In all likelihood, 
it’s there because of some 
autorunning application, so 
head to the “Start-up” tab, 
and disable any items you 
don’t feel you need. This 
can often make programs 
load a little slower—
they have to load these 
components at run time, 
instead of them being ready 
when you boot your PC, but 
they can always be enabled 
again at a later time if you 
notice a problem.
Spying on running 
software can get rather 
addictive, and it’s fully 
possible to delve even 
deeper than the Task 
Manager allows. Try 
Process Explorer (https://
technet.microsoft.com/
en-us/sysinternals/

one of the Microsoft 
Sysinternals tools, to see

system in ridiculous detail.

virtual memory. Once the shrink operation 
is complete, create your new partition 
or partitions by right-clicking the now 
unallocated empty space, selecting “New 
simple volume,” and allocating your desired 
amount of space, repeating the process for 
each new partition you wish to create.
CLEANING UP
Where, 
oh 
where 
does the space go? 
An 
established 
system tends to eat 
up hard drive bytes 
somewhat mysteriously, and if you’re 
obsessive about watching your drive stats,  
you may be wondering what’s going on. We 
can’t tell you precisely, although there are a  
few obvious culprits to look for if you’re 
getting too low for that big app install. First, 
and most prevalent, is System Restore 
points. These have the potential to be huge 
on their own, but if you’re doing frequent 
installs, your Windows system may be 
making loads of them, and keeping a 
needless archive. Disk Cleanup helps 
you delete all but the most recent. To ﬁnd 
the option, open up an Explorer window, 
right-click your OS partition (or just your C: 
drive), select “Properties > Disk Cleanup 
> Clean Up System Files,” then head to 
the “More Options” tab. Disk Cleanup can 
also clean up temporary ﬁles and the like, 
although you may not save a vast amount of 
space this way.
So where are the hogs? The best way to 
ﬁnd out is to use a visual method, rather 
than poking through Windows Explorer 
poring over ﬁle sizes. For this you have 
two primary choices: TreeSize Free (www.
jam-software.com/treesize_free) 
and 
WinDirStat (http://windirstat.net). TreeSize 
feels very much like a natural extension 
of Windows Explorer. Install it, and it runs 
from a context menu; right-click a folder 
or drive, ﬁre it up, and it very quickly trawls 
through, and ﬁnds out exactly what’s inside, 
offering you the option of reopening as an 
administrator if any of your ﬁles are locked 
down. It then lists your folders by their 
size, with a handy bar graph indicator in 
the background. Drill down into the largest 
folders, and you’ll ﬁnd your ﬁles—you can 
right-click them for a standard Explorer 
context menu, but be careful not to delete 
anything you don’t explicitly know the 
meaning of.
WinDirStat is a similar tool, but inﬁnitely 
cooler in that it ramps up the visual ﬁnery 
to a huge extent. Give it a run, select your 
drive (or “All local drives” if you want to be 
unnecessarily thorough), then wait as it 
laboriously traverses your disk in search 
of meaty ﬁles—it’s certainly nowhere

SUPER REMOVAL
Uninstalling apps you’ve deliberately added 
to your PC is one thing. Hacking away 
the dead wood that Microsoft includes by 
default in Windows is another. It doesn’t 
look easy—there’s not even an obvious 
way to remove those horrible, redundant 
entries from the Windows 10 Start menu. 
At least, there doesn’t seem to be, but 
there’s a sneaky feature built in to Win 10: 
Right-click an unwanted app in the Start 
menu list and, if it can be easily gotten rid 
of, an “Uninstall” option is present in the 
context menu. But what of the ream of apps 
that can’t be chopped out in this way?
For this you need Powershell, the 
super-command line that’s bundled 
with Windows. Find it in the application 
list, right-click it, select “Run as 
administrator,” then type the following to 
remove (in this example) 3D Builder: 
 Get-AppxPackage *3dbuilder* | Remove- 
 AppxPackage 
This uses Get-AppxPackage to seek out 
the appropriate program, then pipes its 
location and information to the Remove-

Click a big ﬁle and check the status bar to 
see exactly what it is, and right-click to ﬁnd 
a context menu that will help you open the 
folder in Explorer or copy its path to your 
clipboard. Click a folder or ﬁle in the top 
left pane, and it highlights it in the visual 
view, or use the top-right pane to hunt down 
ﬁles of particular types. They’re listed, by 
default, in order of the size those ﬁles take 
up, so it’s a good way to discover the space-
munching culprits.
TIME TO  
UNINSTALL
Once you’ve found the 
monsters—or 
when 
you’re 
simply 
done 
with your apps—how 
do you remove them?  
You might be surprised, but we’re going to 
suggest that the best way to clean up an old  
app is by using Windows’ own built-in 
interface, which you can ﬁnd in the 
“Programs and Features” section of the 
Control Panel. Removing ﬁles using this 
tool automatically ﬁres up their included 
uninstaller (or, in the case of MSI-installed 
components, 
the 
Windows 
built-in 
equivalent), which should mean all trace of 
the app is wiped away. Make sure, if using 
this method, that you remember to check 
any boxes that also remove settings ﬁles or 
equivalent because, while they’re not going 
to take up much space, any redundant ﬁles 
you leave on your drive slow down indexing 
and basically irritate you no end. 
If you’re a fan of overkill and salting the 
Windows earth, try a tool such as IOBit 
Uninstaller (www.iobit.com). It’s available 
as a portable app from http://portableapps.
com (because if anything should be, it’s 
a tool that helps you get rid of installed 
software), and it’s a great way of making 
sure every trace of an app is removed. Set it 
to work, and it bangs through your registry 
and ﬁlesystem to ﬁnd ﬁles traditional 
uninstallers might have missed. If a 
program doesn’t appear to be installed—
as in, it doesn’t appear in “Programs 
and Features”—you can also point IOBit 
Uninstaller at its executable ﬁle, and it does 
its best to do an automatic uninstall. It’s not 
ﬂawless, but it’s pretty damn good. 
WinDirStat’s rectangular map is incredibly useful for ﬁnding gargantuan ﬁles.

Take a peek at the inner 
workings of Windows with 
Task Manager. By Nick Peers
FORENSICALLY 
EXAMINE 
YOUR PC’S 
PROCESSES
E
ver wondered what goes on under 
the hood of Windows? If your PC 
is running smoothly, doing its job, 
then probably not. It’s when things start 
to go wrong—your PC slows to a crawl, 
or non-responsive application errors 
keep popping up—that you suddenly take 
a keen interest. There are plenty of tools 
out there that promise to speed up your 
computer, ﬁx errors, and make things as 
good as new again (whatever that means), 
but there’s always an element of risk 
involved in trusting your PC to a program 
that doesn’t really explain what it’s doing, 
failing to point out that cleaning out the 
Registry doesn’t—on its own, at any rate 
—speed things up, and, more often than 
not, introduces problems you later can’t 
unpick to resolve without a refresh or, 
worse still, full-blown reinstall.
We may live in a post-truth world, but 
your PC doesn’t care about any of that. 
Knowledge is power, and understanding 
how Windows works arms you with the 
insights you need to make more informed 
choices about what to do the next time 
your PC decides to slow to a crawl. In this 
feature, we’re going to take a close look 
at the programs, processes, handles, and 
threads that make up the bulk of what 
your PC does. And if all that sounds like 
gobbledegook, don’t worry, because we’ll 
also explain how everything ﬁts together 
to help you understand exactly what’s 
going on. 
We kick things off by having a look at 
Windows 10’s powerful Task Manager 
tool to take a closer peek—you’ll even 
learn a clever trick that can sometimes 
help bring frozen applications back to life. 
And if you want to go deeper, we’ll take 
you on a tour of Process Explorer, which 
offers a forensic look at exactly what’s 
going on—both in the foreground and 
behind the scenes. You’ll discover how 
to free up system resources, track down 
troublesome processes, and generally 
keep your PC running a bit more smoothly.
We’ll also take a brief look at some 
other tools that can help you monitor your 
PC and track down ﬁxes to your problems. 
But enough natter—it’s time to arm 
yourself with the tools and techniques you 
need to better understand your PC.

HOW TO 2017

T
he main focus of our feature is the 
programs and processes that are 
running 
whenever 
you’re 
using 
Windows. These include apps, games, and 
other programs you launch yourself, as 
well as background processes, such as 
Windows Services, your security software’s 
auto-protect 
features, 
and 
Windows 
Explorer itself. Windows ships with its own 
built-in tool for monitoring and—to some 
degree—managing all of these in the form 
of Task Manager.
Task Manager has evolved into quite 
a powerful tool in recent versions of 
Windows—launch it by right-clicking the 
Taskbar. The default basic view merely 
shows running programs—right-click to 
close it or switch to that program (handy if 
it’s hidden from view). Note that the “Always 
on top” option merely ensures that the 
Task Manager window can’t be hidden by 
other windows.
To tap into Task Manager’s full range of 
features, click “More details,” which splits 
things into a multi-tabbed view. The main 
tab is “Processes,” an expanded view of all 
the processes and threads running on your 
PC. By default, these are split into three 
groups: apps are programs you launch from 
Windows Explorer; background processes 
are third-party programs running in the 
background, and Windows processes refer 
to core processes related to Windows.
You’ll see four additional columns of 
information, labeled “CPU,” “Memory,” 
“Disk,” and “Network.” These represent 
the process’s usage (as a percentage in 
CPU terms). You can quickly see which 
processes are hogging system resources 
by clicking any of the columns to sort the list 
accordingly. Once identiﬁed, you can decide 
whether or not to close the program or 
process in question—if you don’t recognize 
its name, right-click it, and choose 
“Properties > Details” for a more verbose 
description, or choose “Search online” to 
search Bing for both the process name and 
its underlying ﬁlename.
Tip: Cloud storage apps often hog 
all available network resources, which in 
turn can result in sluggish performance. 
Once veriﬁed as the culprit in Task Manager, 
open their settings, and look for a section 
where you can apply limits to their upload 
and download speeds—OneDrive users 
should go to “Settings > Network tab,” 
for example.
Recover Frozen Apps
If a program is not responding, the process 
should be highlighted—from here, you can 
attempt to close it by selecting the process 
and clicking the “End task” button. If that’s 
too drastic a step, you may be able to 
recover it by right-clicking and choosing “Go 
Windows 10’s Task Manager provides a decent system overview.
Programs, 
processes, 
handles, 
and 
threads—what are they, and how do 
they link together? It can get confusing, 
particularly given the way that both Task 
Manager and System Explorer present 
running programs, processes, and threads.
Programs are a series of ﬁles that are 
combined to provide you with the tools and 
functionality you use on a daily basis, from a 
web browser or ofﬁce package to your game 
collection. They can also include underlying 
Windows programs (such as File Explorer) 
and lower level Services, which work in 
the background to provide features such as 
networking and automatic updates.
Processes provide resources to run 
a program, which are stored in “virtual 
address space,” a reserved portion of RAM. 
They comprise the program, open “handles” 
to system objects, which determine what 
resources are required (such as DLL 
ﬁles), as well as environment variables. 
Processes are assigned a security context, 
which determines their level of access to 
the system, plus a unique process identiﬁer 
(PID). They’re also assigned a priority class, 
which determines how fast the process runs 
in relation to other processes. Minimum 
and maximum “working set sizes” are also 
applied, to set limits on how much physical 
memory the process requires.
Each process is split into threads, 
which allows Windows to allocate CPU 
time between processes. Each thread can 
execute any part of the process’s code, 
and shares the process’s virtual address 
space and resources. They have their own 
properties, such as unique identiﬁers and 
exception handlers, and they stop and start 
to a schedule, so they don’t all run at once.

to details.” This takes you to the “Details” 
tab, where processes are listed with more 
information—their 
status 
(running 
or 
suspended), the user who launched them 
(typically you, SYSTEM, or a SERVICE), and 
a PID (Process ID).
To try to free up a non-responding thread 
from here, right-click it again, and choose 
“Analyze wait chain.” This lists any threads 
that are using or waiting to use resources 
being used elsewhere. Ending the thread 
may be enough to free up the original 
process—we’ve done this a few times in 
Firefox when an individual tab has become 
non-responsive, for example.
There are some other handy options 
under the “Details” tab—you can alter 
thread priorities here, which in turn can 
stop particular processes from taking over 
your PC, and slowing everything else down. 
Simply right-click the offending process, 
and choose “Set Priority > Below Normal” 
to see whether it helps. You can also give 
threads more priority if you feel they need 
extra attention, but avoid giving any thread 
“Realtime” priority, because it brings 
Windows grinding to a halt.
Another option is “Set afﬁnity.” This 
determines which processor cores a 
program or service can use—if you have 
a dual-core CPU or better, you might ﬁnd 
older applications designed in the era of 
single-core processing run better if you limit 
their access to a speciﬁc core, rather than 
allowing them to use all available cores. In 
most cases, you’ll ﬁnd Windows is perfectly 
capable of assigning resources efﬁciently, 
so it’s of largely academic interest only.
Trim Startup
One other Task Manager tab is worthy of 
attention: “Start-up.” This doesn’t just 
list which programs are set to start with 
Windows—it provides a “Start-up impact” 
tab that rates apps’ resource usage as 
“High,” “Medium,” or “Low.” Keep an eye 
on those rated “High”—if start-up times 
and overall performance suffer, preventing 
these from starting with Windows (right-
click the program and choose “Disable”) 
may help improve matters.
Task Manager’s other tabs enable you to 
monitor performance over time via a series 
of graphs (“Performance”), plus keep 
an eye on apps you’ve installed through 
the Microsoft Store by measuring their 
resource usage over time (“App history”). 
The “Users” tab is handy when two or more 
users are logged on at once, providing a 
list of user-generated running processes. 
Finally, “Services” provides a cut-down 
version of which low-level processes are 
running (or not). You can manually start, 
stop, and restart services from here, but 
for more granular control (such as setting 
a Service’s start-up setting), right-click the 
service, and choose “Open Services.”
Process Explorer
The Windows 10 Task Manager tool goes 
a long way to giving you a peek inside your 
system, as well as the tools for dealing with 
runaway and non-responding programs, 
processes, and threads. But you can 
delve even deeper into your system with 
the help of Process Explorer, a free tool 
developed 
by 
Microsoft’s 
Sysinternals 
team. Find out more and download it from 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/
sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx—it’s 
completely portable, and can be run directly 
from your web browser (go to https://live.
sysinternals.com/procexp.exe to do so).
We’ll assume you’re downloading it: once 
done, right-click “ProcessExplorer.zip,”  
choose “Properties,” check “Unblock,” 
and click “OK.” Now extract its contents, 
then 
right-click 
either 
“procexp.exe” 
or “procexp64.exe” (depending on your 
Windows system type), and choose “Run as 
administrator.” Process Explorer doesn’t 
require elevated access, but if you want a 
complete look at your system, you should 
do so to allow it to peer wherever it needs to.
Process Explorer opens to a single-
pane window. Expand the “Options” menu, 
and check “Hide When Minimized” and 
“Allow Only One Instance.” The former 
option ensures that when you close or 
hide Process Explorer, it minimizes to the 
Taskbar Notiﬁcation area, where a real-
time graph lets you keep an eye on CPU 
usage (roll your mouse over it, and a pop-up 
window reveals overall CPU usage, as well 
as that of the most demanding app running). 
Go to “Options > Tray Icons” to measure 
additional metrics via their own system tray 
icons, with seven choices on offer, including 
“GPU 
memory” 
and 
“Commit” 
(total 
predicted memory the system may need at 
any one time based on current usage).

Process Explorer can also help 
track down potential security 
risks that are running, by 
comparing a process’s parent 
ﬁle with the VirusTotal online 
database, which checks ﬁles 
against dozens of reputable 
antivirus engines. Switch the 
feature on by choosing “Options 
> VirusTotal.com > Check 
VirusTotal.com.” Click “Yes” to 
agree to the VirusTotal terms 
of service (these are displayed 
in your browser), and then 
Process Explorer will submit 
the hashes of every running 
process and thread to the 
VirusTotal website. It also adds 
a new VirusTotal column to the 
main view. You’ll see a list of 
clickable links reading “0/56” 
or “3/57.” Each one links to the 
antivirus scan results for that 
individual ﬁle. 
Any ﬁles listed as “0/57” or 
similar have been rated safe by 
all the antivirus engines used; 
focus your efforts on those 
marked in red, where the score 
is 1 or higher. Click the link 
and you’re taken to a web page 
of results, with the suspected 
infections placed prominently 
at the top, along with the source 
antivirus engine and suspected 
infection. Google the result, 
together with the ﬁlename, to 
see what’s out there, but unless 
there are multiple matches, it’s 
likely to be a false positive.
If 
your 
ﬁle 
isn’t 
listed 
there, that means it hasn’t yet 
been scanned by VirusTotal’s 
engines—right-click the ﬁle and 
choose “Submit to VirusTotal” to 
upload it, then wait for it to be 
scanned. The results appear in 
due course.
You can also check ﬁles 
for their digital signatures— 
double-click the process and 
switch to the “Image” tab, then 
click the “Verify” button. Look 
for “(Veriﬁed),” followed by the 
name of the digital certiﬁcate 
authority under “Image File.” 
This, on its own, is no guarantee 
of whether or not a ﬁle is 
safe, but it is an extra layer 
of security.
Check for Malware
The more ﬂags on VirusTotal, the more dangerous the ﬁle.
processes. You’ll see some processes 
are nested inside others in a tree-like 
structure. This makes it clear from which 
process a particular process or program 
spawned (for example, if you open a 
program in the usual way, it appears nested 
underneath explorer.exe; however, if you 
open your web browser by clicking a link in 
another program—Word, say—it appears 
underneath the parent program instead). 
Processes are also color-coded to 
help you identify what’s going on with 
each—to see what the colors represent, 
from recently launched threads (green) to 
threads ending (red), choose “Options > 
Conﬁgure Colors.”
Note this view is lost if you click any 
of the other column headings—such as 
“CPU”—to determine resource hogs. But 
if you double-click the process to open its 
Properties dialog, you can see the name of 
its parent process underneath the “Image” 
tab with other useful information (such as 
which user the process is running under).
As an aside, look carefully at the System 
process. You’ll see an entry marked 
“Interrupts.” This is an artiﬁcial process 
in that it actually tracks the system’s 
interaction with your hardware. If you spot 
high CPU consumption for this ﬁgure, 
then it indicates a potential problem with 
your hardware or—more likely—a driver 
bug. Don’t bother clicking it for further 
information, though—there’s nothing to 
see, literally.

Explorer enables you to see what’s really

happening under the hood is through its 
support for showing detailed information 
about a process’s threads. Switch to the 
“Thread tab”—ignoring the warning about 
missing symbol ﬁles (not needed unless 
you’ve got the chops to go the extra mile, 
or you’re a developer)—and you’ll see a list 
of all threads associated with that process. 
You get to see the CPU usage for individual 
threads, as well as the ﬁles calling 
that thread, which helps pinpoint where a 
resource leak may be occurring. You can 
kill or suspend individual threads from this 
dialog box, but save any work before doing 
so—you could easily bring down the parent 
process from here, or even Windows itself if 
you don’t know what you’re doing.
A process’s “Properties” dialog contains 
a wealth of potentially helpful information. 
Use the “Performance” and “Performance 
Graph” tabs to measure its impact over 
time, for example. Switch to the “Service” 
tab to list which services it utilizes, or select 
“Environment” to view any environmental 
variables used by the program. The 
“Strings” tab is linked to the list of values 
provided by any DLL ﬁles used—these can 
help identify a process if you’re struggling 
to work out what it relates to.
Handles and DLL Files
Process Explorer also enables you to 
take a close look at a process’s handles 
and DLL ﬁles (the resource ﬁles that can 
be shared between multiple programs). 
Select your thread and press Ctrl-H—a 
new pane appears listing its handles. From 
here, double-click a handle to get more 
information about it (most speciﬁcally, a 
description of the handle type, such as 
“Section” or “WindowStation.”) It’s possible 
to close individual handles by right-clicking 
and choosing the “Close” option—but, as 
with threads, if you don’t know what you’re 
doing, it’s likely you’ll bring the whole 
process crashing down.
Press Ctrl-D, and this lower pane 
switches to DLL view, listing all the 
DLL ﬁles that the process in question is 
accessing. Double-click a DLL ﬁle to access 
its properties—switch to the “Strings” tab 
and you’re shown a list of string values it 
contains. Press Ctrl-H to switch back to 
Handles view, or Ctrl-L to toggle the lower 
pane on and off.
What does this information tell you? 
It gives you detailed insights into what 
makes up a process—how it’s composed 
of multiple threads, and what resources 
it utilizes in the form of handles and DLL 
ﬁles. Not only does it enable you to see 
exactly what’s happening with individual 
processes, but it also helps you to learn 
exactly how programs and processes run.
Get More Help
Process Explorer is a powerful tool, and it 
can take a while to get your head around 
it. The Help ﬁle is a good place to start—
press F1 to access it—but you’ll ﬁnd some 
handy online resources, too. There’s a PDF 
handout from Kansas State University 
(http://bit.ly/procexplhandout) that provides 
a good introduction—it was written back in 
2009, but is still relevant. And don’t forget 
the ofﬁcial Process Explorer forum (http://
forum.sysinternals.com), which contains 
an FAQ, among other handy resources.
It’s also worth taking a look at some of 
Sysinternals’ other tools as well—Autoruns 
(http://bit.ly/autoruns) gives you a similarly 
detailed view of the start-up process, split 
across major tabs. It’s easier to grasp than 
Process Explorer, and provides you with 
all the tools you need to streamline your 
startup. If you want to monitor ﬁle system, 
Registry, process, thread, and DLL activity 
in real time, then Process Monitor (http://
bit.ly/processmonitor) is the tool to go for—
this is particularly handy if a program is 
crashing, because it provides you with more 
detail as to where in the process things 
might be going wrong. Finally, RAMMap 
(http://bit.ly/ram-map) lets you take a peek 
into how your system RAM is managed. 
Struggling to identify a window’s parent 
process or thread? Open Process Explorer, 
then drag the target-like icon next to the 
binoculars icon on to the window in question, 
and its associated thread is highlighted.
Click the binoculars icon or press Ctrl-F 
to open the search tool—this enables you 
to search by handle or DLL substring to see 
which processes are using (and possibly 
holding on to) resources. If you can’t 
access a ﬁle because “it’s open in another 
program,” this can ﬁnd what’s locking it.
Choose “View > Select Columns,” and 
you’ll see you can view pretty much any kind 
of data about a process or thread that you 
want. Most useful views can be found on the 
“Process Image” (for additional info about 
the process) and “Process Performance” 
tabs (check “CPU History,” for example, to 
track a process’s resource consumption 
over time on a graph). Many of these options 
are overkill, but Google any terms to ﬁnd out 
more about them. Also take the time to look 
at the “Handles” and “DLL” tabs—you can 
add extra information to both panes.
We like running Task Manager and 
Process Explorer together, but if Process 
Explorer offers all the functionality you 
need, you can make it your default task 
manager—choose “Options > Replace 
Task Manager.” Now, pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del 
or right-clicking the Taskbar and choosing 
“Task Manager” launches Process Explorer.
Should you wish to reset Process 
Explorer to its defaults, right-click its 
system tray icon, and choose “Close Process 
Explorer.” Press Win-R, type “regedit,” and 
hit Enter. Navigate to “HKEY_CURRENT_
USER\SOFTWARE\Sysinternals.” Right-
click the “Process Explorer” subkey, choose 
“Delete,” then close Registry Editor.

HOOK IT UP
We’ll concentrate on streaming the Xbox One in this main part 
of the tutorial—look to the right if you’re streaming your PS4. 
But the primary step counts for both: Connect them to the ﬁnest 
network you can get your hands on. A wireless network barely cuts 
it—there’s a lot of data to stream fast, particularly if you don’t want 
your games to look like a 1999 RealPlayer video hidden behind a 
layer of petroleum jelly. This counts for both ends, so grab those 
Ethernet cables if possible, and pick up some high-end powerline 
networking kit if applicable.

XBOX ON
Switch on your console—hooked up to your TV for now—and 
make sure it’s completely up to date with the latest ﬁrmware. 
This usually means a massive download from Microsoft’s oh-so-
sluggish servers, but when it’s done, you’ll be ready to take the 
necessary steps to allow streaming. In the Xbox One’s left-hand 
vertical menu, hit the cog icon, select “All settings,” and head down 
to “Preferences.” You’ll ﬁnd all the options you need in the “Game 
DVR & streaming” menu. It’s quite possible your Xbox is already 
conﬁgured to share itself, the promiscuous thing, but if it isn’t, just 
tick “Allow game streaming to other devices” [Image A].

SORT SECURITY
Here’s a slightly annoying thing: If you want this to work 
reliably without having to commandeer the TV each time you 
want to get started, you’ll need to set your Xbox to automatically

And—sacrilegiously—why should you feel tied to the (awesome) cycle of constant upgrades your 
PC requires to keep up with the latest gaming standards? Maybe you’ve got a laptop, a supremely 
portable but doggedly non-upgradeable machine. What then? 
Well, fear not. If you’re happy with the quality of console gaming, and you’ve already kitted out 
your lounge with a modern console, you can stream your gaming to your PC, and play anywhere in 
the house (or, in the case of the PS4, anywhere with a fast enough Internet connection). There are 
even added beneﬁts beyond the ability to game on the throne. Those expensive 360 controllers your

don’t have the latest software on either end. Finally, you’ll need to 
launch the app and sign in to it with your Xbox Live credentials—the 
same credentials signed into your Xbox One. One more roadblock: 
If your Windows user account doesn’t match these details, you may 
encounter problems here. If you’re stuck, create a new user account 
using your Xbox Live login, and run the Xbox app from there.

CONNECT
The Xbox app looks a lot like the Xbox One dashboard—
confusingly so at times. Look on the left for a menu marked 
“Connect,” and ﬁnd your Xbox One in the list that appears. This 
synchronizes the two, giving you the option in the main menu of the 
Xbox app to either stream directly—which will put you in control of 
the Xbox One dash [Image C]—or just to select an installed game 
and stream that. Plug in an Xbox controller (or use your wireless 
controller, if you’re close enough to your console), and you’re away.
6 
TROUBLESHOOTING
Here’s where you’re going to have to face facts about your 
network. If it’s not up to scratch, you may see graphical 
glitches [Image D], hear audio squelches, or face the indignity of 
desynchronized gameplay, speeding up and slowing down as your 
PC struggles to catch up. If this happens to you, move your mouse 
to the top-right icon, and tweak the quality of streaming. You may 
ﬁnd the lower levels acceptable, particularly given your new levels 
of streaming convenience. 
7 
TAKE IT FURTHER
Note that you don’t have to stream within your house if 
you want to share your gameplay with the world—Twitch 
streaming is built into the Xbox One, and its options can be found 
in the “Preferences” section. Don’t expect to use both streaming 
options at once, though, unless you’re rocking some sort of extreme 
übernetwork. And if this has whetted your whistle, look into Steam’s 
Remote Play features, and take advantage of that gaming rig now 
you know that your network can handle it.

The PS4 has been a streaming beast for some 
time, piping its games to such unloved and 
unpurchased devices as the PlayStation TV and 
PlayStation Vita. As part of the April 3.5 ﬁrmware 
update, Sony seems to have admitted such 
failures, and opened its borders to streaming 
elsewhere, including, yes, the PC. Start by 
making sure your PS4 is running at least 3.5 
ﬁrmware—it should have come through as an 
automatic update, but if it hasn’t (if you have 
disabled automatic updates, for example), head 
to “Settings > System Software Update” to get 
it installed. 
Now prepare your PC. There’s not a huge 
system spec demand—2GB RAM, Core i5-560M 
—but, obviously, the better your machine is, the 
easier it’ll cope with the demands of streaming 
720p 60fps gameplay with minimal lag. Unlike 
the Xbox solution, Remote Play works online, so 
make sure you’ve also got a decent broadband 
connection—Sony recommends at least 12Mb/s. 
Next, head to https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.
net/remoteplay/lang/gb/index.html to grab the 
PC client and install it. 
Back on your PS4, make sure it’s your primary 
device (“Settings > PlayStation Network > 
Account Management > Activate as your primary 
PS4”), then ensure Remote Play is activated 
(“Settings > Remote Play connection settings”). 
Return to your PC, run the Remote Play app, and 
sign in with the same PSN credentials you’ve used 
on your PS4. Pick your resolution (start with the 
highest, as you can always notch it down later), 
hit “Start,” and you’ll see your PS4 menu. Now 
just use a USB cable to plug a PS4 controller into 
your streaming device, and you should be ready to 
play. Try it from a remote location away from your 
home network, too—you may have to dial down 
the settings somewhat, but it should work ﬁne.

Stream Your
Gaming With XSplit
1
DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL
We’ll begin with the obvious setup steps, and not go into huge 
detail because, hey, you can handle it, champ. Register a Twitch 
account at www.twitch.tv, register an XSplit account at www.xsplit.
com, then follow the links in your email to activate these accounts. 
Download XSplit Gamecaster and install it—if your machine 
is missing any of the prerequisites it needs, it grabs them and 
installs them for you, so make sure you’re online while you install. 
Run Gamecaster for the ﬁrst time, and you’re given the option to 
connect to your streaming service [Image A]. Twitch is selected by 
default, so click “Open Authentication Window,” log in, and click the 
“Authorize” button to share the relevant security keys from your 
account with XSplit. 
2
YOUR FIRST STREAM
Once Gamecaster has fully run, you’re already set to pull off 
a basic stream—simply open your chosen game, hit Ctrl-Tab 
to see the XSplit overlay, then hit “Stream” to begin sending your 
video to Twitch. XSplit automatically works out the optimal bitrate, 
based on your network connection. Switch away from your game, 
and XSplit displays a default BRB message to your viewers—this 
is a limitation of the free version, so if it bugs you, you should think 
about upgrading. 
3
HARDWARE TIMES
Quit your game for now (this stops the streaming 
automatically), and head back to the Gamecaster interface, 
so we can make sure it’s using the correct hardware to do its thing 
GAME STREAMING IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS. For some people, it’s actually possible (though 
improbable) to make a living sitting in front of your PC, thanks to the generosity of viewers, and 
Twitch’s numerous partnership schemes. We’re not here today to teach you those particular 
secrets, though. We’re working on the most important step: getting yourself out there in a 
presentable, watchable manner. 
It’s worth mentioning here that this tutorial doesn’t only work for Twitch, though that’s the 
service most people use—you can also use XSplit Gamecaster to send your various embarrassing 
misplays and goofups to Hitbox, YouTube Live, and a number of other services. We’ll show you how 
to add additional accounts. And we’re working with the basic version of XSplit here; picking up 
a license (from $2.50 per month) will add heaps of extra features, and enable 1080p streaming 
without a watermark, so it’s worth considering if you’re picking up streaming steam. –ALEX COX

we wouldn’t recommend using, say, a laptop mic, just for 
the sake of those watching—and check that your webcam 
is hooked up, too. You should see a preview in the top-left 
of the window if it is. You can also tweak the audio levels 
that go out to your stream here—although, because these 
settings are also available through the XSplit overlay, you 
may be better altering them there, based on the feedback 
of your viewers.

ADD YOUR CAMERA
What would game streaming be if your viewers 
couldn’t see the look on your face as you get 
destroyed for the 32nd time? It would be rubbish. 
Thankfully, Gamecaster makes adding a camera to your 
stream a trivial matter. Go back to your game (you don’t 
have to resume streaming just yet), hit Ctrl-Tab to bring 
up the overlay, and click on the camera icon to plop your 
webcam on top of your game. Now drag the edges to resize 
it, and drag the center to place it where you want it, trying 
not to cover up anything important. It can be tough to play 
games with the self-conscious feedback loop caused by 
staring at your own face, but you can choose to have the 
cam only appear to stream viewers, thankfully. Hover your 
mouse over the bar on the edge of the webcam [Image C] 
and ﬁnd the visibility icon, then switch off “In Game HUD” 
to have it only appear to stream viewers.

KEEP UP WITH CHAT
Let us ﬂip the principle we just used to hide the webcam 
while playing, in order to introduce a layer that only we can 
see. Twitch chat, 30-second delay or not, is a vital part of staying 
connected to your audience, and if you’re running full-screen, or 
don’t have the luxury of multiple monitors, Gamecaster’s chat 
overlay is vital. Open the overlay with Ctrl-Tab, hover over the 
Twitch icon, and click the second icon down to show the Twitch chat 
panel. Find the visibility icon, and this time set it to only display on 
the in-game HUD. It’s also worth dropping the opacity of the window 
somewhat (take it all the way to zero to only see the chat messages), 
and repositioning it so it’s not covering vital areas of gameplay 
[Image D]. If you want to send messages while you’re playing, just 
open up the overlay as usual, and type into the gray box at the 
bottom of the chat window. Finishing your message with Shift-
Enter closes the overlay automatically when you’ve ﬁnished typing.
6
STREAMING PROPER
By now, you’ll have your layout locked down. Just a couple of 
things to do: set the title of your stream, and tell people you’re 
online. Hover over the Twitch icon, and hit the cog to customize your 
title—XSplit will have automatically matched up the game you’re 
playing with a game in Twitch’s extensive database. The next icon 
along enables you to share to Facebook and Twitter—click each 
icon to authorize your account, as you did with your Twitch account 
earlier on, then hit “Share” to send the message out.
7
MOVING HOME
Provided your YouTube account is in good standing, you can 
stream your gameplay via YouTube Live instead of Twitch. 
Head back to the Gamecaster app, go to the “Accounts” tab, and 
click the drop-down arrow to the right of your Twitch account. Select 
D
“YouTube Live,” and authorize the account as before. You 
may need to accept YouTube Live’s terms of service before 
you can complete this step; Gamecaster gives you a link 
if that’s the case. When you begin streaming, enter your 
stream info into the box provided—you can’t change this 
on the ﬂy as with Twitch—and be sure to change the status 
from “Unlisted” to “Public” if you want your channel’s 
subscribers to see that you’re streaming.
8
SEE YOUR STATUS
While streaming, keep half an eye on the “Start” tab 
of the Gamecaster window. It keeps you informed of 
your current bitrate, any dropped frames, and the load on 
your system from your game, XSplit, and overall [Image E]. 
If these numbers creep too high, you may need to drop 
your bitrate manually by going to “Settings,” clicking the 
“Automatic” box next to “Streaming,” selecting “Custom,” 
and dialing in your own options. Happy streaming! 
E
C
While XSplit hides many of its features behind its subscription 
fees, Open Broadcaster Software (www.obsproject.com) is a 
free, open source way to get your footage streaming online. 
It’s less user-friendly than Gamecaster, and there’s a reason 
the majority of streamers favor XSplit, but OBS might be a 
good move before stumping up the cash. It structures itself 
into scenes and sources, which you need to create before 
you can start streaming. A single scene can contain multiple 
sources—images, games, webcams—and setting up multiple 
scenes before streaming means you can transition smoothly 
between them. Grab OBS Studio for the most up-to-date 
version; it’s still in development, but it works just ﬁne.

Create Pro Streams
with Gameshow
1
STARTER’S ORDERS
Let’s start from the very beginning. Download Gameshow, 
install it, and run it. Skip past the release notes window, and 
you’re given your most basic creation options. You could, if you’re 
playing a popular game, opt for a template related to the likes of 
CS:GO or Dota 2, or choose one of Gameshow’s pre-built generic 
templates, but don’t. Although we’re in this for an easier time, that’s 
not going to teach you anything, and it certainly won’t make your 
stream unique. Instead, select “Blank,” then click “Next.” Now click 
the radio button for the service you’ll be streaming to, type in the 
title of the game you’ll be streaming, and, if you have a discrete 
graphics card, change up the encoder from the basic x264 software 
encoder to something with a bit more muscle. 
>> Users of the free version are stuck with a large animated 
watermark overlaid over any stream of 30fps 720p at 1,750Kbps or 
more, so drop the encoder settings down [Image A], unless that’s 
something you really want, or you are a paid-up user. Streamers to 
anything other than YouTube should also pick the most local server 
here. Hit “Next,” and you’re asked to authorize with your streaming 
service of choice, which only happens on your initial setup; you 
won’t be asked again if you create a new template in future. Just 
like that, you’re in—and doesn’t Gameshow’s dark exterior look 
intimidating? It does. But it’s a puppy inside. 
THE STREAMING MARKET on YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, et al is growing quickly. So quickly, in fact, 
that if you’re not putting out a professional-looking stream, you may struggle to gain any viewers 
at all. This is easier said than done. Open Broadcaster Software certainly gives you the ﬂexibility 
to produce a fully custom stream, but it’s among the most ugly and ﬁnicky pieces of software ever 
created. XSplit provides a beautiful overlay and a similarly beautiful interface, but a subscription 
involves a not-insigniﬁcant outlay. The solution? Streaming’s new kid on the block, Gameshow. It’s 
only been around for just over a year, but the fact that it was spawned from the labs of streaming 
expert TeleStream makes it the perfect tool to add a professional shine to your streams. It’s not 
free, unlike OBS, but there’s a limited-resolution or watermarked trial to use to see if you like it, and 
the full version involves just a $29, one-time outlay for 12 months of updates. –ALEX COX

GET THE SHOT
Let’s give you a quick primer. Gameshow uses three 
base components to create a streaming template: 
shots, layers, and, er, shot layers. Shots hold your 
delicately composed picture elements—your webcam, 
game, explanation text, and the like. Because they can 
be reordered in any manner you choose, these elements 
are called shot layers. Plain ol’ layers, on the other hand, 
enable you to slather several fully composed shots on top 
of one another. If you create, say, a stream overlay shot 
in the top layer, with your branding smeared all over it, 
and put a nice background shot in the bottom layer, you 
can easily ﬂick through several shots on the middle layer 
without affecting these in the slightest.
>> We’ll start by creating the most basic of shots. So, 
ﬁre up a game—absolutely any game will work for this—
and make sure that it’s running, ideally in a window or on 
a second monitor, so you can still see Gameshow. You’ll 
see, in the bottom portion of Gameshow’s main interface, 
that you have one blank shot at the moment, in the middle 
layer. This should be highlighted, and it’s the one you’re 
about to make changes to. In the left-hand column, 
click the plus button, then click “Screen capture” to tell 
Gameshow you want to capture something. This is a slight 
B

MAXIMUMPC
R&D
HOW TO 2017

misnomer, because this option enables you to capture a full screen, 
a window, or—as you’re now able to do by changing the capture type 
appropriately—a game. Click “Select Window/Monitor,” deselect 
“Capture any full screen game,” then select your game’s process in 
the upper drop-down box. Hit “OK,” and the game’s content, minus 
any ugly window borders, should appear in the preview window 
[Image B]. Hit “OK” once more, and your game now appears front-
and-center in your shot.
3 
FACE TIME
What streamer worth their salt would omit a good old 
facecam from proceedings? Presuming you’ve got a webcam 
hooked up and pointing at your visage, this is a trivial matter: Just 
add a new element to your shot as before, but this time select 
“Capture devices,” and then your webcam. Here’s where things 
get a bit more tricky, though. For one, that camera is now going 
to be obscuring some of the game. And if you’re anything like us, 
it’s also going to be capturing the strewn detritus of a particularly 
disorganized ofﬁce. Time to make use of Gameshow’s Properties 
panel to set things right. First, click your game capture layer in the 
left column, then click the slider icon above. Dragging the scale 
C
sliders [Image C] enables you to resize the game to your 
liking, and you can click and drag it in the central shot 
composition window to place it exactly where you want it. 
>> Now head back to the shot layers section, and select 
your webcam. Back in the Properties panel, scroll to the 
bottom, and expand the Crop menu. You can use these 
sliders to trim away the abandoned chip bags and dirty 
plates, and then resize and reposition your webcam as you 
did before.
4 
ALL THE ELEMENTS
If you were to start your stream now (by clicking 
the broadcast icon, at the top-left of the shot 
composition window), your viewers wouldn’t get a very 
good show. In fact, they would see what’s currently in the 
live view on the right-hand side—a boring gray screen. 
This is down to the way Gameshow handles its output; 
you can compose shots and make tweaks on the ﬂy, but a 
shot, or any changes you’ve made to it, aren’t (by default) 
broadcast until you explicitly make it so by selecting it and 
hitting the Space bar. This is super-handy for maintaining 
Great sound is absolutely critical for 
online 
streaming—some 
say 
even 
more so than a great picture. While 
Gameshow’s primary focus is on making 
awesome-looking streams, it’s adept 
at improving your audio, too. Your 
individual shot layers can be muted or 
unmuted by clicking the speaker icon 
next to them, or you can click a shot layer, 
then hit the speaker icon above, to alter 
individual volumes and pans. Clicking 
the headphone icon below any of the 
vertical meters enables you to monitor 
what sounds are coming out (useful for 
checking your mic before you stream), 
and you have access to quick volume 
controls if anything starts to hit the red.
The meat of Gameshow’s audio 
tweaks, though, are found in the Audio 
Mixer, which you can bring up by hitting 
Ctrl-U. Activate a shot with, say, your 
microphone in it, and that element 
appears here. You can then add various 
equalizing and boosting effects, or alter 
the balance of your audio to ensure you 
can be heard over your blaring game.

a professional appearance, but something you’ll have to remember 
to do as you stream.
>> Even if your shot had gone live, your viewers still wouldn’t be 
getting a very good show, as you’re broadcasting with no audio. You 
can add different audio sources to different shots, but this is a good 
opportunity to make use of a layer to ensure your system audio is 
audible, no matter what shot is live. In the uppermost layer, click 
the plus button to create a new shot, and select “Capture Devices 
> System Audio Capture.” Bear in mind this grabs any sound 
your machine makes, not just that of the game, which is perfect 
if you want to involve chums on Discord or Skype, but less neat if 
Windows 10 is going to shout at you with repeated noisy pop-ups, 
so make sure your Windows notiﬁcations are all switched off. You 
also have no microphone audio at this point. We’ll leave adding this 
particular shot layer as a little exercise for you—if you’re going to 
create, for example, a BRB shot, you may wish to add it to individual 
shots on the central layer, rather than having it active at all times. 
5 
SHOT FOR SHOT
Gameshow is adept at transitioning between 
different shots, so let’s try that now. Right-click 
your shot in the lower portion of the interface, and select 
“Duplicate shot.” Change the copy by using the shot layer 
properties controls to make your webcam bigger and your 
game smaller, then hit the red dot button at the top-right 
of the Gameshow window to see only the live view. Switch 
to your new shot by highlighting it and hitting Space, and 
you’ll see the components smoothly resize themselves; 
switch back using the same process, and you’ll see the 
opposite happen. 
>> You can create more complex transitions between 
shots using the Switch menu on the main menu bar. Select 
your choice of an immediate cut, a smooth transition (which 
is what we’ve been using so far), or one of a number of 
fancy dissolves and wipes [Image D]. Note the “Go” option 
at the top of the menu—using Space still pulls off the old 
smooth transition; if you want to use your new one, either 
select “Go,” or hit Ctrl-G. Alternatively, and this basically 
does away with the “compose your shot before it goes live” 
deal, you can switch on AutoLive in the Switch menu, which 
changes shots, using your fancy transition, as soon as you 
click on them. If you’re going to use this, make sure you’ve 
planned out your stream, and composed all the shots you 
need, before going live.
6 
STREAM AWAY
Now would be a good time to test your stream, and 
the only way you can really do this is by going live. 
There’s a broadcast icon at the top-left of the preview 
window; click this, and you start sending your stream to the 
Internet. Keep an eye on the stats that now pop up. They let 
you know the bitrate you’re broadcasting at, the amount of 
CPU power your stream is draining, the number of viewers 
your stream currently has, and, importantly, the number 
of frames you’ve dropped. If you start dropping a lot of 
You can add just about anything to your 
Gameshow streams. We’ve discussed 
media ﬁles, a category that covers 
images, videos, and audio. Then there 
are 
screen 
captures, 
encapsulating 
windows, monitors, and games. You can 
also add text boxes, either static or drawn 
from an RSS feed, and make them scroll if 
you wish. You can pull in your Twitch chat, 
giving your viewers a chance to see their 
carefully chosen words (or hastily typed 
Kappas) on the stream itself. There’s a 
social media widget, which is a quick way 
to publicize your social feeds, as well as 
a live Twitter layer, which compiles your 
latest tweets. You can even run donation 
drives, as long as you’re signed up with 
imraising.tv and have an API key.
If your desired layer isn’t in the long 
list of included options, it could be time 
for a little improvisation on your part. 
Twitch users, for instance, should head 
over to www.streampro.io and link 
their Twitch account to the StreamPro 
service. You can then create your very 
own custom overlay, and include a whole 
host of live information. Copy its overlay 
URL, then go back to Gameshow, and add 
a new “web display” shot layer, pasting 
the URL into the appropriate box to see 
your chosen design pasted on top of your 
regular stream.

frames, look for potential issues with your Internet connection, or 
drop your bitrate (“Output > Output Settings”) to the point where 
your broadband connection can handle it properly.
>> While you’re streaming, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your 
Twitch (or YouTube, or Hitbox) dashboard [Image E], reachable via 
the Output menu, to ensure you’ve titled your video correctly, and to 
keep an eye on chat. Professionalism in presentation is one thing, 
but you need a keen eye on your audience if you want to keep them 
coming back. As we’re only testing, though, it may be a good idea to 
cast an eye over your stream to make sure everything’s coming out 
as you expect. Listen to the audio—if there are problems, follow the 
steps in the “Sound Advice” box, pg. 61, to ﬁx them. Watch the video, 
and check your transitions—this is where you’ll understand exactly 
what you’re doing wrong.
7 
ADDING FLOURISHES
With a test stream out of the way, now’s the time to start 
delving further into Gameshow’s features to see what else 
you can do. Visual shot layers—game capture, webcams, any videos 
you might have added in—can be manipulated beyond scaling and 
cropping. Try tweaking the X and Y rotation to put these elements 
on a wacky angle, for instance. This isn’t recommended for the 
main focus of your footage, but might be a nice effect for your 
webcam. You can also add mattes, trimming or blurring the edges 
of your shot layers, and while the built-in options aren’t particularly 
good—unless you want your game surrounded by a cartoon heart 
[Image F] or a silly spiky edge—you can import your own images as 
custom mattes.
>> The more pallid among us may wish to tweak the color options, 
too. Boosting the saturation and contrast can make a big difference 
to the output of poor webcams, and there’s a handy reset button if 
you happen to leave yourself looking like a diseased alien. If you’re 
lucky enough to be sitting in front of a brightly colored background, 
you can also use Gameshow’s built-in chroma key options to mask 
it out altogether. Click the head-and-shoulders icon to bring them 
up, switch chroma key on with the appropriate checkbox, check 
the box that lets you pick the key color, and click in your preview 
to isolate your background. There may be a fair amount of 
slider tweaking required before you get brilliant results, 
and bear in mind that this is chroma key, rather than color 
key, which means it can only remove bright colors, not 
whites or blacks.
8 
FINISHING TOUCHES
You’re pretty much familiar with the basics of 
Gameshow now, so let’s go about tidying up 
your stream layout with a ﬁnal spit and polish. Add in a 
background on the bottommost layer (to go behind your 
game and webcam) by creating a 16:9 image in your favorite 
arty program, and adding a new “media ﬁle” shot layer. 
Now create yourself a BRB shot in the uppermost layer, 
for when you’re away from your PC, or getting your stream 
set up. Create a new shot (ideally, this time, without your 
system audio or microphone input attached), add an image 
by adding a media ﬁle as before, and—hey, why not?—add 
some royalty-free music, too. It’s added in the same way 
as you would add an image, and is set to automatically loop 
while the shot is active. Happy streaming!

GETTING STARTED
The following tutorial works with your basic Ubuntu 16.04 
install, and should happily run on 16.10 or 17.04—the only real 
requirement is that your PC is on and connected to the Internet at 
home whenever you want to employ your VPN’s services abroad.
>> First, let’s install OpenVPN Server. Although it’s part of the 
ofﬁcial Ubuntu repositories, you can’t install it through Software 
Center, so open a Terminal window, and type the following:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsa
JUST HOW SECURE IS YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION? The answer is often “not very.” One of the 
most dangerous places to surf the web or check your email is via a public Wi-Fi hotspot. What you 
need is a guaranteed form of encryption to keep your business private, and that’s where a virtual 
private network (VPN) comes in.
VPNs are designed to add an extra layer of security to the Internet and other public networks. 
They basically create a secure “tunnel,” inside which all your data is encrypted before being sent 
over the network. Their main use for home users is to provide a secure connection to the Internet, 
even over insecure networks. Commercial VPN services offer free packages, but these are slow 
and limited.
A much better option is to add your own VPN to your Ubuntu computer for free. Thanks to 
OpenVPN, you can set up your own server, then conﬁgure it to provide one or more devices (mobile 
or computer) with a secure on-demand VPN whenever it’s required. Without further ado, then, let’s 
get started. –NICK PEERS

use OpenVPN in a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), which 
consists of public and private keys for each server and 
client, with the public keys being used to identify trusted 
clients and servers to each other. These public keys are 
signed using certiﬁcates to verify their identity, and your 
server needs to be conﬁgured as a Certiﬁcate Authority 
(CA) to create, distribute, and manage these certiﬁcates. 
>> First job, then, is to set up your CA, and build the 
server’s private and public keys—check out the step-
by-step guide opposite for details. Once that process is 
complete, it’s a good idea to “harden” your VPN’s security 
further with the following Terminal commands:
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca
 $ ./build-dh
 $ openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key
2
CONFIGURE OPENVPN SERVER
Now it’s time for the nitty-gritty: conﬁguring your 
OpenVPN Server, and getting it up and running. 
First, you need to copy the encryption keys and other ﬁles 
you’ve just created to the “/etc/openvpn” directory, again 
using the Terminal:
A
Open up a Terminal, and then type the 
following command in order to create an 
empty ﬁle:
 $ nano ~/openvpn-ca/client-conﬁgs/
 make_conﬁg.sh
Now you need to carefully enter the 
following lines:
 #!/bin/bash
 # First argument: Client identiﬁer
 KEY_DIR=~/openvpn-ca/keys
OUTPUT_DIR=~/openvpn-ca/client-
 conﬁgs/ﬁles
 BASE_CONFIG=~/openvpn-ca/client-
 conﬁgs/client.conf
 cat ${BASE_CONFIG} \
    <(echo -e ‘<ca>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/ca.crt \
    <(echo -e ‘</ca>\n<cert>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/${1}.crt \
    <(echo -e ‘</cert>\n<key>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/${1}.key \
    <(echo -e ‘</key>\n<tls-auth>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/ta.key \
    <(echo -e ‘</tls-auth>’) \
    > ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${1}.ovpn
Once created, save and close the ﬁle, 
before typing the following command to 
make it executable:
 $ chmod 700 ~/openvpn-ca/client-
 conﬁgs/make_conﬁg.sh

 pem /etc/openvpn
>> Replace  MyVPN.crt  and  MyVPN.key  with the value you 
allocated to  KEY_NAME  in the walkthrough above. Next, you need 
to generate your OpenVPN conﬁguration ﬁle:
 $ cd /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-conﬁg-ﬁles
 $ sudo cp server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn
 $ sudo gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz
>> Now follow the second step-by-step guide (over the page) 
to conﬁgure your server for basic usage. Once done, you need to 
perform one critical step to allow your clients to actually access 
the Internet through your VPN. First, enter the following command:
 $ ip route | grep default
>> Make a note of the interface listed next to “dev”—on 
our machine, this is “enp0s3.” Now enter the following 
command, substituting  enp0s3  with the interface listed 
on your PC, if applicable:
 $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o 
 enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE

START AND TEST YOUR SERVER
It’s time to get things up and running. Type the 
following Terminal command, which launches 
OpenVPN using the server.conf ﬁle you’ve conﬁgured:
 $ sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
1. SET UP CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY DIRECTORY
First, you need to copy the easy-rsa template directory to your 
home directory, so your custom certiﬁcates aren’t overwritten 
when the package is updated. So, open the Terminal and type 
the following:
 $ make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca
 $ nano vars
2. EDIT VARS FILE
Scroll down to the group of lines beginning “export KEY_
COUNTRY,” and ﬁll them in with your own personal information—
see the screenshot for an example. Note “KEY_PROVINCE” 
should be ﬁlled with the state, such as “Mississippi” or 
“California.” Put your name or organization in “KEY_ORG,” and 
ﬁll “KEY_OU” and “KEY_NAME” with whatever you like, such as 
“MyVPN.” Save the ﬁle (Ctrl-O) and exit.
3. BUILD CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY
At the Terminal, verify you’re still in the openvpn-ca directory, 
then type: “source vars” and hit Enter. You should see a “NOTE” 
appear (see screenshot). Now type “./clean-all” and hit Enter, 
followed by “./build-ca” and hit Enter. You’re taken through the 
root certiﬁcate authority key and certiﬁcate. Hit Enter when 
prompted to conﬁrm each edit you made in the previous step.
4. GENERATE SERVER’S KEYS
Type “./build-key-server MyVPN” and hit Enter, replacing 
“MyVPN” with the value you entered for “KEY_NAME” in step 2. 
Hit Enter to accept the default choices as before. When prompted 
to create a challenge password, hit Enter to leave it blank, and 
hit Enter again when prompted for an optional company name. 
Complete the process by pressing Y to the last two prompts.

 $ sudo systemctl status openvpn@server
>> You should see a list of messages appear on screeen, including 
the all-important “active (running)” message [Image A], along with 
“Initialization sequence completed” at the bottom—press Ctrl-C to 
interrupt the status check. Next, check that the OpenVPN interface

MAKE CLIENT CONFIGURATION EASY
The simplest way to conﬁgure your client is through 
the use of specially made .ovpn ﬁles, inside which 
the required key ﬁles are embedded, along with the 
settings needed to connect. These are created on your 
server, and here’s what you need to do.
>> Create a directory structure inside which your client 
conﬁguration ﬁles are stored, then lock down the directory 
permissions, and create a base conﬁg ﬁle to work from:
 $ mkdir -p ~/openvpn-ca/client-conﬁgs/ﬁles
 $ chmod 700 ~/openvpn-ca/client-conﬁgs/ﬁles
>> Now open the Nautilus ﬁle manager, click the 
“Computer” link on the left, and browse to /usr/share/
1. DEFINE SERVER KEYS
Open the conﬁguration ﬁle you’ve just created using  sudo nano /  
 etc/openvpn/server.conf  at the Terminal. We’re going to focus 
on the bare minimum settings required to get your server up 
and running. Start by scrolling down to the “# SSL/TLS root 
certiﬁcate…” section, and changing the “cert server.crt” and 
“key server.key” lines to point to the ﬁles you created in step 
four of the previous walkthrough.
2. IMPLEMENT EXTRA ENCRYPTION
Now press Ctrl-W, and type “tls-auth”—you’re taken to a line 
marked “;tls-auth ta.key 0.” Remove the semi-colon from the 
beginning of this line (a process known as uncommenting) to 
enable it. Now add the following line underneath it, as shown 
in the screenshot above: “key-direction 0”—this ensures that 
the extra TLS authentication that you set up earlier is enabled 
for OpenVPN.
3. CONFIGURE WEB DIRECTION
These next tweaks instruct all connected clients to route their 
web trafﬁc through the VPN. Press Ctrl-W to locate “redirect-
gateway,” and uncomment the line it’s on: “push….” Uncomment 
the next two instances of “push” referring to DNS servers, as 
shown above. Finally, search for “nobody,” and uncomment the 
“user nobody” and “group nogroup” lines. Save and exit.
4. ENABLE IP FORWARDING
Type  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf  and uncomment out the 
following line by removing the preceding # symbol from it: 
“#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1.” Save and exit, then type the following 
command to reload sysctl:  sudo sysctl -p . You should see  
“net.ipv4 ip_forward =1” appear, indicating the setting has been 
correctly applied. That’s it!

You can access your OpenVPN server 
through a variety of platforms—there’s an 
ofﬁcial client for Windows, Android, and 
iOS (visit www.openvpn.net for details), 
while MacOS users can use Tunnelblick 
(www.tunnelblick.net). Transferring the 
.opvn conﬁguration ﬁle varies from 
device to device: you can simply copy the 
ﬁle to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\conﬁg 
in Windows, for example, or double-click 
it to import it into Tunnelblick on MacOS.
If you’re running an Ubuntu client, you 
can install some additional packages and 
manage your connection through the 
GUI-friendly Network Manager. Open 
Terminal and type the following:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install network- 
 manager-openvpn-gnome
Once installed, open the Network 
Manager from the menu bar, select “Edit 
Connections,” then click “Add.” Choose 
“Import a saved VPN conﬁguration…” 
from the drop-down menu, and click 
“Create.” Select your .ovpn ﬁle, and 
click “Open,” then verify the settings 
are correct across the four tabs (click 
“Advanced > TLS Authentication tab” to 
conﬁrm it’s also recognized the TLS key). 
Give your connection a more suitable 
name—the name you assigned your VPN 
under KEY_NAME, say—and click “Save.”
Once done, connect through the 
Network Manager’s VPN submenu—you 
should see a lock appear over the menu 
bar’s icon, indicating the connection has 
successfully been made. The ﬁnal step 
is to open your browser to verify the 
connection works.
SET UP YOUR CLIENT
doc/openvpn/examples/sample-conﬁg-ﬁles/. Copy the client.conf 
ﬁle from here to ~/openvpn-ca/client-conﬁgs. Double-click the 
copied ﬁle to edit it in gedit [Image B]. First, locate the line marked  
 remote my-server-1 1194 , and change this to point toward your 
server’s public IP address or dynamic DNS name—for example,  
 remote 1.2.3.4 1194  or  remote dynamic.ddns.net 1194 .
>> Next, uncomment both  ;user nobody  and  ;group nogroup , 
before commenting out the lines  ca ca.crt ,  cert client.crt , and  
 key client.key , because they’re added by the batch ﬁle. Last, but 
not least, add the following line beneath  ;tls-auth ta.key 1  (which 
should remain commented out):  key-direction 1 . Save and 
exit, then follow the instructions in the box on page 64 to create 
the make_conﬁg.sh ﬁle, which you’ll use to generate the client 
conﬁguration ﬁles whenever they’re needed for each client.
5 
GENERATE A CLIENT CONFIGURATION FILE
You’ve now got all the tools you need to create your client 
conﬁguration ﬁles. Here’s the process you need to follow in 
order to build them. First, you need to generate a certiﬁcate and key 
for your client using the following two commands:
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca && source vars
>> This time, ignore the note—we don’t want to clean anything—
and then type:
 $ ./build-key client1
>> You need a unique name for each client certiﬁcate you 
generate—so, for subsequent certiﬁcates, you would use  client2 , 
 client3 , and so on. Again, you’re taken through a similar 
process as when you ran the build-server-key command, 
and the answers are exactly the same—no challenge 
password, and accepting the default choices.
>> Once generated, build the conﬁguration ﬁle:
 $ cd client-conﬁgs
 $ ./make_conﬁg.sh client1
>> You’ll ﬁnd a ﬁle marked client1.ovpn inside the client-
conﬁgs/ﬁles subfolder. This now needs to be securely 
transferred to your client—the box above reveals the 
different options available to you, and how to conﬁgure 
a VPN connection to your server from another Ubuntu 
PC. Congratulations—you’ve just made your Internet 
connection more secure [Image C].

USB stick in the menu on the left. Select “Rename,” and call it 
“Emergency.” If you’ve used the memory stick before, you can 
wipe it by right-clicking it, and selecting “Format > Restore device

PREPARE FOR ACCIDENTS
Now we need to start building our toolkit. A common disaster 
is accidentally deleting a ﬁle—whether it’s from your hard 
VIRUSES, MALWARE, ACCIDENTAL DELETION, or corrupted data can all put your valuable ﬁles at

When you install a program, not only are the ﬁles it needs to run saved on your hard drive, but 
it also makes its own changes to the rest of your system, such as adding entries to the Registry. 
Portable apps don’t do this, so you can save them to a USB stick, and use them on any PC by double-

Manage Passwords 
With KeePassX
Wherever you go these days, you need passwords. The number of websites that expect you to 
provide a username and password to access all their content is even greater than the number 
of sites providing helpful advice on good and bad practice for passwords. So what are we to do? 
You should already be using a secure operating system, but any system is only as secure as its 
users. Passwords are less effective once they are written on pieces of paper stuck to the sides of 
monitors, or saved in text ﬁles. The three questions we will try to answer here are: How should I 
choose my passwords, how can I check that my passwords really are secure enough, and how do I 
keep track of them without resorting to pieces of paper? –NEIL BOTHWICK
YOU’LL NEED THIS
KEEPASSX 
Store your passwords 
securely on your machine 
with this free tool from
www.keepassx.org.
1
KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
Ask people which they think is their most important password, 
and many will say that it is their login password (unless they 
use a password manager, in which case it may be that one). It 
isn’t, though—your login password only gives access to your user 
account on your computer. The most dangerous password to have 
compromised is the one to your email account. Why? Think of all the 
websites you have to log into—how many of them have a “Click here 
if you forgot your password” link? These links generally send an 
email with a password reset URL to the email address you registered 
with them. If someone gets hold of your email credentials, they can 
use those details to discover your password for many websites, 
including ecommerce sites that may already hold payment details. 
It also means they can delete any responses and notiﬁcations about 
password resets, not to mention acknowledgement emails for any 
orders they may place using your account—so keep your email 
password safe, secure, and unique.
2
DANGEROUS REMINDERS
Even if your password is safe, email is not a secure medium; 
all data travels as plain text, so it’s not a good idea to make 
a habit of email password reminders and resets. However, most 
people have more online identities and login names than they 
can remember passwords for, so how do you remember your 
passwords without breaking any of the golden rules about reusing 
the same password or using simple ones?
A
No, we’re not talking about drunken mates discovering your 
Facebook password and making embarrassing status updates on 
your behalf. None of us will be here forever, so we should make 
sure there is a way for our families to access our online information 
and know about online billing when our time is up. When someone 
died recently, we were asked for help to extract a lot of important 
password-protected information from his smartphone, because 
no one else knew the password—as if his wife didn’t have enough 
to worry about at the time. A copy of your password database on a 
USB stick, along with a note of the password (or details of your online 
password storage) in a safe place will make it possible for others to 
sort out your affairs after you’re gone.
IF THE WORST 
HAPPENS
3
PASSWORD STORAGE
One solution is a password manager. Most web 
browsers have an option to save passwords, but 
these are neither universal nor portable. You could use a 
system such as LastPass (http://lastpass.com) [Image A], 
which stores your passwords and has extensions for most 
browsers to automatically complete forms. This means 
you only need to remember the master password, which 
you can then make more secure. However, such services 
may restrict you to web usage, and require you to entrust 
all of your passwords to a third party. Yes, they store the 
passwords encrypted, but they do so using their own 
encryption, not yours, so they are potentially susceptible 
to security breaches.
4
BUILD YOUR OWN
Another option is to keep your own password 
database, using a program such as KeePassX 
[Image B], which has versions that run on Windows, Mac 
OS, Linux, Android, and iOS. These all use the same 
storage format, enabling you to share your password 
database across any devices you own or have access to, 
especially if you keep the database itself in some sort of 
cloud storage, such as Dropbox, or even your own server, 
using ownCloud or similar.

5 
CHOOSING PASSWORDS
A password that is easy to crack is no use, but neither is one 
so convoluted that you don’t stand a chance of remembering 
it yourself. If you use a password manager, many of them have an 
option to generate long, random, cryptic passwords, but you still 
need a password for the manager, and that has to be really secure. 
Any password not stored in a database has to be easy to remember 
but hard to guess.
6 
COMPLICATED SIMPLICITY
There’s a number of factors that affect the guessability of 
a password. Using so-called dictionary words—which also 
include proper nouns, place names, and common names—is a sure 
way to make your password easy to guess. Other important factors 
to consider are the number of characters used, and the number 
of possible choices for each character. Increasing either of these 
makes the password more secure, which is why it is commonly 
recommended to use mixed case, numbers, and even symbols. 
7 
STRONG PASSWORDS
However, these can make passwords far harder to remember, 
not to mention making them extremely tedious to type on a 
touchscreen keyboard. So how do you create a password that is 
long enough to be secure, isn’t a dictionary word, and can be typed 
on a mobile device? One answer is the same way you create a less 
secure password, several times over. Ask someone to remember 
a 24-character password, and they will probably not even consider 
it, but ask them to remember four six-letter passwords, 
and there will be no such reaction. All you then have 
to remember is the order of the four words run into one 
[Image C]. You can ring further changes, using numbers 
in place of some letters, à la leet speak, and using mixed 
case or deliberate misspellings. By doing so, you end up 
with a more secure password, as long as the four words 
you choose are unrelated in everyone’s mind but your own. 
Most importantly, though, you can remember it, you do not 
need to write it down, or worry about forgetting it.
8 
BETTER SECURITY FOR ALL
KeePassX uses an encrypted database to store 
URLs, login names, and passwords for your 
favorite sites. There are versions available for all desktop 
and mobile operating systems, so you can keep a single 
database everywhere. There is even a portable version of 
the Windows program that you can keep on a USB stick 
along with its database ﬁle.
KeePassX does more than simply store passwords; it 
can also type them into the browser for you. The default 
setting is to send the username, a tab, the password, and 
Enter, but you can change this for each site. Version 2 of 
KeePassX can be conﬁgured to send more than two items. 
Some sites, particularly banking sites, now require three 
pieces of information. Cryptic passwords can be generated 
automatically for each site, or you can pick your own and it 
will let you know how strong it is. The database is a single 
ﬁle, and an important one, so keep a copy in a safe place. 
B
C
How do you know whether or not 
you have a strong password? 
There’s a number of websites that 
check password strength, and 
even give an indication of how long 
they would take to crack, such as 
https://howsecureismypassword.
net. You don’t want to give your 
real passwords to such sites, but 
you can use them to check the 
style of password you are using. 
Another option is to use a 
downloadable tool, such as Hash 
Suite (http://hashsuite.openwall.
net), to try to work out your 
passwords. This is a Windows 
utility developed by one of the 
contributors to the respected 
John the Ripper tool, which is only 
available for Linux and Mac OSes 
(www.openwall.com/john). These 
tools are primarily designed for 
system admins, but are also useful 
for anyone who is concerned about 
the strength of their passwords 
and system security.

Power Up Your 
Plex Media Server
1
USE THE RIGHT FORMAT
The most effective way to improve performance is by reducing—
or even eliminating—transcoding. Transcoding converts your 
media stream from its native format to one that’s compatible 
with your media-playing device, so the more exotic and varied 
your media formats are, the more likely it is that Plex needs to 
transcode them.
>> Wherever possible, save your media in .mp4 ﬁle containers 
using the H.264 video and AAC or MP3 audio codecs—this is the 
closest to a universal format you can get, and most devices should 
be able to play it directly. Handbrake (www.handbrake.fr) can do 
this for you.
>> The critical elements here are the codecs—if you use a 
different ﬁle container (such as .mkv or .avi) with H.264 and AAC/
MP3, Plex uses a process called Direct Stream to “remux” the 
ﬁle in a compatible container (typically .mp4) before streaming it. 
Although this requires extra processing power, remuxing is far less 
demanding than a full transcode.
2
ADD SUBTITLES
If you need subtitles, it’s important to choose the right 
format if you use external ﬁles—otherwise Plex has 
to transcode the stream to accommodate them. Go to “Media 
Preparation > Subtitles” at https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us 
for instructions. Here you’ll discover which formats to choose 
IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A MEDIA SERVER that doesn’t just enable you to organize and play your 
media, but shows it off in the best possible way, you need Plex. It works across just about any device 
you own, and enables you to watch across multiple platforms, both at home and over the Internet, 
picking up where you left off watching on another device.
The biggest issue with Plex is choosing the server to run it on. A PC is an obvious choice, but it 
needs to be left on 24/7 for unlimited access. You’re better off installing it on a dedicated low-power 
device, such as a high-end NAS, like QNAP’s TS-251+, which boasts a quad-core Celeron CPU and 
hardware transcoding engine. But that’s not necessarily affordable, so a cheaper NAS with app 
support (like the WD My Cloud [Image A]) or a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 is capable of serving media.
The major trade-off is performance—you free up resources from your main PC, but your server 
is slower and visibly less responsive. It still does the job, though, and armed with the following tips, 
you’ll squeeze that bit more performance from it to deliver a great media experience. –NICK PEERS

Languages,” check the “Automatically select” box, and set 
“Subtitle mode” to “Shown with foreign audio,” and “Prefer 
subtitles in” to “English.” 
>> Subtitles are notorious for being out of sync—if your 
media player doesn’t provide offset controls (typically in 
milliseconds), visit www.subsedit.com/simple to paste 
in your subtitles from a text editor, select an offset, and 
generate a new .srt ﬁle that syncs perfectly. Use VLC 
Media Player’s “Tools > Track Synchronization” with the 
original .srt ﬁle to calculate the offset you need.

SPEED UP NETWORK CONNECTIONS
If you connect your server wirelessly to your 
network, you can improve its performance by taking 
it off your congested Wi-Fi network, and connecting it via 
Ethernet cable—either directly to your router, or indirectly 
via a switch or HomePlug network (500Mb/s is adequate, 
but 1,300Mb/s is best if your server frequently serves 
multiple streams). 
>> Some NAS drives—including our beloved QNAP—
offer dual Ethernet ports with support for Link Aggregation 
Control Protocol (802.3ad). Pair this with a suitable network

switch (such as TP-Link’s affordable TL-SG2008 model), and you’ll 
boost network throughput when serving multiple connections.

TRANSCODER SETTINGS
There’s a noticeable lag when playing back media over the 
Internet—like it or not, this involves some transcoding, even 
with directly supported formats. To boost responsiveness at the 
expense of quality, log on to your server through your web browser: 
“192.168.x.y:32400/web,” where “192.168.x.y” is the IP address of 
the device running your server. Choose “Settings > Transcoder,” 
and set “Transcoder quality” to “Prefer higher speed encoding.”
>> Plex is also set to transcode an unlimited number of streams—
restrict this to just one or two via the “Maximum simultaneous 
video transcode” drop-down [Image B]. Note: This doesn’t restrict 
Direct Play connections.
5 
OPTIMIZE FOR TRANSPORT
Does Plex struggle to deliver a good stream to certain 
devices? You can use its Media Optimizer tool to make use 
of idle server time, by converting selected media ﬁles to a format 
that will stream using Direct Play, without buffering or dropping 
frames. The process produces a smaller, lower-quality copy of the 
ﬁle in question, which sits alongside the original, and improves 
streaming performance.
>> Don’t optimize your entire library; instead, optimize on 
demand—maybe you’re going away for a few days, and want access 
to three or four TV episodes or movies. To do this, log into the 
server in your web browser, then browse to the movie or episode 
in question. Click the “…” button in the left-hand pane, and choose 
D
“Optimize.” Pick a preset: Mobile, TV, Original, or Custom 
(this latter option lets you choose from more presets, or 
set your own frame rate and resolution). Leave the default 
storage location alone, and click “Optimize” [Image C].
6 
TWEAK OPTIMIZATION SETTINGS
Media is optimized one ﬁle at a time, but you can build 
a queue. Check their progress via the “Conversion” 
tab. To manage optimized versions—allowing you to delete 
some or all of these converted ﬁles to reclaim drive space 
at a later date—go to “Settings > Optimized Versions.”
>> Return to “Settings > Transcoder,” and click “Show 
Advanced.” At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see the 
“Background transcoding x264 preset” setting—it’s set to 
“Very fast” by default, but consider “Super fast,” or even 
“Ultra fast,” if the optimization process is taking too long, 
and you’re not bothered by video quality.
7 
RESTRICT LIBRARY UPDATES
Go to “Settings > Library” to manage how Plex 
updates your media libraries. By default, it monitors 
for new and changed content in your media folders, then 
updates accordingly. This isn’t practical on lower-end 
media servers, such as the Raspberry Pi, so restrict the 
scan to no more than once an hour using the “Update my 
library periodically” option instead. Also consider setting 
“Generate video preview thumbnails” and “Generate 
chapter thumbnails” to “Never” to reclaim more system 
resources [Image D]. 
E
C
An alternative way to access subtitles is to embed them into 
your media using Handbrake. A full guide can be found under 
“Advanced Features” at https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/—but 
it’s basically this: Load up your media, switch to the “Subtitles” 
tab, and either import your .srt ﬁle (you can set an offset if 
required), or click “Add Track” if ripping from DVD. Look for 
a “Foreign Audio Scan” option [Image E], which attempts to 
detect the foreign-language dialog track for you, then check 
both “Forced Only” and “Default” (or “Burn In” if you want the 
subtitles to be physically overlaid on the video track, which 
means they’re visible even if subtitles are switched off). You’ll 
never be bamboozled by Jabba the Hutt again.

Build Your Own
Chromebook
1
CHROMIUM VS. CHROME
The good news is it’s easy to install Chromium OS [Image A], the 
open-source project name for the ofﬁcial Google Chrome OS, 
which is only available through ofﬁcially licensed Chromebook PCs. 
While it looks superﬁcially different, with a blue theme running 
through it, Chromium OS taps into the same Google accounts and 
services, and offers the same advantages of automatically picking 
up your plugins and the rest, which are stored in the Google cloud.
2
CHOOSE YOUR HARDWARE
Built on Gentoo, Chromium OS is Linux-based, so has all the 
advantages of the Linux kernel—but keep in mind it was only 
rolled out in late 2009, so if you’re planning on trying it on hardware 
older than that, you might not have as much luck. Having said 
that, we tried it on a standard Lenovo X200 laptop from 2008, and 
everything worked without a hitch. A general rule of thumb is: Any 
standard Intel hardware should work without trouble. One thing we 
do know is that non-Intel wireless adapters do cause issues; we’ll 
go into this in more detail in a moment.
THE FIRST QUESTION in your head is probably, “Why would I want to install Chrome OS, even on my 
old laptop, when there are perfectly adequate full-fat Linux distros to choose from?” Good question, 
and the answer is that not everyone wants a full-fat distro, nor can everyone use a full-fat distro. 
Part of the success of Chromebooks—and they are successful, with Chromebooks outselling Apple 
Macs in the United States in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016—is their cut-down, lightweight Gentoo-based 
operating system. If you want to give someone easy, no-fuss access to Google services, it should be 
a tempting choice. –NEIL MOHR

PICK A BUILD
A number of websites have maintained builds of 
Chromium OS. It’s unlikely you’ll want to build it 
yourself from source, so there are versions ready for 
VirtualBox, and for running and installing off a USB drive. 
We’re using the build maintained at http://arnoldthebat.
co.uk because it remains current at the time of writing. 
Another popular build can be downloaded from the Hexxeh 
website 
(http://chromeos.hexxeh.net). 
However, 
this 
doesn’t appear to have been updated since April 2013, but 
it does still work.

TAKE CHROMIUM OS FOR A SPIN
You’ve got an array of options for trying Chromium 
OS. The easiest of them is to download an image, 
write it to a USB drive or SD card, and then boot this from 
your laptop or PC. There are live disc versions, too, but with 
writable media, you’re able to save your settings and carry 
the operating system around with you, so you can use it on 
any machine.
5
STEP HEAD STYLE
It’s not advertised within the operating system, 
but there’s a command that easily copies the OS 
partitions to an internal hard drive. This does wipe all 
existing data, but with cheap SSDs, it’s not beyond the 
realms of possibility that you could buy a dedicated drive 
for this project. We did try dual-booting Chromium with 
Linux Mint, but it seems as though Chromium saw this 
as a repair state, and wouldn’t play ball. Let us know if 
you have more luck, because it seems to be a relatively 
straightforward process to recreate the two ROOT-A and 
STATE partitions, then  dd  over these from the USB drive, 
and update Grub.

This part of the walkthrough isn’t strictly 
necessary, and frankly, it’s a pain in the 
butt to implement, because the keys are 
long, and if your font obfuscates “1,” “L” 
and “I,” then it’s a pain to enter as well. 
However, if you want the Chromium Files 
app to work nicely with your external 
Google Drive account, this is the way 
to do it. You ﬁrst need to get the keys 
from 
https://console.developers.google.
com. Under “API,” you need to select 
“Credentials,” followed by “Create New 
Client ID for Installed Applications and 
Other Type,” then select “Create New

Secret key will be listed. The second 
major step is adding the environmental 
variables to Chromium. In Vi, add the 
following three lines to the end of 
the conﬁguration ﬁle, along with your 
new keys.

1. GRAB A BUILD 
Grab the latest special build from http://bit.ly/2bh9TsJ—these 
builds retain all previous drivers, including Broadcom wireless, 
plus untested Realtek and Atheros wireless cards. Note the 
Cx86OS and Camd64OS builds for 32-bit and 64-bit support, so 
ensure you grab the correct version for your hardware to make 
the most of your memory.
2. BOOT MEDIA 
The 7ZIP ﬁle is about 1GB in size, and is a 2.4GB uncompressed 
IMG ﬁle. This needs to be  dd ’d to a suitably large USB device 
or SD card. You are able to run and use Chromium OS from this, 
but installing it on an internal SSD or HDD is the best option for 
speed, obviously:
 $ sudo dd if=<ChromeOSname.img> of=/dev/sdbX bs=4M
3. START CHROMIUM OS 
Boot your laptop with the USB stick. You’ll likely need to do 
the magic F12/Del/Special key to adjust the BIOS/UEFI boot 
priorities. You don’t need to log into an account, as you can use 
the Guest account option. Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open the developer 
Chrome shell Crosh. Type  shell  to open a real Linux shell.
4. INSTALL CHROMIUM OS 
Warning! The next command wipes the entire internal hard

prompted for a password, use “password.” At the shell,  
 $ /usr/sbin/chrome-install --dev /dev/sda  and away the install 
goes. Once complete, remove the USB stick and reboot.
5. GET THE API KEYS 
Everything works, but parts of the OS can’t access Google

developers.google.com, and select “Create Project.” Enable 
Drive API/SDK, Google Maps Geolocation API, and Google Now 
for Chrome API.
6. ADD THE KEYS 
The keys are case-sensitive, so carefully enter them when 
asked for the password, which is “password.” To do this, open 
Crosh,  $ shell ,  $ sudo su ,  $ mount -o remount,rw / ,  $ cd /etc ,

Control the Airﬂow
Within Your Chassis
1
FAN ORIENTATION
The ﬁrst thing you need to identify when it comes to your fans is 
which way pulls air in, and which pushes it out. Most commonly, 
the side with the blades exposed is the intake, and the side with the 
guards will exhaust air around or out of your chassis.
2
STATIC PRESSURE VERSUS AIRFLOW
Identifying a static pressure optimized fan as opposed to an 
airﬂow fan is crucial. An easy way to tell them apart is the 
design and orientation of the fan blades. Fat and wide [Image A]? 
You’re looking at a static pressure fan. Skinny and sleek? That’s 
airﬂow optimized. Static pressure is designed to force air through 
dense or resistive areas, while airﬂow fans push larger quantities 
of air into a chassis at a lower pressure.
3
WHEN TO USE A STATIC PRESSURE FAN
We’ll no doubt divide opinion here. Static pressure fans are 
absolutely fantastic for radiators, AIO coolers, and CPU 
heatsinks. Usually, those pesky air towers and radiators have 
a compact enough arrangement that a static pressure fan can 
easily take advantage of the higher pressure. However, this isn’t 
always the case. For radiators, in particular, it can depend on the 
density of the ﬁns within it, also known as FPI (ﬁns per inch). In 
short, the higher the density, the higher the static pressure you’ll 
need to push cool air through it. Take EKWB’s XE 240mm radiator. 
It’s a thick old girl—coming in at just under 2.4 inches in depth, it 
INTERNAL AIRFLOW; let’s cut the crap—it’s one of the biggest dividers of opinion there is, second 
only to cake or pie. So, why is it so complex? What’s a positive or negative pressure system? Static 
pressure? CFM? What’s that? Well, that’s what we’re here to answer. Whether your woes lie with 
choosing which fans to use to cool your mighty AIO, or with the age-old argument between static 
pressure and high airﬂow fans, don’t you worry—we’ve got your back! 
Is internal airﬂow really that important? In a lot of ways, it’s more vital than people realize; the 
more air you circulate, the better temperatures you’ll have internally, and the more comfortable 
your overclocks will remain in turn. Also, you can wow everyone with your in-depth knowledge of 
fans. Come on—who doesn’t love fan tips? –ZAK STOREY

features an FPI of just 16 [Image B]. However, if you take the 
PE variant, coming in at a meager 1.5 inches, you’ll notice 
it has an FPI of 38. In this scenario, you would be far better 
off using a static pressure fan. However, the ﬁrst radiator 
really wouldn’t see any gains from using one, because the 
density is just too low.
4
WHEN TO USE AN AIRFLOW FAN
This is a little easier to answer now we’ve clariﬁed 
the radiator conundrum. In short, if you’ve 
got absolutely no resistance, unless you’re trying to 
thematically match a build with all the same fans, you 
should always choose an airﬂow optimized fan. It’s not as 
difﬁcult as it sounds—most companies offer both static 
pressure optimized and a standard airﬂow variant of the 
same fan design; Corsair’s AF120 and SP120 series, for 
example. Of course, if your radiator has less than 18 FPI, 
you’ll actually save yourself a few bucks by grabbing that 
airﬂow fan instead of the SP variant, because you won’t see 
any performance beneﬁts with an SP fan.
5
WHAT’S ALL THIS ABOUT RPM?
RPM, or revolutions per minute, applies here exactly 
as it would in a combustion engine. The higher the 
revolutions, the higher the performance, but that comes 
at a price. Noctua’s NF-F12 IPPC fans are a good example. 
They come in two variants (three if you include the IP67 
version): a 3,000rpm version, and a 2,000rpm version. Now, 
the 3,000 variant pushes 109.8 CFM (cubic feet per minute)

for airﬂow, and has a phenomenal static pressure of 7.63mm H2O. 
However, at full whack, you also get a very noisy 43.5dB(A), which 
is bad. Compare that with the 2,000rpm variant, and you’re down 
to 71.7 CFM on airﬂow, and a static pressure rating of 3.94mm H2O. 
The advantage? You’ll be greeted by 29.7dB(A) instead, which is 
around the same as a stock Corsair fan found in the H100i.
6
HOW CAN YOU REDUCE NOISE LEVELS?
Short of buying slower fans (1,500rpm or below), you can use 
low-noise adapters to reduce the voltage powering the fan, 
or use PWM variants instead, so you can control the fan speeds with 
pinprick precision through fan control software on your desktop. You 
could also install fans with rubber grommets [Image C], as opposed 
to the traditional fan screw. Outside of fans, you could opt for a 
noise-optimized case—one that uses sound-dampening material, 
such as Fractal’s Deﬁne R5. Although the side panels will inherently 
be heavier, due to the noise-dampening fabric attached to the 
interior panels, it will deaden any excessive vibrations dramatically. 
Failing that, you could opt to use a fan controller, such as Phantek’s 
PWM fan hub. These work similarly to a low-noise adapter, and 
most enable you to plug both PWM and 3-pin fan headers directly 
into them, which are then controlled by a single header, or software 
on the motherboard itself.
7
WHAT DO ALL THOSE NUMBERS MEAN?
To get a good idea of what these ﬁgures represent, your best 
bet is to compare several different fans on your favorite 
etailer’s website. But for a quick roundup, static pressure is often 
measured in mm H2O (2.2 is the average), higher equals better. 
Airﬂow is measured in CFM (70–80 is the average), higher is still 
better. Noise levels are measured in dB(A), 16 being super-quiet, 30 
being your average CPU cooler fan at full load, 40 being a localized 
D
C
earthquake within your chassis (OK, we jest here, but you 
get the point).
8
PULSE WIDTH MODULATION (PWM)
PWM fans account for about 30 percent of the total 
fans out there today. In short, instead of utilizing 
12V, 7V, or 5V to power the fans, the additional pin [Image D] 
allows the motherboard to ﬂuctuate the amount of voltage 
powering the fan. This way, it can control the fan’s speed 
with incredible accuracy.
9
WHAT’S NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE PRESSURE?
These phrases refer to how you have your case set 
up. It sounds ridiculous, but once you introduce 
fans to a system, you actually create a pressure system 
inside the closed chassis. There are three different types 
of pressure system: a balanced system, where there’s 
just as much air going in as going out (two intakes, two 
exhausts); a negative pressure system, where more air 
is being exhausted than is being brought into the chassis 
(one intake, three exhausts); and a positive pressure 
system, where more air is being brought into the chassis 
than exhausted (three intakes, one exhaust). In reality, they 
are all equally effective at cooling, and you’ll only ﬁnd very 
minor differences between the three. After all, exhausting 
hot air out of your chassis helps keep your motherboard on 
ice and your overclocks steady, and replacing that hot air 
with cold air through an intake helps as well. Ultimately, 
it’s all about air circulation, far more than whether you run 
a positive, negative, or balanced system. 
10
BALANCE IS KEY, THEN?
Well, no—it’s actually more about dust than 
anything else. In today’s world, cases are 
littered with dust ﬁlters: intakes designed to reduce the 
amount of dust entering your system. After all, dust is the 
biggest hardware killer of them all, and for an aesthetic 
build, it looks awful as well. But even with all of those 
ﬁlters, you’re still going to have holes and areas that aren’t 
ﬁltered (rear exhaust slots, PCIe slots, and other gaps in 
the case’s construction). In a negative system, thanks to 
thermodynamics, cool air is pulled in through all of these 
unﬁltered areas, in turn bringing dust into the system. 
However, in a positive system [Image E], air is actually 
exhausted or pushed out of these gaps and unﬁltered 
areas, pushing the dust out of your case as well. It’s not 
going to keep the dust out indeﬁnitely, but it’ll certainly 
help, and it means your system will require a lot less 
maintenance overall.

Create a Clever 
Wall Calendar
1
CRAFTING YOUR CALENDAR
For this project, you need a Raspberry Pi with Internet access 
[Image A]. In the interests of saving on cabling and space, it’s 
best to use the Raspberry Pi 3, which has integrated Wi-Fi.
>> You also need to choose a monitor. One excellent option is 
the Ofﬁcial Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Display (see “Choosing a 
Monitor,” opposite) but any compatible monitor will do. This isn’t 
a DIY tutorial, so please only attempt to mount the Raspberry Pi 
and display if you are comfortable with using a drill and installing 
brackets. If the display comes with a stand, there’s no reason it 
can’t be placed on a desk or table.
>> This is also a good time to start measuring cable lengths, 
so you can be sure both the monitor and the Pi will have power 
wherever they’re mounted. 
>> Once your equipment is in order, you need to consider the type 
of calendar you wish to use. If you and your family or colleagues 
already have a calendar you share, you can start following the 
tutorial right away.
>> If that’s not the case, you may wish to create a single 
calendar for this purpose. If you’re using Google Calendars, you 
can follow the steps at https://support.google.com/calendar/
answer/37095?hl=en to do this. For Mac users, visit https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH2674?locale=en_US to create a new 
iCloud Calendar. Outlook users can also create a calendar by 
visiting http://calendar.live.com. 
>> It’s not particularly important which calendar service you use, 
provided it can be displayed in Mozilla Firefox, which we’re using 
for this project. Try to give the calendar a distinctive name, such as 
“Smith Family Calendar,” so everyone using it knows it’s distinct 
from their personal calendar.
ONE STAPLE IN FUTURISTIC FILMS is that everyone has a handy panel on the wall showing their 
appointments for the day. While we have calendars on our smartphones and tablets, now, thanks to 
the Raspberry Pi, it’s possible to have an economic wall-mounted calendar in your home or ofﬁce.
Given that we have just admitted that we could, for instance, use a calendar app on our phones 
instead, is this just a novelty, or are there any advantages to doing this? Well, mounting your 
calendar on a wall is certainly more aesthetically pleasing than many smartphones, but the main 
advantage is that it enables you to share a calendar with others, by putting it in a public place, 
such as your living room. Your family can see your own appointments, and you can make sure you 
schedule your commitments around theirs. In the workplace, you can use calendar views, such as 
Agenda in Google Calendars, to organize meetings and assign tasks to colleagues. –NATE DRAKE

they belong to [Image B].

previously used a different platform—for example, you

ﬁle by following Step 2 at https://support.google.com/calendar/

CUSTOMIZATION
Once you have a single, shared calendar, take some time 
to set it to a format with which you’re comfortable. Most 
providers have the option of a daily, weekly, or monthly view. 
>> Next, feel free to ﬁne-tune the appearance. You can make 
changes to the iCloud Calendar—for example, to change the 
viewable time period—by following the instructions at https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH2678?locale=en_US. 
>> Google Calendar’s default look and feel is rather spartan. If you 
would like to experiment with different themes, there’s a number 
available 
from 
https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_
terms=google+calendar. However, you need the Stylish Firefox 
extension in order to install them, so visit https://addons.mozilla.
org/en-US/ﬁrefox/addon/stylish/?src=ss, then click “Add to 
Firefox” to install this.
4 
FULL-SCREEN AHEAD
Because you’ll be using a much smaller screen than you’re 
used to, space will be at a premium, so consider installing 
the Real Kiosk (r-kiosk) add-on for Mozilla Firefox. Real Kiosk does 
what it says on the tin: It’s designed to turn your browser into the 
equivalent of an Internet kiosk. This means the menus, 
toolbars, and even the right-click function are disabled. 
The chief advantage of this is that Firefox always opens in 
full-screen mode, making your calendar much easier to 
see. This also makes sure your device can only be used as 
a calendar, because people trying to view other websites 
are bounced back. 
>> If you do need to close down Firefox for any reason, 
you can do this by connecting a keyboard, holding down the 
Alt key, then pressing F4. 
5 
EDITING YOUR CALENDARS
Reading this project so far, it would seem that 
viewing the calendar in the web browser is a passive 
experience. However, if you have a central calendar on 
your wall, wouldn’t it be ideal to let people add and edit 
appointments as well?
>> If you are using the ofﬁcial Raspberry Pi Touchscreen 
Display [Image C], tapping anywhere with your ﬁnger 
simulates moving the mouse and left-clicking in that 
place. You can use this to edit the time of events, and even 
create new ones. 
>> Problems may arise when you want to edit the text of 
events or create names for new ones. Naturally, you could 
connect a small wireless keyboard, and leave it near the 
wall-mounted calendar in case data needs to be entered. 
>> A much less clumsy solution, however, would be to 
have the keyboard built into the browser itself. The Mozilla 
Firefox extension VKeyBoard [Image D] is designed for 
kiosk browsers, and pops up when clicked to allow users 
to enter text. 
>> Simply visit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/ﬁrefox/ 
addon/vkeyboard/?src=search 
inside 
the 
browser, 
and click “Add to Firefox” to install. If you have already 
installed the r-kiosk add-on, and can’t change your web 
page, restart Firefox in safe mode, as outlined above. 
6 
SHARING THE DATES
If you want to use any device besides the Pi to add 
or change appointments in Google Calendar, you 
either need to sign into your Google or iCloud account on 
that device, or share your calendar with others.
>> To share your Google Calendar, follow the steps at 
https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082? 
hl=en. You can send a link to only certain email addresses,

There’s no shortage of suitable small 
monitors to connect to your Raspberry 
Pi. If you feel comfortable with a small 
amount of wiring, the Ofﬁcial Raspberry 
Pi Seven-Inch Touchscreen Display is 
the ideal size to display a calendar, as 
well as having a handy slot at the back 
to place your Pi. The screen, along with 
assembly instructions, is available 
from the Adafruit website for $80  
(www.adafruit.com). 
If you don’t like messy wires all over 
the place, Amazon sells a short micro-
USB power cable for about $3, to allow 
the Raspberry Pi to draw power from the 
monitor’s USB port. 
The Touchscreen Display has the 
added advantage of enabling you to 
scroll through appointments with a click

>> Once your calendar has been shared online, people who wish 
to edit it need to access it from their own devices. For anyone with 
a computer, this is a simple matter of visiting the link, as you would 
on the Pi, by using their browser.
>> It’s also possible to view and edit the calendar on 
smartphones. If the shared calendar is with Google, Android 
users can access it from their own calendar app, even if they 
have a different Google account, by following the instructions at 
https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?co=GENIE.

CALENDAR CONUNDRUMS
If you create or change an appointment, and it 
doesn’t appear right away on everyone’s device, wait 
for 5–10 minutes before attempting troubleshooting, to let 
it percolate through. If the changes are visible on the wall 
calendar—that is, on the website—the issue is most likely 
to do with the device, not the Raspberry Pi. 
>> The software and add-ons used to view the calendar 
are very easy to install, so the most problematic part of this 
project is likely to be when it comes to adding the monitor, 
and ﬁxing it to your wall [Image E].
>> You can make life much easier for yourself by buying a 
monitor speciﬁcally designed for the Raspberry Pi, so you 
have somewhere to put the computer itself.  
>> If the place you want to install the wall calendar is 
hard to reach, you may be able to buy a longer micro-USB 
cable, but bear in mind that the voltage drops as cable 
length grows. Consider using shorter cables and/or a 
powered USB hub.
>> If the Raspberry Pi crashes for any reason, Firefox 
tries to restore all open web pages once it reboots, which 
may mean you have to plug in a mouse or keyboard to close 
down any extra tabs.
>> You can reduce the chance of this happening by starting 
Firefox in safe mode, and then entering “about:conﬁg” in 
the address bar. Press Return to be taken to the settings 
screen for Firefox. 
>> Once you’re there, simply scroll down to the setting 
marked 
“Browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash,” 
and double-click to change from “True” to “False.” 
>> If you are using Google Calendars, anyone who 
scrolls to the top of the screen can switch from your 
calendar to your other Google Apps, such as Gmail. They 
can also use the search bar to view documents stored in 
your Google Drive.
>> If this concerns you, consider setting up a dedicated 
Google account, just for the calendar. You can still access 
and edit the calendar from your own account. 
When the calendar is on your 
wall, the cursor can look 
untidy, especially when using 
a touchscreen. A handy app 
called Unclutter can hide the 
cursor except when it’s being 
moved or you’re touching the 
screen. Open Terminal on 
your Pi (or connect via SSH), 
and run the command  sudo  
 apt-get install unclutter .
In case the Pi crashes, 
and you’re forced to reboot, 
it’s best to have Firefox 
programmed to open 
automatically, saving you 
the trouble of reconnecting 
a keyboard and mouse. 
Open Terminal on your Pi (or 
connect via SSH), and run 
the command  sudo nano  
 /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-  
 pi/autostart . Scroll to the 
bottom of the window and add 
the line  @firefox-esr . Press 
Ctrl-X, then Y, then Return to 
save your changes. 
Finally, to make sure the 
display doesn’t sleep after a 
few minutes, open Terminal 
or connect via SSH once 
again, and run the command  
 sudo nano /etc/lightdm/  
 lightdm.conf . Scroll down 
to where it says  #xserver-  
 command=X  and remove the 
hash at the start of the line. 
Next, put a space after the 
letter  X  and type  -s 0  
 –dpms  . Press Ctrl-X, then 
Y, then Return to save your 
changes, then reboot your 
Raspberry Pi.

SET UP YOUR WALL CALENDAR
1. UPDATE RASPBIAN AND INSTALL FIREFOX
Before you can physically transform your Raspberry Pi into a 
wall calendar, you need to connect the device to the Internet, 
and open the Terminal app. Run  sudo apt-get update  and then 
 sudo apt-get  upgrade  to bring your RPi up to date. Next, 
enter  sudo apt-get install iceweasel  to install Firefox 
Extended Support Release on to your mini computer.
3. SET FIREFOX FOR FULL-SCREEN
This step is optional but recommended. Visit https://addons.
mozilla.org/en-US/ﬁrefox/addon/r-kiosk/ to install the Real 
Kiosk add-on—this disables menus and toolbars. Firefox 
needs to restart for it to work. Remember, you can still close 
the window by connecting a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi, and 
pressing Alt-F4.
5. CONNECT IT UP
The speciﬁc steps to connect your monitor vary from device to 
device. If you are using the ofﬁcial Raspberry Pi Touchscreen 
Display, assembly instructions are available from http://
thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/45295044-
raspberry-pi-7-touch-screen-assembly-guide.
2. SET FIREFOX PREFERENCES
Go to “Menu > Internet > Firefox ESR” to open Firefox. Visit your 
calendar address—http://calendar.google.com, for example—
and sign in if necessary. If Firefox prompts you to remember your 
preferences, say “Yes.” Once you can see your calendar, go to 
“Edit > Preferences,” and click the “Set to Current Page” button 
to make sure Firefox always displays the calendar.
4. PERFORM TWEAKS
Make sure the calendar is in the view you want—for example, 
Monthly. Next, follow the steps in the “Calendar Tweaks and 
Tips” box (opposite) to hide the mouse when not in use, disable 
the RPi’s sleep function, and make Firefox start every time you 
switch on the machine, if you wish. Restart the RPi to ensure your 
changes have taken effect.
6. FINISHING TOUCHES
Once you’ve connected your Raspberry Pi up to a screen, you’ll 
want to position it somewhere that everyone can access. If it’s in 
your home, you’ll probably also want to make it look as good as 
possible. You can let your imagination run wild here—take a look 
online to see what other people have achieved.

Make Some Noise
with Sonic Pi
1
INTRODUCING SONIC PI
Sonic Pi comes preinstalled with Raspbian, but if you have an 
older installation, it’s possible that your version of Sonic Pi is 
quite old. It’s well worth updating the software installed on your Pi 
by opening a terminal, and typing the following:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
>> If you are prompted to conﬁrm installation, please do so. With 
Sonic Pi installed, you can ﬁnd the application in the “Programming” 
menu. Open the interface, and you’ll see that it is split into three 
vertically tiled panes. The top pane [Image B] contains a row of 
buttons that are used to control the playback of your composition, 
save the composition to a ﬁle, and also record the audio to a WAV ﬁle. 
Further buttons are used to reduce the text size of your code, align 
and indent code automatically, and access the Help/Preferences 
system. The center pane [Image C] contains the area in which code 
is written, which is split into a series of workspaces, enabling you 
to write multiple compositions or test logic in a spare workspace 
[Image D]. To the right of the code space is the Preferences area 
[Image E], where conﬁguration changes can be made at the bottom. 
We also have the Help area [Image F], which contains extensive 
help documentation and example compositions.
THIS MONTH, we’re serving up a selection of “phat beats” using nothing more than a Raspberry Pi 
[Image A] and Raspbian (which comes with Sonic Pi preinstalled). This is the personal project of 
Dr Sam Aaron, and the goal of Sonic Pi is to introduce creativity into programming via music, and 
reduce the friction that’s encountered by children learning to code – for example, the alignment and 
indentation of code, and syntax errors. 
Sonic Pi uses the Ruby programming language created in the mid 1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” 
Matsumoto, which was an easy-to-learn and syntax-friendly alternative to the languages of that 
time. Sonic Pi reﬁnes the Ruby language to provide a number of easy-to-use functions that enable 
learning. In this tutorial, we’re teaching the basics of Sonic Pi, then consolidating that knowledge 
with a piece of music. –LES POUNDER

YOUR FIRST NOTES
Let’s start our musical adventure by playing a note. 
In the coding pane, type  play 60 . Now click “Run” 
on the top pane. You should hear the note play brieﬂy. 
What does 60 mean? Well, it refers to the MIDI (Musical 
Instrument Digital Interface) numbering scheme, which 
is used in professional music production to cover the 
protocol by which data is sent to and from computers and 
digital instruments, but it also covers the connection made 
between the devices. The “60” note refers to a “c4” note, 
but we can just use the name of the note instead, so you 
could type play :c4 .
>> If we wanted to play a series of notes, we could type 
out something like:
 play :c4
 sleep 1
 play :g4
 sleep 1
 play :d4
 sleep 1
This is a correct but rather long-winded approach. 
Instead, Sonic Pi enables you to play patterns of notes in 
the same manner with:
 play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
>> Perhaps the notes are a little too slow for you? Well, 
Sonic Pi has you covered. To speed up the playback of a 
composition, we can set the beats per minute (BPM) for 
playing that pattern of notes faster:
 use_bpm 240
 play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
3
USING SYNTHS
OK, we can play a series of notes, but right now, it’s 
not very exciting, so let’s introduce another feature 
of Sonic Pi: synths.
>> Synths enable a note to be played with many different 
instruments, similar to electronic keyboards and other 
digital instruments. So let’s alter our code to use a synth:
 use_synth :dsaw
 play :c4
B
A
82
MAXIMUMPC
R&D
HOW TO 2017
maximumpc.com

>> Click “Run” to hear the difference. Now that we can play a note 
with a synth, let’s put it into a loop to repeat playback. Sonic Pi can 
create an inﬁnite loop using the  loop do...end  construct. Any code 
inside the loop repeats forever. To ensure that your code is properly 
indented, click the “Align” button in the top pane to automatically 
align the code:
 loop do
     use_synth :dsaw
     play :c4
     sleep 1
 end
>> Click “Run” and you hear the c4 note played once per second 
until “Stop” is clicked. But what if we want to iterate a loop for a set 
number of times? Ruby has an easy way to do this:
 2.times do
     use_synth :dsaw
     play :c4
     sleep 1
 end
4 
PLAYING LIVE
Another kind of loop is a live_loop. This is an inﬁnite 
loop to be used when live coding a performance. 
Changes made to code inside a live_loop don’t instantly 
take effect—rather, they require the user to click “Run” 
to instigate the changes the next time the loop is run. 
Live_loops enable the user to create concurrency where 
multiple segments of code are working together to form 
the backdrop of our music. The syntax for a live_loop is 
similar to a standard loop, but requires a name to be given 
C
Dr Sam Aaron is a bright and bubbly 
individual, who knows his craft well and 
loves to show others, so it’s no surprise 
that he’s a big advocate of live coding, 
the practice of coding in front of a live 
audience. Sam was part of the band 
Meta-ex (http://meta-ex.com), along with 
Jonathan Graham. Together they merged 
coding with musical instruments to 
create unique performances, where the 
audience could see the code transform 
to match the tone and pace of the music.
At a recent OpenTech event, we 
saw open data, in the form of natural 
disaster data, being used to shape the 
notes used in a rather eclectic piece of 
music. The piece, co-produced by Leah 
Borromeo and Jamie Perera, used data 
soniﬁcation. However, this wasn’t a 
real-time project, which opens the door 
for Sonic Pi to be used with open data 
in a live coding exhibition. Data from a 
number of sources, such as newspapers, 
weather forecasts, and governments can 
be “mashed” into a live coding musical 
composition that can illustrate the 
subject of the data being used.

to the loop. So, let’s create a loop named “beat,” which incorporates 
the  play_pattern  function that we learned earlier. Then click 
“Run” to play.
 live_loop :beat do
    use_synth :dsaw
    play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
    sleep 1
 end
>> Change the c4 note for an f4 note, and click “Run”—you should 
hear the note change in pitch accordingly. We can also play a 
pattern backward, using Ruby’s handy  .reverse  function, like so:
 live_loop :beat do
    use_synth :dsaw
    play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ].reverse
    sleep 1
 end
5 
RANDOMIZE THINGS
As well as playing notes forward and backward, we can also 
play random notes using two functions:
 play rrand(50, 100)
 play rrand_i(50, 100)
>> The ﬁrst  rrand  can play any note between 50 and 100, 
including any ﬂoating point MIDI values, but the second  
 rrand_i  can only play integer-based MIDI values between 50 
and 100.
>> A common practice in programming is to create a function in 
which we can contain a block of code, then when we wish to use this 
code, we merely call the function by its name:
 deﬁne :loopy do
  use_bpm 480
  use_synth :dsaw
  play_pattern [ :c3, :c4, :c5, :c6 ]
  sleep 0.5
 end
 live_loop :testy do
  loopy
 end
>> In our example, we create a function called “loopy,” 
and use the  do...end  construct to store the code that will 
set the BPM to 480 beats per minute, and play a pattern 
using  dsaw synth , before sleeping for half a second. 
Inside a live_loop, we call the function “loopy” by its name, 
and the code contained inside is run.
6 
USING SAMPLES
The last Sonic Pi concept we’re introducing is 
samples. These are segments of audio that are pre-
recorded, and in the music industry, they are used often 
to embellish a song using clips from classic songs. To 
use a sample in a new live_loop, we need to recreate the 
following code below the existing  live_loop :beat :
 live_loop :samples do
    sample :loop_amen
    sleep sample_duration :loop_amen
 end
>> The sleep statement for this loop is unusual, because 
it doesn’t have an integer or ﬂoat value visible. Rather, we 
instruct Sonic Pi to learn the duration of the sample used, 
and use that as the sleep value.
7 
BUILDING OUR TUNE
Now that we have the basics under our belt, let’s 
start building our composition. Click on a blank 
workspace, and start your piece by creating a live_loop 
called “beat.” This will contain the code that forms the beat 
of our piece. Let’s put a sample inside the live_loop. When 
completed, click “Run” to hear the beat.
 live_loop :beat do
    sample :bd_haus
    sleep 0.5
 end
>> So, our beat is a sample played two times per second, 
which is a BPM of 120—quite quick and punchy. Let’s 
build upon the beat by creating another live_loop, which 
will contain a melody. Before we start the live_loop, we 
add some FX to our audio. To do this, we use the “reverb” 
FX plugin to add a spacious feel to the notes. We pass 
the “room 1” argument to instruct Sonic Pi to use the 
maximum-sized room available—in other words, this gives 
the sound the maximum available spacious sound. This 
melody uses the “beep” synth for any notes played. 
D
Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi has 
become the killer application to teach 
Python to classes, and Sonic Pi has 
attained the same status for its use of 
music. But what if there were a way to 
merge the musicality of Sonic Pi with the 
fun of building new worlds in Minecraft? 
Well, now there is, and from version 2.5 of 
Sonic Pi, you can also integrate Minecraft 
into your musical compositions. At the 
time of writing, this is still a bleeding-
edge feature, but there’s already a 
great deal of functionality available, 
such as getting the position of the player 
or a block, changing the position of 
the player and block type, and posting 
data to the chat window. The syntax 
is exceptionally easy to pick up, and 
integrates seamlessly into the standard 
Sonic Pi syntax structure, enabling 
Minecraft functionality to be added to any 
previously written Sonic Pi compositions.
To use Sonic Pi with Minecraft, simply 
open the Minecraft application, load a 
world, open Sonic Pi 2.5, and choose 
a Minecraft function to trigger the 
connection, such as the chat window:
 mc_chat_post(“Hello World”)
Run the code and—hey presto!—
you’re connected.

USING FX PLUGINS
We then add a seed to the mix, which changes the starting 
point for any random numbers generated by Sonic Pi. 
Numbers generated using “random” are never truly random, 
merely chaotic in nature. We used 66678 as our starting point, but 
try other numbers to see how the composition changes. Next, we 
create a variable called “sound,” and in there we store a scale of 
notes in the key of g3. Next, we instruct Sonic Pi to perform the next 
bank of code 16 times, so it chooses the notes from the “sound” 
variable, then uses a number of arguments to achieve the following: 
Detunes the notes to create a slightly off sound to each note; alters 
the fade out and release of the note, so that it fades quickly; and 
amp controls the level of the note played—in this case, it’s half the 
volume relative to the others. Then, we modify the cutoff to use a 
random note between 70 and 80 to cut off certain frequencies. We 
now instruct the code to wait for 0.125 seconds. Lastly, because we 
have opened three loops using  do , we must close them correctly:
 with_fx :reverb, room: 1  do
  live_loop :melody do
    use_synth :beep
    use_random_seed 66678
    sound = (scale :g3, :major_pentatonic, num_octaves: 3)
    16.times do
      play sound.choose, detune: 6, release: 0.1, amp: 0.5, cutoﬀ: 
 rrand(70, 80)
      sleep 0.125
    end
  end
 end
E
>> Click “Run” to play the composition. Remember that 
you can alter the random seed to produce a different 
sound. You can also alter the scale of notes, by changing 
g3 to another scale—g5, c4, and so on. You can also alter  
 major_pentatonic  to minor_pentatonic , to produce a 
much darker and more sorrowful tone.
9 
THE FINALE
Our next live_loop is used to create an ambience 
to the composition, and again, we’re using an 
FX plugin. This time, it’s “ixi_techno,” a low-pass ﬁlter 
between the minimum and maximum cutoffs. We call the 
loop “ambience,” and ﬁrst off, it performs a block of code 
eight times. Using the “hollow” synth, we play the note 
c3 with an amplitude of 0.5, putting the note into the mid-
tone mix of our composition. We then wait for one second 
before entering into another loop that iterates eight times. 
This time, however, it plays the “ambi_choir,” a haunting 
choir sound, at standard speed, but mixed down into the 
composition, so that it appears as background noise. We 
then sleep for one second, before closing the four loops 
that have been created:
 with_fx :ixi_techno do
  live_loop :ambience do
    8.times do
      use_synth :hollow
      play :c3, amp: 0.5
      sleep 1
      8.times do
        sample :ambi_choir, rate: 1, amp: 0.2
        sleep 1
      end
    end
  end
 end
>> Click “Run” to hear your composition play. Does 
it need any tweaking to match your goal? You could try 
changing the sample playback rate from 1 to 0.5, or to 2 for 
different results.
10 
LET THE MUSIC PLAY!
So, using Sonic Pi and some simple coding, 
we have managed to create a looping piece of 
audio that can be recorded using the “Record” button, and 
uploaded to SoundCloud, or used in your YouTube videos.
>> There are plenty of Sonic Pi examples on the ofﬁcial 
website, just point your browser at http://sonic-pi.net and 
click the “Examples” link. It’s also worth checking out the

Set Up a Chat Server
on Your Raspberry Pi
1
XMPP TO THE RESCUE
The solution to all of the above is XMPP (Extensible Messaging 
and Presence Protocol). XMPP is a communications protocol for 
open-source and secure messaging. Unlike chat software created 
by big corporations, there’s a number of programs you can use to 
connect to a server running XMPP, and you don’t have to share the 
contents of your conversation with anyone except your contacts.
>> There are thousands of public XMPP servers, some run by large 
companies and others by private individuals. The Raspberry Pi can 
easily be used to set up your own XMPP server, to allow your friends, 
co-workers, or family members to connect and chat together.
>> Part of this project was adapted from a guide put together by 
Tomas Greno, which can be viewed at http://bit.ly/2dal1Z7. 
2
WHY XMPP?
Before starting this project, you may be wondering why you 
would even want to set up your own chat server on your 
Raspberry Pi, given the number of alternatives available. You may 
also be questioning why you would choose XMPP, when you could 
use more familiar software, such as Facebook Messenger, or have 
your contacts meet you in an online chatroom. For a full technical 
rundown of the technologies underlying XMPP, you can visit the 
Overview page of the XMPP Foundation at http://bit.ly/2d7XrHV. 
However, in brief, one of the chief advantages of using XMPP to host 
your own chat server is security—your messages will never leave 
the server. So, provided your Raspberry Pi never leaves your home 
or ofﬁce, it will be much more difﬁcult for someone to read your 
chat history. 
>> Even if you allow others to connect to your Pi chat server over the 
Internet, you will be using open-source software, which is regularly 
WITH FACEBOOK CHAT, GOOGLE HANGOUTS, Yahoo Messenger, and ICQ, to name but a few, there’s 
certainly no shortage of chat services available nowadays. The downside of all these offerings is 
that they’re closed-source, meaning the code used to design them is not released to the public. This 
makes it harder to detect security vulnerabilities—plus, you have to trust that big corporates are 
keeping your private conversations safe. 
Federation is also deﬁnitely not supported by most proprietary chat software—for instance, 
someone using the ofﬁcial Google Hangouts app has no way of speaking directly to someone using 
AOL Messenger. So, how can you get around all these problems? Read on…. –NATE DRAKE

See www.raspberrypi.org.
MESSAGING CLIENT 
We’re using Pidgin, available 
from www.pidgin.im.
reviewed by a community of developers, rather than by one 
team at a single company. This means there is a far greater 
chance of vulnerabilities being discovered and ﬁxed. 
>> XMPP is also extremely ﬂexible. Any XMPP server 
that is connected to the Internet can communicate with any 
other user registered with another XMPP server. 
>> For example, if you register a chat account with the 
popular German XMPP server www.jabber.de, you can still 
communicate with someone who has an account with the 
British XMPP server www.xmpp.is. Usernames are written 
in the style of email addresses, such as “hansgruber@
jabber.de,” and you can add them as contacts in your 
messaging app [Image A].
>> There’s a great many XMPP messaging programs 
available for both computers and mobile devices. Apple’s 
Messages for Mac OS X, and the program Empathy, which 
comes preinstalled with many versions of Linux, both 
support the XMPP protocol. For Windows users, it’s very 
easy to download a compatible client.

CHOOSE YOUR MESSAGING CLIENT
To connect to your Pi’s server, we will be using 
Pidgin [Image B], because it’s very ﬂexible and is 
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you’re a Mac or 
Windows user, head over to www.pidgin.im/download to 
download Pidgin Messenger. If you’re using Linux, simply 
install it using your OS’s package management tool. 
>> Although when following the tutorial you will already 
have added an admin account, this shouldn’t be for daily 
use, so we will create a new account when starting Pidgin.
>> When the Pidgin window opens, select “XMPP” under 
“Protocol.” As we’re creating a new account, the username 
can be anything you want. In the “Domain” ﬁeld, put the 
IP address or domain name of your Raspberry Pi, such as 
“192.168.1.2.” The password ﬁeld can contain any value you

Password” box, to save having to log in each time.

appear on your own version of Pidgin, to help you distinguish 
your account—for example, “Roger-Raspberry-Pi.” Check 
“Create a New Account on this Server,” then click “Add.”

PIDGIN PLUGINS
As you will have seen when setting it up, Pidgin supports 
a number of protocols, such as AOL Instant Messenger, 
Google Talk, and Yahoo Messenger. It’s also highly customizable 
through the use of extra plugins [Image C]. Some of these plugins, 
such as Theme Manager, are ofﬁcial, and accessed by clicking 
the “Tools” menu in Pidgin, then “Plugins.” Other plugins have 
been developed by third parties. A full list of third-party plugins, 
as well as instructions for installation, is available from http://
bit.ly/2cof2P1. One particular plugin of note is Off-the-Record 
Messaging (OTR). 
>> In brief, if this plugin is installed in both your copy of Pidgin 
and that of your friends or colleagues, your conversations are 
automatically encrypted. Unlike the SSL certiﬁcate, which is stored 
on the Pi, OTR encryption keys never leave your computer, so even 
the chat server can’t keep a meaningful copy of your transcripts. 
>> If you want to access the chat server securely from a mobile 
device, try ChatSecure. This free app is available for Android and 
iPhone, and supports OTR messaging without needing to install 
extra plugins. More information is available from the Guardian 
Project’s website at http://bit.ly/2cJti6A. 
>> If you are considering opening your Pi chat server to the 
Internet, another useful plugin is Bot Sentry. This prevents you 
from being overwhelmed with spam messages, because you only 
receive messages from people on your buddy list.
>> Once Pidgin is secure, you may want to tweak its appearance, 
so head over to www.pidginthemes.com.

CHAT CHALLENGES
As you’ll see in the walkthrough (overleaf), the 
software is very simple to set up and run. If you are 
having trouble installing the software in the ﬁrst place, 
you should make sure you have the latest version of 
Raspbian. Open Terminal on the Raspberry Pi, or connect 
via SSH, and run the command  sudo apt-get update  then 
 sudo apt-get upgrade . The second command may take 
some time, so make sure you don’t need to use your 
Raspberry Pi urgently before running.
>> As you’re going through the walkthrough, you may 
have difﬁculty ﬁnding the sections you have to edit in the 
conﬁguration ﬁle. Use Ctrl-W to run a search within the 
ﬁle for the sections you need to change—for example, 
“VirtualHost.” Just type your search term and press 
Return to be taken to the word in question. 
>> If you restart the Pi for any reason, the Prosody chat 
service stops. You can get it running again by opening 
B
By default, your chat server will run on your home network only. 
If you want to communicate with people within your own home or 
workplace, there’s no need to open your Pi to the world. 
If you think it would be useful to be able to access the chat 
server from outside your home or ofﬁce, ﬁrst set a static IP 
address for your Pi, if you haven’t already, by following the 
guide at http://bit.ly/2cCHl8F. Next, you need to obtain a ﬁxed IP 
address for your router. Your ISP may be able to do this for you 
for a fee. Alternatively, you can create a hostname that points to 
your home router through a service such as www.noip.com free 
of charge. The next step is to open ports 5222 and 5269 on your 
router. These are the default ports used by XMPP. You need to 
do this from your router’s conﬁguration page. As the steps are 
different for each router, we cannot provide instructions here, 
but you can ﬁnd information on how to forward ports for most 
common routers at www.portforward.com. 
If you do set up a new domain name or IP address for the Pi, be 
sure to follow Step 2 of the walkthrough (overleaf), to update the 
domain name/IP in the “Virtual Hosts” section.
Because people will be connecting over the Internet, you may 
also want to secure your connection with an SSL certiﬁcate. (See 
“Securing Your Chats” box, over the page.)

C
SECURING YOUR CHATS
If you want to be sure your connection 
is safe, you can use an SSL certiﬁcate to 
encrypt the connection each time your 
messaging client passes the password to 
the Raspberry Pi.
If you wish to connect your Pi’s chat 
server to the Internet, it’s best to obtain 
your certiﬁcate from a legitimate certiﬁcate 
authority. This also makes it easier for your 
chat server to authenticate itself to other 
XMPP chat servers over the Internet. 
Alternatively, you can generate your own 
self-signed certiﬁcate. This is generally 
considered less secure, and some XMPP 
messaging programs may refuse to 
connect to it, but it’s easier to set up. First, 
open Terminal on the Pi, or connect via 
SSH, and run the command:
 sudo prosodyctl cert generate  
 yourhostname 
For example:
 sudo prosodyctl cert generate  
 192.168.1.2 
You are asked a series of questions, 
such as your key size, country, and so 
on. Press Return to accept the default 
options, except when you’re asked for the 
“Common Name.” Here, type your chat 
server’s IP address—“192.168.1.2,” for 
example. When done, the system tells 
you where it has stored the CRT ﬁle. Make 
a note of this. Next, open the Prosody 
conﬁguration ﬁle with the command:
 sudo nano /etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua 
Scroll down to the section marked  
 ssl =  and edit with the correct path to 
your ﬁles, such as:
 ssl = {
   key = “/var/lib/prosody/ 
 192.168.1.2.key”;
   certiﬁcate = “/var/lib/prosody/ 
 192.168.1.2.crt”;
 }
Press Ctrl-X, then Y, then hit Return to 
save your changes.
Terminal on the Pi or connecting via SSH and running the command  
 sudo /etc/init.d/prosody start .
6 
MORE TROUBLESHOOTING
If you ﬁnd the software fails to start, try running the 
command  sudo luac -p prosody.cfg.lua  to check the 
conﬁguration ﬁle. If all is well, the Terminal simply goes on to the 
next line when you press Return. Otherwise, it tells you the line 
where there is an error message.
>> If you choose to enable SSL, modify the location of both the 
KEY and CRT ﬁle. If you used the Prosody software to generate a 
self-signed certiﬁcate, this is in the same folder. Some messaging 
clients may display a warning before connecting. This isn’t in itself 
a cause for concern, but it may prevent certain programs from 
being able to connect.
>> If you choose only to access the server from your home or 
ofﬁce network, remember that your conversations are only secure 
if no one can physically access your Raspberry Pi. If you don’t 
use OTR messaging, anyone connected to the network may also 
be able to read your messages by viewing network trafﬁc. See 
https://prosody.im/doc/security for a detailed rundown of possible 
vulnerabilities, as well as suggestions on how to solve them. If 
you do use OTR messaging, bear in mind that chatrooms are not 
currently supported.
7 
VIDEO ISSUES
Voice and video calls are supported by an extension to 
the XMPP protocol known as Jingle. Not all XMPP clients 
support this feature. For instance, voice and video calls are only 
available from the Apple Mac and Linux versions of Pidgin. Linux’s 
built-in messenger, Empathy, also supports Jingle out of 
the box, as does Jitsi, which is available for Linux, Mac, 
and Windows. If your contacts only use Windows, they 
can download a different client, such as Psi (available 
from http://psi-im.org), which may support video calling. 
Alternatively, Windows 10 users can install the Linux 
version of Pidgin via the Windows 10 Bash shell. See http://
bit.ly/1N3Ob2f for details. 
>> If you have a number of users performing large ﬁle 
transfers or video calling, you may notice the chat server 
starts responding more slowly. You can relieve this, at 
least in part, by enabling data compression on your server. 
See the steps outlined at http://bit.ly/2cPVIJI for more 
information. Compression is set on a sliding scale from 
1 to 9, where 9 is the highest, but uses the most system 
resources, which in turn could actually slow the Pi down 
further. We suggest you start at 7, as the Prosody website 
suggests, and increase as necessary. 
8 
SHARE THE LOVE
Although XMPP software is very robust and 
powerful, you may ﬁnd that some people are 
reluctant to join your server because they are more 
familiar with chat services such as Facebook or Google 
Hangouts, and/or they know how to use those clients. 
The best remedy is to provide your contacts with some 
information on the protocol, and what it can do for them. A 
good place to start is the XMPP Foundation’s wiki at http://
bit.ly/2clH7ld. 
>> If you do persuade people to use your chat server, you 
may want to set up a dedicated chatroom for everyone. You 
need to specify this in your conﬁguration ﬁle. Visit http://
bit.ly/2ctr9ZL for details of how to do this. 
>> Prosody is extremely lightweight, which makes it 
ideal for running on the Raspberry Pi. The downside to 
this is that you may need special features that aren’t 
available. One example would be the ability to broadcast 
a message to everyone who is online, which isn’t natively 
supported. Fortunately, there is a large number of add-
ons for Prosody, known as modules. Head over to https://
modules.prosody.im to see a list of those available. If you 
see any you think would be useful, download them to your 
Pi, and follow the steps at http://bit.ly/2ctqpne to install 
them. You may need to restart the Raspberry Pi for the 
module(s) to take effect.

1. INSTALL PROSODY 
Open Terminal on your Raspberry Pi, or connect via SSH, and 
run the command  sudo apt-get install prosody , then press Y 
to conﬁrm you want to install the software on your device. In 
the next step, you’ll need to change your conﬁguration, so run  
 sudo nano /etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua .
2. MODIFY CONFIG FILE 
Scroll to the section labeled “Virtual Hosts” and change  
 example.com  to your domain—for example,  192.168.1.2 . 
Scroll up to the section named “Server Wide Settings” and, 
under“Admins,” change, to  admins = {“admin@yourip”} — for 
example,  admins = {“admin@192.168.1.2”} . Next, search for the 
words “allow_registration” and change to  true . Press Ctrl-X, Y, 
then Return to save and exit.
3. RESTART AND ADD AN ADMINISTRATOR 
Run the command  sudo /etc/init.d/prosody restart  to restart 
Prosody. Next, add an administrator account with the command  
 sudo  prosodyctl adduser admin@yourdomain —for example, 
 sudo prosodyctl adduser  admin@192.168.1.2 . You’re asked 
to type an administrator password. Do so, and press Return. 
Retype the password, then press Return once again.
4. GENERATE AN SSL CERTIFICATE 
This step is optional, but recommended. At this stage, you may 
wish to generate an SSL certificate to allow messaging clients to 
connect securely to your server. Follow the steps in “Securing 
Your Chats” (opposite) to do this.
5. MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE OVER THE INTERNET 
If you only want to use the chat server in your home or ofﬁce, this 
step isn’t necessary. However, if you want to be able to chat to 
people in the world at large, follow the steps outlined in “Opening 
Your Chats to the World Wide Web” (see page 61).
6. CONNECT WITH AN XMPP CLIENT 
Finally, use Pidgin, or another XMPP-compatible program, to 
connect to your chat server. Provide the details to your friends 
or co-workers to make sure that they can connect, too. And that’s 
it—you’re ready to chat away to your heart’s content.

WHAT YOU NEED
If you only have a microphone with an audio jack, try searching 
Amazon or eBay for an inexpensive USB soundcard [Image B], 
which plugs into the USB port at one end, and has an output for 
earphones and a microphone at the other.
>> There’s a number of speech recognition programs available 
for the Raspberry Pi. For this project, we’re using Steven Hickson’s 
Pi AUI Suite, because it’s powerful as well as extremely easy to set 
up and conﬁgure.
2
GETTING STARTED
Once you follow the steps in the walkthrough (overleaf), you 
will be able to start the installer. The Pi AUI Suite gives you a 
choice of a number of programs to install. The ﬁrst question you are 
asked is whether it should install the dependencies. These, quite 
simply, are the ﬁles the Raspberry Pi needs to download for voice 
commands to work, so select “Y” and press Return to agree to this.
>> Next, you are asked if you want to install the PlayVideo 
program, which enables you to use voice commands to launch and 
play video ﬁles. If you choose “Y,” you’re asked to specify the path 
to your media ﬁles—for example, “/home/pi/Videos.” Note that 
upper-case letters are important here. If the path is invalid, the 
program warns you.
>> You’re then asked if you want to install the Downloader 
program, which searches for and automatically downloads ﬁles 
from the Internet for you. If you choose “Y” here, you’re asked to 
provide settings for host, port, username, and password. If you 
aren’t sure of these, press Return for now to choose the default 
IN STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home, Scotty and Dr McCoy are offered the opportunity to use a 
computer, and are somewhat bemused when it fails to respond to voice commands. The ﬁlm was 
made 30 years ago, and voice recognition has taken huge leaps forward since then. The Raspberry 
Pi has not been left out, and with the help of an inexpensive USB microphone [Image A] and some 
suitable software, you too can have your Pi search YouTube, open web pages, launch applications, 
and even respond to questions, simply by speaking.
The Pi has no built-in soundcard or audio jack, so you need a USB microphone or a webcam with 
built-in mic for this project. We tested the software using a Microsoft HD-3000 webcam, but any 
compatible device will do. Visit http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Webcams for a full list of Pi-compatible 
webcams, but be sure that whatever device you choose has an integrated microphone. –NATE DRAKE

options in each case. The following program is Google 
Text to Speech Service, which you may wish to install if you 
want the Pi to read out the content of text ﬁles. In order to 
use this service, the Raspberry Pi needs to be connected 
to the Internet, because it connects to Google’s servers to 
“translate” the text into speech, and then plays an audio 
ﬁle with the Pi’s media player.
>> If you decide to install this, you need a Google account. 
The installer asks you to enter your username. Do so, 
then press Return. You’re then prompted for your Google 
password. Enter this, and press Return again.
3
MORE SOFTWARE OPTIONS
The installer also offers you the chance to install 
Google Voice Commands. This uses Google’s own 
speech recognition service. Again, you’re asked to provide 
your Google username and password to continue. Whether 
or not you choose the Google-speciﬁc software, the 
program also asks whether you want to install the YouTube 
scripts. These tools enable you to speak a phrase such 
as “YouTube ﬂuffy kittens,” which then causes a relevant 
video clip to be played.
>> Finally, the program gives you the option to install 
Voicecommand, which contains some of the more useful 
scripts, such as being able to launch your web browser by 
saying the word “Internet.”
>> The program asks you if you want Voicecommand to 
set itself up automatically. If you experience an error at this 
stage, follow Step 3 of the walkthrough (overleaf).

TWEAK THE SETUP
Once the Voicecommand program is installed, you 
may wish to make a few basic changes to the setup 
before ﬁne-tuning your conﬁguration. 
>> Open Terminal on your Pi or connect via SSH and run 
the command  sudo voicecommand -s .
>> You are asked a series of yes/no questions next. The 
ﬁrst question asks whether you want to permanently set 
the continuous ﬂag. In plain English, the Voicecommand 
program is asking whether, each time you run it, you want 
it to continuously listen for your voice commands. Select 
“Y” for now. Next, you are asked whether you want the 
Voicecommand program to permanently set the verify 
A

ﬂag. Selecting “Y” here means the program expects you to say 
your keyword (by default, the word “Pi”) before responding to your 
commands. This can be useful if you want to set the Raspberry Pi 
to listen continuously, and don’t want it to act on everything you say 
out loud. 
>> The following prompt asks if you want to permanently set the 
ignore ﬂag. This means that if Voicecommand hears a command 
that’s not speciﬁcally listed in your conﬁguration ﬁle, it tries to look 
for a program in your installed applications and run it. For instance, 
if you say the word “leafpad,” which is a notepad application, 
Voicecommand searches for and runs this even if not speciﬁcally 
told to. 
>> We do not recommend you enable this feature. Because you’re 
running Voicecommand as a SuperUser, there’s too much risk that 
you could inadvertently tell the Pi a command that could harm your 
ﬁles. If you want to set up extra apps to work with Voicecommand, 
you can edit the conﬁguration ﬁle in each speciﬁc case. (See “Voice 
Command Tweaks,” over the page, for more information.)
>> Voicecommand then asks you whether you wish to permanently 
set the quiet ﬂag, so it doesn’t give a verbal response when you 
speak. Choose “Y” or “N” as you see ﬁt.
5 
MAKE YOUR PI TALK
Next, you’re asked if you want to change the default duration 
for speech recognition. You should only change this if you’re 
ﬁnding the Pi is having trouble hearing your commands. If you 
choose “Y,” you’re asked to type in a number—this is the number of 
seconds that the Pi listens for a voice command, and the default is 
3. The program then gives you a chance to set up the text-to-speech 
options. Turn up your volume before doing this. The program 
B
attempts to say something, and asks whether you have 
heard it.
>> The default response of the system when responding 
to your keyword is “Yes sir?” Choose “Y” on the next prompt 
to change this, then type in your desired response, such as 
“Yes ma’am?” [Image C]. Press Return when you’re done. 
The system plays back the response for you to conﬁrm 
whether you’re happy with the result.
>> The procedure is the same for the default message 
for when the system receives an unknown command. The 
default response is “Received improper command,” but 
you can change this to something less robotic if you prefer, 
by typing “Y,” then your chosen response—for example, 
“Unknown command.” 
6 
TALK AWAY!
You are now offered the chance to set up the speech 
recognition options. This automatically checks 
whether you have a compatible microphone installed in 
your Raspberry Pi. Voicecommand next asks you whether 
you want the Pi to check your audio threshold for you. 
Make sure there is no background noise, press “Y,” then 
hit Return.
>> It then asks you to speak a command to check that 
it has the correct audio device selected. The program 
automatically determines the right audio threshold for 
you, so type “Y” to choose this.
>> Finally, the Pi asks you if you want to change the 
default keyword (“Pi”) to activate voice commands. Type 
“Y,” then enter your new keyword. Press Return when 
C
Once installation of the Raspberry Pi 
AUI Suite is complete and you have run  
 sudo voicecommand -c  to set it to listen, 
you need to prime it with a keyword. By 
default, the keyword is “Pi,” but feel free 
to alter this to something easier, such as 
the word “Jessie.” 
Next, you should try out a few of the 
built-in voice commands.
YOUTUBE: Saying “YouTube” and a video 
title automatically loads a full-screen 
video of the ﬁrst relevant YouTube clip. 
This is similar to Google’s “I’m feeling 
lucky.” Say “YouTube” and the name of 
the video in which you’re interested—for 
example, “YouTube ﬂuffy kittens.”
INTERNET: Saying the word “Internet” 
launches your web browser. By default, 
this is the Pi’s built-in browser Midori, 
although you can change this. 
DOWNLOAD: Saying the word “download” 
plus a search term automatically 
searches the Pirate Bay website for the 
ﬁle in question—for example, you could 
say “Download Ubuntu Yakkety Yak” 
to get the latest version of the Ubuntu 
Linux operating system. 
PLAY: This command uses the built-in 
media player to play a music or video 
ﬁle—for example, “Play mozartconcert.
mp4” would play that particular ﬁle 
located in the media folder you speciﬁed 
in setup, such as /home/pi/Videos. 
SHOW ME: Saying “show me” opens up 
a folder of your choice. By default, the 
command doesn’t go to a valid folder, so 
you need to edit your conﬁguration ﬁle  
to a valid location—for example,  
 show me==/home/pi/Documents .
BASIC VOICE COMMANDS

MAXIMUMPC
maximumpc.com
HOW TO 2017

D
Once your Voicecommand software is up and running, you can 
edit the conﬁguration ﬁle to add new commands or modify 
existing ones.
Run the command  sudo nano /root/.commands.conf  to 
view the configuration file. As you’ll see, most of the lines 
begin with a  #  symbol, which means the Pi ignores them. 
Delete the symbol to activate the line. If, for instance, you want 
to change the keyword that activates the voice recognition 
software from “Pi” to “Jessie,” you would change the line from  
 #!keyword==pi  to  -!keyword=jessie .
If you use the Firefox web browser instead of Midori on your 
Raspberry Pi, you may also want to change  ~Internet==midori &    
to  ~Internet==firefox-esr & .
The software can run any command. For instance, to open the 
desktop by saying the word “desktop,” add the following line to 
the end of the file:  desktop==home/pi/Desktop . You can also 
launch programs as you would from the terminal—for example,  
 notepad==leafpad .
As you’re talking to your Raspberry Pi, you may want it to 
respond to you with speech. Do this ﬁrst by opening Terminal 
and installing the speech synthesis software Festival with the 
following command:
 sudo apt-get install festival
The basic format to get the Raspberry Pi to talk is  echo “Your  
 message here” | festival –tts . You can also have the Pi read out 
system information. For example, if you wanted the Pi to tell you 
the date and time, you would need to add the following line to the 
config file:

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
Once the Download program is installed, if you 
experience an error connecting, bear in mind 
that access to the certain torrent sites may be restricted 
where you are. In order to download ﬁles, you also 
need a BitTorrent client for the Pi, such as the program 
Transmission. You can install this by opening Terminal or 
connecting to your Pi over SSH and running the command  
 sudo apt-get install transmission . Help with getting 
started and how to use the client is available from the 
Transmission website at https://forum.transmissionbt.
com. Needless to say, you should only download ﬁles with 
the permission of the copyright holder. 
>> If you choose to use Google Voice Commands or Google 
TTS (Text to Speech), bear in mind that anything you say 
and any text ﬁles you submit are sent to Google’s servers 
for translation. Google claims not to retain any of this data, 
but even if it is to be believed, any data transmitted over 
the Internet can potentially be intercepted by a third party. 
Google does encrypt your connection to reduce the chance 
of this happening, however. 
>> If you ﬁnd you’re happy with the voice command feature, 
you might prefer the software to start automatically each 
time you boot the Pi. If so, open Terminal on your Pi or 
connect via SSH and run the following command:
 nsudo nano /etc/rc.local
>> This opens the ﬁle that determines which processes 
start up when your Raspberry Pi boots. By default, this 
script does nothing. Use your arrow keys to scroll to the 
bottom of the ﬁle and, just above the line reading  exit 0 , 
type the following:
 sudo voicecommand -c
>> Press Ctrl-X, then Y, then Return to save your changes. 
Feel free to reboot the Pi at this stage to make sure it 
works. If you’re unsure whether Voicecommand is running, 
open Terminal and run the command  ps -a  to show a list of 
running processes. 
done. You are then asked to speak your keyword to acclimatize 
the Pi to your speaking voice. If this seems correct, type “Y” to 
complete the setup. Follow Step 6 of the tutorial opposite to run 
the Voicecommand software. Try to start out with a few simple 
commands. (See “Basic Voice Commands,” on the previous page, 
for more information.) Once you’re comfortable with these, run the 
command  sudo killall voicecommand  to shut down the program, 
and edit your conﬁguration ﬁle if you wish. 
7 
VEXING VOICES
Voice recognition software is a work in progress, and the 
Pi may not recognize everything you say. To improve your 
chances, be sure to stay near the USB microphone, and speak 
slowly and clearly. 
>> If you’re still having trouble being understood, open Terminal 
on your Pi or connect via SSH and run the command  alsamixer 
to open your sound settings. Press F4 to choose audio input, then 
press F6. Use the arrow keys to select your USB device, then press 
Return. This controls the volume of your USB microphone. Use the 
up arrow to push it to maximum (100) [Image D]. 
>> If your USB microphone isn’t being detected at all, it might 
need more power than the Raspberry Pi’s USB ports can provide 
on their own. The best solution to get round this is to use a powered 
USB hub. The Pi Supply website sells a seven-port powered hub 
for just $13 (http://bit.ly/2c8H10y). A powered USB hub can also

Open Terminal on your Raspberry Pi or connect via SSH and 
download the installation files by running the command  git  
 clone git: //github.com/StevenHickson/PiAUISuite.git . When 
the download is complete run  cd PiAUISuite/Install  to open the 
installation directory.
2. RUN THE INSTALLER 
Use the command  sudo ./InstallAUISuite.sh  to run the text 
installer. Choose  y  to install any dependencies, and then work 
your way through the installation wizard. See the main article 
for more details about how to do this.
3. INSTALL BOOST C++ LIBRARY 
If you encounter an error when trying to set up the Voicecommand 
program, run  sudo apt-get install libboost-regex1.49.0  to install 
the necessary software. Next, run  sudo ./InstallAUISuite.sh  to 
run the installer again.
4. COPY CONFIGURATION FILES 
Because you’re going to be running the Voicecommand program

Create a Pi Cloud
with OwnCloud
1
ESSENTIAL GEAR
You’re still reading, so we assume you are interested in doing 
this. The three things you need are: an always-on computer, 
some suitable software, and a decent amount of storage space. 
The ﬁrst one could be any Linux computer you leave turned on, but 
we are going to use a Raspberry Pi for this [Image A]. It’s ideally 
suited for the low-powered, always-on needs of a home network. 
You may have heard of the software, it’s called OwnCloud (www.
owncloud.org), and for the storage space, you need to add some to 
the Raspberry Pi. For initial testing, a decent-sized SD card will give 
sufﬁcient storage. As your storage needs grow, a USB external disk 
may be called for.
2
SETTING UP THE PI
We are going to use the latest version of Raspbian on the Pi, 
although these instructions work with any distro based on 
Debian, so you could equally follow them on an Ubuntu desktop. 
Download the latest Raspbian Lite image from www.raspberrypi.
org/downloads/raspbian, and copy it to an SD card. Then put in it 
the Raspberry Pi, and ﬁre it up. Raspbian Lite is a headless version, 
which means all commands are entered in an SSH session, so open 
a terminal on your computer, and run:
 $ ssh pi@IP-ADDRESS
using the IP address of your Pi. The default password is “raspberry,” 
so the ﬁrst thing to do is run:
 $ sudo raspi-conﬁg
and change the password to something else. Then select the option 
to resize the ﬁlesystem to ﬁt your SD card. You should also go into 
the advanced options section, and give the Pi a hostname. When 
you exit raspi-conﬁg and reboot, it should then be accessible using 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF CLOUD ﬁle storage and sharing services, so why would you want the 
hassle of setting up your own? There are many reasons, beyond the perfectly acceptable 
“because you can.” Commercial services have limits on the amount of data you can store. They 
may or may not encrypt your data, but it is their encryption—you can’t be sure that they can’t read 
it. If you’re sharing between computers on the same network, your data still has to go to their 
server, over a relatively slow upstream link, before it can be downloaded to another computer 
in the next room. On the other hand, commercial providers have large data farms, with plenty 
of redundant storage and connectivity, and, usually, comprehensive backup procedures. If you 
want to run your own cloud storage, you have to take responsibility for that. –NEIL BOTHWICK

the hostname you gave it (although this does depend on 
your router).
>> Your Raspberry Pi is assigned an IP address by your 
router’s DHCP server. While such addresses are assigned 
dynamically, DHCP servers generally remember which 
address they gave to which hardware, and give the same 
one each time. You can set up your server to use a static 
IP address, of course, but it’s generally not necessary, 
especially if you set a hostname in raspi-conﬁg to give the 
Raspberry Pi a useful name. This is the local address we 
are talking about—some sort of static address or domain 
is needed if you want to be able to connect to your cloud 
storage from outside of your network. If you don’t have a 
static address, one of the dynamic DNS services would 
be useful.
3
INSTALL A WEB SERVER
OwnCloud is a web application [Image B], so it needs 
a web server to run it. Apache is the most popular 
web server, but it’s a bit heavyweight for a Pi, especially 
as we don’t need all its capabilities. Lightweight, but very 
functional, alternatives include lighttpd (www.lighttpd.
net) and Nginx (http://nginx.org)—we are using the former 
here. SSH into your Pi, make sure everything is up to date, 
then install lighttpd (known to its friends as “lighty”), and 
the required PHP modules with:
 $ apt-get update
 $ apt-get upgrade
A
B

MAXIMUMPC
R&D
HOW TO 2017

 $ apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi php5-gd php5-curl php5- 
 sqlite
>> Now point a browser at http://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-PI>, and you’ll 
see the lighttpd placeholder page [Image C]. We’ll disable access to 
this later on, after we’ve set up the homepage.
>> Now it’s time to install OwnCloud, which is basically a case 
of unpacking the tarball into the web server’s DocumentRoot— 
the directory from which it serves ﬁles. In the Raspbian install of 
lighttpd, this is /var/www/html, so unpack the tarball with:
 $ sudo tar -C /var/www/html -xf owncloud-9.0.2.tar.bz2
4 
INSTALLING OWNCLOUD
OwnCloud 
defaults 
to 
storing 
its 
data 
inside 
its 
DocumentRoot, which isn’t particularly secure. It’s safer to 
create a directory elsewhere for this, and make it owned by the user 
running the web server—www-data for Debian systems.
 $ sudo mkdir -p /var/owncloud/data
 $ sudo chown -R www-data: /var/owncloud
>> The server also needs write access to some directories in the 
DocumentRoot, which you do with this command:
 $ sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/html/owncloud/ 
 {apps,conﬁg,themes,updater,.user.ini}
>> Don’t be tempted to simply chown the whole Owncloud 
directory; it’s more secure if you only allow the web server to write 
to the directories it needs to. If you try to open http://IP-ADDRESS/
owncloud in your browser, you get a “Forbidden” error, so there’s 
clearly some more conﬁguration to do. There are various pre-made 
conﬁgurations in /etc/lighttpd/conf-available. You enable 
them with the  lighttpd-enable-mod  command, which 
symlinks them into the conf-enabled directory. Run:
 $ sudo lighttpd-enable-mod accesslog
 $ sudo lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi
 $ sudo lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi-php
then restart the server with:
 $ sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
and reload the page in your browser. Here you are asked 
to create an admin user and password, Click on “Storage 
& database” below this, and change the data folder to /var/
owncloud/data. After a bit of whirring and clicking (well, 
the Pi is silent, but that’s what it feels like), the OwnCloud 
homepage shows up. At this point, you can create folders 
and upload ﬁles by clicking the “+” icon above the ﬁle list.
>> At the top-right of the display, you will see your 
username as a drop-down menu. As your user is also the 
admin, this menu has extra options—for example, you can 
create users and groups (these are for OwnCloud only, not 
to be confused with system users and groups). There is 
also an admin option, and selecting this loads a page with 
various settings and a couple of warnings at the top. The 
ﬁrst warns you that you are using HTTP and not HTTPS to 
transfer ﬁles. This is not a problem if you are only running 
OwnCloud on your private LAN, and it does make life a little 
easier for the Pi. If you are sharing ﬁles over the Internet, 
using HTTPS is a good idea, and is covered later on.
5 
OWNCLOUD ADMIN
The other warning is about a memory cache. This 
isn’t required, but does speed things up. To set this 
up, install the APCu (Alternative PHP Cache) program and 
then restart the server:
 $ sudo apt-get install php5-apcu
 $ sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
>> Then enable the cache in OwnCloud by editing  
/var/www/html/owncloud/conﬁg/conﬁg.php and adding 
 ‘memcache.local’ => ‘\OC\Memcache\APCu  to the end 
of the ﬁle, just before the ﬁnal closing parenthesis. After 
editing, the end of the ﬁle should look like:
 ‘installed’ => true,
 ‘memcache.local’ => ‘\OC\Memcache\APCu’,
 );
As well as a web server, OwnCloud also 
needs a database. You have two main 
choices here: MySQL or SQLite. SQLite 
is simple and lightweight, and perfectly 
sufﬁcient for a small home setup, and 
that’s what we’ve used in the instructions 
here. There are a few reasons for using 
MySQL instead, however—for instance, 
you may want a larger setup serving 
several users, or you are already 
running MySQL on your computer, in 
which case, it’s more efﬁcient to use a 
single database server.
It’s also recommended that you use 
MySQL if you want to use the desktop 
sync clients. If you want to use MySQL, 
it’s easiest to do this right from the start 
by running
 $ sudo apt-get install php5-mysql
when you install the rest of the PHP 
components. If this also installs MySQL 
for the ﬁrst time, you are prompted for 
an admin password for the database—
don’t forget it. When you load OwnCloud 
for the ﬁrst time, the database options 
include MySQL, where you can pick a 
database name, along with a username 
and password. These are used only by 
OwnCloud for accessing the database—
don’t use your normal login details. If 
you start with SQLite, and later decide 
to switch to MySQL, the OwnCloud 
command-line tool, occ, has an option to 
make the conversion for you:
 $ sudo -u www-data php occ  
 db:convert-type --all-apps mysql  
 oc_admin 127.0.0.1 ownclouddb
You run it as the user owning the 
existing database— --all-apps  simply 
tells it to convert all apps, not just the 
enabled ones. The following options are 
the type of database to create (mysql), 
the username to admin that database, its 
IP address, and the name of the database 
itself. This creates a suitable database in 
MySQL, migrates your data, and also 
alters OwnCloud’s conﬁguration to use 
that database.

When you went into the Apps section to add the documents 
app, you may have noticed a lot of other apps. Most of the 
apps are installed but not enabled. You can either browse the 
categories, or use the search option to ﬁnd interesting apps, 
then you just need to hit each app’s “Enable” button to make 
it available.
The Productivity section includes the usual calendar, 
contacts, bookmarks, notes, and to-do list type apps, but 
there are more available, including an email client, so 
OwnCloud can double as your webmail, too. There is already 
a photo gallery app in the default OwnCloud setup, but the 
Multimedia section includes an enhanced option, as well as 
a music player. All of this can be shared with other users as 
you desire.
APPS GALORE

SECURING ACCESS
OwnCloud already has usernames and passwords to control 
access, but if you are going to open your OwnCloud setup to 
the world at large, you need to take some extra precautions. First 
of all, the advice to locate the data directory outside of the web 
server’s scope becomes even more important. If you cannot do this 
for any reason, you can disable access to it by lighttpd by editing  
/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf, and adding:
 $HTTP[“url”] =~ “^/owncloud/data/” {
   url.access-deny = (“”)
 }
>> This blocks all access to the data directory. Then you should 
disable all directory listings by adding:
 $HTTP[“url”] =~ “^/owncloud($|/)” {
   dir-listing.activate = “disable”
 }
>> OwnCloud includes an Apache .htaccess ﬁle to implement 
these measures, but lighttpd does not use .htaccess ﬁles, so you 
have to put everything in the conﬁguration ﬁle, then restart the 
server. Many server administrators discourage the use of .htaccess 
anyway, as it means every page load causes them all to be parsed 
again, while conﬁguration ﬁles load only once at startup.
>> The other important step for remote usage is to use HTTPS 
instead of HTTP. You can do this with a self-signed certiﬁcate. First, 
you need to create a certiﬁcate:
 $ cd /etc/lighttpd
 $ sudo openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server. 
 pem -days 365 -nodes
 $ sudo chmod 400 server.pem
 $ sudo lighttpd-enable-mod ssl
>> While you’re at it, add HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) 
by creating the ﬁle conf-enabled/10-hsts.conf, containing:
D
 server.modules += ( “mod_setenv” )
 $HTTP[“scheme”] == “https” {
   setenv.add-response-header = ( “Strict-Transport- 
 Security” => “max-age=31536000”)
 }
>> You can change the name and location of the certiﬁcate 
ﬁle as long as you edit the setting for sss.pemﬁle in 10-ssl.
conf to match. Using a self-signed certiﬁcate causes your 
browser to warn you, until you add an exception, but if you 
are only using it to access your own ﬁles from outside, 
that isn’t an issue. For more serious use, a proper SSL 
certiﬁcate is a better idea. Once you restart the server, you 
can access it as https://your.server/owncloud.
>> You also have to conﬁgure your router to forward 
the relevant incoming port to your OwnCloud server. This 
is normally port 80 for HTTP, and port 443 for HTTPS. If 
you want to enforce HTTPS usage when connecting from 
outside, only forward port 443 on your router.
>> There is another way to handle access from outside: 
to use a VPN. It is beyond the scope of this article to explain 
how to do that, but if you regularly connect to your network 
from outside, running OpenVPN or using a service such 
as ZeroTier One saves you having to set up and secure for 
external access for each of your services.

EXPLORING OWNCLOUD
So, you have set up OwnCloud, and you can upload 
and download ﬁles, but you could do that with just a 
web server. What makes OwnCloud useful are its abilities 
to share ﬁles and other data. Click on the drop-down menu 
by your user name, and go to the “Users” page to create 
users and groups. Each user has their own password, and 
96
MAXIMUMPC
R&D
HOW TO 2017

just as with the Linux system, they can be collected into groups. 
Once you have created a user, you can share folders and ﬁles with 
them. Click on the share icon to the right of the ﬁle or folder name 
to open the sharing pane. Type part of a user or group name to see 
a list of matches, then select the one you want. It’s also possible to 
share with a user on another OwnCloud server by typing “user@
server.address/owncloud.” Once you have added a user to share 
with, a number of checkboxes enable you to specify what they can 
do with that share: whether they can re-share it with others, and 
whether they can edit, overwrite, or delete ﬁles you created.
>> If you just want someone to be able to download a ﬁle, without 
giving them access to the rest of your OwnCloud, check the “Share 
link” box; this gives you a URL that you can pass to them to view or 
download the ﬁle directly. If you are concerned about others using 
this link, you can password-protect it or set an expiry date.
8 
COLLABORATION
Being able to let others view and upload ﬁles is good, but 
OwnCloud also allows for collaboration [Image D]. At the 
moment, this is limited to word processor documents in ODT, 
DOC, and DOCX format. The ﬁrst step is to enable the Documents 
app: select “Apps” from the drop-down menu at the top-left of 
the display, type “documents” in the search box, then press the 
“Enable” button for the app. Go back to the drop-down menu, and 
you’ll see a new option for “Documents.” From here, you can open 
an existing document, create a new one, or upload one from your 
computer. See the “Share” button at the top of the word processor 
display? Avoid it, as it doesn’t work in the current release. Instead, 
go back to the “Files” view, and share the ﬁle from there. Make sure 
you enable the “Can edit” and “Can change” options, then each user 
can open the ﬁle in their Documents app, and make changes. As 
other users edit the ﬁle, you can see the changes in your editor, 
color-coded to show which user made which change [Image E].
9 
KEEPING IN SYNC
Keeping your cloud documents synchronized with your 
desktop and mobile computers is easy, as there are 
synchronization programs for the three major desktop operating 
systems (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, and Fedora), as well as Windows and 
Mac, along with mobile apps for various platforms. Install them 
in the usual way, then add an account with your server address 
and login details. As with the browser access, if you are using a 
self-signed SSL certiﬁcate, you are asked whether to accept it the 
ﬁrst time you connect. Then you can choose which folders to sync 
between the computer and server. The default is to keep a copy 
of everything on the server in ~/ownCloud, but you can choose 
individual directories to sync. You can sync whichever 
folders you want; there is no arbitrary limit as with most 
commercially provided servers, especially their free 
versions. Once set up, the desktop client [Image F] sits in 
the system tray, and notiﬁes you when ﬁles are updated. 
Setting up the mobile clients is similar, but if you want to 
be able to sync when out and about, you need to set up your 
router, and OwnCloud, for external access.
>> There’s a couple of tweaks you may want to make. We 
mentioned disabling the lighttpd placeholder page: You 
can delete the index.lighttpd.html placeholder ﬁle from the 
DocumentRoot, then prevent any directory listings of that 
URL by adding this to /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf:
 $HTTP[“url”] =~ “^/$” {
   dir-listing.activate = “disable”
 }
>> The default maximum ﬁle upload size is 512MB, which 
is possibly sufﬁcient for Internet use, but you may want to 
exchange larger ﬁles over your LAN. You can change the 
limit in the “File Handling” section of the “Admin” page. If 
you see a message about missing permissions, make sure 
owncloud/.user.ini is owned by www-data, and restart the 
server. It may take a few minutes for this change to take 
effect. If you start uploading large ﬁles, you’ll soon ﬁll 
the Pi’s SD card. If you attach a USB hard drive, copy the 
contents of /var/owncloud/data to the drive, then mount the 
drive at /var/owncloud/data, you can have as much space 
as you want. That should get you started with OwnCloud, 
but there are plenty of other options to explore.
