Acknowledgments
I want to thank Carol Long for sending the tweet that got this all started and for being a great 
Acquisitions Editor/hockey mom through the entire process; the whole Wiley team, in particular 
the editorial staff headed by Ed Connor, Kim Cofer who made sure my that’s and which’s were right 
way round and my voice was active, and Mike Little for his indispensable technical editing; Doris 
Michaels for pointing me to my wonderful agent, Carole Jelen, who’s been so supportive; friends like 
Karen Hollowell who got me addicted to 3x5 note cards and was my Canadian/American cultural 
attaché, Ann Douglas for running the mother of all author support lines, Peggy Richardson for her 
insights into the art of writing books and for doing some research, and Angela Crocker for all her sup-
port; the programmers who make WordPress possible, and the WordPress community, from whom I’ve 
learned and continue to learn so much; and ﬁ nally I want to thank all my clients over the years who, 
by asking great questions, have helped me learn to explain things more clearly.

Introduction
While WordPress is currently the world’s number one blogging software, this is not a book about 
blogging. In WordPress 24-Hour Trainer, you learn how to use this open-source software to build and 
maintain a website, whether it’s a blog, has a blogging section, or has nothing at all to do with blog-
ging. I treat WordPress as a content management system — a system you can customize in a number 
of ways to make it do exactly what you need.
Whether you’re building a website for yourself or for someone else, you need to be concerned about two 
things: the ease of setting up the site and of maintaining it. This book will show you how WordPress 
offers both. 
Website owners also face two growing challenges: the demand for ever-changing features and for 
ever-growing content. Both require a framework that makes the expansion of content fast and easy, and 
accommodates technological change quickly and easily. WordPress is well-positioned to meet these 
challenges and that, combined with its increasing popularity, makes it software well worth learning.
Since I began building websites exclusively with WordPress, I’ve noticed an important change in my cli-
ents: they look forward to updating and expanding their sites. When changing some text, let alone add-
ing a new page, is like pulling teeth, you’re less likely to do it. With WordPress, not only are my clients 
making their own changes, but they’re excited about it and that’s also made them more involved in their 
sites. Instead of having a site built and then sitting back, my clients are actively thinking about what 
they can change or add to make their sites better because they can go in and do it themselves when the 
thought strikes them.
That’s the real power of WordPress: putting more control in the hands of the website owner.
Who This Book Is For
This book is for beginners at two levels: those who’ve never built a website and those who’ve never 
built a WordPress website.
This book also assumes that you’re using what’s sometimes called the self-hosted version of WordPress, 
which means that you or someone else has installed WordPress on your hosting provider’s server. The 
self-hosted version is not to be confused with the free, hosted blogs you can sign up for at WordPress.com. 
While much of WordPress 24-Hour Trainer applies to the hosted version (how to enter content, how to upload 
photos and documents, how to layout content, and so on) the important difference is that you have very 
limited choices to customize blogs on WordPress.com.
What This Book Covers
As of the writing of this book, the most recent version of WordPress is 2.8 and I cover the latest features 
available in it. However, anyone running 2.7 (apart from being strongly advised to upgrade) will ﬁ nd 
only small differences with the interface and most of the features are the same as well. Users of 2.6 (you 

Introduction
xxiv
should upgrade too) will still get a lot of out of the book, though visually the interface is different and not 
all of the features will be available. Still, the basics of organizing and entering content are all there.
You’ll learn how to set up a WordPress website from scratch, using the default features of the software. 
Each lesson covers a speciﬁ c set of topics, so you can follow the lessons in order but you can easily dip 
into any one of them to refresh your memory. Later in the book I cover some customization of the look 
of the site as well as the addition of plugins, which are bits of code that add extra features to WordPress.
Keep in mind, this book is not what I call an extended manual. It does not aim to cover every feature 
of WordPress. Instead you’ll learn how to make the software work for you in real-world situations, and 
we do that through showing you not just the basics, but the tips and tricks that make things as simple 
as possible. We do that both in print and on video; because seeing something done in real-time makes 
things clearer and helps reinforce the concept.
How This Book Is Structured
This book consists of short lessons covering tasks you’ll typically need when building and maintaining 
a website with WordPress. This means that not every feature of WordPress is covered — I’ll provide 
links to places on the Web where you can get that kind of detailed reference material. The goal here is 
to show you the key skills you’ll use every day.
The 37 lessons are grouped into themed sections:
Section 1: Before You Start
 
❑
 — Get to know how WordPress thinks about content and what 
planning you need to do before starting your site.
Section 2: Firing Up WordPress
 
❑
 — Instructions for installing the software, an overview of the 
administration interface, and the basic settings you’ll need to get going.
Section 3: Working with Written Content
 
❑
 — Entering your content and publishing it.
Section 4: Working with Media Content
 
❑
 — The ins and outs of uploading images, video, docu-
ments, etc. and using them on your site.
Section 5: Managing Your Content
 
❑
 — Navigating through various types of content, editing it, 
moving it around.
Section 6: Making Your Site Social
 
❑
 — Dealing with links, comments, RSS feeds, social net-
working, and multiple users.
Section 7: Customizing the Look of Your Site
 
❑
 — Some basics for making the site look exactly 
the way you want using CSS style sheets.
Section 8: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
 
❑
 — Basic techniques for optimizing your site so 
that you get indexed in the best possible way.
Section 9: Housekeeping Chores
 
❑
 — Keeping an eye on your site statistics, making sure your 
software is up to date, and getting into good backup habits.
Section 10: Extending WordPress
 
❑
 — Extending the power and possibilities of WordPress using 
these addon bits of software.

When you’re ﬁ nished reading the book and watching the DVD, you’ll ﬁ nd lots of support in the p2p 
forums, as you’ll see in a moment, but there’s also the WordPress community on the Web. Hundreds of 
thousands of people around the world are using this software and a lot of them give back in so many 
ways. It’s a spirit that’s reﬂ ected in the quality of WordPress and its continued improvement.
From the people who created and maintain WordPress, to the people who make plugins and themes, to 
the people who write about WordPress on their blogs or contribute to the ofﬁ cial and unofﬁ cial forums, 
there are thousands of bright minds giving back to the community with code, ideas, ﬁ xes, and more. 
You never have to feel you’re alone when you’re using WordPress. I like to think of it as a world-wide 
24-hour help line. Whether you need help or can offer help, you’re welcome any time.
Instructional Videos On DVD
As I mentioned earlier, learning is often enhanced by seeing in real-time what’s being taught, which is 
why most lessons in the book have a corresponding video tutorial on the accompanying DVD. And of 
course it’s vital that you play along at home — ﬁ re up WordPress and try out what you read in the book 
and watch on the videos. 
Conventions
To help you get the most from the text and keep track of what’s happening, we’ve used a number of 
conventions throughout the book.
Boxes like this one hold important, not-to-be forgotten information that is directly 
relevant to the surrounding text.
Notes, tips, hints, tricks, and asides to the current discussion are offset and placed in italics like this.
References like this one point you to the DVD to watch the instructional video 
that accompanies a given lesson.
As for styles in the text:
We

Thinking Like WordPress
WordPress provides you with the tools to organize your website content, but those tools function 
in speciﬁ c ways, just as one type of word processing software has its speciﬁ c buttons for creating, 
say, lists. But there’s a difference between knowing which button to press to create a list and think-
ing about ways you can use lists in your documents. That’s what this chapter is about: learning to 
think like WordPress so that you can organize your content in an efﬁ cient and ﬂ exible manner 
right from the start, and be able to use it in new and useful ways later.
Dynamic vs. Static Websites
When you open a website in your browser, you see a single page ﬁ lled with text and media (graph-
ics, photos, video, and so on) like the page in a magazine or newspaper is a single entity made up 
of text and images. But what you see in a browser window is created from a series of instructions: 
the HTML code. So ultimately the HTML is the single entity behind what you see onscreen; the 
equivalent of the printed page.
However, there’s an important difference between an HTML page and a printed page. The HTML 
that’s fed to your browser may be a single entity when it arrives at the browser, but it may or may 
not be a single entity sitting on the server waiting for browsers to retrieve it, like a magazine on 
a newsstand waiting to be purchased. The HTML may be made up of chunks of code that get 
assembled into a whole in that split second when the browser pulls it off the shelf.
That’s the difference between dynamic and static web pages. Static pages are complete sets of 
HTML waiting to be retrieved, whereas dynamic pages are chunks of HTML that are assembled 
at the moment of retrieval into a single entity that’s displayed in your browser (some systems store 
the most recent static version of a dynamically created page to keep the server from being over-
worked, but ultimately the browser pages were created dynamically).
What I want you to take away from this lesson in particular, but the book in general, is to reject static 
thinking in favor of dynamic. You might have a vision right now for the content of a particular page 

4
Part I: Before You Start
on your website, but if you learn to view the content in chunks, there may be ways to use part of that con-
tent on another page as well. Dynamic thinking means you want to keep that chunk of content separate and 
reusable, not welded to the other content.
Content Management Systems
Creating HTML pages dynamically is one half of what a content management system (CMS) does: it takes 
chunks of code (your content) and pieces them together into a single HTML page. The other function of a 
CMS is to provide an easy way for you, the user, to manage all those chunks of content. 
Managing content does not just mean allowing you to enter text or upload images; it also means mak-
ing it easy for you to determine the relationships between chunks of content. Selecting a category for 
the article you’re working on, for example, tells the CMS to assemble that chunk in a particular way 
when someone on the Internet requests a page on your website.
Everybody understands the role of a CMS when it comes to managing content: it saves having to know 
HTML coding. But why not just have the CMS manage the content of individual HTML pages? All this 
assembling business seems like a lot of extra work. If you had a ﬁ ve-page website that never changed, 
that might be true. But suppose, even on a ﬁ ve-page website, that you decided you didn’t like the top 
section or header that appears on all the pages of your site. Although a CMS for static pages would make 
it easy to change, you’d still need to change the graphics on all ﬁ ve pages separately, because they’re all 
individual, physical pieces of coding. Now imagine that task on a site with ﬁ ve hundred pages or ﬁ ve 
thousand! Even with search-and-replace capabilities you would need to upload all ﬁ ve thousand pages 
back onto the server to replace the old version, then do it all again for the next change. Ouch!
By separating the content of individual HTML pages into chunks, a CMS offers tremendous ﬂ exibility. 
Say you wanted three thousand of your pages to have a different kind of header than the other two 
thousand. Easy, with a CMS. What if your business partner decides that your line of ﬁ ve hundred dif-
ferent wuzzbuzzes should be categorized under buzz instead of wuzz? Easy, with a CMS.
We’re always being told to embrace change, and one of the advantages of a website over print is that it 
allows you to change things as much as you want, as often as you want. The advantage of using a CMS 
instead of manually creating manual or dynamic web pages is that the managing of change is much 
easier and more ﬂ exible, which is exactly what WordPress does. 
WordPress as a CMS
Even if you get the bit about dynamic thinking and managing chunks of content, you might still be 
asking yourself: isn’t WordPress blogging software? Yes, and blogging software is nothing more than a 
CMS that’s geared toward a type of website structure––the blog. Real estate CMSs, for example, are set 
up to manage the kind of structure and content that you typically see on a real estate site. Online stores 
are managed by CMSs that organize content into catalogues or what we call shopping carts.
But I don’t want a blog, you say, so why would I use WordPress for my website? Fair question. Part 
of the answer is that you could use any CMS to build any website; it’s a matter of how much work it 

5
Lesson 1: Thinking Like WordPress
would take to do it, how much customization, how much training to use the interface in a way it was 
not intended, and so on. The rest of the answer is that WordPress’s design — the simplicity and the ﬂ ex-
ibility — make it an ideal CMS for a huge variety of uses. Yes, there will need to be creative thinking, 
sometimes add-on software, sometimes customization of the coding, but if that weren’t needed, we’d be 
talking about a custom CMS for every website.
The point is that all websites have a lot of common elements that may have different names and dif-
ferent functions, but from the standpoint of HTML coding they operate in basically the same way. For 
instance, I need a page full of testimonials whereas you need a page of all your current specials. If a tes-
timonial and a special are the chunks of content, all we need the CMS to do is assemble our chunks into 
whole pages. Your header and footer may be very different in look and content from mine, but we both 
need a header and a footer. A good CMS could care less which is which––it just assembles and man-
ages, easily and efﬁ ciently. Like WordPress does.
How WordPress Assembles Pages
Three basic structures in WordPress interact to create HTML pages: the engine, the theme, and the data-
base (where content is stored). What I call the engine is the set of ﬁ les that perform the tasks of storing, 
retrieving, and assembling content. The database is where the content is stored and the theme is made 
up of template ﬁ les that provide instructions to the engine about what to retrieve and how to assemble 
it, as I’ve tried to illustrate in Figure 1-1.

Figure 1-1
The web address you type into a browser window goes to the WordPress engine and tells it which template 
ﬁ le to look for in the theme. The engine then reads the template ﬁ le and follows the instructions about what 
chunks of content to retrieve. Depending on the complexity of the template, there may be dozens of chunks 
to be located in the database where they’re stored (technically, not all chunks are physically stored in the 
database, but at least the information on how to ﬁ nd them is stored there). Having found the content, the 
engine then assembles the chunks according to the template’s instructions and you see the result as the 
HTML page in your browser. And of course all of this has happened in a split second (or two).

6
Part I: Before You Start
Why Separate Is Good
You saw earlier why it’s important that a CMS keep form (design and structure) and content (text and 
media ﬁ les) separate, and now you’re seeing the particular power of the way WordPress achieves this. 
Remember that earlier example of wanting three thousand pages to have one header and two thousand 
pages a different header? Depending on exactly how WordPress generates those pages, you might have 
to add only one template ﬁ le to your theme to accomplish the change. 
If you want to see a dramatic example of how the separation of form and content works on the Web, visit 
a site called CSS Zen Garden (www.csszengarden.com). You can instantly switch between dozens of 
incredibly different looks, all presenting exactly the same content. 
But separating form and content isn’t the only useful kind of separation that WordPress employs. It 
also separates the form from what I’ve called the WordPress engine — the set of ﬁ les that do the actual 
assembling and managing. That engine is completely separate from the theme and the content, which is 
a good thing from a number of standpoints, the most important of which is the ability to easily update 
the engine.
Software of any kind is constantly being given new features, strengthened for security, made more efﬁ -
cient, and so on. If you had to completely redo your theme every time the engine needed an update, it 
would be very inefﬁ cient, just as having to redo your website content because of a new structure or look 
would be inefﬁ cient. As I said earlier, WordPress at its heart is a set of three separate structures — the 
engine, the theme, and the content (in a database) — each of which can be tweaked, updated, or com-
pletely replaced, all independently.
There’s a fourth separate structure to WordPress that is entirely optional: plugins. These are bits of extra 
code that you literally plug into the WordPress system and they provide additional functionality, from 
letting people rate the content on your site to automatically creating tweets on Twitter.
Sometimes people ask why they don’t just incorporate the plugins into the engine, but that would be 
defeating the whole purpose of this elegant and ﬂ exible system. To begin with, plugins are meant 
to address speciﬁ c needs. Why clutter the engine with features that not everyone uses? Sometimes a 
plugin is so useful to everyone that it is eventually incorporated into the engine, but most plugins 
aren’t like that. Also, the more complex the engine, the better the chance things will break down. 
Keep the engine simple and add on extras as you need them. I have some WordPress sites with only 
two plugins, and others have dozens. 
Another reason for keeping extra features as plugins is that there can be many variations of a plugin, 
each one serving the needs of a group of users. A good example would be plugins for photos — some 
are very simple, some are very complex, some work better than others. Having a choice of those 
plugins, rather than being stuck with only one, is another important advantage. 
How WordPress Manages Content
Very easily, thank you. Like any CMS, WordPress stores the chunks of content it uses to assemble HTML 
pages in a database. Getting that content into the database, letting you edit that content, and then storing 
instructions about how that content relates to other content is really what managing the content means. 
All databases work pretty much the same way, and though part of WordPress’s simplicity and ﬂ exibility 
stems from the way its creators built the database and the ﬁ les to run it, what ultimately matters to users 

7
Lesson 1: Thinking Like WordPress
is the interface that’s used to do the managing. It’s this administrative interface (a sample screen is shown 
in Figure 1-2) that my clients and hundreds of thousands of users around the world ﬁ nd so easy to use — 
for them, it is WordPress. 
Figure 1-2
Every CMS has its particular way of dealing with content and though WordPress is extremely easy to 
use, you still need to understand how it refers to content and the methods it uses to organize content. 
Take posts for example. In the world of blogging, people refer to the act of creating a new blog entry as 
posting. So it’s not surprising that the primary kind of content chunk in WordPress is called a post, but 
that doesn’t mean we have to use WordPress posts exclusively for a blog. A post is just a block of text 
and some instructions stored in a database. They could just as well have called them chunks. We don’t 
want to get tied to how we use posts simply because they were originally intended for and named after 
an element within blogs.
WordPress has another type of content chunk called a page, but not the HTML pages you see in your 
browser. Like posts, WordPress pages are essentially blocks of text and accompanying instructions stored 
in a database. They’re different from posts, though, in several ways. For a start, you can put only one 
WordPress page at a time into the ﬁ nal assembled HTML page. On the other hand, you can have dozens 
or even hundreds of posts displayed on a single assembled HTML page. 
Suppose you set up WordPress so that each press release for your company is entered as an individual 
post. Then, you tell WordPress to show the ﬁ ve most recent press release posts. Whenever you add a new 
press release, it goes to the top of the list. On the other hand, the content describing your company’s mis-
sion statement doesn’t change that often — it’s static in comparison to press releases — so you set up a 
WordPress page for that content. That’s how you’ll hear people describe the difference between posts 
and pages: one is for dynamic content and the other is for static content. The main thing is not to confuse a 
WordPress page with the ﬁ nal HTML page that gets generated and viewed by the public. WordPress pages and 
posts are both chunks of content that just get utilized in different ways. 

8
Part I: Before You Start
There’s another important difference between posts and pages: posts can be categorized whereas pages 
cannot. Pages can be a sub-page of another page, but it’s a very limited relationship. There’s a lot you 
can do with categories as you see later, but I’ll mention one here: a post can be placed in multiple cate-
gories at the same time. That has enormous consequences for how you use posts. It makes it very simple 
for the content of a post to appear in several or even dozens of places on a website.
For instance, if I don’t go to the press release area of your site I won’t see your announcement of a new 
wuzzbuzz for kids. But if the post for that press release also appears in the products section of the 
website, as well as in a section on helpful tips for keeping kids busy, it’s more likely I’ll notice this new 
product. Yet, you only had to enter that press release once and assign it to several categories. WordPress 
then automatically displays it in multiple locations, saving you the time of entering the same informa-
tion two or more times, let alone having to remember all the places on the website where that informa-
tion is needed.
Okay, having just told you how posts and pages differ in WordPress, I’ll be using the term posts 
throughout this book to mean both posts and pages. Partly it’s to avoid potential confusion over the 
term page, but mainly it’s for the sake of simplicity. The way you enter and edit content for posts 
and pages is virtually identical, because they both share the majority of content management features. 
Where necessary I’ll distinguish between them but unless I do, you can assume that when I say posts I 
mean both posts and pages. 
Now that you’re thinking like WordPress, it’s time to take an actual website plan and see how it can be 
organized using WordPress, which is what I’ll do in the next lesson.
Try It
There isn’t anything speciﬁ c to try based on the material in this lesson, but one thing you could do is 
examine your favorite news website and count how many different chunks of content are on one page. 
Then go to another page on the site and think about what’s common with the previous page and try to 
imagine how the builders have divided up the structure of the page — map it out on paper.
There is no video to accompany this lesson.

Planning Your Site 
for WordPress
It’s beyond the scope of this book to go into the entire planning process for a website; rather, the 
goal is to take a plan for a website and make it work using WordPress. If you’re setting up a blog 
and nothing more, WordPress has done much of the structuring for you and you can skip to the 
next chapter. For everyone else, this is a very important step because with the right kind of plan-
ning up front, you’ll not only save yourself lots of time and energy down the road, but it will help 
you think about ways to make your website even more useful and easier to navigate. To build a 
site in WordPress you have three key things to consider: 
How are various kinds of content going to be entered in WordPress?
 
❑
What categories are needed to organize that content?
 
❑
What do the layout and design roughly look like?
 
❑
The sample site you’ll be working on is for a company called Island Travel, a small travel agency 
with two locations that specializes in vacations to the Caribbean. Its primary goal is to have a web-
site that provides a very personal touch, with information largely written by its staff, and of course 
the company wants it to be as easy as possible to update and expand.
What I’ve learned over the years from my clients is that “easy” doesn’t just mean having a 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text editor. It also means being able to clearly under-
stand how what they see on the administrative side ﬁ ts with what’s seen on the site — how the 
various parts of the site ﬁ t together. 
How Content Will Be Entered
I’ve talked about how WordPress assembles chunks of content into HTML pages, and one of the 
most important tasks of the planning process is to develop a useful and straightforward organi-
zation for those chunks. Another important task is to decide how to break down the content into 
the smallest logical chunks. It’s easy to assemble those chunks in different ways later on (perhaps

in ways you can’t even envision at the moment); it’s costly to break apart chunks later when you ﬁ gure 
out that they’re too large. As a simple example, it’s better to have each testimonial as a separate chunk 
than to have one single chunk of all testimonials. With that in mind, look at a basic site map for Island 
Travel shown in Figure 2-1.

Figure 2-1
You can see the sub-pages for each of the vacation companies Island Travel deals with and sub-pages 
for the various destinations for which they book vacations. Then the rest of the site is a series of indi-
vidual HTML pages, all linked, of course, through a common menu, and there would be various links 
between them within the content of the pages.
Now, keep in mind that this is a plan for how the site will be organized when you view it, but as you 
saw in the previous lesson, that’s not the same as how it might be organized in a content manage-
ment system like WordPress. Of course, you could build the exact structure shown in the plan using 
WordPress pages and sub-pages. But remember that example about testimonials? If you just create a 
single WordPress page and keep adding testimonials to it, you can’t do anything more with the indi-
vidual testimonials. You can’t reuse them in any way. But if you enter each one as a post in WordPress, 
the sky’s the limit.
For example, you could create a category called Testimonials, and then a series of subcategories corre-
sponding to each of your vacation destinations. When a new testimonial is added, it would be assigned 
to the subcategory for the destination the testimonial is about. Now if you want to show all testimonials 
at one time, it doesn’t matter how many subcategories there are; they’re all under the parent category, 
so you could show all testimonials as a group. At the same time, on the Jamaica destination page, for 
example, you could have a link saying Read Testimonials About Jamaican Vacations and it would con-
nect to all the testimonials in the Jamaica Testimonials subcategory. 
Suppose the testimonial concerns Jamaica and The Dominican Republic. Simply categorize it under both 
destinations and the same testimonial will show up in three places automatically — the Testimonials 
page, the Jamaica page, and the Dominican Republic page. That’s the power of keeping your content in 
the smallest chunks possible.
It’s really the same thinking that led to the original site map showing suppliers and destinations as sub-
pages. You could put all the suppliers on a single page, but not only might that make for a very large page 
(not very friendly for visitors), it just wouldn’t be as ﬂ exible, such as having a link to a speciﬁ c supplier. 
So, suppliers were broken down into their smallest possible chunks — same with the vacation destina-
tions. You’re applying that principle even further when you’re thinking about how to use WordPress.

11
Lesson 2: Planning Your Site for WordPress
Another way to think of this process is to look at content and ask whether it can be used in multiple 
ways across the site. If it can be or even if you think it might be in the future, it’s better to enter the con-
tent as a post now. 
Coming at it from yet another direction, enter your base products or services as WordPress pages and 
supporting information as posts. That’s not a hard and fast rule by any means, but it’s a starting point. 
For example, Island Travel has vacation suppliers, each of which has many products, has ever-changing 
company news, has customers giving testimonials about them, and so on. The supplier’s basic information 
(logo and so on) does not belong anywhere else, whereas its products could be listed in several places on 
the site, as could its company news, testimonials, and so on. So keep the supplier as a WordPress page, the 
rest of the information as individual posts, and then just link those posts to the page through categories. 
Going back to the site map, then, here’s a list of how you’re going to enter various types of content into 
WordPress:
Suppliers — individual sub-pages
Destinations — individual sub-pages
Specials — individual posts
Staff Picks — individual posts
Travel News — individual posts
Testimonials — individual posts
Staff — single page
About — single page
Contact — single page
Customer Deals — password-protected single page
You could of course deal with the content in other ways, but I think this is a logical approach and leaves 
a lot of room to get even more creative later on.
How Categories Will Be Organized
Now it’s time to give some thought to the category structure for posts and how that structure will relate to 
your primary types of content chunks: suppliers and destinations. Consider two approaches you could take:
Two Approaches to Categorizing
Subject-based
Type-based
Jamaica
Testimonials
Jamaica Specials
Jamaica Testimonials
Jamaica Testimonials
Sun Worship Testimonials
Jamaica Travel News
Cancun Testimonials
Continued

12
Part I: Before You Start
Subject-based
Type-based
Sun Worship Holidays
Travel News
Sun Worship Specials
Jamaica Travel News
Sun Worship Testimonials
Sun Worship Travel News
Sun Worship Travel News
Cancun Travel News
At ﬁ rst glance, it might look as if the Subject approach is nicely geared to your primary content chunks. 
The parent categories — Jamaica and Sun Worship Holidays are the examples shown — correspond to 
sub-pages on the site. The problem is, other than linking the Sun Worship Holidays category to the Sun 
Worship Holidays page, how would you easily use the posts in that category?
Let’s go back to the example of testimonials for a moment. If you choose the Subject approach, it wouldn’t 
be easy to have a single testimonials page displaying all testimonials at one time. You’d need to ﬁ gure out 
some way to gather together the various testimonials categories rather than letting WordPress’s parent-
child category structure do the work for you. Same problem if you want to have a random testimonial 
from the list of all testimonials appear on the site’s sidebar; unless they’re all under one parent category, 
there’d be some customization work needed.
But with the Type approach, not only can you easily have an “all testimonials” page, but you simply 
link the Sun Worship Holidays testimonials category to the Sun Worship Holidays page. Keep it simple; 
keep it ﬂ exible; that’s the motto in this planning process. So let’s go with a category structure based on 
content type and not on the destination or supplier.
How the Site Should Look
Part of the planning process for any site is to determine the layout of the pages and the way they’ll look. 
As you saw in Lesson 1, WordPress assembles and delivers HTML pages through a group of template ﬁ les 
called a theme, so all you need to do is choose a theme that will give you the look you want, or at least 
something very close to it. You can of course get a customized theme created for you, but there’s very likely 
an existing free theme that will give you something close to what you want.
The best place to look for a theme is the WordPress.org theme directory http://wordpress.org/
extend/themes/ (Starting with WordPress version 2.8 you can do this directly from the administration 
screen, which I cover in Lesson 33). Not only are the themes in this directory free, but more importantly 
they’ve been checked to make sure they function properly. Right now, however, you’re simply planning 
what you want in a theme. 
A word of warning as you browse through the themes: don’t get caught up in what I call the magpie effect 
and be dazzled by all the bright shining objects. That directory contains a lot of very nice looking designs, 
but you need to follow some guidelines. As I say, it’s highly unlikely that any theme in the WordPress 
directory is going to be exactly right for your travel site or any particular site — at the very least you’re 
going to want to add your own logo — but the better idea you have of the layout and the look, the less 
you’re going to have to do to make that theme work for you and the less likely you are to be a magpie.

Lesson 2: Planning Your Site for WordPress
Site Layout
When it comes to the overall site layout, conventional and safe is not only good, it’s essential. People have 
come to expect certain things in certain places — why mess with their minds? Besides, you want them 
to focus on your content, not on the fact that your main menu sits sideways on the right-hand side of the 
screen and does a cool slide out when you mouse over it. You want people to ﬁ nd things easily, and the 
best way to do that is to follow conventions. Let your individuality come out in the header and the con-
tent, but for the basic layout, follow the path well-worn for a small business site, as Figure 2-2 illustrates.
HEADER
FOOTER
SIDEBAR
MAIN CONTENT AREA
Figure 2-2
You start with a header area across the top, including the menu of all your pages. On the left-hand side 
you have any secondary navigation plus additional information such as random testimonials, important 
specials, and so on. Your content will ﬁ ll the rest of the page and then at the bottom you have your footer, 
including a reduced menu with just key pages listed. Simple, easy to follow, and no surprises. Now you 
know what you’re looking for in a theme’s layout.
Site Design
This is a far more individual issue than site layout, but you still need to think of your visitors, and from 
that standpoint simplicity of design is always better. It’s just easier to ﬁ nd your way around a simple 
design because it’s less cluttered and visitors are more likely to focus on the content. Of course, if the 
point of your site is to show off design skills, that’s another matter. For the Island Travel site, you’re con-
cerned about creating the right mood (fun, relaxation, sunshine, and so on) but at the same time making 
it clutter-free and easy to see content on the page. 
To capture the right mood, I think something light — no thick lines, fancy graphics, or strong areas of 
color — with light browns and sky blues could be one way to go. If you have a graphics program, even 
a basic one, it’s worth creating a simple mockup of your site design, like the one in Figure 2-3 for Island 
Travel, or simply sketch out a design on paper, making notes about colors. 

14
Part I: Before You Start
Figure 2-3
This mockup will be useful for whoever is going to do the customizing of your WordPress theme — the 
topic of Lessons 27–29. I’m leaving the look of the site until later in the book because getting content entered 
and organized is the most important task and as that process unfolds, new ideas for the design may come 
to mind. But at least for the moment, you have a good idea of where you want that design to go.
If you need design inspiration, the ofﬁ cial WordPress theme directory I mentioned earlier is a great place to 
start. If you ﬁ nd something very close to what you want, all the better because it will be simpler to modify 
and get exactly the look you want. For the purposes of this book, you’re going to work with the Default theme 
that’s automatically installed with WordPress. And speaking of installing, that’s the subject of the next lesson.
Try It
This lesson does not have a step-by-step instruction you can follow, but it would be good for you to cre-
ate the kinds of planning documents discussed in the lesson for your own site:
A site map
 
❑
A list of types of content and whether they will be pages or posts
 
❑
A category structure you think you’ll want for posts
❑
A site mockup

There is no video to accompany this lesson.

Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Lesson 3: Installing WordPress
Lesson 4: Admin Area Overview
Lesson 5: Basic Admin Settings


Installing WordPress
The WordPress website talks about its famous ﬁ ve-minute install. It’s no idle boast —  everything 
in this lesson can be done in ﬁ ve minutes, but it took me a few WordPress sites to get it down to 
that time. If it’s your ﬁ rst install, and you’re handy with an FTP program, familiar with database 
installs using a hosting panel like Parallels/Plesk or cPanel, and at ease with editing ﬁ les in a text 
editor, I would count on about 10 to 15 minutes. If you’re relying completely on this lesson to lead 
you through the steps, it could be 30 minutes or more.
What the ﬁ ve-minute install really refers to is the fact that once you have ﬁ les in place and a data-
base created, clicking the Install button has you up and running in less than ﬁ ve minutes. This 
lesson is mostly about what comes before clicking the Install button.
Because this book covers the self-hosted version of WordPress, I’m assuming that you have a host-
ing account on a web server.  This is different from having a domain name.  Domain names point 
to servers where the ﬁ les for a website are stored and having a place to put your web site ﬁ les is 
what I mean by a hosting account.
Some hosts offer auto-installation of WordPress, so check for that, but be sure 
they’re using the latest version.
There are very few requirements for WordPress, and most hosting packages these days —  even 
the most basic —  should meet them. Still it’s best to double-check the host you’re planning to use 
or your existing account for the following:
MySQL database version 4.0 or greater
 
❑
PHP version 4.3 or greater
 
❑

18
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
If you’re not sure how to word your question to your hosting company, the 
WordPress site provides you with the text for an e-mail you can send: http://
wordpress.org/about/requirements/. You’ll notice that the letter adds a third 
item to the list:  The mod_rewrite Apache module.  This module is needed for the 
custom permalinks feature in WordPress and while there is a way to use custom 
permalinks without it, it just makes life a bit easier.  Most Linux servers have the 
module installed.
Once you’ve conﬁ rmed that these requirements are met, you’re ready to begin the installation process.
Uploading the WordPress Files
The ﬁ rst thing you’re going to need is a copy of the latest version of WordPress, and you can easily get 
that from the ofﬁ cial WordPress website at http://wordpress.org where you’ll see a big orange but-
ton at the top right called Download. That takes you to a page where the latest release is always avail-
able. Click Download WordPress 2.8.4 (or whatever the current version is).
If you have your browser set to ask you where you want to save downloaded ﬁ les, ﬁ nd your My 
Downloads (Windows) or Downloads (Mac) folder and create a new folder called WordPress, then 
save the .zip ﬁ le there. 
If your browser just starts downloading the ﬁ le you may need to do some hunting around to locate 
it (hopefully it’s just on your Desktop).  Create a folder called WordPress in your My Downloads or 
Downloads folder and drop the .zip ﬁ le there.
All the WordPress ﬁ les are zipped up or packed into a single ﬁ le, so you’ll need to “unpack” it. If you 
right-click the .zip ﬁ le you should see an option in the popup window to open the ﬁ le. If you don’t, 
it means your computer does not have a program capable of unzipping the ﬁ le; for Windows try 7-Zip 
at http://www.7-zip.org; for Mac try Stufﬁ t Expander at http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/
stuffit/expander.html.
The unpacking process will leave you with a new folder containing all of the WordPress ﬁ les, which 
now need to be uploaded to your server. For that, you’ll need an FTP program and the following 
information: hostname, user/login name, and password. You would have received a username and 
password from your hosting company or the person who set up the account for you. The hostname is 
usually just ftp.yourdomain.com, but you’ll need to check that’s the case. If you don’t have an FTP 
program, lots of choices are available for Windows and Mac. An excellent free FTP program for both 
platforms is FileZilla at http://filezilla-project.org or you can go to www.downloads.com and 
search for FTP.
In your FTP program you create a new connection and enter the hostname, user/login, and password. 
When you click the Connect button, the program logs in to your server. Virtually every FTP program 
operates by showing you a screen like Figure 3-1, which is split between your computer on the left and 
the server on the right. 

19
Chapter 3: Installing WordPress
You can see the WordPress ﬁ les you downloaded over on the left. They all have wp- at the begin-
ning, which is very useful because it makes it extremely unlikely that they’ll have the same name as 
existing ﬁ les on your server, so there’s no chance of overwriting something you shouldn’t (except for 
index.php).
Figure 3-1
The decision you need to make now is exactly where you want to put WordPress on your server. If 
WordPress is going to run your entire website, the decision is simple —  it goes in the root folder of 
whatever is the web directory on your server. This directory will have different names depending on 
your server —  like public_html or httpdocs or www —  you’ll need to check that out with your host-
ing company.  In Figure 3-1, the web directory is public_html, so you would open that and put your 
WordPress ﬁ les in there.
If you have an existing website and you’re going to be using WordPress as an add-on, you could still 
put it in the root directory; as I mentioned, the naming convention likely wouldn’t overwrite any of 
your existing ﬁ les, but you should always double-check of course, especially with index.php, which 
may already be the homepage of your site. Or if you have a particularly crowded root directory you 
might want to create a folder called “wp” and put the ﬁ les in there, just to make it easy to ﬁ nd things.
Once you’ve decided where to put WordPress and you’re in that directory on the right side of the FTP 
screen, you simply highlight all the ﬁ les on the left side and click the  button that goes the direction you 
want.  Typically FTP programs use arrow buttons, and as you cans see in Figure 3-1 it’s an up arrow 
button (top left of the screen), indicating that you’re uploading to the server.  Other programs use left 
and right arrows to indicate you’re transferring from one side to the other.

20
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
In a short time you’ll see all of the ﬁ les on the left copied over to the right. You’re one third of the way 
to completing your installation. Now you’ll just need to set up a database and conﬁ gure one ﬁ le before 
you’re ready for the Install button.
Setting Up Your Database
One of the requirements I mentioned for WordPress was that your hosting package include a MySQL 
database. That’s where WordPress is going to store not only what you write, but all the details about 
your categories, preferences, passwords, and so on. However, having a database included with your 
hosting still means you need to set it up, and for that many hosting companies offer an interface, usu-
ally as part of a hosting control panel such as Parallels/Plesk or cPanel. Other hosts may require you 
to submit a request for creation of a database and they’ll do it for you.
I can’t cover all the possible ways of setting up the database, but you need to do three things:
 1. 
Create/name the database.
 2. 
Create a user —  a username and password.
 3. 
Assign that user to the database.
When assigning the user to the database, make sure she has “all privileges,” which means the user can 
read and write to the database, alter its structure, and so on. If someone else is setting up the database 
for you, make sure to let them know this.
Make sure the user’s password is a strong one —  no names of pets or numbers 
based on birthdays. Have at least nine characters with a mix of upper- and lower-
case letters and numbers in it.
For the installation of WordPress you’ll need the following information (keep track of it as you set 
up the database or make sure you get it from whoever does the install):
 1. 
The full name of the database.
 2. 
The username.
 3. 
The user password.
 4. 
The host or server name for the database (usually it’s ”localhost”).
Most of you will be hosted on what’s called a shared environment, which simply 
means a whole lot of websites on a single server. Typically in a shared environment, 
the name you enter for the database is combined in some way with your username 
to make sure the database’s name is unique. 
So if you call your database “mydb” the actual name could be “mydb-myhostlog-
inname.” At the end of the database creation process, hosting panels like Parallels/
Plesk and cPanel will display these complete names, so be sure to write them down 
and not just the name you entered when you created the database.

21
Chapter 3: Installing WordPress
Doing the Installation
With all the WordPress ﬁ les uploaded to your site, your database set up, and your database details by 
your side, it’s time to do the installation.
In your browser window, enter the address www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php (if you 
uploaded the ﬁ les to a subdirectory, you’ll need that in there as well) and hit Enter.
The resulting screen tells you that WordPress can’t ﬁ nd the conﬁ guration ﬁ le, but that’s ok because 
there isn’t one included in the ﬁ les you downloaded from WordPress.org  —   it has to be created.  You 
have two options at this point: 
 1. 
Continue and let WordPress try to create the ﬁ le for you.
 2. 
Manually edit the sample conﬁ guration ﬁ le included with the WordPress ﬁ les you downloaded.
 Option 1 is the simplest way to go, so I’ll be demonstrating the automated creation of the conﬁ guration 
ﬁ le. Sometimes, a server won’t allow WordPress to create the ﬁ le and you’ll need to use Option 2.  I 
cover the manual creation of the conﬁ guration in this lesson’s video. 
After clicking Create a Conﬁ guration File you’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 3-2 outlining the 
information that you’ll need to proceed (the four items I told you to write down when you created your 
database).  
Figure 3-2
The screen in Figure 3-2 also explains about manually creating the conﬁ guration ﬁ le if the automated 
process doesn’t work.  When you click Let’s Go, you’re taken to the screen shown in Figure 3-3.

22
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Figure 3-3
This is where you’ll enter the information about your database. As the screen says, it’s extremely rare 
that you’ll need to change the value for Database Host. And as for Table Preﬁ x, leave it as you see it.
Once you have all the information copied into the correct box, you can click Submit. The next screen 
tells you that WordPress and your database are on speaking terms and that it’s time to install, so click 
Run the Install.
This is where the famous ﬁ ve-minute install really begins, and the ﬁ rst thing WordPress wants is a bit 
more information, as shown in Figure 3-4.
You can change this information later if you need to, but go ahead and enter the title of the website 
and your e-mail address (that’s where a copy of your password will be sent). I recommend leaving the 
checkbox at the bottom (the one about search engines) unchecked for the moment —  you don’t want 
search engines looking at your site until it’s ready. If you think you might forget to turn this on later, 
however, it’s best to check it now. Then you’re ready to click Install WordPress.
In the blink of an eye, the install is done and you’re presented with your username —  no offense, they 
call everybody “admin” —  and a diabolical password. I realize it’s virtually unmemorizable, but that’s a 
good thing. Copy and paste it somewhere safe, like in a password manager. You’re then presented with 
the option of going to the WordPress login screen, which is exactly what you’ll need to do for the next 
lesson.

Try It
There’s nothing additional to try in this lesson —  hopefully you completed the installation using these 
instructions. If you don’t plan on doing the installation right now, you could always set up an FTP pro-
gram if you don’t have one or download WordPress for use later.
You can see more details, such as creating a conﬁ guration ﬁ le by hand, under 
Lesson 3 on the enclosed DVD.


Admin Area Overview
One of WordPress’s greatest strengths is the user-friendliness of its administration interface. Both 
from an organizational and a design standpoint it’s laid out in a way that’s pretty intuitive. Like 
any system, of course, you need to take some time and learn how it works, where things are, and 
so on, and that’s what this lesson is about: helping you familiarize yourself with the WordPress 
administration area.
Logging In
The moment you install WordPress, your website is up and running with a home page and an 
about page — you’ll see the home page by entering your domain name in your browser. Now you 
need to set up the structure of the site and enter content, which is done through the administra-
tion interface, and to get there, you have to log in. On the default theme, there’s a Log In link over 
on the lower right hand side.
Most WordPress themes include a login link, usually on the sidebar or in the footer, but 
if not, you can get to the login screen using the address www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin. 
If you installed WordPress in a subdirectory you would need to add that before 
/wp-admin, of course.
Clicking the Log In link takes you to the login screen shown in Figure 4-1, which asks for your 
username and password. 

26
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Figure 4-1
If you ever lose your password, WordPress can reset it for you, but that only works if the e-mail address 
in your proﬁ le is up to date (I show you how to do that in Lesson 5). 
The ﬁ rst time you log in to WordPress 2.8 you’ll see a warning message in red, asking whether you want 
to keep the diabolical password automatically generated for you or change it to something more memo-
rable. Say No to changing that password. “Memorable” makes it sound like the name of your dog is 
okay as a password.
If you absolutely want something memorable, at the very least make it a bit diabolical and certainly 
long. For example, the street address of your ﬁ rst home + your dog’s name backwards with a mix of 
lower- and uppercase + your aunt’s birth month and day + the ﬁ rst four letters of your favorite movie. 
And remember to replace the original password from your installation, wherever you kept it safe.
The warning message at the top of the administration area will disappear once you answer yes or no.
When you log in a cookie is created in your browser that tells WordPress you’re logged 
in. If you close your browser or the tab where you were working on the admin screen, 
and then come back in a few hours, you’ll ﬁ nd that you’re still logged in. More com-
monly, people return to their WordPress site and notice Edit links everywhere and 
think that the world can get into their site and access the admin screen. What’s hap-
pened is that you never logged out and the cookie is still active — that’s why it’s impor-
tant to log out, especially if you’re working on a public terminal or your roommate or 
your children get a hold of your computer!

27
Lesson 4: Admin Area Overview
The Dashboard
When you log in to WordPress, the ﬁ rst screen you get is called the Dashboard, which is the home page 
for the administration area. The top half of the Island Travel dashboard is shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2
There’s a lot going on in the Dashboard, so I’ll only cover the main functions here.
Item A is the Right Now box, where you’ll ﬁ nd a quick overview of your WordPress installation: how 
many posts, pages, drafts, and comments you have, with links directly to each of those areas of the admin 
section. You’ll also see what version of WordPress you’re running, and if you don’t have the latest version 
an Update button automatically appears (or if you’re not an administrator, a warning to contact your 
administrator).
Item B is QuickPress, which can be a handy little tool for quickly posting new items to your website. 
However, an important limitation of QuickPress is that you cannot choose the category to which the 
post is assigned — it automatically goes into your default category. 
Item C is Recent Comments and it displays a couple of lines and the author from the ﬁ ve most recent 
comments on your site. The View All button takes you to the Comments screen of the admin area.
Item D is Incoming Links. It shows you what blogs are linking to your site. The default feed comes from 
Google Blog Search, but you can customize this and I show you how in Lesson 32.
The rest of the Dashboard contains the latest news about WordPress, the latest plugins available, and 
your recent drafts.

28
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
I must admit, I don’t make a lot of use of the Dashboard in day-to-day maintenance of sites, except in 
the case of blogs, where knowing at a glance where comments stand and what incoming links there are 
can be very useful. Still, it’s good to be able to have your ﬁ nger on the pulse of your website and the 
WordPress community whenever you log in.
Customizing Admin Screens
You can customize the boxes on WordPress admin screens in three ways: 
Minimize a box
 
❑
Show or hide a box on the page
 
❑
Move boxes around the screen
 
❑
To minimize a box, just click anywhere on its header area. To restore it, just do the same.
Showing or hiding boxes is managed from the Screen Options button at the very top right of the screen, 
shown in detail in Figure 4-3. Dropping down this menu allows you to pick and choose from the boxes 
available for that screen.
Figure 4-3
Checking a box makes the element appear and unchecking it makes it disappear. What’s nice is that 
this happens in real time so you can see what the change looks like before closing Screen Options. 

29
Lesson 4: Admin Area Overview
In addition to deciding what’s shown, as of WordPress 2.8, you can choose how many columns wide the 
screen will be. The default is two, but for the increasingly wider screens of today’s monitors it can be 
helpful to expand that up to four columns wide.
The third way to customize the display of boxes is to physically move them around the page. For exam-
ple, if I don’t use the QuickPress feature so much, but I do read the development blog info, I can switch 
places by moving them around.
All you do is place your mouse over the dark gray header bar of the box and you’ll see it change to the 
hand cursor. At that point you can click and drag. As the box moves it disappears from its original loca-
tion, and a blank box inserts itself between existing boxes wherever you point the mouse, as shown in 
Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4
When you see that blank box in the spot you want, you just release the mouse button and the screen has 
been rearranged.
With larger boxes, it can be easier to collapse them ﬁ rst and then move them around.
Getting Around the Admin Area
Your primary way of navigating the admin area is with the menu over on the left-hand side of the 
screen. The default setting for the menu, with all submenus collapsed, is shown in Figure 4-5A. When 
you click one of the main links, you’re taken to that admin section and the submenu items are shown, 
as in Figure 4-5B.

Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Figure 4-5
You can force a submenu to stay open all the time by mousing over the right edge of a menu header and 
clicking the little down arrow shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6
The menu stays expanded until you close it again, which is very helpful for those submenus you access 
all the time, like Posts and Pages.
The entire side menu can be collapsed to icons-only mode and that can help save space. You just need 
to click one of the two lines circled in Figure 4-7A. Once the menu has collapsed, to view the submenus 
simply mouseover an icon as shown in Figure 4-7B.
Figure 4-7
The other way of navigating around the admin area is with the drop-down menu at the top right of the 
dark header bar, as shown in Figure 4-8.

31
Lesson 4: Admin Area Overview
Figure 4-8
This menu contains ﬁ ve items: New Post, Drafts, New Page, New Media, and Comments. You can access 
them all at any time by mousing over the button, but what’s displayed on the button is contextual, based 
on whatever admin page you’re currently viewing.
Try It
In this lesson you try reorganizing your Dashboard and collapsing your side menu.
Lesson Requirements
WordPress installed.
Step-by-Step
To reorganize the Dashboard, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the header of the QuickPress box and drag it downward.
 2. 
When you get below Other WordPress News, stop and let go.
 3. 
Go back up and double-click the header of the WordPress Development Blog box (which should be 
at the top of your right-hand column). The WordPress Development Blog should now be collapsed.
 4. 
Do the same for Other WordPress News. You should now be able to see QuickPress without 
having to scroll.
 5. 
Go to Screen Options and click it.
 6. 
Uncheck Recent Comments and you should see it disappear.
 7. 
Close Screen Options by clicking the button again.
 8. 
Return the Dashboard to the way you want it.

32
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
To collapse the side menu, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move your cursor over the light gray line below Dashboard on the side menu.
 2. 
Click when the cursor changes to a double-ended arrow (Internet Explorer — Windows) or a 
left arrow and upright line (Firefox — Windows and Mac).
 3. 
You should now see only icons and no titles.
 4. 
Mouseover an icon to view the submenu.
 5. 
Restore the full menu if you prefer, using the same method.

Basic Admin Settings
WordPress has dozens of administrative settings at your disposal, but you’ll probably use most 
of the default settings for as long as you run your site. So the good news is you don’t need to mess 
with more than a few settings as you begin to build your site.
This lesson is to familiarize you with the Settings menu and to show you how to change those 
truly important few settings. I deal with other admin settings as they’re needed in other lessons. 
Settings to Get You Started
The Settings heading on the admin menu is where you control various site-wide parameters for 
WordPress, and its submenus are divided by functions:
General 
 
❑
Writing
 
❑
Reading
 
❑
Discussion
 
❑
Media
 
❑
Privacy
 
❑
Permalinks
 
❑
Miscellaneous
 
❑
This is the menu when you ﬁ rst install WordPress. If you add plugins (those extra pieces of soft-
ware that enable WordPress to do even more) this Settings menu may show more choices depend-
ing on the plugins.
The ﬁ rst of the crucial settings to be changed are under Settings ➪ General, where you’ll get the 
screen shown in Figure 5-1.

34
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Figure 5-1
Tagline
The tagline is the text just below the title of your site displayed in the header. This is meant to be a more 
descriptive phrase about your site and in the case of the Island Travel sample site, Figure 5-2 shows the 
new tagline as it appears on the site after saving the changes.
Figure 5-2

35
Lesson 5: Basic Admin Settings
By default, the tagline says “just another WordPress blog” and you’ll sometimes 
see this on people’s sites — they neglected to check their General settings!
WordPress Address (URL)
This is the web address of the directory where you actually installed WordPress. Usually this is already 
ﬁ lled in, but you should check, even if it is. If you installed WordPress in the root directory on your 
server, the URL is simply www.yourdomain.com. If you put WordPress in a separate folder, it would be 
www.yourdomain/foldername.
Blog Address (URL)
This really means your website address (WordPress assumes you’re just creating a blog), so it would be 
www.yourdomain.com, and again, it’s usually already ﬁ lled in, so you’re just making sure it’s right. 
Don’t be concerned if this is the same as the WordPress address; they’re used for different purposes, and 
often are one and the same. The real value of having the two addresses becomes clear when WordPress is 
installed in a folder or subdirectory. 
E-mail Address
Double-check that this is the address you entered when you installed WordPress. Or you can change it, 
but whatever e-mail you use, remember this is the one where notiﬁ cations are sent having to do with 
administrative tasks, such as new users being created.
Timezone
For correctly setting the date and time your content is published or scheduled to be published, you’ll 
want to change the Timezone. WordPress makes this easy by providing a drop-down menu of major 
cities around the world. Just ﬁ nd a city in your time zone, click Save Changes, and the correct date and 
time should show up in the Timezone setting area.
Save these new settings before leaving the page; just click Save Changes at the bottom of the page.
And that’s it for administrative settings at this point. We’ll come back to adjust other settings as needed, 
but except for completing your personal proﬁ le, there’s nothing stopping you from publishing content 
to your site.
Setting Your Personal Profile
When you install WordPress, the system knows you as “admin” but you’re more than just an admin, 
you’re a human being with a name, contact information, and color scheme preferences. That’s where 
your proﬁ le comes in.

36
Part II: Firing Up WordPress
Under the User menu you’ll ﬁ nd a link to Your Proﬁ le, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3
This is where you can give yourself a proper name, and most importantly, decide how you want that 
name to appear on posts and other places on the website. You can enter a First Name, Last Name, and 
a Nickname. By default, the Nickname is the same as the username, but you can change that (you can’t 
change the username).
Once you’ve entered whatever names you want they’re available under the drop-down menu Display 
Name Publicly As. If your posts display an author name, this is where you choose what name will be 
displayed.
There is also a setting that allows users to disable the Visual Editor when writing content (the editor is 
covered in Lesson 7) and most people will want to leave this box unchecked. The Visual Editor allows 
you to write in WYSIWYG mode.
Two color schemes are available by default for the admin section: gray and blue. The gray one is selected 
by default, but users can choose for themselves. Plugins are available for WordPress that allow you to 
have even more choices. Me, I’m a fan of the default gray.
Finally, it’s very important to make sure the correct e-mail address is listed in your proﬁ le. You’ll see 
that the e-mail address you entered during installation has been used as your proﬁ le e-mail, just as it 
was for the e-mail under General Settings. The two can be different, but the main thing is that your pro-
ﬁ le e-mail be, and continue to be, a functioning e-mail address or else you won’t be able to recover your 
password if you ever lose it. 

37

Lesson 10: Adding a New Page


Adding a New Post — Overview
In this lesson you learn the basics of creating a new post, tagging it and categorizing it, then pub-
lishing it to your website. Virtually everything I talk about here applies to writing pages. When 
I use the term post, then, I’m also talking about pages. I’ll point out important differences as they 
come up and then, in Lesson 10, I cover the elements unique to pages.
Anatomy of a New Post
A new post can be started from two locations on the admin screen: the Add New link on the left-
hand menu under Posts (or Add New under Pages) and from the drop-down menu at the top of 
the screen, both shown in Figure 6-1. 
Figure 6-1

42
Part III: Working with Written Content
Bloggers and others in a hurry should note that posts (but not pages) can also be added from the QuickPress 
section of the Dashboard as well as from a Press This bookmarklet, if you have it installed in your browser. 
Both of these links take you to the Add New Post screen, the top half of which is shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2
The elements on this half of the screen — which I’ve labeled for ease of reference — are the ones you’ll 
work with the most. The other half of the Add New Post screen has more options that I cover in Lesson 9. 
This is how the screen looks by default. You can move elements around by dragging a title bar or you 
can choose to remove certain elements by using the Screen Options at the top right. In all the installa-
tions of WordPress I’ve done, though, I’ve rarely moved or removed any of the elements in this top area 
of the screen because I’m always using them.
Item A is the title box (it’s not labeled title in case you think that’s missing on your installation). The 
area below the title box is blank when you ﬁ rst open the screen, but after you’ve entered a title, you’ll 
see the Permalink area, as shown in Figure 6-3.
Figure 6-3
www.allitebooks.com

43
Lesson 6: Adding a New Post — Overview
Item B is the primary work area for entering posts: the Text Editor or Post Box as it’s sometimes described. 
I’m going to use the term Text Editor partly because it’s used mostly for editing and laying out text, but 
also because it’s used for both posts and pages.
By default, the Text Editor displays in Visual mode, which means that text is displayed in a WYSIWYG 
format, like a word processor — there’s even a row of function buttons like on a word processor. You 
can see the two tabs on the right of the Text Editor header bar and they allow you to switch between 
Visual and HTML mode. It’s handy to be able to see the HTML coding, but for the most part you’ll 
likely work in Visual mode. 
Just above the header bar over on the left is Item C — a small menu called Upload/Insert. These icons 
are for working with images and other media you may want to include in a post. I cover this menu in 
Lesson 11 when I talk about media content — for the moment we’ll stick with written content.
At the top right of the Add New Post screen is Item D — the Publish box. Publishing a post means making it 
go live so the world can see it and from this box you control when and how your content is published.
Immediately below the Publish box is Item E, Post Tags, and then Item F, Categories. As the names sug-
gest, these are used to group posts in any number of ways, and I come back to them after covering the 
actual writing of a post.
Writing a Post
In this part of the overview I touch on the very basics of using the Text Editor, then in Lessons 7 and 8 
I go into more detail about all the functions.
The Button Bar
The heart of the Text Editor is the button bar, from which you access all the functions. By default, WordPress 
displays a single row of buttons in Visual mode as shown in detail in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4
Some of these will be familiar from using word processing programs. Most are used for formatting text, 
but the one at the far right that I’ve highlighted is called the Kitchen Sink button and clicking it reveals 
a second row of buttons, as shown in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5

44
Part III: Working with Written Content
If you log out from WordPress with the second row of buttons displayed, it will 
still be there when you log in again and until you toggle back at some point to a 
single row. There is no setting for defaulting to one or two rows of buttons — it’s 
determined by each user’s actions.
Before getting to a few of these functions and actually entering some text, it’s important to say some-
thing about the realities of Visual mode.
What You See Isn’t Quite What You Get
On the surface it seems like Visual mode is supposed to show your content as it’s going to look when you 
publish it, just as word processing programs show you what your page will look like when it’s printed. 
However, there are two key ways in which the WordPress Text Editor is not WYSIWYG and I think it’s 
important to get these out of the way early to avoid confusion and disappointment.
 1. 
The Text Editor is not controlled by your style sheet.
What you see on your live site is formatted by the style sheet of your WordPress theme, but it has 
no effect on what you see in the Text Editor. There will always be differences between what you 
see in the Text Editor and what visitors see on the live site, and sometimes those differences can 
be quite major. That’s why WordPress has the Preview button, so that you can see your post the 
way your style sheet is going to display it. It’s important to check Preview before your publish or 
update a post.
 2. 
The Text Editor thinks of spacing very differently than you.
You’re used to hitting your Enter or Return key on a word processor and getting extra space 
between paragraphs — the more you do, the more space you get. Not so with the Text Editor. 
Put as many spaces as you like between paragraphs, but when you click Publish or Update, 
they all disappear. There’s a method in this apparent madness, and I explain more in Lessons 
7 and 8. I also show you some ways to add that extra space if you’re desperate to do so. For the 
moment it’s enough to know that you can avoid frustration by only hitting the Enter key once 
per paragraph.
Another way of putting these warnings is to say that the role of Visual mode is not to give you exactly 
what you’re going to get, but to make basic formatting obvious and to simplify functions like creating 
links. For instance, it’s much clearer to see that this is going to be bold text on my website than to deci-
pher the actual HTML: <strong>this is going to be bold text</strong>. And for tasks like 
creating links or making lists, it’s much easier to click a button than to learn HTML coding. So Visual 
mode is still very useful despite its limits.
Working with Text
To enter text, of course, you just start typing in the Text Editor box. As you type, the box scrolls down 
as needed (the default size of the Text Editor is quite small, but you can change that in a number of 
ways — see Lesson 7). You can keep track of your word count at the lower left of the box, while on the 
right you’ll see the last time you saved the current material and the last time the post was edited.

45
Lesson 6: Adding a New Post — Overview
I’m going to create a new post with the title Seven Day Capital Package and enter text about a vacation 
package in Kingston, Jamaica. When you want to format text you simply highlight the words, press the 
appropriate button, and you’ll see the change. For example, I’ll go in and make the name Kingston bold, 
as shown in Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-6
When you want to start a new paragraph, you hit Enter on your keyboard. To cut, copy, or paste text you’ll 
need to use the standard keyboard commands — Ctl+x, Ctl+c, Ctl+v — because there are no buttons for 
these functions.
For those who like to use keyboard shortcuts, most of the old standbys work in 
the Visual mode Text Editor, including undoing and saving. You can also access 
any non-standard function on the button bar using the keyboard — to ﬁ nd out the 
keyboard commands, just mouse over the button or on the second row of buttons 
the rightmost button pops up a window with details about the Visual Text Editor, 
including all keyboard commands. 
Before leaving the Text Editor, I make sure I save my work. Because this is a new post but I don’t want 
to publish it yet, I click Save Draft at the top of the Publish box. I would keep using that button until I 
publish, and at that point, Save Draft disappears and the Publish button changes to Update Post. There 
is auto-save built into WordPress, but you never know what might interrupt you and cause unsaved 
changes to be lost, so it’s just a good habit save regularly.

46
Part III: Working with Written Content
Categories and Tags
You can organize posts (but not pages) in two ways: by categorizing and by tagging them. Each fulﬁ lls 
a special role even if they seem quite similar. One way to think of the difference is that categories are 
like a table of contents whereas tags are like an index — categories are general and tags are speciﬁ c. 
Categories
Categories are the primary way of organizing posts, so I’ll begin with them. The Categories box shown 
in Figure 6-7 displays all the existing categories for your site and allows you to add new categories 
without leaving the screen.
Figure 6-7
Right now there’s only one category called Uncategorized. Because posts must be in at least one category, 
WordPress comes with a category which cannot be deleted. So if you save or publish a post and forget to 
choose a category, you’ll ﬁ nd that WordPress has automatically placed it in the Uncategorized category 
(see Lesson 20 for ways to handle this category). 
The post I’m working on here is about a vacation package, so I’ll add a new category called Packages. 
Click the Add New Category link and you’ll see a text box appear like the one in Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8

47
Lesson 6: Adding a New Post — Overview
You enter the name of your category here. Just below the text box is a drop-down menu called Parent 
Category. This is used if you want your new category to be a subcategory of something else (you want it 
to be the child of a parent category). In this particular case, I don’t want Packages to be a subcategory of 
anything else, so I don’t touch Parent Category. 
When you click Add, you’ll see a yellow bar ﬂ ash at the top of the categories list and your new category 
appears with a check mark beside it, as shown in Figure 6-9A. 
However, I don’t want this post in the Packages category, I want it in a child or sub-category of Packages, 
but because Packages did not exist yet, I had to create it. So I uncheck Packages, go back to the Add New 
Category link, and enter Jamaica Packages in the new category box. Packages appears in the Parent Category 
list, so I choose that and click Add. The results are shown in Figure 6-9B (I’ve added a couple of other child 
categories under Packages to illustrate a point).
Figure 6-9
Normally categories are shown in alphabetical order, with child categories nested below parents, but 
notice that Jamaica Packages is listed at the top, out of order. When you have a lot of categories, it can be 
time consuming to scroll through to ﬁ nd the ones that your post is connected to, so WordPress moves 
those categories to the top of the list.
Remember too that adding categories, even though they’re checked off, does not mean they’ve been 
assigned to the post — that only happens when you Save Draft or Publish or Update Post.
Something I mentioned in Lesson 2 is worth repeating at this point: posts in child categories automatically 
are members of their parent categories. So, in the case of my post, I don’t need to check Packages — my post 
is automatically included in that category by being in Jamaica Packages. This is very useful because on the 
website I could have a listing that shows all Packages, including those for Jamaica, while also showing a list 
just for Jamaica.
Tags
Earlier I used the term speciﬁ c to describe tags. In the case of the current post, I categorized it under 
Jamaica Packages, but in the body of the text it talks about Kingston and all-inclusive resorts. Those are 
terms for which people might be interested in seeing all similar posts. One option would be to create 
a Kingston category, but there are so many cities in the Caribbean that the category structure would 
become bloated. However, if I make Kingston a tag — using the Post Tags box in Figure 6-10A — visitors 
could still see all posts tagged with “Kingston” just as if it were a category.

48
Part III: Working with Written Content
Figure 6-10
All I do is enter the tag in the text box. If you want to enter more tags, WordPress reminds you to sepa-
rate them with commas.
As you enter a word or phrase, WordPress checks existing tags and displays possible matches in a popup 
window, from which you can choose, as shown in Figure 6-10B. You can also click Choose from the Most 
Used Tags in Post Tags to get a list of popular tags on your site.
When you click Add, the tag(s) appear below the text box, with a small x beside them — see Figure 6-10C. 
This allows you to remove tags from a post later on. As always, remember to Save Draft, or Publish or 
Update your post because even though the tags appear under the text box, they’re not saved in the sys-
tem until you click “the big blue button.”
Publishing a Post
Once you have your post entered, tagged, and categorized, you need to decide what to do with it, and 
that’s where the Publish box comes in. The name is a bit misleading because publishing is only one of 
the options you have, but because it’s the most important of all the options here, it makes sense to use 
that title.
Figure 6-11 shows the Publish box in detail.
Figure 6-11
What jumps out at you ﬁ rst is the large blue Publish button. Clicking that makes your post live on your 
site. What’s handy about this button is that it will change depending on the context, so it will remind you 
of what action you’re about to take. For instance, once you’ve published a post, the button will say Update 
Post, or if you change the date of publication to one in the future, the button will say Schedule.

49
Lesson 6: Adding a New Post — Overview
Starting at the top of the Publish box, the ﬁ rst thing you notice is Save Draft, which I used for the Kingston 
post. If you’re not ready for the world to see your post just yet, you’ll want to use this button.
Status 
The Status menu allows you to move your post from one state to another depending on the post’s cur-
rent state. In other words, it’s a contextual menu. But to see that menu you need to click the Edit link 
beside the current status, and you get what’s shown in Figure 6-12.
Figure 6-12
Once you’ve chosen the new status, click OK and the menu disappears. If you decide not to change any-
thing, just click Cancel.
A post has four different states:
Draft
 
❑
Pending Review
 
❑
Scheduled
 
❑
Published
 
❑
Not all of these are shown at once — as I mentioned, this is a contextual menu — so you only have the 
possible choices open to you at any particular time.
Draft:
 
❑
 This means that the post is still in its early stages and not ready for any eyes, public or oth-
erwise. (Prior to version 2.8 WordPress sometimes uses the term “unpublished” in place of draft.)
Pending Review:
 
❑
 This is a state used when you have multiple authors and there’s an editor 
who will review the post before it’s published. When the post is ready for review you simply 
switch it from Draft to Pending Review. Items that are Pending Review are listed separately so, 
for example, someone who’s editing posts knows that those ones are ready to be checked over.
Scheduled: 
 
❑
This means the post will be published at a certain date and time in the future. You 
cannot change the status of a scheduled post by using this drop down menu. You must change 
the publication date and then update the post.
Published
 
❑
: This means the post is available on the website. Depending on the visibility settings 
it may not be visible to all visitors, but it’s available to whoever has permission to see it.

50
Part III: Working with Written Content
Visibility 
When publishing a post, you need to decide who exactly can see it when it’s live, and that’s the role of 
the Visibility menu. Again you’ll need to click the Edit link to see the menu shown in Figure 6-13.
Figure 6-13
Public:
 
❑
 This is the default setting and it means that anyone on the Internet will be able to see the 
post. You also have the option of making a public post sticky, which simply means that it does 
not get bumped down by newer posts as it normally would. This stickiness only applies to the 
front page blog posts, if you’ve chosen that as the content of your homepage.
Password Protected:
 
❑
 As the name implies, this means visitors will need to enter a password if 
they want to see the content of that particular post. You’ll need to select Password to see the 
entry box for the password. Enter it and click OK.
Password-protecting a post is a very handy feature because you might want to provide some exclusive 
content but don’t want to go to the trouble of creating a password-protected directory on the server for a 
single item or an item you only need protected for a short time. A good example would be a document you 
want to offer only to subscribers of a newsletter. You simply upload the document to a post, password-
protect the post, and then send out the URL and password in the newsletter. After a speciﬁ ed time, you 
just unpublish or delete the post.
Private:
 
❑
 This is different from password-protecting because all you need to see the post on the 
live site is to be logged in to WordPress. However, you must be logged in, either as an Editor or 
Administrator. Authors, Contributors, and Subscribers cannot see Private posts, though Authors 
can always see their own posts, even when they’re private (see Lesson 26 for the various roles in 
WordPress). 
When you’re ﬁ nished choosing among these, be sure to click the OK button and the new state will dis-
play beside Visibility. Remember that although it looks like you’re done, you must click Update Post (or 
Publish or Save Draft) for the change to actually be made.
Publish 
This setting determines when the post will be published, and the default is immediately. If you want to 
schedule the post to publish automatically in the future, click the Edit link and you’ll see the date dis-
play as shown in Figure 6-14.

51
Lesson 6: Adding a New Post — Overview
Figure 6-14
You can even set things up to publish at a speciﬁ c time of day. For instance, I often set press releases to 
publish the morning of the day I’m sending out e-mail notices about the release.
Because you can set any date you like, it’s possible to date a post in the past, but 
why would you want to do that? Suppose you had a press release that had been 
missed and you want it to appear in your archives in the proper order by date. 
Simply back date the post and hit publish.
Once you’ve set the date and time, just click OK and the new time appears next to Publish. And again, 
remember to click Schedule or Update Post (depending on what the big blue button says) or else your 
change won’t be saved.
Try It
In this lesson you create a new post, then schedule it for publishing at a later date.

enclosed DVD.

Working with the Text Editor
In Lesson 6 you learned the basics of using the WordPress Text Editor — now it’s time to examine 
its capabilities in detail. You learn the functions of each of the buttons on the button bar, includ-
ing plenty of little tricks to help make it easier to use this powerful tool. Mostly you’ll be working 
Visual mode, but this lesson also covers a bit of HTML mode.
Anatomy of the Text Editor
As you’ve seen, the Visual Text Editor has two rows of buttons. By default, only the ﬁ rst row is 
displayed and you have to access the second row by clicking the Kitchen Sink button (the very 
last button on the default row). I’ve created a visual directory of each row, so let’s begin with the 
default one.
You may have more buttons on your Text Editor if you have plugins installed on WordPress. If 
you install the TinyMCE Advanced plugin, you’ll also have more rows of buttons and the ability 
to move buttons around. Some plugins give you a different text box altogether. For the purposes 
of this lesson, however, I’m only covering the default Text Editor.

Finally, Figure 7-3 shows the single row of buttons for HTML mode.

Sizing the Text Editor
One way to change the size of the Visual Text Editor so you have more room to work is to locate the 
three lines on the lower right-hand corner of the editor box, shown in Figure 7-4, click them with your 
mouse, and drag the box downward (this does not work in HTML mode).
Figure 7-4
WordPress will remember the new height for as long as you’re logged in. If you would rather have the 
Text Editor larger by default each time you log in, you can change that under Settings ➪ Writing as 
shown in Figure 7-5 (the “Size of the post box” setting).

56
Part III: Working with Written Content
Figure 7-5
Keep in mind that this default sizing will apply to all users on the system, but they’ll still have the abil-
ity to resize the box each time they log in.
However, height isn’t always the only issue you may have with the size of the Text Editor. You could 
ﬁ nd your screen looking like Figure 7-6 (possible causes: as you add plugins to WordPress, they may 
place more buttons on your Text Editor or perhaps you’ve increased the text size of your browser and 
the button bar gets larger as a result, pushing the Text Editor to the right).
Figure 7-6

57
Lesson 7: Working with the Text Editor
Whatever the cause, you need to ﬁ nd more width and for that you have a few options:
 1. 
Increase the width of your browser window — the center column with the Text Editor is ﬂ uid 
and will expand with the window. 
 2. 
If you’re already at your screen’s limit, another option is to collapse the admin menu on the left 
side of the screen, as shown in Lesson 4.
 3. 
You can set the Text Editor to full screen mode. By clicking the Full Screen button the editor 
expands to take over the whole of your screen. The button bar remains visible at the top, along 
with the buttons for the Upload/Insert menu. To get back to the normal screen, just click the 
Full Screen button again.
 4. 
Finally, a method introduced in WordPress 2.8 is to make the Add New Post page have only one 
column instead of two. To change the columns, open up Screen Options at the top right and select 
“Number of Columns: 1”. All the boxes on the Add New Post screen will still be there; they’re 
simply moved into a single column with the Title and Text Editor at the top.
If you do change to a single column and then change back to two columns, 
WordPress does not automatically restore your screen. Instead it makes space for 
the second column and you’ll need to drag back the boxes you want to appear on 
the right-hand side.
StylingText
Whenever you’re thinking about styling some text, keep in mind these two points:
Does the styling help visitors understand what you’re saying in the post or is it simply adding 
 
❑
clutter to what they see, no matter how “pretty” it looks?
Take the example of making text bold, which was covered in the preceding lesson. If you 
use too much bold text on a page, the purpose begins to get lost. Everything becomes impor-
tant so nothing stands out properly. Like that.
Is this styling needed for this post alone or is it something that might better be handled by your 
 
❑
theme’s style sheet because you want to develop a standard style across multiple posts?
I often see people create special styles for a section heading on a post. Those headings are already 
controlled by your theme. Creating a style for a particular heading overrides what’s in the style 
sheet, and that’s okay, but maybe what you really want to do is change the style sheet so that all 
headings of that type look the same.
There isn’t time to go through all types of text styling here, and I cover the styling of large bodies of text 
in the next lesson, so I’ll cover just a few common issues.
Underlining
I’m not a fan of using the Underline function at all, at least not on the Web. I think it’s just too confusing 
to your visitors because underlined text spells “link” in their minds. They try clicking the underlined 
text and you either disappoint or confuse them. 

58
Part III: Working with Written Content
I know some uses of underline are actually required, such as in scholarly documents, but in cases like 
that, the visitor has some context and is familiar with the underlining. But if you need to emphasize text 
it’s usually best to stick to bold and italics, or perhaps color.
Coloring Text
Having mentioned coloring text, remember a few things before you start doing it:
Don’t use the same or similar color as the color of your text links or there’s going to be confu-
 
❑
sion for the visitor.
If you have colored headings in your theme, using the same color for pieces of text can also be 
 
❑
confusing, though a shade of that color maybe isn’t so bad.
Always think about the background color behind the text. You don’t want anything that’s going 
 
❑
to blend in too much with the background, especially when people are printing the page in 
black and white.
How, then, do you color text? It’s the button with the letter A on the second row of the Text Editor but-
ton bar. If you highlight some text and just click that button, it will turn the color of the small bar dis-
played on the button. If you want to change that color, click the down arrow and you get some preset 
choices. Click More Colors and you get a popup window where you can choose from any color.
The Formatting Menu 
The drop-down menu on the left-hand side of the second row of buttons can be a bit confusing at ﬁ rst. 
It seems to be, as the name suggests, a way of formatting text in different ways, but the trick is, these 
formats apply only to paragraphs. So, for example, if you highlight some text to be emphasized, and 
choose Heading 2, instead of those few words changing, the entire paragraph changes. Styling of para-
graphs is covered in more detail the next lesson, so for the moment I’ll leave it at this: don’t try to use 
formatting to highlight individual words or phrases. 
Working with Text Links
Creating links within the body of your text is important for leading visitors to more information — it’s 
one of the greatest strengths of web-based material. But it’s easy to mess up the formatting of links, so 
thankfully the WordPress Text Editor makes linking very simple. It’s not quite as straightforward as 
bolding, but you’re led through every step with an easy-to-use form.
Much of what is said here applies to creating links using images. Details about linking images are cov-
ered in Lesson 13.
The ﬁ rst thing to do is highlight the text that’s going to be linked. Sometimes deciding which text to 
link is fairly obvious: “I was reading an article in People magazine today and…” But the best rule of 
thumb is to link as much of the text as relates to where you want to take your visitor. 
Once your text is highlighted and you click the link button, you get a popup window like the one in 
Figure 7-7.

59
Lesson 7: Working with the Text Editor
Figure 7-7
As the name Insert/Edit Link suggests, this window is not only for adding new links, but also editing 
existing ones. 
Link URL is obviously where you’re going to put the address of the web page you’re linking to. WordPress 
automatically puts in the http:// so you’re not wondering whether it’s required. It’s also highlighted so 
that if you’re like me and paste URLs copied from your browser address bar, you’ll automatically erase 
the default text and not end up with http://http://.
Next, from the Target drop-down menu, you can decide whether you want your visitor to be taken to a 
new browser window (or tab) or to remain in the current window, with the new content replacing the 
existing content. If you don’t make any choice, the link will automatically stay in the current window 
and replace its contents.
Either way of handling this has pros and cons. I personally like it when a link opens in a new window 
or tab — I’m not a big fan of using the back button (which may explain why I have dozens and dozens 
of tabs and windows open at any one time). Others will say it’s confusing for new windows or tabs to 
be open, particularly when visitors end up with a whole raft of them. Do what you think best.
You can also give your link a Title, which is what people will see when they mouse over the link. This 
can also be helpful in search engine optimization, which I talk about in Lesson 30.
You don’t need to worry about the last option in this window — the Class of the link. This can be handy 
for advanced style sheet work, but mostly you can just leave it at Not Set.
Once you have everything entered, click Insert and you’ll see your text underlined and colored. Remember 
that this link format is just to help you distinguish the link in the Text Editor. How your links look on the 
web site depends on your style sheet. And of course, before leaving the screen, click Update Post or your 
nice new link will not be saved.

60
Part III: Working with Written Content
Creating E-Mail Links
Under the Link URL heading you also have the option of creating a link that starts up the visitors’ 
e-mail program and allows them to send you a message. Instead of a website address, you put this in 
the Link URL box: mailto:youremail@you.com. That will cause the link to open up the user’s e-mail 
program and place the e-mail address in the To: box of the new message.
If you’re concerned about spammers grabbing the e-mail address in the link, you have a couple of options: 
don’t create a link, but just put in an e-mail address formatted something like this: youremailATyouDOTcom. 
It doesn’t fool all spam robots, and isn’t as convenient for your visitors, but it can help control spam harvest-
ing and is simple to do.
A better option is to create a form through which people get in touch with you. A number of plugins for 
WordPress help you create forms, and I talk about those in Lesson 36.
Editing Links
To edit an existing link, just click it and you’ll see the two link buttons highlighted. Click the solid link 
button to get the popup window you saw earlier. You can change any of the options in the window and 
then click Update to save those changes and be taken back to the Text Editor.
If you want to change the highlighted link text, you simply erase words or insert words, and the link 
remains in place. If you want to change all of the wording, highlight the entire link and begin typing 
the new text. Be careful not to highlight anything beyond the link or else you’ll break it and you’ll need 
to create a whole new link.
If you want the link moved to new text elsewhere in the post, you could highlight the link, copy it, and 
paste it where you want. Then you would change the wording and ﬁ nally remove the earlier link. It’s 
probably just as easy, however, to copy the URL from the old link, remove it from that text, and create a 
new link using the copied URL.
Removing Links
I’ve been careful to use the phrase “remove a link” rather than “delete a link” because removing a link 
means you’re keeping the words that were linked. Deleting a link could mean that you want to get rid 
of the words as well as the link.
To delete a link you simply highlight words and delete them, but to remove a link you need to click the 
link itself and then choose the broken link button. You’ll see the underlining and the coloring removed 
from the words — then you know the link is no longer functioning.
When removing links, remember that you need to Update your post for the change to take effect. 
Because you didn’t alter any wording it’s easy to forget.

61
Lesson 7: Working with the Text Editor
Importing Text
Nobody likes typing when you’re just re-entering things into a post, so copying and pasting is a popu-
lar sport. Quite often, though, you’re copying from a source that can cause you problems by carrying 
hidden coding with it.
I often have clients say to me that they can’t change a certain part of their text, no matter what they try 
to do in the Text Editor. A look behind the scenes in HTML mode quickly reveals the problem: hidden 
coding that’s controlling the look of the text. In Figure 7-8, compare the text on the left — what the per-
son saw in her word processor and wanted to copy — with the actual coding that got pasted into the 
WordPress Text Editor.
Figure 7-8
Because of the way style sheets work, this coding takes precedence over anything in your style sheet. 
Then there’s the problem of excess coding — you get a few of these on a page and it can make your 
HTML bloated and slower to load.
One way around the problem is to put any text into a simple text editor program ﬁ rst (such as Notepad 
on Windows or TextEdit on Mac) and then copy and paste from there. The excess coding will be 
stripped off in the process, and that includes all formatting, even bold and italics. 
If you want to try and preserve some basic formatting, so you don’t have to reconstruct it in the Text 
Editor, you can try using one of the Paste buttons. There’s one for text copied from Word and one for 
pasting text from other sources. The Word button is most commonly used and reports vary on what 
formatting will be preserved from your document, so it’s really a matter of trying it out. Basic things like 
bold text usually make it through the process, but complex layouts like tables and so on typically do not.

Laying Out Text
Now that you know how to style bits of text, it’s time to look at styling larger blocks using the Text 
Editor and laying out entire posts. In this lesson you learn how the Text Editor behaves and tips 
for how to arrange your written content effectively. In the end, it always comes down to what’s 
easiest for your visitors to read.
Styling Paragraphs
I’m using the term paragraph to refer to any block of text that you’ve separated in the Text Editor 
by using the Enter key. That’s because in HTML terms, the Text Editor sees any text separated in 
that way — even a single sentence — as a paragraph.
Aligning
To change the alignment of a paragraph, you simply need to click anywhere in the paragraph 
(there’s no need to highlight the whole paragraph, though you can) and then click the appropriate 
alignment button — left, center, and right appear on the top row of the button bar. 
There’s a fourth alignment button that’s only visible on the second row of the button bar, and 
that’s for justiﬁ ed alignment. This is when text lines up ﬂ ush on the left and the right, as shown in 
Figure 8-1.
Though the symmetry of this look pleases one part of my brain, there’s another part that says 
“isn’t that gap between words the same gap that indicates the end of a sentence?” Still worse is 
when justiﬁ cation is used on very narrow paragraphs, resulting in gigantic gaps between words. 
As a rule, I never use justiﬁ cation, but if you do, make sure your aesthetics aren’t getting in the 
way of readability for your visitors.

64
Part II: Working with Written Content
Figure 8-1
A common misconception is that if you have a paragraph aligned right, center, or 
justiﬁ ed, to return it to the standard left align, you have to click the Align Left but-
ton. However, the default alignment in HTML is to the left, so all you need to do is 
click the same alignment button (that turns off the alignment) and the text will go 
back to the left.
Blockquotes
A blockquote is an HTML tag for designating a block of quoted text. This is usually displayed indented 
from both the left and the right. That’s certainly how blockquotes display in the WordPress Text Editor, 
and they’re typically used for quoting more than a sentence or two from books or other websites and so 
on. However, most WordPress themes like to style blockquotes in more creative ways, as you can see in 
Figure 8-2.
Creating a blockquote is easy. You simply place your cursor in the paragraph you want or highlight 
multiple paragraphs, and then click Blockquote. On the Jamaica page of Island Travel, I have a quote 
from a travel guide website. Rather than simply putting quotes around the two paragraphs, I want to 
really set them apart from the other text, so I use a blockquote — you can see the difference on the live 
site in Figure 8-3.

65
Lesson 8: Laying Out Text
Figure 8-2
Figure 8-3

66
Part II: Working with Written Content
Notice too that I created a link to the site where I got the quote. I want to give them credit and it also 
allows visitors to easily get more information. The other site will also appreciate the link and not just 
the fact that you quoted them.
Indenting
When you want to visually set off a paragraph from other text, you can use the Indent button. One 
click moves the paragraph to the right, while a second click moves it further right, and so on. You use 
the Outdent button to incrementally move the paragraph back to left. To achieve this effect, WordPress 
uses what’s called inline styling. That means the style is controlled in the HTML instead of in your 
theme’s style sheet. 
If you indent some text and look at the HTML coding, it will say something like <p style= 
”padding-left: 30px;”> or 60px, 90px, and so on depending on how far right you’re indenting. 
This coding tells the browser to move the paragraph over to the right by whatever number of pixels, 
and those numbers are set by WordPress.
At ﬁ rst it may look like indenting a paragraph isn’t much different than using blockquotes, as illus-
trated in Figure 8-4.
Figure 8-4
The only real difference seems to be that blockquotes are indented from both the left and the right, but 
as you saw earlier, that right-hand indent may not exist in the styling created by WordPress themes. So 
what really is different about indenting?

67
Lesson 8: Laying Out Text
Indenting is meant to set off your own text, while blockquotes are for long quotations of other people’s 
text. This is not a WordPress convention, but a function of the HTML tags that control the two. HTML 
tags are used not just to control style, but also to convey meaning (to search engine robots for example). 
The blockquote tag conveys that the text is a quotation from some other source, while the paragraph 
tags used to create indents do not. From this perspective, using blockquotes for your own text would 
be confusing, not just to search engines, but visually as well — your text would look the same as quotes 
you’ve used from others.
Creating Lists
Lists are very useful because they help break up information into more manageable pieces. On the Web 
in particular, people have become used to seeing information not only in smaller pieces, but in visually 
helpful structures, and lists are one of the most important of those.
In HTML, lists are either ordered or unordered, which basically means they’re either displayed auto-
matically numbered or with bullets. If you delete an item in an ordered list, the remaining items are 
automatically renumbered, whereas an unordered list only has the same bullet beside each item and 
nothing changes if an item is deleted. Figure 8-5 shows an example of each type of list, with its corre-
sponding button highlighted.
Figure 8-5
If you’re not keen on the heavy black bullet effect of the unordered list, rest easy. Your WordPress 
theme very likely will render that more elegantly, and if it doesn’t I will talk about that kind of styling 
in Lesson 29. You can always check how your list will actually look on your site by clicking Preview.
Beginning a New List
To begin either type of list, start a new paragraph (hit Enter or Return) and then click the appropriate 
button on the button bar. You’ll see the cursor indent with a round black bullet for unordered lists or a 
number 1 for ordered lists. 
If you click a list button while you’re at the end of a paragraph (or anywhere inside a paragraph), that 
paragraph becomes the ﬁ rst item in the list. To return the paragraph to normal, just click the same list 
button (it’ll be highlighted).

68
Part II: Working with Written Content
After you’ve entered the ﬁ rst item on your list, simply hit Enter and you’ll begin a new list item. Keep 
doing that until you’ve entered all the items on your list. To end the list, simply hit Enter after the ﬁ nal 
list item, as though you’re starting a new item, and then hit Enter again. The new item bullet or number 
disappears and your cursor returns to the far left of the Text Editor, ready to begin a new paragraph. 
Working with Existing Text and Lists
If you want to turn existing text into a list, you need to make sure that each item in the list is a paragraph, 
which really means that each item has to be separated by hitting Enter after it. For example, if I have a 
paragraph describing the features of a resort, I can’t simply highlight the paragraph and click a list button. 
The entire paragraph would become a single list item. What I need to do is go through the paragraph and 
hit Enter after each sentence, then highlight all these “paragraphs” and click a list button.
Converting an existing list to the other type of list is even simpler. Just highlight all the list items and 
click the other list button. Your ordered list instantly becomes an unordered list, or vice versa. Unlike 
paragraphs, for which you can place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and apply certain styling to 
the whole (such as alignment or making it a blockquote), you must highlight the entire list to convert it. 
If you just place your cursor somewhere in the list, you’ll only convert the list item you’re on.
If you want to de-list some or all items in a list, highlight the ones to be converted and click the appro-
priate list button. Each list item becomes an individual paragraph. If you’ve only de-listed some items, 
the rest remain in list format and, if it’s an ordered list, they automatically renumber. If the de-listed 
item(s) is in the middle, you end up with two independent lists, one above and one below, and if the 
original was an ordered list, the two remaining lists will renumber themselves separately.
Tips for Laying Out Posts
My ﬁ rst tip for laying out the text in a post is to ask yourself whether you might not be better off with one 
or more smaller posts. I say this because often when people are asking about layout it’s because they have 
a lot of material to deal with and they’re not sure how to break it up visually. And sometimes the answer 
to that is to break it up into separate posts or pages.
In the case of posts, for example, I talked about testimonials when I was planning the Island Travel site 
in Lesson 2. Instead of having all the testimonials on a single page in WordPress, I talked about how 
useful it would be to put each individual testimonial into a post. Part of that usefulness is that I don’t 
have to ﬁ gure out how to lay out a giant page of testimonials — the work is done for me when I call up 
the Testimonials category, and all of the testimonials are displayed as individual posts with headings 
and other visual separators.
In the case of pages, when there’s a lot of content on a single page, ask yourself whether your visitors 
wouldn’t be better served by breaking it up into separate pages, each with its own focus. The goal 
here is not to save yourself the trouble of laying out a lot of text on a page — that’s just a side beneﬁ t 
of thinking about whether your visitors are having to sift through a lot of material that could be in 
relevant chunks. 

69
Lesson 8: Laying Out Text
Making Use of Headings
The most important thing to remember when you’re laying out a post with a large amount of text is to 
break up things using headings. Not only is this helpful to your readers by breaking things up for them 
visually, but it’s also useful for search engines that use headings to understand the relative importance 
of chunks of data. That’s why you also need to use the headings in the Text Editor in a logical way.
Just as the structure in Figure 8-6 would not make much sense to your visitors, it would bafﬂ e a search 
engine as well.
That’s because Heading 2 is being used in a subsection of a Heading 3 section.
Figure 8-6
One of the most common confusions about using headings is the amount of spacing between a head-
ing and the previous paragraph. What you see in the Text Editor may seem like too small a space, so 
the tendency is to want to hit Enter a few times and create more space. As you’ll recall from earlier, that 
appears to work while you’re typing in the Text Editor, but as soon as you save the post, those spaces 
will disappear and they don’t show on the live site either.
If you want more space between a Heading 2 and the text just above it, you need to change your theme’s 
style sheet — keeping in mind that this change may apply to every Heading 2 on your site.

collapsing or hiding them, but you can arrange things however you want. If anything, I might hide the 
Send Trackbacks box because it’s the one I use the least. I discuss the role of Trackbacks in Lesson 25 so 
I’ll pass over it here.
Custom Fields is a feature that allows users to create ﬁ elds in the WordPress database for storing addi-
tional information. You would only be creating new ﬁ elds if you learned how to incorporate them into 
your Theme ﬁ les, but that’s beyond the scope of this book.
However, you may well use the Custom Fields box depending on what plugins you install. Some of 
them will use Custom Fields, either to display information about a post or to ask you to enter informa-
tion. Sometimes a theme author will use Custom Fields and provide you with instructions on using the 
ﬁ elds he’s set.
Typically, though, you won’t need to deal with the Custom Fields box at all.
The Post Author box should show whatever name you’ve selected in your personal proﬁ le as your dis-
play name. If you haven’t made any choice, the default is to show your WordPress username. If you have 
multiple users who are able to write or edit posts, their names will appear on this drop down list. In the 
case of the Island Travel site, for example, you might create a post for a press release and then change the 
author to a different staff member so they have permission to go in and edit the release. There may also 
be instances when you’re ghost-writing an item for another user, so you change the author drop down to 
give them the credit for the post.
Excerpts and the More Button
WordPress has what I think is a very elegant system for handling short summaries of posts:
There’s the More button, which allows you to control each post individually and decide 
 
❑
whether the full text is displayed or only a portion of it with a Read More link.
There’s the Excerpt feature, which functions automatically on all posts. Not all themes use the 
 
❑
Excerpt feature, but the nice thing is, if yours does, and you don’t put anything in the Excerpt 
box, the system simply uses the ﬁ rst 55 words of the post.
The More button is easy to use. Simply place your cursor at the point in the text where you want to cut off 
the post and display a Read More link, and click More. Your Text Editor changes to look like Figure 9-2. 
That line does not show up in the full text of the post — it’s only there as a marker so you know where 
you’ve set it. The easiest way to get rid of the More line is to click it so that you see drag points around 
its edges, and then hit Delete on your keyboard. Don’t click the More button or you’ll just get another 
More line.
Even if your theme does not currently use the Excerpt feature, it’s worth considering whether the open-
ing lines of your post are sufﬁ cient or if you’d like to enter a special summary in the Excerpt box while 
you’re adding a new post. That way, some time in the future, if you use another theme or modify the 
current one to use excerpts, you won’t need to go back through everything and add an excerpt where 
you want one.

Lesson 9: Advanced Post Options
Figure 9-2
Discussion and Comments
The Discussion box is the place where you can override two of the site-wide parameters set under 
Settings ➪ Discussion: comments and trackbacks/pingbacks. By default WordPress allows both for all 
posts or pages, so unless you’ve changed anything in Settings, both boxes will be checked, as you saw 
in Figure 9-1.
It might be tempting to use your Screen Options and get rid of this box altogether — the general discus-
sion settings are set up so why bother having this box at all? I ﬁ nd it’s helpful, however, to be reminded 
that these options are available whenever adding or editing a post.
You’ve probably seen blogs where it says that comments are now closed. On WordPress 
you can set comments to automatically close after a ﬁ xed period of time — see under 
Settings ➪ Discussion — or if you want individual control just go to the post and 
uncheck the Allow Comments box. Existing comments will continue to display but 
no new ones can be entered.
Handling Revisions
Has this ever happened to you? You completely rewrite something on a web page, save it, and then dis-
cover a week later that the new information is wrong and you don’t have a copy of the original. That’s 
where WordPress’s revision feature comes in handy.

74
Part II: Working with Written Content
You may remember that WordPress has an auto-save feature that regularly saves what you’re working 
on, but once you’ve published, saved, or updated a post, WordPress also starts keeping a copy of ear-
lier versions of the post. A list of these revisions displays at the bottom of your post as you can see in 
Figure 9-3. 
Figure 9-3
This box did not show in the overview image because there are no revisions when you’re creating a new 
post. Once you save it and make your ﬁ rst changes, the revisions begin to accumulate and show up on 
this list.
The process of changing a page back to an earlier state is called restoring and the way to do that is to click 
the revision you want. If you’re not sure which revision it is, don’t worry, clicking here does not restore 
anything yet. What you get is the HTML for the earlier version of the post, as shown in Figure 9-4.
If this isn’t the right version, you can look at others until you ﬁ nd the right one. I’ve trimmed the height 
of the screen so you can also see the bottom menu, where all the revisions are listed again. You’ll see 
that the revision you chose has one of the radio buttons highlighted, and at the top of the list is the cur-
rent version of the post and it too has a highlighted radio button. Those highlighted buttons mean you 
can compare those two versions by clicking Compare Revisions. If you want to compare two different 
revisions, click their respective radio buttons, one in the left column and one in the right.
When you do a comparison between two revisions, you get the HTML of each one side by side with 
different colored backgrounds for paragraphs with differences, and the text that’s different in each is 
highlighted in a darker color, as demonstrated in Figure 9-5.

75
Lesson 9: Advanced Post Options
Figure 9-4
Figure 9-5
If you want to use a revision, simply click the Restore link to the right of the revision date. If you decide 
you want the current post to stay as it is, just click the date of the current post (always at the top and 
labeled “current”) and you’ll return to the Edit Post screen.

Part II: Working with Written Content
Try It
In this lesson you create a Read More breakpoint in the text of a post.
Lesson Requirements
A post with at least three or four paragraphs of text. This works with pages, but it’s easier to see the 
effect quickly in a post. 
Step-by-Step
 1. 
Make sure you’re in the Visual mode of the Text Editor.
2. 
Place your cursor at least three sentences into the ﬁ rst paragraph of the post.
 3. 
Click the More button on the top row of the button bar.
4. 
A line with the word “More” should appear where your cursor is.
 5. 
Click Update Post.
6. 
Navigate to a category that contains the post you just edited.
 7. 
Unless you have a lot of posts in that category, the one you edited should be near the top. You 
should see the words Read More... after two or three sentences (55 words).
8. 
Click Read More to test that you’re taken to the full version of the post (without the Read More 
or the More line visible).
To see some of the examples from this lesson, including viewing revisions, 
watch the video for Lesson 9 on the enclosed DVD.

Adding a New Page
Virtually everything covered so far about writing content applies to both posts and pages in 
WordPress. I’ve also covered the key functions unique to posts, such as categories and tags. Now, 
in this lesson, it’s time to cover the functions unique to WordPress pages, such as using page tem-
plates or creating sub-pages.
Pages vs. Posts
In older versions of WordPress there was often only one word on the entire screen to visually tell 
you whether you were about to add a post or a page. In the most recent versions there are enough 
differences to easily avoid that confusion, as you can see from the tops of both screens shown in 
Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1
The more common problem these days is a conceptual one: how exactly do posts and pages differ? 
A detailed discussion of this was covered in Lesson 1, but it’s worth running over a couple of points 
again here.

78
Part II: Working with Written Content
If you’re simply running a blog, the distinction is fairly clear: most of the content of your site is in the 
form of posts, with the newest ones displaying on the homepage, whereas pages are used occasionally 
for content that rarely changes. However, if you’re using WordPress to run a website (assuming for a 
moment that it has no blog section), pages take on a more important role and posts are more isolated 
bits of information rather than all belonging to “a blog.”
Organizational structure — categories and tags vs. pages and sub-pages — is the primary difference 
between posts and pages, but a couple of other differences exist when working in the Add/Edit screens. 
Let’s have a look at those next.
The Add Page Options
The ﬁ rst thing you notice is that there are fewer options on an Add New Page screen, as this overview 
in Figure 10-2 demonstrates.
Figure 10-2
Gone from this screen are Tags and Categories, Excerpts, and Trackbacks. There are several new options 
over on the right-hand side in the Attributes box.

79
Lesson 10: Adding a New Page
I’ll leave the ﬁ rst of these — Parent — for the next section. The option below it is the Template menu. 
This displays all the page templates available for the theme you’re currently using. For the default 
theme, the drop-down looks like Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3
Page templates have layouts that can differ from the default page layout as much as the theme devel-
oper likes, though typically what these templates do is display speciﬁ c information. In the case of the 
default theme, for example, the Links template shows all of the link categories as a series of lists. You 
wouldn’t even need to enter any text for that page, other than the title.
Below the Template menu is the Order input box. In the automatic page menu that WordPress generates, 
pages are ordered alphabetically according to their titles. You can override that by entering numbers in 
the Order boxes for each page. It can be a bit cumbersome if you have a lot of pages and need to change 
the order at some point, but it works. Plugins are available for WordPress that offer simpler ways of 
handling this, the most popular of which is My Page Order.
Creating Sub-Pages
The other option in the Attributes box of the Add New Page screen is the Parent menu. This drop 
down — shown in Figure 10-4 — allows you to choose a parent for the page you’re creating; that is, 
you can make it a sub-page of some existing page. 
As you can see from this, some of the pages are shown with an indent. That means they’re sub-pages of 
the ﬁ rst ﬂ ush-left page above it. In a very complex web setup you could have sub-pages of sub-pages, as 
deeply nested as you need.
You can change the relationship of a page to other pages at any time by using this same drop-down 
menu while editing the page.

The Basics of Handling 
Media Files
Up to now you’ve learned about entering, editing, styling, and laying out text content. In this lesson 
you begin the same process for media ﬁ les, which primarily means images, but also includes video, 
audio, and documents. It’s important to understand how WordPress organizes these ﬁ les so I’ll start 
with that, and then you will learn the basics of uploading and inserting an image into a post.
The Media Library vs. Galleries
As you explore the admin section of WordPress you’ll notice a number of places for adding images 
and other media ﬁ les. There’s the Add New button in the Media area of the side menu or the short-
cut menu at the top, both shown in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1

84
Part IV: Working with Media Content
As you saw in earlier lessons, there is also the Upload/Insert menu of the Text Editor for posts (as 
always I’m using “posts” to mean posts or pages).
But before you go crazy with uploading from any of these spots, let’s take a moment and talk about how 
WordPress thinks about media ﬁ les and organizes them. You’ll see that, when it comes to uploading, 
what matters is location, location, location.
WordPress organizes media ﬁ les in two ways: the media library and galleries.
The media library is a list of every ﬁ le you’ve ever uploaded to your site and from it you can access 
those ﬁ les from anywhere on the site.
A gallery, on the other hand, lists only the media ﬁ les associated with that gallery’s post.
What do I mean by associated? That’s where things get a little complicated. A media ﬁ le becomes asso-
ciated with a post by 1) being uploaded into WordPress through the Upload/Insert menu for that post 
or 2) having its ﬁ rst insertion from the media library into that post (it can be inserted into other posts 
later, but will only be associated with that ﬁ rst post).
Think of it this way: whenever you upload a ﬁ le into WordPress, you’re uploading it into the media 
library. But if the upload is done through the Upload/Insert menu of a particular post, the ﬁ le is also 
associated with that and only that post. This means that all media ﬁ les necessarily are in the media 
library, but not all ﬁ les are necessarily in a gallery.
Why have galleries at all? Why not just a media library? Galleries are useful because they group related 
ﬁ les together for easier retrieval and also allow you to easily display sets of images — image galleries — 
with just a click of a button, a topic I cover in detail in Lesson 15.
You’ll sometimes see the term attachments used to refer to ﬁ les that are in a gallery. It’s just another way 
of describing the relationship of certain media ﬁ les to a post, and this relationship is used by plugins 
and customizations to do all sorts of cool things.
Understanding these relationships will not only help you think of ways to use media ﬁ les in 
WordPress, but it will help avoid two common confusions:
I inserted a photo into a post but it doesn’t show up in the gallery. 
That’s because you “borrowed” an image from the media library that had already been inserted 
into at least one other post, so it’s permanently associated with some other post.
I uploaded an image to a post for a particular use and now it’s also showing up in the gallery of images I 
created for that post.
Any image you upload to a post becomes part of any image gallery in the body of the post. If 
you don’t want this new image in the image gallery, you would need to upload it to the media 
library instead, insert it into some other post ﬁ rst, and then insert it into the post you’re deal-
ing with.

85
Lesson 11: The Basics of Handling Media Files
The Upload/Insert Menu
You saw the Upload/Insert menu when you explored the WordPress Text Editor, but look at it in detail 
now using Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2
The title of this menu is important because it’s a reminder that it fulﬁ lls two functions, both of which 
are completely separate: uploading media ﬁ les and inserting them into the post. You can upload media 
ﬁ les and not insert them into the post, and you can insert media ﬁ les that were previously uploaded.
The four icons represent four types of media ﬁ les. From left to right (with examples of ﬁ le types) they are:
Images (photos, graphics — jpg, gif, png)
 
❑
Video (swf, mp4, wmv, avi, mov, and so on)
 
❑
Audio (mp3, ram, and so on)
 
❑
Other Media (doc, ppt, xls, zip, and so on)
 
❑
If you forget which is which, you just need to mouseover one and you’ll see the name of it.
Click any of these icons and you get a popup screen where you perform the upload or insert functions. 
I go into all the details of those screens in Lessons 12 and 13. For the moment, I want to show you the 
basic steps for getting an image into a post. 
Inserting an Image into a Post
The most common way you’ll add images is when you’re working on a post, so to demonstrate I’ll 
upload a photo as part of a post about a vacation package on the Island Travel site. I begin by locating 
the Image icon of the Upload/Insert menu that you saw in Figure 11-2.

86
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Clicking that icon produces the popup window in Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-3
The photos are on my computer, so I can use the default From Computer tab.
I click the Choose button and up pops a browse window showing my computer. I locate the image 
I want, highlight it, and click the Select button (or whatever your browser displays), as shown in 
Figure 11-4. 
Figure 11-4
At that point the browse window disappears and WordPress displays a progress bar for the uploading 
of the images. Depending on the size of the image it could take a little while. When it’s ﬁ nished, you see 
a thumbnail of the image with a whole lot of options, as shown in Figure 11-5 (you’ll probably need to 
scroll to see all this, depending on the size of your screen).
Don’t worry about all those options right now. What I’m looking for is the Insert Into Post button down 
at the bottom left. I click that, the popup window disappears, and I see the image in the body of my 
post, as in Figure 11-6.
Remember to click the post’s Update button and you can click Preview to see what your image will look 
like on the live site.

the enclosed DVD.

The Upload/Insert Window Tabs
When you click one of the icons on the Upload/Insert menu and the window pops up, you see 
tabs in that window, and in this lesson you learn what they each mean. Brieﬂ y, here’s what they 
do in order from left to right:
From Computer:
 
❑
 This is for uploading ﬁ les from your computer.
From URL:
 
❑
 This is for creating links to ﬁ les elsewhere on the Web. 
Gallery:
 
❑
 This displays a list of every media ﬁ le (not just images) that has been uploaded 
to this post. They may not all have been inserted into the text, but they were all uploaded 
in WordPress through this post. This Gallery tab is also used to insert a thumbnail list of 
all images into the post.
Media Library:
 
❑
 This is for inserting any ﬁ les already listed in your media library.
The following sections cover each of these tabs in some detail.
The From Computer Tab
Because the From Computer tab is the one you’ll use the most, and it’s the default tab when the 
window opens, let’s start with it, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1

90
Part IV: Working with Media Content
You’re told to “Choose ﬁ les to upload” and the good news is that they really do mean ﬁ les, so you can pro-
cess many ﬁ les at one time instead of having to choose them one by one. The not so good news is that this 
uploading system, which uses Flash, doesn’t always work on every browser. In fact, WordPress even tells 
you that and offers an alternative Browser Uploader link. So if you don’t see a Choose button, just click the 
browser link and you’ll get a regular upload function — only you’ll have to do it one ﬁ le at a time.
As you saw earlier, the upload window displays a bar showing the progress of the upload, shown in 
Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2
If you’re uploading multiple ﬁ les, there will be a separate progress bar for each one, all running at the 
same time.
What you see after uploading is ﬁ nished depends on whether you’re uploading multiple ﬁ les or just 
one. If it’s several ﬁ les, you’ll see a thumbnail for each ﬁ le with a Show link, as illustrated in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3

91
Lesson 12: The Upload/Insert Window Tabs
If you’re uploading just one ﬁ le, you’ll get a larger thumbnail and a whole series of options (the ones you 
would see if you clicked the Show link for multiple ﬁ les). These options will vary depending on the type 
of media ﬁ le you’re uploading. I cover the options for images in Lesson 13, and the others I cover at points 
when I’m talking about that particular ﬁ le type.
The one option shared by all screens is the ability to either Insert the ﬁ le into your post or Save it for 
future use.
The From URL Tab
This is the place to insert media ﬁ les that are located on a site other than your own. You may want to use 
this option in cases where you run multiple websites and have an image or document common to all, so 
you simply use the URL on all the sites. Another example is when a company whose product you’re sell-
ing provides you with a URL to an image of the product — this is where you’d insert that URL.
You can’t just start grabbing images from anywhere — you need to have permis-
sion to use the image, not just for copyright reasons, but because you’re using their 
server’s bandwidth to load the image.
As you can see in Figure 12-4, unlike the From Computer tab, you’re presented with all the options right 
up front.
Figure 12-4
Notice that the title says “Add media ﬁ le from URL” and the options say “Image.” The reason for that 
is you’ll have different options in the From URL tab depending on which icon you chose from the 
Upload/Insert menu. In this case I had chosen the image icon.

92
Part IV: Working with Media Content
I cover the details of each type of option in the lesson for that particular media type, but there is one 
option that’s the same on all From URL tabs, and that’s the URL box.
You’ll need the full URL for the media ﬁ le in a form like this: http://www.somedomain.com/folder/
filename.extension. (The extension is the .jpg, .avi, .pdf, and so on.)
Type or paste that URL into the URL box. As soon as you move your cursor off that box, you’ll see a tiny 
spinning graphic to the left of the URL box. If WordPress successfully locates the ﬁ le, you’ll see a green 
check mark — if not you’ll see a red X after a certain amount of trying. An example of each is shown in 
Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5
If you get the red X, you’ll need to make sure you typed in the URL correctly (that’s why I prefer to 
copy and paste) or that you’ve actually copied the right URL. 
You can usually get the URL by right-clicking an image, pdf, video, or other media 
ﬁ le and selecting Copy Image Location (Firefox), or Properties and then highlight-
ing the URL and copying it (Internet Explorer).
The other option that all From URL tabs share is the Insert Into Post button. It will remain grayed out 
until WordPress has conﬁ rmed the existence of the ﬁ le and given you the green check mark. At that 
point you can do the insert. There’s no Save function because you can’t put these ﬁ les into the gallery 
or the media library.
Keep in mind that if you don’t have control over the URL where the ﬁ le is located, 
it could disappear in the future without warning, so you’ll need to keep an eye on 
such ﬁ les so your visitors aren’t left with broken images/links.
The Gallery Tab
You will not always see a Gallery tab when you click a button on the Upload/Insert menu. Only if there 
is at least one item already in the gallery will you see the tab. The number in the bracket on the tab title 
is the total number of media ﬁ les in the post’s gallery — that’s all media ﬁ les, not just images.
Figure 12-6 shows an example of the screen you get when you click the Gallery tab.

93
Lesson 12: The Upload/Insert Window Tabs
Figure 12-6
The Gallery Settings area at the bottom is where you create image galleries for your posts, and I deal 
with that in Lesson 15. Right now, I’m focused on the top area, which, as I said, displays all media, not 
just images.
On the left-hand side you’ll see image thumbnails or icons representing other types of media ﬁ les. On 
the right of each ﬁ le is a Show link. Clicking that reveals all the options for the particular type of ﬁ le, 
including the option to insert the ﬁ le into the post. While the options are displayed, this link will say 
Hide — click it to hide the options.
There’s also the option at the top of the screen called All Tabs: Show, and by clicking that you’ll open 
the options for all ﬁ les at one time. Just click Hide to close them all up again.
Next to All Tabs is a small menu called Sort Order and this is part of how you control the order of images 
when you’ve inserted an image gallery into a post — something I cover in Lesson 15 — so you don’t need 
to worry about it at this point. 
The Media Library Tab
What you get in this tab is a quickie version of what you would see under Media ➪ Library in the main 
admin menu. It allows you to see every media ﬁ le that’s been uploaded to your site and use it in the 
post you’re working on. An example is shown in Figure 12-7.

94
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 12-7
As you can see it’s very similar to the Gallery tab with the thumbnails on the left and the Show link on 
the right. If there are more than 10 items in the library, you’ll see pagination at the top right, allowing 
you to navigate through numerous screens of ﬁ le listings.
Most of the time you’ll be working with images and if you click the Media Library 
tab, you might wonder where all your PDFs or other media ﬁ les have gone. That’s 
because by default WordPress shows you only the ﬁ le type you’re working on. You 
need to click All Types at the top right of the Media Library tab to see every ﬁ le in 
the library.
From this tab you can not only insert a media ﬁ le into your post, but you can change the options on 
those ﬁ les whether or not you’re inserting them. Whether you change the options on one or more ﬁ les, 
be sure to click Save Changes at the bottom left. It may or may not be visible depending on the height of 
your screen, so you may need to scroll down to see it.
I’ve been talking here about the Media Library tab, but in Lesson 19 I cover the media library itself, 
which you access from the Admin menu.

Lesson 12: The Upload/Insert Window Tabs
Try It
In this lesson you practice inserting an image into a post using the From URL tab.
Lesson Requirements
An existing post and have in mind an image on your website that you’d like to insert into your post (or 
if you have permission for an image on another site).
Step-by-Step
 1. 
Open a post for editing.
2. 
Click the image icon of the Upload/Insert menu. 
 3. 
Click From URL.
4. 
In a separate tab of your browser, ﬁ nd the page with the image you want to insert.
 5. 
Right-click the image and choose View Image or Show Picture — if neither is available, choose 
Properties and highlight the URL in the popup window.
6. 
If View Image or Show Picture works, you’ll see the image by itself in your browser — copy the 
URL in the address bar.
 7. 
Paste the address for the image into the Image URL ﬁ eld.
8. 
Click the Image Title or any other ﬁ eld.
 9. 
A small spinning circle displays beside Image URL, indicating it’s checking that your image is 
where you say it is.
10. 
If the image is found, you’ll see a green check mark.
 11. 
If the image is not found, you’ll see a red X.
12. 
Assuming you get a check mark, choose an Alignment.
 13. 
If you want the image to link somewhere, enter that URL in the Link Image To ﬁ eld.
14. 
Click Insert Into Post.
 15. 
Click Preview to see the image in your post.
To see some of the examples from this lesson, watch the video for Lesson 12 on 
the enclosed DVD.


Image Options in Detail
When I showed you the procedure for uploading and inserting an image into a post, you brieﬂ y 
saw the options screen for the image, and I talked about some of the choices you could make. This 
lesson examines those options in detail.

WordPress makes it easy to add various types of text to your image — shown in Figure 13-1 — 
each of which serves a particular function.
Figure 13-1

98
Part IV: Working with Media Content
WordPress automatically extracts some of the data embedded in digital images (aperture, shutter speed, 
and so on) and stores it in its database. If your image has an embedded title and caption, they’ll be dis-
played in the screen shown in Figure 13-1. The other data are used by plugins or you could make use of 
them through customized theme ﬁ les.
Title
WordPress automatically gives the image a title, using the name of the ﬁ le minus its extension (.jpg, .gif, 
and so on). You don’t have to change the image title, but it makes a lot of sense because it’s the wording that 
will show up when people mouseover the image and it’s also used for the name of the image in various 
contexts, such as when you create image galleries. Besides, six months later when you’re looking through 
the media library, you’ll appreciate “Sailboat off Cape Cod” much more than “img000534.”
If the default title does not look exactly like the name of the ﬁ le you uploaded, that’s because WordPress 
cleans up names by stripping them of spaces, changing upper- to lowercase, and adding numbers if 
there’s a ﬁ le of that name already in the system.
Caption
As the name suggests, any text entered here automatically displays as a caption when you insert an 
image into a post or beneath the thumbnail when you insert a gallery. Figure 13-2 shows the actual 
placement of the caption in a published post and a common way of styling it (this will vary depending 
on your theme’s style sheet).
Figure 13-2
The caption also serves as the ALT text that displays if someone has images turned off and it’s also use-
ful for search engines — something I talk about in Lesson 30.

99
Lesson 13: Image Options in Detail
In the case of thumbnails for an image gallery, the only way to prevent a caption from 
appearing is to delete the content from this ﬁ eld. For single inserted images, you can 
remove the caption from that instance of the image by going into the HTML editor view 
and deleting the caption text. That way the caption is still available for the image’s 
thumbnail in an image gallery or another use of the image in another post.
Description
This setting allows you to provide a lot more detail about the ﬁ le. Where or if the description gets 
used will depend on your theme. In the case of default WordPress theme used on the Island Travel 
site, the description is displayed on the page that’s created by using the Post URL button described in 
the Linking Images section below. Even if your theme doesn’t currently make use of descriptions, you 
might want them later if you customize WordPress, so if you have time, enter a description when you 
upload/insert the image.
Linking Images
The address placed in the Link URL ﬁ eld, shown in Figure 13-3 is used to automatically create a link for 
your image. For instance, you might want to link an image of a product to a page on your site with more 
details or to a manufacturer’s website.
Figure 13-3
WordPress also offers a couple of automated buttons for creating links. File URL links to a blank 
browser window displaying the full-size version of the image, and Post URL displays the image in the 
size you set, on a web page that typically looks the way one of your posts would look. Some themes 
come with a template ﬁ le that displays images in a special way or you can have one made. 

100
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Why is there a None button for the Link URL? WordPress remembers how you conﬁ gured the last image, 
and if you chose a link option, it does the same again for the new image. If you don’t want any link, just 
click None.
Choosing an Alignment
I’ve already spoken brieﬂ y about choosing alignment options, but Figure 13-4 provides a quick 
reminder of what they look like.
Figure 13-4
This setting tells WordPress how to place your image relative to the text and other images on the page. 
The Left and Right options place the image to one side of the text and the text ﬂ ows around the image. 
The Center option places the image in the center of the screen with text above and below it. Selecting 
None also breaks up text above and below the image, but the image sits over on the left (the default 
position in HTML).
As with Link URL, WordPress remembers the last way you aligned an image and repeats that setting. 
So always check this option and don’t take for granted that it will default to None.
Choosing an alignment option does not do the actual aligning — it assigns a class to the image. Your 
theme’s style sheet must have those classes set up or else the alignment won’t occur in the published 
version of the post. Most themes do have these CSS styles, but it’s something to be aware of, especially 
when modifying or creating a theme.
Choosing a Size
You’re given a choice of one or more sizes for the image you’re going to insert, with the pixel size shown 
in brackets. Not all sizes will be available for all images, as shown in Figure 13-5. The choices depend 
on how large the original was. Keep in mind that the available sizes represent physically resized copies 
of your original.

101
Lesson 13: Image Options in Detail
When you upload an image, WordPress automatically creates other versions of it, depending on how 
large the original is and depending on what values are in Settings ➪ Media (I look at those settings in 
Lesson 19). By default, WordPress creates Thumbnails of 150 pixels, Medium images of 300 pixels, and 
Large images of 1024 pixels.
Figure 13-5
Based on those settings, if your image is 800 pixels wide, you’ll have a choice of Thumbnail, Medium, 
and Full-Size. If you upload an image of 125 pixels, you would only have the choice of Full-Size. If a siz-
ing option is not available it won’t have any dimensions listed below it and you won’t be able to choose 
it, as in the case of Figure 13-5 where there is no choice for Large.
How Large Do Images Need to Be?
Before leaving this discussion of sizing, it’s important to say something about the size 
of images you upload to your site. As the average digital camera offers increasingly 
larger pixel sizes, I see clients uploading image ﬁ les from which you could print a 
poster! Though it’s possible your image might be rejected by WordPress for exceeding 
the server upload settings, there’s still no need, in the vast majority of cases, to upload 
a 2MB or even a 500K image ﬁ le.
Unless you intend visitors to be able to download print-quality photos (for example, 
on a media page where magazines and newspapers would download material for 
print), you should be keeping the ﬁ les you upload as small as possible. That does not 
mean you can’t display huge photos on the Web; you just need to understand how 
even a small ﬁ le will produce gigantic web images — an image of just 100K could ﬁ ll 
your entire screen.
This is not the place to discuss the details of ﬁ le compression for the Web. The sim-
plest answer is to think in terms of pixels. In your image editing program, check 
the longest side of the image — if it’s more than 1600 pixels, reduce it to at most 1600 
before uploading. Even 800 pixels is probably more than enough for most situations.
Currently the average screen is 1024 pixels wide, so 800 would ﬁ ll the majority of the 
screen. It’s true that WordPress creates small versions for you to use in your posts, but 
you don’t want people waiting for long downloads when they click to view the full-size 
image, and you also don’t want to be using up valuable storage space on your server.

102
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Insert vs. Save
These two buttons, shown in Figure 13-6, can sometimes cause confusion.
Figure 13-6
Insert Into Post
Clicking this button places the image into the text at whatever point the cursor currently sits. Don’t 
worry if the image doesn’t end up in the right place; as you'll see in Lesson 14, it’s easy to move. In addi-
tion to inserting the image, this button simultaneously saves all the text you entered and the options 
you chose.
Sometimes people look at the Save All Changes button at the very bottom of the popup window and 
see the word Save, but clicking that does not put the image into the text of the post. You must click 
Insert Post. 
Save All Changes
The word Changes might be a bit confusing if this is the ﬁ rst time you’re uploading this image; you’re 
not changing existing information. More to the point, though, if Save All Changes doesn’t insert the 
image into the post, why use it? Why else would I be uploading an image if not to insert it?
Suppose you’ve already inserted an image gallery in the post — like the one for the Jamaican travel 
package. You want the thumbnail of this new picture to appear with the others, but nowhere else in the 
post. If you use Insert Into Post, the image will show up in the body of the text as well as in the image 
gallery. Using the Save All Changes feature, it will only show up in the image gallery.
If it turns out you want to get rid of the image — erase it from WordPress completely — there is a Delete 
function. A new line will appear warning you that you’re about to delete the image, with a Continue link 
and a Cancel link. As a further warning, the Continue button turns red as you’re about to click it. Don’t 
say you weren’t warned.

Editing and Laying Out Images
Having inserted an image into a post you may need to make some changes once you see the 
image in relationship to the text and other images. You’ll want a layout that’s pleasing to the eye 
and easy for your visitors to read. WordPress provides a number of options for editing images 
within the body of the post. How you choose to layout the page is up to you, but in this lesson I 
go over some ideas to help get you started.
Align and Resize — An Overview
Two of the most common tasks you’ll do when editing images are aligning and resizing, so let’s take 
a quick look at them. I’ve started a page for biographies of the Island Travel staff, including their pho-
tos. As you can see in Figure 14-1, the image doesn’t look all that great in relationship to the text. 
Figure 14-1

106
Part IV: Working with Media Content
An easy way to improve this layout would be to move the image over to the right-hand side of the page 
and let the text ﬂ ow around it. In other words, you need to change the alignment of the image relative 
to the text. Here’s how.
Just click the image and you’ll see several things — a set of two buttons at the top left and a number of 
squares around the edges of the image, called drag points, as shown in Figure 14-2. 
Figure 14-2
Unfortunately, Safari users will not see any drag points. As of this date, the browser has not implemented the 
creation of the resize box. See http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=15126.
Click the left-hand button — the one that looks like a little picture — and up pops the editing options 
window as shown in Figure 14-3. 
There’s a lot going on in this window — I go over it in detail later — but for now, ﬁ nd the Alignment 
options. Choose Right, and then click Update at the bottom left. As you can see in Figure 14-4, the photo 
is now over at the right side of the editor and the text ﬂ ows around it. 
With the photo aligned the way you want, it’s obviously a bit big for that spot, so let’s resize it. If your 
image isn’t showing the drag points, just click it again. Place your cursor over any of the corner squares, 
and when the cursor looks like Figure 14-5 you can click and drag.
Drag the image inward until you get the size you want and let the cursor go. Remember to update your 
post. The ﬁ nished version, shown in Figure 14-6, looks much better.

107
Lesson 14: Editing and Laying Out Images

Figure 14-4

108
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 14-5 
Figure 14-6
That’s a quick overview of the basic tools needed for editing and laying out an image in a post. Let’s go 
back now and look at all the possibilities in some detail.
The Popup Image Editor
To access the popup image editor you need to click an image so that you get a set of drag points around 
the edges and two icons at the top right. Before clicking the left-hand icon and popping up the editor, 
let me say something about the other icon — the red circle with a slash shown in Figure 14-7.
Figure 14-7
You probably guessed that it’s for deleting the image, but only from the body of the post. Clicking this 
icon does not delete the image from the post’s gallery. If you want to physically remove the image from 
WordPress, you’ll need to go into the gallery or the media library and delete it from there.

109
Lesson 14: Editing and Laying Out Images
Getting back to the left-hand icon — the one that looks like a picture — as you saw before, clicking it 
pops up the image editor. At ﬁ rst glance the window shown in Figure 14-8 looks quite different from 
the window used to upload and insert an image, but it performs virtually all the same functions.
Figure 14-8
There’s a WYSIWYG area at the top of the window that displays the alignment of the image to the sur-
rounding text. When you choose one of the alignment buttons the little graphic changes to show the new 
alignment of the image relative to the text. You can’t move the actual location of the image within the text 
using this popup window — I show you how to do that a bit later.
On the left-hand side of the fake text you’ll see a column of percentages; this is where you can alter 
the size of the image. Remember how WordPress makes different sized copies of an image when you 
upload it? The sizing we’re talking about here is not about choosing one of those copies; this is resizing 
the version you chose to insert. In other words, if you chose the medium-sized image at, say, 300 pixels, 
the sizing function in this window allows you to shrink that image to less than 300 pixels. 
The sizing scale works by moving your cursor up and down the numbers, and as you mouse over a value, the 
image adjusts to that sizing. However, you need to actually click the number in order for the image to stay resized. If 
you’re sure that’s the size you want, you then must click Update at the bottom to apply the sizing change.
This is another example of something appearing to have been changed, but the change 
doesn’t really take effect until you hit Update or Save. That’s why it’s so important to 
get in the habit of clicking Save or Update before you leave a window or a screen.

110
Part IV: Working with Media Content
You might wonder why the sliding scale includes values larger than 100%. After all, increasing an image 
beyond its original size makes it look pixilated and rough. The answer is that on this scale 100% does 
not mean original size — it’s relative to the current size settings. You’ll see what I mean if you click, say, 
70% and then update the image. Now go back into edit mode for that image and you’ll see that numbers 
beyond 100% are no longer grayed out. That’s because the current size setting for the image is less than 
its actual size, so you’re able to go beyond 100% of the current size setting.
In addition to the alignment and sizing, the popup editing window allows you to change all the other 
parameters of the image, like the title, caption, link, and so on. Again, always remember to click Update 
when you’ve done anything to change those boxes.
At the top of this window you’ll see another tab called Advanced Settings as shown in Figure 14-9. 
Figure 14-9
For the average user, you’re not going to need anything on this screen. More importantly, it’s best to 
leave this tab alone because some things on this screen could cause problems if you don’t know what 
you’re doing — like altering the source information.
On the other hand, if you’re comfortable with CSS some powerful styling tools are available on this 
screen, such as adding your own classes or ids. 
Moving and Resizing in the Text Editor
The WordPress Text Editor allows you to move an image around the screen in real time — you can see 
it changing position relative to the text as you move. This greatly speeds up the process of achieving the 
layout you want on the page. It’s also helpful because you don’t always know exactly where you want 
an image to appear when you’re doing the upload and insert process.
When working on image layout in the text editor I would recommend giving your-
self roughly the same width in the Text Editor that you have in the content area of 
your website. That way, your layout decisions will be fairly close to the real deal.
To re-create the width of your site’s content area, use the Full Screen button that you learned about in 
Lesson 7. The difference now is that once the editor takes up the entire screen, shrink your browser 
window to a width that closely matches your website content area.
To move the image in the body of the post, simply click it and drag around the screen. As you drag, the 
text cursor moves with the mouse, showing you where the image will be dropped into the text if you 

111
Lesson 14: Editing and Laying Out Images
let go of the mouse button. On some browsers on some systems, a semi-transparent copy of the image 
moves with the cursor. While you can see the text underneath, spotting that cursor through the image 
and among all the text isn’t easy. The trick is to watch the tip of your cursor arrow, as highlighted in 
Figure 14-10.
Figure 14-10
Even if you can’t see it clearly, there’s a bar moving around the text and it’s located right at the tip of the 
cursor arrow. That’s how you can precisely place your image.
As you move the image around, it aligns itself to the text according to whatever alignment setting you 
chose. If you don’t like the alignment, just click the image, click the picture icon, and edit the alignment 
in the popup window. Click Update to save your changes and exit the popup.
Once you’ve placed your image exactly where you want it, remember to Save or Update your post. 
If you have a caption for your image, it will not move with the image. What you need 
to do in that case is to delete the image from the body of the post, then place your cur-
sor at the exact point where you want to move the image, and do a new insert from 
the gallery. Remember to copy the caption for your image before deleting, so you can 
paste it back in during the insertion process.
I showed you earlier how to alter the size of images in the popup editing window using a percentage 
scale, but I think that function is better handled while working in the body of the post, and WordPress 
makes that very easy.
Click the image again so that you can see the drag points. Mouse over one of the corner drag points 
until you see that special arrow I showed you earlier. It’s important to use the corner drag points 
because they will adjust the height and the width of the image proportionately. Using the side drag 
points means you’ll be changing just the height or just the width.
Users with Internet Explorer 7 or 8 will ﬁ nd that the corner drag points do not produce proportionate 
sizing. If you’re careful and drag a corner at a 45-degree angle, you’ll get close to a proportionate sizing. 
If it doesn’t work see the following note about image sizing in the Advanced Settings window. 

112
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Aside from the fact that you have continuous sizing available with this method (compared with the 
percentage change in the popup edit window), some browsers, like Firefox, also display a small gray 
popup box showing the actual dimensions of the image in real time, as seen in Figure 14-11. 
Figure 14-11
So as you drag the corner to make the image smaller, you see the dimensions changing in the box. This 
allows you to be very precise if you want to make several images the same size or you have particular 
size restrictions in your layout.
If you need that precision and don’t see the popup dimensions, you can click Edit on the image, go into 
Advanced Settings on the popup window, and enter a speciﬁ c height and width.
If you need to get your image back to its original size, all you need to do is click 
the image edit icon, choose the Advanced Settings, and you’ll see a button called 
Original Size. That will return the image to its full size — that is, the size of the 
image you inserted.
As always, when you’ve ﬁ nished resizing, be sure to click Update Post.
More Complex Image Layouts
The example of a staff photo aligned to the right of the person’s bio was a nice straightforward layout. 
But what if you’re doing a post about the latest travel convention you attended, with several paragraphs 
of text and six images to be placed throughout? What are your layout options then?
You could do it in a number of ways — especially when you start working with templates in the 
advanced section of the book — but the best advice at any level is to not worry about getting fancy. 
One straightforward layout technique is to alternate image alignment left and right, like I’ve done in 
Figure 14-12.
Remember that, although HTML defaults to aligning images to the left, it’s not the type of alignment 
that will let text ﬂ ow around it. You must choose Alignment Left in the image’s edit window.

113
Lesson 14: Editing and Laying Out Images
Figure 14-12
One of the problems you can run into with this technique is that if two images are too large or not 
vertically separated enough, their left and right alignments will cause some strange consequences, as 
you can see in Figure 14-13. Other problems include having a column of single word text between the 
images, or if the images are really wide, one forces the other to drop below it with large white gaps in 
between.
This is where the ability to resize images right on the screen comes in handy. You can reduce the size 
and see what effect it’s having on all the other elements on the page. Remember to make your Text 
Editor about the same width as your live content area or you won’t get an accurate picture of how the 
images are interacting with the text and one another.
If you don’t want to make one or more of the images smaller, you can drag the lower image further 
down the text — well below the bottom of the higher image — to give a more readable result. You 
always have a number of ways to lay out your content. You just need to try different combinations and 
see what works best.

114
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 14-13
When you think you have everything placed the way you want it, be sure to click Preview Changes to 
see what your layout will look like live. If everything’s good, remember to Save or Update the post.
Updating an Image
A common task when updating websites is to replace images, either with a new version or with a com-
pletely new image. Often this is done simply by uploading the new image with an FTP program and 
because it’s been given the same ﬁ lename, the new image just overwrites the old. There’s no need to 
change the HTML because the name of the image ﬁ le remains the same.
Though it would be possible to do the same in WordPress, it’s far simpler to delete the old image and 
upload and insert the new. Because WordPress creates separate resized versions of an image, you would 
run into problems if you simply uploaded a new image of the same name using your FTP program. The 
thumbnail used in the gallery and media library wouldn’t match the actual image. Similarly, if your 
image is linked to the full-size version, the two wouldn’t match.
You could take the time to create all the necessary versions of the image, make sure they’re named 
exactly right, and then upload them, but there are so many possibilities for error, it just makes more 
sense to delete the old and upload a new image.

115

Working with Image Galleries
You’ve seen how WordPress makes it easy to upload and insert images into your posts, but what if 
you have a lot of images for a single post, say, the pictures for that Jamaican travel package. It would 
be nice to just show thumbnails of each picture and then have people click them to see the larger ver-
sion. WordPress lets you insert an image gallery into your posts with just the click of a button. 
The term gallery can be a little confusing. What we’re talking about is the built-in gallery 
system that comes with WordPress. Don’t mistake it for the many gallery plugins available to 
add on to WordPress. On top of that, while the gallery for a post is a list of all media that were 
uploaded through that post, the gallery you insert into a post only displays the image ﬁ les. Still 
with me?
To avoid confusion, I’ll use the term image gallery to refer to the set of thumbnails that appear in the 
post, as opposed to the gallery tab that’s part of the upload/insert popup window.
Creating an Image Gallery in a Post
Start by going to the Upload/Insert menu and clicking the image icon. If you’re inserting a image 
gallery I’m assuming you have more than one image uploaded, so you’ll see a Gallery tab with the 
number of ﬁ les in the gallery listed in brackets (that total, remember, is all media, not just images).
Click the Gallery tab and as in Figure 15-1 you’ll see all your images with thumbnails and the 
Show link.
Below the list of media ﬁ les you’ll see the Gallery Settings title.
If you have other types of media ﬁ les in the gallery, don’t worry. WordPress automatically uses 
only the image ﬁ les when inserting an image gallery.

118
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 15-1
If you have a lot of ﬁ les you’ll need to scroll down to see the entire Gallery Settings options, which are 
shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2
Let’s go through each of those options in the order you see them.
Link Thumbnails To
You can choose where visitors are taken when they click a gallery’s thumbnails. Choosing Image File 
causes a new tab or window to open and the full-size version of the image will be displayed on a blank 
page. If you choose Attachment Page, the image will link to a page determined by your theme. In most 
cases this defaults to the theme’s standard post page.

119
Lesson 15: Working with Image Galleries
Order Images By
The four choices are Menu Order, Title, Date/Time, and Random. Random was added in WordPress 2.8 
and it functions by randomizing the order of the gallery each time a visitor loads the post in his or her 
browser. The Title is the option I talked about in Lesson 13 — remember that unless you give the image 
a title, WordPress automatically uses the ﬁ lename of the image. Date/Time is the date and time you 
uploaded the ﬁ le. Even if you did a multiﬁ le upload, the time stamp would be different on each by a 
few milliseconds, so they would be in the order you uploaded them.
The default choice is Menu Order, which means the order of the images as you see them in this win-
dow. I come back to the methods for changing the menu order in a later section of this lesson.
Order
Based on the Order method you just chose, you make that order either Ascending or Descending. 
Ascending is the default.
If you’re using Menu Order, and you set a speciﬁ c menu order through the methods shown in the ﬁ nal sec-
tion of this lesson, these two buttons have no effect, unless you clear the menu order from the listings.
Gallery Columns
This sets the number of columns across the page — the default is 3, which is pretty safe for most sites 
based on the default thumbnail size of 150 pixels. If you try 5 or more columns across, it will probably 
be too wide for the area of your post.
For this Jamaica gallery, I’m going to choose the following options:
Link image to Image File
 
❑
Order by Date
 
❑
Descending Order (ordering by the Date and using Descending order means that any new 
 
❑
images I add later will automatically show at the beginning of the group)
Gallery Columns — 3
 
❑
Once these are set, I click the Insert Gallery button at the bottom of the screen and the image gallery 
appears in the post wherever I placed my cursor, as shown in Figure 15-3.
That large orange box with the camera in the center is the placeholder for the image gallery. You’ll see 
the images on the live page, as in Figure 15-4, but only after clicking Update Post!
If I had written a caption for one or more of the images, they would appear below their respective 
thumbnails. There’s no further control over captions appearing in the image gallery — if you enter a 
caption it will appear.

Lesson 15: Working with Image Galleries
Adding and Removing Images from a Gallery
Once you’ve inserted an image gallery into your post, you can easily add or remove images and it will 
automatically update itself. But there are a few things to be aware of. 
Any image you upload to a post in the future will automatically appear as part of its image gallery. I’ve talked 
before about the fact that uploading a media ﬁ le to a post does not mean it will appear in the post — you 
must actually insert it. This is an exception that rule. An image gallery will display any image that’s been 
uploaded to the post, regardless of whether it was individually inserted into the post. 
The only way to remove an image from an image gallery is to completely delete it from WordPress. If an image 
appears both in the post and as part of the image gallery, deleting it from the body of the post will not 
remove it from the image gallery (that follows from the preceding point). If you’ve created a particu-
lar order for the images in the gallery by numbering them (see the next section), simply deleting the 
image’s number from that order will not remove it from the image gallery.
If you still want to be able to use an image that you want removed from an image gallery, you’re going to 
have to delete it from WordPress and then upload it again, either into another post or into the media library. 
Changing the Order or Size of Gallery Images
The default order of images in an image gallery is the order in which they appear in the gallery tab, but 
you have a number of ways to change that order.
The easiest I ﬁ nd is to drag and drop the thumbnails into the order you want. Place your cursor over 
the thumbnail you want to move, then click and drag. Onscreen you see the thumbnail move with your 
cursor, as shown in Figure 15-5. 
Figure 15-5

122
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Once the thumbnail is in place, let go of your mouse button. The list has been reordered, as you can see 
in Figure 15-6.
Figure 15-6
Remember to click Save All Changes or else this reordering will not take effect.
Clicking Update Gallery Settings does not save any reordering of the menu — you must click Save All Changes.
You’ll notice in Figure 15-6 that under the Order column numbers are now listed in each box. This is 
another way you can rearrange the order of items: changing the numbers in the order boxes.
Even though all ﬁ le types will have a number beside them, and you can move them around in all the 
ways described here, only images will appear in the image gallery.
If you change item 4 to item 2, and then click Save All Changes, item 4 will move into the second spot.
The change may not happen this way in all browsers. On Firefox for Mac, the item 
moves to the new position, but you end up with two number 2’s. You need to click 
Ascending or Descending to correct the numbering.
In addition to changing the order of images in your image gallery, you can also change the size of the 
images as they appear in the post. The default, of course, is the thumbnail version of the image. To use 
the medium version, you’ll need to use what’s called the gallery shortcode. Figure 15-7 compares the 
image gallery as it looks in Visual and HTML modes.

123
Lesson 15: Working with Image Galleries
The code [gallery] is all that’s needed to create the image gallery — the additional parts of the code 
are the options I chose for ordering the images, and so on. One option that is not included in General 
Settings, but which you can implement with this shortcode, is sizing. By adding the following: [gallery  
size=”medium”], the images in the gallery will no longer be thumbnails — WordPress will use the 
medium-sized images it created for you. The other choices are “large” and “full,” but it’s unlikely you’d 
ever want to use those.
Figure 15-7
You can use some other gallery shortcodes in HTML mode, one of which I show you in the next sec-
tion. You can ﬁ nd more about them in the WordPress documentation at this address: http://codex 
.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode.
Using Galleries from Other Posts
Sometimes a gallery of photos you’ve created in one post would be handy to have in another post as 
well. WordPress makes it easy to do that, using the shortcodes technique I showed you in the preceding 
section. For this to work, though, you need to know the ID number for the post that has the gallery you 
want (I show you how to do that in Lesson 18).
Once you have that ID, ﬁ nd the place where you want to insert the gallery and enter it as you see in 
Figure 15-8 (you can do this in Visual or HTML mode).
Of course you’d replace the ID number with the one you want.
If you want to add more image galleries to the post, just keep entering the code in Figure 15-8 with the 
proper ID. By the way, this only became possible in WordPress 2.8, so if you want multiple image galler-
ies in a single post you’ll need to upgrade.

Adding Video and Audio
The popularity of video on the Internet has exploded over the past few years as technical barriers 
to displaying video have fallen one by one. WordPress offers a number of built-in options for put-
ting video on your website, and in this lesson I help you sort through them, as well as the options 
for audo ﬁ les.
For the greatest ﬂ exibility and ease of handling video ﬁ les, particularly if you’re going to have a lot 
of video on your site, I would recommend using one of the many WordPress plugins for video, and 
you can read about those in Lesson 37. If you’re just going to have the occasional video, the choices 
offered in this lesson should be adequate.
The ﬁ rst decision you’ll need to make when putting video on your site is whether to have a simple 
link or to actually have the video playing within your web page. In the course of showing you how 
each is done, I’ll cover the second decision, which is whether to store your own video ﬁ les on your 
server or on a video-sharing site like YouTube.
Uploading/Inserting Video
If you just need a link to a video, you would use the second icon from the left on the Upload/Insert 
menu. Clicking it brings up a window that looks exactly like the one for images. The From Computer 
tab is always the default so we’ll begin with that.
Click the Select Files button and in the popup window locate your video ﬁ le on your computer. 
When you’re done, click Select and the ﬁ le begins to upload, with the regular progress bar. Video 
ﬁ les can be quite large, so the upload could take a while.
Servers vary on the ﬁ le size limit for uploading and although WordPress attempts 
to set that limit at 64MB, it does not always work, so depending on your server, you 
might get an uploading error. You could try getting your host to raise the limit or 
you can try resaving the video at a smaller size or different compression to reduce 
its size. Or, make the video shorter.

128
Part IV: Working with Media Content
When the upload is complete, the popup window changes to look as shown in Figure 16-1.
Figure 16-1
It looks similar to the images window, but without options like alignment or sizing (WordPress doesn’t 
make different sized copies of videos). You can enter a title, caption, and description; at the very least 
you need to enter a title because that’s the text for the link that appears in your post.
You also need to click File URL or else there won’t be any link to the video, just the words of the title, 
and the whole point of this is to allow visitors to click and see the video.
So what happens when visitors click the link? That all depends on the type of video ﬁ le you uploaded 
and how their browser is set to deal with that type, but in the case of a Flash ﬁ le, for example, the link 
should open a new browser window and start playing the video at the size of the browser screen.
This is the ﬁ rst difﬁ culty with the Upload/Insert method when dealing with video ﬁ les: because many 
different video standards exist and a plain link puts everything in the hands of your visitors’ browser/
computer, you’re really leaving it to chance whether or not they can view your video.
You’ll run into the same difﬁ culty using the From URL tab and pointing to a video ﬁ le somewhere 
else on the Web, unless you’re pointing to a video on a sharing site like YouTube, where videos are 
contained in standalone players that will work in virtually anyone’s browser. Though this may solve 
the ﬁ rst difﬁ culty, it raises the second difﬁ culty of the Upload/Insert method, which is that you’re 
taking visitors away from your page in order to view a video.
The answer to both these problems lies in using the Embed Media button on your Visual Text Editor.
The Embed Media Button
Embedding just means having HTML code that allows visitors to view a video without leaving the 
page, and WordPress handles all of that for you with the Embed Media button. Clicking it produces the 
popup window shown in Figure 16-2.

129
Lesson 16: Adding Video and Audio
Figure 16-2
Let’s go through all the options.
Type
You can choose from different ﬁ le types, but because we’re dealing with video here, there really is only 
one choice most people will need to make and that’s Flash. It’s become the default standard on the 
Internet and, more importantly, it’s what most video-sharing sites like YouTube use.
File/URL
If you have your own video that you’ve saved as an SWF Flash ﬁ le, you would ﬁ rst upload it to the 
WordPress media library and then get the URL and paste it here. Or if the video is from a sharing site 
like YouTube, you would copy the URL and paste it here.
Unless you have only one video ﬁ le and you don’t want many people to see it (why are 
you putting it on your website?), I would recommend getting an account on a video-
sharing site and uploading your video ﬁ les there, then paste their URLs into WordPress.
For one thing, video-sharing sites do the automatic conversion to Flash of whatever 
kind of ﬁ le you have. Then there’s the question of server space and bandwidth — they 
have lots and you not so much. Finally, your video has a chance of being seen by even 
more people and you can link back to your own website for more exposure. Is there any 
other way to video? 
One thing, though: make sure your video has clear identiﬁ cation on it — you want to 
share with it others, but you also want them to know where it came from and what your 
website address is!

130
Part IV: Working with Media Content
When you’ve entered a URL, click anywhere in the Preview pane and after a brief loading, you should 
see the video displayed in the pane and the Dimensions boxes automatically ﬁ lled in, as shown in 
Figure 16-3.
Figure 16-3
If the URL is not from a video-sharing site, which usually makes it clear whether or 
not you have permission to embed a video, you need to get permission.
Dimensions
Most videos from sharing sites like YouTube will already be displayed in a good size for most purposes, 
but you can change the sizing in the boxes provided. 
Be sure the Constrain Proportions box is checked before you enter a value (if you forget, just click 
Cancel and start again; trying to constrain proportions after you’ve changed one value is too frustrat-
ing). After giving width or height a value, click the Preview panel or press your Tab key and after a 
short time you should see a resized version of the video.
There is an Advanced tab in this window, but for most purposes it’s not needed, particularly if you’re 
embedding videos from a sharing site.
Finally, you can click the Insert button and you’ll see a large orange box in your post just like you 
see when you insert an image gallery. This is a placeholder for the video and you can move it around 
to place it exactly where you’d like and you can also click and use the drag points to change the 
dimensions. 

131
Lesson 16: Adding Video and Audio
Remember to click Update Post and then you can preview the post, as in Figure 16-4, to see how the 
embedded video looks.
Figure 16-4
If the video is one that you’ve uploaded (assuming you had saved or converted your ﬁ le to Flash), you’ll 
notice that you have no video controls. That’s because you’re embedding a straight ﬁ le, with no video 
player built in. This is yet another reason for uploading your videos to a video-sharing site ﬁ rst and 
then embedding it in your site. Or, as I mentioned before, you can use a WordPress plugin for videos, 
many of which provide the necessary player.
Final Notes About Embedding Video
Embedding a media ﬁ le from an external URL does not place anything in the post’s gallery list 
 
❑
or in the media library. 
If you want to align your video, there is no simple way to do it through the visual editor — even 
 
❑
the align feature in Advanced Settings is not reliable. And most of the time you want the video 
to be as large as possible, which wouldn’t leave any room for text to ﬂ ow around it anyway.
If you want to edit the settings of a video you’ve already embedded, just click the orange box 
 
❑
in the Text Editor to select it, and you’ll see the Embed Media button gray out. Click the Embed 
button and the edit window will pop up.
If you’re comfortable working in HTML mode of the Text Editor, you can also embed a video 
 
❑
from a sharing site by simply copying the embed code it provides (it should be displayed very 
near where the URL is provided) and pasting it into your post, as shown in Figure 16-5.

132
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 16-5
Adding Audio
What’s been said about video ﬁ les largely applies to audio as well. The Upload/Insert functions — From 
Computer and From URL — really just create links to ﬁ les that you’ve either uploaded to WordPress or 
which reside somewhere on the Web.
The real difference comes when you’re using the Embed Media button I recommended for video. 
Although audio-sharing sites exist, such as Soundboard, they’re not as familiar to us as video-sharing 
sites, but the same idea applies: you upload your audio ﬁ les to their site and then embed the coding in 
your WordPress site. Audio ﬁ les may not be as large as video ﬁ les or as diverse in their ﬁ le types, but 
the problems of server space and of visitors consistently being able to listen to the audio are still there. 
The audio-sharing site takes care of both issues.
Type
If you know that the audio is already embedded in Flash, that’s ﬁ ne, but what if you just have a link to 
an MP3 ﬁ le? You’ll need to experiment with which Type to choose from the drop-down list. I’ve had 
success with the QuickTime setting using MP3s, but it will depend on the ﬁ le type.
Dimensions
Even though we’re dealing with audio ﬁ les, there is a visual component that requires dimensions: the 
audio player visitors have on their system. You’ll need to experiment with the dimensions for the audio 

133
Lesson 16: Adding Video and Audio
player. The system defaults to a square even though the audio player is usually long and narrow, with 
the result that you’ll have lots of white space at the top and bottom of the player when you see it on the 
site. All you need to do is play with the height value until you get rid of that white space (don’t turn on 
Constrain Proportions or the width will be changed too).
As you can see, the built-in methods for using video and audio in WordPress are pretty basic and they 
work just ﬁ ne for putting up the occasional video of your presentation to a conference or audio of an 
interview you did for a blog. If you need to work a lot with these two media (if you’re thinking of start-
ing a podcast, for instance), many excellent WordPress plugins are available that give you far more con-
trol over organizing and displaying video and audio ﬁ les. I cover some of those in Lesson 37.

Adding Documents
It’s often easier to make information available to visitors in the form of documents rather than 
trying to re-create the information on a web page. Plus, they have something to “take away” with 
all your contact information on it as well. So being able to upload and link to documents easily is 
important, and WordPress has that covered. 
In this lesson I'm talking about the Add Media button of the Upload/Insert menu.  While it can 
be used to upload any allowed media type other than images, video, and audio, it is most com-
monly used for documents.
Uploading and Inserting a Document
Unlike the case of video and audio, using the Upload/Insert function for documents is perfectly 
ﬁ ne. In fact, the method is well suited to documents because having a simple link is exactly what 
you want. When someone clicks the link it causes the ﬁ le to be downloaded, or in the case of 
PDFs, it will automatically appear in the most people’s browsers.
I’ve created a Press Releases category in WordPress and I’ve created a post for a press release, so 
now I’m going to add the PDF of the press release. I begin by placing my cursor where I want the 
link to appear in my text. Then I click the document icon of the Upload/Insert menu and get the 
usual popup window tabs: From Computer, From URL, Gallery, and Media Library. 
In this case I’m adding the PDF from my computer, so I go through the steps of selecting the ﬁ le and 
clicking Upload, and when the upload is complete I get the options screen shown in Figure 17-1.
The Title will be what shows as the link text in the body of the post. You can of course change the 
link text later in the Text Editor, but it’s always a bit faster to do it from here.
The only other thing to watch for when adding a document from your computer is to be sure the 
ﬁ le’s URL is showing properly in the Link area, as highlighted in Figure 17-2.

136
Part IV: Working with Media Content
Figure 17-1
Figure 17-2
If not, just click File URL to insert it. Without that URL your visitors won’t be able to view or download 
the document.
Then I click the Insert Into Post button and the link shows up in the post as illustrated in Figure 17-3. 
If you see the Title text in your post but no link, don’t worry, it just means you forgot to make sure that 
the Link URL box was ﬁ lled in. Without that, WordPress won’t create a link. 
To ﬁ x things, just erase the text that was inserted and go back to the document link of the Upload/Insert 
menu. Go to the Gallery tab in the popup window, ﬁ nd your document, click Show, and under Link 
URL, click File URL, click Insert, and the link should now appear in your post.
Once you’ve inserted a document link in your post, you can move it around by cutting and pasting it, 
but it’s always easiest to have positioned your cursor in the exact spot where you want the link before 
doing the upload and insert.
Finally, remember to update your post and the link is ready for your visitors to use.
What Types of Documents to Upload
You can upload all sorts of document ﬁ les into WordPress, such as PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, 
Word documents, spreadsheets, and so on, but you should always be guided by the needs of your visi-
tors. They want material to be accessible and safe.

137
Lesson 17: Adding Documents
Figure 17-3
Do visitors have the program to open the ﬁ le and is their version capable of reading the document? 
My preference is to always post documents as PDFs where possible. Virtually everyone can open them 
and most importantly they don’t contain some of the hidden surprises that can be in other documents, 
such as names of other authors or collaborators, erased text, or pieces of other documents, not to men-
tion viruses. 
Updating a Document
In many cases you’ll want to update an existing document that you’ve inserted into a post. You can do 
this in a couple of ways depending on your comfort level with using FTP programs.
The fastest way to update a document is to use an FTP program. Unlike the case of images, WordPress 
does not create different versions of a document ﬁ le, so there is only one that needs to be replaced, and 
the simplest way to do that is with a ﬁ le transfer program.
 1. 
Make a note of the ﬁ le’s name and location by checking the link in the body of your post. The 
exact location will depend on what pathways you’ve set up, but by default, WordPress puts all 
uploaded ﬁ les into wp-content/uploads and typically organizes them by month and year, 
though you may have customized that as well.
 2. 
Name the new version of the ﬁ le exactly the same as the old.
3. 
Open your FTP program and log into your server. Navigate to the location of the new ﬁ le on 
your computer (usually the left side of the screen) and to the old ﬁ le on the server.
 4. 
Highlight the new ﬁ le and click the upload button. The new ﬁ le will overwrite the old version. 
To verify, you can check the date of the ﬁ le on the server and it should now say “today.”

138
Part IV: Working with Media Content
If you’re not comfortable with FTP, you can also update the document in WordPress, but the only way 
to do it is to completely delete the old one. If you simply try to upload the new ﬁ le through WordPress, 
it will create a new ﬁ lename with the number 1 on the end and the link in your post will continue to 
point to the old ﬁ le. 
 1. 
Find the post where you inserted the original document, and erase the text link for that docu-
ment. Leave your cursor in that spot.
 2. 
Click the document icon on the Upload/Insert menu.
 3. 
Click the Gallery tab and locate the document.
 4. 
Click Show and then delete the document.
 5. 
Click the From Computer tab, then browse for the new version of the document on your com-
puter and upload.
 6. 
When the upload is complete, in the Title ﬁ eld enter the text that you want to appear in the link.
 7. 
Click File URL to make sure the link goes to the document.
 
8 
Click Insert into post and you should see the new link appear in your post.
If you’ve used the same document elsewhere on your site, you’ll need to update those links as well. This 
process is a little easier.
 1. 
Place your cursor on the new link you just created.
 2. 
Click the link button on the top button bar of the Text Editor (it should be highlighted).
 3. 
Copy the URL from the popup box.
 4. 
Wherever there’s a link to that document on your site, you can go into the post, edit the link, 
and paste in this new URL. Then all the links will reference the new document you uploaded.

Part V: Managing Your Content
Lesson 18: Managing Posts and Pages
Lesson 19: Managing Media Files
Lesson 20: Managing Post Categories and Tags
Lesson 21: Managing Widgets


Managing Posts and Pages
After you’ve been adding more and more content to your site, you’ll want faster ways to navigate 
through it and make changes faster or on a larger scale. This lesson is about ﬁ nding and editing 
content more efﬁ ciently.
On the Island Travel site, for example, I might want to add a tag to every single post that mentions 
a particular airline. If I have dozens and dozens of posts that meet that criteria, and given the tools 
you’ve seen so far, that sounds like a long process. But in this lesson you learn how to ﬁ nd posts 
and pages quickly, and then edit them all just as fast.
Finding Posts and Pages
When you want to edit your content, WordPress displays the most recent posts ﬁ rst by default. 
While you can increase the number of posts it displays at any one time, there are more efﬁ cient 
strategies for ﬁ nding material than simply scanning long lists of posts.
Finding Posts
The starting point for ﬁ nding posts is the Edit Posts link on the admin menu. You already know 
that this brings up a list of all your posts, but look closely now at the top area of the screen, shown 
in Figure 18-1. 
At the very top you see a menu with All, Published, Pending Review, and Draft. This is very helpful 
when you want to see only your Drafts, or if you have multiple users and you’re the editor, you can 
quickly ﬁ nd all the items Pending Review before being published. Keep in mind that you may not 
see all of these choices. If no posts are in review status, for example, Pending Review does not 
appear. The numbers in brackets, of course, refer to the number of posts.

144
Part V: Managing Your Content
Figure 18-1
Over on the top far right is the Search box, which looks through the title and the body of posts to ﬁ nd the 
word or phrase you enter. This search does not include categories or tags. Also, the search is performed 
on only the posts you have included through any ﬁ ltering. So if you’re viewing posts in a particular cat-
egory, the search is performed only on those posts.
If you click one of your search results, make some changes, and save the post, you cannot return to your 
search results. Prior to version 2.8 you could do that, but for some reason the feature was removed in 
2.8. You’ll need to Edit Posts and start the search again.
Just below the Search box are two icons. The one on the left produces the List View that you see by 
default. The one on the right is Excerpt View and it displays a short excerpt from each post, which is 
helpful if you can’t remember what a post was about.
On the second row of the Edit Posts search area, over on the left, is a series of drop-down menus. I’ll 
leave the Bulk Actions to a later section of this lesson and focus here on the Filter function. You can use 
two parameters for ﬁ ltering through posts:
Show All Dates:
 
❑
 This is handy when you remember posting a testimonial last April even though 
you can’t remember anything else about it. By choosing April 2008, for example, you’ll see every 
post from that month.
View All Categories:
 
❑
 This menu allows you to ﬁ lter the display results by category. This is very 
handy, for instance, when you want to see everything you’ve written on a particular topic or to 
make bulk changes to a related set of posts (I cover bulk editing later in this lesson).
Using both these ﬁ lters at once allows even more ﬁ ne-grained sorting.

Lesson 18: Managing Posts and Pages
Finding Pages
The search function for Edit Pages is more limited than for posts, as you can see in Figure 18-2. 
Figure 18-2
There are no categories for pages, and dates are not that relevant for pages, so those Filter functions are 
not available. You also don’t have the Excerpt View option. You can still ﬁ lter pages by their status — 
notice that all statuses are shown even when they’re empty — and of course you can perform a search 
for words or phrases.
Renaming, Rescheduling, 
and More with Quick Edit
You know that to edit a post you simply click its title in the list of posts and it opens up a new screen with 
the Text Editor and so on. But very often you’ll want to change a parameter of a post — title, categories, 
author, status, and so on — without needing to change anything in the body. With WordPress’s Quick 
Edit feature you can do that without having to open the entire post.
On the Edit Posts or Edit Pages screen, simply mouseover the name of the item and you’ll see the menu 
shown in Figure 18-3A. Click Quick Edit and in the case of posts you’ll see the options in Figure 18-3B, 
and for pages you’ll see what’s in Figure 18-3C.

146

Figure 18-3
You simply change the parameter(s) and click Update, at which point the list returns to normal.
Using Bulk Edit
The advantages of the Quick Edit feature are also available in a more limited form when dealing with large 
numbers of entries under Edit Posts or Edit Pages. Using the Edit function on the Bulk Actions drop-down 
menu at the top of either screen, you can change most of the parameters you saw with Quick Edit.
If you want to get rid of large numbers of posts, Delete is the other option you see on the Bulk Actions 
menu. Simply check off the items you want (or use the Select All checkbox), choose Delete, and click Apply.
Bulk-Editing Posts
These are the Edit functions you can perform on any number of posts at one time:
Assign to one or more categories
 
❑
Add one or more tags
 
❑
Change the author (if there’s more than one available)
 
❑
Allow or disallow comments
 
❑
Change the publishing status
 
❑
Allow or disallow pings
 
❑
Stick or unstick to the homepage
 
❑
Suppose I want to include all Sunstar Testimonials in the TravelWhiz Testimonials category. I’d start by ﬁ l-
tering out all the Sunstar Testimonials. If there were dozens and dozens of posts for Sunstar Testimonials, 

147
Lesson 18: Managing Posts and Pages
I could speed up the process even further by having the page display, say, 100 posts at a time, using the 
Posts Per Page setting under the Screen Options menu at the top right of the screen. When the relevant 
testimonials are displayed, I click the checkbox at the left of the header bar, which automatically selects all 
the posts. Then, from the Bulk Actions drop-down I select Edit and click Apply, producing the screen in 
Figure 18-4.
Figure 18-4
On the left side of the highlighted area is a list of all the posts I selected. Beside each is a circle with an 
X — clicking that removes the post from the edit, so there’s still time to make changes in the list of posts 
affected by the edit.
Then I locate the TravelWhiz Testimonials category from the list and check off the box. While I’m here, it 
might be a good idea to add in any possible tags. Because Sunstar only does resort packages and they’re 
now part of the TravelWhiz group of companies, I can add the tag “TravelWhiz resort packages.” Because 
this tag already exists in the system, as soon as I start to type “Trav” I get a popup window and I select 
the one I want.
When I’m ﬁ nished making all my Bulk Edit changes, I click Update Posts and I’m done. If I decide not 
to make any changes, Cancel is over on the left of the highlighted area.
Bulk-Editing Pages
Because there are no categories or tags for pages, the Bulk Edit feature on the Edit Pages screen looks a 
bit different, as you can see in Figure 18-5.

148
Part V: Managing Your Content
Figure 18-5
In the case of pages, you can:
Assign a parent page
 
❑
Assign a page template
 
❑
Change the author (if there’s more than one available)
 
❑
Allow or disallow comments
 
❑
Change the publishing status
 
❑
Allow or disallow pings
 
❑
The parent page would allow you, for example, to move a group of pages under a new parent page to 
create a new section of the website.
If you wanted that new section of the site to have a different look, you could also assign them to a spe-
ciﬁ c page template you’d created. Remember when I spoke in Lesson 1 of having thousands of pages 
use a different header? Bulk Edit, along with a customized page template, is the means for making such 
a large change as simple as possible.
Changing Your Homepage
By default, the homepage or front page in WordPress consists of the 10 most-recent posts from all cat-
egories. However, you can change that setting in a number of ways under the Settings ➪ Reading, and 
that section of screen is shown in Figure 18-6.

149
Lesson 18: Managing Posts and Pages
Figure 18-6
You can see the default setting of Your Latest Posts. The other choice is to make one of your WordPress 
pages the site’s homepage, by choosing from the drop-down menu next to Front Page.
Keep in mind that the title of whatever page you choose does not change in the menu. If you decide you 
want the About page to be your homepage, the menu will still say About. Usually what happens is that 
you create a page called Home and then choose that from the drop-down menu.
Typically, WordPress themes use only the built-in page menu generator, but some-
times they’ll hard-code in a homepage. If you change the Front Page setting, using 
a page you’ve named Home, your menu will end up with two Home pages listed. 
Removing that hard-coded Home page — probably from the header.php template 
— solves the problem. 
Though it’s clear enough what choice you’re making for Front Page, it may not be obvious what the sec-
ond drop-down — Posts Page — is for. If you think about it, when you choose one of your static pages 
for the homepage, there’s no longer a place for people to ﬁ nd all your latest blog posts in one location. 
True, they can look at individual categories, but there isn’t a “blog” page like the default homepage. 
That’s what the drop-down is for. 
In the case of a WordPress website that does not have a blog on it, like the Island Travel site, it’s not a 
problem that the front page has been replaced by a static page. In fact, it’s quite helpful because post cat-
egories in the case of Island Travel are not being used for a blog, but for organizing chunks of content.
If you do want to have a blog on your site, you can use the Posts Page drop-down menu to choose the 
page where that blog will appear.

150
Part V: Managing Your Content
If you have content on the static page you’re thinking of using for the Posts Page, it will not be dis-
played. What you need to do is create a new page with whatever title suits best — The Blog, Blog Posts, 
or whatever — and leave the Text Editor blank, then publish the page. Now, when you choose it from 
the Posts Page drop-down menu, it simply gets ﬁ lled with the latest posts.

the enclosed DVD.

Managing Media Files
You learned earlier that all media ﬁ les you upload to WordPress are listed in the Media Library. 
In this lesson I show you how to work with the library, both sorting and ﬁ nding media ﬁ les, as 
well as editing and deleting them. I also show you some administrative settings for media ﬁ les.
Finding Files in the Media Library
You’ve already seen how the Media Library works on the tabs of the Upload/Insert popup win-
dow. The Media Library screen accessed from the Media ➪ Library link of the admin menu, 
shown in Figure 19-1, is very similar. 
One important difference with this screen is that you can see whether a media ﬁ le is attached to a 
post, and if so, the name of the post with a direct link. To be attached to a post means that the ﬁ le 
is listed in that post’s gallery.
Why is it useful to know if a media ﬁ le is attached? If it’s not, you know it’s available to be used in 
a gallery, because media ﬁ les can be attached to only one post.
If a media ﬁ le is attached and you want to use it in a different post’s gallery, you have two 
options:
Delete the ﬁ le, which removes it from the ﬁ rst post’s gallery, then upload the ﬁ le into the 
 
❑
new post (you cannot simply change the post to which a media ﬁ le is attached).
Upload a second copy of the ﬁ le (WordPress automatically renames it by adding a num-
 
❑
ber so there’s no conﬂ ict with the existing copy) into the new post where you want it to 
appear.

152
Part V: Managing Your Content
Figure 19-1
Of course, if you don’t need a ﬁ le to be part of a post’s gallery — you only want to insert it into the body 
of the post — you’re free to insert media ﬁ les in as many posts as you’d like, whether or not the ﬁ le is 
attached.
If you’re looking for unattached ﬁ les, an easy way of ﬁ nding them is to use the menu at the top of the 
page just below Media Library. The links in this menu will vary depending on the types of ﬁ les in your 
library. There will always be an All link, but there can also be: Images, Video, Audio, and Unattached 
(with the total for each in brackets, except Unattached ). Clicking Unattached displays all media ﬁ les 
that are not in a post gallery.
This little menu is important because it tells you what you’re looking at in the library. If you don’t notice 
that the Images link is selected, for example, you’re left wondering why your PDFs, videos, and audios 
aren’t listed. Just click All to display every type of media ﬁ le. The currently selected choice will always 
be in bold black.
You can also ﬁ nd items in the Media Library by the date they were uploaded into WordPress. The Show 
All Dates menu at the top of the page drops down a list of available months. 
The Media Library displays ﬁ les in descending chronological order (newest ﬁ rst) and there is no option 
for changing this. However, you do have some display choices in the Screen Options tab (at the top right 
of the screen), such as which columns to show and how many ﬁ les to display per page.
The last method for ﬁ nding media ﬁ les is the Search ﬁ eld at the top right. Keep in mind that it looks for 
words and phrases only in the Title and Description ﬁ elds of media ﬁ les, and that the search is conducted 
on all media ﬁ les, regardless of which ones are currently displayed. 

153
Lesson 19: Managing Media Files
Editing and Deleting Media Files
To edit a ﬁ le in the Media Library, just click its name. Or, when you mouseover the row for that media 
ﬁ le, a text menu appears allowing you to Edit, Delete, or View the ﬁ le.
Clicking the name or the Edit link takes you to a new page, shown in Figure 19-2, where you see the ﬁ le 
and the options to edit.
Figure 19-2
There are very few options because they relate only to the ﬁ le itself. Even with ﬁ les that are attached to 
posts, you cannot edit parameters like alignment or size from this screen because you’re not editing the 
post, just the media ﬁ le. If you do need to change those other options, WordPress makes it easy by hav-
ing the link to the post right there in the Media Library.
If a media ﬁ le is attached to a post, changes made in the Media Library are reﬂ ected in the ﬁ le’s listing 
in the gallery. However, inserted copies of the ﬁ le will not be affected — their titles, captions, and so on 
are independent on a per-post basis. 
If you need to delete a media ﬁ le using the Media Library, simply mouseover the title of the ﬁ le and click 
Delete from the menu that appears. If you need to delete large numbers of ﬁ les, check the box on the left 
of the relevant ﬁ les, choose Delete from the Bulk Actions drop-down at the top or bottom of the screen, 
and click Apply.

154
Part V: Managing Your Content
If you delete a media ﬁ le that’s been inserted into a post(s), the link(s) will remain 
in place and show on the website as broken. You need to go into each post and get 
rid of the code that’s trying to ﬁ nd the deleted ﬁ le. All that means is ﬁ nding the 
empty box in the Visual Text Editor and clicking it; you’ll get the familiar red X 
for deleting. 
In the case of ﬁ les in a post’s image gallery there’s no issue with deleting from the Media Library — the ﬁ le 
just disappears from the image gallery.
Admin Settings for Media
You can change some site-wide parameters under the Settings ➪ Media link on the admin menu. The 
screen for that page is shown in Figure 19-3.
Figure 19-3
Currently, the settings only relate to image size. These are the dimensions that WordPress uses when it 
creates up to three different versions of images you’re uploading: Thumbnail, Medium, and Large. These 
are created only if the longest side of the uploaded ﬁ le is larger than the maximum dimensions for that 
version.
For example, if the maximum width or height for Medium is 300 pixels (the default WordPress setting) 
and the image being uploaded is 400 pixels wide by 270 pixels high, a Medium version will be created 
with dimensions of 300 pixels by 203 pixels. WordPress keeps the proportions of the original and makes 

155
Lesson 19: Managing Media Files
the longest side whatever you’ve set as the maximum width or height. Had the image been 270 pixels 
wide by 400 pixels high, then the Medium version created would have been 203 pixels by 300 pixels
The one exception to this is the Thumbnail setting. By default, WordPress checks the box that says 
“Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions.” This means the Thumbnail version will be exactly what’s in 
the two ﬁ elds for height and width (150 pixels by default). If you want Thumbnails to be proportional, 
you’ll need to uncheck that box.
You can also change settings for how media ﬁ les are stored on your server, by going to Settings ➪ 
Miscellaneous. However, it’s rare you’d ever want to change the default settings.

Managing Post Categories 
and Tags
As your website grows and evolves, you may need to change the names of tags or the relation-
ships between categories, for example. In this lesson I’ll show you how to manage all aspects of 
your categories and tags.
Managing Categories
I showed you in Lesson 6 how to add new categories from the Add/Edit Post screen. You also saw 
in Lesson 18 how to add and remove categories for a post through Quick Edit or how to add catego-
ries to multiple posts at one time with Bulk Edit. Now it’s time to look at managing the categories 
themselves.
You can manage categories through the Posts ➪ Categories link on the main menu, which produces 
the screen in Figure 20-1.
The left side of the screen is for adding categories and the right is for editing, moving, or deleting 
existing categories.
Adding Categories
When you add a category in the Add/Edit Post screens, you only have the option of choosing a 
category parent. Here, you can also enter a description for the category and what’s called the cat-
egory slug. 
The description is helpful when you have several people working on a site and you need to make 
clear what belongs in a particular category. Sometimes the description might be used by a theme 
or you could customize your theme to make use of it.

158
Part V: Managing Your Content
Figure 20-1
The category slug is used by WordPress to create friendly or nice versions of URLs. Normally, a WordPress 
URL for a category would be something like http://www.yourdomain.com/?cat=4, but if you have 
friendly URLs turned on using the Permalinks settings (see Lesson 25), it might look like http://www 
.yourdomain.com/jamaica-packages. The jamaica-packages part is the category slug. 
By default, WordPress takes whatever name you enter for the category and creates a slug by making it 
all lowercase and replacing spaces with dashes. However, you can enter your own slug if you’d prefer. 
You can also change the slug any time using the edit function for categories.
If you’ve had your site public for even a short time, it’s not good to mess with exist-
ing slugs. If someone has linked to your category with a friendly URL, and you 
change the slug, the URL link will be broken.
When you’ve ﬁ nished entering information for your new category, remember to click Add Category 
down at the bottom of the screen.
Editing, Moving, or Deleting Categories
On the right side of the Categories screen you see a list of all your categories in alphabetical order. If 
you have a lot of categories, remember that under Screen Options at the top, you can change how many 
are displayed at one time. If you have subcategories, they’re displayed with a dash beside them and in 
alphabetical order underneath their parent category. If you have sub-subcategories, each level is repre-
sented with an additional dash.

159
Lesson 20: Managing Post Categories and Tags
If you’re doing customization work on your WordPress theme, you’ll sometimes want 
the ID number of a category. It’s not displayed in the listing, unfortunately, but you’ll 
ﬁ nd it by mousing over the title of the category and looking in the status bar of your 
browser. You’ll see something like this: http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/
categories.php?action=edit&cat_ID=5.
That number at the end is the ID, which never changes, no matter how often you 
change the category name. You can ﬁ nd the ID for posts and pages the same way.
Like other listings, you can see an options menu appear below the title of a category by mousing over 
its row: Edit, Quick Edit, and Delete.
The Quick Edit feature allows you to change the name and the slug right there in the list. If you click 
Edit or the title of the category, you’re taken to a new screen, as shown in Figure 20-2.
Figure 20-2
This is where you can change not only the name and the slug, but the description and, most importantly, 
the parent. I like to think of changing the parent as a kind of moving process, whether it’s to a new sub-
category of a parent, or to a new parent, or to the top-level categories. This means that the posts under 
the category you’re moving will now appear in a different place on your website.
For example, if I made Sunstar Packages a subcategory of TravelWhiz Packages, they would now show 
up under the packages link on the TravelWhiz page. However, because the name and the category ID 
number remain the same, the link on the Sunstar page would still work as well. Notice that I could have 

160
Part V: Managing Your Content
bulk edited the Sunstar Package posts to be assigned to the TravelWhiz Packages category, but because 
Sunstar is now part of TravelWhiz, I don’t want to have to remember to put future Sunstar entries 
under both categories.
Posts can be in two subcategories of the same parent, but if you display a list of all posts in the parent 
category, those posts will not show up twice.
The ﬁ nal option for managing categories is to delete them. Don’t worry about the posts, however. You’re 
only deleting the category and not the posts that belong to it. However, in the case of posts that only belong 
to that category, WordPress automatically assigns them to the default category. Your best bet before delet-
ing a category is to ﬁ nd all posts in that category. For those that don’t appear in any other category, assign 
them to something appropriate, and then delete the category.
Managing the Default Category
I mentioned in Lesson 6 that posts must be in at least one category and that WordPress comes with one 
category that can never be erased — if you forget to assign a category to a post, WordPress automatically 
assigns it to this default category. Though you can never get rid of this category, you can change its name 
from the default Uncategorized to whatever you like. 
Once you’ve added at least one additional category, you can change the default category. You do this is 
under Settings ➪ Writing where you’ll see a drop-down menu for Default Post Category.
Managing Tags
Tags are managed in almost exactly the same way as categories via the Posts ➪ Post Tags link on the 
side menu. The screen in Figure 20-3 is almost exactly like the Categories screen.
The only difference between the two is that tags can’t be hierarchical — no parent-child structure.
You also see what’s called a tag cloud up at the top left. It shows the most popular tags on your site using 
size to represent the level of popularity. You can display this same tag cloud on your site using what are 
called widgets, which are covered in Lesson 21.
Another important difference between tags and categories is what happens when you delete tags. Posts 
do not have to have at least one tag, so when you delete a tag from the Post Tags screen it simply disap-
pears from any posts that used it; posts that used only that tag will not be assigned some default tag. 
If you delete a tag from a particular post, and that was the only post to which the tag had been assigned, 
the tag remains in the system. You’ll be able to see it in Post Tags and it would come up if you started 
to enter the ﬁ rst few letters in the Add Tag window of a post.

161
Lesson 20: Managing Post Categories and Tags
Figure 20-3
Converting Categories and Tags
I’ve mentioned before that categories and tags aren’t very different in their function, except that catego-
ries are usually general in nature whereas tags are speciﬁ c. You may ﬁ nd at some point that a category 
is too speciﬁ c and you would prefer that it was a tag. WordPress has a Categories and Tags Converter, 
which you can access from the list of options shown under Tools ➪ Import or from the Posts ➪ 
Categories screen shown in Figure 20-4, using the text link at the very bottom right of the page.
You simply select the category(s) that you want to convert and click Convert Categories to Tags.
Sometimes people think converting categories to tags is a way of just creating tags 
with the same names as the categories you select. No, you’re actually changing the 
categories into tags and the categories no longer exist.
WordPress reminds you that if you convert a category that has children, those subcategories will 
become individual top-level categories. So if you were relying on category hierarchy to include a post 
under several categories, you’ll need to rethink your category structure or assign the relevant posts to 
the additional category(s) you need.

162
Part V: Managing Your Content
To change tags into categories, you need to click Tags to Categories at the top of the screen. This dis-
plays a list of all existing tags and again you can either use the Check All button or select only the tags 
you want to convert.

In this lesson you practice changing an existing category by giving it a different name and assigning it 
to a parent category.
Lesson Requirements
At least four or ﬁ ve existing categories.
Step-by-Step
Changing the Name and Relationship of a Category
 1. 
Click Posts ➪ Categories on the main admin menu.
 2. 
Locate the category you want to modify.
 3. 
Click the title or the Edit link of the mouseover menu.
 4. 
Change the name of the category.

163
Lesson 20: Managing Post Categories and Tags
 5. 
From the drop-down menu, choose a parent category.
 6. 
Click Update Category.
 7. 
You should be returned to the Categories page.
 8. 
Check that your renamed category is showing below the parent category.
 9. 
You can verify that all your posts in the modiﬁ ed category are displaying under the new name 
and parent by going to your site and refreshing the category display, then clicking on the cat-
egory. Or you can go to Posts ➪ Edit and search for the posts under the re-named category.
 10. 
Change things back if you were just experimenting.

Managing Widgets
Up to now, you’ve worked with content that appears in the main body of your website, but 
WordPress makes it easy to control the content in the sidebar, without having to know HTML or 
other coding. That’s the purpose of what are called widgets. In this lesson, I show you how they 
work and how they can work for you.
What Are Widgets?
In a WordPress theme, the sidebar area of the site is controlled through coding in the template 
ﬁ les. Lists of pages, categories, links, and other information appearing in the sidebar is controlled 
by scripting written by the theme builder. This is what’s called hard-coding.
However, WordPress offers an alternative to theme builders. They can add another piece of code 
that allows users to control the structure of the sidebar through widgets. Widgets are individual 
pieces of code that can be customized and moved around with no knowledge of code. For exam-
ple, if you want to display a list of categories, there’s a widget that will do that, while allowing 
you to decide whether it appears as a list or a dropdown menu simply by checking a box. What’s 
more, you can easily move this widget so that the categories appear near the top of the sidebar 
instead of near the bottom.
When a theme is widget-enabled, the ﬁ rst time a user activates a widget, the existing sidebar code 
is ignored and visitors will only see what widgets are activated. If all widgets are removed, the 
original theme code kicks in again.
Though widgets are most commonly used for controlling content in the sidebar, theme writers are 
beginning to use them for other areas of sites as well.

166
Part V: Managing Your Content
The Widgets Screen
Widgets are controlled through the Appearance ➪ Widgets link on the side admin menu. You’re pre-
sented with the screen shown in Figure 21-1.
Figure 21-1
The left side of the screen shows the available widgets and the right shows areas on the website where 
widgets can be used. You can see Sidebar 1 on the right, and that means this theme (the default 
WordPress theme) has a single sidebar where widgets can be used. Your theme may have two sidebars 
or, as I mentioned before, there could be areas like the header, the footer, the homepage — wherever a 
theme writer has chosen to make widgets available.
The widgets you see on the left of Figure 21-1 are the default widgets that come with WordPress, but the 
list on your site could vary depending on what plugins you have installed. Plugins add new functional-
ity to WordPress and some of them use widgets to allow you to customize that functionality as well as 
control where it appears on the site.
On the left are two lists of widgets, Available and Inactive (which is not visible in Figure 21-1), and the 
difference between them is covered in the ﬁ nal section of this lesson.
Activating and Editing Widgets
Activating a widget is as simple as dragging it from the left side of the Widgets screen to an area on the 
right side of the screen. Figure 21-2A shows you what it looks like as you drag a widget across.

B
Figure 21-2
In Figure 21-2B you can see how the widget automatically opens to show you whatever options it has 
available. Notice too that there is still a Categories widget over on the left. That’s because you can use 
the same widget several times (perhaps in different areas on the site if your theme is so enabled).
With the widget open, you can make the customizations you want, such as giving it a title or setting 
variables such as how many posts to display. Some widgets will automatically start displaying content 
(Categories for example) while others require some input (such as Text or RSS). Always be sure to click 
Save when you’re ﬁ nished or else any changes you do make will not take effect.
When you’re ﬁ nished editing, you can click Close or click the down arrow at the right of the widget 
header bar (that same arrow will maximize the window too). You can also minimize or maximize the 
entire Sidebar 1 area using the down arrow on its header (and do the same for each if you have multiple 
areas in your theme).
Moving or Removing Widgets
Aside from the convenience of adding more functionality and content to your sidebar (I’ll just speak of 
sidebars because that’s how most people will be using widgets), widgets also allow you to easily change 
the look of your sidebar by reordering them. If you have Categories and then Pages, you can switch them 
around by moving Pages above Categories. The change is instantly reﬂ ected on your website. If you want 
to change the design of the sidebar, you would need to change your style sheet.
Removing or deactivating widgets is as easy as dragging them from the right side back over to the left — 
they instantly disappear from the sidebar. Instead of dragging, you can also click Remove if the widget 
is open. However, think carefully about where you move a widget over to the left.
If you drag to the Available box, you lose all your settings for that widget.
If you drag to the Inactive box, you keep all your settings. This is handy particularly if there are com-
plicated settings such as URLs or speciﬁ c wording that you might forget later. This was one of the new 
features added in WordPress 2.8 and it’s very welcome indeed!

Lesson 23: Managing Comments
Lesson 24: Connecting to Content On Other Sites
Lesson 25: Helping Others Connect to Your Site
Lesson 26: Having Multiple Site Users


Linking to Other Sites
There are several good reasons why you should be linking to other sites. First of all, you’re help-
ing your visitors by pointing them to useful information. Second, you’re building relationships 
with other sites on the Internet (you know how much you appreciate this “link love” from other 
sites). And third, it can help to some extent with better rankings in search engines (just don’t link 
excessively, and link to useful, high-quality sites — which is what your visitors want anyway).
Back in Lesson 7, I covered the creation of links in the body of a post. In this lesson, I show you 
WordPress’s built-in links manager, which allows you to create categories of links that you can 
then display in various ways. 
Managing Links
WordPress links are managed much the way posts are. From the Links area of the admin 
menu you have links to Edit, Add New, and Link Categories. The Edit Links screen shown in 
Figure 22-1 is similar to Edit Posts but with some slightly different information.
Figure 22-1

172
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
The navigation should be familiar from earlier lessons — ﬁ ltering by category, searching, and so on. 
To edit a particular link you click the Name or click Edit in the text menu that appears when you mou-
seover a row. For the key elements of a link listing, look at the top region of the Links ➪ Add New 
screen in Figure 22-2.
Figure 22-2
Here’s an overview of all your options:
Name: This is entirely up to you — it’s the title for the link that’ll appear on your Links page or 
in the sidebar.
Web Address: This is the URL of the website. WordPress reminds you to include the http:// 
at the beginning. The simplest thing of course is to highlight and copy the address out of your 
browser’s address bar, or in the case of a text link, just right-click and choose Copy Link Location.
Description: This is a short summary of or comment on the site. Not all themes make use of this 
for their Links page template, but it’s available to use if you’re customizing a theme. The descrip-
tion does, however, automatically appear as a little popup window when you mouseover the link 
and is one of the options in the Links widget.
Categories: This works in the same way as categories for posts — you can choose one or several 
categories and you can add new categories on the ﬂ y. As with posts, links can be assigned to 
multiple categories.
The lower half of the link options screen is shown in Figure 22-3.

173
Lesson 22: Linking to Other Sites
Figure 22-3
Target: This tells your browser where to open up the website when the link is clicked: either in 
a new window/tab or in the current window/tab. If you choose nothing, WordPress defaults to 
the current window/tab.
Link Relationship (XFN): (To ﬁ t everything onto the screen, this box is shown in collapsed 
mode.) The Xhtml Friends Network is a standard to show the social relationships between you 
and the people behind the sites you’re linking to, such as family, business, or romantic relation-
ships. For that purpose, clicking a relationship creates a special attribute in the HTML code for 
your link, which you can then use to designate unique styles using CSS (for example, you could 
give your “crushes” a different color than your “date” links or display an image to indicate a 
family member).
Advanced: One of the features you’re most likely to use in this box is the Rating menu. You can 
sort links by their rating or display a link’s rating. The other feature I want to mention is the 
Image ﬁ eld. You can associate an image with your link, using either a full URL (perhaps from 
the site you’re linking to) or a path to your image directory (/images/mylink.jpg). You’ll want 
the image to be fairly small, say 16 × 16 pixels, so it ﬁ ts nicely next to your link. 
Remember, if you ﬁ nd you rarely use sections like Link Relationship or Advanced, 
you can hide them altogether by going to the Screen Options button at the top right 
of the Add New Link screen and de-selecting them.
Save: There’s a checkbox here to make the link Private, which means the link will be visible 
only from the administration area.

174
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
Once you’ve entered all the information, you just click the Add Link button at the top. 
The screen where you edit a link looks exactly the same as the Add New Link screen, except you’ll see a 
Visit Link button up at the top right. That lets you test the link and make sure it’s still working.
If you need to check a number of links to see if they’re still functional, it’s easiest 
to do this from the Edit Links screen. The URL for each link is displayed there and 
you can click right through to the site.
Always remember to click Update Link when you’ve ﬁ nished making any changes.
Managing Link Categories
From Links ➪ Link Categories on the admin menu you can do pretty much the same things you can for 
post categories, with one exception: link categories are not hierarchical — you can’t have subcategories. 
Like posts, the Link Categories screen is divided into two sections, as shown in Figure 22-4.
On the left you add link categories and on the right you manage existing ones. Categories are displayed 
in alphabetical order.
To edit a link category you simply click its name or click Edit in the text menu that appears when you 
mouseover. You can also choose Quick Edit to change just the name or the slug.
This screen displays 20 links at a time and there is no option to change that, so if you have a lot of link 
categories, you’ll need to page through them using the page links at the top and bottom of the list or 
you can do a search for a particular category.
You can delete link categories individually or in bulk, using the Bulk Actions menu. As with posts, if 
you delete a link category and there are links assigned to it, they will be reassigned automatically to the 
default category — the links are not deleted.
Just like posts, WordPress also has a permanent category for links that you cannot delete. That category 
is called Blogroll (you can edit the name) and it’s set as the default category — if you forget to assign a 
link to at least one category, it automatically goes in the default category. You can choose a different 
default category under Settings ➪ Writing.

175
Lesson 22: Linking to Other Sites
Figure 22-4
Displaying Links
WordPress makes it easy to display your links without much effort. Most themes include both a sidebar 
listing of your default link category and a links page template.
Sidebar Links
You’ve probably already noticed on the Island Travel site that there are links showing in the sidebar, as 
you can see on the left portion of Figure 22-5.
Figure 22-5

176
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
The original intent of this list was for bloggers to display the links of their favorite sites — often other 
blogs. Most themes display links in the sidebar by default and when you ﬁ rst install WordPress you’ll 
see some links under the default category Blogroll. Of course, you’re able to change the name, which 
will also change the name on the sidebar. If you add more link categories, they’ll display in the sidebar 
as well.
If you’re using widgets, as I am on the Island Travel site, the default Links widget allows you to choose 
which categories of links are displayed in the sidebar, as well as whether to show an image, the name, 
the description, or the rating. In the illustration I’ve allowed the widget to show all available categories.
Link Categories in the Body of Posts
You can also use your links in other ways, including within the body of a post, through customization 
of your theme templates. You could make only the relevant link category display in a post or in the 
sidebar, based the category of the current post.
However, a simple way to make use of links on individual pages, without getting into changing coding, 
is illustrated on the Island Travel site. I have a links category for every destination in the Caribbean, so I 
simply have a graphic linked to the Links page, as shown in the right portion of Figure 22-6. This reminds 
visitors that there are links relevant to the current page, rather than relying on them to choose the Links 
page from the main menu.
Figure 22-6
The Links Page
You’ll probably only want to show the most general links in the sidebar, especially if you have a lot of 
them, as I do on the Island Travel site. The best way to display all your links is on a Links page. Most 
WordPress themes include a template for that exact purpose, which you’ll ﬁ nd in the Template drop-
down menu of the Add Page or Edit Page screens (see Lesson 10 on creating pages using templates).
What this template does is automatically display your links alphabetically and by category. Your theme 
will probably make the links look nice, but you can customize that look by editing your CSS style sheet.

Managing Comments
One of the hallmarks of blogging is the ability of visitors to leave comments on what’s been writ-
ten, and because WordPress was developed as blogging software it has an extensive comments 
system. In this lesson I show you how WordPress handles comments and some ways you can use 
them outside of a blogging context.
Allow Comments or Not?
When you’re writing a blog, having people comment on your posts is an important part of the 
blog experience. You want to open up a dialogue with your visitors and even between your visi-
tors. You might choose to close off comments after a certain period of time, but virtually no one 
with a blog would think about getting rid of comments altogether.
It’s a different story when you’re building a non-blog site with WordPress. There are far fewer 
places on the site where you would want people to comment. There’s no particular need to allow 
visitors to comment on the About Us page of the Island Travel site, for example. On the other hand, 
I want people to comment on posts about a particular travel destination or a piece of news about 
the travel industry. That’s where the individual comment control comes in handy, and I show you 
how to set that up in the next section.
The important point is that you need to consider the purposes of your website and how the 
WordPress comment function might ﬁ t in with those purposes. Every site will be different and 
every area on your site needs to be considered separately as well.
Admin Settings for Commenting
You can ﬁ nd the site-wide settings for commenting in the admin menu under Settings ➪ Discussion. 
By default, WordPress sets up the following parameters:

180
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
The comment form and existing comments will appear on any post or page.
 
❑
To post a comment visitors must ﬁ ll out their name and e-mail.
 
❑
The ability to comment is always open — there’s no time limit on the comments for a particular 
 
❑
post or page.
All comments are held for approval unless the commenter has been approved before.
 
❑
The e-mail address listed in WordPress administration will be notiﬁ ed if any comments are 
 
❑
posted or if any comments are held for moderation.
Any comment is held for moderation if it contains more than two links.
 
❑
No words or web addresses are blacklisted.
 
❑
Avatars (small graphics or photos) are displayed with each comment and a default avatar is 
 
❑
selected if the visitor doesn’t provide one.
For a blog, these are pretty basic settings, and in many cases you won’t need to make any changes. For 
a website, however, there’s one setting in particular that you’ll probably want to change and that’s the 
ability to comment on every post and page, shown in Figure 23-1, under Default Article Settings.
Figure 23-1
Don’t be confused by the use of the term “article” in the Discussion Settings. 
Article just means posts or pages.
If you turn off commenting for every post and page, you still have the ability to allow commenting on 
any particular post and page. WordPress reminds you of that when it says: These settings may be over-
ridden for individual articles. To refresh your memory, that individual comment control is found near the 

181
Lesson 23: Managing Comments
bottom of the Add New or Edit Post screens under the Discussion heading. If you’ve turned off com-
menting, the checkbox for the post will be blank; if you’ve turned it on, the box will be checked.
If you’ve had site-wide commenting turned on and then turn it off, all posts up to that time will con-
tinue to show old comments, though no new comments can be made. For new posts, commenting will 
not be available unless you manually turn it on for a speciﬁ c post.
Whichever default comments setting you choose, you’ll still need to pay attention to the Discussion 
Settings when you’re creating new posts. 
One other useful option under Settings ➪ Discussion is the ability to automatically have comments 
close after a speciﬁ ed period of time, say, 60 days. Existing comments will continue to show, there just 
can’t be any new comments. Some people use this feature if they’re having trouble blocking spam com-
ments, but they want to allow a bit of time for legitimate comments to be made.  Others don’t want to 
deal even with legitimate comments on old topics. With this feature you don’t have to remember to 
manually turn off commenting after a post has been up for a while.
If you have commenting turned on, and you’re seeing the comment box on posts but not pages, 
it’s probably because the page templates for your theme do not have the code for commenting. The 
WordPress default theme is set up this way. The assumption is that people only want commenting for 
posts and not pages. If you do want the option to have people comment on pages, you could switch to 
another theme or add the code to your current templates.
Display Order of Comments
Traditionally, blogs have shown the oldest comments ﬁ rst. Part of the reason is that comments can often 
ﬂ ow in the form of a discussion — you need to know what’s been said earlier to follow what a later com-
menter is reacting to.
However, some people prefer to show the most recent comments ﬁ rst, one theory being that visitors who 
keep returning will want to ﬁ rst see what’s new in the comments area, without having to scroll (some-
times a very long way) to the bottom.
WordPress recently made it possible to choose between the two. The default is still oldest comments 
ﬁ rst, but under Settings ➪ Discussion in the Other Comment Settings area you’ll see a drop-down 
menu allowing you to select Older or Newer comments ﬁ rst.
Threaded Comments
No matter what order comments are displayed in, comments often don’t ﬂ ow in an orderly manner. If 
someone is commenting on a point made 15 comments earlier it can get difﬁ cult to keep track of the 
conversation. That’s why WordPress offers the option of allowing threaded or nested comments. This 
displays a reply button beside each comment in addition to the comment box at the bottom of the post. 
If a visitor uses the reply button, then their comment shows up inside the comment they’re replying to. 
You can turn on this feature under Settings ➪ Discussion Settings. Look for Enable threaded (nested) com-
ments and you can also allow the nesting to go up to 10 comments deep (default is 5). Be aware, though, 
that not all themes will properly display threaded comments. Even if yours doesn’t, there are plugins to 
help you manage them or you can have your style sheet modiﬁ ed to do so. 

182
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
Finding Comments
When I was showing you the WordPress Dashboard in Lesson 4, you saw the Comments area, which 
displays several of the most recent comments. From there you can link directly to the comments admin 
area.
The other point of entry is the Comments link on the admin menu (there are no submenu items for 
this), which takes you to the Edit Comments screen, shown in Figure 23-2.
Figure 23-2
For each comment you’re shown the author’s name and a URL if the author entered one. Then you’ll 
see the comment itself, along with the date and time it was submitted. Underneath the comment, if you 
mouseover the row, you’ll see a menu with the following options:
Approve:
 
❑
 You can approve the comment (or Unapprove it depending on context).
Spam:
 
❑
 This marks the comment as spam so the information can be used by anti-spam plugins to 
learn what to block.
Delete:
 
❑
 This deletes the comment.
Edit:
 
❑
 Use this to edit the parameters of the comment, including the body, so you can remove 
bad language and so on.
Quick Edit:
 
❑
 This allows you to perform virtually all Edit tasks without going to a new screen.
Reply:
 
❑
 This lets you reply directly to the comment in the way described earlier when I talked 
about threaded comments. If your theme is set up to do so, your reply is shown with the com-
ment it’s in response to.

183
Lesson 23: Managing Comments
On the far right of the comments listing you see the title of the post that the comment was responding to, 
with a link to the posts’s edit screen. The small hash symbol (#) provides a link to the post as it appears 
on your site.
You can ﬁ lter the comments by Comments or Pings. I explain pings in more detail in Lesson 25, but 
basically these are links to your post as opposed to someone making a comment through your site.
You can also ﬁ lter comments based on whether they’re Pending (awaiting approval), Approved, or have 
been labeled as Spam.
Finally, you can search through the text of the comments by using the Search box at the top right of the 
screen.
Approving, Editing, or Deleting Comments
Assuming you’ve retained the default settings that require comments to be approved (at least the ﬁ rst 
time someone comments) and for the administrator to be e-mailed about it, you’ll know there are com-
ments waiting because you’ll get an e-mail. The other way to know is if you log in to WordPress; there’ll 
be a tiny orange icon beside Comments on the side menu, telling you how many are awaiting approval.
You can approve a comment by clicking Approve on the text menu that displays when you mouseover a 
comment on the Edit Comments screen. If you have a lot of comments to approve, just check the box for 
each, choose Approve from the Bulk Actions drop-down menu at the top or bottom, and click Apply.
Before or after you’ve approved a comment, you can edit the contents by clicking Edit on that text menu. 
You’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 23-3.
Figure 23-3

184
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
From this screen you can edit all the parameters, including the date and time it was submitted (see the 
Status box).
Notice that the comment Text Editor is available only in HTML mode and the buttons are the same as 
the ones whose functions are described in detail in Lesson 7. Visitors do not get any formatting buttons 
when entering comments, but there are plugins which offer all sorts of options in that regard.
As always, remember to click Update Comment when you’re ﬁ nished editing.
To delete a comment or comments, you again have the choice to delete individually or in bulk when 
you’re in the Edit Comments listing screen. When you’re editing an individual comment, you can delete 
it from the link in the Status box.
If you set WordPress to email you whenever a comment is being held for modera-
tion, the email will contain direct links for approving or deleting the link, or mark-
ing it as spam.
Dealing with Spam Comments
Although spam comments are dealt with from the same menus as approving or deleting, I’ve left them 
for a separate section. WordPress comes with a number of methods for dealing with spam comments 
and dozens of plugins. I talk about the plugins in Lesson 37; here I want to mention some of the built-in 
tools.
The ﬁ rst line of defense with spam comments is to make sure you require all comments to be moderated 
(not counting those visitors you’ve approved once already — if you keep that setting in place). That way 
you don’t have just anything appearing on your site without knowing about it.
On the Settings ➪ Discussion screen you’ll ﬁ nd several settings under Comment Moderation that can help 
deal with spam comments. The ﬁ rst checks how many links are contained in a comment and holds it for 
moderation if the threshold is exceeded. The default setting is 2, the idea being that spam comments will 
often contain multiple links. This option functions no matter what other moderation settings you have.
Never set this number to 0 or make the ﬁ eld blank. That would send every single 
comment to moderation, no matter what other settings you have in place.
The next option allows you to specify words, names, URLs, e-mail addresses, or even IP addresses — be 
sure to have only one item per line. If anything on this list appears in a comment, it will automatically 
be held for moderation, again, no matter what your other comments settings are.
The ﬁ nal moderation option allows you to create a blacklist. You specify words, names, and so on, but 
in this case, if a comment contains anything on the list, it’s automatically marked as spam, not simply 
put into moderation. You’re still able to approve a comment if it wrongly gets caught by this blacklist.

185
Lesson 23: Managing Comments
I keep using the term “mark as spam” and it means that not only will comments marked as spam not 
appear on your site, they’ll stay in your database and can be used by plugins (see Lesson 37) to compare 
with future comments and help determine if they’re spam too.
Try It
In this lesson you practice approving a comment.
Lesson Requirements
Have someone comment on one of your posts, or you can do it yourself as long as you log out of WordPress 
before doing so (if you’re still logged in, you’ll be commenting as an administrator and automatically be 
approved).
Step-by-Step
How to approve a comment.
 1. 
Log in to WordPress.
 2. 
On the Dashboard you should see the new comment in the Comments box and on the left side 
menu there should be at least one item in the orange icon beside Comments.
 3. 
You could approve the comment right from the Dashboard if you mouseover the comment and 
use the Approve link on the menu that appears.
 4. 
If you want to read the entire comment ﬁ rst, click Edit and when you’re satisﬁ ed mark it as 
Approved in the Status box. Finally, click Update Comment.
 5. 
From the Dashboard you can also click Pending in the Right Now box and you’ll see a list of 
comments requiring approval.
To see some of the examples from this lesson, watch the video for Lesson 23 on 
the enclosed DVD.


Connecting to Content 
on Other Sites
You can enhance the content of your site in many ways by tapping into content available on other 
sites and displaying it on your own. Just as your WordPress site can generate RSS feeds of your 
material, you can tap into the feeds generated by other sites. Some of this content may even be gen-
erated by you, as in the case of your postings on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites.
In this lesson, I show you how to integrate this content into your site and talk a bit about where to 
look for such content.
Connecting to Your Social Media Accounts
If you have social media accounts, such as Twitter or Facebook, the content you’re generating on 
those sites could be useful on your WordPress site. If you don’t have any social media accounts 
related to the topic of your site, you should get some! Then you can have your latest entries on 
those social media sites displayed automatically on your WordPress site. 
I’ll show you how it’s done with Twitter, but the process is very similar for most other sites. 
You’ll need some code from Twitter ﬁ rst, and most social media sites make it very easy to get that, 
as you can see in Figure 24-1.
Many sites make it easy, as Twitter does here, to customize how the feed will look on your site, how 
many items it will display, and so on. When you’re through customizing, you’ll click something 
like Finish & Grab Code or Generate Code, and you’re presented with the code, as in Figure 24-2.

188
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
Figure 24-1
Figure 24-2
Sometimes there will be a button to automatically copy the code for you, but in many cases you’ll need 
to do it yourself, as is the case in Figure 24-2. Place your cursor in the text box and press Ctrl+A to select 
it all, then Ctrl+C to copy it. Now you’re ready to paste the code into a widget on your site.

189
Lesson 24: Connecting to Content on Other Sites
In WordPress, go to Appearance ➪ Widgets and ﬁ nd the Text widget on the left-hand side. When you 
drag it over to the Sidebar 1 area on the right, it opens up and you can paste in your coding, as shown in 
Figure 24-3.
Figure 24-3
When you save the widget, you’ll see on your site whatever style of feed you chose on your social 
media site.
Adding Content Feeds from Other Sites
You’ve probably seen websites that have news headlines or the latest weather forecast. Usually these 
are content feeds from other websites, and though there’s much more out there than just headlines and 
forecasts, the idea is that these feeds provide constantly updated information. That information typi-
cally takes the form of a title and summary, with a link back to the original website where you get all 
the details.
The two most common methods for getting these feeds are JavaScript and RSS. You won’t need to 
know anything technical to make use of these feeds — you see shortly how WordPress widgets make 
it a snap — but it’s helpful to know a bit of background.
Always make sure you have permission to use a feed of any type. Generally sites 
are happy to have people using their feeds, but even then there may be some regis-
tration process required or even a small fee.

190
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
JavaScript Feeds
JavaScript is a language that’s used by web pages to make your browser take certain actions when you 
move your mouse, click things, leave a page, and so on. When you ﬁ ll out a form and it tells you that 
your password isn’t long enough, that’s JavaScript in action. It would be unusual these days for a web-
site not to use at least some JavaScript.
In the case of a JavaScript feed, what’s happening is that the HTML tells your browser to go to another 
website, load a particular script and run it. That’s what was happening with the Twitter coding that I 
just copied into Island Travel. There’s nothing for you to maintain; that’s all done by the website hosting 
the JavaScript.
RSS Feeds
RSS stands for, at least according to some, “really simple syndication.” Some TV shows, newspaper 
columns, and radio shows are examples of syndicated content — the producers send out their shows to 
companies that pay to show or publish the content. The beauty of RSS is that other people just click a 
button on your website and they are subscribed (through an RSS reader, for example) to your content. 
When you publish new content, it automatically shows up on their machine or on another website, 
which is what I’m talking about in this section.
Accessing RSS feeds from other sites is pretty straightforward in WordPress. Go to Appearance ➪ Widgets 
and look for a widget called RSS. Drag it over to the Sidebar area on the right, and it opens up to display the 
window shown in Figure 24-4.
Figure 24-4

Lesson 24: Connecting to Content on Other Sites
The ﬁ rst thing you’re asked for is the URL for the RSS feed. This is the information you copy from the 
website providing the feed. When you’re searching for RSS feeds, you’ll be given a URL which, if you 
open it in a browser, produces a page like this one from www.aruba.com in Figure 24-5.
Figure 24-5
Copy the URL of this page from your browser’s address bar, and then paste it into the WordPress wid-
get where it says Enter the RSS feed URL here.
You can then give a title to what will appear in your sidebar, after which you have a choice of how 
many items to display from the feed (default is 5) along with which parts of the feed you would like to 
display: Content, Author, and Date.
Click Save and close the widget. When you refresh your live site, you’ll see the RSS feed in your sidebar, 
like my Aruba feed on the Island Travel site in Figure 24-6.
You can ﬁ nd RSS feeds in two ways. If you ﬁ nd some content that could work well on your site, look for 
an RSS feed icon or link on that page — also look for permission to use the feed on your site. The other 
way is to search for RSS feeds in Google and you’ll discover dozens of directories that let you search for 
RSS feeds by topic. You can also look for “widgets” — not the kind in WordPress — which are custom 
programs, often for free, that will use JavaScript, RSS, or other means to pull content onto your site.
For the sake of simplicity, I’ve shown you how to place content in your site’s sidebar, using RSS feeds or 
JavaScript. You can also put this content into posts and pages, but you’ll need a plugin for WordPress 
that will enable code to run within the main content area of your site. You could also customize your 
theme templates to allow RSS feeds to display in a particular place outside the sidebar.

Helping Others 
Connect to Your Site
In the preceding lesson I showed you how to bring in content from other sites; now it’s time to 
look at ways WordPress can help others make use of your content. Whether it’s through a link to 
your site, publishing an RSS (really simple syndication) feed of your site, or subscribing to your 
site through their RSS reader, having people connect to your site is an important part of your pro-
motional plans and maintaining interaction with others on the Web.
RSS Feeds of Your Content
WordPress makes good on the “really simple” in really simple syndication (RSS) feeds because 
they aren’t so simple. First of all, there are many syndication formats, of which RSS is only one. 
Add to that the fact there are several versions of RSS, let alone the question of how to output 
your content in each format, and you get a sense of how complex the world of web feeds can be. 
Thankfully, WordPress takes care of all of it for you, generating four separate feeds for a post’s 
content: RSS 0.92, RSS 2.0, Atom and RDF/RSS 1.0.
Although WordPress automatically generates these different feeds, themes typically include only 
one or two (RSS2 is the most common). If you want help customizing your theme to include 
more feeds, go to http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds.
WordPress also makes it easy for your visitors to get RSS feeds for very speciﬁ c content on your 
site. If you want them to subscribe to all posts for a particular category, just create a link like 
this: http://www.yourdomain.com/categoryname/feed (the format for this link will depend 
on your Permalink settings — see the ﬁ nal section of this lesson). On the Island Travel site, for 
example, it would be good to put a link on pages about Aruba that allows visitors to subscribe to 
the post category Aruba Packages. That way they can stay up to date on the latest vacation offer-
ings. Similarly, you could have a feed for all posts tagged with the term “Kingston” or even have 
a feed for a speciﬁ c page on the site.

196
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
Although WordPress automatically generates RSS feeds, you do have a couple of parameters you can 
set for how your feeds will be displayed, and you’ll ﬁ nd them under Settings ➪ Reading, as shown in 
Figure 25-1. 
Figure 25-1
You can set the number of items to be shown in any syndication feed (the default is 10). The other 
option is whether to allow the full text to be shown in the feed or just a summary — the default is full 
text, but the choice is not cut and dried. 
The theory behind allowing the full text is that subscribers might be more likely to read it because they 
don’t have to click through to get the complete story. If your goal is primarily to get the content read, this 
option makes sense. If your goal is to drive trafﬁ c to your site, providing only a summary is a way of get-
ting readers to click through to view the rest of the material. I leave you to ponder the pros and cons. 
You can extend your RSS feed capabilities by using a third-party service, such as Feedburner, to man-
age your feeds (these services provide ways of tracking how many people are subscribing to you, what 
they’re doing when on your site, and so on). A number of plugins for WordPress make it simple to inte-
grate your site with these services, such as FD Feedburner.
Setting Pingbacks and Trackbacks
Pingbacks and trackbacks are types of notiﬁ cations that someone has linked to your site, and these 
notiﬁ cations show up in the comments on your posts. Pingbacks are the more important of the two, as 
trackbacks are really only used for linking to older blogging systems.

197
Lesson 25: Helping Others Connect to Your Site
Creating a pingback to another site is easy — just link to that site in the body of your post. In order 
for the other site owner to be notiﬁ ed, they have to have pingbacks enabled on their site. Trackbacks 
to another site also require that site’s owner to have them turned on; the difference is that you need to 
paste a special URL into the trackback notiﬁ cation box on your Add/Edit post screen, and you have to 
do that even if you linked to the site in the body of the post. 
This means that in order to receive pingbacks to your own site, you simply have to have pingbacks and 
trackbacks turned on (you’ll see how to do that in a moment). You can test that pingbacks are work-
ing by creating a link in one of your posts to another of your posts, and then watch for the pingback to 
show up in the comments. If you want people to be able to trackback to your site, you’ll have to provide 
them with the trackback URL that they need to paste into their trackback box. Check if your theme dis-
plays the trackback URL — the default theme doesn’t, for example. If not, you can add it by modifying 
the necessary template(s) in your theme.
So how do you make sure pingbacks and trackbacks are enabled on your WordPress site? Go to 
Settings ➪ Discussion and you’ll see this under Default Article Settings (Figure 25-2).
Figure 25-2
By default, WordPress allows trackbacks and pingbacks for all posts and pages. You can turn this off 
and you would still be able to activate them for individual posts or pages in the Discussion section of 
the Add or Edit screens, but it’s simplest to leave this activated for everything. If you have WordPress 
set to allow comments to appear only after they’ve been approved, the same will be true for trackbacks 
and pingbacks. You can moderate the ones that appear in the Dashboard or click through to the Edit 
Comments area if you have more waiting.
Because trackbacks to your site can be created without the other site owner actually linking to you in the 
body of a post, some people don’t feel they’re reliable indicators that someone has linked to you. Others ﬁ nd 
they get a lot of spam through trackbacks. WordPress enables/disables pingbacks and trackbacks together, so 
they’re either both on or both off. There are some plugins that allow you to deal with them separately.
Setting Permalinks
You want other sites to link to your content — it’s one of the most important ways to build trafﬁ c to 
your site — but you want to make sure that, over time, those links don’t end up pointing to the wrong 
page. On a blog, for example, posts only display on the front page until they’re replaced with newer 

198
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
posts. On websites in general the title of a post may get changed or a post might be moved from one 
category to another.  That’s good for ﬂ exibility, but not so good for people linking to your content. It 
would be like moving to another city and not letting your friends and family know where you are. One 
way to solve the problem is to have a permanent address for each post on your site, and WordPress does 
that through what are called permalinks.
Every post, page, and category in WordPress has a ﬁ xed permalink. That’s because they all have unique 
and permanent IDs — even if you delete something, its ID cannot be used again. An example of such a 
link would be http://www.yourdomain.com/?p=45. As long as someone knows that URL, they can 
always get to item #45. 
You can see the permalink for a post or a page just below the Title area (it won’t show until you’ve entered 
something for the title), as illustrated in Figure 25-3.
Figure 25-3
However, WordPress’s default permalinks are not very memorable URLs and they don’t give search 
engines much of a hint as to what the content is for a particular item (I talk more about permalinks and 
search engines in Lesson 31). That’s why you can tell WordPress to show the world very different sorts 
of permalinks.
Under Settings ➪ Permalinks you can customize the look of these links as much as you’d like — the 
screen is shown in Figure 25-4.
The default setting is shown at the top, and then you see several suggested presets (I generally use the 
third one down — Month and Name). You can even create your own custom permalinks using the set 
of tags at the WordPress.org website — a link is provided at the top of the Permalinks page.

199
Lesson 25: Helping Others Connect to Your Site
Figure 25-4
If you switch to one of these custom settings, you’ll ﬁ nd that the permalinks option also changes below 
the titles of posts and pages, as shown in the upper half of Figure 25-5.
Figure 25-5

200
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
You can also edit the wording — just click the Edit button and you’ll be able to change the last section 
of the permalink, as shown in the bottom half of Figure 25-5. For example, if you have a very long title 
such as “A great way to see Kingston on just $30 per day” you could go in and edit the permalink to say, 
perhaps, “inexpensive-tours-of-kingston.” 
It’s all well and good to say that you can edit the permalink, but you need to be 
careful. If you’ve just created the post or page, changing the permalink even a day 
or two later could be a problem. Anyone who’s linked to that content before you 
made the change is going to get an error — their link won’t work. If you need to 
change a permalink, try to do it before you publish the piece, or as soon after you 
publish as possible.

the enclosed DVD.

Having Multiple Site Users
Even in a small company or organization, you may need more than one person working on your 
website. At the same time, you may not want each of those people to have the same access to the 
site, such as the ability to change the theme or delete pages. WordPress makes the management of 
these various levels of access quite easy through what are called roles.
The whole purpose of having different roles is to prevent people from making bad mistakes and 
doing something that affects the entire site. That’s where careful thinking about a user’s require-
ments is so crucial — you only want them to have permissions that allow them to do their par-
ticular work.
User Roles and Their Capabilities
There are ﬁ ve user roles in WordPress and in order of decreasing capabilities they are:
Administrator
 
❑
Editor
 
❑
Author
 
❑
Contributor
 
❑
Subscriber
 
❑
In the case of Island Travel, with its two ofﬁ ces, I could have a single Administrator to take care of 
technical aspects of the site, and a single Editor who oversees all site content. Each travel agent could 
be an Author managing their own posts, with a few non-agency people who act as Contributors. 
Customers and potential customers could be Subscribers who are able to view website content that 
the public can’t see.

202
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
With these examples in mind, let’s go through each of the ﬁ ve user roles in a bit more detail:
Administrator
 
❑
: As the name suggests, an Administrator has access to every single administra-
tive function in WordPress, including editing theme ﬁ les, changing themes, adding plugins, user 
details, and so on. It’s probably not a good idea to have more than a couple of Administrators or 
they could wind up overriding each other’s work — the “too many cooks” syndrome.
Editor
 
❑
: The Editor role allows the maximum amount of control over all the content of the web-
site, without being able to change settings that control the site itself, such as themes or plugins. 
Editors can add or delete any content-related items in WordPress, including categories, posts, 
pages, and links. They have full access to the media library and full control over publishing con-
tent. Editors can also add and delete users, but they cannot edit user information.
Author
 
❑
: Authors within WordPress are meant to be like columnists in a newspaper or magazine. 
They have full control over their own content — adding, editing, publishing, and deleting — but 
no one else’s. Authors cannot add or delete post or link categories and they cannot use unﬁ ltered 
HTML in their posts — code such as JavaScript or certain HTML tags or attributes pasted from a 
program like Dreamweaver. 
Contributor
 
❑
: Contributors can create, edit, or delete their own posts, but they cannot publish 
those posts (they can save drafts). They can’t edit or delete even their own posts once those have 
been published by an Editor or Administrator. Contributors do, however, appear on the Post 
Author drop-down menu.
Subscriber:
 
❑
 The name of this user role shouldn’t be confused with subscribing to a website or 
blog through an RSS feed. In this case, Subscriber is meant in the sense of a registered visitor — 
someone who can see content or take actions on a site that unregistered visitors can’t. Basically 
the only permissions subscribers have in the admin section is the ability to change their proﬁ le 
(name, e-mail, interests, avatar, and so on).
For complete details on each role’s capabilities, check out the WordPress site at http://codex.wordpress 
.org/Roles_and_Capabilities.
Adding a User
There are two ways to become a user on a WordPress site: being added manually by an Administrator 
or registering through a registration form. The automated form is meant for easily signing up subscrib-
ers so they can view special content on your site, and you would use the manual process for adding any 
of the other roles.
By default, the automated sign-up form is disabled. You activate it on the Settings ➪ General screen 
by checking off the Membership box. The word “membership” is a bit confusing because what you’re 
setting here is the ability for people to register themselves as new users on the system. There is no 
user role called “member” and you may or may not think of the users who sign up as members. The 
wording on the drop-down menu just below is clearer: New User Default Role. This sets the role that 

203
Lesson 26: Having Multiple Site Users
users will be assigned when they register themselves, as well as the default role in the drop down menu 
when manually creating new users. By default, that role is Subscriber. 
Don’t change the Default User Role unless you’ve really thought things through. 
Even allowing just anyone to become a Contributor opens up your system to people 
posting content (even if they can’t publish) and being listed on the drop-down 
author menu for posts. And you certainly wouldn’t want to allow just anyone to be 
an Editor, Author, or Administrator.
To manually add a new user to the system, click Users ➪ Add New on the main admin menu and you’ll 
be greeted with the screen shown in Figure 26-1.
Figure 26-1
At the very top you’ll see a notice, which in this case says “Users cannot currently register themselves.” 
There’s a link there and it takes you to the Settings ➪ General screen that I just talked about. If you 
change the default setting to allow visitors to register themselves as users, the notice would remind you 
that they can do so and provide the same link in case you want to switch back to the default.
You need only three things to create a new user: a username, an e-mail address, and a password. You’ll 
also want conﬁ rm which role you’re assigning to the user (the default is Subscriber). When you create 
a new user, login details are e-mailed to the user by default. If you don’t want them e-mailed, uncheck 

204
Part VI: Making Your Site Social
the Send Password box. Once users have their login information, they can change or ﬁ ll in any of the 
ﬁ elds on the proﬁ le screen I showed you in Lesson 5 (except the username).
Usernames and e-mail addresses must be unique. WordPress warns you if either exists already in the system.
Changing a User’s Capabilities
Need to promote a Contributor to Author status? Tired of one of the Administrators always switching 
themes and you want to bump them down to Subscriber? An Administrator can change a user’s role by 
going to Users ➪ Authors & Users, ﬁ nding the user on the list, and going into their personal proﬁ le by 
clicking Edit, which appears when your mouse moves over a listing. Figure 26-2 shows the top portion 
of the resulting personal proﬁ le screen.
Figure 26-2
Just below the Username is the drop-down menu for their role. Select a role and click Update User.
If you need to change large numbers of users at once, go to Users ➪ Authors & Users and check off all 
the users you want to change. Then from the Change Role To drop-down menu at the top of the page, 
select the new role and click Change, as shown in Figure 26-3.

205
Lesson 26: Having Multiple Site Users
If all or most of the users have the same role, you can speed up the process by ﬁ ltering the page by role 
using the menu just below the page title. 
Figure 26-3
Users and Security
Following are three key points concerning users and security:
 1. 
Choose the lowest possible role: Don’t make someone an Editor when they really just need to 
be an Author. The higher the role, the more power you’re entrusting to the user. And if you turn 
on the self-registration feature, don’t allow users to sign up for anything more than Subscriber.
 2. 
Emphasize the importance of tough passwords: You may give new users a diabolical pass-
word, but they can go in and change that later. Impress on them the need to not use natural 
language words, and to use upper- and lowercase, numbers, and so on. (WordPress has this 
reminder and a strength indicator that gives users an extra nudge.)
 3. 
Monitor your users: In particular if you have more than a few users, it’s important to check 
your list of users on a regular basis. The unexpected appearance of a new user with a high-end 
role could be the sign of a hacker.

Part VII: Customizing 
the Look of Your Site
Lesson 27: Customizing Your Header Content
Lesson 28: Customizing the Look of Posts
Lesson 29: Customizing Design and Layout


Customizing Your 
Header Content
Unless you have a WordPress theme custom-built for you, you’ll usually need to make some 
adjustments to get your site looking the way you want it. This is particularly true if you’re build-
ing a business website with WordPress, and the most important change to make is in the header 
portion of the theme — adding a company logo, for example. In this lesson I use the Island Travel 
site to show you some ways in which you can customize your header content.
Parts of this lesson are going to require some FTP work and some HTML. If you had someone 
install WordPress for you, you might want hire that person or a web designer to take care of this 
section for you.
Built-in Header Customization
Some WordPress themes make it easy to change elements on your site, including the header, with-
out getting into style sheets or uploading new graphics. The default theme is an example of this. 
If you go to Appearance ➪ Custom Header you’re presented with a view of the header area of 
your site. You can make changes to the color scheme or you can revert to the original colors.
If you click Font Color, Upper Color, or Lower Color, a popup color picker appears and you choose 
from that palette. In Figure 27-1 you can see how I’ve changed the lower portion of the blue gradi-
ent as well as the color of the title, and now the color picker for the Upper area is visible.

210
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Figure 27-1
When you click Update Header, the live site shows your changes. Not all themes offer this or other 
kinds of customization, but it might be a consideration when you’re choosing a theme.
Using the Theme Editor
No matter which theme you have, WordPress makes it easy to alter the style sheet (and other ﬁ les) 
using the Theme Editor. Go to Appearance ➪ Editor and, by default, you’ll see your current theme’s 
style sheet ready for editing. You’re looking at the actual ﬁ le on the server, so remember that when you 
save changes here, they’re happening live on the site.
How do you know which CSS rules are controlling your theme’s title? The simplest way to ﬁ nd out is to 
right mouse click and select View Source while browsing your site, and ﬁ nd the text for the title. Then 
make a note of the HTML tag for the title and any id or class attributes (remember to look at the HTML 
just before the title as well, because it may have a role in controlling the title).
In the case of the title, it’s fairly easy because for most WordPress themes, it will be the only H1 tag 
on the entire site. Now you know what to look for as you scroll down the style sheet in the Editor, as 
shown in the upper half of Figure 27-2.
Suppose I want to change the look of the title of my site. I can see from the H1, H2, H3 rule that these 
headings have all been assigned the same font family. In this case I only want to change the font fam-
ily for H1. I could create a new rule just for H1, but you can see that there already is a rule for that, so I 
simply add the new font family, as you can see in the lower portion of Figure 27-2. You can also see that 
I changed the font-size and alignment at the same time.

211
Lesson 27: Customizing Your Header Content
Figure 27-2
When the changes are done, click Update File and then you can refresh the live site and see what it 
looks like.
When you try to save changes in the theme editor, you may get a warning message that says “You may 
need to make this ﬁ le writable…” This means that you do not have sufﬁ cient permission to change the 
ﬁ le. You have a couple of options. You can either use an FTP program to download your theme’s style 
sheet, make changes on your computer and upload it again, or try to get the permissions changed so that 
you can use the WordPress interface.
Adding a Logo
Having a logo or other branding graphics will be important for any site beyond a personal blog. In this 
section, I show you a couple of options for placing a logo in the header area of the site.
Logo Plus Existing Title Text
The ﬁ rst option is to keep the default title text and add a logo to the right or the left of it. This will 
involve editing the header ﬁ le, the style sheet, and uploading the logo to your server. All of this could 
be accomplished in a number of ways, but there’s only space enough to show you one. 
The ﬁ rst step is to create a properly sized version of your logo in a .gif or .png format so its background 
can be transparent. To know the size, just look in your style sheet for the height given to the area con-
taining the title and description for the site. In the case of the default theme, the CSS name for the area 
is headerimg and it’s 192 pixels tall. I want my logo to ﬁ t easily within that, so I’m going with a height 
of 120 pixels.

212
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Now take a look at the HTML code for the part of the header I’m going to be working with, as high-
lighted in the theme editor in Figure 27-3.
Figure 27-3
I can see that headerimg, containing my title and description, is a distinct division (div) inside a larger 
division called header. Because I want my logo to be on the left side of the title, it will need a CSS rule 
that says keep it to the left of headerimg. I’m also going to need HTML code to tell WordPress where to 
ﬁ nd my logo and it looks like this:
<img id=”logo” src=”<?php bloginfo(‘template_directory’);?>/images/logo.gif” />
The bloginfo(‘template_directory’) command is a WordPress template tag so that no matter 
which theme I’m using, it will look in the proper folder on the server. The id=”logo” is a unique iden-
tiﬁ er that I can use in my CSS style sheet to make the logo image do whatever I want.
I place this code for the logo into my header.php ﬁ le just before the headerimg division, and click 
Update File to save changes to the header ﬁ le. Using my FTP program, I upload the logo.gif ﬁ le into 
the images folder of the default theme.
If I don’t do anything with my CSS style sheet, the header will look like the top half of Figure 27-4 (I had 
to highlight the white title or it wouldn’t have been visible).

213
Lesson 27: Customizing Your Header Content
Figure 27-4
Clearly, that’s not what I want. Using the theme editor, then, I’ll update the CSS rules for the title and 
description. Currently they’re both centered, so I need to change their text alignment so that they’ll be 
ﬂ ush left to the logo, like so:
h1 {
    font-size: 4em;
    text-align: left;
}
#headerimg .description {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    text-align: left;
}
I also need to add some rules to govern the logo itself; keep it to the left of the title and ensure it’s not 
up at the top left of the header. The resulting CSS looks like this:
#logo {
    float: left;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-left: 200px;
    padding-right: 25px;
}

214
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
After saving the style sheet, you can see the changes in the lower half of Figure 27-4. 
Of course there’s much more you could do to customize the header area. Notice all the space over on the 
right. With adjustments to your header template ﬁ le you could, for example, place a banner in that space 
announcing current specials, or whatever you like.
You can do more with branding by also changing the background image, and that’s something I cover 
in Lesson 29.
Replacing the Title Text
If your logo contains the title of your site, you’ll want to get rid of the header text and description alto-
gether. I’ll do that now for the Island Travel site.
As in the previous section, I’ll create a transparent logo, this time with the company title and description 
in it, and I’ll upload it to the images folder of the theme. I’ll need exactly the same HTML code for the 
image, but this time, instead of putting it before the headerimg division, it will go inside headerimg and 
replace all of the coding that showed the title and description. Here’s what that part of my header.php 
template ﬁ le looks like now:
<div id=”header” role=”banner”>
<div id=”headerimg”>
<img id=”logo” src=”http://islandtravel.shortordersites.com/
wp-content/themes/default/images/logo.gif” />
    </div>
</div>
I could have eliminated the headerimg division altogether, but I might want to put other content in the 
header at a later date and the headerimg division would be helpful for positioning that content.
If you’re not going to use the default title and description in your header, don’t change or erase them in 
the admin settings. They’re used for many purposes besides the header, the most important being in the 
title area of your browser (which is used by search engines to index your site).
Once I’ve updated the header template, I can adjust the positioning of the logo (if you’re trying this after 
making the changes in the previous section, remember to get rid of the rules for #logo). In this case I want 
to center the logo in the header area and after a bit of trial and error I get the following:
#logo {
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-left: 160px;
}
 After updating my style sheet, I refresh the live site and the result is shown in Figure 27-5.

All of these examples are meant to show you the basics of making these kinds of changes to the header 
of your site. How you make the changes on your particular theme, how you position graphics, and so 
on, will be different in every case, but the idea is the same.
Try It
In this lesson you change the alignment of the title and description in the default theme.
Lesson Requirements
Make sure you’re running the default WordPress theme.
Step-by-Step
How to change the alignment of the title and description
1. 
Go to Appearance ➪ Editor.
 2. 
Check that you’re viewing the style sheet for the default WordPress theme — it will say 
Stylesheet at the top and the Theme Name will be at the top of the text area.

216
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
 3. 
The title of your site is governed in the default theme by the HTML tag h1, so look for that in 
your style sheet. You want the rule that says font-size: 4em and text-align: center. 
 4. 
Change the text alignment to left.
 5. 
The rule governing the description should be immediately after the h1 rule. It will be named 
#headerimg .description.
 6. 
Change the text alignment to left.
 7. 
Click Update File.
 8. 
On the live site, refresh your browser and check that the change has been made.
 9. 
Put the title and description back to the original setting if this was just an exercise.

the enclosed DVD.

Customizing the Look of Posts
A good deal of the look of a website has to do with the look and layout of the text. Whether it’s 
choosing fonts, choosing sizes, or choosing colors, the appearance of your text is important not 
only for a uniﬁ ed look, but for the site’s readability. In Lesson 8 I talked about using the Text 
Editor to lay out individual posts. Now I want to look at using the style sheet to control the look 
of all posts.
Making Text Easy to Read
The following are four key elements to the readability of text on the Internet:
The font
 
❑
The size of the text
 
❑
The spacing between lines of text 
 
❑
The width of the text area
 
❑
Most of these elements will be taken care of in a well-built theme, but you still may want to 
change them. 
In the case of Island Travel, you’ve no doubt noticed that all the text is justiﬁ ed — the left and 
right margins are ﬂ ush. And you may remember me saying that, for the most part, I don’t like 
justiﬁ ed text. So I’m going to change my style sheet to get rid of the justiﬁ cation.
The ﬁ rst step is to ﬁ nd out what CSS rule is governing the justiﬁ ed text on the site. By looking at 
the source code for Island Travel I know that text within any division named “post” will be justi-
ﬁ ed, so in my style sheet I look for the post rule that says text-align: justify; and I change it 
to text-align: left;. After saving my style sheet and refreshing my browser, the result can be 
seen in the left half of Figure 28-1.

218
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Figure 28-1
That’s the text alignment I was looking for. But there’s something else that’s not quite right for my eye, 
and that’s the spacing between lines. I like it more open so that the text does not feel as cramped. 
A search through my style sheet reveals that the line height (space between lines) is being controlled 
not by the post class, but the entry class (.narrowcolumn .entry and .widecolumn .entry to be 
precise), so I change that from 1.4 em to 1.6em. After saving and refreshing, my text now looks like the 
right half of Figure 28-1.
The font face and the size of the text are already good for what I want, so that completes my styling of 
text for readability. Now it’s time to make text elements match my design.
Coloring Links and Headings
The color of text elements is important to maintaining a uniﬁ ed look throughout your site, so let’s look 
at how CSS can control the colors of things like links, headers, and body text.
Link Colors
A couple of common approaches to the coloring of links exist: base it on a background color or use a 
contrasting color. In the case of Island Travel, for example, I could use a variation on brown that compli-
ments the background or I could use green or blue — the highlight colors I’ve chosen for other elements 
in the graphics.
Turning to the CSS style sheet, the rules for links generally are found near the top of the style sheet or 
perhaps in a section called links or typography. At this point I’m looking for the general rules governing 

219
Lesson 28: Customizing the Look of Posts
the HTML link tag <a>. The two most common rules will be for “a” and “a:hover,” the latter being the 
state of the link when you mouseover it. There may be several rules for speciﬁ c link types (such as the 
links in post metadata, category links, and so on) so you’ll need to do some hunting. In the case of the 
default WordPress theme here’s what I ﬁ nd:
a, h2 a:hover, h3 a:hover {
    color: #06c;
    text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
    color: #147;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Typically, CSS style sheets will use a numeric code to represent colors; for example, a medium dark 
blue is represented by #1B1BB3 (hexadecimal) or RGB(27,27,179). In this case the style sheet is using the 
three-character short form of the hexadecimal code. In order to change the color of my links I’ll need to 
ﬁ nd out the corresponding codes. You can get these codes from a graphics program or an online con-
verter (my favorite is Color Scheme Designer at www.colorschemedesigner.com).
I’ll try all three colors for my travel agency links and see what they look like. Unfortunately the differ-
ences don’t show up in black and white illustrations, so I can’t demonstrate them here but you’ll be able 
to see them in the video for this lesson.
The brown does not stand out all that well in the body of the text, and the blue is being used for the links 
on the sidebar, so I think I’ll go with the green as a nice link highlight.
Heading Colors and Styling
The other important color decision for site-wide text involves headings, such as for pages, posts, or sec-
tions of the sidebar. You want to make sure that these complement your color scheme. To ﬁ nd out what 
style sheet names are controlling your headings, check the source code of your site, but if the theme is 
built properly, headings should use tags that begin with H: h1, h2, h3, h4, and so on. The numbers are 
meant to correspond to the importance of the heading. The h1 tag is usually reserved for the title of 
the website, so you’re typically concerned with h2 or h3 when looking for headings within the body 
or sidebar.
On the Island Travel site, I want to make all of my page and post headings blue. Those headings are 
governed by the h2 tag. When I check my style sheet, I see that h2 and h3 tags are colored by the same 
rule. I don’t want to change the color of all h2 and h3 tags, only the ones at the tops of single pages 
or posts. Those h2 tags are always inside a division called “post” so I can create a new CSS rule just 
for them. Not only do I want the titles blue, but I want them a bit larger than they currently are and it 
would be nice to add a bit of decoration, so I’m putting a gray line just above the heading. The code I 
add to the end of my style sheet looks like this:
.post h2 { color: #21759B; padding-top: 5px; border-top: 2px solid #a6a6a6; }
The border property tells the browser to place a gray solid line that’s 2 pixels thick on top of the letters, 
while the padding property tells the browser to leave a 5-pixel space between the letters and the gray line.
The result of this new CSS rule is shown in Figure 28-2.

220
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Figure 28-2
Style sheets allow you to do so much with headings — you could create a colored bar across the page 
with the heading in white, or you could create a graphic that appears to the left of the heading; the pos-
sibilities are limited only by your imagination (and how easy it is for your visitors to read!).
Creating Special Text Areas with CSS
Sometimes it’s useful to draw attention to certain text by creating a frame or box around which all the 
other text ﬂ ows. You can do very basic boxes using some CSS.
To make this very easy to use, I’m going to create a CSS class, so the rule can be used over and over 
again on the site. I’ll call this class “rightbox” because I’m making it ﬂ oat to the right of all the other 
text. I could then make a class called “leftbox” for when I want the frame to ﬂ oat to the left.
In my CSS rule for rightbox I do the following:
float: right; — All other text ﬂ ows around it on the left
width: 150px; — Sets the width of the box, but it can’t be so wide that it crowds the text 
ﬂ owing around it
margin-left: 10px; — Create some space between its border and the other text
border: 1px solid #000000; — Give the box a thin solid black border
padding: 10px; — Give some space between the border and the text inside the box
background-color: #efefef; — Give the box a light gray color

221
Lesson 28: Customizing the Look of Posts
I save that new rule at the end of style.css and now it’s time to create a text box in one of my posts.
I switch to the HTML mode of my Text Editor and ﬁ nd the place in my post where I want the text box 
to begin and place my cursor there. Then I type in <div class=”rightbox”>, enter my text, and type 
</div>. After saving the post, the result on the live site is shown in Figure 28-3.
Figure 28-3
If you switch to Visual mode while editing the post, you won’t see the <div> tags and you won’t see the 
box effect because Visual mode does not display posts using the theme’s style sheet. However, you can 
verify that the text is being controlled by the new rule by checking the status bar at the bottom left of 
the Text Editor while your cursor is anywhere in that text. It should say “path: div.rightbox.”

Customizing Design 
and Layout
I’ve shown you ways to incorporate your logo or other branding graphics into the header, but 
what else can be done to truly make the look of the site your own? In this lesson I show you how 
to change the background of the header and of the site, and I switch the sidebar location to match 
the original plans for Island Travel. 
Changing the Background of the Header
The Island Travel logo looks okay in the default theme header, but it would be nice to have it look-
ing exactly the way I’d like, and that means changing the background image. However, it’s impor-
tant to understand exactly what needs changing because web pages often have a structure that’s 
different from what appears onscreen.
In the case of the WordPress default theme, it looks at ﬁ rst as if all I need to change is the rounded 
blue background behind the logo. But if I place my cursor over that region and right-click to View 
Background Image, I see the graphic in Figure 29-1 (this only works in Firefox; for Internet Explorer 
you Save or Copy Background and open it up to view it).
Notice that the blue region has a border and then a bit of gray that matches the overall back-
ground color of the site. This is how web designers achieve most of what you see on the Internet: 
visually separate elements may be a single graphic and visually uniform areas may be comprised 
of separate elements.

224
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Figure 29-1
Because this graphic is more than just the blue area of the header, and I’m planning to change the back-
ground color of the site, I’ll have to change the background on this image to match.
To save a lot of time or money, be sure you’ve settled on a background for the site 
before making these changes. You’ll need to add that same background to all the 
other site graphics as well, and if it’s not right, there’ll be a lot of changes to make.
I’ll also need to ensure that the white border area and thin black border still match up with the back-
ground image behind the rest of the site. This is where you’ll test your skills in a graphics program or 
else turn over this aspect of your site to a web designer.
Of course I don’t have to keep the exact same visual structure (borders, height of the header area, and so 
on) that the default theme is using, but it’s a useful exercise to show how to maintain that structure in 
case you have a theme that you really like but just want to change minor aspects of the look.
So, having made the changes — being sure to name the graphic exactly as it appears in the theme — 
Figure 29-2 shows what the new header background looks like on the live site after I’ve uploaded it to 
the images folder of the theme.
You can see how the background of the site no longer matches, but I’ll ﬁ x that in the next section. The 
header, though, does much more to help brand Island Travel as a tropical vacation website.

225
Lesson 29: Customizing Design and Layout
Figure 29-2
Changing Theme Graphics
As you saw with the header background, the simplest way to make a theme look exactly the way you want 
is to keep the existing visual structure (presumably that’s what you liked about the theme in the ﬁ rst place) 
and just change colors or textures. It’s time to do that for the remainder of the Island Travel site.
First thing is to make an inventory of what needs to be changed. If you’re familiar with HTML you 
could do that from the source code in your browser or from the CSS style sheet, but I like to work visu-
ally so I just do the View Background Image method for all areas of the site.
In the case of the default WordPress theme, just two additional background graphics control the overall 
look of the site, as you can see from Figure 29-3.
Figure 29-3

226
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
The top graphic is the background for the main body of the site — the white area of the content and the 
gray of the sidebar — while the lower graphic is for the footer area of the site.,  In both cases, of course, 
I’ll need to replace the little strips of gray background color around the edges with the sandy color I’ve 
chosen my overall site background. I like the gradient toward the bottom of the footer bar, so I’ll keep 
that, but I’ll color it a very light blue. 
The content area remains white, so no changes there. But the sidebar is a different matter. It might be a 
bit hard to see in Figure 29-3, but the sidebar has a light gray area behind it. However, I want the sidebar 
on the left of the screen, so this graphic is going to have to reﬂ ect that. The width is a good one, so I’ll 
keep that, but I’ll change the light gray to a light blue.
Keep copies of all the work you do in your graphics program, or have your web 
designer hold on to copies for you. If you change your mind about something (now 
or six months down the road) it can easily be updated without having to do it from 
scratch again.
Remembering to keep the names of the ﬁ les exactly as they were, and uploading them to the images 
folder of the theme (or whatever folder the theme uses), you can see what all these changes look like in 
Figure 29-4.
Figure 29-4
If the background of the entire site is created using a graphic — as it is in the case of the WordPress 
default theme — you’re simply replacing the graphic as with the other images. If the background is gen-
erated entirely with CSS color codes, you’ll need to change the style sheet.

227
Lesson 29: Customizing Design and Layout
Everything’s looking good, except of course that the sidebar text is still over on the right and the colored 
area for the sidebar is over on the left; time for some style sheet work.
Moving the Sidebar
What you’re about to see is a great demonstration of the power of using style sheets and templating the 
HTML. With just a few coding changes in a single ﬁ le, the entire Island Travel structure will be trans-
formed on every page of the site.
Basically, I’m just going to tell the sidebar region and the content region to switch the relationship that 
the current style sheet rules are giving them. In the default theme style sheet, these rules are far apart 
in the coding, so I’ve brought them together in the top half of Figure 29-5 and put the new coding below 
that for ease of comparison.
Figure 29-5
The original CSS at the top is telling the content area (narrowcolumn) to ﬂ oat to the left of the sidebar. 
I’ve switched the styling to make the content area do the opposite, as well as change padding to match 
the new relationship. 
I’ve also taken the opportunity to make the content area a bit larger and the sidebar a bit smaller (I also 
adjusted the background image so that the light blue sidebar is narrower). You can see the results of the 
CSS changes on the live site in Figure 29-6.

228
Part VII: Customizing the Look of Your Site
Figure 29-6
If you compare this with my original concept for the Island Travel site, you can see that it’s a bit differ-
ent. Part of that is because I wanted to illustrate how to maintain the original default theme look while 
changing it enough to suit my needs. I also decided on a light brown background for the site instead of 
the green. When it came down to it I found the green too overpowering.

Part VIII: Becoming Search 
Engine Friendly
Lesson 30: Optimizing Your Content
Lesson 31: Optimizing Your Site as a Whole


Optimizing Your Content
The most common way for people to ﬁ nd a website is through search engines, but although searches 
return thousands, even millions of pages of results, few people go past even the third or fourth page. 
It’s no surprise then that so much attention is paid to achieving high search engine rankings. Search 
engine optimization (SEO) is a complex and constantly changing topic, well beyond the scope of this 
book, but in this and the following lesson I show you some things you can do in WordPress to better 
your chances of good rankings.
I think the healthiest way to think about SEO is to keep in mind the goal of search engines: to 
deliver results in order of greatest relevance to the search terms entered. The faster their users can 
ﬁ nd the right information, the better, so search engines work very hard to try and make sure the 
sites they rank highest will be the most useful to their clients. If you work hard to make sure your 
site is useful to your visitors, the better your chance of being ranked well for the search terms most 
relevant to your site. In other words, think about your visitors’ needs ﬁ rst.
Having said that, you can use some techniques to make sure that your great content conforms to 
the ways search engines read that content.
Writing Useful Titles
In this section I cover the importance of relevant titles for posts. There is another kind of title used 
in HTML coding for links and images, but I’m leaving those for their respective sections later in 
this lesson.
Having a good title for posts is crucial because of the number of ways that WordPress uses them, all 
of which are related to search engine ranking. Take a look at the highlighted coding in Figure 30-1.

234
Part VIII: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
Figure 30-1
 1. 
In most themes, the <title> tag of the post’s HTML page uses the title of your website (set 
under Settings ➪ General) along with the title of the post.
 2. 
When the title is linked, WordPress creates a title attribute for the link tag which says 
“Permanent link to (the title itself goes here).”
 3. 
As the ﬁ rst H2 element in the HTML, a post’s title ranks very high in the structural hierarchy.
These are all elements that search engines use in various ways when calculating the relevance of a page, 
and WordPress automatically makes sure your title is placed in each of them — it’s up to you to make 
sure the title is relevant.
By relevant, I don’t just mean relevant to the content of the post. A title also needs to match the wording 
visitors are likely to use when searching. You need to think of not only what information your audience 
wants, but the terms in which they want to be spoken to. Very likely, those same terms are ones they’ll 
use when searching. 
Though the details of what makes a relevant or useful title will always depend on the particular post, a 
few guidelines can be helpful from a search standpoint:
Be succinct: If you look at the titles of results in search engines you’ll notice that they’re trun-
cated if they’re too long (around 60 characters is the typical stopping point). It would nice for 
your entire title to show in the search results, but at the very least have the most important 
words ﬁ rst.
Use key search terms: Looking at search results again you’ll see that search terms are high-
lighted everywhere, including the title for each result. If your title has that search term in it, 

235
Lesson 30: Optimizing Your Content
you’ll beneﬁ t from the highlighting. And following on what I said about succinct titles, put the 
key search terms as near the beginning of the title as you can.
Don’t try to be fancy: If you can work a good turn of phrase into a title while keeping it clear 
and succinct, more power to you, but don’t worry about being clever (unless that’s important to 
your visitors).
If you’re having trouble boiling down the content into a succinct title, it may be that you’re biting off 
more than your visitors can chew in a single post. Would the material be better handled in smaller 
units? Looking at it from a search engine’s point of view, if too much of the content is not directly 
related to the title, it seems to the search engine that relevance is lost and the ranking could go down. 
Your visitors may see the relevance, but search engine algorithms aren’t as sophisticated.
You can help the search engines by breaking down a single page of material into several linked pages, 
each with its own information related to its own title (search engine experts disagree about how long 
pages ought to be, but they all talk about only a few hundred words as an ideal). Of course you need to 
balance this against making your visitors do too much clicking to get their information, but they also 
don’t want to be scrolling through ten screens’ worth of material.
Writing Useful Content
What you say on your web page is the key to visitor satisfaction and therefore to search engine rank-
ing. If you have high quality, relevant content, visitors will be happy and so will the search engines. But 
as I said earlier, search engines aren’t as sophisticated, so you need to structure your content in certain 
ways to ensure that they get the relevance.
In the eyes of search engines, the primary factor for the relevance of content is keywords. Starting with 
the words entered by a searcher, the search engines scan web page content to see how well it relates 
to those words — the keywords. The details of how search engines scan content for relevance var-
ies between search engines and over time as well — their algorithms are constantly being tweaked 
to achieve better results. However, here are some basic tips concerning keywords, which, even if they 
somehow stopped being helpful with rankings are still helpful to visitors:
Be consistent: If your title says the post is about all-inclusive resorts, don’t use the term full-service 
resorts in your content. Your visitor might understand that they’re the same, but you can’t take the 
chance that search engines will understand that. 
Use keywords early on: If the term all-inclusive resorts is in your title and yet doesn’t appear 
until your second or third paragraph, your visitors and the search engines may be excused for 
wondering if they’re reading the right page. Visitors may well continue on, but search engines 
are less forgiving.
Don’t hit people over the head: Visitors know from the title that the post is about all-inclusive 
resorts; it gets annoying to see the term in every single sentence. The search engine equivalent is 
to assume that the repetition is meant to trick it into seeing the page as relevant, and apart from 
lowering your ranking, such behavior, taken to an extreme, could get your page (or even your 
site) marked as spam.

236
Part VIII: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
As this last point suggests, relevant content is not simply about keywords. Search engine algorithms 
have become increasingly sophisticated over the years, and keyword density, as it’s called, is one of only 
several factors for which content is analyzed.
As long as you’re sticking to the topic, everything will be ﬁ ne, though you should keep in mind the point 
I made earlier about breaking up huge pages into smaller ones, each with very focused content. This can 
be helpful not only to your visitors, but it means that search engines can judge each of those pages on dif-
ferent criteria rather than trying to analyze vast amounts of text that range over several topics (no matter 
how relevant those topics may be). 
Never copy text from another site without quoting it and linking back to the site. 
Not only is it wrong, it's usually illegal to take content from elsewhere and claim 
it as your own (you'd be amazed at the number of people to whom this comes as a 
surprise). Always check the fair use and copyright laws for your country.
Keep in mind too, that search engines are becoming more sophisticated at spotting 
duplicate content and this can affect the ranking of pages; if your site is nothing 
but duplicate content it could even be blacklisted. 
There are also services that site owners can use to check for plagiarism on the web.
Linking Effectively
Search engines also determine the relevance of your site to someone’s search by looking at links from 
two perspectives: inbound and outbound. Inbound links are ones on other sites that point to your site 
and though these are very important to search engine rankings, they’re beyond the scope of this dis-
cussion. I’m concerned here with links in your posts that point to other sites. Search engines look in 
particular at two aspects of outbound links: relevance to the content of the post and the popularity of 
the site to which you’re linking.
When you’re creating links to other sites, always think of your visitors’ needs and you’re more likely to 
meet the standards of relevance. If the link promises to send me to a site with more information about 
great resorts in Jamaica and that site turns out to be a sales pitch for a time-share you’re afﬁ liated with, 
I will not be a happy visitor. What I read is what I want to get (if your link said I was going to ﬁ nd a 
great deal on a time-share, it would have been a relevant link).
In the popup link editor window of WordPress there’s a Title ﬁ eld. It’s good prac-
tice to enter a short description of what you’re linking to, even if it’s just the name 
of the site or the page. It’s useful for your visitors and it’s thought to have some role 
in search-engine ranking. 
Even when they’re relevant, you can help improve the value of your outbound links — both to visitors 
and to search engines — by doing a bit of research. If there are two very good sites and one ranks higher 

237
Lesson 30: Optimizing Your Content
in search results than the other, go with the higher-ranked site. Either site would be useful to your visitor, 
but the higher-ranked one may be given more weight by search engines. Of course you would put both 
sites in a links list, but I’m talking here about making choices within the text of a post — you don’t want 
to crowd the body with too many links or it gets a bit overwhelming.
Quite often you’ll also want to have links within posts that take visitors to other related material on 
your site. This is not only beneﬁ cial to visitors, but can be helpful with search rankings, though that 
seems to be the case only as your site gets more highly ranked.
Tagging Images
Search engines rely on two attributes of the HTML image tag to tell them something about the image. 
I’ve bolded those attributes in this sample code:
<img src=”http://yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg” title=”My New Car” 
alt=”Photo of my new Toyota Prius sitting in the driveway”>
It’s important that all your images have this descriptive text and in Lesson 13 I showed you the screens 
in WordPress where you can enter information for these attributes. Now look at these attributes with 
search engines in mind.
Title:
 
❑
 Titles should be very simple, leaving the details to the ALT attribute, and give the two or 
three keywords that describe the content of the image. Don’t load up the title with keywords 
that aren’t relevant to the immediate content. If the image is of a beach in Aruba, use “Beach in 
Aruba,” not “Caribbean travel deals on beaches in Aruba.” Your post may be about travel deals 
in the Caribbean, but that’s not what the image is about. Stick to the facts. Also, keep in mind 
that WordPress automatically uses your ﬁ le’s name for the Title ﬁ eld. Sometimes people think 
you have to stay with that, but you need to change it to a proper title. WordPress is just trying to 
make sure there’s something for the title.
Speaking of ﬁ lenames, search engines may give a bit of weight to names that con-
tain keywords for what’s in the image. So save the ﬁ le as aruba-beach.jpg instead 
of what comes out of your camera, like img39827.tif. The dash is important; don’t 
use an underscore because that can be misread by some search engines as no space 
at all: arubabeach.
Caption:
 
❑
 This is the name that WordPress gives to the content that’s put in the ALT attribute. 
Though you can have a lot of detail in here, again, you need to stick to the facts. Avoid putting 
non-relevant material, and don’t try to stuff the caption with keywords. For example, don’t say 
“Picture of a beach in Aruba. Beaches in Aruba tend to be less crowded than other Caribbean 
destinations. Aruba has a lot of great beaches. This beach is located in Northern Aruba.” Not 
only is it annoying to visitors, but you could get penalized by the search engines. However, do 
make sure you say Aruba if that’s a keyword for your post.

Part VIII: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
Try It
In this lesson you optimize one of your important posts or pages.
Lesson Requirements
A post or page with three or four paragraphs of text, some links, and an image. If possible, make it one 
that’s central to the theme of your website or blog.
Step-by-Step
How to optimize the content of a post.
 1. 
Open your post in the Edit Post screen.
2. 
Read through the post and in another program or on a piece of paper write a short sentence 
describing what the post is about. Set aside this summary for the moment.
 3. 
List two or three of the most important words or phrases in the post.
4. 
Ask yourself if these keywords are ones that people would use to search for the topic covered 
by your post.
 5. 
Do some research by entering those keywords into a search engine and see what comes back — are 
these sites related to yours? Ask friends, co-workers, or customers to do a search related to your site 
and note what keywords they use. Check online keyword tools such as Google’s (http://adwords 
.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal ) to get a sense of how people are using your key-
words and what possible alternatives might be.
6. 
Revise your list of keywords as necessary.
 7. 
Check the title of your post — does it use the most important of your keyword(s) and does it 
convey what that short sentence from step 2 conveyed?
8. 
Take the summary of your post that you wrote in step 2 and compare it with your opening 
paragraph. Does that paragraph clearly convey your summary? If not, rewrite it.
 9. 
Check that your opening paragraph uses the keywords you’ve come up with. If not, rewrite it.
10. 
Check the rest of the post to make sure your keywords appear several times in the text in a 
natural way. Rewrite as necessary.
 11. 
Check your links to make sure they’re going to useful, high-ranking sites (check the search engines 
to make sure those sites are coming up on the ﬁ rst page for their keywords).
12. 
Check that any images in the post have clear and accurate titles and captions, and, where appro-
priate, they use the keywords chosen earlier.
 13. 
Remember to update your post.

the enclosed DVD.

Optimizing Your Site 
as a Whole
In the previous lesson I talked about optimizing your content in ways that help increase your 
rankings in the search engines. Now it’s time to look at site-wide factors that affect how search 
engines rank you, and how to control them using WordPress.
Optimizing Admin Settings
The ﬁ rst setting you need to check is one I mentioned when installing WordPress, and that’s the 
Blog Visibility setting, found under Settings ➪ Privacy as shown in Figure 31-1. 
Figure 31-1

240
Part VIII: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
Right after installation, I suggested that Blog Visibility be turned off while you’re building your site, but 
now that you’re ﬁ nished, you need to make sure it’s turned on. 
Blog Visibility determines whether WordPress notiﬁ es a list of updating services that you have new 
content. You can ﬁ nd this list of services under Settings ➪ Writing. By default there is only service set 
up — Ping-O-Matic — but it covers over 20 of the major services for you, such as Technorati and Google 
Blog Search (for a full list visit http://pingomatic.com). You can add more services any time and 
this can be useful if there’s a specialized updating service that targets the audience you’re looking for. 
Another Admin Setting that’s very important is your Blog Title under Settings ➪ General. If you decide 
to use a graphic for the title of your blog in the header area, be sure to keep the Blog Title in your admin 
settings because, as I mentioned in Lesson 30, it’s used by WordPress when creating the title that appears 
at the top of your browser window, which in turn is used by search engines not only in calculating your 
ranking, but for display purposes in results pages. Make sure this title is the one people would use if 
they’re looking up your name.
One ﬁ nal admin setting that’s important is for comments, under Settings ➪ Discussion. Where appro-
priate on your site, make sure you allow comments. You can either enable them for the whole site and 
turn them off for speciﬁ c posts or pages, or you can leave them off and turn them on for speciﬁ c posts 
or pages. Allowing comments is an important part of making your website part of a wider community 
and encourages linking back and forth between sites.
Customizing Permalinks
I left permalinks as a separate section even though it’s an admin setting because it warrants a completely 
separate discussion of its own. In Lesson 25 I talked about setting permalinks through the Settings ➪ 
Permalinks screen, as well as editing permalinks for individual posts. I was concerned in that lesson 
with how people link to your site, and now I want to discuss permalinks with respect to search engines.
The ﬁ rst point to make is that links from other sites (inbound links) are very important to search engines, 
as long as the link is from a quality, popular site. It would be shame to have a link from a trusted site and 
to suddenly have that link broken because you changed something in the URL of your page. Permalinks 
are designed to prevent that problem.
The second point about links and search engines is that the wording of the URL may have some effect on 
the ranking for the page that the URL points to. I say it “may” because there’s an ongoing debate about 
this in the SEO community, but I’m not going to get into the merits of either view. My take on it is that, as 
a visitor, I prefer a URL that says something about where I’m being taken over one that tells me I’m going 
to /index.php?p=45. So from that standpoint I’m in the custom permalink camp for WordPress, choos-
ing a setting that has the name of the post in the permalink.
If you do choose permalinks that contain the title of the post, remember what I talked about with respect to 
titles: keep them clear and succinct. Doing that will avoid permalinks such as http://www.yourdomain 
.com/testimonials/our-favorite-spot-in-aruba-for-dining-and-dancing-all-night-long. 
If you do ﬁ nd the need for titles that become short stories, at least tidy up and shorten the permalink by 
editing it. You’ll ﬁ nd the permalink edit button just below the post title, next to the permalink itself (but 
only if you have custom permalinks set; you won’t see it with the default permalink setting).

241
Lesson 31: Optimizing Your Site as a Whole
Naming Categories
Just as giving posts useful titles is important for search engines, so is proper naming of categories. The 
key here is to be as speciﬁ c as you can: use Scuba Diving and not just Diving. 
Remember how I named my Island Travel subcategories? Instead of Testimonials ➪ Aruba, I used Testimonials 
➪ Aruba Testimonials so it wouldn’t be confused with Destinations ➪ Aruba. Aruba Testimonials is more 
descriptive of my category anyway, so it helps with visitors and search engines knowing where they are and 
what to expect from the content.
You can of course change the wording that permalinks use for categories, by going to Posts ➪ Categories 
and editing the category slug. Again, be careful not to change things once the category has started being 
used or you run the risk of breaking any links that had been created in the meantime.
Using Meta and Title Tags
It used to be that everyone was worried about something called meta tags — if you don’t have the right 
meta tags, the search engines won’t index you properly. The meta tags for keywords and descriptions still 
play a role in search-engine ranking, but to a far lesser extent. Of the two, the description is more important 
because it often gets used in search results as the one or two lines you see under the link’s title.
If you look at the source code or the header ﬁ le for a new WordPress installation, you’ll see that neither the 
meta description nor the meta keywords are included in the coding. You’re best off installing a plugin to 
manage them so that you can have unique descriptions for individual posts (I talk about such plugins in 
Lesson 37). If you simply put a meta description in the header.php ﬁ le, it will be the same for every post 
and that’s not a good thing from a search engine standpoint because it looks like you have duplicate content.
In the previous lesson I talked about the importance of useful titles for posts and how most themes use 
the post title for the title tag of the HTML page. That title tag is used by search engines, not only for 
understanding what the page is about, but also as the lead line of a site’s listing in search results.
If your theme only shows the title of your website in the title tag that’s not good because to the search 
engines it will look like every page is about the same topic. At the very least you should replace the 
entire title tag in your header.php template ﬁ le with this: <title><?php wp_title(); ?> - <?php 
bloginfo(‘name’); ?></title>. That way, the title of the particular post will be what search 
engines (and your visitors) see ﬁ rst. The best solution, though would be to install an SEO plugin that 
allows you to have title tags that are more descriptive than the actual titles of the posts.
Try It
In this lesson you check the names of your existing categories for their search engine friendliness.
Lesson Requirements
At least a few categories for your posts.

242
Part VIII: Becoming Search Engine Friendly
Step-by-Step
How to make your category names more search engine friendly.
1. 
Go to Posts ➪ Categories.
 2. 
Look over your categories with search engines in mind. Do the category names accurately iden-
tify the content you’re putting into the categories? Even if a category name is accurate, is that 
the most likely term that people would use to search for that content? Could you separate a cat-
egory into two or more categories (either at the same level or as subcategories) to better separate 
the content into topics that people might search for independently?
3. 
Before changing any category name, consider how long you’ve had your site, whether you have 
a lot of people linking to that category, and whether you have a permalink structure that uses 
category names, because changing the name will change the URL for that category.
 4. 
If you do change a category’s name, remember to change the name of the category slug as well 
(lowercase with dashes between words).

the enclosed DVD.

Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
Lesson 32: How is Your Site Doing?
Lesson 33: Keeping Up to Date
Lesson 34: Backing Up Your Site


How Is Your Site Doing?
Knowing how many people are visiting your site, what they’re doing while they’re there, and 
who’s linking to your site are all important for tracking the success of your site and knowing how 
to move forward with it. Some of this is done by WordPress and some of it you’ll need outside help 
with — I cover both in this lesson.
Comments are obviously a very direct way of knowing how people are feeling about your site 
and you can use those comments to understand how to improve your site. If you get a lot of com-
ments on a particular topic, that’s a pretty sure sign that you should be talking about that topic 
regularly, and vice versa. No single piece of data is certain of course, but when you add them all 
up they can give you a pretty sophisticated picture of how you’re doing and where you should be 
going in the future.
Monitoring Pingbacks and Incoming Links
On the WordPress Dashboard you’ll ﬁ nd two quick ways to ﬁ nd out who’s linking to your site: 
the Comments area showing pingbacks and trackbacks, and the Incoming Links box.
Pingbacks and Trackbacks
In Lesson 25 you learned how to enable pingbacks and trackbacks — two distinct ways of being 
notiﬁ ed that others are linking to your content. Now it’s time to monitor them.
WordPress treats both as if they’re comments. You can moderate pingbacks and trackbacks, 
including marking them as spam. In the case of trackbacks you can also edit the excerpt from the 
other website, just as you can edit the comments that people leave.
How valuable are trackbacks and pingbacks? Aside from the ones that are spam — that’s why 
moderating is important — they each have their advantages for knowing how you’re doing. 

246
Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
Trackbacks are good because they provide a short snippet of what the other site was saying when 
it linked to you. Although pingbacks don’t show any content, they’re considered a bit more reliable 
because they happen automatically when someone links (a person could create a trackback to your 
site without actually linking to you).
Incoming Links
If pingbacks and trackbacks tell you someone is linking to your site, what’s the purpose of the Incoming 
Links box highlighted in Figure 32-1?
Figure 32-1
The answer is that pingbacks and trackbacks work only on individual posts, and only if you and the 
person linking to you both have the functions turned on. The value of Incoming Links is that it displays 
a list of who’s linking to your site in general, a speciﬁ c page, or an individual post — whether or not 
trackbacks and pingbacks are functioning.
By default, the Incoming Links box checks for your website’s address on Google Blog Search, but you 
can change that if you’d prefer to monitor your site in another blog search engine such as Technorati. 
Mouseover the right-hand side of the Incoming Links title and you’ll see a link called Conﬁ gure, which 
creates the box highlighted in Figure 32-2.
You’ll see the form asking you to enter the RSS feed URL. Just paste it in, choose how many items to 
display, and click Submit.

247
Lesson 32: How Is Your Site Doing?
Figure 32-2
Don’t be discouraged if nothing is showing in your Incoming Links box when you ﬁ rst set up a site. It 
will take some time to get people to link to you. This is also one way to monitor if your link-building 
program is working.
Monitoring Site Statistics
There is no built-in statistics system for WordPress, but you have a number of choices for ﬁ nding out 
detailed information on who’s visiting your site.
The simplest method is to use the statistics provided by your hosting company. It will have at least one 
package — such as Webalizer or AWstats — that will give you lots of details about your site visitors. 
Sometimes you can access these stats through a URL or you may need to go through your web hosting 
panel (like Plesk or cPanel). Check the host’s knowledge base for instructions on accessing stats.
Another option is to use the statistics system at WordPress.com — the hosted version of WordPress. You 
can do this through a plugin called, not surprisingly, WordPress.com Stats. In the video for this lesson, I 
show you the statistics generated by this plugin, but to get this particular plugin to work, you’ll need to 
sign up at WordPress.com — just to get an account; you don’t need to create a blog.
With the WordPress.com username you can get a special code called the API Key, and then you just 
enter that into the WordPress.com Stats plugin. 
You’ll also need this same WordPress API Key to activate the anti-spam plugin called Akismet 
(it comes preloaded on all WordPress installations).
Other statistics plugins for WordPress keep track of statistics using a database, and though some of 
them are very good, they’re one more thing to maintain on your site. The WordPress.com statistics are 
all handled for you with no maintenance required.
Whichever of these options you use for statistics, it’s a good idea to put Google Analytics on your 
site as well. This completely free and comprehensive service can be set up very quickly. Even if you 

248
Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
don’t already have a Google account, signing up for one is fast (at the top right corner of the Google 
home page click Sign In and look for the Don’t Have An Account? link). Then you can create a Google 
Analytics section of your account, where simple instructions produce a piece of code that you then 
paste into the footer.php template of your theme. If that sounds complicated, it’s not.
Assuming you’ve copied the code from Google, all you have to do is go to Appearance ➪ Editor and 
select the footer.php ﬁ le from your theme. At the very bottom of the ﬁ le, you’ll see the closing body 
tag </body> and when you paste in the code just before that tag, the ﬁ le looks like Figure 32-3.
Figure 32-3
Remember to click Update File. The code is now active on your site. You can double-check by refreshing 
your site in your browser and looking at the source code (right-click and choose View Source). You’ll also 
need to check that Google is ﬁ nding the code — simply follow Google Analytics’ veriﬁ cation instruc-
tions, at which point the statistics will start ﬂ owing.

In this lesson you practice changing the blog search URL for Incoming Links.
Lesson Requirements
No special requirements, just some familiarity with using search engines.

249
Lesson 32: How Is Your Site Doing?
Step-by-Step
How to change the RSS feed monitored in Incoming Links.
1. 
Go to the Dashboard in WordPress and ﬁ nd the Incoming Links box.
 2. 
Mouseover the right-hand side of the Incoming Links header until you see the link appear.
3. 
Click Conﬁ gure and you’ll see the conﬁ guration form.
 4. 
Go to your favorite blog search engine — such as search.technorati.com or 
www.icerocket.com.
5. 
Do a search for your domain name.
 6. 
Look for the RSS feed link somewhere on the page (it often says Subscribe and shows the 
orange RSS icon).
7. 
Right-click the RSS link.
 8. 
Choose Copy Link Location.
9. 
Back in WordPress, paste the link into the Incoming Links URL ﬁ eld of the Conﬁ gure box. 
 10. 
Choose the number of results you want to show.
11. 
Decide whether you want to display the date.
 12. 
Click Submit.
13. 
If you have people linking to your site, the Incoming Links box should now show the most 
recent ones.

the enclosed DVD.


Keeping Up to Date
Like any software, WordPress is constantly being improved — more features, better speed, 
increased security, and so on — as are the themes and plugins. Fortunately, keeping them all up 
to date is pretty straightforward. 
Why should you update? I’ve seen WordPress sites still happily running on Version 2.0. The only 
trouble is, some security holes have since been plugged and that’s the number one reason for 
updating. Having access to new features and a better interface (there’s no comparison between 
the admin screen of Version 2 and Version 2.8) are the other reasons for keeping up. Also, the 
longer you leave an update, the greater the chance of problems because over time the database 
structure can change signiﬁ cantly, and trying to make all those changes at one sitting may be 
impossible (at least with an automated update).
On the other hand, rushing to do a new update is not always advisable either. Despite vigorous 
testing, we all know that software can still come to market with minor or even major bugs that 
should be ﬁ xed. It isn’t until they’re released that these problems may present themselves, so it 
can be wise to wait a few weeks after a new update, unless of course the bug is so major that your 
site is at risk.
Updating WordPress
Even at its most difﬁ cult — a manual update — keeping WordPress current is a fairly simple task. 
Since Version 2.7, WordPress has featured a built-in automated update, and plugins that automate 
the process are available for earlier versions. I’ll go through both options in a moment, but ﬁ rst a 
word about how you know when to update.

252
Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
WordPress is very clear about the availability of updates. A warning message with a link to perform the 
update is displayed at the top of every admin screen until the update is completed. If you’re logged in as 
any role other than Administrator, the message tells you to notify your administrator of the update. Also, 
an Update button appears on the Dashboard if there’s an update available — it will be next to the name 
of the version you’re running.
If you don’t regularly make changes to your site’s content, you may not see the update message for 
many weeks. In that case, it might be good to join the update notiﬁ cations list at WordPress.org.
Automated Update
As of WordPress 2.7, the updating process became automated within the admin panel. If you have an 
earlier version, there’s a good plugin called Wordpress [sic] Automated Upgrade and it functions from 
Version 1.5.2 and up.
The key with any update is to make sure you have your site backed up — as you see in the next lesson, 
you’ll want to be doing this regularly anyway. Fortunately, WordPress reminds you to do the backup 
before proceeding with the automated update, as shown in Figure 33-1.
Figure 33-1
Once you click Upgrade Automatically, you’ll see a list of tasks displayed one by one as WordPress per-
forms them. At the conclusion, the screen will look like Figure 33-2.

253
Lesson 33: Keeping Up to Date
Figure 33-2
That last line tells you the update has worked.
Manual Update
If for some reason you want to manually update WordPress you certainly can. 
There isn’t enough room here to go into the details of a manual update because there are a lot of variables. 
WordPress.org has a handy three-step manual updating process — http://codex.wordpress .org/
Upgrading_WordPress — but even with that it warns you that you may need even more details on its 
extended upgrade instructions page — http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress_Extended.
As with the automated update, it’s important to do a backup of both the database and the entire set of 
WordPress ﬁ les and folders on your server. The other crucial element of a manual update is to know 
which ﬁ les you can’t overwrite and which themselves may need to be manually changed, saved, and 
uploaded again. The WordPress site helps you with all of that.
Troubleshooting WordPress Updates
The two most common problems encountered in the automated update are that the server is not con-
ﬁ gured to allow the automated update and the plugins or themes are not compatible with the updated 
version of WordPress.

254
Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
If you’re getting error messages saying WordPress does not have permission to perform the automated 
upgrade, you’ll either have to change permissions or get your hosting company to do that for you, or 
you’ll need to do the manual upgrade.
If the installation itself goes ﬁ ne but there are problems with the site, it’s likely that one of the existing 
plugins needs updating or, if there is no update for it, you’ll need to disable it for the time being. It’s 
also possible that your theme needs to be updated, which I cover in the ﬁ nal section of this lesson.
In the case of a manual update, a common problem is deleting the wp-config.php ﬁ le. You’ll know it’s 
no longer there if you get database connection errors. Simply go to your backup ﬁ les and reload it.
Updating Plugins
Just as you receive a warning message that a new version of WordPress is available, you also receive 
notices for plugins. The most visible notice from any screen in the admin area is a tiny graphic dis-
played on your menu, as highlighted on the left of Figure 33-3.
Figure 33-3
The number in the graphic tells you how many plugins need updating. Figure 33-3 shows the Manage 
Plugins screen and if you click the Upgrade Available ﬁ lter at the top right you’ll see just the plugins 
that need an update. The update information is clearly marked in the colored stripe, with links to the 
plugin details or to automatically upgrade.
When you automatically upgrade a plugin, you’ll see a screen very similar to the WordPress upgrade, 
with each item in the process appearing as it’s completed. What you want to see at the bottom of the list 
is the phrase Plugin reactivated successfully. Then you’re done.

255
Lesson 33: Keeping Up to Date
If you’re experiencing problems after a WordPress update, but none of your plugins shows an update avail-
able, you may need to troubleshoot by deactivating plugins until you ﬁ nd the one causing the trouble. Once 
you know which it is, you can click through to the plugin’s homepage and see if there’s an update that got 
missed. You may ﬁ nd that the plugin author is still working on an update or is no longer supporting the 
plugin. In either case, you’ll need to deactivate the plugin. You can always update and reactivate later if the 
author makes a new version.
Updating or Installing New Themes
Like plugins, themes may need updating for various reasons. It could be that they have a special func-
tionality that relied on something in WordPress that has now changed. Or the new version of the theme 
takes advantage of new features in WordPress. In either case, you’ll need to perform an update.
With some themes, the update happens automatically when you update WordPress. For others you’ll need 
to go to the theme’s homepage (there’s a link in the theme library listing) and see if there’s a new version 
available. If there is, you download the folder and then upload it to your themes directory of wp-content.
Installing a New Theme
There may come a time when you’d like to change to a new theme. If you haven’t customized the cur-
rent theme at all, the switch is pretty easy. You just go to Appearance ➪ Add New Themes and you can 
browse through the WordPress directory of free themes. The nice part is you can ﬁ lter the search with 
a wide variety of parameters, such as number of columns, color schemes, features like custom header, 
and so on. Select the themes you want and they’ll appear in your library of available themes under 
Appearance ➪ Themes.
If you decide that one of these new themes should replace your current theme, you simply activate it from 
the Manage Themes screen. There’s a thumbnail screenshot to remind you of what the theme looks like, 
but you can also preview what your site will look like in the theme by clicking Preview. When you’re ready, 
click Activate and the new theme instantly replaces the old. 
Remember, if you had any customizations in your original theme, such as page templates, they won’t be 
there in the new theme unless you explicitly added them to the new theme’s folder.
If you’re buying a theme or getting a customized one, you’ll need to manually upload its folder to the 
theme folder of your wp-content folder. Then go to Appearance ➪ Themes and you should see the new 
theme in the listings, ready for preview or activation.
Keep in mind that all themes are different. Even if you didn’t customize your old theme, it may have 
been able to do things that your new theme can’t, and vice versa. Watch that parts of your site aren’t 
relying on something that’s no longer available.
Try It
It’s difﬁ cult to practice an update unless your WordPress installation actually needs updating, so in this 
lesson you learn how to ﬁ nd and install a new theme (you won’t actually be changing your theme).

Click Appearance ➪ Themes to double-check that the new theme is listed in your theme library. 
Remember that installing a theme only puts it in your theme library, it does not activate the 
theme and make it live on your site.

Backing Up Your Site
There’s nothing more devastating in the world of computing than not having a backup of your 
data when something goes wrong, and the same is true on the Web. Hard drives die on web serv-
ers and even the most sophisticated server backup systems are vulnerable to human error or acts 
of nature.
Your hosting company may offer automated backups, but double-check exactly 
what that means. If it’s just your WordPress database, it’s only half a backup. If all 
necessary WordPress ﬁ les are getting backed up, be sure that you can get access to 
those backups and download them to your computer for additional safety.
A Backup Routine
Here’s one simple routine for backing up your WordPress site. In the folder on your hard drive 
where you have anything relating to your site, create a new folder called My Site Back-ups. Then 
pick a time each month (more frequently if you’re constantly adding new content) when you’re 
going to stop for a moment and back up your site.
Each time you do the backup, create a new folder in My Site Back-ups using a dating system such 
as 20090617 (year-month-day). Usually you’ll just want the most recent backup and this naming 
system makes it easy to ﬁ nd, but also if you need to restore the site from an earlier time.
Backing up WordPress is a two-step process, so in this 20090617 folder you’re going to have two 
subfolders: one for the database backup and one for the web server ﬁ les. The following sections 
look at how you get the material for each of these.

258
Part IX: Housekeeping Chores
Backing Up Your Web Server Files
When you FTP into your web server, what you’ll see will vary to some extent depending on what exactly 
you have on your website. If it’s entirely contained within WordPress, you’re going to see a ﬁ le structure 
much like that shown in Figure 34-1.
Figure 34-1
The simplest routine is to download everything you see in this root directory. Some will argue that 
you really only need to do this once (unless you upgrade your WordPress, in which case you’d need 
to do another download) and then on your regular backup routine, all you need to back up is the folder 
called wp-content. The reason they say this is because it’s the wp-content folder that contains every-
thing unique to your installation of WordPress: themes, plugins, and media ﬁ les. WordPress ﬁ les out-
side of wp-content don’t change (the wp-config.php ﬁ le could change if you switch databases or 
something).
Here’s my argument in favor of backing up the entire root directory of your website: 
 1. 
It doesn’t take up much time or space to download all the ﬁ les.
 2. 
A full backup keeps all ﬁ les together rather than having wp-content backups in one place and 
the core WordPress ﬁ les elsewhere.
 3. 
If you have to move to a new server, it’s just simpler to upload everything at once without hav-
ing to think about anything (except making sure your wp-config.php ﬁ le is accessing the new 
database with the right passwords, and so on).
It’s up to you, but at the very minimum you must back up the wp-content folder in your backup routine.

259
Lesson 34: Backing Up Your Site
Backing Up Your Database
The other half of your backup routine involves the database where WordPress stores your written con-
tent and the settings that control, among other things, the relationships between your content (catego-
ries and so on). WordPress uses a MySQL database so you can use any method that backs up a database 
of that type. The most common interface provided by hosting companies is called phpMyAdmin and it 
provides a pretty user-friendly interface for managing databases, including doing backups.
I won’t go into the details of the process here — you can ﬁ nd lots of good resources online if you look 
up “phpmyadmin backup.” Always make sure you’re reading instructions for your version of phpMy-
Admin. Using the Export function, the most important points are to ensure that you’re backing up all 
the database tables, that you choose SQL as the output format, and that you use Save As File. You would 
save that ﬁ le to the database folder in the backup folder I talked earlier about creating.
If your hosting company has an automated database backup feature, you can use that too, again making 
sure it’s backed up in the right way. Have the company e-mail the backup to you, or it may be available 
on its site for you to download or placed in folder on your site and you can download it from there. 
Again, you want to have a copy on your computer.
Under Tools ➪ Export you’ll ﬁ nd a feature of WordPress that appears to do what a database backup 
does, but it’s quite different. This feature extracts all the content from your database and preserves ele-
ments of the structure in a language called XML, but it is not a full database backup. The ﬁ le generated 
is meant to be imported back into a WordPress installation, and as long as the version of WordPress is 
the same as the one from which you exported, things go pretty smoothly. Still, I wouldn’t recommend 
this as your primary backup, especially not when plugins are available to make full backups very simple.
Some Database Backup Plugins
Simplicity and automation are two advantages to using plugins to manage your WordPress database 
backups. It’s that latter one I ﬁ nd particularly helpful. As easy as the routine is that I just showed you, 
it’s just as easy to forget to do it. Plugins can help by doing the backup at a speciﬁ ed time, over and over 
again. However, not all plugins perform the same tasks, so you’ll want to check out the options. I have 
a couple of plugin suggestions here, but new ones are always being added at www.wordpress.org/
extend/plugins.
WP-DBManager is a very powerful database management plugin that has a number of the features you 
ﬁ nd in phpMyAdmin, and backing up is just one of them. However the backup function is much sim-
pler and it not only keeps a copy on the server, but it allows you to e-mail any or all of the backups to 
yourself or some other location. It also has automatic scheduling of backups, e-mailed wherever you 
want. Another useful feature is the ability to easily restore a backup copy of your database.
WP-DB-Backup is a very straightforward plugin whose only job is to back up your database. By default, 
the plugin backs up only the core WordPress database tables, but you can choose to include any other 
tables (it gives you a list) that are used by plugins. There is also a scheduling feature.
If you’re not comfortable working with an FTP program, there are also plugins that automate the back-
ing up of your wp-content ﬁ les, such as Wordpress [sic] Backup.

Because many options for database backup exist, in this lesson you focus on practicing backing up your 
WordPress ﬁ les.
Lesson Requirements
FTP program and access to your hosting account.
Step-by-Step
How to backup your WordPress ﬁ les.
 1. 
Open your FTP program.
2. 
Log in to your server.
 3. 
In the window showing your computer, ﬁ nd or create your Backups folder and then create a 
folder with today’s date, for example, 20090703, and in that folder create another folder called 
WordPress Files.
4. 
In the server-side window, navigate until you ﬁ nd the wp- ﬁ les (these may be in your root web 
directory — www or public_html, for example — or they may be in a subdirectory that you cre-
ated specially for WordPress).
 5. 
Select all the ﬁ les in the directory that has the WordPress ﬁ les (it doesn’t matter if some of them 
aren’t part of WordPress — they’re part of your site).
6. 
Click Download (or the down arrow).
 7. 
All the ﬁ les on the right should now also be in the window at the left (your WordPress Files folder).
8. 
Disconnect from your server and shut down your FTP program.

Lesson 35: Installing and Activating Plugins
Lesson 36: Example Plugins
Lesson 37: Ten Other Common Uses for Plugins
Lesson 38: Extending WordPress Even Further


Installing and 
Activating Plugins
There are a lot of things that WordPress doesn’t do, and that’s a good thing. The simpler the base, 
the more secure, the more bug-free, and the more efﬁ cient it can be. It’s also easier to update a 
simple structure. But you’ll probably want WordPress to do more, and that’s where plugins ﬁ t in, 
so to speak.
In this lesson you learn about ﬁ nding, installing, and activating plugins. Lesson 37 provides a 
quick guide to help you sort through the more than 6,500 plugins available — in the few days I 
was working on this chapter, more than 150 plugins were added to the directory!
What Is a Plugin?
Plugins are scripts that provide additional functionality to WordPress by using a combination of 
built-in WordPress code and new code. Plugins vary in complexity from a half page of script to 
folders with dozens of scripts and database tables.
Most plugins are open-source and available at no charge from thousands of individuals who often 
develop a feature for their own site and then share it with the WordPress community. Most plugin 
authors accept donations or have wish lists, and I strongly encourage everyone to send even a few 
dollars their way to help compensate for the incredible amount of time and talent they devote.
One of the best things about plugins is that you can unplug them. That’s important because it 
helps protect the base of your website, by keeping the plugins separate from the core WordPress 
ﬁ les. If something goes wrong with a plugin, either because of a conﬂ ict with other plugins or 
when you update WordPress, all you have to do is deactivate it.

264
Part X: Extending WordPress
Finding Plugins
The best place to go for plugins is Plugins ➪ Add New. That’s because WordPress has a built-in search 
function that imports data directly from the WordPress.org plugins directory. The handy thing about 
this directory is that it tells you how many people have downloaded a plugin and users are given a 
chance to rate the plugin. Plugin authors are also good about updating this directory with the latest 
versions of their offering.
The search screen on the Install Plugins page offers a whole range of options for ﬁ nding plugins, as you 
can see in Figure 35-1.
Figure 35-1
The menu at the top not only allows you to see a list of Featured, Popular, Newest, or Recently Updated 
plugins, but you can also Upload a plugin you may have previously downloaded to your hard drive.
The search function below that menu enables you to use keywords, author names, or tags to ﬁ nd plugins, 
and the Popular Tags cloud at the bottom of the screen gives a quick overview of what tags plugin authors 
have used to describe their contribution.
I’ll do a search for “backup” and you can see the results in Figure 35-2.
All the data you’re seeing is exactly what you would get if you went to WordPress.org and did that search, 
but one advantage is that you’re shown a longer description here.

265
Lesson 35: Installing and Activating Plugins
Figure 35-2
One thing that’s missing from the search function here or at the WordPress site is the ability to sort the 
results. You can’t display according to the number of downloads or the number of people who’ve rated 
the plugin. It’s also important to try a few different keywords to make sure you’ve found all possible 
plugins for a topic. It depends how the author wrote the description, and sometimes I ﬁ nd that even the 
most basic keyword is missing, so I need to hunt around using variations.
In terms of what to look for in the search results, I use three criteria for judging multiple plugins that 
meet my feature requirements: the number of downloads, how many people have voted for it, and how 
recently it’s been updated. You’ll get a feel for weighing these three criteria. For instance, a plugin that 
has 40,000 downloads, 150 votes, and has been around for 5 years is likely going to be trumped by a 
plugin that only has 5,000 downloads, but just came out a month ago and already has 80 votes. The fact 
that the newer plugin has received half as many votes in a very short time suggests it will be better, 
plus being more recent, it may take advantage of current developments in WordPress, not to mention 
JavaScript and PHP. 
You can learn more about a plugin by seeing what others are saying about it in the WordPress forums. 
If you click on the name of the plugin you’ll be taken to the plugin’s page on WordPress.org and over on 
the right-hand side you’ll see the most recent forum references, if there are any. Some plugins have their 
own user forums, and you can ﬁ nd those by going to a plugin’s home page — if one exists it will be on 
the right-hand side of the plugin’s page in the WordPress directory. Finally, WordPress users around 
the Web also love to share lists and reviews of their favorite plugins, so you can pick up lots of tips from 
those sites as well.

266
Part X: Extending WordPress
Installing and Activating Plugins
Like any software, there’s a difference between installing and activating plugins. When you install a 
plugin you’re really just uploading it into the plugins folder of your wp-content folder. You can do 
that manually using your FTP program or the built-in installer that’s part of the WordPress admin 
functions.
Automated installs are as simple as clicking Install next to the plugin you’ve chosen from the search 
list. The WordPress installer tells you when you’re successful and you can verify that by going to 
Plugins ➪ Installed. The screen shown in Figure 35-3 tells you a number of things at a glance.
Figure 35-3
White rows are the active plugins, gray are installed but not active, and the colored bar on a row reminds 
you visually and textually that there’s an update available for that plugin, with a link to do the update 
automatically.
You can also ﬁ lter what you see on this Manage Plugins screen by using the menu at the top left. You 
can see All, Active, Recently Active, Inactive, or Upgrade Available (options display only if there are 
plugins that meet their criteria).
Because I work with WordPress a lot, I like to download commonly used plugins 
from the WordPress site and keep copies on my computer so they’re easy to ﬁ nd.
If you need an earlier version of a plugin, you can ﬁ nd them archived in the WordPress.org Plugin 
Directory. Go to the plugin’s page and at the top right, under the current version number you’ll ﬁ nd a link 

267
Lesson 35: Installing and Activating Plugins
to Other Versions. On one occasion, after updating WordPress and all the plugins, I found that one of the 
plugins wasn’t working. Re-installing an earlier version got it working again.
Troubleshooting Plugins
As I mentioned before, the two most common reasons for having trouble with plugins are conﬂ icts 
between plugins or conﬂ icts between an updated version of WordPress and an older plugin.
The great thing is that ﬁ nding the problem plugin(s) and halting the problems on your live site is made 
fairly easy by the nature of plugins — you just start deactivating them one at time.
If your problem started with the activation of a new plugin, systematically deactivate each of the other 
plugins starting with the most recently activated. 
If your problem began right after updating WordPress, ﬁ rst of all, make sure that you’ve updated every 
plugin. One of the reasons for not updating WordPress immediately upon release is that you want to 
give plugin authors a bit of time to come out with their updates (they’re usually pretty good about bring-
ing those out at the same time). With a major update of WordPress, you should see a lot of plugin update 
notices.
Once all the updates are done, if the problem still persists check the homepages for any plugins that did 
not have an update. There may be a notice there saying there’s a delay or the plugin is no longer sup-
ported, or there may be notices about conﬂ icts with other plugins.
Resolving the problem can be as simple as updating one or more plugins, but it may also be that there is 
no current ﬁ x and you either have to pay someone to ﬁ x the bugs on one or more plugins or, at the very 
least, do without that functionality until the problem can be solved.
Try It
In this lesson you learn to ﬁ nd a plugin, install it, and activate it.
Lesson Requirements
No special requirements.
Step-by-Step
In the next lesson, one of the plugins I show you in some detail is Contact Form 7, so let’s ﬁ nd, install, 
and activate it. 
 1. 
Go to Plugins ➪ Add New.
 2. 
Do a search for Contact Form 7. It should come up as the second result or at least somewhere 
near the top. Look for the author Takayuki Miyoshi at the end of the description.

268
Part X: Extending WordPress
 3. 
Click Install over on the right side.
 4. 
In the resulting popup window, click Install Now.
 5. 
In the Installing Plugin screen, if things are successful, you’ll see a link at the bottom to Activate 
Plugin; click that.
 6. 
You’ll be taken to the Manage Plugins screen and you should see Contact Form 7 as a white row 
indicating that it’s active. Also, on the admin menu you should see the heading “Contact” near 
the very bottom of the menu.
 7. 
If you don’t want this plugin, you can delete it later, but keep it for the next lesson at least so 
that you can try out some of the functionality.
To see some of the examples from this lesson, watch the video for Lesson 35 on 
the enclosed DVD.

Example Plugins
Although every WordPress plugin performs different functions and operates differently, you can 
get a general sense of how they all operate by seeing a couple in action, and that’s what this les-
son is about.
I’ve installed two plugins on the Island Travel site that I think would be useful: NextGEN Gallery 
to manage photos and Contact Form 7 to help me easily create contact forms. In the next lesson I 
cover ten more uses for plugins and give some recommendations for those as well.
Photo Gallery Plugin — NextGEN Gallery
The most popular (more than one million downloads) and the most powerful photo management 
plugin is called NextGEN Gallery. Developed by Alex Rabe, this highly conﬁ gurable plugin goes 
well beyond the image gallery function built into WordPress. I’ll barely be able to scratch the sur-
face of its capabilities, but you’ll have a good sense what’s possible.
When you activate NextGEN a special section is created on the admin menu, as you can see at 
the lower left of Figure 36-1 (immediately above it is a menu section created by the second sample 
plugin, Contact Form 7, which you will have seen already if you installed that plugin as part of 
the previous lesson’s Try It section).
You can also see from this opening screen of NextGEN that it has its own kind of Dashboard 
showing you how many images you have, how many galleries and albums (I explain them in 
a moment), as well as a lot of technical details about your server settings and server graphics 
capabilities. You don’t need to concern yourself with these details, but they’re handy if a technical 
issue arises and someone on the WordPress forums asks you what your PHP Max Post Size is!

270
Part X: Extending WordPress
Figure 36-1
In the top-left box of the NextGEN Gallery Overview you’ll see a button that says Upload Pictures. 
The name is a little misleading because clicking it takes you to the screen shown in the top half of 
Figure 36-2.
Figure 36-2

271
Lesson 36: Example Plugins
Instead of uploading images it’s asking you to Add New Gallery. But if you look at the menu at the top, 
you’ll see Upload Images over on the right — clicking that gives you the screen shown on the bottom 
half of Figure 36-2.
Notice that you’re asked to upload an image into a gallery. All images have to be in at least one gallery, 
so before uploading your ﬁ rst image, you’ll need to have created at least one gallery. I’ll do that now for 
a gallery featuring beaches in Jamaica. I enter the name in the New Gallery ﬁ eld and click Add Gallery. 
I get a success message, as shown in Figure 36-3:
Figure 36-3
Now that I have a gallery, I can upload some pictures. NextGEN allows you to choose multiple ﬁ les to 
upload a time (or entire folders through a separate upload window). Figure 36-4 shows that I’ve selected 
three images to upload, and I have a choice of removing them individually before clicking Upload Images. 
If you forget to choose a gallery from the drop down menu, a warning message pops up and you’ll have to 
select all the images again.
Figure 36-4
As each image uploads, there’s a progress bar across the top of the screen and when everything is done 
you’ll get a success message stating how many images were uploaded.

272
Part X: Extending WordPress
Once the images are uploaded to the gallery, there are powerful tools for managing them. I’ve combined 
a couple of screenshots in Figure 36-5 to show you as many of the features as possible at one time.
Figure 36-5
If you mouseover an image’s thumbnail, a text menu appears, allowing you to View the full image, read 
any metadata contained in the image, Edit the thumbnail, or Delete the image. There are text ﬁ elds for 
you to give the image a title and description as well as any tags. There’s a checkbox to exclude an image, 
which means that it won’t show when you display the gallery as a whole.
The drop-down menu near the top of the screen shows you the wide range of actions that can be applied 
to one or many images all at one time. You could copy them to another gallery, give them a watermark, 
add tags, and much more.
With a gallery created and some images uploaded, here’s how to get materials from NextGEN into your 
posts. The left side of Figure 36-6 shows the button bar in Visual mode of the Text Editor, with the NextGEN 
button highlighted. 
Figure 36-6
When you click on that button, you get a popup window, as shown on the right side of Figure 36-6. 
From there you can choose to insert any image, gallery or album from NextGEN.

273
Lesson 36: Example Plugins
How exactly do galleries and albums differ in NextGen? Galleries are the smallest groups of images, 
whereas albums are ways of grouping several galleries or a mix of galleries and other albums.
So in the case of Island Travel, I might set up a series of galleries — Kingston, Jamaica Beaches, Jamaica 
Food — then group them together under an album called Jamaica. I then group the album Jamaica with 
the album Aruba, and so on, under a single album called Caribbean. Or I could group all beach galler-
ies under a single album called Caribbean Beaches.
The drag-and-drop interface for moving galleries and albums is very intuitive, as you can see in 
Figure 36-7.
Figure 36-7
This powerful organizational capability, coupled with the ability to do things like automatically match 
up your images with WordPress tags or categories, allow different access to NextGEN functions based 
on WordPress user roles (Admin, Editor, and so on), and the ease with which you get fancy JavaScript 
or Flash slideshows makes NextGEN a must-have plugin for any image-intensive WordPress site.
Form Creation Plugin — Contact Form 7
WordPress does not have a form creation tool built-in, so a number of developers have made plugins 
that do the job very nicely. One of the best, I think, is Contact Form 7 by Takayuki Miyoshi. It’s not as 
WYSIWYG as, say, cForms (another popular contact form plugin) but it’s not as complicated either.
You access the plugin from a section of the side admin menu that appears after activation. You can see 
from Figure 36-8 that it’s an extremely simple menu — a single Edit link.
In fact, the entire plugin runs on a single page. If you have more than one form, you’ll see them all 
listed in the menu at the top of the page, where you can also add new forms.

274
Part X: Extending WordPress
Figure 36-8
As I said, this is not a WYSIWYG format, so you see the HTML for the form over on the left. However, gen-
erating form elements, such as text ﬁ elds or radio buttons, is very simple. Just drop down the Generate Tag 
menu on the right, choose the kind of element you want — in this case a plain text ﬁ eld — and you get a 
box like the one in Figure 36-9.
Figure 36-9

275
Lesson 36: Example Plugins
You have lots of options and when you’re done, the brown bar at the bottom displays the code you copy 
and paste into the form HTML on the left. 
The bottom half of the Contact Form 7 screen lets you set the e-mail where the form is sent (by default 
it uses your main WordPress e-mail). You can then format the e-mail that’s sent, as you can see in 
Figure 36-10.
Figure 36-10
Again, you’re going to need to do your own copying and pasting, but it’s still very straightforward. The 
items in the square brackets are simply the names of the ﬁ elds you set up in the top half of the screen. 
Contact Form 7 has created the most common items for you; you just need to ﬁ ll in any other customi-
zations you need. For a newsletter signup form, for example, I might want the e-mail to display certain 
ﬁ elds that I created for that form. I just copy and paste the correct ﬁ eld names into the message body.

276
Part X: Extending WordPress
1. 
Go to Plugins ➪ Add New. You can skip to step 6 if you installed the Contact Form 7 plugin 
during the Try It portion of the previous lesson.
 2. 
Search for Contact Form 7.
3. 
Click Install.
 4. 
In the resulting popup window, click Install Now.
5. 
On the success page, click Activate.
 6. 
On your side admin menu, click the new Contact link.
7. 
You’ll be taken to the Contact Form 7 screen and there’s a default form called Contact Form 1.
 8. 
Scroll down to the Mail area and in the To ﬁ eld you should see the default e-mail address from 
your WordPress installation. If you want the form to mail to that address, don’t do anything, or 
else enter a new e-mail address.
9. 
Go back to the top of the screen and just below the title Contact Form 1 you’ll see a dark brown 
bar with some code in it — copy that code.
 10. 
If you don’t already have a contact page, create one.
11. 
In the Text Editor of the contact page, paste the code you copied.
 12. 
Publish or Update the contact page.
13. 
View the contact page on your site and you should see the form. Fill it out and e-mail yourself a 
message.
 14. 
If you don’t want the form or the plugin, be sure to erase the code from the contact page and 
then deactivate the plugin.

Ten Other Common Uses 
for Plugins
So far in this book, I’ve talked brieﬂ y about plugins that help back up your WordPress site, plugins 
for photo galleries, plugins for contact forms, and plugins for statistics.
This lesson looks at ten additional plugin categories to help you expand your site and brieﬂ y out-
lines a few speciﬁ c plugins for each. I include the speciﬁ c plugin names to make it easier when 
you’re searching on the Plugins ➪ Add New page.
Social Networking
Connecting WordPress to other social media is one of the hottest areas of plugin development 
these days and it’s hard to keep up with new offerings. In Lesson 24 I talked about how easy it is 
to display your latest Tweets on your WordPress site and plugins are available that can help make 
it even easier.
Here, I want to talk about two other functions that plugins can provide with respect to social 
networking: 
Letting visitors easily use social media to let others know about your site
 
❑
Letting you easily repurpose your WordPress content on your social networking accounts
 
❑
Visitors can share what they’ve found on your WordPress site if you install one of several multi-
function plugins. Through a single button visitors can share your content by instant message, 
e-mail, social bookmark, or posting to Facebook or Twitter. Three of the simplest plugins that do 
this are Add to Any, ShareThis, and Add This. Some plugins target speciﬁ c social networking tools. 
Twitter is hot right now and more and more plugins like the TweetMeme Button are becoming avail-
able. What’s nice about this plugin is that it sits at the top of each post encouraging people to Tweet 
about the post, with a bubble showing how many people have already done that. 

278
Part X: Extending WordPress
The other group of social networking plugins aims to make life easier for website owners who want the 
same information they just posted to their site to appear on their social networking account. Plugins 
such as Twitter Tools integrate your posts with your Twitter account, and plugins like Wordbook do the 
same for Facebook. 
Mobile
Looking good on platforms like iPhone is becoming increasingly important, and there’s a growing 
number of WordPress plugins to make a clean mobile view of your site as painless as possible.
WordPress Mobile Edition is a plugin and a theme — the plugin detects if someone is viewing your site 
on a mobile device and switches them to the special theme that is designed for mobile viewing. You can 
update the list of devices detected.
If you need to administer your WordPress site through a mobile device, WPhone can help by giving you 
the choice at login of viewing the admin screens in a special format.
Another group of mobile plugins, such as WordPress Mobile Pack, offers a combination of viewer and 
admin interfaces, plus automated features like cached image scaling, splitting posts into multiple pages, 
and special widgets aimed at mobile users.
Ad Managers
Ad management plugins for WordPress roughly fall into two categories: those that manage ads deliv-
ered through networks and those that manage both network ads and ones from your own advertisers.
If you’re only interested in running ads from a single network, such as Google Adsense, then search for 
plugins using the name of the network. If you wan to run ads from multiple networks, then a plugin 
like Advertising Manager is the way to go. Afﬁ liate marketing also ﬁ ts into this category as well. If you’re 
an afﬁ liate with, say, Amazon, then do a search on the name to ﬁ nd plugins that help you manage your 
offerings. 
If you’re looking to manage both network ads and your own advertisers, plugins are available that 
help you upload the ﬁ les, and then keep track of impressions and clickthroughs, such as Ad-minister or 
Random/Rotating Ads V2. However, free hosted services like OpenX.org also exist. These companies offer 
powerful ad delivery and tracking functions, and OpenX in particular has a great WordPress integra-
tion. All the software and ad delivery is done from its servers so you don’t have to bother with the tech-
nical end of things.
Search Engine Optimization
In Lessons 30 and 31 I touched brieﬂ y on the complex issue of optimizing your website to increase its 
chances of a high ranking in search engine results. There are many plugins that can help you with this 
task, and the granddaddy of them all is All in One SEO Pack (in fact it’s the most downloaded plugin of all). 

279
Lesson 37: Ten Other Common Uses for Plugins
Among the many features is the ability to not only automatically generate meta tags for individual pages, 
but to optimize titles automatically. Of course you can override these any time and do your own tweaking.
Some SEO plugins focus on particular tasks, such as SEO Title Tag, which let’s you create search-engine 
friendly HTML title tags (your page may be titled About, but the title tag needs more detail). If you want to 
have easy control over how search engines index your site, Robots Meta is a very powerful plugin. If you’ve 
just installed WordPress you might consider the SEO Automatic WP_CORE_TWEAKS plugin which helps 
you take care of lots of little things, like switching the default post category from Uncategorized, getting rid 
of the Hello World post, and other little details. 
Podcasting and Videos
If you’re going to be working with more than the occasional video on your site, it’s well worth installing 
a plugin to help display and manage them. One of the most powerful for managing videos is wordTube 
because it creates its own library from which you can create various playlists. It also handles audio ﬁ les 
and lets you upload your videos as well as pasting URLs from third-party video sites like YouTube. 
Another very popular plugin that handles both audio and video is podPress, although at the time of 
writing it hadn't been updated in quite some time. 
If you want a very simple way to manage links to videos on third-party sites, Viper’s Video Quicktags is a 
popular plugin for that. It creates buttons on your Text Editor for a number of popular video sites, such 
as YouTube and Vimeo, while giving you lots of customization options for the display of the videos.
Many video plugins for WordPress rely on the JW Player (www.longtailvideo.com) to display 
video ﬁ les. Although this player is available for free, that’s only for non-commercial use. If your site is 
commercial (check the JW Player terms), you'll need to purchase a license. If you have multiple com-
mercial sites, there are generous discounts for multi-site licenses.
Google Maps
Plenty of plugins are available for putting Google Maps in your posts and pages, but many, such as the 
popular XML Google Maps, require the use of XML or other ﬁ les to control the look of the map, position-
ing of markers, and so on — easy if you’re the programmer type, not so much for the rest of us. MapPress 
Easy Google Maps makes the creation of maps very simple, yet still offers powerful features. In fact, you 
can edit maps right in your posts, drag markers wherever you want, control the look of the markers and 
the popup windows with your HTML editor, add photos to the popups, and much more. 
Most WordPress mapping plugins are for Google Maps, which means you’ll need 
a Google Maps API Key to run any of them. Not a problem, it’s easy to get the key, 
but as of the writing of this book, you can only use that key on a single domain and 
you only get one key. Not so bad if you’re running a single site, but for everyone 
else, you’ll need to choose wisely before using up your precious key.

Part X: Extending WordPress
E-commerce
 There are not a lot of choices for WordPress shopping cart or catalog plugins, but fortunately they’re 
good choices WP e-Commerce is a very nice plugin and though it isn’t free, it’s very reasonable, even if 
you go for the add-on modules (and most people will want to). There’s also a very active community 
of users for this plugin so you can get lots of help there, although the documentation is very good and 
setup is straightforward.
eShop takes a very different approach to integrating with WordPress. Instead of adding database tables 
to store catalog data, this plugin utilizes posts and pages for entering product information. It integrates 
with PayPal and a few other gateways, and it can handle downloadable products.
Of course, so many excellent open source shopping programs are available that it can be difﬁ cult to jus-
tify all the work needed to create WordPress plugins that will match their power and sophistication. On 
the other hand, with WordPress becoming more and more of a general content management system, the 
demand for having a single administration interface and not having to maintain two separate programs 
may lead to more e-commerce plugins.
Random Content
Displaying random content in the sidebar has long been a mainstay of blogging, so lots of WordPress 
plugins are available to help you randomize content such as posts, comments, and so on: Random Posts 
or Random Posts Widget or Most Popular Posts.
Plugins are also available that allow you to add content to your site that’s outside of the WordPress 
post/page structure and randomly display it. Typically these are thought of as random quote genera-
tors, but the more sophisticated versions, such as Stray Random Quotes, can be used as mini content 
management systems, because they allow you to categorize content and then have detailed control of 
its display. So, for example, on the Island Travel site, I could have interesting facts about Aruba as a cat-
egory, and then display only those facts, at random, on the pages about Aruba.
Comment Enhancement
For blogs in particular, comments are an important part of the interactivity and sense of community that 
you’re trying to create. One of the ways to keep your visitors connected to your site is to use a plugin 
like Subscribe to Comments. This popular plugin allows commenters to receive email notiﬁ cation when a 
new comment is made about the post. They can unsubscribe from individual posts, update their email 
address and much more. To make the editing and management of comments easier, a plugin like WP 
Ajax Edit Comments is very helpful. It even allows comments not placed into moderation to be edited by 
the commenter for a limited time.
Some plugins will display a list of the most recent comments, for example the very popular Get Recent 
Comments, while others, like Most Commented, list the top posts based on how many comments they have.

281
Lesson 37: Ten Other Common Uses for Plugins
Housekeeping
There are lots of housekeeping issues that can be addressed by plugins. Here are a few of the most 
important:
Spam
By default, WordPress comes with an anti-spam plugin called Akismet for which you’ll need an API 
Key from WordPress.com, as I explained in Lesson 32. It’s by far the most popular way of reducing the 
amount of comment spam, but many other plugins are available as well, such as Bad Behaviour, which 
takes the approach of stopping the spammers before they can leave a comment, by looking at their 
delivery system and other factors as they try to access your site. WP-SpamFree Anti-Spam also operates 
without an API Key or any sort of CAPTCHA challenges (those deliberately hard to read letters you see 
all the time). If you do want a visual CAPTCHA system there are lots of plugins to do that, but you’re 
best off with one like SI CAPTCHA for WordPress, which includes audio for those who can’t easily see 
the images. Other plugins, like CryptX, can be used to hide e-mail addresses in your posts so they can’t 
be harvested by spammers.
Revisions
I mentioned earlier in the book about potential issues with WordPress’s revision system — having data-
bases bloated with records for every single revision. Searching on the word “revisions” will produce a 
long list of plugins to help you deal with this the way you want. Some, like Revision Control, allow you 
to keep revisions but deal with them globally or on a per-post basis, as well as delete speciﬁ c revisions. 
Others, like No Revisions, simply make it easy to turn off revisions completely (instead of having to mess 
with the code in your conﬁ g ﬁ le).
Security
In addition to having tough passwords, proper ﬁ le permissions, and updating WordPress and plugins, 
lots of other little things can add to security. Plugins like WP Security Scan or Secure WordPress will auto-
matically perform tasks such as: keep tabs on ﬁ le permissions, database security, hide your WordPress 
version information, or even place index.html ﬁ les into folders that don’t have one.
Try It
My best recommendation for trying something in this lesson is to search the WordPress.org plugins 
directory and get a feel for the variety of functions they can perform.
To see a walkthrough of the plugin directory, watch the video for Lesson 37 on 
the enclosed DVD. 


Extending WordPress 
Even Further
The goal of this book was to get you up and running with WordPress and show you how to use the 
software to build websites. I also introduced you to the possibilities of extending the functionality 
of WordPress through plugins. Now I want to say a little about the customization of theme tem-
plates, which is the next stage for making WordPress serve your needs.
Taking apart the coding of theme templates, reworking them, or creating new templates is not 
for the faint of heart, and the topic is certainly beyond the scope of this book. My aim is to give 
you some ideas about what customization can do for you, which, in turn, gives you a good start-
ing point either for learning more yourself or for talking about customization with someone who 
knows how to work with WordPress themes. 
One of the strengths of WordPress is that it’s built from the ground up to be customized, and cen-
tral to this design is the concept of theme templates. They contain the instructions for WordPress 
to retrieve information from the database — your posts, pages, and media ﬁ les — and present it 
in the form of HTML pages. The most basic way that theme templates enable customization is the 
ability to change the look of your WordPress site in an instant by changing themes, but that’s only 
the tip of the iceberg.
Template Hierarchy
Did you know that WordPress really only needs a single PHP ﬁ le in a theme? No theme builder 
would choose that option because it would be both limiting and complicated to code, but because 
of a concept called template hierarchy, WordPress could, if need be, function with just an index.php 
ﬁ le (along with a stylesheet). 

284
Part X: Extending WordPress
When WordPress goes looking for instructions on how to assemble a particular HTML page, it has sev-
eral lists of template ﬁ les to look for. If it doesn’t ﬁ nd one, it looks for the next one on the list, and so on. 
In the end, if none of the ﬁ les are on the list, it looks for index.php. If it doesn’t ﬁ nd that, then you’re in 
trouble.
The beauty of this design is that in order to take advantage of the hierarchy, you just need to drop a prop-
erly named template ﬁ le into your theme folder and WordPress will automatically start using it instead 
of the next ﬁ le down the list. For example, if I want all posts in category 6 to display a certain amount of 
information with a certain look, I just create a template ﬁ le called category-6.php and WordPress will 
follow the instructions in that ﬁ le whenever it’s displaying category 6.
When creating a new page, if you select something other than the default page template, you’re mak-
ing use of the template hierarchy. If you choose the Link template, what you’re telling WordPress is 
to put links.php at the top of its list of template ﬁ les to look for when displaying that page. Suppose 
links.php accidentally got erased — no problem, WordPress would simply look for page.php. If that 
didn’t exist, WordPress would look for index.php. Aside from being a tool for customization, the tem-
plate hierarchy is also a kind of fail-safe system that keeps your site displaying in one form or another.
Remember that any amount of customization you do to a theme’s templates means that 
you can’t simply switch themes without replicating the customizations in the new theme. 
If you make a lot of customizations, your best strategy for switching to a new theme is to 
duplicate your customized theme to a newly named folder and then make changes to the 
ﬁ les that control the look of the site. You’ll also have to make some changes in the style 
.css ﬁ le so that WordPress understands it’s a different theme — you can ﬁ nd all the 
details of creating a new theme at http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development.
The Power of Custom Fields
Now what you do inside template ﬁ les is up to you and one of the most powerful tools for customizing 
template ﬁ les is through the use of custom ﬁ elds. As you may recall from earlier lessons, these are special 
ﬁ elds in the WordPress database that you can create yourself by giving them a name (which can be then 
shared by all other posts or pages) and assigning a value for the particular post.
On the Island Travel site, for example, I could create a set of custom ﬁ elds for use on destination pages: 
capital city, population, average hours of sunshine. Then I would code the template used by those pages 
to look for values in the three ﬁ elds. If a value is found, the template would print out the information in 
whatever format I chose, for example, in a box just below the page title.
Custom ﬁ elds are also great for setting up conditional situations that can actually produce a different 
layout of information. Suppose on all travel package posts for Island Travel I have a custom ﬁ eld called 
special-offer. I can code the template so that if the ﬁ eld says Yes, display the information in a certain 
order with a certain look, but if not, display it the regular way. 

285
Lesson 38: Extending WordPress Even Further
Keeping Things User-Friendly and Flexible
Whatever customizations you have done to your theme — by yourself or someone else — always remem-
ber to make them user-friendly. That reduces the need for calling someone in again at a later date. That 
really means thinking ahead when making modiﬁ cations and asking if they could be used in other con-
texts, though maybe not right away.
As a result, you might want to make certain elements into variables that are easily controlled by WordPress 
users, such as through custom ﬁ elds or even with a custom screen in the admin section. The key is to keep 
everything as ﬂ exible as possible. 
For instance, if you create a new page template that’s hard-coded in some respect to a particular category, 
why not make that category a variable that can be changed by the user in the custom ﬁ elds area. Then 
the template could be used for a variety of purposes. Or instead of changing the coding in page.php to 
create a conditional situation, why not create a separate page template that could be used in a variety of 
situations. Even if you never used it again, the possibility is there and you also didn’t need to ﬁ ddle with 
the base page.php ﬁ le.
Some Final Thoughts
I hope this book has been and will continue to be a valuable resource for you and your WordPress site. 
My aim has been not simply to show you how to do things, but to explain some of the why’s and help 
you to think about new ways to make your WordPress site work for you. 
My clients always get very excited about their websites after I’ve built them in or converted them over 
to WordPress. They tell me they feel empowered and, as a result, they’re more interested in maintaining 
and expanding their sites, which is exactly what a content management system ought to do.
So have fun with your new website and don’t forget about the tremendous community of WordPress 
users out there. You’ll never want for inspiration or help, and hopefully you can do the same for others 
as your experience grows.


Troubleshooting WordPress
I’ve tried throughout the book to include small troubleshooting tips with the lesson to which they 
relate. In this lesson the goal is help you think through the troubleshooting process.
Consider the variables involved in viewing a web page: what computer you’re using, what web 
browser and what version, what Internet service provider you’re using, what type of server the 
website is on, what version of WordPress you’re running, what versions are being run for the 
dozens of software packages required to run a web server, and so on. No wonder then, that you 
might have a problem and virtually no one else has exactly the same one.
Addressing particular problems is next to impossible in a few pages, but what I can do is offer 
some strategies for trying to solve problems, as well as provide some ideas for getting more infor-
mation online.
Troubleshooting an Installation
Although WordPress installations are straightforward, sometimes there are issues. Here are some 
suggestions for a few of the most common.
 1. 
Error connecting to the database: Check that you correctly entered the database name, 
username, and password, and that you don’t have any stray spaces before or after each 
variable (that can happen in particular when you’re copying and pasting). Re-enter the 
information and try again.
 2. 
“Headers already sent” error messages: This is usually caused by the presence of charac-
ters or whitespace before a ﬁ le’s opening <?php tag or after the closing ?> tag. You can tell 
which ﬁ le is causing the problem by looking for the part of the error message that begins 
(output started at /path/ and the php ﬁ le at the end of that path is the culprit. 

288
Appendix A: Troubleshooting WordPress
It will also tell you the line number where the problem is occurring. Using a text editor — not 
Word or any word processor — check that there’s nothing before the opening <?php tag or after 
the closing ?> tag. Delete any characters or spaces, save the ﬁ le, and upload again.
 3. 
500 Internal Server Error: If you have access to your server logs (through hosting control pan-
els like cPanel or Parallels for example) you should check there for speciﬁ c information on the 
cause of the error. It may be a problem with an .htaccess ﬁ le or from ﬁ les not having the right 
permissions, but you really need the log report to point you in the right direction. If you don’t 
have access to the log ﬁ les you’ll need to contact your hosting company.
Troubleshooting After Installation
Once WordPress is up and running, potential problems can be divided into three general categories:
The entire site is down
 
❑
A particular function (usually a plugin) stops working
 
❑
Speciﬁ c content is not appearing
 
❑
Each category would lead you to look in a very different place for answers. If the site is down completely, 
there will often be an error message to guide you: no database connection, internal server error, and so 
on. If a plugin is not working, the answer is likely to do with the set of plugins you have activated (I give 
some hints about troubleshooting plugins in Lesson 35).
Whatever category of problem you’re having, it’s usually helpful to remember or ﬁ nd out if anything 
has changed recently: 
You added a new plugin
 
❑
You made some change in the admin settings
 
❑
You just upgraded WordPress or there was an upgrade and you haven’t done it yet
 
❑
There was some problem or change with your hosting provider (it may have upgraded its ver-
 
❑
sion of PHP, for example) 
Armed with this kind of information, you can narrow down the problem and get closer to an answer. 
One way to tell if there’s been some web-wide problem is to check the WordPress 
forums and see if others have suddenly started reporting a similar issue.
If speciﬁ c content is not appearing on your site, check that you properly saved the material or that you 
haven’t deleted a category (in which case all posts from the category will have been moved automati-
cally to the default category). It could be that you accidentally unpublished the item. Remember, unless 
you physically delete something from WordPress, it will still be in the system, even if it doesn’t show on 
the live site.

Finding Help Online
Because problems with WordPress are often very speciﬁ c to your particular circumstances, searching 
online for someone who’s had the same problem is going to be your best bet. Fortunately, there’s a huge 
community of WordPress users who share their experiences in a variety of ways, and here are some 
suggestions for ﬁ nding them. 
The WordPress.org Site
The number one place to start is the Forum section of the WordPress.org website. You’ll ﬁ nd a wealth of 
information about real-world applications of WordPress and helpful solutions, as well as ideas on mak-
ing WordPress do exactly what you need it to do. I know I’ve found a lot of inspiration there for cus-
tomizations I’d never thought of. Although you don’t need to register to use the forum, it’s well worth it 
so that you can post problems for which you haven’t found a solution.
When you think you haven’t found an answer to your problem, your ﬁ rst action 
should be: search again. If you still haven’t found the answer, search again! Of 
course I mean use different wording for each search, follow suggested threads in 
the results you do ﬁ nd, and try to approach the search from different angles. Be 
a detective. You’ll save yourself (and other people in the forum) a lot of time and 
trouble, and you won’t clog the forum with repeat questions.
I would almost guarantee that your problem has at least been voiced by someone, 
even if it hasn’t been resolved, and you’re better off joining that thread than start-
ing a new one.
On the WordPress.org site you’ll also ﬁ nd a very helpful set of frequently asked questions: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ as well as whole page of tips on how to ﬁ nd help: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_WordPress_Help.
Using Search Engines
When it comes to searching for help online the best tip is to be as speciﬁ c as you can in your search terms. 
Simply typing website is broken or page crashes is far too general, but even if you type menu not showing prop-
erly that’s still less speciﬁ c than the sidebar menu is not showing all my categories. Once you’re more speciﬁ c, 
be sure to try other wording as well, such as displaying instead of showing — not everyone uses the same 
terminology.
Another aspect of being speciﬁ c is to remember to narrow the search to your speciﬁ c software. If the 
issue is with WordPress, be sure to include +wordpress (you may have to use Advanced Search to force a 
term to be in the search) along with whatever other terms you’re searching for. Or if it’s a problem with 
PHP, use +php to make sure you’re focused on the right scripting language. 
It’s also important to put quotes around phrases: sidebar widget is a very different search from “sidebar 
widget” because the ﬁ rst will look for each word separately, whereas the second tells the search engine 
to ﬁ nd them together as a phrase.

290
Appendix A: Troubleshooting WordPress
If you’re getting an error message, enclose the entire message (or if it’s very long, choose what looks like 
the most relevant part) in quotation marks and do your search on that. Including your operating system 
in the search, along with your browser, can also get you to your answer faster.
Finding Professional Help
If you can’t ﬁ nd an answer online or the answer is difﬁ cult to implement, it may be time to hire some-
one to troubleshoot for you. You can search for phrases like wordpress expert. You can also post your 
needs on sites like WordPress Jobs (http://jobs.wordpress.net) or on the WP-Pro mailing list 
(http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-pro).

Glossary
Activate a plugin  The next step after installing a plugin. WordPress displays a list of plugins you’ve 
installed, but you need to activate them before they function on your site. You can de-activate a plugin 
but that still leaves it installed.
Administrator  The highest level of WordPress users. Administrators have full access to all 
administrative functions, as opposed to, say, Editors, who cannot change the theme of a site or do 
anything with plugins.
Attachment  Any ﬁ le that has been uploaded to a post or page and as a result is listed in the gal-
lery for that post or page. Though the ﬁ le can be used anywhere on the site, that uploading process 
created a unique relationship to the post or page and in that sense the ﬁ le has been attached to it.
Avatar  A small graphic or image used in WordPress comments to represent the person making 
the comment.
Backup  Saving and storing a copy of any information. Backing up WordPress is a two-step pro-
cess: backing up the database, and backing up the theme and uploaded ﬁ les.
Blogroll  A list of links. The name comes from that fact that it was originally intended to display 
favorite blogs or other sites you regularly visit.
Bookmarklet  A button on a browser’s bookmark bar that allows the user to perform a function 
quickly and easily. WordPress has a Press It bookmarklet that allows users to instantly blog about 
something they’re viewing in their browser.
Capability  A task that a user is able to perform in the WordPress administrative area. Different 
users have varying degrees of capabilities, with administrators having all capabilities.
Category  Categories are used to group related content. WordPress has two types of categories: 
post categories and link categories. Pages cannot be categorized.
Class  An attribute in HTML that allows a CSS style to be applied to any part of a web page that 
has that class. Example: <p class=”importantparagraph”>.

292
Appendix B: Glossary
CMS  Content Management System. A CMS is software that allows users to easily store, organize, and 
update information, usually for display on the Web.
Comments  Responses to your content that are submitted using a form and, if approved, are displayed 
for other visitors to read. You can choose whether to allow the comment form to appear on all, some, or 
none of your WordPress content.
cPanel  A popular online tool that allows people to easily manage their web-hosting accounts (adding 
e-mail accounts, setting up databases, and so on).
CSS  Cascading Style Sheets. A style sheet language used to control the look, formatting, and layout of 
a web page written in HTML. The cascading part refers to the ways in which style rules get applied.
Dashboard  The homepage of the WordPress administrative interface. 
Database  Software that stores data in various types and enables relationships to be established 
between the data. WordPress uses a MySQL database.
Deprecated  Functions or template tags in WordPress that are no longer supported and eventually will 
be obsolete.
Draft  A post or page that has been saved but not yet published; also the state of a previously pub-
lished page that has been unpublished.
Excerpt  A short summary of a post that is entered separately in the excerpt ﬁ eld or is auto-generated 
using the ﬁ rst 55 words of the post.
Feed  A data format used to provide users with frequently updated content. WordPress creates many 
different feeds of your site’s content in a variety of feed types, such as RSS.
FTP  File Transfer Protocol. An FTP program is used to transfer ﬁ les back and forth to your server. 
Gallery  A list of all ﬁ les associated with a particular post or page. Also, a display within the body of a 
post or page showing thumbnails of all image ﬁ les belonging to a post or page.
Hosting Provider  Anyone who runs a server connected to the Internet and provides accounts for peo-
ple to run their websites and/or e-mail.
HTML  Hypertext Markup Language. This is the basic language used to generate pages on the Internet. 
For example:
<p><em>Emphasized text</em> has certain tags around it, while all the text in this 
paragraph is surrounded by the opening and closing paragraph tags</p>
ID  An attribute in HTML that allows a CSS style to be applied to a unique area on a web page. In other 
words, an id name can only be used once per page. Example: <p id=”best paragraph”>.
Install a plugin  In order to use plugins—add-on software that extends the functions of WordPress—
you must ﬁ rst install them, which means that the ﬁ le or ﬁ les for the plugin have been uploaded to a 
special plugins folder on the server, using either a ﬁ le transfer program (FTP) or the automated install 
process in WordPress.

293
Appendix B: Glossary
JavaScript  One of the most popular client-side scripting languages for use on web pages. Client-side 
means that it runs in the visitor’s browser, which allows JavaScript to react to clicks, mouse movements, 
and so on, producing effects such as menus changing color when you place your mouse over them. Not 
to be confused with the programming language Java.
The Loop  A section of WordPress template ﬁ les that automatically runs through all possible pieces of 
content that meet a certain criteria and displays them according to the coding for that loop. For example, 
WordPress might loop through all posts in Category 6 and display the date, title, and body of each.
Meta  Typically used when talking about meta tags, which provide information about a web page, par-
ticularly to search engines, such as a description or a list of keywords relating to the page. In WordPress, 
the term is also used in relation to posts—post metadata—for such information as the date, categories, 
tags, and other details about the post.
MySQL  One of the most popular open-source databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
MySQL is the database used by WordPress.
Page  A WordPress page is often said to be for “static” content. This is meant to be a contrast with 
posts, which typically are organized by date and time. The history of a company would be material for a 
page, while a press release would be material for a post. WordPress pages can be organized into hierar-
chies of parent and child pages, but unlike posts cannot be categorized or tagged.
Permalink  This is short for “permanent link.” The idea of a permanent link is to provide a way for oth-
ers on the Internet to always ﬁ nd a page on your website, even if you change something that could affect 
that link, such as a post title.
Permissions  Attributes of a ﬁ le or directory (folder) on a web server that determine what action a par-
ticular user may take with respect to that ﬁ le or directory (reading, writing, or executing the content).
PHP  This scripting language is one of the most widely used for generating dynamic content on web 
pages. PHP is a server-side language, which means that it works before reaching the user’s browser, as 
opposed to a language like JavaScript, which functions in the browser. WordPress is written using PHP. 
Virtually all hosting providers offer PHP, whether on a Windows, Unix/Linux, or Mac platform.
phpMyAdmin  A popular open-source interface for managing MySQL databases.
Pingback  One type of notiﬁ cation you receive in WordPress to tell you that someone has linked to content 
on your site. For this to happen, your site must be pingback-enabled, which is set in the admin section.
Plesk/Parallels  A popular online tool that makes it easy for people to manage their web hosting 
accounts (creating e-mail accounts, setting up databases, and so on).
Plugin  A ﬁ le or set of ﬁ les that provide additional functionality for WordPress, such as suggesting 
related content to visitors or displaying maps. Plugins must ﬁ rst be installed in WordPress and in order 
to work, must be activated.
Post  A type of content in WordPress that can be categorized. The order of displaying posts in a cat-
egory can be controlled according to several parameters such as date published, title, and so on.
Post Status  Tells you whether a post or page is published, unpublished, in draft mode, or pending review. 
Publish  Publishing a post or a page tells WordPress to display it on your site. You can always save 
them as drafts until you’re ready to publish. You can also tell WordPress to automatically publish posts 
or pages in the future.

294
Appendix B: Glossary
RSS  Really Simple Syndication. This is a type of feed format (see Feed).
Scheduling  By default, publishing a post or page in WordPress — making it live on your site — happens 
immediately, but you can also schedule them to publish at a future date and time.
Sidebar  The area of a website on the left or ride side of the page, where items such as navigation, 
advertising, and small chunks of content are displayed.
Slug  A word or series of words in lower-case lettering and containing no spaces. There are slugs for posts, 
pages, categories, tags, and authors, and they’re used by WordPress to make URLs more descriptive.
Style Sheet  A ﬁ le that contains the CSS used to create the look, formatting, and layout of a web page.
Tag  A keyword you assign to posts and which can be shared by other posts. Posts can have multiple 
tags. Tags are much like categories, but are not meant to be as broad in scope as categories.
Teaser  The portion of a post prior to the point where you’ve added a More tag to the post.
Template  A ﬁ le in WordPress themes that provides instructions for assembling HTML pages. 
Templates may use other templates in the assembly process.
Text Editor  In WordPress this refers to the ﬁ eld on post or page editing screens where the content is 
edited. Also refers to a program on your computer that you should always use when editing WordPress 
theme ﬁ les. Text editors (sometimes called plain text editors) do not introduce the extra information that 
word processors use, and which can cause problems for ﬁ les on the Internet.
Theme  The set of ﬁ les that controls the layout, look, and certain aspects of the content on the HTML 
pages generated by WordPress. A theme consists of at least one style sheet and at least one template ﬁ le.
Trackback  One type of notiﬁ cation you receive in WordPress to tell you that someone has linked to 
content on your site.
Update  To replace the current version of WordPress, a plugin, or a theme, with a newer one. 
Update (button)  When you see this word on a button, it means you must click it in order to save any 
changes you’ve made. It’s very important to get in the habit of clicking this before you leave a screen, 
even if you don’t remember changing anything.
URL or URI  Uniform Resource Locator or Uniform Resource Identiﬁ er. Although a URL is a subtype 
of URIs, the two are commonly treated as the same. A URI is any string of characters that identiﬁ es a 
resource on the Internet, but is most commonly used to refer to the address of a website or web page, 
such as www.wordpress.org.
User  Someone who is a registered user on a WordPress site. There are ﬁ ve levels of users with varying 
degrees of capabilities: Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber.
Widget  A piece of code that allows you to place chunks of content (for example, a list of categories, 
recent posts) on your website (typically in the sidebar) using a drag-and-drop interface. 
WYSIWYG  Stands for What You See Is What You Get. In the WordPress Text Editor, there is a Visual 
mode, which displays posts in a partly WYSIWYG format (to see them exactly as they will appear on the 
web, you need to use Preview), as opposed to HTML mode, which displays the post with all the code 
used by the browser to display it.

What’s on the DVD?
You’ve read about how WordPress can make creating and maintaining a website much easier — 
time to see it in action. I love working with my clients online or in person to help train them in 
the use of WordPress, and that’s how I’ve approached this DVD: to be your virtual coach. So let’s 
get started.
This appendix provides you with information on the contents of the DVD that accompanies this 
book. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the ReadMe ﬁ le located at the root of 
the DVD. Here is what you will ﬁ nd in this appendix:
System Requirements
 
❑
Using the DVD
 
❑
What’s on the DVD
 
❑
Troubleshooting
 
❑
System Requirements
Make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements listed in this section. If 
your computer doesn’t match up to most of these requirements, you may have a problem using 
the contents of the DVD. 
PC running Windows XP or later, or Mac running OSX
 
❑
A DVD-ROM drive
 
❑
Adobe Flash Player 9 or later (free download from Adobe.com)
 
❑

296
Appendix C: What’s on the DVD?
Helpful, but not absolutely necessary:
Internet connection
 
❑
Installed version of WordPress (or a blog with WordPress.com)
 
❑
Using the DVD on a PC
To access the content from the DVD, follow these steps.
 1. 
Insert the DVD into your computer’s DVD-ROM drive. The license agreement appears
The interface won’t launch if you have autorun disabled. In that case, click Start ➪ Run (For Windows 
Vista, Start ➪ All Programs ➪ Accessories ➪ Run). In the dialog box that appears, type D:\Start.exe. 
(Replace D with the proper letter if your DVD drive uses a different letter. If you don’t know the letter, 
see how your CD drive is listed under My Computer.) Click OK.
 2. 
Read through the license agreement, and then click the Accept button if you want to use the DVD.
The DVD interface appears. Simply select the lesson video you want to view.
Using the DVD on a Mac
To install the items from the DVD to your hard drive, follow these steps:
 1. 
Insert the DVD into your computer’s DVD-ROM drive.
 2. 
The DVD icon will appear on your desktop; double-click to open.
 3. 
Double-click the Start button.
 4. 
Read the license agreement and click the Accept button to use the DVD.
 5. 
The DVD interface will appear. Here you can install the programs and run the demos.
What’s on the DVD
Nothing beats watching how something is done and that’s why I’ve provided several hours worth of video 
about how you can use WordPress. Most lessons in the book have an accompanying video, which not only 
illustrates several of the examples in the lesson, but goes well beyond what can be covered in print. You’ll 
also gain more insight into the creation of the sample website discussed in the book: Island Travel.
If you have an existing WordPress site — a self-hosted version or a blog on WordPress.com — I encourage 
you to work along in the admin screen. If you don’t have a site, you could install WordPress if you have a 
web hosting account (see Lesson 3) or you could open an account with WordPress.com. The main thing is 
that you be able to practice what’s covered in the book and on these videos.

Appendix C: What’s on the DVD?
Troubleshooting
If you have difﬁ culty installing or using any of the materials on the companion DVD, try the following 
solutions:
Turn off any anti-virus software that you may have running:
 
❑
 Installers sometimes mimic virus 
activity and can make your computer incorrectly believe that it is being infected by a virus. (Be 
sure to turn the anti-virus software back on later.)
Close all running programs:
 
❑
 The more programs you’re running, the less memory is available 
to other programs. Installers also typically update ﬁ les and programs; if you keep other pro-
grams running, installation may not work properly.
Reference the ReadMe: 
 
❑
Please refer to the ReadMe ﬁ le located at the root of the DVD-ROM for 
the latest product information at the time of publication.
Reboot if necessary:
 
❑
 If all else fails, rebooting your machine can often clear any conﬂ icts in the 
system.
