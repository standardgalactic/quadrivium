Preventing Identity Theft For Dummies

Introduction
I
n this book, I tell you how to prevent identity theft and
what to do if you are a victim. If you’re wondering what
sort of information is vulnerable and should be shredded, or
how to reclaim your credit if you have been a victim, this is
the one-stop reference for you. Today, the name of the game 
is making yourself a hard target, and armed with this book,
you’ll do exactly that.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts to make finding the infor-
mation you need quick and easy.
 Part I, “Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft,” defines iden-
tity theft, who it affects, how it happens, what informa-
tion is vulnerable, and how to protect that information
from being stolen.
 Part II, “Determining Whether You’re a Victim,” gives you
signs to look for to determine whether you are a victim.
You see how you can use your bank statements as an
identity theft prevention tool. You also see how to order
and read your credit report.
 Part III, “Staying Ahead of Identity Theft,” looks at some
good identity theft prevention techniques. Watching what
you throw away and being careful what you say in public
places and online are good identity theft prevention 
techniques.
 Part IV, “Taking Back Your Good Name,” provides infor-
mation on what to do if you are a victim of identity theft.
You also find information in this part about placing a fraud
alert on your credit report, obtaining a police report, and
completing an identity theft affidavit. Finally, this part tells
you when and how to close compromised accounts and
open new ones.

Preventing Identity Theft For Dummies 
2
 Part V, “The Part of Tens,” lists ten tips for helping you
reclaim your identity and good name more smoothly and
offers a list of resources you can use to help prevent
identity theft and, if necessary, reclaim your good name
and credit.
Icons Used in This Book
When you see the tip icon, pay attention — you’ll find an extra
valuable tidbit that may save you from becoming a victim of
identity theft.
Heads up when you see this icon — here’s where I tell you
mistakes you can make that will almost guarantee that you
will become a victim of identity theft, and what to do to avoid
making those mistakes.
This icon indicates a gentle reminder about an important point.
Where to Go from Here
From here, most folks like to browse the table of contents and
find something about identity theft you want to know more
about. The great thing is that you don’t have to read the book
in order, chapter by chapter. You can skip around and go right
to the sections of the book that are of interest to you.
If you haven’t been the victim of identity theft, you may want
to focus on the sections that address preventing identity 
theft. On the other hand, if you have been the victim of iden-
tity theft, you may want to focus on the sections that address
how to reclaim your good name and credit. Toward the end of
the book, I list some resources where you can find additional
information and help.

Part I
Getting the Scoop 
on Identity Theft

In this part . . .
I
dentity theft has become the fastest growing crime in
recent years. In order to ﬁght this crime, you need to
know what it is and whom it affects. You need to know what
information is vulnerable and how to exercise prevention
so that you don’t become a victim.

Chapter 1
Who’s Stealing What...and
What You Can Do About It
In This Chapter
 Understanding the scope of the identity theft problem
 Knowing what information you need to guard
 Using technology to help protect your information
 Finding help against identity theft
 Fighting back if your identity is stolen
I
n this chapter, I explain who identity theft affects, how 
it happens, and what personal information it involves.
Although the fact of identity theft is pretty unnerving, a greater
understanding of identity theft can be empowering. After you
find out what identity theft is all about and how it occurs, you
can protect your personal information from falling into the
wrong hands — and you’ll know the best way to take action if
it does.
Taking a Look at the Fastest
Growing Crime
Identity theft happens when someone (the identity thief) uses
another person’s personal information (such as name, Social
Security number, and date of birth) to fraudulently obtain
credit cards or loans, open a checking account, or otherwise
gain access to money or goods in the other person’s name.

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
6
Identity theft takes two primary forms: financial and criminal.
Financial identity theft includes activities such as credit card
fraud, tax and mail fraud, passing bad checks, and so on. Of
course, the identity thief’s objective is to not pay back any 
of the borrowed money but, instead, to enjoy spending it.
Criminal identity theft expands on the crime by using finan-
cial identity theft to support criminal activities up to and
including terrorism.
In 1998, the U.S. Congress recognized the growth of iden-
tity theft and passed the Identity Theft and Assumption
Deterrence Act, making identity theft a crime. In September
2003, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released the
results of an impact survey that outlined the scope of the
crime. The survey statistics show the following:
 27.3 million Americans have been the victims of identity
theft in the last five years.
 The total cost of this crime to financial institutions in the
United States is $33 billion, and the direct cost to con-
sumers is $5 billion.
 Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the U.S. today.
The crime of identity theft was noted by the FTC as the
fastest growing crime in a survey conducted by the agency
and published in a report on September 3, 2003.
 In 2003, the incidence of identity theft was up to 42 per-
cent of all the complaints that consumers filed to the FTC.
 According to CBSnews.com, “Every 79 seconds, a thief
steals someone’s identity, opens accounts in the victim’s
name, and goes on a buying spree.”
Some other interesting stats from the FTC study that people
find surprising are:
 In more than 25 percent of all cases, the victim knows the
thief.
 In 35 percent of those cases, the thief is a family member
or relative.
 Almost 50 percent of victims don’t know how their infor-
mation was stolen.
 The average out-of-pocket expense to individuals is $500.

So who exactly are the people who fall victim to identity
thieves? Read the next sections to find out the who and how of
identity theft.
Who it affects
In addition to the statistics noted earlier, the FTC survey find-
ings show that identity theft can happen to anyone who has
credit, bank accounts, a Social Security number (SSN), a date of
birth (DOB), or other personal identification information. That
is, almost every man, woman, or child is a potential target. Yes,
even children are susceptible to identity theft because most
children (over 16) have a SSN, and all children have a DOB.
Identity thieves don’t care about age; they just want personal
information they can use to obtain credit.
The sad part is that you can be a victim and not know right
away. For example, you may find out you’re a victim only when
you go to buy a car and get turned down for credit because
your credit report already shows three cars — and you’re not
driving any of them. If you catch it early, however, you can
minimize the amount of time and money necessary to clear
your name.
Anyone, even a celebrity, can become a victim of identity theft.
Tiger Woods, Robert De Niro, and Oprah Winfrey have all been
victims of identity theft. No one is immune, and straightening
out the resulting mess can take years. But you can protect your-
self by practicing identity theft prevention (see my crash course
in Chapter 3 and find more details in Part III) and looking for the
telltale signs in your financial information (see Part II).
How it happens
Unfortunately, it can be fairly simple for identity thieves to
obtain other people’s personal information and ply their
trade. For example, suppose that you lose (or someone steals)
your wallet. In your wallet are your driver’s license (with your
name, address, and DOB), multiple credit cards (gas cards,
department store cards, and at least one major credit card),
ATM cards (if you’re forgetful, with associated PIN numbers
written down), and medical benefits cards (with your Social
Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do
7

Security number as the identifier). Some people even carry
personal checkbooks and their actual Social Security cards in
their wallets. Get the picture? All the information an identity
thief needs is right there in one place.
Identity thieves can also obtain your personal information
through a midnight garbage safari activity known as dumpster
diving. Yes, these thieves will literally go through the garbage
cans in front of your house and scrounge information such as
cancelled checks, bank statements, utility bill statements,
credit card receipts, and those preapproved credit card offers
you’ve been discarding. I discuss what thieves may be looking
for in your garbage and what you can do to thwart them in
“Knowing What Information Is Vulnerable” later in this chap-
ter. You can also find more details in Chapter 2.
Remember this advice: “If you don’t shred, it isn’t dead.” The
non-shredded personal information you’ve tossed in the trash
becomes fair game, and the identity thief thanks you for being
so thoughtful.
Although identity thieves have many ways — some rather
high-tech and sophisticated — to obtain your personal infor-
mation, wallets and garbage are the most common targets.
The point is that after the thief has your personal information,
he or she can assume your identity (at least financially) and
start making purchases, getting cash or loans, and otherwise
using your good credit.
Knowing What Information 
Is Vulnerable
We live in a numbers society: phone numbers, personal identi-
fication numbers (PIN), driver’s license numbers, credit card
numbers, date of birth (DOB), Social Security numbers, bank
account and 401K numbers . . . you get the idea. As the lyrics
of the song “Secret Agent Man” tell us, “They have given you a
number and taken away your name.” Also, employee and med-
ical record numbers and other tidbits of information are used
to identify us as persons today, and that fact gives meaning to
the term personal identification information, because all these
numbers are like keys to your identity on the phone, online,
or in writing.
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
8

The vulnerable personal information that identity thieves use
is as follows:
 Social Security number (SSN): This is, of course, the
nine-digit personal identification number (compliments
of the federal government) that everyone needs to get a
job, pay taxes, and apply for credit. The SSN is like the
key to the kingdom — your financial kingdom, that is. The
identity thief uses your SSN to apply for credit, file false
tax returns, get a job, open bank accounts, and so on.
 Date of birth (DOB): A DOB is a piece of the personal
information puzzle, but if an identity thief has this piece
by itself, it’s not a problem. When the thief uses your DOB
in conjunction with your SSN, he or she can become you.
 Mother’s maiden name: This name is used to verify your
identity when accessing financial information. Identity
thieves use your mother’s maiden name to verify their
identity as being yours in order to access your financial
records and open new accounts in your name.
 Personal identification numbers (PINs): Usually a five or
more digit number used to access your bank accounts
when using your ATM card. 
 Passwords: Your passwords are the keys to any informa-
tion stored electronically. When the identity thief has your
password, he or she has access to the information you are
trying to protect and uses the passwords to access the
information, such as bank accounts, online bill paying
services, and so on. 
 Driver’s license number: The number used to identify
you is printed on your license. When the identity thief
has your driver’s license number, he or she can have a
phony license made that shows your name and driver’s
license number with the thief’s picture.
By using your personal information, identity thieves can party
hardy on your nickel and good credit reputation. They spend
like there’s no tomorrow because they know that someone
else (you) is picking up the tab. Identity thieves can use your
personal information to open accounts, such as a cellular
phone account, in your name. Of course, they don’t pay the
bills and continue to use the phone until you discover the
theft and the heat is on; then they drop that account and
move on to another unsuspecting victim.

It comes in the mail
To steal your identity, the identity thief uses some of the infor-
mation you receive in the mail. In Table 1-1, I outline the most
vulnerable information that comes in the mail.

Your identity thief doesn’t 
have to be your twin
For those who remember the old
Mission Impossible TV show, many
episodes featured one of the IMF
(Impossible Mission Force) personnel
assuming the identity of an intended
target or someone close to the target.
In the show, the person assuming the
target’s identity would wear a mask
that resembled the target’s face and
would learn to speak and act like the
target. In real life, an impersonator
(the identity thief) doesn’t need to
look or act like you to steal your iden-
tity. All that’s needed is your personal
identification information and bingo:
He or she becomes you.
TV commercials for a major bank’s
credit card offer the best depiction of
this real-life situation. In the com-
mercials, you see the victims talking
to you about how much fun they’ve
had buying expensive vehicles,
taking lavish vacations, or whatever.
What you notice, though, is that the
voices you hear don’t match the
people you see on the screen: a male
voice emanates from a female, or
vice versa. The voice — gloating
over how wonderful it is to get the
goods and stick someone else with
the tab — is obviously coming from
the identity thief while you’re looking
at the victim.

The best way to minimize the amount of information you
receive in the mail — especially those preapproved credit
offers and the blank checks from the credit companies — is 
to opt-out. When you opt out, you remove yourself from mail
marketing lists. You can request that your bank not send pre-
approved checks, as well.
What you throw away 
can hurt you
When identity thieves go through the garbage of potential tar-
gets, it is called dumpster diving. The only tools needed are a
pair of gloves and a flashlight. (The favorite time to go on a
Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do 11

garbage hunt is after dark, and the thief must be able to stand
the smell — especially on a hot summer night.) The purpose of
dumpster diving is to find personal information that you dis-
card without tearing or shredding. What type of information,
you may be asking? The following list gives you the answer:
 Preapproved credit card applications: Throwing away
those preapproved credit card applications without tear-
ing, shredding or destroying them in some way is inviting
trouble. An Identity thief can retrieve the application
from your trash, send it in with the address changed, and
receive the new cards in your name, based on your credit.
After receiving your card, the thief charges items (or
cash advances) to the card up to its maximum in short
order. Then, he or she tosses the card and leaves you
with the bill.
 Credit card receipts: Although many businesses no longer
print your entire credit card number on your receipts,
some still do. Check your receipt — if it lists your credit
card number, don’t leave it behind to fall into the wrong
hands.
 Financial statements: Bank and other financial statements
containing your account numbers and (often) your SSN
are treasures that may lurk in the garbage unharmed and
waiting to be “liberated” by the identity thief.
The bottom line is to remember to destroy all personal infor-
mation before throwing it away. Tear, shred, or otherwise
destroy those preapproved credit card applications, financial
statements, credit card receipts, and so on. Don’t make your
house a dumpster diving gold mine; what you throw away can
come back to haunt you.
The Role of Technology 
in Identity Theft
Technology can play a role in helping you prevent identity
theft when you browse the Web, shop online, and log in and
out of secure Web sites. The two most common tools at your
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
12

disposal are encryption and authentication. If you know the
tricks to these tools, they can help you make sure your infor-
mation is safe when you’re online.
Encryption
Encryption uses digital keys to lock and unlock data while it’s
being transmitted over the Internet, which makes it incredibly
difficult for anyone but the intended recipient to see or tamper
with that data. With encryption, a key on the sending end
scrambles data, and a key on the receiving end unscrambles it.
While the data in en route, good encryption makes it virtually
impossible for outsiders to peek at or tamper with the data —
in your case, your personal and financial data. Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) is the standard form of data security on the
Internet. SSL uses digital certificates to verify that the two
computers in a transaction are who they claim to be before
exchanging the keys that encrypt the data.
Before you use your credit card to purchase merchandise
online — in fact, before you enter any of your data online —
you want to make sure the site uses 128-bit SSL to keep your
data secure. Checking this is easy — in the bottom-right
corner of your Web browser, just look for the lock shown in
Figure 1-1. If you hover your mouse pointer over the lock, you
may even see a ToolTip that says SSL 128. When you double-
click the lock, you see information similar to that shown in
Figure 1-2, which indicates that the site’s identity is authentic
and the data is encrypted.
Encryption can also be used to protect e-mail messages and
attachments as well as files of personal information that you
store on your PC or CD. The encryption software Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) has software that enables you to encrypt this
data yourself. PGP offers a freeware version (software that
you don’t have to pay for) for home use. (You can download
the freeware version at http://www.pgp.com/products/
freeware.html.) For about $50, PGP offers the software with
more features, such as the ability to encrypt content on your
hard drive when you’re not using it (you may want to do this
if, for example, you travel often with a laptop that might be
stolen or lost).
Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do 13

Figure 1-1: Picture of lock on Windows toolbar.
VeriSign offers another method to help you know that the Web
site you are on is authentic (that is, the site is who it says it is
and is encrypting data). You’re most likely to find the VeriSign
logo on the site’s privacy and security page. When you click the
VeriSign logo, you see a screen that tells you what security
measures that site is using through VeriSign.
Figure 1-2: Web site verification.

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
14

Because well-known names and logos like VeriSign offer
people assurance, of course, online scammers try to use them
in unscrupulous ways. Savvy identity thieves can forge a site,
copy a logo, or make their own digital certificates. Use SSL
and the VeriSign digital certificates and logo as one of many
tools to make sure the site you’re visiting really represents the
company or organization it claims to be, and see Chapter 9 for
more on spotting and avoiding online scams.
Authentication
Authentication is the method used to identify you when, for
example, you access your personal information on your PC,
Web sites for bank accounts, online bill paying services, and so
on. When you authenticate yourself to a PC or a secure Web
site, you enter a user name and a password or PIN to log in.
The best way to protect your identity through authentication
is by using a good password. Choose a password that is hard
to guess but one you will not need to write down. The pass-
word should include a minimum of eight characters using a
combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. An
example is TGIF!*49. If you have the opportunity to choose
secret questions to help prompt you in the event that you
forget your password, choose good questions that no one but
you can answer, like a favorite teacher. (People could have
access to your mother’s maiden name or spouse’s middle
name.)

Finding Your Allies
You are not alone in the fight against identity theft. From the
federal government and credit card companies to your local
police, your allies abound and can help you with many aspects
of identity theft. Here are some of your key sources of help:
 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC): The FTC provides
information useful for preventing identity theft and know-
ing what to do if you are a victim. Its Web site (www.
consumer.gov/idtheft) is chock full of statistics, infor-
mation, forms, and more to help you understand and pre-
vent identity theft as well as what to do if you’re a victim.
 The Social Security Administration (SSA): Has guide-
lines for reporting fraud on its Web site (http://www.
ssa.gov/). Also, you need to submit a fraud reporting
Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do 17

form to the SSA Office of Inspector General (OIG), which
is an investigative branch. The SSA recommends down-
loading the form, completing it, and then sending it via
fax or regular mail to ensure confidentiality.
 Most local law enforcement agencies: Provide informa-
tion on how to prevent identity theft and what to do if you
become a victim. For example, the City of Stockton, CA
Police Department, does seminars for employees at busi-
nesses in the city, and civic groups. They also provide tips
on their Web site: visit www.stocktongov.com and then
click Police Department. When you report the crime of
identity theft to the Stockton, CA Police Department, you
call the Telecommunications Center to file a report. The
report is taken over the phone. You will be given a report
number. Most active federal law enforcement agencies
investigating ID theft are the U.S. Postal Inspection Service
and the U.S. Secret Service.
 Internet Fraud Center (IFC): www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/fc/
ifcc/about/about_ifcc.htm. Is a partnership between
the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center. The
IFC does report the complaints to the proper local
authorities.
 Financial institutions and credit card companies: Most
financial institutions provide tips about preventing fraud
and knowing what to do if you are a victim. Some institu-
tions provide discounts and links to sites that charge an
annual membership fee for providing identity theft protec-
tion. For example, I subscribe to a service called Credit
Expert.com, and the site is part of the credit bureau
Experian. Chapter 6 has more details.
To help stem the upward trend of credit card fraud, the
card-issuing companies monitor and look for irregular
patterns of use. What you charge on a monthly basis is
monitored, and when something varies for the normal
pattern, the card company will call you and ask if you
made the purchase. For example, when people go on
vacation and do not notify the card company, they will
probably receive a call asking if they made a purchase in
X country or Y state. The card companies have used this
method for the last ten years, and it has helped reduce
some credit card fraud.
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
18

 Experienced attorneys: Although the resources I’ve just
listed are usually quite helpful, you may want to contact
an attorney to help you restore your credit and name if
creditors are not cooperative in removing fraudulent
accounts from your credit report or charges from
accounts. Contact the American Bar Association or Legal
Aid office in your area and ask for the names of attorneys
that specialize in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),
consumer law and the Fair Credit Billing Act.
Getting Back Your Identity 
and Your Good Reputation
If you have been a victim of identity theft, do not panic. There
are things you can do to restore your identity and good repu-
tation. However, it won’t be easy. Estimates of the time spent
on getting back your credit and good name are around 600
hours of work, according to a study done by the Identity Theft
Resource Center, a nonprofit organization (www.idtheft
center.org). The study found the 600-hour figure is a 300
percent increase from 2001, when people spent an average 
of 175–200 hours regaining their names and credit. 
After you suspect your identity has been stolen, you need to
take four steps as soon as possible and begin documenting
your case. The FTC outlines these first four steps on its iden-
tity theft site (www.ftc.gov/idtheft), as shown in Figure 1-3.
Following is a simplified version of the steps that the FTC 
outlines:
1. Place a fraud alert on your credit reports and
review the credit reports that you receive as a
result.
You can contact any one of the three major credit
bureaus to place the fraud alert.
2. Close any accounts that have been tampered with or
opened fraudulently.
3. File a report with your local police or the police in
the community where the identity theft took place.
Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do 19

Figure 1-3: Take these steps right away if you think your identity has been
stolen.
4. File a complaint with the FTC.
Chapter 3 gives more details about this four-step
process for reporting and thwarting identity theft. 
In Chapter 10, I explain the details of filling out the
required reports. Chapter 11 has helpful information
for speeding up the process of closing accounts.
As you begin the process of reclaiming your identity, the paper
work will start to roll in and out of your life. Keeping a good
paper trail will help you assemble and support your case. The
Identity Theft Resource Center (www.idtheftcenter.org)
offers some helpful guidelines for organizing the data. The FTC
also gives you tips for organizing your case. The tips shown on
the FTC Web site are as follows:
 Follow up in writing with all contacts you’ve made on the
phone or in person. Use certified mail, return receipt
requested.
 Keep copies of all correspondence or forms you send.
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
20

 Write down the name of anyone you talk to, what he or
she told you, and the date the conversation occurred.
 Keep the originals of supporting documentation, like
police reports, and letters to and from creditors; send
copies only.
 Set up a filing system for easy access to your paperwork.
 Keep old files even if you believe your case is closed. 
One of the most difficult and annoying aspects of identity
theft is that errors can reappear on your credit reports or
your information can be recirculated. Should this
happen, you’ll be glad you kept your files.

Discovering Where Your Personal
Information Hides
Your personal information can be found in more locations
than you probably realize. Table 2-1 outlines some of the 
locations your personal information is located. The table is
not all-inclusive, but it gives you a pretty good idea of where
personal information is commonly stored.

The important info on the 
documents you receive
You receive various documents every day. Some are sent by
mail, some are handed to you, and others arrive by e-mail.
Many of these documents contain information that is useful to
an identity thief.

Awareness is your first line of defense against identity theft.
Being organized and keeping track of the statements and
reports you receive is important if you are to protect yourself
against identity theft. Consider the following:
 Credit card statements: Your credit card statements
have your name, the credit card company’s name and
phone number, your address, account number, credit
limit, and expiration date printed on it. Using just the
information printed on the statement, an identity thief
can purchase items online or on the phone. The thief can
also request a change of address and have the bills come
directly to them, although most banks confirm a change
of address with a follow-up telephone call or letter.
Your credit card statements list all your purchases and
payments for the last month’s billing period. By checking
your statements regularly, you can determine whether
someone else is making charges on your card.
 Bank statements: Bank statements have the account
numbers and balances, your name and address, and the
name of your bank. If you receive direct deposit pay-
checks, some banks even print your SSN on your check-
ing account statement. The checking account statement
has information about your account activity and, if you
choose, all the canceled checks that have been paid by
the bank in your name are enclosed with the statement.
Use your bank statement as a tool in detecting identity
theft. Review the account monthly so that you know
immediately if there are withdrawals you did not make.
 Paycheck stubs: Paycheck stubs for direct deposit have
personal information on them, including your name,
address, rate of pay, and your employer’s name. Some
also have your SSN. Shred the stubs after you check your
bank account statement to make sure that the right
amount of the deposit has been recorded.
 Investment statements: Your 401K statements have a
great deal of information, including your name, address,
account number, balance, and the name of the company
that is managing the account. IRA accounts may contain
your SSN. If you have an account with a stockbroker, the
quarterly statements have the same information as an
IRA or 401K. You should keep the first statement after
Chapter 2: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal Information 25

you opened the account, and then keep two to three
years of current statements and shred the rest. The
reason to keep the current year’s statement is to check
that your money is not leaving the account without your
approval or knowledge. Do not just throw your invest-
ment statements away — they contain too much per-
sonal information.
 Social Security statement: On an annual basis, we all
receive an account statement from the Social Security
Administration. This statement has your SSN as well as
your DOB, address, and current balance with the pro-
jected amount you will receive if you work until you are
62 or 65. Because these are annual statements, you can
keep more of them. They are not bulky, so you can keep
all of them until retirement if you like, but keeping the
most current twenty years’ worth is probably sufficient.
At minimum, you should keep them to compare numbers
year to year.
 Tax information (W-2s, interest accounts, 1099s, and 
so on): These are the most vulnerable tax documents,
because they have the most information. They have your
name, your address, your employer’s name and address,
your pay for the year, and your SSN. Tax information is
useful to identity thieves because the form has your and
your spouse’s SSN, your home address, place of employ-
ment, pay rate, and so on — all of which can be used to
assume your identity. Keep copies of your tax returns for
at least five years in a locked file cabinet or safe. This
helps minimize theft.
In addition to statements, most folks receive the following
documents by mail:
 Pre-approved credit card offers
 Driver’s license renewal forms
 Utility bills
 Direct deposit pay check stubs
 Blank checks for your personal checking account
These documents have personal information, and they come
in the mail — which is vulnerable.

Finding your information online
Finding your information online is not that difficult. All you
have to do is access public records Web sites, and you can
find some information. If you own a house, for example, the
address, parcel number, the mortgage company, the amount
borrowed to purchase, and the purchase price, and the taxes
paid or owed on the property are all on file at the county
clerk’s office. Table 2-2 outlines where personal information
can be found online.

Problems with My Mail
Mail napping, stealing mail to get
information about someone to be
used for monetary gain, is one way
the identity thief can get his or her
hands on your mail and consequently
your personal information. In 2002,
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service
handled approximately 84,000 mail
fraud complaints and made 5,448
arrests for mail theft. In 2003, the
Postal Inspection Service made 6,000
mail theft suspect arrests. 
It is hard to say if this is just the tip of
the iceberg. For every mail thief
caught, there may be several more
that are still out there preying on the
mail. Even with the good records of the
Postal Inspection Service, parts of 
the country are experiencing volume
thefts. These thefts occur in Tucson
and Phoenix, AZ, parts of California,
and parts of Texas. The thefts include
mail trucks, collection boxes, apart-
ment mailbox panels, co-op mailing
racks, and neighborhood delivery and
collection units. The mail is stolen to
get your checks, credit card applica-
tions, and bank statements.
Protect your mail: Don’t leave it in the
box overnight or for extended periods
of time — not even in a locked mail-
box. Be stingy and keep all your mail
for yourself!

lished phone number.
Real estate owned 
Public records county clerk’s office
Previous and current 
Record search Web sites, such as 
addresses
completedetective.com and

Your online investment accounts
address, account numbers, 
balances, and more
Your name, address, and 
Your online banking accounts
account numbers
Criminal and civil court 
Public databases
records
Web sites exist where you can pay a fee to obtain information
about yourself. The number of searches you request deter-
mines the amount of the fee. You can search criminal records,
the county clerk’s office, and so on. All you need to do is type
in your SSN, DOB, name, and address. The site will search
through public records for criminal convictions, civil suits,
bankruptcies, and so on. Keep in mind that thieves can search
this information, too.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs access to finan-
cial records, so the search Web sites are not permitted to run
financial inquiries. The FCRA requires your permission to run
a credit and financial check. You sign a form to grant permis-
sion to a prospective employer, car dealership, or mortgage
company to run a credit and financial check. Without the
form, they cannot legally run a check.
The FCRA also requires that if derogatory information appears
in the report, you receive a copy so you can contest its con-
tents. Chapter 3 discusses recent changes to the FCRA.

Accounts you have online
In this Internet age, having accounts that are managed online
is commonplace. Using your computer to manage your
accounts is fast and easy. The accounts that you may have
online include the following:
 Bank accounts (savings and checking)
 Accounts for your bill paying service
 Insurance (homeowners, auto, life, and health)
 Investment accounts, such as 401K, mutual funds, and
others 
 Individual accounts with online merchants
 Services like PayPal services
Any account you can access online has the potential to be
compromised. To access the account, you generally use a PIN
(personal identification number, or password). Sometimes the
PIN is all numeric, and sometimes it consists of alphanumeric
characters.
The danger with online accounts is having a weak PIN, pass-
word, or one you need to write down. Once an identity thief
figures out your password or PIN, he or she can access your
accounts as easily as you do. Money can be withdrawn from
the account or moved to other accounts; the accounts can be
closed out.
The most secure combination of characters for a PIN or pass-
word is a combination of letters, numbers, and special charac-
ters, such as TGIF29#$!.
Checks, receipts, and other 
paper you generate
For people who live in a “paperless” society, we still generate
a great deal of paper. For example, we generate checks, ATM
receipts, credit card purchase receipts, and debit card pur-
chase receipts, to name just a few. How you treat the impor-
tant paper you generate will either make you more vulnerable
or less vulnerable to identity theft. Table 2-3 highlights the
paper you generate.

before discarding them. Don’t make your information easily

ticing prevention. The best defense is shredding.
Government documents
If you look in your wallet, you will probably find at least one
government document — your driver’s license. You may be
surprised to find how many government documents you have,
and the importance of each, when you see the following list:
 Driver’s license: In addition to your driver’s license
number, your driver’s license contains your name,
address, eye color, hair color, height, weight, and your
date of birth. You show it to police officers even when
you are not driving and at airports to pass through secu-
rity checkpoints. Your driver’s license is usually
requested when you purchase merchandise by personal
check. In fact, the cashier often writes the driver’s license
number on the check.
Because your driver’s license contains so much personal
information, it is advisable to cut up the old one into little
pieces that cannot be put back together. The ID thief can
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
30

make up a phony driver’s license with your details to
open an account in your name, use your stolen personal
checks, or cash fake checks in your name.
 Birth certificate: Your birth certificate proves that you
are a U.S. citizen. It contains your mother’s maiden name;
your father’s name; city and state you were born in; time,
day, and year you were born. You need a birth certificate
to get passport, state ID card, and so on. To be safe, store
your birth certificates in a locked file cabinet or safety
deposit box.
 Passport: The passport is also an important document. 
It has your picture, full name, and address, and it proves
that you are a citizen of the United States. You show your
passport when you travel abroad. You show it to customs
when you arrive in another country and upon return to
the United States. Your passport can be used by terrorists
attempting to gain entry into the country or other crimi-
nals. If your passport is lost domestically, it can be sold to
someone else and used to establish citizenship. It should
be stored in a safety deposit box or locked file cabinet.
 Auto registration form: The auto registration form has
your full name and address on it as a proof of ownership.
The ID thief can use your name and information to pur-
chase an automobile and your name and maybe even
your address will appear on the auto registration. When
you leave your car, be sure to lock it!
 State ID cards: State ID cards are used as identification
for people who don’t have a driver’s license. In addition
to your ID number, it contains your name, address, and
date of birth.
To open a bank account at most banks, two forms of ID are
required; a current (unexpired) driver’s license or current
passport is one form of ID, and the other is typically either a
birth certificate or unexpired credit card.
Keeping Your Information 
Safe but Available
Storing your personal information should be done so the
information is secure from theft but easily accessible by you.
Chapter 2: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal Information 31

The information should be handy for you to access but diffi-
cult for the identity thief.
Software to help keep 
your information safe
When you store the information on your PC, you should pro-
tect it with the following:
 Antivirus software: This software scans your computer
for viruses (programs that are intended to harm your
computer system), and removes them from your
machine. You usually end up with a virus (or a worm or a
trojan horse) when you open a seemingly innocent e-mail
attachment that in fact harbors the little devil. Two popu-
lar antivirus programs are Norton Antivirus and McAfee
VirusScan. Most new computers come with some sort of
antivirus software preinstalled.
 Firewall: A firewall heads off destructive programs at the
pass. You can use the options that come with your firewall
software to restrict applications’ with inbound and out-
bound access to your computer and the Internet. Norton
and McAfee offer firewall software at a reasonable price.
 File encryption: Encrypting the files you store on CD and
on your PC is the best way to secure them electronically.
Many types of personal encryption software are avail-
able. I use PGP encryption for e-mail and find it easy to
use. 
 Password-protection: Be sure to protect sensitive docu-
ments with a password.
Tips to keep your information safe
In addition to using software, you can use the following tips to
protect your information:
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
32

 You can store files on a CD and lock the CD in a fire-rated
safe that is either tethered to a secure anchor or heavy
enough to prevent it from being easily taken from your
house.
 You can store a copy of a CD in a bank safety deposit box.
 Do not store your personal information on a Web site or in
e-mail files. E-mails can be captured and read by anyone.
Web site links in e-mails are used to get the recipient to
divulge personal information that is captured by the iden-
tity thief.
 Be careful about storing personal information on your
laptop hard drive. If the laptop gets stolen or lost, the
information will be lost or compromised.
 Know the Web sites and companies you purchase mer-
chandise from and make sure they use SSL or some other
form of encryption to transmit personal data.
 Be wary of any Web sites that ask for personal information
before you can access their site. The Web site owners 
may be using a legitimate marketing tool, but you need to
consider what they do with the information that they col-
lect. Is the information sold? How secure is the server they
are storing all the information they collected about you?
Read the Web site owners’ privacy policy before you give
them any personal information. The privacy policy will
let you know how they will treat the information they col-
lect. The privacy policy will give you the opportunity to
opt-out if the Web site owners are going to share the
information with anyone else.
Accessing your information
No matter how you store personal information — either
online or on hard copy — you need to be able to access the
Chapter 2: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal Information 33

information easily. Here’s a simple plan to help you ensure
that you can access your information when you need it:
 Make a list of all your credit account numbers, issuing
company names, and contact information. Do the same
thing for your bank accounts and investment accounts.
Also keep a record of the current balances, your Social
Security card, and your birth certificate. Keep copies of
your tax returns, as well.
 Put the hard copies of the list in a safe location — a fire-
proof safe or a bank safety deposit box. If the information
is on a CD, keep the CD in a safe location.
 If you need the information, you now have it in one 
place — no need to panic when you need it.
When you update the information, make sure that you destroy
any hard copies before discarding them. You do not want this
information to fall into the wrong hands.
Knowing When to Hold ’Em,
When to Fold ’Em, and 
When to Shred ’Em
If we live in paperless society, why do we generate so much
more paper than we did 20 years ago? The answer is simple:
With computers, it’s easier to produce documents. And what’s
better than documents? I’ll tell you what — more documents!
That said, some of the paper generated is important, and you
must know what to keep, where to keep it, and for how long.
What to keep
Table 2-4 provides a quick guide for you to use when consider-
ing which documents to keep. The list after the table provides
more detail on each item.

Here are some additional points to keep in mind:
 Personal checks that are needed as a receipt for tax 
purposes should be kept with your tax records. These
records should be kept in a file cabinet that is fireproof.
Chapter 2: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal Information 35

The tax returns should also be kept in the same file cabi-
net. The checks and tax returns should be kept for five
years as required by the IRS.
 Bank account statements for your personal checking
account should be kept for at least six months to com-
pare to the next month’s statement. The account state-
ment can be kept in a fire rated file cabinet.
 Your savings account statements should be kept for at
least one year to check the balance in the account. If the
account is an interest bearing account, as most are, then
you will receive a tax statement of how much interest
was paid for the year from the bank at the end of the year
to file with your tax return. The copy of this document
should be kept with your tax return.
 Investment account statements should be kept for as
long as you have the account. This is a good way to track
your balance from quarter to quarter.
I use my statements for comparison, and I review them.
Reviewing the account statement frequently is an excel-
lent way to see if someone has been siphoning money
from your account — which means that they have your
account number and information.
The best place to store account statements is in your file
cabinet drawers. These files are helpful for reviewing the
account activity and for making decisions on whether to
move the money to another account. I file quarterly
account records from my securities and investment
accounts in a large loose-leaf binder book by date for
ease of reviewing.
 Keep your credit card statements and receipts for the
current two months. The receipts should be used to rec-
oncile your statement and to make sure you made all of
the charges that appear on the statement. If you did not
make any of the charges, now is the time to dispute them
with your credit card company. (You have 90 days from
the date of the statement to dispute a charge.)
 Keep paycheck stubs from direct deposit by your
employer. If you do not keep them, they should be
destroyed before being discarded. If you keep the stubs,
they should be kept in the file cabinet with your tax
returns and then destroyed before being discarded.
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
36

 Any mortgage documents, deeds, or lease agreements
should be kept in a fireproof storage box at home or the
safety deposit box at the bank. These documents should
be kept for as long as you own or are renting the prop-
erty. The mortgage payment book and slips should be
kept as well as any statements showing the account
activity. Any rent receipts you receive as well as the can-
celled checks should be kept as a record of payment.
When you move and the documents are no longer
needed, destroy them before discarding.
 Vehicle purchase agreements and loan papers should be
kept in the file cabinet. This is true whether the vehicle is
new or used. If you purchased the vehicle from another
private party, keep the sales agreement. When you finally
pay off the loan on a vehicle purchased using a loan, be
sure to file the pink slip in the safety deposit box. The
pink slip needs to be kept and transferred to the new
owner when you sell the vehicle. The loan papers, how-
ever, can be destroyed and discarded.
 Vehicle and homeowners insurance policies should be
kept in a safety deposit box or locking file cabinet. The
information contained in the policy coverage statement
is important. So when you discard the old policy, destroy
it before you throw it away.
 Life insurance policies contain personal information and
should be kept locked in a file cabinet or safety deposit
box. Destroy outdated policies before you discard them.
Best practices for destroying 
what you don’t keep
We have been talking a great deal about destroying the docu-
ments you want to discard that contain personal information.
Any documents containing personal information need to be
destroyed before being discarded to prevent your personal
information from falling into the wrong hands.
Dumpster diving, as covered in Chapter 1, is a real threat. You
may think that no one would go through dirty smelly garbage
cans, but they do. They do because it works. They find per-
sonal information and use it to steal your identity. The good
news is that heading thieves off at the pass is as simple as
Chapter 2: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal Information 37

destroying your documents before you discard them. Here are
the best ways to do it:
 Shred the documents. Shredders are the best and most
effective method for destroying documents. Some of
these shredders are actually powerful enough to shred
credit cards. You can purchase a shredder at discount
department and office supply stores.
The best shredder to purchase is one that will make the
documents look like confetti and not just like strips. The
long strips can be pieced together and the personal infor-
mation can then be read and used.
After the documents are shredded, place the contents
from the shredder can into a plastic bag, and put the bag
in the bottom of your garbage can.
Make sure that you follow the safety directions and pre-
cautions in the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid
mishaps.
 Use a permanent marker to mark out personal informa-
tion, and then tear up the documents. The next best way
to destroy the unwanted documents is to take a perma-
nent marker and mark out any personal information, and
then tear the document up. Do not just mark out the per-
sonal information with the permanent marker and leave it
at that; also tear up the document into small pieces
before discarding. This way, you ensure that the docu-
ment does not yield any information to an identity thief.
 Tear or cut up the documents into small pieces. Tear or
cut up the documents if you do not have a shredder. Make
sure that you tear or cut up the documents into small
pieces so they cannot be taped back together easily.
 Cut up the expired or cancelled credit cards and
driver’s licenses. Cut up those expired credit cards and
driver’s licenses. Do not put them in the trash in one
piece, or you only invite trouble. Cut the cards and
driver’s licenses into tiny pieces that cannot be taped
together easily. Do not throw them away without cutting
them up so the card number cannot be used by any one
else to make purchases on the phone or online.
Destroy documents that contain personal information that
you do not want to keep. This will help keep you from becom-
ing a victim of identity theft.

Buy and use a shredder
Investing in a shredder is worth the money. You can purchase
one at a local discount store for around $40.00. Make sure that
the one you purchase shreds the papers so that they cannot
be easily taped back together. The shredder should shred the
document into confetti-like material. This way, you don’t have
strips of paper that can be put back together. The identity thief
is looking for an easy way to obtain information, and if you
shred your documents they will look for an easier target. So
by purchasing and using a shredder religiously to shred any
documents that contain personal information you will become
a harder target. I have a shredder and use it all the time to
shred any documents that I don’t need or my family doesn’t
need or want that contain personal information.
Make a habit of shredding the following documents:
 The monthly credit card statement after you have paid
the bill.
 Bank statements and 401K statements. You don’t need to
keep every statement you have ever received from your
401K plan just the first and the most recent three years.
 Pay stubs from work (after you check your monthly
checking statements to make sure the deposit amount 
on the statement is correct).
 Unwanted credit card applications.
Order and review your 
credit report
As an identity theft prevention method, you should order 
and review your credit report at least annually. As outlined 
in Table 3-2 later in this chapter, you are entitled to one free
annual credit report from each of the three credit bureaus.
Chapter 6 provides details about how to order and read a
credit report. (This will not stop identity theft, but will help
you catch it if it has already happened.)
The revisions to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, entitling con-
sumers to one free credit report per year, were signed into 
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
42

law in December 2003. There is a phased regional rollout plan
that starts on the West coast and adds another region every
quarter. Here is the schedule:
 Western states: December 1, 2004
 Twelve Midwest states: March 1, 2005
 Eleven southern states: June 1, 2005
 All remaining states: September 1, 2005
Reviewing a credit report is a good way to detect whether
someone is using your name to obtain credit. Simply examine
the section of the report that summarizes inquiries made by
others. Do you recognize the inquiries? Did you make or initi-
ate them? If not, you could be the victim of identity theft.
Look for accounts that you have open but have not used for 
a long period of time, and close the accounts. This will keep
the accounts from being used by someone without your
knowledge.
Guard your personal information
Don’t carry more personal information than is necessary. The
more information you carry, the greater chance that it will be
stolen. Here are some brief guidelines for what to carry and
what to leave behind. Chapter 8 provides more detail, as well.
 Don’t carry your Social Security Card with you all the
time. If you need the card for identity purposes for a 
new job, then take it with you but guard it. When you
return home at the end of the day, take the card from
your wallet or purse and put it back in its secure storage
place.
 Don’t carry personal checks with you unless you are
going shopping. When you carry personal checks, make
sure that you guard them. You don’t want blank checks
falling into the wrong hands.
 Carry only one credit card with you. You can easily keep
track of one card. If you carry several and don’t use some
of them, you may forget that you have them and not real-
ize that they are missing if they are lost or stolen.
Chapter 3: Mike’s Anti-Identity-Theft Crash Course 43

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
44
 Be stingy with your personal information. Do not give out
personal information to anyone who asks; always verify
the identity of the person asking for the information. An
identity thief can obtain the information through what is
known as social engineering. Social engineering is the art
of obtaining more information by using a minimal amount
of information to fool the person. For example, knowing
your pet’s or children’s names may help the person find
out their birth dates, which you may be using as a PIN.
Opting out of pre-approved 
credit card offers
By receiving pre-approved credit applications in the mail, you
increase your chances of becoming a victim of identity theft.
All the identity thief needs to do is to steal the application
from your mailbox, complete it, and send it in. The thief will
use their address, so you will not even get the bills.
You can opt out of pre-approved credit card applications 
by calling the toll-free number, (888) 567-8688. The call takes
30 seconds. You can opt out for two years or permanently,
and you can opt-in at any time.
When you call, an automated system prompts you for informa-
tion. One call will remove you from the lists at all three major
credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union. I did it,
and it is quick, easy, and worth doing. The recording says that
the request goes into effect in five business days.
About five business days after the call, you will receive a letter
asking whether the name and address is correct on the form.
If the name and address is correct, sign and date the form and
send it to the opt-out department. If your name and address
are incorrect, simply make corrections on the form where indi-
cated, sign and date it, and return it. The letter does not come
with a stamped self-addressed envelope for returning the con-
firmation. You need to supply the envelope and the stamp.
To opt out from your own financial institutions and your own
credit card company, you need to contact them separately;
contacting the three major credit bureaus won’t do the trick.

Government Laws to Protect You
The changes to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act
(FACT Act) became law on December 2003 (changes take effect
December 2004). Table 3-2 outlines the changes.
FACT is the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. It pro-
vides better protection to you the consumer against the fallout
from being a victim of identity theft. Following are some of the
key provisions of the FACT Act. Table 3-2 provides additional
information.
 You are entitled to one free credit report from each 
credit bureau annually. Note that this law goes into effect
December 2004 with a phased rollout by region of the
country, as described previously in this chapter.
 If are the victim of identity theft, you are entitled to addi-
tional free credit reports.
 If you are a victim of identity theft, you need to make only
one call to receive advice and set a national fraud alert to
protect your credit rating. The fraud alert requests credi-
tors to contact you before opening any new accounts or
making any changes to your existing accounts. As soon
as the credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the other
two credit bureaus will be automatically notified to place
fraud alerts, and all three credit reports will be sent to
you free of charge.
 As a victim, if you file a police report you will be able to
block fraudulent information from appearing on your
credit report.
 As a victim, you will have access to business records that
list and identify the thief’s fraudulent transactions.
 The credit reporting agencies must ensure that all
requests for credit are legitimate after you flag your
report as suspected of being a victim of identity theft.

Chapter 3: Mike’s Anti-Identity-Theft Crash Course 47
 Any person on active military duty overseas can place
special alerts on their reports while deployed overseas.
 Lenders and creditors are required to take action even
before the victim realizes they are a victim of identity
theft.
 Debt collectors are now required to report fraudulent
information to creditors.

Steps to Take If You 
Are a Victim
Sometimes, identity theft cannot be prevented. Here’s how it
can happen. An insider — someone who works for a retailer,
credit card company, bank, Department of Motor Vehicles, or
Social Security Administration — sells your information to the
identity thief. This scenario occurs with low frequency, but it
does occur. There is not much you can do to prevent a situa-
tion like this one. That is why you need to remain vigilant and
check your accounts and your credit report regularly.
If you discover that you are a victim, do not panic. If you are
diligent about checking your accounts, monthly bills, and
reading your credit report at least once per year, you will 
discover early on whether you have been a victim. Early dis-
covery makes it easier to address the issue and get your 
good name back.
Table 3-3 outlines the steps you must take if you discover 
that you are a victim of identity theft. The sections following
Table 3-3 provide more detail for each of the steps.
How I caught up with a thief
Several years ago I had a credit card
that someone else was using without
my authorization or knowledge. I dis-
covered it by reviewing my monthly
statement. There were several charges
on the card I did not make. To remedy
the situation, I called the card com-
pany and they immediately removed
the charges and sent me a letter stat-
ing that they were investigating the
disputed charges and if they were
found to be legitimate, they would add
the amount back into my balance. The
charges were fraudulent and recurred
for several months, so the card com-
pany recommended that I cancel the
card, which I did. They issued a new
one immediately with a new account
number and transferred any legitimate
charges pending to the new account.
My credit report reflected the credit
card account was closed due to fraud,
and the new account was listed above
the closed one.

Reporting the crime 
to law enforcement
Reporting the crime to law enforcement used to be a chore.
Not all states have passed legislation to mandate that local
law enforcement agencies take reports of identity theft, but
most law enforcement agencies will take reports because of
all the recent publicity regarding identity theft.
To report identity theft in most jurisdictions, you call the local
law enforcement agencies non-violent non-emergency phone
line. Do not call 911; the crime is not a life-threatening situation.
The phone book or local law enforcement agency Web site has
phone numbers to specifically report these types of crimes.

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
50
After you make the call, the agency may send someone to take
the report. In California, most jurisdictions do not even send 
a sworn officer when your car has been stolen — they send a
community services officer. This probably follows for an iden-
tity theft case. Regardless, you will have a report number to
file with your theft affidavit.
After the report is taken, it is assigned to the detective bureau
or squad responsible for the type of crime reported. A detective
will open a case file and may do a follow up contact with you.
You need to send the report number and a copy of the report
to the credit bureaus as well as all those businesses that have
opened credit or sold merchandise that was unauthorized.
Other essential actions 
you must take
Here are some other things you must do immediately if you
discover that your identity has been stolen:
 Place a fraud alert on your credit report. This is an
important step in regaining your good name and credit.
Chapter 10 provides more detail about this topic.
 Close compromised accounts. If you discover that you
have been a victim and some of your accounts have been
compromised, close them immediately. See Chapter 11
for more details.
 Call your credit card company. If you review your
monthly statement and find an item you want to dispute,
call the credit card company. Chapter 11 provides more
information about compromised accounts.
 Contact your bank. Call your bank if a discrepancy exists
on your monthly checking account or savings account
statement.
 File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.
The Federal Trade Commission has a complaint form on
their Web site (www.ftc.gov).

Determining
Whether You’re 
a Victim

In this part . . .
H
ow do you know if you’re a victim? Well, there are
signs to look for, such as a sudden change in your
credit score for no apparent reason. You need to know how
to order and interpret your credit report and what to look
for on the report that may signal that someone else is using
your credit. I cover all this and more in Part II.

I
n this chapter, I tell you how to recognize the signs that
you are a victim of identity theft. The signs of identity 
theft I outline are the first signs people typically notice, but
you can also find clues in your bank statements, investment
statements, and credit report. What you don’t know can hurt
you! For details on what to look for in bank and investment
statements, see Chapter 5. For details on credit reports, see
Chapter 6.
Suspecting a Thief 
at Your Mailbox
You know your normal billing cycle, and when your bills don’t
arrive on time, you need to find out why. You could be the
victim of mail theft.
There is an old saying that nothing is definite except taxes and
death, well, I would like to improvise on that and say there is
nothing definite except taxes and bills. When your bills don’t

Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
54
arrive on schedule, you need to be concerned. Don’t panic;
simply follow these steps:
1. Contact your creditors.
Call your credit card company, gas card company, and
all the others that are late, and find out if the bill is late
for some reason (keep in mind that bills are almost
never sent out late). Also ask when the bill was sent.
2. Contact the post office and let them know that you
suspect you are the victim of mail theft.
Offer the missed billing cycle and the information from
the company you contacted about when the bill was
sent to the post office.
Besides your bills, you also receive bank statements regularly.
Check your files to see when you last received your bank state-
ments. If you have not received the statements monthly, you
might be the victim of mail theft. Contact your bank and ask
when your statements were sent.
To help track bills on different cycles, you can use the calendar
feature in Microsoft Outlook. You can enter the date the bill
arrives and then determine when the next is due. Most bills
are on a 30-day cycle. After you get the receipt for the bill,
make an entry on the next month’s calendar and check the
recurring event feature. You can also check the notification
box so you will receive an audible notification on that day. If
you don’t have access to the Microsoft Outlook calendar fea-
ture, you can use any calendar to enter the information.
Recognizing When Something 
Is Wrong, and What You 
Can Do About It
There’s no question about it. It pays to monitor your bills
every month using the credit card receipts for the month.
This is your first line of defense against credit card fraud 
and identity theft.

Here are the general steps you need to take if you notice
charges you have not authorized on your bill:
1. Call your credit card company and dispute the
charge.
Ask for the credit card fraud department. Let them
know that you have been a victim of identity theft.
Then point out what charges you are disputing and
why. Make sure that you get the name of the person
you are speaking to, correct spelling, and so on. Write
it down for future reference. Follow-up your phone
conversation with a dispute letter. You will receive a
letter in the mail from the credit card company outlin-
ing your conversation and listing the disputed charges.
(See the section on “Large unknown purchases” later
in this chapter for more details.)
For large dollar charge disputes, you should follow up
your phone conversation with a letter disputing the
charge. 
2. File a dispute letter, as shown in Figure 4-1.
3. Order a credit report and review it carefully.
Dispute any unknown charges and information. Place a
fraud alert on your credit report if you suspect you are
the victim of identity theft. Turn to Chapter 6 for a run-
down on how to interpret your credit report.
4. Review all your bank statements and balances to
make sure they are correct and show no signs of
tampering.
If you see signs of tampering, have your bank freeze
the accounts. For example, look for withdrawals from
your account you did not make.
5. If you suspect that you are the victim of identity
theft, complete an identity theft affidavit, and send it
to all of your credit accounts and your bank.
The following sections describe the most common ways that
people realize their credit card or identity is being used with-
out their authorization, and what you can do in each instance
to reclaim your good credit.

Denied credit for a large purchase
The setting is a car dealership. You have the type, model, and
color car you have longed for. You test drive it, and you make
an offer to the salesperson. You haggle for a time and finally
come to an agreement. You complete the loan application. The
salesperson says it will take a few minutes to run your credit
report. After what seems to be an eternity, the salesperson
comes back and says, “I have bad news: You were not approved
for the loan.” You say, “But that can’t be — I have good credit.”

Sincerely,
Your name
Enclosures: (List what you are enclosing)

You are permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act to know
the reason why you were turned down for the loan. After you
review your credit report you find credit card accounts you
didn’t know you had, and you own two other cars you have
never driven or seen for that matter. What has happened here
is that you are the victim of identity theft and didn’t know it.
Now your work is just beginning. You must get back your good
name and credit.
This scenario actually happened to an individual and was told
to me by that person. The scenario can happen to you, espe-
cially if you have good credit. I can’t stress it enough: You need
to know if someone is using your credit and name without your
knowledge, and one of the best ways to detect the theft early
is to review your credit report regularly. Chapter 6 explains
how to order and read your credit report.
It is important to review your credit report at least annually, as
well as to review your credit card and bank statements regu-
larly. By regularly, I mean every month. When you perform the
checks consistently, you will know immediately if something
is wrong. The sooner you find out, the easier it is to minimize
the fallout.
Receiving credit card bills from
cards you didn’t apply for
In your mail today, you receive a surprise bill from a credit card
you didn’t apply for or didn’t even know you had. The charges
on the card are for things you haven’t purchased and for a trip
to a place you have never been. Something is wrong. You are
thinking it is probably a mistake. You double-check the name
and address on the bill, and sure enough, it has your name and
address.
Here is what you should do right away.
1. Order your credit report and review it carefully.
2. Place a fraud alert on your credit report.
3. Complete a fraud affidavit and send it to the credit
card company that sent the bill.
Chapter 4: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing When You Are a Victim 57

After you send the fraud affidavit, call the credit card company
and have the card cancelled, but do not be persuaded to pay
off the balance if you didn’t open the account and make the
charges.
If the company attempts to pressure you into paying, just tell
them that you are filing a complaint with the FTC and remind
them of the FACT Act provision that they cannot demand pay-
ment if you have been the victim of identity theft and have
identified the charge as fraudulent.
Receiving calls from bill collectors
for stuff you did not buy
You are watching your favorite TV show, when suddenly the
telephone rings. It is a bill collector calling about a delinquent
bill. You have no idea what the caller is talking about. You start
checking, but you know you didn’t purchase the item the bill
collector is talking about. Here is what you should do right
away.
 Take a deep breath.
 Order a credit report and review it carefully. Dispute any
unknown charges and information. Place a fraud alert on
your credit report if you suspect you are the victim of
identity theft.
 Call your credit card company and get the new charges
since the last billing cycle. Dispute any charges that are
not yours.
 Review all your bank statements and balances to make
sure they are correct and show no signs of tampering. If
you see signs of tampering, have your bank freeze the
accounts.
 If you suspect that you are the victim of identity theft,
complete an identity theft affidavit, and send it to all of
your credit accounts and your bank.
Receiving a call from a bill collector about a delinquent bill 
for something you never purchased is a definite sign that
something is wrong. If this happens, you most likely are the
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
58

victim of identity theft, and you need to address the situation
immediately.
Receiving bills for unknown 
purchases
The mail arrives you open it and there is a bill for a plasma
screen TV for $4,500. You look at the bill and say to yourself,
what is this? I didn’t buy a plasma screen TV at the XYZ store on
an XYZ store credit card. You call the store’s credit department
to inquire about the purchase. They say that you made the
purchase in their Seattle, Washington, store on xx/xx/xx date.
You live in Spokane, Washington, and you were not in Seattle
on the day of the purchase. Besides, you never received any
plasma screen TV. When you inquire further, you find out that
the plasma TV was shipped to an address in the Seattle area
that you have never heard of. You tell the store retail credit
representative that you are going to dispute the charge.
You order your credit report, and there is the XYZ store credit
card account in the credit history of your report. It also con-
tains the date the account was opened, which was the date of
the purchase. You file a fraud affidavit that shows you were at
work on the date of the purchase — you were not in Seattle —
and you send it to the XYZ store credit department. Then you
call the store credit department and ask them to close the
account.
Now you should follow up with a written identity theft affi-
davit to the store credit department to close the loop. Also
place a fraud alert on your report immediately. Then order a
credit report from the other two credit bureaus to see if there
are any other accounts that have been opened in your name.
Immediately send an Identity Affidavit to any account opened
without your knowledge. The fraud alert will stop creditors
from opening accounts without your knowledge. You will have
to verify your identity and approve all new accounts while the
alert is in place.
Next check with the Social Security Administration to see if
your SSN was used to obtain a job.
Chapter 4: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing When You Are a Victim 59

Then inquire at the U.S. Post Office to find if a change of
address form was filed on your behalf and report the informa-
tion to the Postal Inspectors (the Law Enforcement Division 
of the Post Office).
Finally, keep a record of all the correspondence, phone con-
versations, affidavits sent, etc.
Receiving bills in the mail with your name and address for pur-
chases you didn’t make is an indication that you are probably
the victim of identity theft.
Large unknown purchases 
on your credit card bills
When you review your monthly credit card bill, check it against
your credit card receipts for the month. If you notice a large
charge for something you didn’t authorize, contact your credit
card company immediately.
1. Look at the date of the purchase, the location, and
the amount. Tell the representative you didn’t make
or authorize the purchase.
The disputed charge will be removed from the current
month’s bill, and it will be investigated to determine if
the charge is legitimate.
2. Soon after the phone call, you will receive a letter in
the mail summarizing the details about the charge
and letting you know that the card company is look-
ing into the charge and will let you know of the 
disposition.
When the card company completes its investigation,
and you receive notification that the charge was fraud-
ulent, pay close attention to your credit card bills
because someone may have your card number.
3. Follow up your initial phone call with a dispute
letter (see Figure 4-2).
Keep in mind the following points:
• The dispute letter is to be sent within 60 days of
when the disputed charge appeared on your bill.
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
60

• Send the letter by certified mail return receipt
requested to make sure the credit card company
received the letter.
• Don’t send the letter to the address where you send
your monthly payment; send it the address for billing
inquiries. The address for billing inquiries is found
on the back of your monthly bill.
• Enclose a copy of your monthly bill and circle the
charge(s) you are disputing. Don’t send the original
monthly bill — keep it in your files, along with a
copy of the dispute letter and the return receipt
from the post office after the letter is delivered.
Figure 4-2: Sample dispute letter from the Federal 
Trade Commission.
4. Mark your calendar.
The credit card company must acknowledge your dis-
pute within 30 days after receiving it. The credit card
company must resolve the dispute within two months
of receiving your letter but not more than 90 days after
receiving your dispute letter.
5. Call the credit card company to obtain your current
balance every week until your next bill arrives in 
the mail.
Chapter 4: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing When You Are a Victim 61

If there are any charges you didn’t authorize, speak to
a representative and let him or her know. You may want
to cancel the card, as well, and ask for a new account
number.
6. Check your credit report to make sure there are no
other surprises.
Closely monitor your bank statements and your
investment accounts. You need to stay on top of the
situation so it does not escalate into a bigger mess.
Suddenly . . . several unknown
charges on each month’s bill
You can handle several unknown charges that appear on your
bill each month the same way you address a large unknown
purchase, although you may not need to cancel your card.
I have experienced this issue myself. I called the card company
and told them which charge I was disputing because I didn’t
make or authorize it. They removed the charges, and when the
charges appeared on the next month’s bill, as well, the matter
was turned over to the credit card’s fraud department.
I spoke to the investigator, and he said they knew about the
company making the charges and that they would take care of
it. The next month’s bill did not have the charges on the bill.
In my case, it was not an identity theft; it was credit card fraud.
The charges, which were small ($50.00 to $65.00 per month),
would have continued if I paid them and did not dispute them.
It pays to review your credit card bill closely every month and
not just blindly pay it.
This was the second time I had issues with a credit card.
Several years ago, I noticed charges appearing on my monthly
bill that I didn’t recognize. I called the card company and spoke
to a representative to question the charges. The charges were
removed from the current month’s bill. The next month, sev-
eral new charges appeared on my bill. The charges from the
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
62

previous month were found to be fraudulent. When I called
the card company, they suggested that I cancel the card. They
issued a new one and moved my current legitimate charges to
the new account. (This is where keeping your receipts for a
month comes in handy.) 
I received a new card several days after the phone conversation
with the credit card company representative. I also put an alert
on the card so that I would be contacted by the card company
if any charges occurred that seemed to be out of my ordinary
pattern of spending. The situation was resolved, and I didn’t
receive any unauthorized or fraudulent charges on that partic-
ular credit card after the card was cancelled and a new account
was opened.
The charges on my monthly credit card bill were not large, so
they could have gone unnoticed had I not made a habit of
checking my monthly bill closely. The fraudulent charges each
month totaled no more than $60.00, and they were usually in
$30.00 amounts for each charge. The thieves limit the charge
amounts in hopes that they won’t draw attention to them-
selves, and they bank on the chance that I pay my monthly
bills without closely reviewing them.

including the most popular, the 401K. I present some reasons
why you should look at your bank account statements regu-
larly and some signs that may suggest you are the victim of
identity theft.
Checking Your Bank Statement
Religiously
When you review your bank statements regularly (monthly)
you will know around the time your statements will be deliv-
ered. If your bank statements don’t show up regularly, you

Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
66
may be a victim of mail theft. If your statements don’t show
up, you need to follow these steps immediately:
1. Call the bank to see if they sent the statement, or if
there is a delay. 
2. If the statement was sent, check to see if you are
missing other mail, such as credit card statements.
3. Contact the post office and have them check to see 
if there is a change of address form on file for your
address.
If there is a change of address form on file that you did
not make, inform the post office of the fraud.
4. Contact the Postal Inspection Service and report a
mail theft problem.
5. Contact your local police or sheriff’s department as
well to report the mail theft.
6. Contact the bank and tell them about your mail
problem and close and open new bank accounts.
Transfer your money to the new accounts. Ask for
new ATM cards and change your PIN.
You must review your bank statements every month if you are
to detect theft issues quickly — before they escalate.
Credit card statements are also an issue if not received regu-
larly. Your credit card statement has all the information an
identity thief needs to use the card himself (see Chapter 3 for
more information). With your credit card information in hand,
an identity thief can take an expensive trip on your nickel. He
or she probably will not send a post card telling you what a
wonderful time he or she is having. In fact, the thief is proba-
bly pretty darned glad you are not there with them.
If you don’t receive your monthly statement from your credit
card company, it is not because they are so grateful that you
pay your bill every month on time and are giving you a break;
it is more likely that you are the victim of mail theft. Follow the
steps outlined previously in this section if you don’t receive
your credit card statement for even one month.

Identifying an Unwelcome
Doppelganger
Any unknown activity on your bank statements is a red flag. If
you identify a red flag, a strong possibility exists that you have
a joint account with a thief. When you review your accounts,
look for the following:
 For checking account statements, make sure that all the
checks listed in your statement are also listed in your
check register.
 Look for any checks that are made out to “Cash” and ask
yourself whether you wrote the checks.
 Look for ATM withdrawals you didn’t make from savings
and checking accounts.
 Review instances when you are overdrawn in your check-
ing account.
 Note all the withdrawals, especially those that are ATM
or online payments from the account. Any you don’t rec-
ognize should be questioned.
 Balance your checkbook every month so that you know
how much is in the account. This will also help you get
into the routine of checking the bank statements so that
you know when they should appear in your mailbox.
 For savings account statements, make sure that any with-
drawals that are listed were made by you.
Reviewing your bank statements regularly is a good way to
reconcile your accounts and make sure that your balances 
are accurate, but you have to do it every month. This way,
you can fix issues quickly — before they escalate.
Withdrawals you didn’t make
The Activity Summary, and the Withdrawals and Other 
Withdrawals sections of your bank statements are important;
Chapter 5: Homing In on Financial Statements 67

you need to pay attention to them. If you see withdrawals 
that you did not make, you must note the discrepancy as a
red flag. Definitely call the bank and talk to them about the
charge.
Checks you did not write
As you are reviewing your checking account statement, look
for checks written for things that you don’t recognize. If the
numbers of any of the checks on the statement are out of
sequence, make note of it. This is a red flag that something
could be wrong.
The other scenario is that you see check numbers for checks
you don’t recognize. You look at the cancelled checks that
come with your statement and then you look at your register,
and you confirm your suspicions: You didn’t write the checks
for cash in the amount shown on your statement.
Don’t panic; call your bank and tell them you didn’t write the
checks in question. The dollar amount written on the checks,
and the check pay to the order of in your register shows the
checks you made out were to three entirely different entities,
such as your electric utility bill, your phone bill, and your
credit card payment.
Here is what you should do if you suspect your checks have
been lost or stolen.
 In most states, the bank is liable for forged checks, but
you must notify your bank in a timely manner. Timely
manner is rather ambiguous, so my recommendation is
that you check your statement every month and contact
your bank as soon as you notice something.
 You may want to close the account and open a new 
one. The bank will want to know of any outstanding
checks you have written so they can be paid when 
they arrive.
 Contact your local police department and report the lost
or stolen checks.
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
68

 Also, contact the check verification companies listed in
Chapter 3 and let them know that your checks have been
lost or stolen.
Figure 5-1 shows the TeleCheck Web site, and it explains the
services they provide if you lose checks or have them stolen.
It gives the phone number for merchants and consumers to
report lost or stolen checks, (800) 366-2425.
Finding bizarre bank 
account balances
Suppose that when you review your bank account statements,
you notice that the balances are not what they should be
according to your records. You review your statements by
checking all your deposits with all the deposit slips you have
been keeping for the month against those recorded on your
statement. If they don’t match, call your bank immediately
and tell them about the discrepancy.
Figure 5-1: The TeleCheck Web site explains lost or stolen checks.
Chapter 5: Homing In on Financial Statements 69

The Activity Detail Deposits and Interest section of your bank
statement shows the date of each deposit. A description and
the amount for each deposit is listed. If your paycheck is a
direct deposit, each pay period is listed here along with any
other deposits you made during the month.
Keeping all your deposit slips and your paycheck stubs for the
month pays off when you find a discrepancy in your account
balance.
After you check the deposits, look at the withdrawals, espe-
cially those made with your ATM and debit card. Are they 
correct? The account statements make it easy to find the
information. If you did not make any one or more of the with-
drawals, call your bank and tell them about the discrepancy.
Reviewing Investment 
Account Statements
You should also check your investment account statements,
such as your 401K and IRA statements. These accounts are
not immune from being compromised. The statements are
usually quarterly, so you don’t get to review them as often 
as other accounts unless you view them online. Most of the
401K accounts have this option, as do the other investment
accounts.
Check the account statements closely to make sure no one is
helping themselves to your money. Look at the balances in the
accounts and compare them from the previous statements’
balances. There will be fluctuations due to the stock market
conditions, but watch for withdrawals you didn’t make, or
changes that don’t seem right. Figures 5-2 shows a sample
401K quarterly statement from Bank401K.com.
My advice is for you to review all your accounts regularly. 
By regularly I mean at least monthly, and if the statement is
only sent quarterly you can still access it via the Internet to
review it.

important tool in preventing identity theft.
What Is a Credit Report?
A credit report is a factual record of your credit payment 
history. Based on your credit history, a credit rating, or 
credit score, can assess your credit risk from high to low.
Figure 6-1 shows a credit report from one of the major credit
bureaus.

Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
74
Figure 6-1: Equifax credit report.
The report is broken into the following sections.
 The personal profile section includes your legal name,
Also Known As (AKA), addresses (current and previous),
year of birth, and employers (current and previous).
 Credit summary is the total number of accounts that you
have opened and closed in each category. Installment
accounts are car loans, furniture on payments, stereo
equipment, and mortgage loans; revolving accounts are
credit cards, lines of credit, and so on.
 Public records are court records relating to bankrupt-
cies, tax liens, monetary judgments, and overdue child
support payments. These records stay on the report for
7–10 years.
 Credit inquiries are either hard or soft. You initiate hard
inquiries when “you” apply for credit. Soft inquiries are
made by “perspective employers” when they do a back-
ground check and by credit card companies for pre-
approved credit cards.
 The account history contains the details of each account
you have opened or closed.

 Your credit score is based on the information in your
report relating to your payment history and the number
of credit accounts you have open, as well as the balances
on the accounts, which is known as debt to income ratio.
Debt to income ratio is simply the amount of money you
make and the amount you owe. If the ratio of debt is too
high as it relates to your income, you will be denied the
loan in most cases because your ability to pay dimin-
ishes with each account you open. In other words, you
run out of money before all the accounts can be paid
each month.
Obtaining Your Credit Report
To obtain your credit report, simply visit one of the credit
bureau Web sites and complete the order form. After your
identity is verified, you can view the report online via these
secure Web sites and print it. In addition, you can order a
printed report over the telephone or by regular mail, which
takes about 10 days to reach you.
Here is the contact information for the “big three” credit
reporting agencies:
 Experian: www.experian.com; (888) 397-3742
 Equifax: www.equifax.com; (800) 685-1111
 TransUnion: www.tuc.com; (800) 916-8800
With any of these three agencies, you can dispute something
on your credit report online or by phone. You just need a cur-
rent copy of your credit report (no more than 90 days old)
from the agency you’re contacting to dispute an item on the
report. All three offer free fraud prevention services, including
fraud alert statements that you can place on your credit file if
you have been the victim of fraud. Credit monitoring services
are also available for a fee.
According to the new Fair Credit Reporting Act, you are enti-
tled to one free report per year from each credit bureau. So
take advantage of something free and order your credit report
annually.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 75

The Act was signed into law in December 2003, but it does not
go into effect until December 2004. There is a phased regional
rollout plan that starts on the West coast and adds another
region every quarter. The schedule for implementation is as
follows:
 Western states: December 1, 2004
 Twelve Midwest states: March 1, 2005
 Eleven southern states: June 1, 2005
 All remaining states: September 1, 2005
All three credit bureaus offer an annual subscription service.

Reviewing the Telltale
Information on Your 
Credit Report
In this section, I explain the red flags you may find when you
review your credit report and how to address them. Your three-
in-one report is a good place to start looking.
The three-in-one credit report is one report that has all three
credit reports combined into one report for side-by-side com-
parison. The cost for the report is $34.95 from Experian, $39.95
from Equifax, and $39.95 from TransUnion.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 79

The personal profile section
Figure 6-3 shows the personal profile section of a three-in-one
report. The report lists all the information each of the three
credit bureaus has about you in your personal profile. The
report even provides a side-by-side listing of the information
for easy comparison.
The personal profile section of your single credit bureau
report in Figure 6-3 includes the following information:
 Your legal name
 Also Known As (AKA) other names associated with your
credit files
 Year of birth 
 Current and previous addresses
 Current and previous employers
Figure 6-3: The personal profile section of a three-in-one credit report.
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
80

To correct any errors relating to your personal profile, you must
prove your identity by supplying the following information:
 Full legal name including SR, JR, III, and so on
 Current and previous addresses for the last five years
 Date of birth
 Two methods to prove your address, such as:
• Copy of your driver’s license
• Utility bill
• Bank statement
• Insurance statement
Any changes to your addresses that you didn’t make are an
issue and could be an indicator of fraud. Send a letter to the
credit bureau to have the information corrected immediately
via Certified Mail return receipt. The mail receipt is your record
of sending the letter, and the return receipt tells you that your
letter was received by the credit bureau.
Reviewing your credit report to see if all the information is
correct in each of your three reports will help you clear any
inaccuracies before they become an issue. When you see dis-
crepancies, you should note them, and bring them to the
attention of the credit bureau by filing a “dispute” with the
bureau that has posted the information you are challenging.
The account history section
The sample shown in Figure 6-4 lists all open and closed
accounts. It is important to make sure that all the information
is accurate. Note that in the sample shown in Figure 6-4, Equifax
does not have any information about the Banana Republic
account. The other two credit bureaus list the information —
it was reported to them. Lenders are not required to report 
to all three bureaus, so loans are sometimes reported only to
one bureau. This is why it is important to get your three-in-one
report. This way, you can see if there any accounts that have
been opened without your knowledge.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 81

Figure 6-4: The account history section on a three-in-one credit report.
The credit summary section
Figure 6-5 shows the credit summary section of a credit report.
This section of the report is important. It lists all the loans that
are currently open, the amount and type of loan, the balance,
the name of the company, and whether any are delinquencies.
Any accounts you didn’t open are an issue and may be an
indictor of fraud. Also, any loans in collection that you don’t
recognize as yours are an issue. File a dispute report immedi-
ately in either of these instances.
The public records section
The public records section sample in Figure 6-6 is a list of
court actions for bankruptcy, tax liens, monetary judgments,
and overdue child support payments in some states. The list
comes from federal, state, and county court records
If you find any monetary judgment in a state you haven’t lived
in, file a dispute immediately. Also, find out more from the
court record. The court name and case number are listed

on the report, and you can use them to obtain a copy of the
record for your review.

Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 83

The credit inquiries section
Figure 6-7 shows the credit inquiries section of a credit report.
There are two types of inquiries — hard and soft.
 Hard inquiries affect your credit score, and potential
creditors see them when reviewing your report. You 
initiate these inquiries when you complete a credit 
application.
If you didn’t initiate an inquiry that appears on your
report by applying for a loan or credit card, it is an issue!
File a dispute immediately.
 Soft inquiries are those inquiries that only you see and
they do not affect your credit score. These inquiries are
pre-employment screening, or pre-approved credit card
offers and mortgage loan applications, to name a few.
You can minimize the pre-approved card offer inquiries
by opting-out. See Chapter 3 for details.
Figure 6-7: The credit inquiries section of a three-in-one credit report.
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
84

The account history section
Figure 6-8 shows the account history section of a credit report.
The information includes the account type, balance, account
status, the date the account was opened, and the payment
status. The payment status is where you find whether the
account payments are on schedule as agreed when the account
was opened. Look at the account numbers — for security rea-
sons, only the last four digits are printed. Your report will look
the same as the sample.
Your credit score
Your credit score is important to your credit rating and is an
indication of what kind of credit risk you are and what interest
rate you will be charged for a loan. Your credit score can also
be an indicator that someone has stolen your identity (for
example, when your score has a sudden unknown change).
Figure 6-8: The account history section of a three-in-one credit report.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 85

The score is calculated based on the information in your report
for that particular bureau. One popular score is known as the
FICO® score because it is calculated on software developed by
the Fair Isaac Company. However, all three credit reporting
agencies have developed their own consumer credit scores.
Literally, there are thousands of credit scores used, some devel-
oped for industry-specific types of credit, such as auto loans
or mortgage loans. The score is on the scale where the higher
the score, the better credit risk you are. If your score is 768, 
as shown in Figure 6-9, for example, you are in the excellent
range. Your score is 81% higher than most U.S. consumers.
Figure 6-9: Sample credit score from Experian.
Table 6-2 lists the score names by credit bureau. I give you 
the information about credit scores so you know what each
bureau calls their credit scores, but these are only the scores
derived from the FICO. The higher your score, the better the
credit risk you are.

Sudden unknown credit 
score change
A sudden unknown change in your credit score is a red flag. For
example, you may apply for a loan and be turned down because
your credit score is too low. You review your credit report to
determine why your score has suddenly dropped. You discover
that your report has credit accounts you did not open and
several are more than 30 days delinquent. Let the lender know
that some of the information on your credit report is inaccu-
rate, and you are going to file a dispute to resolve the issue.
You must dispute the inaccurate information with the credit
agency from which the lender received your credit report. You
will need the report number. When you go online to dispute
the information, follow the links to dispute online. (All three
agencies have the link on their Web sites, usually under the
heading personal solutions or services.) When you click on
Personal Solutions, one of the subheadings that appears on
the personal solutions page is Dispute Online. Click on the
heading, and it will take you to the dispute form with direc-
tions on how to complete the form.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 87

A sudden change, usually a drop in your credit score, is most
likely caused by having too many accounts with several that
are delinquent for more than 30 days. Dispute inaccurate infor-
mation immediately so that you can get the issue resolved
before it escalates even further.
A fraud alert tells the credit bureaus that you have been the
victim of identity theft. You report the alert to one bureau and
per the FACTAct, it then reports it to the other two bureaus.
You use a dispute to question any wrong information on a par-
ticular bureau’s credit report. To dispute information, you must
first have a current report from the bureau with whom you are
disputing the information.
To place a fraud alert on your report, do the following. For
more detail, see Chapter 3.
 Contact your local police and file an identity theft report.
 Place a fraud alert on your credit report.
 Check your other accounts to see if any of them have
been tampered with as well.
 Close any accounts that have been tampered with.
 Choose a new PIN and get a new ATM card.
Looking for consistency
When you review your report, look for consistency in the
information outlined in Table 6-4.

Disputing Your Credit Report
You have found information that you want to challenge. How
do you do it? Well, the three credit bureaus have online dis-
pute forms. Figure 6-10 shows a sample of Experian’s online
dispute form.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Credit Report 89

Figure 6-10: Sample online dispute form from Experian.
Figure 6-11 explains disputes and has a hyperlink to the online
dispute form. Notice that on the dispute form there is a space
for you to include your credit report number, and you must
include your Social Security number.
When you file a dispute, you need to include a credit report
number from a personally ordered report that is no more than
90 days old.
At the bottom of the dispute form is a notice to let you know
that it is a crime to obtain a credit report for anyone else; you
may dispute information only on your own report. Figure 6-11
shows the terms and conditions.
Figure 6-11: Experian terms and conditions for disputing your credit report.
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
90

You can also view the status of your dispute online. The form
is essentially the same as the one shown in Figure 6-11, but 
at the top, instead of saying request a dispute, it says Check
the Status of Your Dispute. The credit bureaus have 30 days to
respond to your dispute.
Finally, there is a form to check the results of your dispute. The
form is essentially the same one used for checking the status
of your dispute with two notable differences. The first is the
heading of the form says View the Results of Your Dispute, 
and a box is added just to the right of the box for stating 
an investigation ID number. The credit bureau gives you the
investigation ID number when you check the status of your
dispute.

in public, watching what you say and do can go a long
way in protecting your identity. What sort of a sport is
“dumpster diving” and how can you prevent it from ruining
your day? Surﬁng the web is fun but you must protect your
identity while online, especially when you are making pur-
chases. Finally, you see how to safely order merchandise
on the phone.

T
he important personal information you discard can come
back to haunt you in a big way if you don’t destroy it before
tossing it. Before you throw away any document with your
name on it, think about what the consequences would be if 
it fell into the wrong hands. This chapter outlines the issues
you may face if you don’t destroy various types of documents
before discarding them, including credit card statements, bank
account statements, utility and cell phone bills, cancelled
checks, and old driver’s licenses.
Protecting Your Mail
Your mailbox and garbage can contain a bonanza of informa-
tion for the identity thief. You need to pay attention to what 
is in your mailbox and what you throw away. By following the
simple tips in Table 7-1, you can help protect your mail from
falling into the wrong hands.

Watching What You Throw Away
Your garbage cans hold a treasure trove of personal informa-
tion. You throw away valuable personal information every day,
and if you are like most of us, you probably don’t even give it a
second thought. Before reading this book, you probably didn’t
even own or plan to buy a shredder.
“Dumpster diving” is not an Olympic sport, but you wouldn’t
know that by the enthusiasm its participants have for scav-
enging for personal information in your garbage. The thieves
are looking for pre-approved credit card applications and the
part of your credit card statement that you discarded without
shredding or tearing. There they are: your bank statements
with account numbers and balances, mixed in with last night’s
spaghetti. Wow, look over there, your cancelled checks you
tossed because you don’t need them for tax receipts. You get
the idea. You must destroy the documents that contain your
personal information before discarding them.
If you don’t shred, it isn’t dead. Don’t leave any morsels for
the identity thief to help him or her in their quest to steal
your identity and live to their fullest at your expense.
Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb 97
Mailbox Flags
The mailbox flag was a familiar sight
when I was growing up. It meant that
there was mail in the curbside box to
be picked up. The flag was raised to
let the mail carrier and everyone else
know that there was outgoing mail in
the box. It worked well — so well, in
fact, that identity thieves also know
that there is mail in the box for the
taking. So placing anything at the curb-
side mailbox to be picked up, espe-
cially those bills with personal checks
and credit card statements enclosed,
is not a good idea. On the other hand,
leaving delivered mail in the box for
an extended period of time is not a
good idea either. How long should
delivered mail be left in the curbside
box? For as short a time as possible.
In other words, you should retrieve
your mail as soon as you can. You
don’t want to give the identity thief
any more opportunity than necessary
to steal your mail; when you are not
home, have a trusted neighbor remove
the mail from the box.

Expired credit cards should be destroyed before you discard
them. Throwing away expired credit cards without destroying
them will only come back to haunt you later. The identity thief
only needs your name, card number, and expiration date to
order stuff online or on the phone. The three-digit security
code is on the back of the card, and the identity thief will have
this as well.
You also need to destroy your expired debit card to prevent
the identity thief from getting your card number and name.
Monthly credit card statements
When an identity thief enters a dumpster or for that 
matter garbage cans in front of your house, he or she has a
competitor — the neighborhood cat. In the mix of the food
stuff and other things is your credit card statement, perhaps 
a little stained with coffee grounds or tomato sauce, but still
legible. The only problem is that the thief needs to wrestle the
paper away from the cat that is crouched on it (and probably
feasting on a half-eaten tuna fish sandwich). The fight is worth
it to the identity thief, though, because the gain outweighs the
unpleasant experience.
You may be thinking, why would anyone choose to go through
someone’s stinky, dirty, garbage? It’s the payoff that keeps them
coming back for more. For the identity thief, finding the per-
sonal information you discard that is legible enough to use to
their advantage is the reason. Your credit card statements have
just the kind of information the identity thief is seeking. The
thief will use the information from the statement himself, or
he or she will sell it to someone else.
For an identity thief, finding your monthly credit card state-
ment is like striking gold. Your credit card information can be
used to buy anything he or she desires, and the best thing for
them is they know they don’t have to pay for it. In most states,
you are responsible for zero of the unauthorized charges on
your credit card if you report the fraudulent charges immedi-
ately upon receiving your monthly statement. However, you
still need to review all the charges on the statement and dis-
pute those you didn’t authorize. To dispute the unauthorized
charges you will need to contact the credit card company, 
and tell them which charges you are disputing on your bill, 
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
98

as described in Chapter 11. It is better to prevent the theft in
the first place by shredding your paid credit card statements
before throwing them away.
You should shred your pre-approved credit offers and credit
card statements before you discard them. Here are some addi-
tional tips to help protect your credit from theft:
 When you pay your credit card bill, don’t write your full
credit card account number on the memo or for line on
the check; write only the last four digits. The credit card
company knows the rest of the numbers. This will help
protect your account number from prying eyes since a
number of people will be handling the check in the credit
card company as well as your bank.
 Destroy the cancelled check before discarding it. If you
discard the check without destroying it, you may inadver-
tently distribute your credit card account number or, at
minimum, your checking account number and signature.
For more information about discarding cancelled checks,
see the section, “Cancelled checks,” later in this chapter.
Monthly checking account 
statements
The identity thief is after all sorts of treasures in your trash.
For example, your monthly checking account statement. Just
think of the information that is on that statement — your name,
address, account number, bank name and address, and your
balance.
The account information can be used to make counterfeit
checks to drain your account. Using the information from your
discarded statement, the identity thief can open a new check-
ing account in your name and write bad checks on the account.
The checks are bad because the identity thief puts only enough
money in the account to open it, so when checks for purchases
are written on the account, non-sufficient funds (NSF) exist to
cover the checks. Because your name is on the account, you
are the one who appears to be writing the bad checks. You find
out about the problem when you write a check at the grocery
store, and they tell you they can’t accept your check.
Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb 99

Stores use check-guarantee companies to get reports on checks
that the bank sends back stamped NSF, known as returned
checks. By helping merchants identify customers who are
passing bad checks, the check-guarantee companies help 
the merchants minimize their losses. 
The check-guarantee companies also protect the customer. For
example, when you notify them that checks have been lost or
stolen, they alert retailers for you. In addition, you can request
a consumer report from an agency such as SCAN. SCAN stands
for Shared Check Authorization Network. SCAN is not a credit
bureau; it is a consumer-reporting agency that is governed 
by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. You can dispute inaccurate
information on your SCAN report just as you can credit bureau
information. Chapter 11 provides a list of other check verifica-
tion services with contact information.
Utility bills
Among the papers and various stuff you find in the trash are
the “detach for your records” parts of your utility bills. This
part of the bill has your name, address, and account number
on it. Utility bills — telephone, water, garbage, and electric —
are used as proof of address to open accounts at the local
bank in your name. The identity thief can put them to good
use if you don’t shred them before you discard them. Don’t
give identity thieves the chance to use your discarded utility
bills for their gain and your pain. Shred or tear up the part
you are going to throw away.
Cell phone bills
Cell phone bills have the appearance of not being something
you need to think about when you are taking precautionary
measures to prevent you from becoming a victim of identity
theft, but consider the following: Cell phone bills have your
name, address, account number, and cell phone number all
right there on the bill stub that you are given to keep for your
records (and, if you’re like most of us, you promptly discard).
An identity thief can use your bill stub as proof of address to
open a bank account in your name. To protect yourself, shred
or tear up your cell phone bill before you discard it.
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
100

Cancelled checks
Most folks simply throw cancelled checks (ones they don’t
need for tax purposes) in the trash. Most of the time, people
discard checks without tearing or shredding them. The checks
contain important information, however, such as your name,
address, account number, and the name and address of 
your bank.
To the identity thief, it’s the information contained on the
checks that’s important — not the actual checks. The identity
thief can use your account information to make counterfeit
checks to either clean out your account or to write bad checks
in your name. The thief can also order stuff online by using
your checking account information like a debit card, except
that the money for the item purchased comes directly out of
your checking account.
If you are not going to keep all your cancelled checks, destroy
them before you throw them away. Another option is to have
your bank hold your cancelled checks for safekeeping and not
send them to you with your monthly statement. You must pay
a fee to have your bank hold your checks, and the fee varies
from bank to bank. To find out if your bank offers the check
safekeeping service, call the phone number listed on your
checking account statement.
Expired driver’s licenses
Before you toss your old driver’s license in the trash, you
should destroy it. I don’t mean you should cut it half; you
should totally destroy it like you would your old credit card.
Your driver’s license number can be used to make a counterfeit
license with your name and address. To prevent counterfeit-
ing, most states issue driver’s licenses that have holograms or
offset photos of the licensee on them. To see the hologram,
however, you need to remove the license from the wallet pic-
ture window. Most businesses do not ask a person writing a
check to remove the license; they just quickly jot down the
license number on the check. If a license is not checked closely,
an identity thief can get away with cashing counterfeit checks
using the counterfeit license.
Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb 101

Some shredders are strong enough to shred a driver’s license
or credit card, thus keeping them from falling into the waiting
hands of the identity thief. If you don’t have a shredder, cut the
old drivers’ license into small pieces so that it is not worth the
effort to put it together to read your date of birth and driver’s
license number.

to avoid “shoulder surfing” thieves.
Carrying Minimal Personal
Information
This is an easy secret: The less personal information you carry,
the less personal information an identity thief can steal from
you. The following sections discuss some simple measures you
can take to prevent your important information from being
stolen.

Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
104
Do not carry your Social 
Security Card
Don’t under any circumstances ever carry your Social Security
Card in your wallet or purse. Lose your wallet or purse — or
worse, have it stolen — and you lose your Social Security Card.
Your SSN is an important identifier in our society; the number
can be sold or used by anyone once they have your card.
The only time you need to carry your Social Security Card 
is when you start a new job (so that the Human Resources
department can photocopy it). After you return home from
your first day at a new job, take your Social Security Card out
of your wallet or purse and place it in the fireproof safe where
you keep your other important documents for safekeeping.
Be stingy with your SSN. Nobody but the government has a
lawful reason to request your SSN. You don’t have to give your
SSN to any business that asks for it, except when completing a
credit application, or for verification purposes your first day
on a new job.
If you suspect or know that someone is using your SSN to 
get a job, contact the Social Security Administration at www.
ssa.gov. On the other hand, if someone is using your SSN to
get credit the Social Security Administration can’t fix your
credit, and they suggest that you follow the steps I outline in
Chapter 3. 
You can see whether someone is using your SSN to get a job
by checking your Social Security statement. You can order 
a statement online or contact the nearest Social Security
Administration Office and request one. In addition to any
statement you request, a statement is sent to you annually.
Memorize your SSN, and you won’t have a need to carry your
Social Security Card. Problem solved!
Memorize your bank ATM PIN
Choose an ATM PIN that you can easily remember. This way,
you don’t need to write it down. Writing down your PIN defeats

the purpose of having a PIN. Writing down your PIN and carry-
ing it in your wallet or purse with your ATM card is an espe-
cially bad idea. If your wallet or purse is stolen or lost, you lose
your PIN and possibly your money as well.
When you choose a PIN, don’t use your birthday, your chil-
dren’s or spouses’ birthday, your SSN, your address, and so
on. These numbers are too easy to guess. Try instead the last
four digits of a friend’s phone number (not your own!), or a
special date that isn’t your birthday.
Protect yourself. Don’t make it easy for would-be thieves to
steal your hard-earned money. Memorize your PIN so that if
you lose your ATM card, you can rest easy knowing the card 
is useless to any one else.
Carry one credit card
Look in your wallet or purse. How many credit cards are in
there? You probably have several cards in your wallet, and
even some you forgot you were carrying and haven’t used in 
a long time. So right now, stop reading and take out all the
extra credit cards in your wallet. You will be glad you did.
Carrying more than one credit card only compounds your
problems when your wallet or purse is stolen or lost, so just
don’t do it. Take retail store credit cards, for example. The
only time you need to carry a retail store credit card is 
when you are going to that store. In fact, most retail stores
now accept the major credit cards, so how many different
cards do you really need? The fewer cards you have, the 
less you have to worry about if your wallet or purse is stolen
or lost.
You are striving to become a hard target, which means that
you are practicing prevention. If you carry less personal 
information, you will be a harder target. If someone does get
your wallet or purse, they will not have as much personal
information about you as they do about the other person 
who was nice enough to carry all of his or her credit cards 
at one time.
Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places 105

Carry personal checks 
only when necessary
Carrying your personal checks everywhere you go isn’t the
best idea. I realize that there are times when you need to pur-
chase something on the spur of the moment and having your
checks with you comes in real handy. But losing your blank
checks can be a drain on your checking account balance if
someone finds and uses the checks to help themselves to
your money. Consider some alternatives, like using cash, or
using the one major credit card that you carry in your wallet
or purse.
If you do lose your blank checks, contact the bank immedi-
ately and have them freeze your account to cover outstanding
checks written on the account. You may need to open a new
account.
After you write a check, make sure that you only tear out the
one you just wrote and not the next one along with it, which 
is blank. Giving a blank check to someone could be a problem
for you depending upon the honesty of the person to whom
you unknowingly hand the blank check. 
Minimize your exposure by carrying your personal checks
only when you know you will need them. The less often you
carry your personal checks around, the less chance you have
of losing them or having them stolen.
Here are some other tips for keeping your checks secure:
 Do not put your driver’s license number or SSN on your
checks.
 Make sure that you can account for all your checks —
used, unused, and void.
 When you pay by check, you should be aware of your sur-
roundings as you write out and sign the check. If someone
looks over your shoulder, they can easily memorize your
name and address and the name of the bank where you
have your account.
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
106

 Be careful with the check registers that are a carbon of
the check you just wrote. If you lose the register, the
information in the carbon can be a problem. The carbon
in the register has the check number, account number
(for most banks), name of the bank, and your signature
(often blocked out by a black box). Keep these check 
registers in an especially safe location when shopping.
 When you void checks, destroy them before you discard
them, and do not forget to record in your register that
check number XYZ has been voided and the date you
voided it.
The Walls Have Ears and Eyes
Identity thieves have no dignity. They will stop at nothing to
get your personal information, even if it means looking over
your shoulder while you’re at the register or eavesdropping
on your wireless phone conversations at the mall. Don’t let
these bandits get the best of you. The following sections show
you how to defend yourself against these crimes.
Shoulder surfing
Shoulder surfing is not the latest water sport craze to hit the
beaches of Southern California, and it has nothing to do with
the real sport of surfing. Shoulder surfing is a term used to
describe the art of looking over the shoulder of another
person to see what they are doing.
Shoulder surfing got its start in airports, bus stations, and train
stations. Thieves would record the phone credit card numbers
of those unsuspecting victims who were using a public phone
to make telephone calls. How it works is that the person may
be standing alongside you, pretending to use the adjacent pay
telephone, but what he or she is actually doing is watching you
punch in your phone credit card number and PIN. The person
doing the shoulder surfing does not have to be directly behind
you or even next to you; they can be in direct line of sight look-
ing through a camera with a zoom lens to record the punching
in of the numbers. They write down the number and then sell
it to others for their use.
Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places 107

These days, shoulder surfing is used to capture your PIN
when you use your ATM and key in your PIN. With the advent
of camera cell phones, it is easier than ever to fetch your
account and PIN.
So what can you do? First, protect your keystrokes from 
plain view when you key in your PIN. You never know who 
is watching even a short distance away, so block their view
with your body.
Also beware of this sophisticated trick: Some thieves will actu-
ally place a camera close to the keypad, usually in the deposit
envelope holder. The camera sits in the bottom of the holder
and is aimed at the keypad to capture your keystrokes. In addi-
tion, they modify the place where you insert your ATM card.
They place a portable reader in the slot, which reads your card
number and then displays a message stating that the ATM is
not working.
When you use an ATM, check whether the slot looks like some-
one tampered with it. You can usually see cracking or some
other telltale mark, or your card will not go into the slot easily.
If you see anything like this, don’t use the ATM.
Be careful about what you say
Cell phones are in widespread use today. You can hear people
talking on their phones everywhere. I don’t know what the deal
is, but people think you need to talk loudly into cell phones,
and consequently, you can plainly and clearly hear one side 
of the conversation.
Now, if the person using the cell is ordering something using
the cell phone, you are able to hear them give his or her credit
card type, number, expiration date, and name. All that a thief
needs to do is write down the information and voilà, he or she
has a credit card to use to order stuff on the phone. You also
sometimes hear someone giving his or her SSN over the cell
phone in a public place. This is not a good idea at all.
Conversations between you and someone who is with you in 
a public place can also be overheard, so be careful what you
discuss about your personal information. Discussing personal
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
108

information in public places is just not a good idea if you want
to be a hard target.
Think of your personal information as sensitive information
that if discovered, may help someone to assume your identity.
The walls have ears — you never know who is listening and
trying to pick up personal information to use to his or her
advantage. There was a saying during World War II, Loose Lips
Sink Ships. The phrase makes perfect sense in the prevention
of identity theft.
Keeping Track of 
Important Things
If you’ve ever lost your wallet or have had a credit card number
stolen, you know what I’m talking about here: Big trouble, big
pain in the neck. The sections that follow provide some tips
for managing those pesky receipts and preventing them from
falling into the wrong hands. You also get the rundown on what
to do if your wallet goes missing.
Checking Credit Card Receipts
Look at the credit card receipt you just signed. Does it have
your full credit card number, name, and expiration date printed
on it? The law is changing, and only the last digits will be
printed on all copies of the credit card receipt in the near
future (see Chapter 3 for more information). But for now,
those receipts contain all the information an identity thief
needs to wreak havoc with your credit.
Here are some ways to safeguard your information:
 Don’t leave your copy of the credit card receipt behind at
the register. There is too much information on it.
 Don’t throw away your receipt in a trashcan near the
area where you just used your credit card. Keep all your
receipts so that you can reconcile your monthly bill, and
then shred them before you throw them away.
Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places 109

 Don’t leave the receipt you signed on the table in a restau-
rant. Make sure that your server picks it up before you go.
 Beware of “skimming.” This activity occurs mostly at
restaurants. The waiter or waitress has a small handheld
device that he or she swipes your card through. The
device captures the data off of the magnetic strip on the
card. The data contains enough information that can be
transferred to another magnetic stripe of a counterfeit
card, which can be used fraudulently. If possible, make
sure that your waiter or waitress does not perform this
activity with your card.
 When you review your receipt, make sure that no one
around you can read it along with you, especially if the
receipt has your full credit card number and expiration
date printed on it.
Losing your wallet or purse
Losing your wallet or purse is a pain in the neck. If you lose it,
you have some work to do. You should do the following:
 Take an assessment and think of what was in your wallet
or purse.
 Take out all your credit card contact numbers you have
stored in a safe place (see Chapter 2 for more details) and
begin calling them. Tell your creditors that you had your
wallet stolen or lost your driver’s license.
 Contact the DMV in your state, and let them know you
lost your driver’s license.
 Contact your bank and tell them to cancel your ATM card
and issue a new one.
 If you were carrying checks, contact the bank and freeze
your account.
If you lose your wallet or purse, you need to take action 
immediately — don’t delay. As soon as you realize your wallet
or purse is gone, get to work. Follow the actions outlined in
the preceding list. The sooner you do, the less damage will 
be done.

Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places 111
Choosing a safe ATM
When you are going to use an ATM,
choose it carefully. Here are some tips
for choosing and using an ATM:
 Use an ATM that is both familiar
and comfortable to you.
 Scope out the area before you
approach the ATM. If you feel
uncomfortable for any reason,
move on.
 Have your ATM card out and in
your hand as you approach the
ATM.
 Check out the ATM. Look for any
signs that the machine has been
tampered with. For example, if
attachments are protruding from
the card slot or keypad, or if the
screen is blank, find a different
machine.
 Avoid using ATMs that have mes-
sages attached saying that the
instructions for use have changed;
banks don’t post such messages
directing you to use a specific
ATM.
 Observe other people using the
ATM, and notice if they are having
difficulty. It may be an indication
of trouble.
 Make sure that the area around is
well lighted at night.
 Be aware of your surroundings.
Watch the person next to you or
behind you.
 Use your body to hide what you
enter on the keypad.
 Take your receipt with you.
 Don’t forget to take your ATM card
from the slot.
 Avoid using non-bank ATM mach-
ines; they can be set up to collect
card and PIN numbers.

W
hen you order stuff by phone or online, you need to feel
comfortable doing it. If you do not feel comfortable, find
another way. What can make you feel uncomfortable? Well in
men, it is known as the gut feeling when something just doesn’t
seem quite right, and for women it’s known as intuition that
something doesn’t feel right. You have felt it, I’m sure, and
those times when you didn’t follow your instincts, you proba-
bly found out that you should have.
This chapter covers the ins and outs of ordering stuff safely
both online and by phone. Read on to find out how to enjoy the
convenience of telephone and online ordering while ensuring
that your personal information is safe.
Ordering Stuff by Phone
To order stuff by phone, all you need to provide is the name on
your credit card, the card number, and the expiration date. This
goes for small purchases and large purchases alike. For added

Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
114
security, some businesses ask for the three- or four-digit secu-
rity number on the back of the card, but your signature and
your photo ID are not verified. This purchasing scenario is
ideal for an identity thief who is using stolen credit cards.
Mike’s story: It happened to me
My wife and I used my credit card to
order a Turbo Cooker that was adver-
tised on TV. We received the product
a few weeks later as expected, but
when our monthly credit card state-
ment arrived and we checked it like
we always do, we noticed several
charges on the statement we did not
make.
I contacted the card company and 
told them that we did not make the
charges and wanted them removed
from the statement. The card company
removed the charges. But then the
next month’s statement had new
charges from the companies again. I
called the phone number that was next
to one of the charges and told them 
I did not authorize any charges from
their company and wanted them
removed from our card. I also called
the card company and talked to 
the fraud department. They said that
they were familiar with the company
making the charges, and they would
take care of it. On the next month’s
statement, the charges were removed.
The company advertising its product
on TV was legitimate, but one of the
people answering the phone or pro-
cessing the calls was not so trustwor-
thy. The card number was probably
provided to the company making the
unauthorized charges on our card for
a fee.
We were lucky because we check our
monthly credit card statement reli-
giously. Companies that make unau-
thorized charges are banking on the
fact that most people do not check
their monthly statements, and there-
fore, their charges are not disputed
immediately if at all.
I have ordered other things by phone
and have not had any problems.
Ordering stuff by phone is not inher-
ently unsafe but you do need to be
vigilant and check your monthly bill 
to make sure that it contains only
charges you authorized. If charges
appear that you did not authorize, dis-
pute them immediately.
The company selling the product we
purchased hired a firm to take the calls
and place the orders. This is the way
the problem occurred. The person
taking the information may not have
been honest and made a few extra
bucks selling credit card information.
The other possibility is the company
taking the calls didn’t shred the order
forms and someone did a little dump-
ster diving and found the credit card
numbers and used them.

When you place an order by phone, you need to know the
company — don’t call a company you’re not familiar with —
and you need to check your monthly statement. Problems
occur when you do not follow the simple rule of knowing 
who you are ordering stuff from and not checking your monthly
card statement. Do not order anything from unsolicited callers
offering a service or product, especially not if you would be
making the purchase on impulse.
Always get an order or confirmation number and the name 
of the customer service rep that helped you. Also record the
date and time you placed the order. This way, you have a fall-
back if something goes kerflooey with your order. This is a
good way to make yourself a harder target and, if the worst
happens, catch the thief. 
When you order stuff by phone, guard your privacy. Don’t use
a cell phone or place the order in a public place. It is too easy
for someone to eavesdrop on your call and capture your credit
card information.
Ordering Stuff Online
Purchasing merchandise online is incredibly easy, but you
must protect yourself. Here are several tips for safely ordering
stuff online by using an online pay service from the “How Stuff
Works” Web site, computer.howstuffworks.com/identity
theft5.htm.
 Use a smart card. When you use a smart card, the amount
of the purchase is subtracted from the balance on the
card, just like when you use a debit card or credit card.
 Use a stored value card, which is like the prepaid phone
card, where you purchase the card with a certain dollar
amount, and each time you use it the amount of the pur-
chase is subtracted from the balance.
 Use E-Wallet software, which is secure and allows you 
to purchase items by letting the merchant’s server send 
a message to your PC. Then you select the card that is
defined in your “Wallet” to make the purchase.
Chapter 9: Staying Safe Online and on the Phone 115

 Use digital cash. Digital cash is a series of credits you
purchase that is then stored on your PC. You spend the
credits by making purchases over the Internet.
 Use an online payment service where you can set up 
an account and make purchases drawing from the
account.
 Make purchases using a Point-Of-Sale Device (POS), 
like a personal digital assistant (PDA) or mobile phone. 
You make purchases, and the amount is added to your
monthly bill.
The most common method for purchasing items online is to
use a credit card. The following tips from How Stuff Works will
help you make purchasing merchandise on the Internet more
secure.
 Make sure that you are using the latest Internet browser.
The browser allows you to navigate the Internet and 
provides encryption. Encryption protects data sent to a
server by scrambling it. When you use the most recent
version of a browser, you are also using the latest version
of encryption technology.
 Only use one credit card to make purchases on the
Internet. This way, you can track your purchases and
activity on the card more easily. This is a good way to
keep a record of all your Internet transactions to help
ensure accuracy of the charges to your card. If the card
gets compromised, you can cancel it and get a new one.
 Digital certificates authenticate the Web site you are
accessing, and the VeriSign logo will be on the Web site.
When you click on the VeriSign logo, you can be assured
that the site is legitimate and not a redirect or clone.
 Check your e-mail for confirmation from the merchant
after you have completed a purchase. The merchants
usually send you an e-mail to confirm the order and 
when the item will be shipped to you.
 Read the Web site’s privacy policy. The policy will let you
know that personal information you provide will be kept
confidential and not sold or disclosed to others.
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
116

 Finally, do not give your password or ID online unless
you know who you are dealing with even if your ISP asks
you for it in an e-mail. This request is a scam and used by
identity thieves to collect personal information.
Check Your Monthly Card
Statement for Surprises
You should never encounter surprises on your monthly credit
card statement. After ordering stuff online or by telephone,
check your monthly bill closely. Look for any charges you don’t
recognize as one you have made. If you find surprises, dispute
them immediately by contacting your credit card company at
the number printed on your bill. Tell them that you are disput-
ing XYZ charges because you didn’t make them. Follow up your
phone call with a dispute letter (see Chapter 3 for a sample
letter from the FTC). 
Checking your credit card every month is a good idea. If you
find something on the statement that is not right, you can cor-
rect it immediately. The longer the problem goes undetected,
the more effort it will take to clear it up. If you pay the charge
without looking at your statement closely, you create more
work for yourself because now you not only have to dispute
the charge, but you also need to request your money back.
When you see a charge that you didn’t make or authorize, you
don’t have to pay it, and you can deduct it from the bill. The
credit card company can’t demand payment once you dispute
an item until the issue is resolved. If the card company’s inves-
tigation finds that you do in fact owe the money, it will be
added to the next bill; on the other hand, if the item disputed
is fraudulent, then you will not see the charge again unless it
is a new one.
Chapter 9: Staying Safe Online and on the Phone 117

Beware of Scams to Get
Personal Information
Identity thieves will stop at nothing to get your personal infor-
mation. Your best protection is to be aware of your environ-
ment and guard your personal information. The following
sections offer some guidance to keep you safe.
Who is calling?
Thieves often call folks on the phone and say that they are
from a bank or credit card company. The person on the phone
goes on and asks you for your full name, date of birth, SSN,
and credit card number. Don’t fall for these telephone scams,
which fall into the category of social engineering.
Thieves use a number of scams, and they vary the themes
every day. So before you leap and give the person on the other
end of the phone the personal information they are seeking,
ask why they need the information, and tell them that you will
get back to them after you check out their story. If you don’t
feel comfortable, don’t give the info.
Give personal information over the telephone only to persons
on calls you initiate. This way, you know who is on the line. Just
don’t give personal information over the telephone in a public
place or on your cell phone.
Phishing out a thief
“Back in the day,” as my kids would say, the identity thief
would collect the needed information the old fashioned way —
dumpster diving, picking up discarded credit card receipts,
rummaging for carbons of credit card receipts, stealing wallets
and purses, and eavesdropping.
Today, we have the Internet. The Internet contains a wealth 
of information at your fingertips, and its ease of use makes 
it a great tool for the identity thief to find those essential 
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
118

numbers (SSN, DOB, PIN, and so on). Identity thieves even 
use the Internet to have potential targets come to them. For
example, have you ever received a “SPAM” e-mail asking you
to verify some personal information? The technique is known
as Phishing.
Here is how it works: The e-mail, which claims to be from a
reputable source, such as your bank or credit card company,
requests that you click on a link and go to their Web site to
make sure that your information is correct. Once on the site,
you are asked to provide personal information to verify their
records. The information requested is your name, credit card
number, expiration date, SSN, DOB, and so on. This technique
is called Phishing because the person perpetrating the scam is
throwing a line or net to see who bites. Don’t fall for it.
I received one of these e-mails shortly after using an online
payment company. The e-mail said that my account would be
deleted if I did not provide the information requested. I did
not have an account with the company, and the timing of the
suspect e-mail was actually coincidental and random. (The
e-mail message started by saying, “Dear Customer” your
account needs to be updated — it wasn’t personalized.)
I didn’t reply to the message; I just deleted the suspect message.
Enough people must answer the e-mail to make the scam suc-
cessful; otherwise, identity thieves would not use it. Typically,
the scam is used for a short period, and then the thief shelves
it until the media hype and warnings about it die down. Then
they use it again with a slightly different perspective.
Here is a good Web site that provides information on e-mail
scams: www.moneytalks.org/content_article.asp?ID=649.
We’re from the government
The government doesn’t ask you for information in a public
way, such as in an e-mail. If they need to collect information —
especially if you are suspected to be in violation of something
like the Patriot Act, as described in the sidebar, “Homeland
Security scam” — a subpoena or search warrant is needed.
Chapter 9: Staying Safe Online and on the Phone 119

Table 9-1 gives you an idea of some of the information the gov-
ernment has about you. Most of the information is collected as
a matter of record-keeping, such as birth certificates, property
tax roles, real estate owned, and so on.

Most of the documents listed in Table 9-1 are considered 
to be public records, and anyone can get access to them.
Some documents, like your birth certificate (in some states),
SSN, tax information, and financial records, are not public.
Even the government will need to obtain a subpoena or
search warrant before they can examine your financial
records.
Part III: Staying Ahead of Identity Theft 
120

Why financial information?
Your financial information is the key to your identity, and you
need to protect it. Ask yourself this question, Why does that
business need my SSN anyway? You need to be suspicious of
anyone asking you for financial information.
If someone asks for your financial information in an e-mail,
that should be your first indication that something is not
right. Any financial institution you have done business 
with in the past knows your financial information, and if 
they want to update their files, they would not request the
information to be updated via e-mail. If you have done busi-
ness with them in the past, you probably know their Web 
site address, and the institution would need to provide a link
in an e-mail message.
To know whether the link to the Web site launches a real site,
look for the VeriSign logo shown in Figure 9-1. The logo indi-
cates that the site is authentic.
When you feel comfortable with a site and you are going to
perform a transaction of some kind, look for the lock at the
bottom right corner of your browser window before you com-
plete a form or application. Make sure that the lock is locked.
This way, you know that anything you transmit is encrypted. 
If you don’t see the lock or there is not another indication 
that the information is going to be sent encrypted over the
Internet, don’t provide the information. See Chapter 3 for more
details.
Bank examiner scam
The phony bank examiner scam has been around for a long,
long, time. It must be effective because every now and then
you hear about someone being victimized by it.
How the scam works is that a person poses as a bank exam-
iner or officer of the bank. The scam is set up with a phone
call. The caller tells the victim that he or she is an officer of
the bank where the victim has an account, and there has been
Chapter 9: Staying Safe Online and on the Phone 121

a computer glitch or some other problem, and the bank must
verify some information. The caller asks the victim about their
account balance, any recent activity, and so on. Next the scam-
mer tries to determine whether the victim lives alone, and if
the phony bank officer is successful in obtaining the needed
information, the caller thanks the victim and tells him or her
they will call back if there are any problems. 
The scammer does call back after a brief period of time and
asks the victim again for assistance in catching a dishonest
teller the bank suspects of stealing from customer’s accounts
including the victim’s account. The victim is asked to withdraw
a large sum of money from their account and turn it over to a
bank examiner. 
The scammer posing as a bank examiner tells the victim that a
dummy account has been set up in their name for the transac-
tion. Assurances are made that the account that has been set
up is fully insured, and the victim will not lose any money to
the dishonest teller. The victim withdraws the agreed upon
amount.
The scammer uses scare tactics to convince you to help. 
He or she tells you that your bank account is being drained,
and if you don’t act soon, you will have no money left in the
account — the crooks will have it all.

Homeland Security scam
In a scam that surfaced recently, the
Patriot Act and the FDIC are used
fraudulently to get your personal infor-
mation. Here’s how the scam works:
An e-mail is sent stating that Tom
Ridge, the Department of Homeland
Security Director, has advised the
FDIC to suspend all deposit insurance
on your bank accounts because of
suspected violations of the Patriot Act.
The e-mail goes on to say that all
deposit insurance will be suspended
until your personal identity, including
bank account information, can be ver-
ified. The FDIC has distributed an alert
stating that the e-mail is fraudulent
and further warns that clicking on the
link in the e-mail may activate a virus
named Exploit-URLSpoof.gen.
The FDIC has set up an alert repository
at alert@fdic.gov that you can
use to report receipt of one of these
e-mails.

A meeting is arranged for the victim and the phony bank
examiner, and at the meeting, the victim is told by the phony
bank examiner that the money actually came from the dummy
account and not the victim’s account, and the money is needed
as evidence. The phony bank examiner gives the victim a
receipt for the money. The victim never sees the money or 
the phony bank examiner again.
In another variation of the scheme, the phony bank examiner
asks that the victim withdraw the money and mark the bills.
The money is given to the phony bank examiner, who says
that he or she will redeposit the money to see if the teller in
question alters the deposit slip. The victim’s money and the
phony bank examiner are never seen or heard from again.
A bank examiner or law enforcement officer would never ask
you to use your own money in any investigation. Besides,
financial institutions never involve their customers in their
investigations.
Most scams work because they play to the trusting nature of
the victim. It is important to know the telltale signs of a scam
so you just hang up the phone when you hear it. If it sounds
too good to be true it probably is a scam of some kind.

f you discover that you’re a victim, don’t panic. You 
can reclaim your identity. In this part of the book, I tell
you what forms to complete and how to contact the gov-
ernment agencies that will help you with your ﬁght. I also
provide some information about closing compromised
accounts and opening new accounts.

I
n this chapter, I guide you through the paperwork neces-
sary to regain your good name and credit if you have been
a victim. Doing paperwork is not the most exciting exercise,
but in the case of identity theft, doing the work is important
and will help you in the long run.
Filling Out the Initial Reports
Completing the initial reports is the first step in regaining
your identity. The first report is the police report. For this
report, you must be persistent because some jurisdictions
may not be as responsive as others to identity theft cases.
Next in the process is to place a fraud alert on your credit
report.

Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
128
Placing a fraud alert 
on your credit report
The fraud alert requests creditors to contact you before open-
ing any new accounts or making any changes to your existing
accounts. As soon as the credit bureau confirms your fraud
alert, the other two credit bureaus will be automatically noti-
fied to place fraud alerts, and all three credit reports will be
sent to you free of charge.
Here is the contact information for each credit bureau’s fraud
division:
Equifax
800/525-6285
P.O. Box 740250
Atlanta, GA 30374
Experian
888/397-3742
P.O. Box 1017
Allen, TX 75013
TransUnion
800/680-7289
P.O. Box 6790
Fullerton, CA 92634
You don’t need a copy of your credit report. All you need to do
is call. The credit bureau will send you a copy of your credit
report when you put the alert on.
Reporting the crime 
to law enforcement
Because identity theft is a crime, you should file a report with
law enforcement where the crime occurred. There are various
local enforcement agencies, city police, sheriff’s departments,
county police, and town or village police. Contact one of the
agencies, and they will let you know whether you have the
right jurisdiction for reporting the crime; if you don’t, they
will tell you which one to contact and provide you with the
contact information.

For most jurisdictions, you can contact the local law enforce-
ment agency by telephone to file the report. When you do so,
you will be given a report number. You need to send this report
number to your creditors along with your completed fraud
affidavit.
Completing an ID theft affidavit
The fraud affidavit is found on the FTC Web site under identity
theft at www.ftc.gov. You must send the copy of the police
report and the completed affidavit to all your creditors. The
following is the process for completing the fraud affidavit.
 To fill out the form, you must download and print it; you
cannot complete the form online. Included in the instruc-
tions are the addresses for all three major credit bureaus.
 You have the option to notarize the form. A space is pro-
vided for a Notary to sign. You are not required by law to
have the form notarized. Some businesses do not require
the form to be notarized, but doing so may persuade them
to accept the form as more credible. Note that you must
pay a fee to have the forms notarized.
 Some creditors will want you to complete their own dis-
pute form. Call them to find out if they require you to fill
out a separate form, and then follow up the phone request
in writing. Send the letter certified mail return receipt so
that you have a record of the request. There are spaces
to fill in the police report information, including agency
report number, the name of the officer or person taking
the report, and the e-mail address of the agency.
 The affidavit has a documentation checklist that includes
a valid government issued picture identification card,
such as a driver’s license, state-issued identification card,
or passport. The last item in this section is proof of resi-
dency during the time the event or disputed transaction
took place.
 The affidavit has a chart where you can list all the accounts
that were opened fraudulently with the address of the
company where the account was opened, the account
number, type of account (for example, auto loan, credit
card, or mortgage), the date it was opened, and for what
amount. You send the chart to the credit bureaus as a part
Chapter 10: Joining Forces in the Identity Theft Battle 129

of the affidavit. The chart is also a valuable tool for you to
track what contacts have been made and their response.
 You must send the affidavit to the fraud department of
each creditor, bank, or utility that provided the identity
thief with unauthorized credit, or purchases and services.
Some companies have their own dispute forms; they will
send them to you after they receive your affidavit. Still
other companies do not accept the affidavit and will only
accept their own dispute form and a police report, but
you will not know until you send it them.
Figure 10-1 shows the sections of the report from the Federal
Trade Commission Web site. Each of the sections is explained
briefly in the next section.
Figure 10-1: Fraud affidavit.
Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
130

Chapter 10: Joining Forces in the Identity Theft Battle 131

After you complete the form, send it to one of the credit
bureaus and have a fraud alert placed on your credit report.
The credit bureau you send it to will automatically send to 
the other two bureaus. 
Taking Care of Compromised
Accounts: The First Steps
When you discover that your accounts have been compro-
mised, follow the steps in the following sections to stop their
misuse. Waiting will not help your cause. As soon as you find
out that some of your accounts have been compromised, check
all of your accounts.
Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
132

Call your credit card company
Take out your contact sheet of credit card companies (see
Chapter 2). The contact information you need, including
account numbers and the credit card phone number, should
be on your list.
Call your credit card company, and let them know that you
have been the victim of identity theft. Keep a journal listing the
person you spoke to when you called, the date and time, and
a summary of the conversation for your records. For a sample
journal see Table 10-1. You can use Microsoft Excel to make
your journal, or you can use a table in Microsoft Word — it
doesn’t make a difference as long as you include the informa-
tion I list in the sample.
Make sure that you record all the information on the form in
the Fraudulent Account Statement section (see Figure 10-2).
Then follow up your phone conversation by sending a copy of
your completed Fraudulent Account Statement form for that
credit company.

If you are disputing fraudulent charges on your credit card,
tell the card company and follow up the conversation in 
writing using the Fraudulent Account statement shown in
Figure 10-2.
Chapter 10: Joining Forces in the Identity Theft Battle 133

Figure 10-2: Fraudulent Account Statement.
Finally, tell your credit card company that you have placed a
fraud alert on your credit report.
Keep copies of everything you send to any creditors. Send all
correspondence to any creditors certified mail return receipt,
and keep the return receipts for your files.
Call your bank
Once you realize you have been a victim, don’t forget to call
your bank. You should have the contact information on file
(see Chapter 2). Ask your bank to freeze your accounts if you
see evidence that they have been compromised.
For checking accounts, the bank will want to know which
checks you have outstanding. A quick look at your check reg-
ister should provide the information you need. The accounts
Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
134

may need to be closed and new ones opened. If your checks
are lost or stolen, for example, the person or persons using
your checks can drain your account in short order. To get
more details about personal checks, see Chapter 2.
Chapter 11 contains specifics about closing compromised
accounts, and Chapter 12 contains instructions for opening
new ones.
If you are the victim of identity theft and you feel that one or
more of your bank accounts have been or will be compromised,
close the accounts and open new ones.
Choose a new PIN for your new ATM card. Don’t use the old
one in case it has been compromised, as well.
Asking for fraud dispute forms
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a fraud affidavit form
(see the section, “Completing an ID theft affidavit”), but some
creditors have their own dispute forms and may not accept the
FTC Identity Theft affidavit form. You must ask whether they
have their own form and have them send it to you.
On the form, enter the information about your conversation
using the information in the sample journal in Table 10-1. If the
creditor has its own form, mark the dispute form column with
a yes. You already recorded the date of the call in your journal;
this date will serve as the date you requested the dispute form,
as well.
The credit bureaus have their own dispute forms, too. Chap-
ter 6 shows a sample dispute form from Experian. You simply
order the form online. Remember that you need a current
credit report number, no older than 90 (Equifax is 60 days, 
not 90) days, to file a dispute.
Don’t get bullied into paying for charges you didn’t make on
accounts you didn’t open. Stand your ground. After you file
the dispute or ID theft affidavit for the fraudulent accounts
and charges, you don’t have to pay the disputed charges, and
the charges can’t be given to a collection agency, per the Fair
and Accurate Credit Transaction Act.
Chapter 10: Joining Forces in the Identity Theft Battle 135

Getting Straight with 
the Government
If you are a victim of identity theft, you need to let the govern-
ment know. Filing a complaint with the FTC will help your case.
The FTC reports the theft to the appropriate law enforcement
agency, as well. The FTC does not investigate the crime of
identity theft.
Filing a complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission has a complaint form on their
Web site, www.ftc.gov. Simply follow the link to identity 
theft by clicking on the for consumers link (see Figure 10-3)
and then click on identity theft (see Figure 10-4). Scroll 
to number 4, and click on file your complaint (see Figure
10-5). The link takes you to the ID Theft Complaint Input Form.
The form is interactive and can be completed online. The Web
site uses SSL encryption to transmit the information you pro-
vide on the form.
The FTC does not resolve individual identity theft issues, but
the complaints do help the FTC investigate fraud that will
sometimes lead to law enforcement action.
The amount of information you provide when completing the
form is up to you. The most important information to provide is
your contact information. Without it, the FTC will not be able to
contact you. Although the FTC does not investigate individual
cases, you can help them investigate the crime of fraud, which
may lead to successful law enforcement. The FTC will look into
complaints that you made about how the credit bureaus and
other businesses handled your complaint to them, as well.

The second section asks the complainant to tell the FTC about
the problem and is divided into six subsections. Figure 10-7
shows the section of the form that asks for the type of identity
theft you have experienced.
The next two sections ask you to describe the complaint and
provide details of the theft. Figure 10-7 shows what is asked
for on the report.
I recommend that you go to the FTC Web site and look at the
ID Theft Complaint Form so that if you ever need to complete
the form, you are familiar with it.
What to do if your SSN has 
been used to get a job
The Social Security Administration (SSA) doesn’t help con-
sumers fix their credit problems. They will help, however, if
someone other than you uses your SSN to get a job. To get
help from the SSA, visit their Web site at www.ssa.gov. When
you get to the site, click on the icon for (see Figure 10-8). Then
Chapter 10: Joining Forces in the Identity Theft Battle 139

click on the icon How to report a lost or stolen Social
Security card (see Figure 10-9). Next, click on the icon
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10064.html
(see Figure 10-10).
Here are some tips to protect your SSN:
 Always protect your SSN; don’t give it out freely.
 Never carry your SSN in your wallet or purse.
 Make sure that you secure your personal records at
home to prevent a thief from finding your SSN.
 After your application for credit has been completed,
request that only the last digits of your SSN appear on
any copies and ask that the original application be
destroyed in your presence.

Closing Compromised
Accounts

 Closing credit accounts
C
losing and opening new bank accounts is not anyone’s
idea of a fun-filled afternoon, but if your accounts have
been compromised, you need to close out the accounts. This
chapter is about closing compromised accounts. To close out
your accounts you need to appear at the local branch of your
bank so you can show some form of ID.
Closing Out Bank Accounts
When should you close your bank account? Close accounts
when you notice unauthorized withdrawals on your monthly
statements from your bank. Look for checks you didn’t write
for stuff you didn’t purchase, or cash you never withdrew
yourself.
Naturally, close any accounts that have been opened in your
name fraudulently. Don’t forget to check your credit report for
fraudulently opened accounts. Notify your bank or any other
financial institutions where these accounts reside and tell them

Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
144
that the accounts were not opened by you and that you have
been the victim of identity theft. Send the fraud affidavit to the
bank (or use their fraud form if they don’t accept the fraud
affidavit).
It is better to be safe even though closing the account may be
a pain. Closing savings accounts is not usually as much of a
pain as closing a checking account because you don’t have to
balance them, but they are equally important — your money
is your money.
When your ATM card 
goes missing
You are at the automatic teller machine ready to withdraw
some cash, but you can’t find your ATM card. Don’t panic; 
let your bank know immediately — even on weekends and 
holidays. You can do this several ways.
 You can go to your bank’s online Web site and report the
lost card.
 You can call the bank at the number that is printed on
your monthly statement and report the lost card.
 You can visit a branch of your bank during business
hours and report the lost card.
When you report the lost card, the bank will cancel the card
immediately, and a new one will be issued in about 10 days.
When you are traveling, even in foreign countries, most banks
will arrange to send you a new temporary card overnight for
your convenience. Because the possibility of someone having
your PIN and using the card to drain your checking account is
small, you probably don’t need to close the account. On the
other hand, if the ATM is connected to your savings account,
you may want to close the account and open a new one.
Several years ago, I forgot to take my card from an ATM at a
branch of my bank. I didn’t realize that I left the card until I
arrived at work. The bank was close to where I worked, so I
went back to see if the card was still in the machine. It wasn’t,

so I immediately called the bank and they cancelled the card
and issued me a new one. It arrived in about 10 days. The card
couldn’t be used until I activated it. I also changed my PIN. 
I checked the balances in my accounts when I spoke to the
bank representative on the phone, and the accounts were not
compromised, so I didn’t close out the accounts. I checked my
monthly statement religiously every month and encountered
no problems.
To limit your liability to $50 for the lost ATM if it is used to
drain your bank accounts you must report the loss within 
48 hours; otherwise, you may be liable for $500 in loss from
your accounts. ATM/debit cards have the same zero liability
as a credit card. This means that by law, you are held only to
the $50 maximum if you weren’t negligent and reported the
theft in a timely fashion. In practice, financial institutions are
not holding to the $50, but are claiming zero liability for PR
and marketing. Also, the reporting requirement is from the
time you discover the loss, not necessarily when the loss
occurred.
When you review your monthly account statement and notice
unauthorized withdrawals on your statement, you need to
report it to your bank immediately. You have only 60 days
from the date the account was mailed to you to report any
unauthorized withdrawals on your monthly statement or 
you can potentially lose all the money in your account.
Make sure that you add your ATM card to the list of notifica-
tions you need to make if your wallet or purse is stolen.
Remember to report the stolen ATM card to your bank within
the two-day time frame, and be sure to review your monthly
statement and report any unauthorized withdrawals within
the 60-day time limit.
Reporting to check-verification
companies
If your personal checks have been lost or stolen, contact 
your bank and freeze your account. Have the bank contact
Chapter 11: Closing Compromised Accounts 145

ChexSystems to alert them that your checks have been lost 
or stolen. ChexSystems is the network used by banks and
credit unions to report mishandled checking accounts, which
are overdrawn accounts. Only banks that subscribe to the
service can report mishandled accounts, but as a consumer
you can report stolen or lost checks. Members report the 
history of account mishandling and the outstanding debt.
You can order a consumer report from ChexSystems to see
what is in your file. Simply go to www.chexhelp.com and follow
the link to order your consumer report.
Don’t forget to contact your local police department and
report the lost or stolen checks. You also should call one of
the check-verification companies listed in Table 11-1 and tell
them that your checks have been lost or stolen.

send to close your credit accounts. You can modify the letter
to meet your needs.
Ask for written confirmation that the account has been closed.
The credit company does not close accounts automatically
that you have not used that are paid in full and have a zero
balance. You need to tell them to close the accounts. Cutting

Opening New Accounts
In This Chapter
 Opening new accounts
 Keeping tabs on your new accounts
 Having your personal check order sent to your bank
 Using a new PIN for the new account
 Opening new credit accounts
I
n this chapter, I outline the things you need to do when you
open your new accounts. I show you how to keep tabs on
the account balances, help you pick a new PIN for your new
account, and prompt you to change your paycheck direct
deposit over to your new account.
Opening New Bank Accounts
After you close your old bank accounts, you need to open new
ones. For your new checking accounts, you will be issued tem-
porary checks to use until your permanent ones are printed.
The temporary checks will not have your name, address, or
phone number printed on them, so be prepared for the third
degree when you use them.
At the time you open the new account, you will be asked to
choose a check layout from several options. Arrange to pick
up your new checks at the bank — don’t have them sent to
your home address. I know that making a trip to the bank to
pick up your check supply is inconvenient, but if your mail 
is being targeted, you don’t want to give the thief your new
blank checks to steal. You’d be back to square one!

Part IV: Taking Back Your Good Name 
150
The bank usually prints your name, address, and telephone
number on your checks as well as your account number, the
bank routing number, and the name and address of your bank.
These checks contain all the information the ID thief needs to
make up a fake ID to pass your checks as his or hers, so don’t
make it easy for thieves to steal them from you.
Table 12-1 is a quick checklist to use as a guide for opening
new accounts. The checklist is not all-inclusive, but it gives
you a good idea of what needs to be done when you open a
new account. Add to the checklist as necessary to ensure that
you cover the important items.

Ask for New ATM card and make up new PIN —
don’t use your old PIN.
Check account balance.
Tell your employer your new account number for
your paycheck deposit.
Maintaining good records
The balance in the new accounts is probably the transfer of
the balance from the old account. As you did with your old
accounts, you need to keep tabs on the balances in the new
accounts. You should review the initial account balance and
check it against your first monthly statement to make sure the
account has not been compromised.

Keeping good records is important. The checks you write,
deposit receipts you receive, your direct deposit stub from
your paycheck, and more — all this can be of value to you
when you balance your checkbook. Then when you receive
your monthly statement, you will be able to keep tabs on the
balance in the account.
Your savings account balance is a little easier to keep tabs 
on. Because you don’t write checks on the account, you can
check the account balance simply by reviewing the monthly
statement your bank sends to you. The only thing you need 
to track are the withdrawals you make. Keep your ATM and
withdrawal receipts so that you can compare them to your
monthly statements.
The only way you can keep tabs on your new or existing
account balances is review your monthly statement reli-
giously and call your bank if there are any errors.
Using a new PIN
So you closed your old accounts and opened new ones. You
now have new account numbers, but what about your PIN?
You were probably given a new ATM card. Did you remember
to change your PIN, as well? It is better to be safe than sorry 
if you closed the accounts because they were compromised.
How do you know that your PIN was not also compromised?
When you change account numbers for any reason, change
your PIN, as well, regardless of whether your PIN has been
compromised.
Chapter 12: Opening New Accounts 151
Rerouting your paycheck
What account is your paycheck being
deposited into? If you closed your
existing account that your paycheck
was deposited in, did you remember
to notify your employer of the change
in accounts? You don’t want your pay-
check bouncing around out there in
the cold hard world and not have a
warm, friendly home to be deposited
in. To make the change, your employer
needs a voided check from your new
checking account, similar to what
you provided when you initiated direct
deposit on the old account. 

Choose a new PIN that is easy for you to memorize (so that
you don’t need to write it down) and hard for others to guess.
And remember — don’t use the last four digits of your SSN or
your birthday. If you must use a phone number, use a friend’s
phone number or birthday, or some other number that you
can remember easily but that a thief won’t be able to guess
correctly.
Opening New Credit Accounts
To maintain a good credit score (see Chapter 6 for more infor-
mation on credit scores), don’t open two new credit accounts
at one time. You’re better off to stagger the new accounts. The
reason is that the new accounts have not aged, so they don’t
have a credit history.
If you have been the victim of identity theft and filed all the
proper notifications and closed all compromised and fraudu-
lent accounts (see Chapter 10 for more details), however, you
can open new credit accounts without compromising your
credit rating. But don’t overdo it.
The fewer accounts you have, the better — especially since you
are in the situation where you are trying to clean up the mess
left by the identity thief. It is easier to track a few accounts than
to try to track a large number of accounts. To help track your
credit accounts, I recommend that you subscribe to one of the
online services outlined in Chapter 6.
When you open new credit accounts, you will probably need
to show proof that you are who you say you are. Remember
the fraud alert you placed on your credit report? The fraud
alert will require creditors to verify your identity, and you 
will be notified by the credit bureau that an inquiry has been
made about your credit. For more details on credit reports,
see Chapter 6, and for information on placing a fraud alert on
your credit report, see Chapter 10.

A

help guide you through the process of reclaiming your
identity if you have been a victim.

Ten Tips to Make
Reclaiming Your Identity 
Go More Smoothly
In This Chapter
 Exploring the art of the checklist
 Making a journal the easy way
 Getting writer’s cramp from documenting
 Keeping records (but not your greatest hits)
T
he following sections tell you how to reclaim your identity
in the easiest way possible. Use these as guidelines to help
you navigate your way through the process more smoothly.
Follow a Checklist
It is time to get organized. If you are the victim of identity
theft, you can use the checklist in Chapter 3 to get organized
and plan your counterattack, or you can create your own.
Whether you use the checklist in this book or make up your
own doesn’t matter; you just need to follow a checklist. The
checklist is your roadmap to help you navigate your way
through the issues you face and the tasks you need to do in
order to reclaim your identity.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
156
Keep a Journal
If you take nothing else away from this book, know that the
more you document about your case, the better off you are 
in the end. Document everything in detail, keep copies of
everything you send out, and keep summaries of phone 
conversations. You can’t over document, but you can short-
change yourself if you do it too sparingly. Your journal should
list all the people and organizations you have contacted, 
their titles, dates, and a brief summary of the conversation 
if it was by telephone. This will be a valuable reference for
your follow-up work. Documenting everything during the 
fight to restore your credit and good name seems like a dis-
traction, but it isn’t. Your journal can be a valuable tool in 
the fight.
Your journal is a record of what you did, and when and any-
thing you can put in your arsenal to help you reclaim your good
name and good credit. Chapter 3 provides some examples to
help you.
Complete a Fraud Affidavit
As soon as you realize that you have been the victim of iden-
tity theft, you need to complete a fraud affidavit and send it 
to your creditors. The affidavit is the first step on the road to
reclaiming your identity. The fraud affidavit can be found on
the Federal Trade Commission Web site as the Fraud Affidavit
(see Chapter 10 for more details). Copies of each affidavit you
send out should be kept in your journal along with the certi-
fied return receipt.
Completing the fraud affidavit is not difficult, but it can be
time-consuming. You need to complete one for each creditor,
but you can streamline the process by completing the victim
information section and make copies to use for all the rest of
the creditors and banks to whom you are sending the form. 
Be sure to sign each one before you send it, and don’t forget
to make and keep copies for your journal.

Send the affidavits via U.S. Post Office certified mail return
receipt. The certified mail receipt will serve as proof that the
addressee received the document. Keep the receipts for your
journal.
Record All Correspondence 
with Creditors
Keep a record of all verbal and written correspondence with
creditors. If you choose verbal correspondence, you can use 
a tape reorder to make a record of the conversation, but you
need to get permission from the other party before you can
record the conversation. If you don’t get permission, you are
breaking the wire-tapping law. You can ask for permission and
then have the person repeat for the tape recorder that they
have granted you permission. When you use a tape recorder,
make sure that you preface the conversation with the repeat
of the approval to record and the date, time, and the name 
of the person and organization’s name for your records.
Follow up the conversation with a written summary of what
was discussed.
For written correspondence, keep a journal of who (person
and organization you addressed the correspondence to), what
(fraudulent account, dispute charge, and so on), when (date),
where (location, store), and a brief summary of the context of
the document. Also keep a copy of the complete document that
was sent and any documents you receive.
Follow-up
An important part of the process is follow-up. Just because
you called and sent correspondence to close fraudulent
accounts or to dispute charges does not mean that your
issues will be addressed. You need to follow up, or nothing
will happen.
Chapter 13: Ten Tips to Reclaiming Your Identity  157

Follow up all your telephone conversations with written corre-
spondence and all your written correspondence with telephone
calls. Your journal will come in handy to help you track when
follow up needs to be done.
Set up a tickler file. In the tickler file, you list the name of 
the person you contacted, and when and how you contacted
them. The tickler file is used to track whom you have con-
tacted along with the next time you should contact them for
further follow-up.
You should follow up within one week from your initial contact.
After the first follow-up, ask when you can expect to hear from
them. Mark your calendar. If you don’t hear back, contact them
again.
Be persistent, but be tactful. You catch more flies with honey
than with vinegar; being caustic will not help your cause. If
you seem to not be getting any place with a particular person,
then by all means ask to talk to someone higher up the ladder.
Remember that your problem is not their problem; they are
not the one who had their identity stolen. How you approach
them will help you ensure that you’re their problem, as well.
Place a Fraud Alert on 
Your Credit Report
Contact one of the three credit bureaus and place a fraud alert
on your credit report. This action will be extremely helpful in
keeping the identity thief from continuing to use your good
name and credit. The fraud alert requires that any time an
application for credit is completed, the person completing 
the application provide proof of identity. In addition, the
credit bureaus notify you before the credit is approved.
You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting
the fraud department of one of the credit bureaus. Even though
a fraud alert on your credit report is not a cure-all, it is a good
first step to reclaiming your good name and credit.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
158

Sometimes creditors ignore the fraud alert, so it is advisable
for you to review your credit report regularly to see if there
are any accounts that have been opened without your 
knowledge.
Document when you contacted the credit bureau to place the
fraud alert on your credit report. Also include the name and
title of the person to whom you spoke, and a summary of the
discussion. If they send you written documentation, place the
correspondence in your journal.
File a Police Report
Another important task for you to do is to file a police report.
The police report needs to be filed in the city, town, or county,
where the identity theft occurred. If your mail was taken from
your mailbox, you must contact your local law enforcement
agency. On the other hand, if your wallet or purse was stolen,
you need to file a police report where the wallet or purse was
stolen.
A police report will help you convince creditors that you have
in fact been the victim of identity theft. The police report
should be sent with the fraud affidavit you send to creditors.
When you call or go in person to file the police report, be per-
sistent and ask for the financial or fraud crimes division. The
report will most likely be taken over the telephone. There may
be a follow-up visit or contact by the detective assigned to the
case, or the report number may be all the contact you have
about your report. This does not mean that the police are not
working the case; it means that they don’t need any further
information from you at the present time. It wouldn’t hurt if
you add contacting the police to get a status report on your
case to your follow-up effort.
Document in your journal the date and time you asked for a
copy of the report to be sent to you, the agency from which
you made the request, and the report number. When you
receive the copy of the report, place it in your journal.
Chapter 13: Ten Tips to Reclaiming Your Identity  159

Dispute Charges You 
Didn’t Make
Don’t be pressured into paying charges you didn’t make or
authorize. Even if the amount is small, don’t pay. The creditors
will try and recoup some of their losses from you by telling you
that if you pay this small amount, you will be helping yourself
because the charge will not go to collections. Well, once you
dispute a charge and have sent your creditor a dispute letter,
it can’t go to collections by law until it is resolved one way or
the other.
Credit card companies are usually quick to fix any charges
that are truly fraudulent. I can attest to this since I have had
fraudulent charges placed on my credit cards in the past.
If the credit account was opened fraudulently, request it be
closed and follow up with written documentation. Summarize
the conversations in writing and place copies of any documents
sent in your journal.
Report Your Stolen Checks to
One of the Check Verification
Companies
Just reporting and closing your compromised checks to your
bank may not be enough. The bank may not report the theft or
counterfeiting of your checks to one of the check verification
companies outlined in Chapter 11. You should also report the
loss or counterfeiting of your checks to one of the check veri-
fication companies, even if you close the account and open a
new one. You want to make sure that the incident is reported
and your name is not added to the list of people who pass bad
checks. Even if you open a new checking account, the problem
will still plague you.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
160

The check verification companies have contact phone numbers
for you to call and report stolen or lost checks. The phone
numbers and several check verification companies are listed
in Chapter 11.
Make sure that you document that you have opened a new
account and that you notified your bank, the name of your
contact at the bank, the date of your conversation, and the
reason for closing your old account and opening the new one.
Close Compromised Accounts
Close all compromised accounts, including accounts that
were opened fraudulently or accounts to which a thief has
gained access. Keep any paperwork that shows the date the
accounts were closed. Also include the name of the person
you contacted to close the accounts. Place all this documenta-
tion in your journal.
When you close compromised credit card accounts, don’t just
cut up the card and send the pieces to them. Be sure to include
a letter similar to the one in Chapter 12 stating that you are
closing the account and the reason. Then keep a record of all
the correspondence in your journal. Record the name of your
contact, the date you spoke, and a summary of any telephone
conversations.

Chapter 14: Ten Handy Resources 165
Identity theft solutions services
Credit card companies provide an
array of services to help protect you
from identity theft and credit card
fraud. Here is a description of some
of the services provided:
 Citi Cards come with a free serv-
ice to help cardmembers get their
identity back if they are a victim.
The Citi(r) Identity Theft Solutions
provides an identity theft special-
ist. You as a cardmember can call
an 800 number if you are a victim,
and an identity theft specialist is
assigned to help you file a police
report and close accounts with
creditors. The Citi(r) Identity Theft
Specialist will stay on the phone
with you as you place a fraud alert
on your credit report. Also, Citi will
send you an Identity Theft Toolkit.
The toolkit has fraud affidavit
forms, which they call a Security
Affidavit, an Identity Theft Work-
sheet, and an information book-
let provided by the Federal Trade
Commission and Citi.
 MasterCard International has a
Zero Liability program. The pro-
gram is for any purchases made
online, by telephone, or in stores.
 American Express has a program
where you as a card holder don’t
pay anything — not even the first
$50 — for fraudulent charges
made on the card. American
Express also has a fraud detection
program that looks for uncharac-
teristic or unusually high charges
made on your card. The program
looks at your normal spending and
then flags any charge that seems
out of the ordinary for you. When
such a charge is detected, a card
company representative calls you
to verify that you are making the
charge. If you are not making the
charge, the charge is denied.
Finally, you can call American
Express toll-free or access your
account online to report any
charge on your monthly statement
that is fraudulent, and American
Express will in most cases tem-
porarily credit your account until
further investigation is completed.
Like all of the credit issuers,
American Express will perma-
nently remove the charge from
your account once it is proven to
be fraudulent.
Remember, it is up to you which card
you choose and what extra services
you purchase, but it will all be for
naught if you don’t check your monthly
statement every month. The reason for
checking the statement every month
is simple: You can’t report what you
don’t know.

Most major banks in the United States issue Visa and Master-

and they tell you what to do if you lose your card or if your
card is stolen.
Credit Report Services
These are services such as those provided by the credit
report bureaus that give you unlimited credit reports and
e-mail alerts of any inquiries into your credit. All three of 
the credit bureaus provide these services. (See Chapter 6 
for more details.)
Companies that are not affiliated with the credit bureaus 
provide these services, as well. The services are worth the
annual fee because you will have unlimited access to your
credit report. The only drawback is that you have access to
only the credit report of the credit bureau’s service to which
you have a subscription.
I recommend purchasing a three-in-one report at least once
per year. The three-in-one report gives the status of your credit
across all three bureaus for easy comparison.
You should seriously think about subscribing to one of 
the services. I have found it helpful, and it is reassuring to
know I can go online and look at my credit report any time 
I want.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
166

Registration Services
Registration services are the opt-out requests that are sent to
you by your financial institutions, credit card companies, and
so on. The opt-out form is important — it helps you minimize
the amount of credit card offers you receive in the mail, or
through telephone solicitations.
To opt out of other credit offers, call (888) 567-8688. (See
Chapter 3 for more details.) The call takes 30 seconds, and
you will notice a dramatic decrease in the amount of credit
card offers sent to you in the mail.
Here are two other lists you may want to contact to opt out:
Mail Preference Service
Direct Marketing Association
P.O. Box 9008
Farmingdale, NY 11735
You can also opt-out via the Web site http://www.dma
consumers.org/cgi/offmailinglistdave but it will cost
you $5.00.
Telephone Preference Service
Direct Marketing Association
P.O. Box 9014
Farmingdale, NY 11735
These two addresses are for you to opt out of Direct Marketing
Association mailing lists. The first one is for mail and the second
one is for telephone solicitations. Another way to be removed
from the telephone solicitations lists is to go to the FTC site
and add your name and telephone number to the National Do
Not Call Registry. To add your name to the list is free.
There are several other mailing lists you can also send corre-
spondence to opt out. The lists are as follows:

dentity thieves use numerous scams to trick you into giving
up personal information. In this chapter, I discuss the ten
most common scams and how you can protect yourself from
becoming a victim to them. Most of the so-called new scams
are variations on the theme of the ten most common ones.
Phishing
The term Phishing is pronounced “fishing” and is exactly that —
except that the fish they are attempting to reel in is you and
me and not game fish, like salmon or striped bass. 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
170
Phishing is a way to get information by sending out spam
e-mail to a large number of people. The e-mails usually
request information by saying that your ATM/debit card
number and PIN need to be verified by a financial institution
because they “lost your data” in an upgrade to their software
program, which was done because of all the fraud that has
taken place. 
A link for a Web site is provided for you to type in your infor-
mation. You are told in the e-mail that if you don’t provide the
information, your account will be suspended. 
These e-mails usually have errors in grammar and spelling,
and look like someone lacking a good command of the English
language wrote it.
When you click on the link in the e-mail, you are taken to a Web
site that is not really the Web site of the institution mentioned
in the e-mail. The site is set up for the thieves to capture your
ATM/debit card number and PIN so that they help themselves
to your money. 
Another recent scam is circulating in which victims are sent
an e-mail stating that they are under investigation by the IRS.
In the e-mail, the victims are informed that they can assist 
in the investigation by providing “real” information and are
directed to a Web site that looks official. Once on the site, 
victims are asked to provide personal information such as
their SSN, drivers’ license numbers, bank account numbers,
and credit card numbers. The information is requested under
the guise that if you cooperate, the “IRS” can quickly clear 
up the matter.
The IRS never sends e-mail to contact taxpayers about issues
concerning their accounts. The IRS sends letters on IRS sta-
tionery in an IRS envelope sent via the U.S. Post Office. Don’t
be duped: Ignore the e-mail and contact the criminal investiga-
tion division of the IRS to let them know that you received an
e-mail requesting personal information.
To avoid becoming a victim of phishing, just don’t reply to the
e-mails soliciting personal information no matter how con-
vincing they may seem. Discard the e-mail and contact your
financial institution and let them know about the scam. 

Internet Scambusters, www.scambusters.org, lists all the
known e-mail scams that are currently being distributed. You
can also subscribe to a free e-mail newsletter that outlines the
latest scams and is a monthly publication.
The Bank Examiner Scam
Chapter 9 explains how the bank examiner scam works in
detail. In a nutshell, the thief approaches you stating that they
are investigating a dishonest teller and says that a bank offi-
cial will be contacting you about how you can help. The bank
official will want you to withdraw your own money to help
with the investigation. To avoid falling victim to this old scam,
remember that law enforcement does not ask you for money
to conduct an investigation. Most of the time, law enforce-
ment conducts the investigation without soliciting any help.
This helps keep the investigation covert so that those under
investigation are not alerted that they are being targeted.
Don’t fall for this old scam. If someone approaches you about
an investigation and says that a bank official will be contacting
you about how you can help, tell them to hit the road. Then
call the police to report it and give a description of the person
who approached you.
The Doctored ATM
To perpetrate this scam, the thieves install wireless equip-
ment on legitimate ATMs to steal ATM card and PIN numbers.
The attachment fits over the existing card slot and looks like
the original slot. This is used to read the card and capture the
ATM card number. A camera is placed in the bottom deposit
envelope holder and used to capture the keystrokes of your
PIN. The thieves usually install several of these “doctored
ATMs” in one area. 
To capture the information, the thieves sit in a car nearby and
receive the wireless transmissions for the doctored ATMs. The
best time to capture ATM card numbers and PIN numbers is
on weekends and holidays. Armed with the information, the
thieves proceed to withdraw thousands of dollars from the
accounts. 
Chapter 15: Ten Common Scams and How to Avoid Them 171

To protect yourself from this type of scam, you should be
weary of using ATM machine that seem out of the ordinary.
For example, the card slot holder has cracks around the edges
where the holder is affixed to the machine. If you see unusual
instructions on the ATM screen, such as asking you to enter
your PIN three times, be on guard. If the holder for the deposit
envelopes on either side of the machine is located where a
camera would have a clear shot at the keypad, cover the key-
pad when you type in your PIN by placing either your right 
or left hand over the keypad as you type in your PIN with the
other hand. You should be able to shield the screen and still
see what you are typing.
Phone Fraud
Here’s how this one works: You receive a call from a gentleman
or lady, and he or she tells you that they are with the fraud
division of your credit card company and are investigating
fraudulent charges on your credit card. They tell you that the
charges that are fraudulent come from a company that sells
computer hardware that has been involved in a lot of fraudu-
lent charges. They mention the name of the company and you
tell them you never heard of them and have never ordered
anything from them. In order to help them, they need to verify
your card number, your full name as it appears on the card,
and the expiration date of the card.
Do not give your credit card number to someone who has
called you. Tell them you will call the credit card company
yourself. After you tell them that, hang up the phone. Then
call the number on your credit card statement and inquire
about the investigation. Don’t ask the caller for a callback
number. 
Another phone fraud is the call forwarding scam. The scam
works like this: Someone calls claiming to be a bank employee
and states that they are investigating why correspondence
from the bank has supposedly been returned to the bank. 
The caller then asks a series of leading questions to get you 
to give them the name of your bank, credit card, and account
numbers. Next, the thief impersonates you and contacts your
phone service provider to verify that your phone line has call
forwarding. Now the thief poses as a telephone company
Part V: The Part of Tens 
172

employee and instructs you to leave the phone off the hook 
or not to answer it for an hour so system maintenance can be
performed. 
Armed with all this information and the fact that you are not
answering your phone or have it off the hook, the thief dials
codes that forward your calls to a number controlled by him
or her. 
Next the thief uses the account information you provided 
earlier to use Western Union to transfer money out of your
account. He or she also makes fraudulent charges on your
credit card. 
Because your calls are forwarded to the thief, he or she
receives all the verification calls, and you are unaware of what
is happening. Using this scam, a thief can steal thousands of
dollars from you in less than an hour.
Don’t give out personal information to strangers on the phone,
and you will not fall victim to this scam.
Card Verification
Card verification scams are usually done by phone or e-mail.
The person calling or writing says that they need to verify your
credit card information for your account at some online mer-
chant or pay service. They tell you that the server containing
the credit card numbers has been hacked into and all the data
on the credit card accounts has been lost, or they tell you that
they are verifying your information to make sure that it is cur-
rent. The caveat is that if you don’t provide the information,
they will cancel your account. 
If the scam is done by e-mail, the URL provided links you to a
site set up by the thieves and when you enter the information
to “verify” your credit card number, name, and expiration date,
they capture the information on their server. Then you know
what happens: Your card is used to make fraudulent charges.
When the scam is done by phone, the thief writes down all 
the information needed to use your credit card for fraudulent
purposes.
Chapter 15: Ten Common Scams and How to Avoid Them 173

To avoid this scam, don’t give the thieves the information
either on the phone or online.
You Won the Lottery!
Here’s how this scam works: You receive a letter, fax, or e-mail
claiming that you have won a large sum in an overseas lottery
game. You probably didn’t know you entered the lottery. The
letter says that the lottery commission for whatever country’s
lotto have tried unsuccessfully to contact you about your wind-
fall. In order to collect your winnings, you need to provide the
lotto commission with your bank account information so that
they can wire transfer the money to your account. Some of
these scams have a form sent with the letter that asks for 
personal information, such as your full name (including your
middle name), DOB, address, your occupation, marital status,
and telephone number. Some of the forms also ask for next of
kin information, including first and last name, address, tele-
phone number, and occupation. What a great way to solicit
more victims. Then there is a bank transfer section that asks
for your banks’ name, address, account numbers, routing
number, and telephone number.
Once you provide the information to the lotto commission, the
only one who wins is the person who sent the letter. Imagine
that! To avoid becoming a victim don’t give them the informa-
tion. Just discard the letter, e-mail, or fax.
These letter scams have been successful because they play to
the greed aspect of human nature. Remember that there is no
such thing as free money.
Bogus Charities
You are watching TV, and the phone rings. You answer, and the
person on the other end says that he or she is from a charita-
ble group soliciting donations. Be careful. This has been used
as a ploy to get your credit card number and expiration date,
or a personal check. 
Part V: The Part of Tens 
174

Legitimate charities exist who use telephone solicitation for
donations. You can give to your favorite charity and still pro-
tect yourself. There are other ways to find out how to make a
donation other than doing it over the phone. You can go online
and look up the charity. The Web site will have all the contact
information to make a donation. Or you can open the Yellow
Pages in your area and look up the address and phone number
of your favorite charity.
Another variation on this theme is the disaster relief donation
scam. This scam occurred right after the 9/11/01 tragedy. The
thieves set up a bogus Web site and then sent a spam e-mail
soliciting $25 credit card donations to help the victims of 9/11
families. The e-mail had a link to the thief’s Web site, and the
mail recipient clicked on the link to enter the site to make a
donation. The site asked of course for your credit card number,
full name, and expiration date of the card. Also, the site asked
for your SSN under the guise that you can then claim the dona-
tion on your income tax as a deduction. 
Those people who made the donation found themselves 
victims of identity theft. The perpetrators established new
addresses and opened new accounts using the names of the
people who went to the site.
Other people were pressured into making on the spot dona-
tions over the phone using the same tactics as the Web site
thieves used to get personal information.
Don’t stop donating to charities — just don’t give out your
personal information to strangers on the telephone. In most
states, the charitable organizations must be registered with
the state attorney general, so check whether the charity is
legitimate before you donate.
Bogus Invoices
This scam involves phony invoices made to look like the real
thing. I have been getting a number of these bogus invoices 
in my e-mail account recently. This may be the new trend to
garner personal information from you and me. I have also
Chapter 15: Ten Common Scams and How to Avoid Them 175

received some bogus invoices via U.S. mail. One of the telltale
signs of a bogus invoice is the lack of a phone number for an
alternative contact method.
In order to comply with U.S. Postal regulations, these solicita-
tions are supposed to have the following wording on them.
The following disclaimer is easy to spot in the e-mails, but I
have not always seen the disclaimer.
“THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE
UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED
ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS OFFER.”
The wording is supposed to be near the top of the invoice in
capital letters in bold type that is at least as large as the letters
on the solicitation. Often times the disclaimer is overlooked
or misunderstood. The idea is to get you to pay for something
you didn’t order. Sometimes the scam is used to solicit credit
card information. 
Don’t respond to invoices that don’t have phone numbers on
them. If you didn’t order what is stated in the invoice, simply
ignore it.
Phony Brokerage Firms
In the phony brokerage firm scam, the thieves set up a Web
site using the name of an actual brokerage firm, but they use a
different address. Then they craft and send a spam e-mail. The
e-mail usually trumpets upcoming “hot” stock to entice you
into visiting their Web site. On the site, you provide the usual
personal information, credit card number, and other personal
information to purchase the “stock.” At the time of this writing
it is not clear whether the scam is being perpetrated to garner
personal information to be used in further frauds in identity
theft or whether they are collecting money for phony stocks. 
In any event, don’t purchase stocks from unsolicited e-mails.
It is probably just a ruse to get your personal information. If
you are interested in buying stock, contact one of the broker-
age firms near you and set up a face-to-face meeting in their
office.

Temporary Suspension 
of Your Account
The temporary suspension of your account scam is set up
either in an e-mail or telephone call. The thieves use the scare
tactic that your bank account (or online payment or online auc-
tion account) has been suspended. The e-mail or phone caller
claims that the bank is undertaking a review of all its accounts
to eliminate waste and fraud. You are then requested to visit
the “company’s” Web site to provide the information necessary
for them to do a review of your account and to make sure the
information they have is correct. The information they ask 
for is the usual: full name, account number, ATM/debit card
number, and PIN. The e-mail or phone caller goes on to say
that if you don’t provide the information, your account will 
be permanently canceled.
You know what happens next! You become the victim of iden-
tity theft. So when in doubt, don’t provide the information.
Contact your bank instead.
