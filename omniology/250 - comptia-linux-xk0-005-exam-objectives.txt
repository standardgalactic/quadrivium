CompTIA Linux+ Certification Exam Objectives 1.0 (Exam Number: XK0-005)
Candidates are encouraged to use this document help prepare for the CompTIA 
Linux+ XK0-005 certification exam. The CompTIA Linux+ certification exam will verify 
the successful candidate has the knowledge and skills required configure, manage, 
operate, and troubleshoot Linux on-premises and cloud-based server environments, 
while using security best practices, scripting, containerization, and automation.
This is equivalent to at least 12 months of hands-on experience working with Linux servers 
in a junior Linux support engineer or junior cloud/DevOps support engineer job role.
These content examples are meant to clarify the test objectives and should not be 
construed as a comprehensive listing of all the content of this examination. 
EXAM ACCREDITATION 
The CompTIA Linux+ exam is accredited by ANSI to show compliance with the ISO 17024 
standard and, as such, undergoes regular reviews and updates to the exam objectives.
EXAM DEVELOPMENT
CompTIA exams result from subject-matter expert workshops and industry-wide survey 
results regarding the skills and knowledge required of an entry-level IT professional.
