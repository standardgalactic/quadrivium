Callaghan, who kept us supplied with food, drink, and encouragement while 
we slaved over our laptops every evening and weekend writing this book.

Acknowledgments
We thank our colleagues across many organizations over the years who have assisted us in 
our attempts to put best practices into practice. In particular, Liz Gallacher would like to 
thank Dave Cousin, who encouraged her to follow her instincts and gave her the opportu-
nity to do just that in two major projects. 
We thank the teachers who shared their passion for service management during our 
ITIL V2 Manager courses all those years ago: Ben Weston, Andrew Jacobs, and Mark 
Haddad, who taught Helen, and Dave Wheeldon and Lloyd Robinson, who taught Liz. Our 
commitment to focusing our careers in IT service management can be traced back to those 
few intense weeks.
We thank all the students we have taught for sharing their experiences with us and the 
clients who have had faith in us and our ability to put theory into practice. Our under-
standing of service management grows and develops with every organization we work with.
We thank all the ITIL trainers, wherever they are, spreading the service management 
message every week of the year. 
We thank Jane Holmes and Richard Webber for checking the content of this book and 
for the helpful suggestions they made.

About the Authors
Liz Gallacher is a service management consultant and trainer with 25 years of practical 
experience. She placed in the top 5 percent of candidates in the ITIL Manager certiﬁ cate 
and was invited to join the ISEB V2 Managers Certiﬁ cate Examiners panel. She holds the 
ITIL Expert certiﬁ cation and is a certiﬁ ed ISO/IEC 20000 consultant.
Liz provides consultancy and training on all aspects of IT service management, focusing 
on the ITIL framework and the ISO/IEC2000 standard. She has designed and implemented 
improvement initiatives covering many areas of service management for a variety of orga-
nizations, large and small. Her experience over the past 25 years has been a mixture of 
consultancy, training, and implementation, including setting up service desks for many large 
organizations, working with clients to design their service management processes, and eval-
uating and implementing service management toolsets that met their requirements. She also 
advises organizations seeking certiﬁ cation against the ISO/IEC 20000 standard, performing 
gap analyses, advising and mentoring improvement plans, and so on.
Liz has worked for global organizations, central and local government departments, 
the U.K. National Health Service, and many others. She has set up service management 
 organizations from scratch. In each case, she designed and documented the processes, 
 procured the service management tool set, recommended the organizational structure, 
drafted job descriptions, and recruited several hundred staff over a number of projects. 
She then trained the staff and devised appropriate marketing campaigns to publicize the 
new service desks to the customer base.
She has implemented service improvement initiatives for several clients, combining 
improvements in processes and tools with customer awareness coaching for IT staff. For a 
national railway infrastructure organization, she implemented a 24×7×365 service desk to 
replace 18 other sources of support, delivering a service that was assessed by the Gartner 
and Maven organizations to be “world class” and “highly efﬁ cient.”
She has provided consultancy on many aspects of service management, including  service-
level management, change management, request fulﬁ llment, and incident and problem 
 management. She has compiled detailed service catalogs.
For many clients, Liz has gathered tool set requirements, evaluated products, and recom-
mended the purchase of products that matched the requirement. She has also speciﬁ ed the 
tool conﬁ guration to support the processes, delivered the required reporting, and overseen 
the implementation. She has also delivered user training.
Liz has developed and delivered bespoke training for clients covering particular aspects 
of service management. She has also coauthored classroom and distance-learning courses 
covering the ITIL framework. She delivers ITIL foundation and intermediate training and 
consultancy worldwide, with courses this year in India, China, Australia, New Zealand, 
the Philippines, Germany, and South Africa, as well as the United Kingdom. With Helen 
Morris, she has devised an innovative blended approach to mentoring and supporting 
 clients remotely.

About the Authors 
vii
Helen Morris provides quality training and consultancy to organizations, assisting with 
delivery of IT service management. She specializes in providing cultural change support 
and training to organizations to enable the full exploitation of the beneﬁ ts from implement-
ing service management best practices.
Helen has 20+ years of experience in service management including operational manage-
ment of service desks, technical support teams, and service-level management. She holds 
the ITIL Expert qualiﬁ cation and has delivered service management training for many 
years. She now delivers ITIL foundation and intermediate training in the United Kingdom, 
Europe, and the United States. She has coauthored and recorded distance-learning courses 
covering the ITIL framework. Helen is also a certiﬁ ed ISO/IEC 20000 consultant.
Helen is an experienced trainer, consultant, and service delivery manager focused on 
providing customer satisfaction and business beneﬁ ts. Many of her assignments involve an 
initial assessment against best practices, recommendations for improvement, and target set-
ting. She leads programs to achieve signiﬁ cant improvements in customer satisfaction, qual-
ity of service, reduced costs, and better control.
Helen has presented at a number of international service management conferences, and 
she blogs regularly on service management topics. With Liz Gallacher, she has devised a 
unique approach to mentoring, providing assistance and resources to clients while encourag-
ing them to develop the skills they need without the need for expensive on-site consultancy.
As an experienced consultant, Helen has led a number of successful service management 
improvement programs, working with organizations to develop their service management 
strategy and being a key player in the implementation of the strategy within the organiza-
tions. She has delivered strategic improvements in customer satisfaction, service delivery, 
and regulatory standards.
Helen managed the support environment for a Microsoft partner and supported the 
launch of Windows 95, implementing an improvement initiative to achieve the required 
customer satisfaction targets. Throughout this period, Helen was also leading a team to 
achieve and maintain successful ISO 9001 compliance within the division. This included 
extensive process reengineering in the support division to ensure efﬁ cient and effective pro-
cess to support the customer satisfaction targets.
An assignment with a blue-chip telecommunications company allowed Helen to imple-
ment strategies for introducing best practices into the service delivery management team 
as the lead for the rollout of ITIL. This formed part of the company initiative to achieve 
BS15000 (a precursor to ISO 20000), in which Helen was a key player, specializing in inci-
dent and problem management.
Many of Helen’s assignments have involved assessing and restructuring the support envi-
ronment to provide improvements in cost efﬁ ciency and customer satisfaction. This has often 
required working across a broad spectrum of the business to achieve an agreed-on approach 
within the organization. Helen was the lead consultant in delivering the service improvement 
program for an outsource provider; she provided support services and networks for a large 
number of blue-chip and ﬁ nancial institutions, delivered by a service support function of 
more than 120 personnel. Helen achieved and maintained an improvement in service levels 
from 80 percent to 95 percent (target) within three months across all service areas.

Introduction
IT service management is an increasingly important area of study for all IT profes-
sionals. IT managers are realizing that, whatever the technology in use, the requirements 
to manage that technology efﬁ ciently and effectively and to deliver services that are 
aligned to the business requirement have never been more important.
The internationally recognized ITIL framework is the best-known approach to IT ser-
vice management; in the ﬁ rst three months of 2011, 54,500 people took the ITIL founda-
tion exam worldwide, with no sign of demand reducing. For most IT staff members, the 
certiﬁ cation is now regarded as an essential addition to their resumes, with many job ads 
specifying the foundation qualiﬁ cation as a mandatory requirement. The popularity of 
ITIL has spread around the world, with an enthusiastic take-up in India, the Middle East, 
and China in particular.
For those IT staff members who are funding their own training, the costs and 
time required to attend a classroom course has been unattainable. Distance learning 
does not suit everyone. For those who do attend classes, it is a common comment that 
there is too much material to cover in the time allowed. By providing the ITIL course 
in a book format, these difﬁ culties have been overcome; the book is an economical 
alternative to a course and can be studied at the student’s own pace. The many practice 
questions help reinforce understanding. It can be used by itself or as an addition to 
attending a course.
ITIL Foundation Exam Study Guide provides foundation-level training for IT staff 
and customers of IT to gain an understanding of the ITIL terminology. Readers will gain 
knowledge of the ITIL service lifecycles and the ITIL processes, roles, and functions. They 
will also gain an understanding of how the service lifecycle provides effective and efﬁ -
cient IT services that are aligned to, and underpin, business processes. The book covers 
the full syllabus, preparing students to take the foundation exam at a convenient local 
test center.
There are no prerequisites, although it is expected that readers will have worked in an IT 
department or are studying IT at university level.
The book covers each area of the ITIL syllabus, examining each of the ﬁ ve areas of the 
service lifecycle, explaining concepts, highlighting terms that need to be understood for 
the exam, and providing real-life examples. These ﬁ ve stages include the following:
Introduction to IT Service Management and Service Strategy The design, development, 
and implementation of service management as a strategic asset to align with business 
processes
Service Design The design and development of service and service management 
processes
Service Transition The building, testing, authorizing, documenting, and implementation 
of new and changed services into operation

xviii 
Introduction
Service Operation The day-to-day support and management of live services
Continual Service Improvement Creating and maintaining value for customers 
through monitoring and improving services, processes, and technology throughout 
the lifecycle

This chapter introduces the concept of service management 
and explores a number of key areas that enable the 
management of services in an operational environment. 
It also introduces the ITIL framework, which is a source of best practices in service 
management. 
The ITIL framework consists of ﬁ ve publications, which detail the content of the service 
lifecycle. Each publication covers a lifecycle stage, and each lifecycle stage shows how pro-
cesses are used to improve service management in an organization. In this chapter, you will 
explore the basic concepts of the ITIL framework and learn about the terminology used 
throughout the lifecycle.
This chapter contains a number of key terms that will be important for your under-
standing of the framework and that also frequently occur in examination questions.
Best-Practice Approaches and ITIL
ITIL is recognized worldwide as a best-practice approach for delivering IT services and IT 
service management. It focuses on the processes, functions, and capabilities required to 
support IT services in business.
Organizations need to remain competitive in the marketplace and can compare 
themselves to peers to identify where they can gain a competitive advantage. Commonly, 
they look to industry best practices to ensure they are using the best available methods 
and techniques to deliver a service. A number of best-practice approaches to IT are 
available, and organizations can use them as a benchmark to ensure that they are delivering 
IT services efﬁ ciently. It is important to recognize that these approaches must enable IT 
service providers to meet the needs of the customer, while remaining cost-effective and 
within the customer’s budget.
As shown in Figure 1.1, there are many sources of service management best practices. 

Best-Practice Approaches and ITIL 
3
The sources of service management best practices include the following:
■ 
Proprietary knowledge/internal experience
■ 
This is often deeply embedded in an organization. Although this is valuable, it is 
very difﬁ cult to share with another organization. It is also often undocumented, 
held as knowledge by the individual.
■ 
Proprietary knowledge is speciﬁ c to the organization and can be so customized as 
to be ineffective in another organization, unless it requires the same conditions.
■ 
The sharing of this knowledge may be constrained by ownership, and it may be 
subject to legal or ﬁ nancial negotiations.
■ 
Standards/industry practices 
■ 
This is preferable to organizations when compared to proprietary knowledge. 
Standards and commonly used industry practices are captured, documented, and 
made available publicly.
■ 
Standards also have the advantage of being veriﬁ ed in a variety of situations and 
environments, rather than a single organization’s experience. The standards are 
vetted and reviewed by a wide range of partners, competitors, and suppliers.
■ 
Commonly used standards include the following: ITIL, Lean, Six Sigma, COBIT, 
CMMI, Prince2, PMBOK, ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 20000, and ISO/IEC 27001.

Training and education/academic research
■ 
Information and education on publicly available standards and research let orga-
nizations educate their staff in a consistent manner. It is easier for organizations to 
acquire knowledge through the marketplace, because levels of skill and qualiﬁ ca-
tion can be standardized.
Using standards and publicly available knowledge enables organizations to build on 
their proprietary knowledge and follow best practices for their organizational requirements 
in service management.
These standards have to be ﬁ ltered through the constraints that affect all organizations, 
such as regulatory requirements, compliance, and ﬁ nancial concerns.
Why Is ITIL So Successful?
For a while after its origins in the 1980s, ITIL was the best-kept secret in the IT sector; 
however, the framework has become the recognized approach for service management 
excellence.
The main reason for its widespread adoption is that it is based on a practical approach 
to service management, utilizing what works in real organizations. The guiding principle 
behind the framework is to ensure that all efforts have a common goal: to deliver IT ser-
vices that support the requirements of the business by delivering value to the organization.
This section explores the key factors for ITIL’s success:
Vendor Neutrality The ITIL framework is not based on a speciﬁ c technology platform or 
industry type. It is not tied to any speciﬁ c vendors; it is owned by the U.K. government and 
has no associations to any commercial proprietary practices or solutions. As a consequence, 
the guidance it provides for service management is applicable across any industry sector or 
enterprise. This allows its guidance to be globally adopted by any organization.
Nonprescriptive From the beginning of its development, ITIL has recommended the 
approach of “adopt and adapt” to the guidance it offers. The true beneﬁ t of its application 
is in the adaptation to meet the speciﬁ c requirements for value creation in an individual 
organization. The guidance contains time-tested, robust, and mature practices that can be 
utilized by any service organization. It is relevant to public and private sectors, internal and 
external service providers, and organizations of any size. It is not dependent on the techno-
logical environment, and it provides pragmatic guidance applicable and adaptable to any 
situation.
Best Practice ITIL delivers the accumulated knowledge and guidance from the best 
sources of service management practices across the world. 
The strength of the ITIL framework, and a key to its success, is that it describes prac-
tices that enable organizations to deliver beneﬁ ts, return on investment, and value on 
investment through a sustained approach. The following are some of the factors that moti-
vate organizations to adopt the framework:

Services, Customers, and Stakeholders 
5
■ 
Creation of value for customers through the services provided
■ 
The emphasis on integration with the business, ensuring that the business strategy and 
customer requirements are reﬂ ected in the service management strategy
■ 
The ability to measure, monitor, and optimize IT services and the performance of 
 service providers
■ 
Management of the investment for IT services and budgetary controls
■ 
Risk management in alignment with the business
■ 
Knowledge management across the service management enterprise
■ 
The delivery of services effectively and efﬁ ciently, through the management of the 
resources and capabilities required
■ 
The adoption of a standard approach to service management across the organization
■ 
A change of culture as part of the approach to service management, developing and 
maturing the processes to deliver effective IT services
■ 
Improvement in the interaction and relationship between the service provider and their 
customers
■ 
The ability to coordinate the delivery of goods and services and to be able to optimize 
and reduce costs
Services, Customers, and Stakeholders
To understand the service lifecycle, it is necessary to start with the concept of a service. 
The framework deﬁ nes a service thusly:
Services are a means of delivering value to customers, by facilitating the 
outcomes customers want to achieve, without the ownership of specific 
costs and risks.
Before exploring the concept further, it is important to ensure that you 
clearly understand this simple statement. Think of it in terms of an actual 
service, such as email. Email provides the ability to create a written 
 communication in an electronic format, which is a desirable outcome for 
a business. But the user of the email service does not want to understand 
or manage the complexity of the infrastructure that supports the email 
service (network, server, client and application software, user accounts, 
and so on). The customer recognizes that the service has a cost and that 
this cost covers the “hidden” elements of the provision, but the ownership 
of these costs and associated risks in delivery are managed by the service 
provider, not the customer. 

6 
Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
The services facilitate the desired outcomes by enhancing the performance of the tasks 
associated with the delivery of service, and reducing the effect of constraints, such as 
technology limitations, funding, or regulation. By enhancing performance and reducing 
constraint, the desired outcome is more likely to be achieved. This is applicable whether 
the service is enhancing the performance of a task required by the business or whether it is 
performing the task itself.
This is a recurring pattern in the delivery of a wide range of services. Understanding 
these patterns of service provision enables us to manage the delivery more effectively, in 
terms of complexity, cost, ﬂ exibility, and variety. Simply put, it means you can apply the 
same strategic approach to the management of a wide variety of services and make only 
minor adjustments to meet the speciﬁ c requirements of each business. This is the core of 
ITIL’s approach to service management.
ITIL deﬁ nes the term outcome thus:
The result of carrying out an activity, following a process, or delivering an 
IT service etc. The term is used to refer to intended results, as well as to 
actual results.
By focusing on the desired outcome from a customer perspective and managing services 
according to the delivery of the outcome, you are able to work closer with your organization, 
achieving IT and business integration, rather than IT and business alignment. It is only when 
you fully understand the required outcomes that you can deliver your services effectively.
ITIL deﬁ nes an IT service thusly:
A service provided by an IT service provider. An IT service is made up 
of a combination of information technology, people and processes. A 
customer-facing IT service directly supports the business processes of 
one or more customers and its service level targets should be defined in a 
service level agreement. Other IT services, called supporting services, are 
not directly used by the business but are required by the service provider 
to deliver customer-facing services.
Customer satisfaction with the services you provide is an important aspect of the 
 delivery. Satisfaction with a service will consist of a number of factors, including the cost 
and value of the service. Customers do not want to have accountability for or ownership of 
the associated costs and risks, but the costs and risks must still be managed. Service costs 
will be reﬂ ected in ﬁ nancial terms such as return on investment (ROI) and total cost of 
ownership (TCO). Customers will be exposed only to the overall costs of the service provi-
sion but will use this as part of the basis for judging the value of the service being provided 
and the outcomes that are achieved. 
Identifying Types of Service
Services can be grouped together to the value they provide for the customers. 
Core Services These are services that deliver the basic outcomes required by one or more 
customers. They are services that provide the value the customer wants and for which they 

Services, Customers, and Stakeholders 
7
are willing to pay. It is usually this set of core services that provides the capability for the 
business-critical functions to take place. An example that is often considered to be a core 
service is email. We will continue this example in the other service groups.
Enabling Services These are services that are needed to ensure that the core service can 
be delivered successfully. These services may not be immediately visible to the customer 
and may not even be perceived as services in their own right. But without them, the core 
services cannot be delivered. Using our email core service example, the supporting services 
would cover the infrastructure and network to enable the service to work effectively.
Enhancing Services These are additional services that enhance the core service, making 
it more attractive or appealing to the customer. They are not essential to the delivery of the 
core services but are extra factors that make the offerings more attractive to the customer. 
Using our core service email example, an enhancing service associated to the core might be 
the ability to access the email service remotely, through a web-based portal or the use of 
smart phone access to email. It is not an essential element of the core service functionality 
but adds something that provides value and customer satisfaction.
Understanding the Customer, Internal and External
Although it may not be relevant in your particular organization, for a great percentage 
of businesses, there are two types of customers. ITIL differentiates between internal and 
external customers, because there is a difference between those customers who work within 
the same organization and those working for a separate organization.
Internal Customers These are people who work in the same organization as the service 
provider. For example, the HR department is an internal customer of the IT department 
because it uses IT services. It is likely that the service provider is funded through the inter-
nal accounting system, rather than as a revenue stream, although obviously this is entirely 
dependent on the ﬁ nancial strategy within the organization. Funding internally can some-
times cause challenges in managing the budget for IT services, because it may be hard to 
demonstrate the direct beneﬁ t to the business in terms of revenue.
External Customers These are people who are not employed by the organization or 
are employed by a separate legal entity. External customers pay for services under agree-
ment through a legally binding contract. In this situation, funding is direct, rather than 
through the internal accounting systems, and is managed through the speciﬁ ed contractual 
obligations.
There is often a requirement for internal IT service providers to deal directly with 
 external customers through online services that are part of a standard offering. Organi-
zations need to ensure that the strategies they adopt for IT service provision reﬂ ect these 
requirements and understand the implications for funding and commitment to customers.
Whatever the customer relationship, either internal or external, it is important to ensure 
that the service is delivered according to the agreed service deﬁ nition, under the service 
level agreements in place.

Differentiating Between Internal and External Services
Just as there are internal and external customers, ITIL identiﬁ es internal and external 
 services, as Figure 1.2 illustrates.

Internal services are delivered between departments or business units within the same 
organization. As you would expect, external services are those delivered to an external 
customer.
As you can see in Figure 1.2, some services are provided internally, and others exter-
nally, but all are being provided by the same service provider.

Services, Customers, and Stakeholders

There are sound reasons for differentiating between these two types of service. Remem-
ber, the deﬁ nition of service includes the phrase “facilitating outcomes customers want 
to achieve.” You need to be able to differentiate between services that support an internal 
activity and those that deliver business outcomes. It is often the case that an internal service 
needs to be linked to an external service before you can fully appreciate its contribution 
to a business outcome. This will have an impact on the funding and management of the 
services.
As we have identiﬁ ed, an IT service is a service that is provided to one or more cus-
tomers by an IT service provider. Services are made up of the combination of technology, 
people, and processes and are based on the use of information technology and support the 
customer’s business processes.
Table 1.1 shows the differentiation between internal and external services via an extract 
in the ITIL Service Strategy publication (speciﬁ cally, Table 3.4, “Types of IT Service”).

Type of service
Definition
Description
Supporting service, 
sometimes called 
an infrastructure 
 service, although 
they are often 
broader than just 
infrastructure
A service that is not 
directly used by the busi-
ness, but is required by 
the IT service provider so 
they can provide other IT 
services – for example, 
directory services, naming 
services, the network or 
communication services.
Supporting services are defined to allow 
IT teams to identify the interdependen-
cies between IT components. They will 
also show how these components are 
used to deliver internal and external 
customer-facing services.
Supporting services enable IT processes 
and services, but are not directly visible 
to the customer.
Some IT teams view recipients of sup-
porting services as ‘customers’. Although 
this promotes good service quality, it 
is also misleading. Supporting services 
only exist to be  combined with other 
 supporting services to produce  customer-
facing services. If they cannot, they are 
of no value and their existence should be 
questioned.
There can be no service level 
 agreements for supporting services 
as they are all internal to the same 
 department. Instead, the performance of 
supporting services should be managed 
using operational level agreements.

Description
It should be noted that the  diagram only 
refers to services originating inside the 
organization. In some cases supporting 
services are sourced from outside the 
organization. In these cases they are 
managed in the same way as other sup-
porting services, but using underpinning 
contracts rather than operational level 
agreements.
Internal customer-
facing service
An IT service that directly 
supports a business 
process managed by 
another business unit – 
for example, sales report-
ing service, enterprise 
resource management.
An internal customer-facing service is 
identified and defined by the business. 
If it cannot be perceived by the busi-
ness as a service, then it is probably a 
 supporting service.
Internal customer-facing services rely on 
an integrated set of supporting services, 
although these are often not seen or 
understood by the customer or user.
Internal customer-facing services are 
managed according to service level 
agreements.
External customer-
facing service
An IT service that is 
directly provided by IT to 
an external customer – for 
example, internet access 
at an airport.
An external customer-facing service 
is available to external customers and 
is offered to meet business objectives 
defined in the organization’s strategy.
An external customer-facing IT service is 
also a business  service in its own right, 
since it is used to conduct the busi-
ness of the organization with external 
 customers.
Depending on the strategy of the 
organization, the service is either 
provided free of charge (many govern-
ment agencies provide services to the 
public for no fee), or it is billed directly 
to the person or organization using 
the service. In other cases, the service 
may be provided free to the customer, 
but paid for by a third party, such as an 
advertiser or sponsor. These services 
are managed using a contract – even 
a simple online agreement constitutes 
a contract of sale and purchase with 
terms and conditions.

Services, Customers, and Stakeholders 
11
Who Are the Stakeholders in Service Management?
ITIL classiﬁ es stakeholders as those individuals or groups that have an interest in an 
organization, service, or project and are potentially interested or engaged in the activities, 
resources, targets, or deliverables from service management.
There may be many different stakeholders in a service provider organization, including 
the functions, groups, and teams that deliver a service. There are also other stakeholders 
external to the service provider organization; they include the following types:
Customers These are the individuals or groups that buy goods or services. They are 
responsible for agreeing on and deﬁ ning the targets in the service level agreements with the 
IT service provider. They are the people within the organization who have ﬁ nancial author-
ity over the services provided by the IT service provider and may be the key signatories for 
the service level agreement. 
As you have already seen in this section, customers may be internal to the organization or 
external, dependent on whether they work within the organization or outside of it. 
In organizations where the business model is to directly cross charge for IT services, it is 
easy to understand the concept of the customer. It becomes more complicated when the 
IT funding is managed through the accounting system and there is no direct connection 
between the IT services received and the cost for them. The definition of a customer implies 
that customers have financial authority over the agreements associated to the service. 
Often one of the most challenging elements of the process service level management 
is  identifying and working with the appropriate customers. Service level manage-
ment is  discussed in Chapter 5, “Service Level Management: Aligning IT with Business 
Requirements.”
Users This term is used to refer to those individuals or groups that use the service on a 
day-to-day basis. They are distinct from customers, because they have no overall authority 
over the service, and customers may not use the service directly.
A key challenge for service management is to ensure that the users are well informed about 
the items that concern them. An example is keeping users informed of the progress of inci-
dents. Another challenge is to ensure that users are adequately informed of the agreements 
that have been made in service level management. This can be achieved by using the service 
catalog, which provides information about the operational services. This will be discussed 
in Chapter 6, “The Other Service Design Processes.” 
Suppliers Suppliers are classed as third parties who have responsibility for the supply of 
goods or services that are required to deliver IT services. There are many examples of sup-
pliers, such as hardware or software vendors, network providers, and so on.
The engagement of suppliers is now a critical part of most IT service providers organiza-
tions, making sure that they perform according to the speciﬁ cation of the contract. This is 
managed through the supplier management process, which will be discussed in Chapter 6, 
“The Other Service Design Processes.”

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
Understanding the Concepts 
of Service Management and IT 
Service Management
This section explores the key concepts of service management and IT service management.
Service Management
In today’s business environment, IT has become considered a “utility” for a successful 
organization; in much the same way as you expect water to ﬂ ow from a tap, your users expect 
their IT services to “ﬂ ow” from your screens and devices. The technology has now improved 
to the point where this expectation is not only realistic but also achievable. The management 
of the technology to deliver the service is crucial to the success of your organization’s required 
business outcomes. But the technology is not the sole element that makes up the services, 
which is why service management is more than technology management.
ITIL provides this deﬁ nition for the concept of service management:
A set of specialized organizational capabilities for providing value to 
customers in the form of services.
This is the deﬁ nition provided for a service provider:
An organization supplying services to one or more internal or external 
customers.
The organization of the resources and capabilities and their use in delivering valuable ser-
vices is the core of service management. Resources and capabilities are important concepts in 
the way service management delivers value to customers. They are fully deﬁ ned in Chapter 2,  
“Understanding Service Strategy.” An IT service provider must understand the needs and 
requirements of the business and meet them in a cost-effective and efﬁ cient  manner through 
the management of the resources and capabilities. The more mature the service management 
capability and organization, the greater the ability to deliver high-quality services.
Service management also provides a professional approach through the use of a wide 
body of knowledge, experience, and skills captured from a global community of organiza-
tions and individuals in all industry sectors. Within this there are formal schemes available 
for the education and training of staff so that organizations wanting to adopt this approach 
are able to beneﬁ t from industry-wide best practices.
The concept of service management did not originate with IT but with traditional 
service businesses, such as banks, hotels, and airlines. As IT organizations have adopted 
a service-oriented approach to the management of IT infrastructure, applications, and 
processes, the practice of service management has grown. Increasingly, the support for 
business operations and the solutions to business problems are delivered in the form of 
services. As outsourcing and shared service solutions have increased in popularity with 

Understanding the Concepts of Service Management and IT Service Management 
13
organizations, so have the number of IT service provider organizations, including internal 
IT service providers. This has brought new challenges in the management of services across 
a broad range of providers but has improved the best practices applied through service 
management. 
IT Service Management
Now let’s consider the role that IT has in service management, by looking at the deﬁ nition 
for IT service management (ITSM) and IT service provider.
IT service management (ITSM): The implementation and management 
of quality IT services that meet the needs of the business. IT service 
management is performed by IT service providers through an appropriate 
mix of people, process and information technology.
IT service provider: A service provider that provides IT services to 
internal or external customers.
Every IT department should consider itself an IT service provider and adopt the 
 principles and practices of service management to deliver IT services.
ITSM should be carried out efﬁ ciently and effectively, managing IT provision by 
 understanding the business perspective of the value that IT brings.
This requires a good relationship between the IT service provider and its customers, 
achievable by the customer receiving the services it requires at an affordable cost and 
acceptable level of quality and performance. The IT service provider needs to work out 
how to provide services that achieve the balance of these three areas, while communicat-
ing effectively with the customer if there are any constraints that may prevent successful 
delivery. 
ITSM recommends that this relationship and the service requirements of business need, 
cost, and performance are documented in a service level agreement (SLA). The SLA should 
describe the service, the targets for performance, and the responsibilities of the customer 
and the IT service provider. An agreement may cover many IT services or customers. We 
will cover the details of service level agreements in Chapter 5. 
IT Service Provider Types
ITIL suggests that there are three main types of service provider. The different types 
will share most aspects of service management, but other aspects such as the contracts, 
revenue, and strategy, as well as the customer types, will vary and take on different 
meanings according to the service provider type. This is how ITIL deﬁ nes the three 
provider types:
Type I: Internal Service Provider The internal service provider is located within the busi-
ness unit it supports. There may be several Type I service providers within a single organi-
zation. An example of this is the support offered to the individual faculties of a university 
or within an organization with multiple sites with local support teams.

14 
Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
Type II: Shared Services Unit This is an internal service provider that provides shared IT 
services to more than one business unit. An example of this is the centralized IT depart-
ment for a large multidivisional organization.
Type III: External Service Provider This type of provider provides IT services to external 
customers. An example of this is an outsourcing partner, who would deliver their services 
to customers outside of the provider organization.
You will often ﬁ nd that ITSM concepts are described according to only one of these 
service provider types, and there may be an inference that only one service provider type 
exists in an organization.
Reality is much more complicated, and there may be a mix of provider types at work in 
your own organization. There is guidance in the ITIL Service Strategy core publication on 
how to manage these complex relationships. For your foundation course, we do not cover 
the details of this management, but it is covered in the next level of qualiﬁ cation, as part 
of the intermediate courses.
Understanding Processes and Functions
It is important to differentiate between processes and functions. This section explores the 
concepts of processes and functions, as well as the deﬁ nitions provided by the framework 
for each. 
Processes in the Service Lifecycle
ITIL provides deﬁ nes a process thusly:
A process is a structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific 
objective. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into 
defined outputs.
Processes are a vital component in the service management approach. The ITIL frame-
work is based on processes, because the mechanisms used to ensure services are delivered 
according to a controlled set of activities, enabling the delivery of a speciﬁ c outcome.
Within a process, we are able to deﬁ ne actions, dependencies, and sequence. A process 
that is well deﬁ ned and managed can improve productivity across the organization or 
 function, carrying out the activity identiﬁ ed as part of the process.
The Process Model
Figure 1.3 illustrates the process model. This is a key ﬁ gure in your understanding of the 
service lifecycle because each process you consider should follow this model. 

Understanding Processes and Functions 
15
In the process model you can see three distinct sections. The upper section of Figure 1.3 
shows the required controls for the process to take place.
A process is organized around a set of objectives, which drive the main outputs from the 
process. The objectives will include the process measurements (metrics) and other outputs, 
such as the required performance reports and process improvement actions. 
In the central section of Figure 1.3, you can see the input, output, and activities. The 
output produced by the process should meet the requirements as speciﬁ ed by the business 
objectives. The business objectives will set out the standard or “norm” that is required for 
the output. Once the output has been conﬁ rmed as achieving this requirement, the process 
can be declared as effective. It can then be repeated, measured, and therefore managed 
to achieve the desired outcomes. If the activities are carried out utilizing the minimum 
resources, we can also declare the process to be efﬁ cient.
The inputs to the process are the data or information that is used by the process, and 
this may, of course, be the output from another process.
There will be a trigger for the initiation of the process or an activity within the process. 
There are many different mechanisms that can act as triggers, such as the arrival of an

Process control

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
input or other event or an output from another process. This might be a failure report trig-
gering the event management or incident management process.
Within the process, it is possible to establish the roles, responsibilities, tools, and man-
agement controls that are required in order to deliver the outputs to the required norm. 
The process may also deﬁ ne other elements, such as any required activities, work instruc-
tions, standards, and policies that are required to ensure the process will be carried out 
successfully.
Once a process has been deﬁ ned and the inputs, outputs, and controls have been agreed 
on, it should be documented and controlled. The process can be repeated and managed 
once the controls are established, and metrics and measures can be incorporated into the 
controls. These measures and metrics will then be able to provide feedback and improve-
ment in the form of regular management reports.
Supporting the process are the enablers: the resources and capabilities. We will cover 
these enablers in Chapter 2, “Understanding Service Strategy,” as part of the key concepts 
covered by the service strategy lifecycle stage.
There are many examples of processes both in the IT environment and outside of IT. 
Consider something as simple as making a cake. The inputs are the ingredients, the 
activities are the method, and the output is, of course, the cake.
Decisions need to be made on the type of ingredients based on the required ‘outcome’ 
or how many slices of cake are required. It must also satisfy the stakeholders in terms of 
quality.
In order to bake the cake, the correct resources and capabilities must be employed: the 
right number of cooks with the correct equipment and with the right skills, for baking.
The trigger for the process is the need for the cake, perhaps a special occasion like a 
birthday.
When this is translated into the IT environment, remember all of these factors must be 
considered in order to deliver a successful process. 
Fixing a failed item of infrastructure requires the correct resources, capabilities, inputs 
and activities in order to deliver the required outcome.
Process Characteristics
Some common characteristics apply to all processes:
Measurability It is important to ensure that all processes can be measured in a relevant 
manner. Processes are based on the performance of activities to deliver a speciﬁ c output, so 
the measurement should be performance based.
Different perspectives for the activities will require different measurement. For example, 
managers will typically be more interested in the measurement of cost, quality, and other 
variables of the performance, while those engaged in carrying out the performance are 
likely to be more concerned with duration and productivity.
Specific Results Processes exist to deliver a speciﬁ c result, or else they should not be tak-
ing place. This result must be individually accountable and identiﬁ able for it to have any 
measurable worth or value.

Understanding Processes and Functions 
17
Customers/Stakeholders Every process should deliver its primary result for the beneﬁ t 
of a customer or stakeholder. The process should meet the expectation of the  recipient, 
regardless of whether they are an internal or external customer or IT or business 
stakeholder.
Responds to a Trigger It makes no difference if the process is repeated or continual; the 
actions should be traceable to a speciﬁ c trigger.
Organizing for Service Management
Obviously there is no single approach that can be adopted by all organizations for the 
structure of the service provider. The individual organization will have to tailor the struc-
ture and resources applied to service management according to constraints of cost, size, 
and needs of the business. However, there is a requirement to have a basic functional capa-
bility, no matter what size or other organizational constraints you have.
Functions
A function is deﬁ ned by ITIL as a team or group of people and the other resources or tools 
that are used to carry out a process or process activities.
Commonly, in larger organizations, functions are broken down and carried out 
by individuals, groups, or teams with speciﬁ c or specialist skills appropriate to the 
tasks. An obvious example of this is the service desk. In smaller organizations, there 
may be fewer specialist groups or teams, and one team may carry out a number of 
functions; for example, the service desk is incorporated into the wider technical 
support team. 
It is important to deﬁ ne the roles and responsibilities required to carry out the processes 
and activities for each service lifecycle stage. Within the functions, you need to ensure you 
allocate the appropriate roles to individuals and that the structure of our teams, groups, or 
functions are managed to meet the service management requirements. 
ITIL provides a set of deﬁ ned roles:
Group A number of people who are performing similar activities. Groups are not nor-
mally viewed as formal structures but are used to ensure processes are carried out in the 
same way across a number of different areas. An example is a group of people engaged in 
problem or incident management.
Team A more formal structure for those working together with a common 
objective. Teams are very useful for collaboration and can be located in the same 
place or multiple locations. Examples are as diverse as a project team, incident resolution 
teams, or application development teams.
Departments Formal organizational structures within an organization. There is 
 usually a hierarchical structure that allows for the day-to-day management of staff in 
the department.
Division A number of departments that have been grouped together, often self-contained 
within an organization.

18 
Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
Chapter 10, “Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage,” explores 
the detail of the basic  functions that ITIL identiﬁ es as part of the service lifecycle. Brieﬂ y, 
these functions are as follows:
Service Desk Single point of contact for users into the IT service provider
Technical Management Expertise and management of the technological infrastructure
Application Management Expertise and management of the applications
IT Operations Management Day-to-day management of the infrastructure and 
 applications, including operation control and facilities management
These functions are described in the Service Operation core publication, 
but all the service lifecycle stages make use of them.
Service Automation 
Now that we’ve covered the function as a group or team, we’ll cover the tools that can be 
applied to assist with service management.
Automation can be extremely beneﬁ cial to the delivery of services and improve the 
performance of processes and service assets. This can be applied in all areas, for example, 
management, organization, people, process, knowledge, and information. Applications 
are a means of automation in their own right, but even these can be enhanced 
by additional technology where they need to be shared across people and process 
assets. There has been such an increase in the capability of technologies (examples 
such as artiﬁ cial intelligence, machine learning, and the massive increase in rich media 
technology), which has increased the potential of software-based service tools to handle a 
wider variety of tasks.
Improving the automated capability of your service provision offers advantages in several 
areas:
Capacity Management Automation for capacity management enables a more rapid 
response to demand variations without human intervention and allows ease of management 
for a 24-hour service without an increase in stafﬁ ng costs.
Measurement Automation allows for a consistent measurement and identiﬁ cation of 
improvement, without the human variable. This can also show where the human element of 
knowledge, skills, and experience are providing beneﬁ ts.
Optimization More efﬁ cient optimization activities are often outside the human 
 capability for processing data and scheduling and routing.
Knowledge Capture System-driven knowledge management reduces the reliance on 
 individual knowledge and the difﬁ culties of sharing proprietary knowledge.

Understanding Processes and Functions 
19
Internal IT service providers often ﬁ nd it challenging to address the funding require-
ments for introducing suitable automation, but when applied appropriately, there should 
be beneﬁ ts. Reducing costs and risks by managing complexity in a consistent manner will 
improve the quality of service.
There are a number of areas throughout service management where automation can 
 provide signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t:
■ 
Design and modeling. Modeling tools can assist with projection and forecasting.
■ 
Service catalog. Implementing an automated service catalog can enable the capture of 
demand for services, by recording interactions from the business. 
■ 
Pattern recognition and analysis. Understanding patterns of business activity allows 
you to manage demand.
■ 
Classiﬁ cation, prioritization, and routing. Incident management can beneﬁ t from an 
automated approach based on the targets in service level agreements.
■ 
Detection and monitoring. Service quality and speed to restore service can be improved 
through automated tools for availability management.
■ 
Routine service requests can also be handled with some level of automation.
To ensure that automation fulﬁ lls the promises of beneﬁ t realization, it is necessary to 
do some preparation, or there may be more problems created than are solved. First  simplify 
the service processes prior to automation. This will help reduce the variations in the 
 process, which may impede successful automation. 
Simpliﬁ cation should ensure that you retain the outcome of the process; it is important 
to make sure that there are no necessary steps or information removed from the process 
during this activity.
Then you need to clarify the exact steps that are to be undertaken and automated. This 
includes inputs, dependencies, and interactions that are critical for the process to succeed. 
Once this has been established, the automation should be tested, and then if corrections are 
required, they can be applied.
Self-service technology can be extremely beneﬁ cial, but it does need to ensure that the 
users have the best possible experience, with the minimum requirement for interaction with 
the system. 
The only tasks and interactions that should be automated, or considered for automation, 
are those that have a recognizable recurring pattern and clear inputs, activities, resources, 
and outputs. 
By utilizing the data and information you capture from automation, you can perform 
service analysis to understand where enhancements can be achieved. In this way, you will 
be able to improve service quality.

Introducing the Service Lifecycle
In Figure 1.4 you can see the ITIL core, which represents the ﬁ ve ITIL service lifecycle 
 publications. The publications explore the processes and concepts for each lifecycle stage 
and how they interact with each other. Each lifecycle stage feeds into the others, with 
the stage of continual service improvement interacting with all of the others. Each of the 
 publications provides guidance on a particular aspect of service management and builds to 
form an integrated approach.

Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
The following are the ﬁ ve ITIL publications:
Service Strategy This covers the core of the lifecycle, setting the strategic approach for 
service management activities.
Service Design This provides guidance on the design and development of services accord-
ing to the requirements of the customer and the strategic approach.
Service Transition This provides guidance on the transition of new or changed services 
into the live environment, including the development and improvement of capabilities.
Service Operation This covers the management of the day-to-day delivery of services, 
including optimizing effectiveness and efﬁ ciency.

Summary 
21
Continual Service Improvement This provides guidance on the maintenance of value 
 creation and continual alignment to changing business needs.
We review each stage of the service lifecycle in the following chapters.
In each chapter, we explore aspects of the concepts and processes in each lifecycle stage:
■ 
Chapters 2 and 3: Service Strategy 
■ 
Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7: Service Design 
■ 
Chapters 8 and 9: Service Transition 
■ 
Chapters 10, 11, and 12: Service Operation
■ 
Chapter 13: Continual Service Improvement
Each chapter considers the capabilities that have a direct effect on the service provider’s 
performance and delivers structure to the service management enterprise by describing 
principles and processes for best practices. 
ITIL guidance can and should be adapted to support your speciﬁ c organizational 
 environment and strategy. The core publications are designed to provide a ﬂ exible approach 
that can be incorporated into any size or type of environment.
To assist with the adaptation and tailoring your approach to its use, the core is 
 supported by complementary publications. These are often speciﬁ c to a particular 
 industry sector and help with the provision of context when utilizing the generic  guidance. 
 Complementary publications are available from a variety of sources, including online 
resources and documentation.
Summary
This chapter set out the basic concepts that support service management. It provided an 
initial introduction to the ITIL terminology, the service lifecycle, and the process model. 
The remaining chapters will follow the service lifecycle and cover each of the stages of the 
lifecycle in turn. We will explore each in more detail and review the processes that make up 
the lifecycle stages.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
Exam Essentials
Understand that ITIL is a source of best practices. Best practices are available in a variety 
of sources, and ITIL is one of them. ITIL should be used in association with other 
best-practice approaches. Standards and industry practices should be used to complement 
proprietary knowledge to achieve best practices for your organizational requirements. 
Understand why ITIL is successful. The guidance that exists in the framework is based 
on a pragmatic approach of “adopt and adapt.” The key factors that make it successful 
are the nonprescriptive, vendor-neutral best practices that form the core service lifecycle 
publications.
Be able to recall the definitions of the key terms used in this chapter. The most important 
terms to remember are service, IT service, outcome, service management, IT service man-
agement, and IT service provider.
Understand that services may be grouped together. Services are grouped into core 
(business-critical services), enabling (services that support the delivery of core services), and 
enhancing (services that add value to the core services). 
Understand the different types of customer that ITIL defines. Internal customers are 
based in the same organization as the service provider. External customers are based 
outside of the organization of the service provider.
Be able to differentiate between the three service provider types. The three types are Type 
I (internal, within individual business units), Type II (shared, providing services shared 
across a number of business units), and Type III (external, providing services to external 
customers).
Understand the difference between the stakeholder types. The stakeholder types are 
customers who are individuals or groups that buy goods or services, users who use 
the services on a daily basis, and suppliers who are third parties who provide services that 
support or enable IT services. 
Be able to name the characteristics of processes. The characteristics of processes are that 
they are measureable, respond to a trigger, deliver a speciﬁ c result, and deliver to a 
customer or stakeholder.
Understand that automation is used to help improve efficiency and effectiveness. 
Although it is not explicitly referred to in every process or lifecycle stage, automation and 
the use of technology are key enablers for process enhancement and improvements.
Be able to name the core stages of the service lifecycle. The core lifecycle stages are 
service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation, and continual service 
improvement. 
Understand that the ITIL core publications are supported by complementary 
guidance. This guidance may be industry-speciﬁ c or provide context to the adoption of 
service management best practices.

This chapter explores the service strategy lifecycle stage. This 
is often referred to as the core of the service lifecycle, and 
it sets the strategic approach for the whole of the lifecycle, 
 leading into the operational environment.
The concepts that are explored in this chapter set the policies for the whole service 
 lifecycle and cover important aspects relating to how IT service management provides value 
to customers.
The service strategy lifecycle stage also includes the policies for governance and risk 
management that will apply to the whole service lifecycle.
Understanding the Service 
Strategy Stage
This section explores the service strategy lifecycle stage, covering the key concepts and 
 policies deﬁ ned as part of this stage of the lifecycle.
Purpose and Objectives of Service Strategy
Service strategy is the core stage of the service lifecycle. As its title suggests, the purpose is 
to deﬁ ne the strategic approach for service management across the whole lifecycle. 
This includes understanding the business perspective, position, future plans, and activity 
patterns that a  service provider needs in order to be able to deliver services that meet the 
business needs. By  understanding the business outcomes, we will be able to guide the focus 
for the whole  service lifecycle.
The objectives of service strategy include the following:
■ 
Providing an understanding of what strategy is
■ 
Identifying the services and the customers who use them
■ 
Understanding how to deﬁ ne value creation and delivery
■ 
Providing the means to identify opportunities to provide services and how to make the 
best of them 
■ 
Delivering a comprehensive and clear service provision model, in which we identify 
how the services will be funded and presented, to whom they will be delivered, and the 
purpose that they will serve

Understanding the Service Strategy Stage 
27
■ 
Understanding the organizational capability that will be required to deliver services 
according to the strategy
■ 
Coordinating and documenting the use of service assets for providing services and how 
they can be used, including optimizing their performance 
■ 
Deﬁ ning the processes and services that will deliver the strategic plans for IT service 
management and the level of investment that will be required
■ 
Understanding the levels of demand and how to establish a relationship between the 
service provider and the customer
The service strategy lifecycle stage provides guidance on understanding the most 
 important practices that need to be employed to deﬁ ne and carry out a service strategy in a 
service provider organization. 
Setting the Scope for Service Strategy
By deﬁ ning the generic principles and process for service management, you can apply them 
to ensure the consistent management of IT services.
The deﬁ nition is applicable for use by both internal and external service providers, and 
the Service Strategy publication provides guidance for both proﬁ t and nonproﬁ t service 
providers for the consistent management of services.
Two aspects are covered by the guidance in service strategy:
■ 
Deﬁ ning a strategy that gives a service provider guidance and recommendations about 
delivering services to meet a customer’s business outcomes
■ 
Deﬁ ning a strategy for managing those services
What Value Does Service Strategy Provide 
to the Business?
Adopting appropriate best practices as recommended in the ITIL publications can have 
 signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts. Implementing standard and consistent approaches for service strategy 
will provide the following:
■ 
The ability to link the activities carried out by the service provider to the business-
 critical outcomes that are required by internal or external customers. This will ensure 
that the service providers are seen to be contributing to the overall organizational 
value, not just being associated to cost generation. 
■ 
The ability to understand the type and levels of service that will support the customers 
and their success and then to organize them in order to deliver those services. This will 
be managed by a process of deﬁ ning strategies and services to ensure a repeatable, con-
sistent approach to delivering valuable services to stakeholders.
■ 
The ability to respond to business change, quickly and efﬁ ciently, improving the 
 competitive capability of the organization over time.

28 
Chapter 2 ■ Understanding Service Strategy
■ 
Guidance for creating and maintaining a service portfolio, which shows the overall capa-
bility of the service provision to deliver a positive return on investment for the business.
■ 
Support for the transparent communication between the service provider and the 
 customer, ensuring both parties have a consistent understanding of the requirements 
and their mode of delivery.
■ 
The ability to understand how to organize so that the required services can be 
 delivered in an effective and efﬁ cient manner.
Demonstrating the Value of Services
A simple view of the value of a service could be identiﬁ ed as the level to which the service 
meets the expectation of the customer. For example, a measure of this can be how much 
the customer is prepared to pay for the service, rather than the actual cost of the service or 
any speciﬁ c attribute of the service.
It is difﬁ cult to compare services and products, because, unlike products, services do 
not display much basic and essential value. A service demonstrates its value through what 
it enables a customer to do. The service provider does not determine the value of a service; 
the person who receives the service determines it. It will be based on their perception, 
what the service allows them to do, and what beneﬁ t they receive by using the service.
The following are the characteristics of value:
Value Is Defined by Customers A service provider may promote their service, but the 
 customer will make the ﬁ nal decision of its value.
Affordable Mix of Features Customers will choose the service that provides the best 
 combination of features, at a price that is reasonable.
Achievement of Objectives The service may not be valued in commercial terms; it may be 
measured against the capability to deliver against a speciﬁ c objective. Many organizations, 
particularly those in the public sector, or nonproﬁ t organizations, will not have a proﬁ t-
related measurement framework.
Value Changes Over Time and Circumstance It is important to recognize that what 
is valuable to a customer today may not be valuable in the future when business 
 circumstances or market situations have changed.
There is a basic calculation of value for most organizations; a service will be seen to be 
valuable when the value achieved is higher than the cost of purchasing the service.
To properly understand the value of a service, the IT service provider requires three 
pieces of information:
The Services IT Provided If IT is perceived only as managing the infrastructure 
 equipment (servers, networks, PCs, and so on), then the customer’s perception of value 
will be difﬁ cult to associate to business outcomes and activities. To determine the 
value of a service, a customer must be able to link it to something measurable in 
terms of value to them. Information captured as part of the service portfolio and service 
catalog will help the customer understand the speciﬁ c value provided by a service.

Understanding the Service Strategy Stage 
29
What the Services Achieved It is important for the customer to understand what they 
were able to do as a result of receiving the service and how important that was for them.
What the Services Cost (or the Price of the Service) The cost or the price for the service is 
a major piece of information that the service provider needs to deliver so that the customer 
can calculate the value. It is the service provider’s responsibility to make this available to the 
customer.
So, you now understand that the customer is key in deciding the value of a service. But what 
other factors inﬂ uence a customer’s understanding of value? See Figure 2.1 for an illustration.

F I G U R E 2 .1 Components of value
Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
ITIL identiﬁ es three areas that will be used by customers in their understanding of 
value: the business outcomes achieved, the customer’s preferences, and the customer’s 
 perception of what was delivered. The combination of these three elements will support the 
value statement. We covered the association of business outcomes with value already, so we 
will now cover the perceptions and preferences.
Perceptions are inﬂ uenced by many different factors, including the attributes of a service 
or the experience of the customer with other similar services or a competitor’s experiences. 
They may also be affected by the organization’s culture or image; perhaps they are seen as 
a risk-taking market leader or a solid and mature reliable company. These perceptions will 
affect the customer preferences.
Service providers need to understand these factors and provide customers with informa-
tion that helps inﬂ uence perceptions and respond to preferences.
Figure 2.2 illustrates how this translates to the economic value of a service as determined 
by the customer.

F I G U R E 2 . 2 How customers perceive value
Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
Figure 2.2 is based on research completed by Tom Nagle and Reed Holden in 2002. 
The starting point for customer perception in the diagram is the reference value. This could 
be based on a number of factors, for example, what the customer has heard about the ser-
vice or a previous experience with the service or a similar service. It is important for the 
service provider to understand this reference point, either through consultation with 
the customer or through appropriate research in the marketplace.
The positive difference shown in Figure 2.2 is based on the customer’s perception of the 
additional beneﬁ ts or gains delivered by the service provider.
The negative difference is the perception of the customer of what they would lose if they 
invested in the service; this could be quality issues or unexpected costs. Understanding the 
potential negatives, and then matching the features of the service to these, is a way of inﬂ u-
encing a customer’s perceptions.
The net difference shown in Figure 2.2 is the perception of the customer of the actual 
value of the service, once the negatives have been discounted. This could be better or worse 

Understanding Key Concepts of Service Strategy 
31
than the reference we began with, and it will be this ﬁ nal perception that will support the 
decision the customer makes about the service.
The economic value represents the overall value of the service, according to the 
 customer’s perception. It includes the “value calculation” shown in Figure 2.2 and is mea-
sured by the customer in terms of the ability of the service to meet the required outcomes.
It is important to recognize this strategic approach so you fulﬁ ll required outcomes for 
the business and not just deliver a set of services that you, as a service provider, believe the 
customer needs. This shift in strategic focus is one of the many cultural changes that ITIL pro-
motes to address the common lack of connection between businesses and their IT departments.
Understanding Key Concepts 
of Service Strategy
This section covers the importance of value creation. 
Utility and Warranty in Value Creation
As we discussed earlier, when considering the value of services, you should be concerned with 
delivering business outcomes and achieving business objectives. You can create this value by 
looking at two primary elements of a service: utility (ﬁ t for purpose) and warranty (ﬁ t for use). 
These work together to deliver the desired outcomes that allow customers to assess value.
Utility is what the service does, and warranty is how it is delivered, as you can see in 
Figure 2.3.

Chapter 2 ■ Understanding Service Strategy
Utility Utility is the functionality offered by a product or a service to meet a speciﬁ c cus-
tomer need. Often summarized as “what the service does,” this is where you understand if 
the service is able to meet the required outcomes. This is also commonly known as “ﬁ t for 
purpose.” This aspect of service value refers to tasks associated to achieving outcomes. 
Warranty Warranty provides the assurance that a product or service will meet the agreed 
requirements. This may be captured as part of a formal agreement, such as a  service level 
agreement or contract. It refers to the ability of the service to be available when needed, 
have sufﬁ cient capacity to meet the requirements, and be reliable in terms of both security 
and continuity. This is often summarized as “how the service is delivered” and commonly 
referred to as “ﬁ t for use.”
Value in Practice
Looking at any service-based industry can show an example of utility and warranty in a 
non-IT situation. For example, in a restaurant, no matter what the quality of the  service 
required (ﬁ ne dining or fast-food), there are basic requirements in terms of  premises, 
 furniture, kitchen, funding, food, staff, and so on. These are the utility aspects of 
 providing the service.
The warranty aspects depend on the type of service being provided. For a fast-food 
experience, you would expect the restaurant to be available 24 hours in the day, whereas 
a ﬁ ne-dining restaurant may have exclusive opening times. Fast-food is all about high 
turnover and high capacity, but once a ﬁ ne-dining restaurant is fully booked, they are 
OK with ensuring their customers are not rushed, because it adds to the exclusivity and 
appeal. Security and continuity are managed appropriately to the dining experience. 
Fast-food restaurants often have special counters that allow them to keep ﬁ nances away 
from the high volumes of customers, whereas a ﬁ ne-dining experience has an exclusiv-
ity approach with staff on hand to ensure security. Continuity of service for both types 
of establishment has to be managed according to the requirements of their customers. 
Fast-food is dependent on high turnover, ﬁ ne dining specializes in high quality, but both 
provide a valuable service. 
The different types of service (fast-food or ﬁ ne dining) have very different costs associ-
ated to them, but the customer has the ability to choose the most appropriate for their 
budget and their needs.
Assets, Resources, and Capabilities 
All processes need to have the appropriate resources and capabilities in order to be successful.
Assets Resources and capabilities are classed as assets of an organization. All interactions 
between the service provider and customer are based on the use of assets, both those of 
the service provider and the customer. Because many customers use the services provided 

Understanding Key Concepts of Service Strategy 
33
to deliver services or products to their own customers, customer assets from the service 
 provider perspective may be considered to be service assets by the customer.
However the assets are perceived, the performances of all assets are part of deﬁ ning the 
value of a service.
ITIL provides us with these deﬁ nitions for assets:
Asset: Any resource or capability.
Customer asset: Any resource or capability used by a customer to achieve 
a business outcome.
Service asset: Any resource or capability used by a service provider to 
deliver services to a customer.
There are two types of asset used by both service providers and 
customers: resources and capabilities. They are used to create value in the 
form of goods and services.
Resources Resources are the direct inputs for the production of services. These cover 
everything from money, infrastructure items, applications, people, and anything that could 
be used to assist in the delivery of a service. They are often considered to be assets of an 
organization, and many will be classiﬁ ed under capital expenditure as a physical asset.
Capabilities Capabilities are the assets that represent the organization’s ability to do 
something to achieve value, such as the ability to coordinate, control, and deploy resources 
in the form of a service. Typically these are knowledge or information based and include 
experience, which is embedded in the organization.

Chapter 2 ■ Understanding Service Strategy
Capabilities cannot produce value by themselves; they need appropriate and sufﬁ cient 
resources. Equally, sufﬁ cient resources cannot provide value without the appropriate 
capability to make use of them to deliver value. It is the combination of resources 
and capabilities that enables a process to take place in order to deliver successful 
service management. 
Governance and Its Place in the Lifecycle
ITIL deﬁ nes governance as:
Ensures that policies and strategy are actually implemented, and 
that required processes are correctly followed. Governance includes 
defining roles and responsibilities, measuring and reporting, and taking 
actions to resolve any issues identified.
Governance is an area where IT and the business meet, and the two should operate 
together according to a common direction, policies, and rules for both parties to achieve 
the organizational goals.
It is often the case that service management initiatives are unsuccessful when 
they ignore the corporate governance approach and attempt to impose their own 
structures. Service management must include the standards and policies of corporate 
governance, which may require adaptation of best-practice approaches for the individual 
circumstance.
It is important to have a consistent approach for management at all levels of the organi-
zation. This begins with setting a clear strategy and deﬁ ning the policies that drive the way 
it will be achieved. Policies also provide structure and boundaries, which will control the 
way that the organization carries out its operational approach. Governance also provides 
the controls for the strategy itself, in terms of evaluation, monitoring, and direction for the 
strategic goal of the organization.
There is an international standard for corporate governance of IT, designated ISO/
IEC 38500. Information on this standard is available from the International Standards 
 Organization (www.iso.org).
The role of governance is often the driver for improvement activity, so as well as being 
important in the role for strategic policy setting, it also plays a signiﬁ cant role in continual 
service improvement (CSI). CSI will have an effect on service strategy, as it will on the 
whole of the lifecycle, and as a result, governance provides structure across the whole of the 
service lifecycle.
Management of Risk in Service Management
In terms of risk management, the Service Strategy publication does not provide a com-
prehensive organization-wide approach but considers the basic risk management that is 
required by a project implementing an IT service management approach.

Understanding Key Concepts of Service Strategy 
35
However, it is important to understand that any risk management approach that is 
adopted for IT should be complementary to the approach in place for the organization as a 
whole. The corporate approach to risk identiﬁ cation, assessment, management, and mitiga-
tion must be enhanced by the IT service provider, not be in conﬂ ict with it.
Identifying Risks
This is where the risk is identiﬁ ed and named, which does not mean you have to immedi-
ately explain or quantify the risk, but it should be possible to capture what may impact the 
project or strategy that is under consideration. 
Each identiﬁ ed or suspected risk should be documented, and the potential consequences 
of the risk captured should be part of the record. A commonly used mechanism for capture 
is a risk register. This is a centralized record of the risks that need to be managed. It will be 
managed through the continual service improvement lifecycle stage.
Analysis of Risks
After the initial identiﬁ cation and capture of potential consequence, it is possible to begin 
analyzing the risk. This is where we consider what the impact will be if the risk becomes a 
reality and the consequence takes place.
The majority of risk management methods use both a numeric and quality  
calibration and description for the risks. It allows you to deﬁ ne the consequences in 
words, as well as an associated numeric value, so that a clear understanding can be 
achieved. The quantitative value is used to calculate a ranking for the risk, while the 
qualitative statements and descriptions are used for the deﬁ nition of how to deal with
or manage the risk.
Risk management has its basis in probability approaches and theories and can be an 
extremely mathematical discipline. Risk is the likelihood or potential for something to 
happen. It is important to ensure that common sense is also applied. A risk that has been 
identiﬁ ed with 100 percent probability is not a risk; it is a certainty. This should be classi-
ﬁ ed as an issue and be recorded and managed accordingly. Similarly, a risk with a 0 percent 
probability can be removed from the risk register.
Managing Risks
As part of the documentation for risk management, each risk should be associated with 
an individual action plan, which incorporates the initial documentation with any out-
comes from the analysis. These individual plans should be collated to form an overall risk 
management plan. This should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the individual risks 
are being managed appropriately and any actions that have been taken are delivering the 
expected results.
Throughout a project, there may be variations in the level of risk associated with an 
activity, and the management of individual risk may be such that it is completely mitigated 
and now has a 0 percent probability of happening. Alternatively, a risk considered to be 

36 
Chapter 2 ■ Understanding Service Strategy
low or unlikely at the start of a program may become high or more likely as circumstances 
change. It is important to continue to review the risk management plan and also to identify 
any new risks that may arise.
This should be part of the best-practice approach for any project management method 
and should also be part of the normal risk management approach adopted for operational 
management.
Risk management is a repetitive activity, and this should become part of the accepted 
culture of any program or initiative.
Understanding Patterns of Business Activity
Because services are there to enable a business activity and the business activity then 
generates the business outcome, it is necessary to understand any patterns in the 
business activity so that you can deliver services that meet the required outcomes. 
From your own experience in your organization, you will recognize that activities 
tend to form patterns if they are repeated frequently enough. These interactions form 
something recognizable and therefore potentially predictable. The more you can predict 
the likely patterns of business activity, the better you can be prepared to ensure the 
levels of capacity and availability meet the requirements of the customer outcome. In 
this way, you will increase the levels of satisfaction with your services and be seen to 
deliver value.
Business activity covers the use of customer assets such as people, processes, 
and applications, as well as the interactions between customers, suppliers, partners, and 
other stakeholders. Capturing and analyzing patterns of business activity are key 
factors in determining strategies that allow you to deliver services to meet customer 
demands. 
Once a pattern of business activity (PBA) has been identiﬁ ed, you should attempt to 
understand the proﬁ le of the PBA and document it. It is recommended that the following 
items should be captured:
Classification This identiﬁ es the type of PBA and may reference its origins (user or 
automated), the type and impact of the outcomes that are supported, and the workload 
associated.
Attributes This includes frequency, volume, location, and duration.
Requirements This includes performance, security, availability, privacy, and tolerance for 
delays. Some of these could be classiﬁ ed as the warranty considerations.
Service Asset Requirements This is used by design teams to capture and understand what 
is required to support a speciﬁ c PBA, in terms of resource and capability. This level of 
detail is important in the understanding of meeting the requirements for demand, as long 
as the actual requirements remain within a given forecast.

F I G U R E 2 . 5 Examples of patterns of business activity
Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
Figure 2.5 shows an example of three PBAs from three separate organizational models. 
In the ﬁ rst, you can see an annual approach to pattern recognition. The greetings card 
company shown in example A will have customers buying according to major holidays 
or events. The IT service provider must recognize the impact of this activity on IT system 
usage and provide sufﬁ cient capability to enable the business to meet its peaks. Decisions 

38 
Chapter 2 ■ Understanding Service Strategy
must be made about carrying spare capacity at nonpeak times or how the workload will be 
balanced at peak times, for a cost-effective provision of service.
In the second example, you can see a weekly pattern of activity, for the use of time-
sheet recording. This is obviously an important system, because it directly relates to the 
billing of external customers for services, so ensuring this can be managed and provided 
cost-effectively is important. It may be possible in this instance to work with the business 
to encourage different behaviors from its staff to enable a smoother PBA for the system, 
perhaps encouraging a daily entry of time allocated. In this way, you can meet the business 
outcome, but with the cooperation of the business in keeping the need for spare capacity 
manageable. 
In the third example, you have a daily pattern to review. The workload of the busi-
ness will not alter, because it is concerned with a print deadline. This is a pattern that will 
require the resources required to be available to match the requirement.
Summary
This chapter explored the purpose, objectives, scope, and value of the service strategy 
phase of the service lifecycle. This included how the phase creates value for the business 
and the value of services across the service lifecycle.
We covered the following key concepts:
■ 
Utility and warranty and value creation
■ 
Assets, resources, and capabilities
■ 
Governance
■ 
Risk management
■ 
Patterns of business activity (PBA)
You learned how these concepts are used in the service strategy lifecycle stage and how 
they relate to the rest of the service lifecycle. The policies and controls that are identiﬁ ed 
and put in place in the service strategy lifecycle stage have an effect on all of the other life-
cycle stages.
Exam Essentials
Be able to differentiate between the purpose, objectives, and scope for the service strategy 
phase of the lifecycle.  The purpose is to provide the strategy for the service lifecycle. 
The objectives include the deﬁ nition of the strategy and governance control. The scope 
 covers deﬁ ning a strategy to meet a customer’s business outcomes and deﬁ ning a strategy 
for managing those services.

Exam Essentials 
39
Understand the terms utility and warranty.  Utility ensures that the service is ﬁ t for 
the purpose, and warranty ensures that the service is ﬁ t for use. Both of these should be 
ensured to deliver value to customers.
Be able to differentiate between resources and capabilities.  Resources are items that 
could be used to assist in the delivery of a service, such as ﬁ nancial capital. Capabilities are 
the assets that represent the organization’s ability to do something to achieve value, such as 
processes. 
Understand the role of governance in the service lifecycle.  Governance is a key part of 
service management throughout the lifecycle. It provides structure and standardization for 
the management of services and unites the IT service provider approach with that of the 
organization.
Understand the role of risk management in the service lifecycle.  Risk management is the 
approach adopted to identify, document, analyze, and mitigate against the likelihood of 
potential impact to a project or service. Developing a consistent corporate approach to risk 
management will ensure a repeatable and manageable process.
Understand the importance of patterns of business activity in the management of 
services.  Patterns of business activity (PBA) are important in understanding the strategic 
and tactical approaches you take to the management of resources and capabilities. You 
need to be aware how you are going to meet the requirements of the business, and captur-
ing, recording, and utilizing PBA will enable you to manage your service provision more 
efﬁ ciently and cost-effectively.

In this chapter, we will cover some of the processes of the 
service strategy phase of the lifecycle. Service portfolio 
 management provides an important source of information 
for managing services across the lifecycle. Financial management consists of 
understanding the costs for IT services, including being able to justify the expenditure 
of those services.  Business relationship management is crucial to ensuring an integrated 
approach to the delivery of services to meet organizational needs.
We will review the purpose, objectives, and scope for each of the processes and consider 
their importance in the service strategy lifecycle stage.
Understanding Service Portfolio 
Management
We will begin this chapter by covering the service portfolio management process, which 
allows you to gain an understanding of the complete portfolio of services provided across 
the lifecycle.
In the Foundation exam syllabus, this process is covered only by the requirement to 
understand the purpose, scope, and objectives of the process. More information about this 
process is available in the lifecycle core publication of Service Strategy, and further educa-
tion on the process can be found in the ITIL qualiﬁ cation scheme.
In the Foundation exam syllabus, the service portfolio management 
 process is covered only by the requirement to understand its purpose, 
scope, and objectives. More information about this process is available in 
the service lifecycle core publication Service Strategy (published by TSO), 
and further education on the process can be found in the ITIL qualification 
scheme.
Purpose of SPM
The purpose of this process is to ensure that you have the appropriate mix of services 
 delivered by the service provider to meet the requirements of the customer. The process 
enables you to track important information about your services, including the investment 
that has been made and the interaction with other services.

Understanding Service Portfolio Management  
45
The information captured in the service portfolio also ensures that you clearly deﬁ ne 
the services and link them to the business outcomes they support. Once you do this, you 
provide the capability for alignment across the whole of the lifecycle through design, transi-
tion, and operation in order to ensure value is delivered to customers.
Objectives of SPM
The following are the objectives of service portfolio management:
■ 
Provide a process that allows an organization to manage its overall service provision. 
As part of this process, you are able to develop mechanisms that allow you to investigate 
and decide on the services to provide to your customers, based on the analysis of the 
potential beneﬁ ts and acceptable levels of risk.
■ Maintain the deﬁ nitive managed portfolio of services provided by the service provider. 
Each service should be identiﬁ ed, along with the business need and outcome it 
supports.
■ Provide an information source that allows the organization to understand and evaluate 
how the IT services provided enable them to achieve their desired outcomes. It will also 
be a mechanism for tracking how IT can respond to organizational changes in an 
internal or external environment.
■ Provide control over which services are offered, to whom, with what level of investment, 
and under what conditions.
■ Track the organizational spend on IT services throughout their lifecycle, allowing for 
regular reviews of the strategy to ensure that the appropriate investment is being made 
for the chosen strategic approach.
■ Provide information to enable decision making regarding the viability of services and 
when they should be retired.
Scope of SPM
Service portfolio management has a very broad scope, because it covers all the services a 
service provider delivers, as well as those that it is planning to deliver and those that have 
been retired from live operation.
Because the primary concern of the service portfolio management process is to under-
stand if the services being provided are delivering value, the process should cover the ability 
to track investment and expenditure on services. This can then be compared to the desired 
business outcomes.
Internal and external service providers may have a different approach from the way they 
connect services to business outcomes. For an internal service provider, it will be necessary 
to work closely with the business units in the organization to compare the outcomes with 
the investment. External service providers are more likely to have this information captured 
as part of the agreement or contract that deﬁ nes the relationship with the business. The 
services they provide are also more likely to be directly associated to revenue generation or 
support revenue generation services.

46 
Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
Service portfolio management should be responsible for evaluating the value of the 
services provided throughout the whole of their lifecycle. It is also important to be able 
to compare the merits of the existing services against those that are being planned or the 
 beneﬁ ts they provide in replacing retired services. In this way, you can be certain that 
the services provided meet the required business outcomes.
The Service Portfolio
We will now review the service portfolio, which is the output from the process. Figure 3.1 
gives an overview.

F I G U R E 3 .1  The service portfolio
Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
The service portfolio is the complete set of services managed by a service provider. This 
includes the contractual and ﬁ nancial commitments across internal, external, or third-party 
providers; new service development activity; and improvement initiatives. All services 
should be included, whether they are visible, customer-facing services or the enhancing, 
enabling services that support them.
The service portfolio consists of three sections: the pipeline section, which contains 
information about the services that are in a pre-operational state; the service catalog 
 section, which is the customer-facing section of the service portfolio that shows details of 
live operational services; and the retired section, which contains details of the services that 
have been retired.

Understanding the Financial Management Process 
47
The service portfolio also covers the services that are currently only in a conceptual 
stage—potentially the services that would be developed if there were no limit on budget, 
resources, or capabilities. This will be maintained in the pipeline section of the service 
portfolio. It may seem strange to document what you currently cannot achieve, but by 
doing so, you will be able to allow for better assessment of your existing delivery and deter-
mine whether you are allocating resources and capabilities efﬁ ciently.
From the service portfolio, you can see the allocation of all the resources in use across 
the whole service lifecycle. Each stage of the lifecycle will be making demands on available 
resources and capabilities, and the service portfolio allows you to see those allocations and 
resolve any potential conﬂ icts according to the importance of the business outcomes.
Any new project or development should have an approved ﬁ nancial plan and allocated 
budget, demonstrating the cost recovery or return on investment, and this will be captured 
in the service portfolio. By ensuring you have the right mix of services across the pipeline 
and catalog, you can make sure you have the correct funding for all of the IT service 
 provider activities across the service lifecycle. A balanced approach to the introduction of 
new services and development of services, compared to the maintenance of live services, 
will ensure that you can manage any conﬂ ict in resource allocation.
As you will see in Chapter 6, the service catalog is the only part of the service portfolio 
that is customer-facing, although the other information the service portfolio contains may 
be used as part of customer-facing reports, presentations, and business cases. The live 
operational services, as captured in the service catalog, are the only services that will be 
expected to demonstrate cost recovery or proﬁ tability.
Understanding the Financial 
Management Process
Organizations have to be able to manage their ﬁ nances, but it is a complex process used 
across an entire organization. It is normally owned by a very senior executive and managed 
as a separate business function. It is an extremely important area that allows organizations 
to manage resources and ensure that their objectives are being achieved.
The IT service provider, as part of the overall organization, must be involved in the 
ﬁ nancial management process. It is important to make sure that all ﬁ nancial practices 
are aligned; even though a separate process may be used, it should follow the overall 
organizational principles and requirements.
Purpose of Financial Management
To design, develop, and deliver the services that meet the organizational requirements, you 
must secure an appropriate level of funding. This is the main purpose of ﬁ nancial manage-
ment for IT services. At the same time, the ﬁ nancial management process should act as a 
gatekeeper for the expenditure on IT services to ensure that the service provider is not 

48 
Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
over-extended ﬁ nancially for the services that the service provider is required to deliver. 
Obviously, this will require a balance between the cost and quality of the service, in line 
with the balance of supply and demand between the service provider and their customers.
Cost and quality are key factors in the provision of services, and the only way you can 
allocate and understand the cost of service provision is through sound ﬁ nancial practices.
Objectives of Financial Management
The following are the objectives of the ﬁ nancial management process:
■ Deﬁ ning and maintaining a ﬁ nancial framework that allows the service provider to 
identify, manage, and communicate the actual cost of service delivery.
■ 
Understanding and evaluating the ﬁ nancial impact and implications of any new or 
changed organizational strategies on the service provider.
■ 
Securing the funding that is required for providing the services. This will require sig-
niﬁ cant input from the business and will naturally depend on the overall approach to 
ﬁ nancial management and cross charging within the organization.
■ 
Working with the service asset and conﬁ guration management process (covered in 
Chapter 9) to ensure service and customer assets are being properly maintained and all 
associated costs are recorded.
■ 
Performing basic ﬁ nancial accounting in respect of the relationship between expenses 
and income and ensuring they are balanced according to the overall organizational 
requirements.
■ 
Reporting on and managing expenditure for service provision, on behalf of the stake-
holders.
■ 
Management and execution of the organization’s policies and practices relating to 
ﬁ nancial controls.
■ 
Ensuring that ﬁ nancial controls and accounting practices are applied to the creation, 
delivery, and support of services.
■ 
Understanding the future ﬁ nancial requirements of the organization and providing 
ﬁ nancial forecasts for the service commitments and any required compliance for legis-
lative and regulatory controls.
■ 
If appropriate, deﬁ ning a framework that allows for recovering the costs of service pro-
vision from the customer.
Scope of Financial Management
Financial management is normally a well-recognized activity in any organization, but the 
speciﬁ c requirement to manage funding related to the provision of IT services may not be 
so well established.
It is important to understand the strategic approach that is adopted in relation to IT 
 service provision. How will it be managed; is it internally or externally sourced? If it’s 

Understanding the Financial Management Process 
49
internal, is there a requirement to cross charge for services, or is there some other mecha-
nism of cost recovery in place?
In the majority of organizations, there will be qualiﬁ ed accountants in charge of the 
 corporate ﬁ nances, usually as part of the ﬁ nance department. They will set the policies, 
standards, and accounting practices for the business. The strategy relating to IT funding 
will be part of the overall accounting approach, but the speciﬁ cs may be managed locally 
as part of the IT department.
Those engaged in ﬁ nancial management for IT services must ensure that the practices 
are consistent with existing corporate controls and that reporting and accounting activi-
ties meet with the governance standards as deﬁ ned for the whole organization. This will 
also assist with general understanding by the various business units of how IT is funded. 
Communication and the reporting of internal funding practices across an organization are 
extremely important for enabling a true understanding of the costs of IT services.
Using a service management approach to delivering services should mean that the 
accounting for IT services is more effective, detailed, and efﬁ cient than it would be other-
wise. For an internal service provider, this will enable a translation of information between 
service provider and business.
Financial management consists of three main processes:
Budgeting This is the process of predicting and controlling the income and expenditure 
of money within an organization. Budgeting consists of a periodic cycle (usually annual) of 
negotiation to set budgets and the monthly monitoring of the same.
Accounting This is the process that enables the IT organization to account fully for the 
way that its money has been spent. It should enable a cost breakdown by customer, service, 
activity, or other factor to demonstrate the allocation of funds. It will normally require 
some form of accounting system (ledgers, charts of accounts, journal, and so on) and 
should be managed and overseen by someone with an accountancy qualiﬁ cation or skills.
Charging This is the process required to bill customers for the use of the services and will 
be applicable only where the organizational accounting model requires it to take place. It 
requires sound accounting practices and supporting systems so that any cross charging is 
accurate and traceable.

Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
The two cycles are as follows:
■ 
Planning (annual), where cost projections and workload forecasting form a basis for 
cost calculations and price setting
■ 
Operational (monthly or quarterly), where costs are monitored and checked against 
budgets, bills are issued, and revenue is collected
Preparing and Using a Business Case
One of the key beneﬁ ts of having an established ﬁ nancial management process is the 
ability to capture and understand costs and use this information to create justiﬁ cation 
for expenditure in the form of a business case.
A business case should be a tool for decision planning and support, allowing you to pre-
dict the likely consequences of a business decision. This outcome may be either quantitative 
or qualitative; for example, ﬁ nancial analysis is a common feature of a business case.
In Table 3.2, you can see an example of a basic structure for a business case.
TA B L E 3 . 2  Structure of a business case
A. Introduction
Presents the business objectives addressed by the 
 service.
B. Methods and assumptions
Defines the boundaries of the business case, such as 
time period and which organizational context is being 
used to define costs and benefits.
C. Business impacts
The financial and nonfinancial results anticipated for 
the service or service management initiative. Please 
bear in mind that many nonfinancial results can also be 
expressed in financial terms. For example, an increase in 
staff morale can result in lower staff turnover and there-
fore less expenditure on hiring and training.
D. Risks and contingencies
The probability that alternative results will emerge.
E. Recommendations
The specific actions recommended.
Two main considerations for any business case are business objectives and business 
impact.
Business Objectives
Obviously business objectives will vary from organization to organization. However, they 
should form a key part of any business case. It is only by examining and understanding 

Understanding the Financial Management Process

the business objectives that you can properly appreciate the impact to the business of the 
 proposal under consideration in the business case. Objectives should start broadly:
■ 
Commercial provider organizations usually have objectives that are the organization’s 
overall objectives in terms of ﬁ nancial and organizational performance.
■ 
Where the service provider is internal, the objectives are likely to be linked to business 
units, which in turn are linked to the overall organizational objectives.
■ 
Business objectives for nonproﬁ t organizations are more complex but are usually 
 associated with the users or members who beneﬁ t from the organization’s goals, 
as well as the standard ﬁ nancial objectives.
Business Impact
There is a strong relationship between the business objective and the business impact, as 
shown in the following ﬁ gures. Figure 3.2 illustrates one aspect of this, and Figure 3.3 
shows the converse.

Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
Once you are clear on the business objectives, you can begin to understand the business 
impact. Often the majority of the business case argument will be reliant on cost analysis, 
but there are other considerations for service management. There are potential nonﬁ nancial 
impacts, including market image and perceptions of business ethics that could have an 
effect on sales or customer satisfaction.
When the term business case is used, it is common to consider only the ﬁ nancial aspects, 
but service management needs to include more than this, and a successful business will 
appreciate this. So, a business case should include both ﬁ nancial and nonﬁ nancial 
recommendations. Much of the information required can be found as part of the service 
portfolio, because it will provide data for existing services and allow for comparing 
a new proposal.

Relationship Management Process
Business relationship management has matured as a process over time, because initially it 
was simply a role fulﬁ lled to ensure the business had a named contact within the IT service 
provider. But now, as part of a mature service management approach, we recognize the

need for the process of business relationship management as a strategic process in its own 
right, not just as a role supporting service level management at an executive level.
The process of business relationship management provides a connection between 
 organizational executives and the strategic management of the service provider.
In the Foundation exam syllabus, this process is covered only by the 
requirement to understand the purpose, scope, and objectives of 
the process. More information about this process is available in the 
 lifecycle core publication of Service Strategy, and further education 
on the process can be found in the ITIL qualification scheme.
Purpose of the BPM Process
This process has a very important part to play in the alignment of the IT service provider 
and the customer.
The purpose of the process is twofold:
■ 
Establish a relationship between the service provider and the customer, and maintain 
this by continuing to review the business and customer needs. This relationship is 
extremely important for building a rapport between the service provider and the 
customer.
■ 
Identify customer needs and ensure that the service provider can meet those needs, 
both now and in the future. Business relationship management is the process that 
ensures the service provider is able to understand the changing needs of the business 
over time. The relationship also allows the customer to articulate the value of the 
services to the service provider.
One of the most important concepts in this relationship is that of expectation—the 
customer’s expectation of the service provider’s capabilities and the service provider’s 
expectation of the customer’s needs. It is critical that the expectation of the customer does 
not exceed what they are prepared to pay for, and business relationship management is 
instrumental in managing this communication.
Objectives of the BPM Process
The objectives of business relationship management are as follows:
■ 
Ensure that the service provider has a clear understanding of the customer’s perspective 
of the service so that you are able to prioritize the services and assets accordingly.
■ 
Ensure that customer satisfaction remains high, which will demonstrate that the  service 
is achieving the needs of the customer.

54 
Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
■ 
Establish and maintain a relationship between the customer and service provider that 
enables understanding of the business drivers and the customer.
■ 
Ensure that the organization and the service provider communicate effectively so 
that the service provider will be aware of any changes to the customer environment. 
Changes to the customer environment may have an impact on the services provided.
■ 
Identify technology changes or trends that may have an impact on the type, level, or 
utilization of the service provided.
■ 
Ensure that the service provider is able to articulate the business requirements for new 
or changed services and that services continue to meet the needs of the business and 
continue to deliver value.
■ 
Provide mediation where there is conﬂ ict on the use of services between business units. 
This may be a conﬂ ict of resource allocation, or perhaps the requirement to utilize or 
change functionality differs for speciﬁ c departments.
■ 
Establish a formal procedure for managing complaints and escalations with the cus-
tomer. This is a common requirement for governance standards, because it demon-
strates a commitment to customer satisfaction and improvement.
Scope of the BPM Process
The scope of business relationship management will vary depending on the nature and 
culture of the organization. If the organization works with an internal service provider, 
it is likely that the business relationship management will be carried out between senior 
management representatives in both the IT department and business units. Often in larger 
organizations, you will be able to ﬁ nd dedicated business relationship managers (BRMs), 
but in smaller organizations the role can be combined with other managerial responsibility. 
The BRM will work with the customer representatives to understand the objectives of the 
business and ensure that the services provided are in alignment and supportive of those 
objectives.
If an external service provider supports the organization, you will commonly ﬁ nd that 
a dedicated account manager carries out the process, with an individual allocated to a 
 customer or group of smaller customers with similar requirements. As the external  service 
provider relationship with the business is captured in a contract, the focus will be on 
achieving the contractual obligations and customer satisfaction with the service value.
One of the major requirements for business relationship management is to focus on 
understanding how the services you provide meet the requirements of your customers. The 
process needs to ensure that you can communicate effectively with your customers so that 
you can understand their needs. The following are some of the key areas you 
should consider:
■ 
Business outcomes, so that you understand what the customer wants to achieve.
■ 
How the customer uses your services and which services are being offered to them.

Understanding the Business Relationship Management Process 
55
■ 
How you manage the services that are being offered, in terms of responsibility for 
the provision, the service levels you deliver, and the quality of service that is being 
achieved. You should also consider any changes that may be required in response to 
business and IT plans.
■ 
As IT service providers, it is vital that you keep track of technology trends and 
advances that may impact your service delivery. All too often, customers will hear 
about new technologies but not understand the impact of them, so it is the responsibil-
ity of business relationship management to ensure that you communicate and advise on 
the best use of technology to deliver service value.
■ 
You need to measure the levels of customer satisfaction and respond to any drop in 
 satisfaction with suitable action plans. The BRM will be a key ﬁ gure in the communica-
tion and management of any such plans.
■ 
How you can optimize the service you provide for the future.
■ 
The business relationship management process should be concerned with the way that 
the service provider is represented to the customer. This may mean engaging with the 
business to ensure that commitments from both sides have been fulﬁ lled.
To successfully carry out the process of business relationship management and so that 
all of the previous factors can be considered, it is necessary to work with other service 
management processes and functions. For example, the ability to associate business out-
comes with services is part of service portfolio management; service level management 
provides information about service levels and their achievement; and service asset and 
conﬁ guration management maps customers and service owners to the infrastructure, 
applications, and services.
This interaction between the processes of business relationship management and service-
level management will require clear boundaries, relationships, and responsibilities to be 
 identiﬁ ed between business relationship management and other service management processes, 
because there is a strong potential for confusion. Business relationship management should 
focus on the relationship between the customer and service provider, as well as the achievement 
of customer satisfaction, but the other service management processes should focus on the 
services themselves and how well they meet the agreed requirements.
Business relationship management does not ignore the services, but it should be focused 
on the high-level perspective of whether the service is meeting the business needs, rather 
than on speciﬁ c targets for delivery. Equally, the other service management processes do 
not ignore this aspect of customer satisfaction, but they should be focused on the quality of 
the services and how customer expectations can be met.
An example of this is the difference between the service level management and business 
relationship management processes. They both have regular interaction with customers and 
are concerned with the ongoing review and management of service and service quality. But 
each has a different purpose, and the nature of the interface with the customer differs in 
content and responsibility.
This is clearly shown in Table 3.3, which is an extract from the core publication Service 
Strategy.

management 
Business relationship 
management
Service level 
management
Purpose
To establish and maintain a busi-
ness relationship between the 
service provider and the customer 
based on understanding the cus-
tomer and its business needs.
To identify customer needs (utility 
and warranty) and ensure that the 
service provider is able to meet 
these needs.
To negotiate service level agreements 
(warranty terms) with customers and 
ensure that all service management 
processes, operational-level agree-
ments, and underpinning contracts 
are appropriate for the agreed service-
level targets.
Focus
Strategic and tactical—the focus 
is on the overall relationship 
between the service provider and 
their customer, as well as which 
services the service provider will 
deliver to meet customer needs.
Tactical and operational—the focus 
is on reaching agreement on the level 
of service that will be delivered for 
new and existing services and whether 
the service provider was able to meet 
those agreements.
Primary 
measure
Customer satisfaction, also an 
improvement in the customer’s 
intention to better use and pay 
for the service. Another metric is 
whether customers are willing to 
recommend the service to other 
(potential) customers.
Achieving agreed levels of 
service (which leads to customer 
satisfaction).
Business relationship management is also concerned with the design of services, which 
makes BRMs the ideal contact for strategic communication with customers for all depart-
ments in the service provider. There is a potential connection for business relationship 
 management with application development, as well as other development and design areas.
There are many connections and similarities between business relationship manage-
ment and service level management and other service management processes, and the 
roles are often combined. But as you can see from Table 3.4, there are distinct differences 
in the activities for the processes, and there needs to be a clear understanding that when 
 carrying out business relationship management, an individual needs to be aware when they 
are working on a strategic business relationship and when they are working tactically. For 
example, making long-term plans and managing a business relationship at a very senior 
level are part of a strategic approach, whereas working with services on an operational 
basis will be part of a tactical approach.

Summary
In this chapter, you explored how the service management processes in the service strategy 
phase of the lifecycle contribute to the whole service lifecycle.
You learned about the processes in the service strategy stage, considering the purpose, 
objectives, and scope for the following processes:
■ 
Service portfolio management
■ 
Financial management (including the use and value of the business case)
■ 
Business relationship management

58 
Chapter 3 ■ Service Strategy Processes
Each of these processes is important in managing the strategic approach to the 
service lifecycle. The service portfolio provides information that is used throughout 
the service lifecycle, and the ﬁ nancial management process is used to manage costs and 
budgets for all the lifecycle stages.
Business relationship management is a key process in the management of services, 
because it provides the high-level, strategic interface to the customers who pay for the 
 services provided by the IT service provider.
Exam Essentials
Recall the purpose of the service portfolio management process. The process ensures you 
have an appropriate mix of services being delivered and developed for your customers.
Identify the various components of the service portfolio. The service portfolio comprises 
the service pipeline, which shows services prior to live operation; the service catalog, which 
shows the customer-facing view of the live operational services; and the retired services, 
which shows information about decommissioned services.
Identify the three main areas of the financial management process. The three main 
areas are budgeting, which is planning for expenditure; IT accounting, which is where you 
account for the expenditure on IT services; and charging, which is where the customer 
is charged for the IT services if this is appropriate. Financial management is crucial for 
 calculating value for services.
Understand the purpose of a business case. A business case is a tool for decision making. 
Much of the information required will be part of the service portfolio and part of the 
ﬁ nancial management reports and outputs.
Understand the purpose of business relationship management. This is the process that 
connects the customer and the service provider at a strategic level.
Be able to differentiate between business relationship management and the other service 
management processes, especially service level management. Remember, business 
relationship management is concerned with a strategic relationship with the customer, 
whereas other processes are more tactically based.

The success or failure of a service is largely dependent on its 
design. As a result, the ITIL framework spends a lot of time 
looking at this key lifecycle stage, so we will be spending the 
next few chapters covering service design and its processes. 
This stage starts with a customer requirement for a new or changed service and ﬁ nishes 
when a service that matches that need is ready to be handed over to the transition phase 
(together with the service design package that documents all aspects of the design). It is the 
aim of the transition stage to build and test the service and deploy it successfully into the 
operational environment, where it becomes the responsibility of the operation stage.
Poor design may mean that the service never delivers the value envisaged in the strategy 
stage. In Chapter 2, “Understanding Service Strategy,” we discussed the need for services 
to provide utility and warranty in order to deliver value. If a service is unable to deliver 
the level of service required consistently (because of poor availability, capacity issues, 
insufﬁ cient security, or a lack of service continuity), it will have failed to deliver the 
warranty required. It has often been an issue that design projects concentrate on delivering 
the utility of a new service but spend too little time ensuring that warranty is also delivered. 
It is the combination of these two aspects that deliver value (as we discussed when we 
covered the service strategy stage of the lifecycle in Chapter 2). Designing a service without 
considering what service levels it will need to meet will result in a service that fails to meet 
the customer’s requirements or requires expensive amendments once it is in operation.
Understanding the Purpose, Objectives, 
and Scope for Service Design
Service design is involved in planning both new services and changes to existing services, 
ensuring that the new or changed service fulﬁ lls the service strategy by delivering the 
business objectives. It touches all areas of IT because each area will have a role in delivering 
and supporting the eventual service. It includes the design of both services and the service 
management processes, which will ensure that the service continues to provide value.
 Successful design depends on taking the time to plan ahead. This is often seen as wasted 
time, with the service provider anxious to press ahead with the design. In fact, nothing 
could be further from the truth; insufﬁ cient planning leads to costly rework and delay 
later. Part of the planning phase is identifying and managing risks to ensure a successful 
outcome.

Understanding the Purpose, Objectives, and Scope for Service Design 
63
The Purpose of Service Design
The purpose of service design is to deliver a new service or a change to an existing 
service that is capable of delivering the strategic outcome required. This involves not 
only the technology used to deliver the service but the processes and policies needed to 
ensure that the technical solution delivers the intended value. It considers what will be 
required by the transition phase to implement the service in the operational environment, 
how the service will perform, and what will be required to support it. Service design must 
ensure that the service runs within the allocated budget and delivers a level of service that 
meets or exceeds the customer requirement.
The Objectives of Service Design
In an ideal world, services would be designed so well that they would require little or no 
improvement later. Although this is not realistic, service design should aim to deliver a 
service that will require very little improvement later. This is not to say that there is no 
role for continual service improvement; every design effort should apply lessons learned 
from previous design projects because these lessons can improve the eventual output. The 
business requirement may also change, requiring improvements to the original design.
Service design activities may be undertaken on a regular basis or as the result of 
identifying a new or changed business requirement.
The Scope of Service Design
ITIL service design considers not only the current requirement; it extrapolates from this to 
identify possible future needs and ensures that the service being designed will be able to be 
developed to meet these requirements too. It ensures that the design ﬁ ts the requirements, 
and tries to take advantage of technical developments to deliver an innovative service.
It is essential that the service is aligned with the business need, so service design describes 
how to identify these requirements and ensure that the service delivers what the customer 
requires. It considers the functional requirements that must be delivered as well as the 
required service levels. It ensures that any design constraints are identiﬁ ed and adhered to.
The processes included within service design are as follows:
■ 
Design coordination
■ 
Service catalog management
■ 
Service level management
■ 
Availability management
■ 
Capacity management
■ 
IT service continuity management
■ 
Information security management 
■ 
Supplier management

64 
Chapter 4 ■ Understanding Service Design
We will be examining these processes in later chapters. It is important to remember 
that these processes are considered during the design stage, but many of their activities 
also take place during other lifecycle stages. Service level management, for example, has 
to be considered during design to ensure the service is designed to meet the service level 
requirements. Once the service is operational, however, service level management is involved 
in monitoring, reporting, and improving the level of service being delivered and works 
closely with continual service improvement to implement any service improvement plans.
All processes across the lifecycle must be linked; it is important to understand how these 
various processes interact so that an amendment to one process does not have unintended 
consequences on another.
The Value Service Design Provides to the Business 
As we mentioned, good service design delivers high-performing services that match the 
business requirement and are delivered at an affordable cost. Following the service design 
guidelines in the ITIL framework will have a number of positive outcomes for the business.
Foremost among these is a lower total cost of ownership across the lifetime of the 
service, because all aspects of the design, processes, and technology have been considered 
and designed to work together, therefore minimizing later rework. Good design will also 
consider the corporate strategy and existing architecture, as well as any design constraints, 
to ensure that the service operates within these parameters. 
By ensuring that the warranty aspects of the service are included during the design 
stages, the service design delivers a reliable, effective service that meets the customer 
requirement. The service will be designed to meet the agreed service level requirements and 
will ensure the required capacity, availability, and service continuity requirements are met 
cost-effectively.
Service design considers not only how the service will perform in the live operational 
environment; it also considers the most effective way of enabling the transition from design 
to live, ensuring that all the required information for this transition stage is captured in a 
service design package (SDP).
Service design will consider what metrics and controls may be required for good 
governance and ensure that these are part of the design. Ensuring that the design gathers 
the appropriate metrics will assist in the continual service improvement of the service in the 
future. It will also consider what processes are required and ensure that these are designed 
to be both effective and efﬁ cient.
Finally, service design will consider particular strategic requirements, such as using 
cloud technologies or delivering services with the lowest possible carbon footprint, 
ensuring that the design is aligned with these business requirements.
Describing the Service 
ITIL recommends producing a key output from the service design stage—a service design 
package (SDP). The service design package consists of one or more documents, produced 
during the service design stage, that describe all aspects of the service, throughout its 

Four Key Elements of Service Design 
65
lifecycle. It contains all the necessary information that will be used to transition and 
operate the service. It is passed forward to the transition stage so that those transitioning 
the service have a clear understanding of the requirements that need to be veriﬁ ed in testing. 
Typical contents of an SDP include the following:
■ 
Original agreed business requirements for the service
■ 
How the service will be used
■ 
Key contacts and stakeholders
■ 
Functional requirements
■ 
Management requirements
■ 
Service level requirements
■ 
Technical design of the new or changed service including hardware, software, 
 networks, environments, data, applications, technology, tools, and documentation
■ 
Sourcing strategy
■ 
New or changed processes required to support the service
■ 
Organizational readiness assessment
■ 
Service lifecycle plan, including the timescales and phasing, for the transition, 
 operation, and subsequent improvement of the new service
■ 
Service program, service transition plan
■ 
Service operational acceptance plan 
■ 
Service acceptance criteria (SAC)
A large amount of information is gathered during the design stage, often as part of a 
formal project management methodology; the production of the SDP ensures that all the 
relevant information is captured when the project ends and is passed on to those who will 
be transitioning, managing, and improving the new or changed service. 
Four Key Elements of Service Design
Service design, as described within the ITIL framework, takes a holistic view of what 
is required to design and deliver a service. A frequent error in service design is that this 
view, encompassing all aspects, is replaced with a narrow, technical view of the design. 
Such a design may work well in theory but fail to deliver in practice because of the lack of 
attention given to changes to processes that may be required, the skills required for users 
and those providing support of the service, or the poor choice of third-party suppliers.
Successful service design must therefore consider the four key elements, sometimes 
known as the four p’s:
■ 
People
■ 
Processes
■ 
Products
■ 
Partners

66 
Chapter 4 ■ Understanding Service Design
People
The best technical design will fail if the people who need to use it or support it are not 
adequately prepared. The people element of service design ensures that the human aspect 
is not forgotten. In Chapter 2, we covered resources and capabilities; Figure 2.4 describing 
resources and capabilities showed “people” as both a resource (you need the right number of 
people) and a capability (you need the right people, with the right skills). Service designers 
must consider how many people will be required to support the new service (resource) 
and what skill set they will require to do so effectively (capability). Training in the speciﬁ c 
processes required to support the service will also be necessary. The people who will be using 
the service will also need training in its use in order to gain the full beneﬁ t of the service. 
If existing staff members are to be used, a training needs analysis will be required, 
and adequate time and money need to be budgeted for training. A communications 
plan that ensures the right information is given to the right people at the right time 
by the most appropriate method will also be needed in order to ensure that the staff 
members understand what is required of them. If new staff members are to be recruited, 
consideration must be given to drawing up job descriptions, assessing job grades, and 
deﬁ ning the required skills and experience that candidates must have. An induction into the 
organization will also be required. Recruiting staff can be time-consuming, so it is essential 
that adequate time is allocated to this task if the delivery of the service is not to be delayed.
Processes
The second element to be considered is that of processes. In addition to the service 
design processes described in the ITIL framework, the new service may require additional 
processes to be designed, such as an authorization or procurement process. Some IT 
service providers may ignore the need to design either of these groups of processes in order 
to shorten the “speed to market” time; this is a false economy. Failure to consider the 
future capacity requirements of the service—for example, because the design appears to 
be adequate—could cause problems later when the service is unable to support increased 
demand without a major redesign. If the new service becomes business-critical, failure to 
design sufﬁ cient resilience may mean that poor availability impacts the business.
As part of service design, processes should be documented, together with the interfaces 
between them and other processes. All existing processes across the lifecycle should 
be assessed to identify whether any changes to them are required to enable this new 
or changed service to become operational and be supportable. Each process should be 
examined to ensure that the activities described are measurable so that they can be assessed 
for effectiveness and efﬁ ciency and be improved as required.
Products
Products are not only the services that result from the service design stage itself but also the 
technology and tools that are chosen to assist in the design or to support the service later. 
So, for example, the service design may be for an online shopping service, and the other

products may include a credit-card processing application, an automatic stock reordering 
service when stock levels reach a threshold, monitoring tools to alert the service provider if 
user response time exceeds a set time, and so on.
Partners
Partners are those specialist suppliers—usually external third-party suppliers, 
manufacturers, and vendors—that provide part of the overall service. Ensuring the 
correct supplier is chosen is essential, because failure by a supplier may cause the IT 
service provider to breach an agreed service level (we examine the importance of supplier 
performance in achieving service level targets in more detail in Chapter 5). External 
suppliers are managed through the supplier management process, which ensures that the 
necessary contracts are put in place and monitors the delivery by the supplier against 
the contract terms. Supplier management is covered in Chapter 6.

Chapter 4 ■ Understanding Service Design
Services are composed of the following:  
■ 
The business processes that the IT service is going to support need to be understood if 
the design is to deliver what is required. 
■ 
The designer must ensure that the service being designed fulﬁ lls all the utility 
requirements—removing constraints or enhancing performance—in addition to 
abiding by any governance or reporting requirements and ensuring the service is in 
line with the organization’s strategic goals.
■ 
As we discuss in Chapter 5, “Service Level Management: Aligning IT with Business 
Requirements,” the service level requirements for the new or changed service must be 
understood, and the necessary service level agreements and supporting agreements 
with support teams and suppliers need to be put in place.
■ 
The designer must specify all the technical components of the service, using the con-
ﬁ guration management system to show how these are linked to provide the service. 
The CMS is described in Chapter 9. The environmental aspects of the technical design 
must be documented, so that the operations management function understands what is 
required in terms of power, air conditioning, and so on.
■ 
The applications that will provide the functional requirements of the business process 
and the data they require will also form part of the overall design speciﬁ cation.
■ 
It is essential to understand what other services support the new or changed service; 
deﬁ ning these dependencies will be done using the CMS, and service level management 
and supplier management will ensure that these supporting services deliver the level of 
service required.
■ 
Finally, the service management processes that support the service must be docu-
mented and communicated to those who need to follow them.
Only when all these requirements are met and the interdependencies between them are 
understood and documented can there be conﬁ dence that the service will work as designed 
and deliver the beneﬁ ts required.
Five Major Aspects of Service Design 
As mentioned, concentrating on just the service solution will not be sufﬁ cient; other aspects 
need to be considered. The design process must take a holistic approach to designing new 
or changed services, because success depends not only on the technical solution but also 
the management and architectural environment in which that solution is to operate, the 
processes and skills that will be required to ensure it runs effectively, and the metrics that 
need to be provided to monitor and manage it. In the next two chapters, we will cover 
the service design processes; however, in order for them to be effective, the following ﬁ ve 
essential elements of design must be considered.

Five Major Aspects of Service Design  
69
Service Solutions
The ﬁ rst aspect is the solution itself; in other words, the new functionality offered by a 
new application or other service. The requirements will have been deﬁ ned in the service 
portfolio; it is the job of service design to deliver a solution that meets these requirements 
within any technical or ﬁ nancial constraints that exist. The solution must conform to 
corporate rules and must work with the existing services. The supporting services must be 
able to deliver to the level required; if this is not possible, the overall design will need to 
be altered. Figure 4.2 shows typical design constraints.
Five Key Aspects
You may ﬁ nd it helps to remember these by using the acronym STAMP:

Chapter 4 ■ Understanding Service Design
It is likely that a structured design approach will be used to deliver the service solution, 
ensuring that it meets the required utility, warranty, and service levels and that it is 
delivered on time and within budget. As the service lifecycle progresses, requirements may 
change, so the approach must be not only structured but also ﬂ exible enough to meet the 
developing requirements.
Management Information Systems and Tools
Management information tools and systems are used to support and automate processes. 
They are usually part of a bigger framework of policies, processes, functions, standards, 
guidelines, and tools in use within the organizations. Organizations may have (for example) 
a quality management system, an information security management system, and the 
service management system. The second aspect to be considered when designing a service, 
therefore, concerns ensuring that the new or changed service will integrate with existing 
management information systems, such as the service knowledge information system 
(SKMS). The SKMS holds details about the service within the service portfolio and service 
catalog. These management information systems need to be examined to ensure that 
they are able to provide the information required to manage the service effectively. These 
management information systems must also be compatible with the rest of the management 
information framework in use within the organization, such as its quality and security 
management systems.
Architectures 
The organization will have existing systems, and the new or changed service will need to be 
compatible with them. This is another aspect to be considered during design. There will 
be an existing architectural platform as well as agreed technical standards, and they 
will need to be evaluated to see whether they can support the new service. If not, then 
either the architectures or management systems will need to be amended or the design of 
the new service will need to be revised.
Architecture and Architecture Design
Architecture is deﬁ ned as the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its 
components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and the principles 
guiding its design and evolution.
Architecture design comprises the development and maintenance of IT policies, strate-
gies, architectures, designs, documents, plans, and processes for the deployment, opera-
tion, and improvement of IT services and solutions.

Summary 
71
Measurement Systems
The next aspect of service design is that of measurement. The design needs to ensure that 
what is being measured meets the requirement. The current metrics that are gathered must 
be sufﬁ cient to enable the service to be assessed for efﬁ ciency and effectiveness. If not, then 
the measurement methods will need to be improved, or the service metric requirement will 
need to be altered.
Processes
Each new or changed service will require processes. These processes may be existing 
processes or speciﬁ c to the service. Any processes, roles, responsibilities, and skills that will 
be required by the new or changed service need to be considered. New processes will need 
to be designed, and existing processes need to be checked to see whether they require any 
improvement in order to support the new service. If they cannot be improved, the design of 
the service will need to be amended. Be aware that the processes being evaluated here are 
not only the processes under service design, but all IT and service management processes 
throughout the lifecycle. Process models can be used to clarify the processes. Remember 
the generic requirements of every process that we discussed in Chapter 1; in particular, all 
processes should have deﬁ ned inputs, outputs, and triggers.
Summary
Good design requires that the service level requirements are thoroughly understood, 
and any gap between these requirements and what is possible using current resources and 
capabilities needs to be identiﬁ ed. The cost of closing this gap must be understood, 
and staff members in all the IT functions should be made aware of the planned service 
so that they can prepare to support it. Those involved in transition should plan how this 
should be done well in advance.
In this chapter, we covered where service design ﬁ ts in the lifecycle, as well as its 
purpose, objectives, and scope. We considered the value good service design brings to 
the business and looked at the key output from this lifecycle stage, the service design 
package. We also covered the four key elements of successful design—having the right 
processes, having the required number of suitably skilled people, using the best products, 
and having appropriate agreements with suppliers. Finally, we considered the ﬁ ve aspects 
of the service design stage, not just the solution itself, but the processes and management 
information systems to support it, the architecture to host it, and the metrics to 
measure it. 
In the following chapter, we will cover some of the service design processes in 
more detail, but it is important to remember these other aspects of the service 
design stage.

Chapter 4 ■ Understanding Service Design
Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the service design lifecycle stage. Service 
design must consider how the service will be run and managed when it is operational. It 
is important to remember also that service design includes the design of both new and 
changed services. 
Understand why good service design is so valuable to the business. It is essential that the 
new or changed design works efﬁ ciently and fulﬁ lls the business requirements in terms of 
capacity, continuity, availability, and security, in addition to delivering new functionality. 
Good service design considers how the service will be delivered and ensures that all aspects 
have been considered.
Be able to explain the contents and purpose of the key output of this lifecycle stage, the 
service design package. You should understand who creates it, who uses it, and why it is 
helpful, and you should be able to list some of its contents.
Understand the four p’s: people, processes, products, and partners. Be able to explain 
why each of these matters to successful service design, considering not only the technical 
solution (products) but also the other organizations (partners) who will be involved in pro-
viding the service and the contractual relationships that will be required with them. Under-
stand the need for new or changed processes in order for the new service to work and for 
the right number of trained people to both use the new service in the business and support 
it in the IT department.
Understand the five key aspects of service design. These can be remembered easily by 
thinking of the acronym STAMP. The ﬁ ve aspects are the Solution that has been designed 
that fulﬁ lls the business requirement and enables the business process to take place; the 
management information systems and Tools that ensure that the right information is 
available when required to support the service; the technical Architecture that underpins 
the solution; the Measurements that will be taken to ensure the service is operating as it 
should, and the new and changed Processes that will need to be developed, both business 
processes and service management processes.

Chapter

This chapter covers the service level management (SLM) pro-
cess. This is one of the process areas we cover in detail, so 
when you come to the exam, you can expect to have questions 
that ask you about the activities and concepts, as well as the purpose, of the process. This 
is an important area, because it is through service level management that the IT service 
provider ensures that the services offered are aligned to the business requirement. It is also 
through this process that the service provider and the customer deal with the possibility 
that the business cannot afford to have the standard of service provision it would like (high 
availability, unlimited capacity, immediate response to incidents, and so on). Through 
negotiation, the provider and the customer agree what is achievable and affordable. By 
monitoring and reviewing the performance against these targets, both parties are able to 
ensure that the service provided continues to meet the requirement. Where issues are identi-
ﬁ ed, improvement plans are agreed on and implemented.
The Purpose, Objectives, and Scope 
of Service Level Management
Let’s begin by looking at the purpose of the service level management process according the 
ITIL framework. ITIL states that the purpose of service level management is to 
ensure that all current and planned IT services are delivered to agreed achievable targets. 
The key words here are agreed and targets. Service level management is about discussing, 
negotiating and agreeing with the customer about what IT services should be provided 
and ensuring that objective measures are used to ascertain whether that service has been 
provided to the agreed level.
Service level management is therefore concerned with deﬁ ning the services, documenting 
them in an agreement, and then ensuring that the targets are measured and met, taking 
action where necessary to improve the level of service delivered. These improvements will 
often be carried out as part of continual service improvement, which we will cover in more 
detail in Chapter 13, “Understanding Continual Service Improvement.”
Note also that the deﬁ nition of service level management talks about current and 
planned IT services. Service level management’s purpose is to not only ensure that all IT 
services currently being delivered have a service level agreement (SLA) in place but also 
ensure that discussion and negotiation takes place regarding the requirements for planned 
services so that an SLA is agreed on and in place when the service becomes operational.

The Purpose, Objectives, and Scope of Service Level Management  
79
It is for this latter reason that service level management is one of the service design 
processes; services must be designed to deliver the levels of availability, capacity, and so 
on, that the customer requires and that service level management documents in the SLA. 
It is a frequent problem that the SLA is not considered until just before (or even after) the 
go-live date, when it is realized that the customer service level requirements are not met by 
the design. We discussed the concepts of utility and warranty in Chapter 2; service level 
management is concerned primarily with the warranty aspects of the service. The response 
time, capacity, availability, and so on, of the new service will be the subject of the SLA, 
and it is essential that the service is therefore designed to meet both utility and warranty 
requirements.
The objectives of service level management are not restricted to “deﬁ ne, document, 
agree, monitor, measure, report, and review” (how well the IT service is delivered) and 
undertaking improvement actions when necessary. It also includes working with business 
relationship management to build a good working relationship with the business customers. 
The regular meetings held with the business as part of service level management form the 
basis of a strong communications channel that strengthens the relationship between the 
customer and IT. 
In Chapter 1, we covered how ITIL differentiates between customers 
and users. This distinction is important in service level management. 
Customers are usually senior people within the organization who specify 
the level of service required, take part in SLM negotiations, and sign the 
agreed SLA. Users are provided with the service but have no direct input 
into the service level to be provided.
It is an essential feature of service level management that the customer and IT agree on 
what constitutes an acceptable level of service. Therefore, one of the objectives of SLM 
is to develop appropriate targets for each IT service. These targets must be speciﬁ c and 
measurable so that there is no debate whether they were achieved. The temptation to use 
expressions such as “as soon as possible” or “reasonable endeavors” should be resisted, 
because the customer and IT may disagree on what constitutes “as soon as possible” or 
what is “reasonable.” By using such expressions in an SLA, it may be impossible for the 
IT service provider to fail, but this leads to cynicism from the customer and damages the 
relationship that the SLM aims to build. Where the IT service provider is an external 
company, the legal department will inevitably seek to reduce the possibility of the provider 
being sued for breach of contract, and these phrases may therefore be included; for an 
internal service provider, there is no such excuse. Using objective success criteria is essential 
if SLM is to achieve another of its objectives, that of ensuring that both the customer and 
IT have “clear and unambiguous expectations” regarding the level of service.
A further SLM objective is to ascertain the level of customer satisfaction with the service 
being provided and to take steps to increase it. There are challenges in this objective, 
because obtaining an accurate assessment of customer satisfaction is not straightforward. 
Customer satisfaction surveys may be completed only by a self-selecting minority. Those who 

80 
Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
are unhappy are more likely to complete such a survey than those who are content. Despite 
this tendency, the service level manager must still attempt to monitor customer satisfaction 
as accurately as possible, using whatever methods are appropriate; in addition to surveys, 
focus groups, and individual interviews, other methods can be employed.
The ﬁ nal objective that ITIL lists for service level management is that of improving the 
level of service, even when the targets are being met. Such improvements must be cost-
effective, so an analysis of the return expected for any ﬁ nancial or resource investment 
must be carried out. SLM actively seeks out opportunities for such cost-effective 
improvements. Achieving this objective forms part of the continual service improvement 
that is an essential element in all ITIL processes.
The scope of service level management includes the performance of existing services 
being provided and the deﬁ nition of required service levels for planned services. It forms 
a regular communication channel between the business and the IT service provider on all 
issues concerning the quality of service. SLM therefore has an important role to play in 
managing customers’ expectations to ensure that the level of service they expect and the 
level of service they perceive they are receiving match. As stated earlier, SLM is concerned 
with ensuring that the warranty aspects of a service are provided to the expected level. The 
level of service expected for planned services is detailed in the service level requirements 
(SLR) speciﬁ cation, and the agreed service levels (following negotiation) are documented 
in the SLA. SLAs should be written to cover all operational services. Through this 
involvement in the design phase, SLM ensures that the planned services will deliver the 
warranty levels required by the business. 
SLM does not include agreeing on the utility aspects.
Each IT service is composed of a number of elements provided by internal support 
teams or external third-party suppliers. An essential element of successful service level 
management is the negotiation and agreement with those who provide each element of the 
service, regarding the level of service that they provide. A failure by these providers will 
translate to a failure to meet the SLA. We will look at these agreements, called operational-
level agreements (OLAs) in the case of internal teams and underpinning contracts in the 
case of external suppliers, later in this chapter.
Finally, SLM includes measuring and reporting on all service achievements compared to 
the agreed targets. The frequency, measurement method, and depth of reporting required is 
agreed as part of the SLA negotiations.
It is important to understand the relationship between service level management and 
business relationship management. SLM deals with issues around the quality of service 
being provided; a business relationship management’s role is more strategic. The business 
relationship manager works closely with the business, understanding its current and future 
IT requirements. It is then the responsibility of the business relationship manager (BRM) 
to ensure that the service provider understands these needs and is able to meet them. SLM 

Capturing Service Level Requirements 
81
is concerned more about how to meet the targets by ensuring that agreements are in place 
with internal and external suppliers to provide elements of the service to the required 
standard. 
Service level management cooperates with and complements business relationship 
management. Similarly, the improvement actions identiﬁ ed by SLM in a service 
improvement plan (SIP) are implemented in conjunction with continual service 
improvement; they are documented in the CSI register, where they are prioritized and 
reviewed.
Providers and Suppliers
It is important to understand the difference between providers and suppliers. Suppliers 
are external organizations that supply an element of the overall service. Customers may 
have little or no knowledge of the suppliers and the contracts that are held with them. 
The IT service provider will usually aim to provide a seamless service to the customer.
Providers fall into three categories; we examined the three types in Chapter 1. To recap, 
they can be embedded in a business unit (Type I), be shared across business units 
(Type II), or be external to the organization (Type III). Type III service providers will have 
an SLA with their external customers that will be a legal contract, because they are 
separate organizations.
The critical difference between suppliers and service providers is that suppliers provide only 
an element of the service and are not visible to the customer, whereas providers (including 
Type III providers) provide the whole service. A Type III provider would typically use a num-
ber of suppliers to provide elements of the service which they were providing, but the ser-
vice level agreement is between the provider and the customer; the provider is responsible 
for ensuring that the supplier fulﬁ lls the contract that the provider has with them.
Capturing Service Level Requirements
Before detailed design work can commence, the service designers must have a good grasp 
of the service level requirements (SLRs). These SLRs represent what is required by the 
customer for a particular aspect of the service, and they are therefore based on business 
objectives. If the business objective is to sell more products through the company website, 
for example, the SLRs will specify the number of simultaneous users the website must be 
able to handle, the speed of response, and so on. 
The high-level SLRs will have been discussed during the strategy phase of the service 
lifecycle and will have been used as an input to the decision whether the service should be 
developed at all. Once the decision has been made and the service moves into the design 
phase, it is the responsibility of SLM to expand upon and clarify these and any additional 
requirements.

82 
Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
As stated previously, SLRs relate primarily to the warranty aspects of the service, 
deﬁ ning the capacity, security, availability, and service continuity requirements. They 
must be delivered in conjunction with the utility aspects deﬁ ned elsewhere, if the service 
is to deliver value. The SLRs are an essential element of the service design speciﬁ cation, 
and speciﬁ c testing criteria must be developed to ensure that these aspects are delivered by 
the design.
One issue encountered by service level managers is that the customer has not considered 
the service level requirements and therefore does not know what is required. The customer 
may have detailed and documented functionality requirements (the “what”) but has not 
deﬁ ned the level of service required (the “how”). Service level managers will often draft an 
outline SLR as a starting point for negotiation. This can be a useful approach, focusing the 
customer’s thoughts about what they really need, but it should be ﬂ exible enough to allow 
for requirements to be developed through discussion and negotiation. As stated previously, 
SLM must ensure that clear, objective targets are agreed; if the customer requires the new 
service to be faster than the existing one, how much faster does it have to be? 
Determining what the customer wants is not the same as agreeing to 
deliver the service against the SLRs. It is essential that the service level 
manager confirms that all elements of the service can be delivered to meet 
the required targets. Considerable amount of negotiation may have to take 
place before the emergence of a set of SLRs that both the customer and 
the service provider are happy with. 
Understanding the Service Level 
Agreement
In essence, the SLA describes the service and the quality measures by which the delivery of 
that service will be judged. It is also an opportunity to clarify what is and is not provided. 
In addition to the service provider responsibilities, any customer responsibilities are also 
stated here. 
It is important that the SLA is an actual written agreement, not a vague 
“understanding.” It should be signed by all parties to the agreement, including the service 
provider and the customer. Ensuring that the signatories have the authority to make 
the agreement is important; often the SLM will do all the preparatory work, but the IT 
director actually signs, showing that the commitment is that of the whole department.
The SLA should be written in plain language, with as few technical expressions as 
possible; where these are unavoidable, a glossary should be provided. It is crucial that the 
business users understand what the technical commitments actually mean. If the agreement 
is with an internal service provider, legal terminology is unnecessary and can cause 
confusion.

Understanding the Service Level Agreement 
83
What Does an SLA Contain?
Let’s examine the typical contents of an SLA.
The ﬁ rst essential element in a good SLA is a simple description of the purpose and 
scope of the document so that any reader is clear what the intention is. Typically this might 
consist of a statement such as “This document is the service level agreement between the IT 
department of Company A and the customer department of Company B for the provision 
of (speciﬁ ed) services within the head ofﬁ ce and branch ofﬁ ces of Company B. Provision of 
services to overseas subsidiaries are excluded from this agreement.” Even better is to also 
include a description, in business terms of the service, such as “The (speciﬁ ed) service tracks 
delivery of orders from the warehouse to the end customer using GPS data.”
As with all important documents, it should be clear the period to which the agreement 
applies: “This agreement is valid from January 1, 2012, until December 31, 2012.” Version 
numbers are also essential, if any changes are to be tracked. It is good practice to review 
and reissue SLAs annually, even if there have been no changes. This is to ensure that any 
changes that take place in the service or in the organization are picked up and included in 
the SLA. It is a good idea to deﬁ ne the SLA as a document conﬁ guration item, subject to 
change management.
It is important to make the distinction between the service and the support provided for 
that service and to specify the hours that each of these is available. For example, email may 
be available 24 hours a day, but support may be offered only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
A fault occurring at 6 p.m. will not be responded to until the following day. There should 
be no confusion regarding the support hours, because it will be these hours that are used to 
judge whether an incident response or ﬁ x met the target.
What level of availability and reliability has been agreed on? (We will be looking at 
availability management in more detail in Chapter 6.) Is the level of availability expressed 
in business terms, such as “no more than ﬁ ve breaks, with a total combined downtime of 
two hours in any month,” or in a less meaningful 99.x percent?
The SLA should state what level of throughput is reasonable. If the business decides to 
employ temporary staff to clear a backlog of orders, resulting in twice as many transactions 
per hour, will the service still be guaranteed at the same response time?
The situation regarding any service continuity provision should be stated. This might be 
a target for the return of the service following a disaster or major disruption. However, if 
there is no such plan, this should be stated. “In the event of a major disruption, there is 
no guaranteed target for a return to normal service provision. Service will be restored 
as soon as possible.” In this situation it is permissible to use the expression, “as soon as 
possible” as in the event of a major disruption, which has not been planned for, the IT 
department would do the best they could, but cannot give any guarantees. 
Security aspects of the service should be stated in the SLA. What security is provided 
by the service provider in terms of data protection, encryption, and so on? What are the 
customer responsibilities for safeguarding passwords, or for ensuring unattended screens 
are always locked and so on.
The SLA should state the method used to calculate priority levels for incidents and 
state the target times for incidents to be resolved and requests to be fulﬁ lled. It should be 
clear whether this target applies to all incidents and requests; some service providers are 

84 
Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
unwilling to make commitments that they may not achieve, so they commit to a very 
low service level. Stating in the SLA that the target is, for example, “90 percent of 
all priority-one faults will be resolved within two hours” means that exceptional 
circumstances leading to a short-term drop in service (such as a snowstorm preventing 
engineers from getting to work) will not cause an SLA breach, so the provider is willing to 
commit to a faster response.
Other possible SLA contents would include specifying agreed downtime for maintenance 
and critical business periods when changes would not be applied to the service.
If the service provider charges for providing services, the basis for charging should be 
stated clearly. Is it a charge per head or a charge for particular elements, such as per gigabyte 
of storage, and so on? Is there a rebate if service fails to reach the agreed standard?
Finally, the methods by which the service provision is to be judged should be stated. 
What reporting will be provided? How frequently will service review meetings be held? 
Who will attend?
Building the SLA
As stated earlier, every service provided consists of a number of elements. To make a 
commitment in an SLA, the service level manager must be conﬁ dent that each part of 
that service will be delivered to the required standard. This is achieved by ensuring that 
agreements exist with the internal teams providing elements of the service and that the 
necessary contracts exist with third-party suppliers to underpin those aspects of the service 
provided by external bodies. Taken together, these agreements form the basis of what 
can be promised in the SLA. We are going to look at these different agreements in the 
following pages.
Let’s look ﬁ rst at operational-level agreements (OLAs). These are straightforward 
agreements between internal support departments or other internal departments who are 
supplying an element of the service. Typical commitments might include the hours during 
which support is provided, what level of on-call support is provided, what technology 
each team supports, and what is outside their area of expertise. Commitments to follow 
the agreed processes may also be included, such as a commitment to monitor the queue of 
incidents on the service management tool set at least hourly and to provide regular status 
updates on outstanding incidents.
These agreements should be kept simple, because they are between 
colleagues, not different organizations. The temptation to add legal 
jargon should be resisted; because no team is going to sue the other, 
there is no need for such obfuscation. Technical language is allowable to 
describe areas of expertise, for example, but they should also be explained 
in a glossary if obscure or unclear. Targets should be challenging but 
achievable; setting unrealistic and therefore unattainable targets is 
pointless and will undermine the SLA.

Understanding the Service Level Agreement 
85
OLAs describe the commitments for each IT team; sometimes other internal teams 
involved in providing the overall service may be included (such as ofﬁ ce facilities, the 
training department, and so on). As you have seen, these agreements can be simple and 
are often not more than one or two pages. As with SLAs, the signatories must hold the 
authority to make the commitments contained within the agreement.
A useful tip when trying to understand what OLAs are required for a particular service 
is to use the RACI matrix described in Chapter 7. All those areas where responsibility was 
identiﬁ ed are potential areas for inclusion in an OLA.
As with SLAs, the work does not stop with signing the agreement; the monitoring and 
reporting of OLA performance against the agreed targets is an ongoing SLM responsibility. 
Any deviation from delivering against these targets must be identiﬁ ed and addressed if the 
customer SLA is to be delivered. Failure to deliver against an OLA may cause a breach in 
SLA targets. Simple reporting against OLA targets, showing a rolling 12-month trend, 
will identify any areas at risk of breach or any gradual but continual deterioration. The 
service level manager has to identify and act upon any such issues, taking these up with the 
relevant team manager, possibly as part of an overall service improvement plan (SIP). 
It is recommended that OLAs be reviewed at least annually, or after any major 
reorganization, to ensure that they remain current; they may also be identiﬁ ed as 
conﬁ guration items (CIs), subject to change management. Categorizing OLAs and other 
agreements as CIs ensures that the relationship between a service and its supporting 
agreements is clear and the impact of any changes is fully considered. For more details about 
conﬁ guration items and their relationship to change management, see Chapters 8 and 9.
The second set of agreements that need to be in place to support a service level 
agreement are the underpinning contracts (UCs). These agreements are with the external 
organizations that provide elements of the overall service. Because these suppliers are 
external, these agreements will be contractual and therefore legally enforceable. As with 
OLAs, the service level manager must identify which third parties provide elements of 
the service provided in the SLA and ensure that the targets within the UC are at least 
as demanding as the resolution targets within the SLA. Working with the supplier 
management process, the SLM must ensure that sufﬁ cient monitoring and reporting are 
in place to conﬁ rm that the contracted service is being provided to the required level. 
Typical third-party suppliers might include Internet service providers, hardware and 
software maintainers, and so on. As stated earlier, the contractual nature of UCs will 
mean that the language used in these agreements will often be legalistic; however, it is 
important that the required service targets are clear and unambiguous.
Every commitment in the SLA should be supported by an underpinning agreement, 
either an OLA or a UC.
The underpinning contract may be referred to by the supplier as an SLA; 
however, we call it an underpinning contract to avoid confusion. 

86 
Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between the various agreements.
It is important to understand the difference between an underpinning 
contract (in which an underpinning element of the overall service is 
supplied by an external organization) and an SLA covering a complete 
service provided by a third party, such as an outsourcer (a Type III 
provider). Both are contracts.

Structuring the Agreement
An important decision taken during the planning phase of implementing SLM is to 
decide upon the most suitable SLA structure for the organization. There are three options 
speciﬁ ed by ITIL: customer-based, service-based, and multilevel, each with advantages and 
disadvantages:
■ 
A service-based SLA is one in which each SLA refers to only one service. The service 
described is provided to all users of that service, so the requirements of all customer 
groups need to be ascertained. This option is useful for organization wide services 
such as email. There are disadvantages to this approach, however. The service provided 
across all locations may not be of equal quality, because of network issues, for 
example. Different departments may have differing requirements. This requirement 
can be addressed by agreeing on gold, silver, and bronze service levels within the SLA. 
Difﬁ culties can also arise when trying to identify the appropriate signatory to the 

Understanding the Service Level Agreement 
87
agreement, because the service is provided to many customer groups. An external service 
provider may also use this type of agreement for a standard service in their catalog.
■ 
Another option is to have one agreement covering all the services provided to a single 
customer or customer group. This is called a customer-based SLA. For example, 
the human resources department would have a customer-based SLA, as would the 
ﬁ nance department, and so on. This is straightforward from the customer point of 
view, because all the services they use are in a single agreement. It is also a fairly easy 
to identify the appropriate signatory. From the IT provider’s viewpoint, however, 
 customer-based agreements means that the same service may appear in multiple SLAs, 
which can be difﬁ cult to monitor.
By using a combination of service-based and customer-based SLAs, the service level 
manager can provide a simple framework, covering all services.
■ 
The third option is a multilevel SLA. This option has three levels:
■ 
The corporate level contains information that is applicable to all users across the 
organization. This saves a lot of repetition of this information in every SLA and 
should not need frequent updating.
■ 
The customer level contains information that is applicable only to that particular 
customer, whatever service is being used.
■ 
The service level will contain information on a particular service as it is delivered 
to that particular customer. There may be several of these sections.
The multilevel SLA prevents unnecessary duplication of effort and can be a very effective 
approach. It does require that the SLM understands the relationships between the various 
services and customers (Figure 5.2).

Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
Monitoring and Improving 
Service Delivery
As stated previously, the service level agreement should have clear, objective targets so that 
it can be determined by the business and the IT service provider whether the service was 
delivered as agreed on. To monitor this delivery, the service level manager must produce 
reports that show whether these targets were achieved. Agreeing on the format and 
frequency of the reporting should be included in the service level negotiations. It can be 
difﬁ cult to produce reports that match the customer perception of the service delivered; a 
99.7 percent availability measurement may not match the perception of the service received 
if all the downtime was concentrated on one business area, for example. The SLM must 
strive to produce service metrics that describe, as closely as possible, the level of service 
experienced by the customer rather than technical measurements that mean little or 
nothing to the business.
It is important that the service management tool used by the IT service provider captures 
the required information accurately. The time an incident was logged, responded to, 
resolved, and closed must match what the customer experienced, or else they will become 
cynical and believe that the service provider is “twisting the ﬁ gures.” If the SLA contains 
commitments regarding response times, for example, the service provider must have the 
requisite monitoring tools in place to measure them.
Care should be taken in providing the optimal level of detail; too much 
information swamps the customer in reports, without indicating clearly 
whether a target has been met, but too high level a report may not give the 
detail required.
Reporting and Customer Perception
A desktop support outsourcing company provided its customers with a large report each 
month, containing approximately 50 graphs. Each graph represented the performance 
against targets for a particular category of incident or service request. The level of detail 
provided actually obscured the situation; one graph showed that 100 percent of Type 20 
requests were fulﬁ lled within target but did not show that there had been only one of 
them. Another chart showed that only 85 percent of Type 30 had met their target, again 
not showing the number involved, which could have been several hundred. By produc-
ing this level of reporting, a superﬁ cial analysis appeared to show that the customer was 
receiving an acceptable service. This analysis did not match the customer perception, 
however, and engendered deep cynicism regarding the supplier. Not surprisingly, the 
contract was not renewed.

Monitoring and Improving Service Delivery 
89
In the early days of a new service, reporting may need to be more frequent, possibly 
weekly. As the service stabilizes, these reports can be reduced to monthly. Very well-
established services may be reported upon only quarterly. There is a danger in this, 
however, because any poor service may have persisted for many weeks before coming to the 
attention of the SLM. The reasons for the poor service may be hard to identify after such a 
long period, and poor practice may have become embedded and therefore hard to change. 
The service reports should be reviewed to identify any service that is 
deteriorating gradually, although no targets have been breached as yet. 
The reason for the deterioration should be identified, and action should 
be taken to address the issue so that the service improves and the service 
level target is never breached. This demonstration of a proactive approach 
to service provision confirms to the customer the service provider’s 
commitment to providing a quality service. 
Figure 5.3 shows a simple but effective RAG report, showing achievement against targets 
for six services over an eight-month period.
The use of a simple SLA monitoring chart or SLAM at the start of each 
report, summarizing achievements across all the services, should be 
considered. These are often colored to show all services that comfortably 
met their targets in green, those where the target was under threat but not 
actually breached in amber, and those that failed to meet the targets in red. 
This “traffic-light” system of red, amber, and green is sometimes referred 
to as a RAG report and is very effective in concentrating attention and 
discussion on the services that merit it, rather than plowing through all the 
reports equally.

Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
Measuring customer satisfaction levels is also the responsibility of the service level 
manager. These measurements are more problematic than a straightforward pass or 
fail against a speciﬁ c target. Ensuring that there is a reasonable response to surveys is 
challenging; those who are most unhappy are the most likely to complete a survey. Asking 
every customer to provide feedback every time they have a service provided can prove 
irritating, with the result that the customer marks everything as satisfactory to get rid of 
the survey.
Despite the issues surrounding surveys, measuring satisfaction is useful. For example, 
there may be dissatisfaction at some aspect of service provision, such as unhelpful IT staff, 
even though all other SLA targets have been met. This would otherwise not be apparent. 
Similarly, customer satisfaction may be high following a major incident, because the 
customer appreciated the effort put in by the IT staff to overcome it or were very happy 
with the level of information they were given during the outage, for example.
The SLM should agree with the customer regarding the target satisfaction score 
and monitor and measure achievement against this. Reasons for poor scores should be 
identiﬁ ed, and actions taken, as with any other target.
Reviewing the Service with the Customer
The service level manager should meet regularly with the various customers to review the 
delivery against the service level agreement. The temptation to avoid face-to-face meetings 
by sending copies of the service reports to the customer should be resisted. The regular 
service review meeting between the customer and the service level manager is an important 
opportunity to build a stronger relationship and to increase each party’s understanding of 
the other. Regular meetings will ensure that successes as well as failures are discussed and 
that issues that could be destructive to the relationship are aired and dealt with.
As discussed with regard to service reporting, meetings should be held monthly or at 
least quarterly. It is a good idea to arrange these meetings in advance, for the whole year, so 
that there are no calendar conﬂ icts later that could prevent the meetings from taking place. 
The meetings should have an agreed agenda, and minutes should be taken. Actions should 
be assigned to both the customer and the service level manager, and the progress against 
these should be checked at subsequent meetings.
A standard agenda might contain the following:
■ 
Review of previous minutes and actions
■ 
Review of any major incidents since the last meeting (what caused them, what was the 
impact, how were they handled, what has been done by IT to prevent recurrence)
■ 
Review of service reports for previous month and for a rolling 12-month period
■ 
Discussion of any issues arising from the reports and allocation of actions
■ 
Review of service improvement plan progress against targets
■ 
Discussion of future business developments
■ 
Notiﬁ cation of any IT changes that may affect the service to be delivered

Interfacing with Other Service Management Processes 
91
As a result of the discussions that take place at the service review, it may be decided by 
both parties that the current SLA targets are unsuitable or unachievable. If necessary, the 
SLA would then be renegotiated.
Taking Steps to Improve: The Service Improvement Plan
The issues identiﬁ ed at the service review may be addressed through actions allocated to 
individuals, as discussed earlier. Often the improvement needed is more fundamental than 
this and involves a number of actions by different groups or individuals. In this case, a 
formal service improvement plan (SIP) will be drawn up by the service level manager and 
agreed on at the service review. 
The SIP will have an agreed desired outcome and timescale. Actions will be allocated, 
and progress will be checked. When complete, the results of the SIP will be reviewed 
to ascertain whether the plan has been successful and whether any further actions are 
required. The SLM should undertake the action plan in partnership with the CSI manager. 
The CSI approach, which we cover in detail in Chapter 13, should be the basis of an SIP: 
understanding the vision, baselining the current situation, setting measurable objectives, 
and reviewing the objectives to understand whether the plan has been effective. The plan 
should also be registered in the CSI register (the CSI register is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 13). 
When deciding whether an SIP is required, the SLM should consider the cost of any 
improvement actions and the business beneﬁ t to be achieved.
Interfacing with Other Service 
Management Processes
SLM interfaces with several other processes to ensure agreed service levels are being met:
■ 
Problem management will address the causes of any failures and work to prevent their 
recurrence, thus improving the delivery of the service against targets.
■ 
Availability management works to remove any single points of failure that could lead 
to downtime and addresses the causes of such downtime in order to deliver the highest 
possible level of availability to the customer.
■ 
Capacity management plans ahead to ensure sufﬁ cient capacity is provided and there-
fore preventing service failures that would otherwise have occurred.
■ 
Incident management focuses on resolving incidents and restoring service as quickly 
as possible. Performance against targets for incident resolution is usually a major area 
within an SLA.

92 
Chapter 5 ■ SLM: Aligning IT with Business Requirements
■ 
IT service continuity will plan to ensure that service continues to be provided despite 
major upheavals; where a break in service cannot be prevented, it will work to ensure 
that the service is restored in line with the business requirements.
■ 
Information security ensures that the customer’s data is protected and will work with 
the service level manager to educate the customers and users regarding their own 
responsibilities in this area.
■ 
Supplier management ensures UCs are in place and are being fulﬁ lled.
■ 
Service catalog management provides information about services to support the SLA.
■ 
Financial management provides cost information.
■ 
Design coordination ensures the design meets the SLR.
■ 
SLM works with CSI in designing and implementing the SIP.
■ 
SLM works with business relationship management. However, as stated earlier, BRM 
is more concerned with strategy, identifying customer needs and ensuring the objec-
tives are met.
Summary
This chapter covered the purpose, objectives, and scope of service level management 
and examined the basic concepts, the activities, and the interfaces involved in the process. 
We examined the differences between SLM and business relationship management and 
how these two processes relate to each other.
We examined the different types of service level agreement (the service-based, 
customer-based, and multilevel service level agreements) and covered when each of these 
would be used.
We examined the different types of agreement in service level management: the service 
level agreement (SLA), the operational-level agreement (OLA), and the underpinning 
contract (UC).
We looked at the role of service level requirements and targets and how SLM monitors 
service against these targets, speciﬁ cally the use of the SLAM chart. We also considered the 
purpose of service reviews and service improvement plans.

We have covered the service level management process in some 
detail, but the remaining processes do not require such an in-
depth consideration for the foundation syllabus. As a result, we 
will review only the purpose, objectives, and scope for each process, along with a review of 
the some of the basic process steps and concepts.
Service Catalog Management
This section covers the service catalog management process. We do not look in detail at 
this process, but it is important that you understand its purpose, objectives, and scope. In 
Chapter 3, we covered the service portfolio, which contains the service pipeline and retired 
services, in addition to the service catalog. Figure 6.1 shows these three elements and the 
changing status of the service as it moves from pipeline to catalog to retired services.

Service Catalog Management  
99
Understanding the Service Catalog
A service catalog is deﬁ ned in the ITIL glossary as follows: 
“A database or structured document with information about all live IT 
services, including those available for deployment. The service catalogue 
is part of the service portfolio and contains information about two types 
of IT service: customer-facing services that are visible to the business and 
supporting services required by the service provider to deliver customer-
facing services.”
Let’s examine this deﬁ nition in more detail:
A database or structured document The catalog gathers the service information and pres-
ents it in a form that is easy for the business to understand. 
Information about all live IT services, including those available for deployment The 
catalog contains details of services that are available to the business; in this way, it 
differs from the other components of the service portfolio (the service pipeline and 
retired services). Gathering and maintaining that information is the job of service catalog 
management.
Information about two types of IT service The catalog provides the details that the cus-
tomers require about the services available, namely, deliverables, prices, contact points, 
ordering, and request processes. There is another view of the service catalog—the view that 
is visible only to IT, showing the supporting services that must be in place if the customer 
services are to be delivered. 
These different views of the catalog are similar to what one would expect to see for any 
other type of catalog. For example, a store catalog will show customers the items for sale, 
prices, colors, and speciﬁ cations, and it will give a catalog reference for ordering. The store 
staff would have a different view of the same items, showing stock level, cost price, lead 
time, and supplier. 
As shown in Figure 6.2, the structure should consider the different needs of different 
audiences, because not every service is of interest to every person and not every piece of 
information about a service is of interest to everyone. The customer does not need to see 
the technical aspects of service delivery, and the technicians do not need to see the business 
processes as a regular view.

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Dependent on the nature of the business, the service provider may have both internal 
and external customers and different types of customers, who have different services 
available to them. Figure 6.3 shows a service catalog structure where the catalog deﬁ nes 
services available to wholesale and retail customers.
This catalog has three views:
■ 
The ﬁ rst two views show all the IT services delivered to wholesale or retail custom-
ers (customer-facing services), together with relationships to the customers they 
support.
■ 
The third view shows all the supporting IT services, together with relationships to the 
customer-facing services they underpin. The technical information regarding compo-
nents, CIs, and other supporting services required to support the provision of the ser-
vice to the customers is also shown here.

Service Catalog Management  
101
Purpose of the Service Catalog Management 
Process
The purpose of the service catalog management process is to provide and maintain a single 
source of consistent information on all operational services and those being prepared to 
be run operationally and to ensure that it is readily available to those who are authorized 
to access it. The catalog will include services that are also being developed or enhanced 
for future transition into a live environment, from pipeline to operations to retirement. It 
is an essential resource for service management, so the production and maintenance of the 
information are extremely important.
The catalog will be used by customers and IT and for the basis for service level (ITIL 
core guidance does not hyphenate service level) management. Identifying and documenting 
all the services provided, together with their supporting services, are challenging tasks, but 
the advantages of having one agreed, deﬁ nitive source for this information make the effort 
worthwhile.

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Objectives of the Service Catalog 
Management Process
The service catalog management process has as its objective the production and 
maintenance of the service catalog. The information contained within the catalog must be 
accurate, so there should be a link to service transition. As service transition moves new 
services to the operational environment or retires other services, the service catalog will 
need to be updated to reﬂ ect the changes. To ensure consistency, the service description 
should remain the same as the service progresses through the portfolio to avoid any 
confusion with other, similar services.
Effective service asset and conﬁ guration management will ensure that the supporting 
services for each customer-facing service that is run, or is being prepared to run, in the 
live environment are identiﬁ ed and documented in the catalog. The details of the service, 
its status, its interfaces, and its dependencies should all be held within the service 
catalog.
A further objective of service catalog management is to ensure that the information 
within the catalog is made available in a suitable format to those who need it. Whether this 
is a Word document, a spreadsheet, or an intranet site, the needs of the customers and users 
should be considered. Appropriate controls should be put in place to control access to those 
approved to see that level of detail.
The service catalog information is used by other service management processes; an 
objective of service catalog management is to ensure that the information provided within 
it meets the requirements of all who access it. Working with service asset and conﬁ guration 
management, the dependencies within components can be identiﬁ ed and shown.
Scope of the Service Catalog Management Process
The scope of the service catalog management process includes all services that are being 
transitioned or have been transitioned to the live environment. The catalog may list services 
individually; more commonly, it describes service packages. A service package is an offering 
that combines two or more services to offer a solution to a speciﬁ c customer need or 
business outcome. It may consist of a combination of core services, enabling services and 
enhancing services. 
Included within the scope of this process is the deﬁ nition of these services or service 
packages and the descriptions to be used for them within the catalog. Also included is 
the actual production and ongoing maintenance of the catalog, showing the dependencies 
between all services and supporting services. This information is obtained from the 
Conﬁ guration Management System. We shall be examining the CMS in Chapter 9.
Although the service catalog may describe the services that can be 
requested, the fulfillment of them is outside the scope of this process and 
belongs in request fulfillment or the overall change management process.

Availability Management  
103
Availability Management
The availability of a service is critical to its value. No matter how clever it is or what 
functionality it offers (its utility), the service is of no value to the customer unless it delivers 
the warranty expected. Poor availability is a primary cause of customer dissatisfaction. 
Availability is one of the four warranty aspects that must be delivered if the service is to 
be ﬁ t for use. Targets for availability are often included in service level agreements, so the 
IT service provider must understand the factors to be considered when seeking to meet 
or exceed the availability target. This section covers how availability is measured; the 
purpose, objectives, and scope of availability management; and a number of key concepts.
Defining Availability
ITIL deﬁ nes availability as the ability of an IT service or other conﬁ guration item to 
perform its agreed function when required. Any unplanned interruption to a service during 
its agreed service hours (also called the agreed service time, speciﬁ ed in the service level 
agreement) is deﬁ ned as downtime. The availability measure is calculated by taking the 
downtime from the agreed service time as a percentage of the total agreed time. 
 It is important to note the inclusion of when required in the deﬁ nition and the word 
agreed in the calculation. The service may be available when the customer does not require 
it; including this time in the calculation gives a false impression of the availability from the 
customer perspective. If customer perception does not match the reporting provided, 
the customer will become cynical and distrust the reports provided (see Chapter 5).
Calculating Availability: Two Examples
Example A: A service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. One hour of downtime 
per week is calculated as follows:
 168 hours – 1 hour downtime = 167/168 × 100 = 99.4% availability
Example B: If the service is available but used only 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday 
(and these 40 hours are the service hours agreed in the SLA), then the same one hour of 
downtime results in a different ﬁ gure:
40 hours – 1 hour downtime = 39/40 × 100 = 97.5% availability
Availability (%) 
Agreed service time (AST) - downtime
AST
∗100
If the downtime occurred overnight, it would be included in the calculations in Example A 
but not those in Example B, because there was no agreed service after 5 p.m.
It is important therefore to agree on exactly what the agreed service hours are; they should 
be documented in the SLA. The basis for the calculation should be clear to the customer.

104 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Keep in mind that the customer experiences the end-to-end service; the availability 
delivered depends on all links in the chain being operational when required. The customer 
will complain that a service is unavailable whether the fault is with the application, the 
network, or the hardware. The availability management process is therefore concerned 
with reducing service-affecting downtime wherever it occurs. Again, it should be clearly 
stated in the availability reports whether the calculations are based on the end-to-end 
service or just the application availability. It is therefore essential to understand the 
difference between service availability and component availability.
Purpose of Availability Management
The purpose of the availability management process is to take the necessary steps to deliver 
the availability requirements deﬁ ned in the SLA. The process should consider both the 
current requirements and the future needs of the business. All actions taken to improve 
availability have an accompanying cost, so all improvements made must be assessed for 
cost-effectiveness.
Availability management considers all aspects of IT service provision to identify possible 
improvements to availability. Some improvements will be dependent on implementing new 
technology; others will result from more effective use of staff resources or streamlined 
processes. Availability management analyzes reasons for downtime and assesses the return 
on investment for improvements to ensure the most cost-effective measures are taken. The 
process ensures that the delivery of the agreed availability is prioritized across all phases of 
the lifecycle.
Objectives of Availability Management
The objectives of availability management include the following:
■ 
Producing and maintaining a plan that details how the current and future availability 
requirements are to be met. This plan should consider requirements 12 to 24 months in 
advance to ensure that any necessary expenditure is agreed on in the annual budget nego-
tiations and any new equipment is bought and installed before the availability is affected. 
The plan should be revised regularly to take account of any changes in the business.
■ 
Providing advice throughout the service lifecycle on all availability-related issues to 
both the business and IT, ensuring that the impact of any decisions on availability is 
considered. 
■ 
Managing the delivery of services to meet the agreed targets. Where downtime has 
occurred, availability management will assist in resolving the underlying problem, 
utilizing the problem management process.
■ 
Assessing all requests for change to ensure that any potential risk to availability has 
been considered. Any updates to the availability plan required as a result of changes 
will also be considered and implemented.
■ 
Considering all possible proactive steps that could be taken to improve availabil-
ity across the end-to-end service, assessing the risk and potential beneﬁ ts of these 
improvements, and implementing them where justiﬁ ed.

Availability Management  
105
■ 
Implementing monitoring of availability to ensure that targets are being achieved.
■ 
Optimizing all areas of IT service provision to deliver the required availability consist-
ently to enable the business to use the services provided to achieve its objectives. 
Scope of Availability Management
As discussed, the availability management process encompasses all phases of the service 
lifecycle. It is included in the design phase, because the most effective way to deliver 
availability is to ensure that availability considerations are designed in from the start. 
Once the service is operational, opportunities are continually sought to remove risks 
to availability and make the service more robust. These activities are part of proactive 
availability management. Throughout the live delivery of the service, availability 
management analyzes any downtime and implements measures to reduce the frequency 
and length of any future occurrences. These are the reactive activities of availability 
management. Changes to live services are assessed to understand any risks to the service, 
and measurements are put in place to ensure that downtime is measured accurately. This 
continues throughout the operation phase until the service is retired.
The scope of availability management includes all operational services and technology. 
Where SLAs are in place, there will be clear, agreed targets. There may be other services, 
however, where no formal SLA exists but where downtime has a signiﬁ cant business 
impact. Availability management should not exclude these services from consideration; it 
should strive to achieve high availability in line with the potential impact on the business 
of downtime. Service level management should work to negotiate SLAs for all such services 
in the future, because without them, it is the IT service provider who is assessing the level 
of availability required when this is a business decision. Availability management should 
be applied to all new IT services and for existing services where SLRs or SLAs have been 
established. Supporting services must be included, because the failures of these services 
impact the customer-facing services. Availability management may also work with supplier 
management to ensure that the level of service provided by partners does not threaten the 
overall service availability.
Every aspect of service provision comes within the scope of availability management; 
poor processes, untrained staff, or ineffective tools can all contribute to causing or 
unnecessarily prolonging downtime. 
Understanding the Effect of Downtime 
on Vital Business Functions 
Availability management must align its activities and priorities to the requirements of 
the business. This requires a ﬁ rm understanding of the business processes and how they 
are underpinned by the IT service. Information regarding the future business plans and 
priorities and therefore the future requirements of the business with regard to availability 
is essential input to the availability plan. Only with this understanding of the business 
requirement can the service provider be sure that their efforts to improve availability are 
correctly targeted.

106 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
The response of the IT service provider to failure can improve the customer’s perception 
of the service, despite the break in service. The service provider’s actions can show 
an understanding of the impact of the downtime on the business processes, and an 
eagerness to overcome the issue and prevent recurrences can reassure the business that IT 
understands its needs.
Additionally, the process requires a strong technical understanding of the individual 
components that make up each service, their capabilities, and their current performance. 
Through this combination of business understanding and technical knowledge, the optimal 
design can be delivered to produce the required level of availability to meet current and 
future needs.
When designing a new service and discussing its availability requirements, the service 
provider and the business must focus on the criticality of the service to the business being 
able to achieve its aims. Expenditure to provide high availability across every aspect of a 
service is unlikely to be justiﬁ ed. The business process that the IT service supports may be 
a vital business function (VBF), and identifying which services or parts of services are the 
most critical is therefore a business decision. For example, the ability for an Internet-based 
bookshop to be able to process credit card payments would be a vital business function. 
The ability to display a “customers who bought this book also bought these other books” 
feature is not vital. It may encourage some increased sales, but the purchaser is able to 
complete their purchase without it. Once these VBFs are understood, the design of the 
service to ensure the required availability can commence. Understanding the VBFs informs 
decisions regarding where expenditure to protect availability is justiﬁ ed.
It is a business, not an IT decision, what the appropriate availability target of a service 
should be. However, availability comes at a price, and the service provider must ensure 
that the customer understands the cost implications of too high a target. Customers may 
otherwise demand a very high availability target (99.99% or greater) and then ﬁ nd the service 
unaffordable. 
Where very high availability is cost-justiﬁ ed, the design of the service will include highly 
reliable components, a resilient design, and minimal or no planed downtime.
Having considered the importance of availability to the business, in the following 
section we examine some of the key availability management activities and concepts 
that the IT service provider may employ to cut downtime and thus deliver the required 
availability to the business, enabling it to achieve its business objectives. 
Improving Availability
Availability management is comprised of both reactive and proactive activities, as shown 
in Figure 6.4. The reactive activities include regular monitoring of service provision 
involving extensive data gathering and reporting of the performance of individual 
components and processes and the availability delivered by them. Event management is 
often used to monitor components because this speeds up the identiﬁ cation of any issues 
through the setting of alert thresholds. It may even be possible to restart the failing 
service automatically, possibly before the break has been noticed by the customers. (Event 
management is discussed in detail in Chapter 12.) Instances of downtime are investigated, 

Availability Management  
107
and remedial actions are taken to prevent a recurrence. The proactive activities include 
identifying and managing risks to the availability of the service and implementing measures 
to protect against such an occurrence. Where protective measures have been put in place 
to provide resilience in the event of component failure, the measures require regular testing 
to ensure that they actually work as designed to protect the service availability. All new 
or changed services should be subject to continual service improvement; countermeasures 
should be implemented wherever they can be cost-justiﬁ ed. This cost justiﬁ cation requires 
an understanding of the vital business functions and the cost to the business of any 
downtime. It is ultimately a business, not a technical decision. Figure 6.4 also shows the 
availability management information system; this is the repository for all availability 
management reports, plans, risk registers, and so on, and it forms part of the service 
knowledge management system (SKMS).

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
The ﬁ rst availability concept we cover is reliability. This is deﬁ ned by ITIL as “a 
measure of how long a service, component, or CI can perform its agreed function without 
interruption.” We normally describe how reliable an item is by stating how frequently it 
can be expected to break down within a given time: “My car is very reliable. It has broken 
down only twice in ﬁ ve years.” We measure reliability by calculating the mean (or average) 
time between failures (MTBF) or the mean (or average) time between service incidents 
(MTBSI).
Business continuity management and IT service continuity management 
are outside the scope of availability management. There is a strong 
relationship between availability management and these processes, 
however, because every action taken to mitigate a risk to availability or to 
provide resilience will support ITSCM.
MTBF is measured from when the configuration item starts working until it 
next fails. It is therefore a measure of uptime.
MTBSI is measured from when a system or IT service fails until it next 
fails. It therefore includes both the MTBF and the time taken to restore the 
service.
Reliability of a service can be improved ﬁ rst by ensuring the components speciﬁ ed in 
the design are of good quality and from a supplier with a good reputation. Even the best 
components will fail eventually; however, the reliability of the service can be improved 
by designing the service so that a component failure does not result in downtime. This is 
another availability concept called resilience. By ensuring the design includes alternate 
network routes, for example, a network component failure will not lead to service 
downtime, because the trafﬁ c will reroute. Carrying out planned maintenance to ensure 
that all the components are kept in good working order will also help improve reliability.
Resilience Through Redundancy
A good example of designing in resilience is that of a modern passenger aircraft. Although 
the engines are designed to be very reliable, with a long MTBF, an aircraft with a single 
engine could still suffer catastrophic failure if that engine developed a fault midﬂ ight. 
Aircraft are therefore designed to have several engines and to be able to ﬂ y and land with 
only one of these operational. This availability management approach delivers resilience 
by providing redundancy (the use of one or more additional conﬁ guration items to provide 
fault tolerance).

Availability Management  
109
However reliable the equipment and resilient the design, not all downtime can be 
prevented. When a fault occurs and there is insufﬁ cient resilience in the design to prevent 
it from affecting the service, the length of the downtime that results can be affected by 
how quickly the fault can be overcome. This is called maintainability and is measured 
as the mean time to restore service (MTRS). It may be more cost-effective to concentrate 
resilience measures for those items that have a long service restoration time. To calculate 
MTRS, divide the total downtime by the total number of failures.
Calculating MTRS
A service suffers four failures in a month. The duration of each was 1 hour, 2 hours, 1.2 
hours, and 1.8 hours, resulting in a total downtime of 6 hours.
MTRS = 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 hours
Maintainability (MTRS in hours) 
Total downtime in hours
Number of service breaks
Simple measures can be taken to reduce MTRS, such as having common spares available 
on site, and these measures can have a signiﬁ cant impact on availability.
ITIL recommends the use of MTRS, rather than Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), 
because this may or may not include the restoration of the service following the repair. 
From the customer perspective, downtime includes all the time between the fault occurring 
and the service being fully able to be used again. MTRS measures this complete time and is 
therefore a more meaningful measurement.
These concepts are illustrated in Figure 6.5, which shows what ITIL calls the expanded 
incident lifecycle. This shows periods of uptime, with incidents causing periods of 
downtime. MTRS is shown as the average of the downtime. MTBF is shown as the average 
of the uptime.
Each incident needs to be detected, diagnosed, and repaired, and the data needs 
to be recovered and the service restored. Any method of shortening any of these 
steps—speeding up detection through event management or speeding up diagnosis by the 
use of a knowledge base, for example—will shorten the downtime and improve availability. 
The ﬁ gure also shows another concept, that of MTBSI; this calculates the average time 
from the start of one incident to the start of the next. Understanding MTBSI is not required 
for the examination.

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Serviceability
Serviceability is deﬁ ned as the ability of a third-party supplier to meet the terms of 
its contract. This contract will include agreed levels of availability, reliability, and/or 
maintainability for a supporting service or component.
Availability Concepts: Reliability and Serviceability
A large bakery had used a machine for making bread rolls for 15 years without any down-
time. This machine was responsible for the production of all the bread rolls for a major fast-
food company and was therefore very important to the business. The long period without 
failure showed that the machine was very reliable, possibly because of a resilient design. 
One day it failed. Because it had never failed before, there was consternation; there was no 
procedure in place for such an occurrence. Eventually a manual was located, which was 
in German. After tracking down the manufacturer in Germany (this was in the days before 
Google), a call was placed with them to send an engineer. He arrived the following day 
(exactly two days since the fault occurred) and ﬁ xed the machine in 15 minutes. The mean 
time to repair was therefore short (15 minutes), but the mean time to restore service was 2 
days and 15 minutes, which had a major impact on the ability of the company to satisfy its 
external customer, the fast-food chain. The weakness here was in the serviceability of the 
machine; there was no contract in place to ensure a response and ﬁ x in an appropriate time.

Information Security Management  
111
Information Security Management
Another of the key warranty aspects of a service is security, and it is this aspect that we 
will discuss in this section. A service that is insecure will not deliver value to the customer 
and indeed may not be used by them at all.
ITIL deﬁ nes information security as “the management process within the corporate 
governance framework, which provides the strategic direction for security activities and 
ensures objectives are achieved.” 
Central to information security management (ISM) is the identiﬁ cation and mitigation 
of risks to the security of the organization’s information. The ISM process ensures that all 
security aspects are considered and managed throughout the service lifecycle.
Information includes data stores, databases, and metadata (metadata is 
the term applied to a set of data describing and giving information about 
other data).
Organizations operate under an overall corporate governance framework, and 
information security management forms part of this framework. As with wide governance, 
ISM provides guidance as to what is required, ensuring risks are managed and the 
objectives of the organization are achieved.
Purpose, Objectives, and Scope of Information 
Security Management 
The purpose of the information security management process is to ensure that IT security 
meets the requirements of the overall business security. It is responsible for making sure 
that the information, data, and IT services used by the organization are protected to the 
appropriate level. Information must be kept conﬁ dential, that is, made available only to 
those with the appropriate access rights. The data must be protected from any corruption 
or unauthorized alteration so that its integrity is assured. Finally, the information must be 
available to authorized users when required through robust systems that are resistant to 
failure. By ensuring these aspects—conﬁ dentiality, integrity, and availability—ISM enables 
the business to meet its objectives.
Where information is transmitted between partner organizations, ISM must ensure that 
this exchange is protected so that the information can be trusted.
ITIL deﬁ nes the objective of information security management (ISM) as “to protect 
the interests of those relying on information, and the systems and communications that 
deliver the information, from harm resulting from failures of conﬁ dentiality, integrity, and 
availability.”

112 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
The scope of ISM includes all aspects of information security that are important to the 
business. It is the responsibility of the business to deﬁ ne what requires protection and how 
strong this protection should be. Risks to security must be recognized, and appropriate 
countermeasures should be implemented. These may include physical (restricting access to 
secure areas through swipe cards) as well as technical aspects (password policies, use of 
biometrics, and so on). Information security is an integral part of corporate governance.
Producing an Information Security Policy
The information security management process is responsible for producing and 
maintaining an information security policy. This document should be made available to 
all IT staff, customers, and users. It is also part of ISM to ensure that the policy is being 
carried out, for example, by performing spot checks. 
To produce such a policy, the IT security manager must have a thorough understanding 
of all security issues within the organization. This must include an understanding of the 
overall business security policy and requirements, its current and future plans, how these 
might impact security, and any risks to security (either business risks or IT risks), including 
how these risks are being managed). Any particular legal or regulatory requirements should 
also be included. For example, an organization that handles online credit-card payments will 
be subject to particular regulations to ensure that the transactions are adequately protected.
Information security management activities should be focused on and driven by an 
overall information security policy and a set of underpinning speciﬁ c security policies. The 
information security policy should have the full support of top executive IT management 
and ideally the support and commitment of top executive business management. The policy 
should cover all areas of security and be appropriate to meet the needs of the business; 
speciﬁ cally, it should include the following:
■ 
Use and misuse of IT assets policy
■ 
An access control policy
■ 
A password control policy
■ 
An email policy
■ 
An Internet policy
■ 
An antivirus policy
■ 
An information classiﬁ cation policy
■ 
A document classiﬁ cation policy
■ 
A remote access policy
■ 
A policy with regard to supplier access to IT service, information, and components
■ 
A copyright infringement policy for electronic material
■ 
An asset disposal policy
■ 
A records retention policy

Information Security Management  
113
In most cases, these policies should be widely available to all customers and users, and 
their compliance should be referred to in all SLRs, SLAs, OLAs, underpinning contracts, 
and agreements. They are stored in the security management information system (SMIS), 
as shown in Figure 6.6. The SMIS forms part of the overall service knowledge management 
system (SKMS).
Educating Staff About Security
The information security management process includes producing the information security 
policy and publicizing its contents. The process also involves working with the business 
to understand current and future needs in this area. Implementing appropriate protective 
measures and controls to manage the identiﬁ ed risks and ensuring that these measures are 
documented and maintained are ongoing aspects of this process.

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
The information security manager must ensure that controls are in place to manage 
the access to secure systems by third-party suppliers and ensure that faulty or obsolete 
hardware is not scrapped without removing the data held within it. Staff members must 
be made aware of their responsibilities with regard to protecting data (carrying data on 
unencrypted ﬂ ash drives, sharing passwords, and so on); where a breach does occur, this 
should be used as an opportunity to reevaluate the existing policy for effectiveness.
For security to be effective, it must not be considered as an additional aspect but as 
integral to the design and operation of all services and across all ITSM processes. Security 
is an ongoing process; the information security manager should be constantly reviewing 
possible threats and taking the necessary steps to protect the organization’s data. More 
security breaches occur as a result of lack of awareness than by deliberate action. The 
information security manager must continually emphasize the importance of adhering to 
the policy and be proactively seeking to improve security and reduce risk.
The information security policies should be authorized by senior management as they 
form an important part of overall governance. These business managers should emphasize 
the importance of adhering to the policies and ensure that all staff members are aware of 
what the policies are. Publicizing the policies through presentations, notices, posters, and 
so on, will help get the message across. There should be no scope for a staff member to 
argue that they did not know what the policy was. Should deliberate ﬂ outing of the policies 
take place, it is essential that these are taken seriously, with appropriate disciplinary 
measures enacted.
The nature of security threats changes with new technology; many organizations now 
have policies on downloading music or access to Facebook that would not have been 
necessary a few years ago. It is essential that the security policies keep in step with the new 
threats. All security policies should therefore be formally reviewed—and when necessary 
revised—at least every 12 months.
Supplier Management
In Chapter 5, we examined the contribution to the service made by external suppliers. The 
agreements that govern what level of service is provided by these third-party suppliers are 
called underpinning contracts. As we saw in that discussion, failure by a supplier may 
result in an impact on the service that the service provider delivers to their customer. 
Large service providers may have dozens or even hundreds of supplier contracts. The 
elements of the service that these contracts provide are often critical to the overall service 
delivery. It is essential, therefore, that the service provider obtains the level of service 
speciﬁ ed in the underpinning contract and is sure that the contracts it has with its suppliers 
represent “value for money.”  
ITIL deﬁ nes supplier management as the process responsible for obtaining value for 
money from suppliers, ensuring that all contracts and agreements with suppliers support 
the needs of the business and that all suppliers meet their contractual commitments. 

Supplier Management  
115
The supplier management process describes best practices in managing suppliers to 
ensure that the services they provide meet expectations. It is included in the design phase of 
the service lifecycle, because it is important that this aspect is considered while the service 
is being designed. The type of supplier relationship will be part of the strategy phase, 
and a close relationship with suppliers will be required for a successful service transition. 
Once the service is operational, the day-to-day delivery against the contract must be 
monitored and managed, and should there be any issues, the improvement plan will be the 
responsibility of continual service improvement.
The Purpose and Objectives of Supplier Management 
The purpose of supplier management is to ensure that suppliers provide value for money. 
By managing suppliers, the service provider can ensure the best delivery of service to their 
customer. Managing suppliers ensures that the necessary contracts are in place and enforced.
Ensuring that suppliers deliver the service paid for is a key objective of this process. It 
also ensures that the cost of the contract is controlled, by using objective selection criteria 
when choosing these suppliers.
Care must be taken to ensure that the terms of the contract are in alignment with the 
business requirement and underpin the service level targets. 
Supplier Management in Action
An internal service provider had agreed on an SLA target of an eight-hour ﬁ x for hard-
ware faults. The contract with its supplier speciﬁ ed a 12-hour ﬁ x. To ensure that the SLA 
targets were met, the service provider had to send his own staff to swap out faulty equip-
ment within the eight-hour target. This equipment then was repaired by the supplier. This 
arrangement meant that the service provider was paying for a service that did not match 
the business requirement and therefore had to duplicate the service he was paying for, by 
using his own staff. When the contract came up for renewal, the supplier manager sug-
gested one of three alternatives:
■ 
Renegotiate the SLA with the customer to be a 12-hour ﬁ x, thus aligning the business 
requirement with the contract and removing the need for the service provider’s own 
staff to swap out the equipment.
■ 
Renegotiate the contract with the supplier to be an eight-hour ﬁ x, again aligning the 
business requirement with the contract and removing the need for the service pro-
vider’s own staff to swap out the equipment.
■ 
Renegotiate or replace the contract with a much cheaper service, where faulty equip-
ment is picked up weekly, repaired, and returned. Once the equipment was swapped 
out, it made little sense to have the supplier on a 12-hour ﬁ x, because the business 
requirement for an 8-hour ﬁ x had already been met.

116 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Supplier management is involved in selecting suppliers and agreeing to the terms of 
the contracts. It is also responsible for the ongoing relationship with suppliers, including 
monitoring and managing their performance through regular reviews. These reviews are very 
similar to SLA reviews, but in supplier management the service provider is the customer.
Supplier management will draw up a supplier policy and keep all the information 
regarding suppliers and contracts in a supplier and contract management information system 
(SCMIS). The SCMIS forms part of the overall service knowledge management system.
What Is Covered by Supplier Management?
Supplier management’s scope includes all the suppliers and contracts that are required in 
order to deliver the service to the provider’s customer. It is important to identify which 
suppliers are particularly critical in delivering the service and ensure that they receive the 
appropriate attention. Some such suppliers will provide a critical element, such as network 
connectivity. Other suppliers may not appear to be as critical, but they may provide 
elements of several services, so the combined impact of poor service across several services 
could be extremely detrimental. 
Many suppliers can be managed at the operational level, with service reports and 
reviews to ensure that they are delivering to the contract. Key suppliers will work closely 
with the business and the service provider, understanding and supporting the business and 
service strategy. We will look in more depth at different categories of supplier later. 
As shown in Figure 6.7, the process includes categorizing suppliers and assessing and 
managing any risks that are identiﬁ ed. (The decision to award a contract to a new, untried 
supplier may result in a risk that the supplier may not be able to fulﬁ ll the contract, for 
example.) The selection of suppliers, following an objective assessment, and the negotiation 
of the contract are also included.
During the lifetime of the contract, supplier management will manage the supplier 
performance and any disputes that arise and will renew or terminate the contract at the end 
of its term, as appropriate. Where improvements need to be made, supplier management 
will identify them and ensure that they are entered in the continual service improvement 
register. (For more details on the CSI register, see Chapter 13.)
As part of the overall process, supplier management will draw up standard terms and 
conditions and contract templates. There will also be a supplier policy document that is 
produced and maintained as part of this process. Supplier management information is kept 
in the SCMIS. Throughout the process, the supplier manager will work within the overall 
ﬁ nancial and procurement framework in place within the organization.
Supplier Categorization
As discussed, some suppliers are more important than others. Some offer a specialized 
service and would be hard to replace. In some cases, the technical strategy of the service 
provider is largely dependent on the technical developments delivered by a particular 
supplier. Other suppliers provide standard services and could be replaced with little or no 
impact on the business, should another supplier offering better value be found.

Supplier Management  
117
It is an essential part of supplier management to devise a method of categorizing 
suppliers so that the appropriate time and attention is allocated to each—key suppliers are 
prioritized over less important ones. One of the best ways of categorizing suppliers is based 
on assessing the risk and impact from using the supplier and the value and importance 
of its services to the business. As shown in Figure 6.8, this assessment results in suppliers 
being assessed as strategic, tactical, operational, or commodity suppliers.

Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
■ 
Suppliers who are assessed as high value and high risk are strategic suppliers. The rela-
tionship between the business and a strategic supplier is one of “partnering.” Both par-
ties share conﬁ dential information to enable long-term cooperation to take place. These 
relationships are key to achieving the business objectives and, as such, will be managed 
by senior levels of management through regular meetings, strategy discussions, and 
improvement plans. An example of a strategic supplier may be one that is providing 
cutting-edge technology to provide its customer with a competitive advantage. For the 
customer to develop the new product, the supplier may need to provide information 
that it would normally keep conﬁ dential, such as the strategy for developing the tech-
nology. The customer similarly shares information regarding their strategy and plans. 
This cooperation enables the customer to beneﬁ t from new products before they are 
announced, and the supplier beneﬁ ts from having a real case study of the new technol-
ogy in use to use as marketing material when the product is launched.

Capacity Management  
119
■ 
Suppliers assessed as medium value and medium risk are tactical suppliers. The rela-
tionship with them, although not as critical as with strategic suppliers, involves sig-
niﬁ cant commercial activity. Middle-level managers will be responsible for managing 
these relationships through regular service reviews. Examples of this kind of supplier 
might include a server hardware maintenance organization. 
■ 
Operational suppliers are managed by junior managers through regular reviews. Fail-
ure by these suppliers would have relatively low impact. An example of such a supplier 
might be a PC or printer repair service. 
■ 
Low-value, low-risk suppliers of standard services, which can be easily sourced else-
where, are commodity suppliers (for example, paper or toner suppliers). These require 
little management; a supplier that fails to meet the contract will be replaced by another 
that can.
From this, you can see that supplier management must have a clear understanding of 
how each supplier’s services underpin both the SLA and the overall business objectives. 
Sufﬁ cient time and attention must be given to the more important suppliers, with little time 
wasted on the least important. With many organizations outsourcing elements of their 
service provision, the role of managing suppliers effectively has never been more essential.
Capacity Management
One of the responsibilities of the service provider is to ensure that the service is able to cope 
with the demands put upon it. If the design is not able to cope, the service will fail to meet 
the performance speciﬁ ed in the SLA. In addition, the service must be designed to meet 
not only the requirements for today; it must anticipate future requirements and be able to 
meet them, too. Overspecifying the design would ensure that it could meet future demands; 
however, this may result in wasted expenditure if the actual demand does not come close to 
the capabilities of the design.
ITIL states that capacity management is responsible for ensuring that the capacity of 
IT services and the IT infrastructure is able to meet agreed current and future capacity 
and performance needs in a cost-effective and timely manner. The capacity management 
process has therefore to understand the likely changes in capacity requirements and ensure 
that the design and ongoing management of the service meet this demand. Delivering 
sufﬁ cient capacity is a key warranty aspect of a service that needs to be delivered if the 
beneﬁ ts of the service are to be realized.
Capacity management is considered throughout the lifecycle; as part of strategy, 
the likely capacity requirements for a new service are considered as part of the service 
evaluation to ensure that the service is meeting a real need. In design, the service is 
engineered to cope with that demand and to be ﬂ exible enough to be able to adjust to meet 
changing capacity requirements. Transition ensures that the service, when implemented, 

120 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
is delivering according to its speciﬁ cation. The operational phase of the lifecycle ensures 
that day-to-day adjustments that are necessary to meet changes in requirements are 
implemented. Finally, as part of continual service improvement, capacity-related issues are 
addressed, and adjustments are made to ensure the most cost-effective and reliable delivery 
of the service is achieved.
Delivering What Is Required, When It Is Required
The purpose of the capacity management process is to understand the current and future 
capacity needs of the service and to ensure that the service and its supporting services are 
able to deliver to this level. The actual capacity requirements will have been agreed upon as 
part of service level management; capacity management must not only meet these but also 
ensure that the future needs of the business, which may change over time, are also met. An 
essential objective is to deliver any increased capacity in time so that the business is not 
impacted.
The objectives of capacity management are met by the development of a detailed 
plan that states the current business requirement, the expected future requirement, and 
the actions that will be taken to meet these requirements. This plan should be reviewed 
and updated at regular intervals (at least annually) to ensure that changes in business 
requirements are considered. Similarly, any requests to change the current conﬁ guration 
will be considered by capacity management to ensure that they are in line with expectations 
or, if not, that the capacity plan is amended to suit the changed requirement. Those 
responsible for capacity management will review any issues that arise and help resolve any 
incidents or problems that are the result of insufﬁ cient capacity. This helps ensure that the 
service meets its objectives. 
As part of the ongoing management of capacity and its continual improvement, any 
proactive measures that may improve performance at a reasonable cost are identiﬁ ed and 
acted upon. Advice and guidance on capacity and performance-related issues is provided, 
and assistance is given to service operations with performance and capacity-related 
incidents and problems. 
What Should Capacity Management Include?
The capacity management process has responsibility for ensuring sufﬁ cient capacity at all 
times, including both planning for short-term ﬂ uctuations, such as that caused by seasonal 
variations, and ensuring that the required capacity is there for longer-term business 
expansion. Changes in demand may sometimes actually be reductions in that demand, and 
this is also within the scope of the process. Capacity management should ensure that as 
demand for the service falls, the capacity provided for that service is also reduced to ensure 
unnecessary expenditure is avoided. 
The process includes all aspects of service provision and therefore may involve the 
technical, applications, and operations management functions. Other aspects of capacity, 
such as staff resources, are also considered.

Capacity Management  
121
As this example illustrates, an increase in capacity requirements may have repercussions 
across the infrastructure and on the IT staff resources required to manage it. Although 
stafﬁ ng is a line management responsibility, the calculation of resource requirements in this 
area is also part of the overall capacity management process.
Capacity management also involves monitoring “patterns of business activity” to 
understand how well the infrastructure is meeting the demands upon it and making 
adjustments as required to ensure that the demand is met. Proactive improvements to 
capacity may also be implemented, where justiﬁ ed, and any incidents caused by capacity 
issues need to be investigated. 
Capacity management may also recommend demand management techniques to smooth 
out excessive peaks in demand.
Capacity Management in Action
A retail organization that was struggling to maintain its market position decided to 
expand its online and telephone-ordering service through a major marketing cam-
paign. As part of this initiative, the telephone-ordering service hours were planned to 
be extended to 24 hours, 7 days a week. The business was considering what this would 
mean in terms of increased call-center staff, warehouse staff, and stock levels. The IT 
director was tasked with ensuring that the IT services would support this business 
initiative.
The IT director called together his managers involved in the capacity management pro-
cess. Those in the technical management function had to ensure that the infrastructure 
would be able to cope with the expected increased demand. This included ensuring 
the telecoms infrastructure capacity required for the extra call-center staff and the 
voice trafﬁ c that the staff would generate in addition to the increase in data trafﬁ c. 
The website’s capacity to handle increased trafﬁ c and the ability of the applications to 
handle a high volume of orders, credit-card processing, and so on, were investigated 
by the technical and applications management functions. The technical solutions that 
were recommended as a result meant more equipment would be purchased. The opera-
tions management function investigated the impact on operational processes, such 
as increased time needed to carry out backups and the impact of 24/7 operations on 
planned maintenance. Included was the impact on the UPS, air conditioning, and so 
on, of the extra equipment. Finally, the service desk manager calculated what increase 
in staff would be required to move to a 24/7 support operation and an increased user 
population during peak hours. This was calculated as requiring two new service desk 
analysts, and the building services department was asked to provide the extra ofﬁ ce 
space for the new staff.

122 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
The Capacity Management Subprocesses
To draw up the capacity plan, you must understand the future requirements of the 
business. Business capacity management is therefore a subprocess of the overall capacity 
management process. Its aim is to calculate what the business plans and forecast mean for 
the infrastructure. Business plans to expand (perhaps by buying smaller competitors) or 
launch a new service, offshore a call center, or outsource a function will all have an impact 
on capacity requirements. Capacity management has to understand this impact on the 
infrastructure and plan to meet the changed demand.
In addition to understanding overall business plans, capacity management must 
understand how the use of individual live services may vary over time. Service capacity 
management is the second of the capacity management subprocesses. The service level 
requirements for each of the live services must be understood, and monitoring needs to be 
implemented to check how well the service is performing. Thresholds can be set within 
the monitoring tools to enable any possible issues to be spotted and acted upon quickly. 
See Chapter 12, “The Other Service Operation Processes,” for more information on event 
management and the use of monitoring tools and thresholds. Capacity management will 
take action to handle any issues that arise and will also consider any proactive steps that 
could be taken to improve performance. This may require working with the specialist staff 
members who carry out component capacity management.
Managing Capacity by Managing Demand
Like many countries, a certain European country requires that taxpayers complete a tax 
return online by a particular date. This is enforced by an automatic ﬁ ne for late submis-
sions. Inevitably, most taxpayers leave this until the last minute, with a huge demand for 
the system being generated in the last few days before the deadline. This demand proﬁ le 
means that the systems are overengineered to cope with a short-term spike in demand, 
and yet there is still a real risk of insufﬁ cient capacity in the last few days.
Providing even more capacity is not a good option to deal with this situation, because 
the design is overspeciﬁ ed for the level of demand across most of the year. Instead, an 
element of demand management is introduced. In addition to the 100-euro ﬁ ne for late 
submission, an incentive is introduced; for every day before the deadline that the tax 
return is submitted, there is a one-euro reduction on the tax bill. This motivates people to 
submit well before the deadline, reducing the maximum capacity required and avoiding 
any capacity-related incidents.

Capacity Management  
123
The ﬁ nal subprocess of capacity management is component capacity management. 
This is the most technical aspect of capacity management and is likely to be carried out 
by the technical management staff, with day-to-day monitoring being the responsibility of 
the technical and operations management functions. It requires a detailed understanding 
of all the components that make up the end-to-end service and their individual capabilities. 
The current utilization of each of these components must be monitored, because 
insufﬁ cient capacity in a single component could cause a bottleneck and impact the 
whole service. This subprocess will use event management to track when thresholds are 
breached so that preemptive action can be taken to overcome the issue, before service is 
affected.
Figure 6.9 shows the three capacity management subprocesses and how each is involved 
in one or more of the capacity management processes steps of reviewing and improving 
current capacity, identifying changes to capacity requirements, and providing new capacity. 
The ﬁ gure also shows the capacity plan, which we will discuss next.
Managing capacity requires the IT service provider to respond to changing 
circumstances because the expected capacity demands may prove to be an under or 
overestimation. This requires a number of key activities to be performed iteratively as 
part of the service operation stage of the lifecycle. Figure 6.10 shows this ongoing cycle. 
The ﬁ rst step involves monitoring capacity against thresholds and then analyzing the data 
this provides. Any necessary “tuning” adjustments, such as adding or removing resources 
in order to ensure that sufﬁ cient capacity is always available, are identiﬁ ed. These 
are then implemented, and the monitoring stage begins again. All of the information 
gathered from these activities is stored in the capacity management information system 
(CMIS). The CMIS forms part of the overall service knowledge management 
system (SKMS).
Overlap with Business Capacity Management
Service capacity management focuses on delivering the required and agreed capacity 
for each service. Monitoring performance will help you understand any changing use of 
the service, which overlaps with and feeds into the business capacity subprocess. Even 
if overall capacity requirements are increasing, there may be a reduction in the demand 
for a particular service. For example, a car insurance company that was launched some 
years ago to sell insurance directly to the public, through large call centers, may ﬁ nd that 
although business is increasing, the use of the call center (and the IT services used by the 
call-center agents) is decreasing, being replaced by online sales. Monitoring the increase 
or decrease in the use of a service will help business capacity management to under-
stand the likely requirements of the service in 12 to 18 months, which can be fed into the 
overall capacity plan.

Planning for the Future: The Capacity Plan and CMIS 
Capacity management works with the business to understand its current and future 
business needs and investigates future technical developments that may be able to help 
provide capacity more cheaply; this information will be used to draw up the capacity plan.
The capacity plan is an important output from the capacity management process. 
It captures the current and future requirements and proposes how these should be 
met. Drawing up the plan requires a close relationship with the strategy phase of the 
lifecycle; the strategy needs to be based on a ﬁ rm understanding of the current and future 
capabilities of the infrastructure, and the planners need input from the strategy discussions 
to understand what the future requirements will be.
The plan covers 12 to 18 months ahead so that any planned expenditure can be included 
in the negotiation of the annual IT budget. Planning this far ahead does mean assumptions 
have to be made, so the plan should be reviewed and reissued as actual requirements 
become clear. Reviews should take place at least annually and, additionally, after any major 
business change (decision to expand or divest, outsource, offshore, or otherwise change the 
IT requirements). Each review of the plan should include a reforecasting of requirements 
for the 12 to 18 months following the review.
The plan is a resource for the business and all IT departments, which will both 
contribute to it and refer to it when planning services. It should contain an introductory 
section explaining the current infrastructure and its performance and any capacity issues 
currently being experienced. It should be clear what is in scope and what is out of scope 
so that the reader understands any omissions and the reasons for them. Any assumptions 
made should also be stated.
The plan should consider a number of possible scenarios and explain why these have 
been chosen. These scenarios should be based on the information that has been gathered as 
part of the evaluation of business, service, and component capacity requirements as being 
reasonable possible outcomes. For example, the business may be planning to increase the 
workforce by at least 10 percent in six months, based on expected increased sales. The 
scenarios used might include not only one to meet the 10 percent increase but also one for 
a 5 percent increase and one for 12 percent so that if the business is less or more successful 
than it expects, there will be a plan for providing the required capacity.
The plan should examine the current capacity demands of each service, how these are 
met, and the forecast for future capacity requirements, based on the scenarios. This may 
be at a detailed level, considering storage, bandwidth, and so on. Options for meeting the 
new requirements should then be described, together with costs, risks, advantages, and 
disadvantages of each. Finally, the plan should recommend a particular approach. It is 
essential that changes are assessed for impact on the capacity plan and on the performance 
of all services and resources.
The capacity plan is stored in the capacity management information system (CMIS), 
together with reports of current performance and forecasts of future requirements.
Effective capacity management is essential if the service is going to be able to meet 
current and future demands. All three areas must be considered—business, service, and 
component capacity—to ensure that the process fulﬁ lls this requirement. Poor capacity 

126 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
management will have a serious effect on the ability of the business to achieve its 
objectives, either through a failure to deliver the service required or by making the service 
unnecessarily expensive by overproviding capacity. 
IT Service Continuity Management
As discussed when talking about availability management, a service delivers value only 
when it is available for use. In addition to the activities carried out under the availability 
management process, there is a requirement on the IT service provider to ensure that the 
service is protected from catastrophic events that could prevent it from being delivered 
at all. Where these cannot be avoided, there is a requirement to have a plan to recover 
from any such disruption in a timescale and at a cost that meets the business requirement. 
Ensuring IT service continuity is an essential element of the warranty of the service.
It is important to understand that IT service continuity management (ITSCM) is 
responsible for the continuity of the IT services required by the business. The business itself 
should have a business continuity plan to ensure that any potential situations that would 
impact the ability of the business to function are identiﬁ ed and avoided. Where it is not 
possible to avoid such an event, the business continuity management process should have a 
plan, which is appropriate and affordable, to both minimize its impact and recover from it. 
Thus, ITSCM can be seen as one of a number of elements making up a business continuity 
plan (BCM), along with a human resources continuity plan, a ﬁ nancial management 
continuity plan, a building management continuity plan, and so on.
ITSCM Without BCM
The internal IT service provider for a large insurance company in the United Kingdom 
had a well-developed IT service continuity plan. This plan was detailed and tested regu-
larly, so staff members were aware of their roles should it ever have to be used.
The business did not have a business continuity plan, however. Despite being urged by 
the IT director to consider the impact of a disaster on its ability to operate, the business 
was reluctant to spend any time or money on something that might not happen. The 
business leaders also assumed that the IT plan would be sufﬁ cient on its own.
The IT plan was based upon the need to have critical systems available to staff from a 
remote recovery site within 12 hours of a disaster that rendered the data center inoper-
able. Suggested possible events that might have this effect were ﬁ re, ﬂ oods, extreme 
weather, and so on. Any such event would have meant that the entire head ofﬁ ce (where 
the data center was based) would also be out of commission. The head ofﬁ ce employed 
600 insurance clerks selling policies and settling claims.

IT Service Continuity Management  
127
IT service continuity management process supports the organization’s business 
continuity management process. It is responsible for identifying and managing the risks to 
the IT services, agreeing with the business what the minimum requirement for the service 
would be in the event of a disaster, and ensuring that this agreed level can be provided.
A fundamental objective of the process is to reduce the chance of a disaster occurring at 
all by identifying the risks to IT services and implementing cost-effective countermeasures 
to reduce or remove the risk. Should a disaster occur despite these efforts, ITSCM ensures 
that there is a detailed, tested plan to recover the services to an agreed level within the 
agreed timescales. Dependent on the business requirement, the service restoration may need 
to take place within minutes, hours, or one or more days.
What Does ITSCM Aim to Achieve?
ITSCM should develop a number of plans to provide an acceptable level of IT services 
in the event of a major disruption. Several plans are required to ﬁ t the various scenarios 
involved. The scenarios catered for, and the decision as to what is an acceptable level of 
service, are arrived at in consultation with the overall business continuity management 
function.
The service continuity requirement may change over time as the business’s use of and 
dependence upon the various IT services changes. It is essential that ITSCM carries out 
regular business impact analysis (BIA) to ensure that the plan still ﬁ ts the requirement. 
Should the requirement have changed, the plan must also be changed.
If such an event had actually occurred, the IT plan would have meant the critical services 
would have been available within hours. However, the staff members who used these 
services would have nowhere from which to work, because there was no alternative 
ofﬁ ce accommodation planned (because there was no BCM plan). Even if some accom-
modation had been found, the staff would have been unable to work, because their work 
was based on paper ﬁ les, housed in ﬁ ling cabinets in the head ofﬁ ce. Those paper ﬁ les 
would not have been available.
Thus, the IT service continuity plan would have been useful only in the very limited 
 circumstances of a major event that affected the data center and no other parts of the 
building—an unlikely scenario!
A competitor insurance company, based a few blocks away, had a detailed business 
continuity plan in addition to an IT service continuity plan. Every document entering the 
building was scanned, and an electronic copy was stored off-site. This company could be 
secure in the knowledge that any major event affecting the data center would not prevent 
the business from being able to continue working.

128 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Risks to the IT services may also change over time, so a program of risk assessment 
exercises must be undertaken to ensure that new risks are identiﬁ ed and mitigated; the level 
of acceptable risk needs to be agreed on with the business. Risk assessment may require the 
involvement of availability and information security management, because each of these 
processes involves identifying and managing particular risks. 
The ITSCM manager will be a source of expertise on continuity issues and so may be 
consulted by the business or the rest of IT needing guidance. It is essential that all changes 
have been assessed to understand their impact on the ITSCM plans and procedures. 
An apparently straightforward change may remove a level of resilience, for example, 
or a departmental reorganization may split a single role in the plan across a number of 
individuals, meaning that this responsibility may have to be reassigned.
The major objective of ITSCM is to ensure that solutions have been developed and put 
in place to ensure that the required level of service (or better) can continue to be provided. 
Where these solutions involve the use of services supplied by external third-party suppliers, 
ITSCM will work with supplier management to ensure the necessary contracts are 
negotiated and agreed.
What Is Included in ITSCM?
Every IT service suffers from failures from time to time. ITSCM is not concerned with 
these service interruptions, which are handled through the incident management process. 
Neither does it get involved with managing risks as a result of business changes. Its focus 
is on the major events that have a catastrophic impact on the ability of the service provider 
to supply the vital services that enable the business to achieve its aims. The deﬁ nition of 
catastrophic failure will vary between organizations. For example, the trading ﬂ oor of a 
ﬁ nancial institution will feel a major impact within minutes, but other organizations may 
not be affected for hours or longer. Damage may be ﬁ nancial, but it may also be legal 
(failure to submit information in time to an ofﬁ cial regulatory or government body). There 
may be damage to the “brand.” Downtime on a global online book retailer’s website, for 
example, would cause poor publicity, as well as missed sales opportunities. Undertaking 
a business impact analysis will help the business and the service provider agree on 
what the minimum requirements are for a particular organization. They will need to 
consider the various locations, the business processes carried out there, and the services 
used at each. From this, an appropriate ITSCM response can be designed to provide the 
required technical facilities to enable the critical work to continue at the agreed level.
The scope of the ITCM process includes agreeing on the policies and the services to be 
included in the plans, carrying out business impact analysis, and assessing and managing 
likely risks. Managing the risks entails identifying any steps that could be taken to reduce 
the likelihood of an occurrence or lessen its impact if avoidance is impossible, as long as the 
cost is justiﬁ ed. 
Developing a strategy for service continuity, based on this business impact analysis and 
the risk management actions and aligned to the business continuity strategy, is a major part 
of the ITSCM process, shown in Figure 6.11. The strategy includes detailed recovery plans 

IT Service Continuity Management

and involves regular testing and adjustments as necessary should requirements change. We 
will start by looking at the business impact analysis and the risk assessment processes that 
form part of the requirements and strategy phase of the process.
Assessing Business Impact
The requirements and strategy phase of the ITSCM process—involving a detailed 
understanding of the requirement, through BIA, and an assessment of likely risks—is 
crucial. If these stages are rushed or incomplete, there is a real risk that the plans would not 
ﬁ t the business requirement, leading to severe, possibly terminal, business impact should 
the worst happen. The assessment identiﬁ es which are the key services, because it is these 
services that must continue, despite what has occurred.

BIA also considers various scenarios; the same event may not have an equivalent impact 
if it occurs at different times; the failure of ﬁ nancial reporting at year end would have a 
much greater impact than at another time, for example. The analysis should also consider 
whether the impact would escalate the longer the service was unavailable, because this 
would affect the choice of recovery option, favoring a faster recovery even at a greater cost. 
ITSCM must understand how long recovery would take and what would be required 
to enable this recovery to take place. The BIA clariﬁ es the relative business priority for 
each service. Where an impact would be severe from the start, implementing measures to 
reduce the chance of a service-affecting failure would be justiﬁ ed (failover, and so on). 
Where the impact takes some time to build up, a plan to restore the service within hours or 
days would be sufﬁ cient (see Figure 6.12). Each organization is likely to include a variety 
of recovery requirements. 
Business impact analysis provides a mapping of the critical business processes against 
the IT components that provide the IT service that supports it. Only with this information 
can a decision be made as to what needs to be recovered and the necessary timescales. 
It is essential that senior business staff and those who actually carry out the activity are 
involved in the BIA; IT would otherwise decide this from an entirely technical viewpoint, 
being unaware that some apparently minor system may actually be required to deliver 
critical business processes. The business may also decide that the fast recovery options are 
too expensive and readjust their requirements.

Assessing Risk
Although the ITSCM plan provides a level of assurance that critical business processes 
could be recovered in a suitable timescale should a catastrophic event occur, it is preferable 
that the event does not occur at all. Many such events cannot be foreseen, or prevented, 
but a thorough risk assessment and management of the identiﬁ ed risks greatly reduces 
the likelihood. Risk assessment requires an understanding of likely threats and how 
vulnerable the organization is to those threats. Risk management then considers suitable 
cost-justiﬁ able responses to these threats. The aim is to reduce the vulnerability to the risk, 
making it less likely to occur, or to minimize its impact, should it be unpreventable. As 
you learned earlier, risk management also takes place in the availability and information 
security management processes.
Risk assessment will compile a list of evaluated risks—some within an acceptable level 
of risk, some beyond it. The countermeasures should reduce the likelihood or the impact of 
a threat, reducing its score to within acceptable levels. Table 6.1 shows an example of the 
output from an assessment.

Design Coordination  
133
Business impact analysis and risk management enable the IT service provider and the 
business to devise an appropriate ITSCM plan combining risk reduction measures with 
recovery in the event of an unavoidable event. The plan will be cost-effective, because only 
the critical services will have a full, speedy recovery; other services will have a lower level 
of protection that ﬁ ts their lower level of criticality.
Not all risks can be avoided. A disaster affecting a nearby location, such as a gas 
explosion, would inevitably impact the service being provided; if the interruption to 
the service is short-lived, it may be decided that invoking the ITSCM plan is not 
warranted.
Design Coordination
Service design involves many different aspects beyond designing a new application to 
provide new functionality (utility). Consideration must be given to how the service will 
operate, both now and in the future; what level of availability, security, continuity, 
and capacity will need to be provided; and the best approach to this (warranty). Other 
processes will interface with the service design processes. To ensure a successful outcome, 
the design activities must be coordinated.
The purpose of the design coordination process is to carry out the coordination of the 
many different activities of service design. The many processes and numerous interfaces 
involved are all potential sources of conﬂ ict. By providing a single point, complications and 
misunderstandings are avoided.
The objectives of this process include ensuring that all aspects of the design, including 
the architecture, processes, and metrics, are designed to provide the utility and warranty 
of the service to a level that meets the business requirement now and in the future. 
Where there are several competing projects, design coordination ensures the resolution 
of conﬂ icting demands. It also ensures that the resources and capabilities needed for 
a successful implementation are in place and ensures that service design packages are 
compiled and transmitted to the appropriate transition staff when required. It ensures 
that everyone is clear about what needs to be handed over between the different lifecycle 
changes and the quality criteria they must meet. 
Design coordination will check that the proposed design conforms to the agreed 
standards and that repeatable design practices are used so that there is a consistency of 
approach across services. It will try to identify any improvements to the design stage that 
could be used in future projects.
Design coordination covers all the various activities in design and ensures consistency 
across them. All activities regarding the design of any new services, changes to existing 
services, or the retirement of services will beneﬁ t from this process. It covers large projects, 
as well as those designs that are too small to merit a project being set up but whose 
activities would beneﬁ t from being coordinated. Some activities are too small to require 
coordination. The majority of design coordination will focus on major changes and larger 

134 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
projects, where the complexity of the tasks and the number of people involved present a 
risk that these tasks could become out of step with each other. Design coordination reduces 
that risk signiﬁ cantly. 
Deciding which activities require design coordination and which do not is a matter for 
individual organizations to decide. Each organization must also consider how it wants to 
decide upon the level of coordination required. 
Fitting the Process to the Business Requirement
The internal service provider for a large retail organization was concerned about the qual-
ity of changes that had been implemented in the past, many of which required rework 
later because not all implications had been considered. It was agreed that all changes 
would be considered to have a design phase. Even smaller changes now had deﬁ ned 
design activities, including implementation plans. The coordination process in this situ-
ation was usually straightforward, acting as a check to ensure that all the activities had 
been carried out. Where necessary, when changes were more complex, there would be 
a greater level of detailed coordination. The organization was happy that this level of 
involvement in all changes addressed the concerns.
Another organization took an opposite view, regarding such involvement in all changes 
as unnecessarily bureaucratic. It laid down criteria restricting the involvement of the 
service coordination process to major changes or projects. It was happy with the level of 
assurance this approach provided.
Both of these organizations were right; the level of coordination in each case ﬁ tted the 
business requirement and each organization’s attitude toward risk. The ﬁ rst organization 
had poor experiences in the past, and implementing design coordination for all changes 
gave it the reassurance it required. Organizations such as government departments, 
global enterprises, and those with safety-critical systems are likely to want this level of 
assurance. The second organization was happy with a “lighter touch.” Organizations that 
need to be dynamic and responsive to fast-changing requirements, such as those provid-
ing web services, are more likely to adopt this approach.
The design coordination process includes providing the required level of assistance to 
projects or changes that the organization has decided is appropriate. It ensures that 
all resources are managed effectively, avoiding scheduling issues and overcommitment 
of resources, by ensuring that resource planning is carried out in advance.
The process ensures that a standard approach is used wherever possible and that policies 
and guidelines are followed. It conﬁ rms that the service designs are documented and handed 
over with the service design package to transition. It carries out checks to evaluate whether 

Exam Essentials  
135
the design is both ﬁ t for use and ﬁ t for purpose. It also ensures that the guidelines are 
updated when required. By monitoring the success of the service design activities, it identiﬁ es 
opportunities for continual service improvement and ensures they are implemented. 
The process is concerned solely with the design phase. The role is one of coordination; 
the actual contents of the solution are the responsibility of the individual projects.
Summary
The processes discussed in this chapter are essential to an effective design; by effective, we 
mean not only a design that provides the required functionality but also one in which the 
requirements of the service in operation are fully considered. The design takes into account 
the immediate needs but also ensures the future requirements for changes, increased 
capacity, and so on, are fully considered. Through availability and IT service continuity 
management, the design ensures that the service will be available to an agreed level when 
required and will be protected from unnecessary risks. The business can be assured that 
the required level of information security has been built in and that IT management will 
be able to monitor and manage performance, because the metrics needed will have been 
included. The service coordination process ensures that all these processes work smoothly 
together to ensure an efﬁ cient handoff to the transition phase.
Exam Essentials
Understand the format of the service catalog as a database or structured document, form-
ing one of the three service portfolio elements. Be able to describe its contents and infor-
mation about all live IT services, including those available for deployment. Understand the 
purpose of the service catalog as a single source of consistent information to authorized 
individuals on all current and forthcoming operational services and the importance of this 
information being kept accurate and current. There are two types of services included in 
the catalog: customer-facing services that are visible to the business and supporting ser-
vices required by the service provider to deliver customer-facing services. Understand that 
the customer and the service provider will therefore have different views of each service. 
Understand also that different customer types such as wholesale or retail customers may 
have different views.
Understand the type of information held in the service catalog for individual services such 
as service details, status, interfaces, and dependencies and the way in which this infor-
mation is used by other processes, such as service level management. The scope of the 
service catalog includes only those services that have been or will be transitioned to the 
operational environment. Remember that these may be listed individually or in the form of 
service packages.

136 
Chapter 6 ■ The Other Service Design Processes
Understand what is meant by availability and how it is calculated. Remember that the 
user is concerned with end-to-end availability, and the failure of one component can make 
the whole service unavailable to that user. Measurement of availability takes into account 
only agreed service time so that agreed downtime and out-of-hours availability are not 
included in the calculation. Identifying vital business functions helps availability manage-
ment target its activities to the best effect. 
Be able to describe the availability concepts of reliability, resilience, maintainability, and 
serviceability. Reliability concerns how long a service, component, or CI can function 
without an interruption and the impact of this on overall availability. Understand what is 
meant by mean time between failure and how it is calculated. A resilient service design may 
suffer component failures without the service being affected. Understand the role of redun-
dant equipment in providing resilience. Maintainability concerns how quickly a service, 
component, or CI can be restored to normal working status following a failure, as well as 
the impact of this on overall availability. Understand what is meant by mean time to restore 
service and how it is calculated. Serviceability is how well a third party is able to provide 
the response and ﬁ x times required in its contract following a failure, as well as the impact 
of this on overall availability.
Understand the purpose and importance of the information security policy. The level 
of security required is a business decision, and it is the responsibility of the information 
security manager to then ensure the required level of protection is provided. Understand 
the purpose of related policies such as password and Internet use policies and how they 
contribute to the overall protection of the organization’s data. Understand the concepts of 
conﬁ dentiality (restricting access to data to authorized users), integrity (maintaining data 
free of any corruption or unauthorized change), and availability (able to be accessed when 
required) of data. Security rules must be clearly communicated so that all staff members 
are aware of them and senior management is enforcing them. SLAs, OLAs, and underpin-
ning contracts play a central role in documenting and agreeing on responsibilities in this 
area. All security breaches must be documented and responded to appropriately and should 
be considered opportunities to improve security.
Understand the importance of suppliers to ensuring the quality of the overall service and 
the need to ensure that suppliers deliver value for money. Understand the link between 
underpinning contracts as part of service level management and the management of sup-
pliers. Understand the lifecycle of supplier management, from the signing of the contract 
through the management of the delivery by the supplier against that contract to its renewal 
or termination. Be able to explain the importance of the supplier management policy and 
the role of the supplier and contract management information system. Understand the dif-
ferent categories of suppliers (strategic, tactical, operational, and commodity) and how 
suppliers are assessed in terms of value, importance, risk, and impact to determine which 
category is appropriate.
Understand the role of capacity management in providing the current and future capac-
ity and performance that the business requires, when it requires it, and at a cost it can 
afford. Understand the use of demand management to affect this requirement. Be able to 

Exam Essentials  
137
explain the subprocesses of business, service, and component capacity management and the 
role each plays in delivering what is required. Understand the involvement of the different 
functions in assessing and providing sufﬁ cient capacity. Understand the purpose and con-
tents of the capacity plan and the requirement for it to be revised as requirements change. 
Understand the purpose and contents of the capacity management information system.
Understand how IT service continuity management (ITSCM) is responsible for pro-
viding an agreed level of service in the event of a major disruption to normal working 
conditions. Be able to differentiate between the responsibilities of business continuity 
management and ITSCM. Be able to explain the concept of business impact analysis and 
the requirement for the participation of the business in this exercise. The two stages of risk 
management are identiﬁ cation of risks and cost-justiﬁ able risk mitigation. ITSCM is not 
entirely about recovering from a catastrophic event; it also addresses the need to prevent 
or reduce the impact of such an event. Understand the importance of keeping the plan up-
to-date and the need to assess changes for possible impact on it. Remember that the plan 
needs to be rehearsed to ensure that it works as designed.
Understand the role of design coordination in providing a single point of coordination 
and control for all service design activities and processes. Understand the role of design 
coordination in managing resources and capabilities and its responsibility for compiling the 
service design package. It has a key role in ensuring quality and consistency across designs 
and ensuring the conformance of designs to governance requirements. Design coordination 
ensures the successful handoff of a service ﬁ rst from strategy to design and then to transi-
tion. The coordination process helps control cost, ensure adherence to warranty and utility 
requirements, and ensure activities are appropriately scheduled. A central coordinating 
role is able to learn from each design stage and implement improvements to all the service 
design activities.

This chapter covers the people aspect of service design; speciﬁ -
cally, we will be examining the various roles that are required 
to be carried out if this lifecycle stage is to deliver effectively. 
We will look at a method of showing these roles and the various levels of involvement in a 
process activity. Finally, we will look at how organizations can ensure that their staff can 
obtain the required skills to enable them to be effective.
Roles and Responsibilities 
in Service Management
There are many different ways to organize an IT department, and no two service providers 
are identical, so the exact conﬁ guration of roles within each organization will differ. Often 
two or more roles may be combined; in other organizations, a single role may be split. 
ITIL provides guidelines, not prescriptive rules, so each organization should consider what 
would best ﬁ t their own requirements.
We will ﬁ rst clarify what is meant by the term role. The ofﬁ cial glossary deﬁ nes it as 
follows:
A set of responsibilities, activities and authorities assigned to a person or 
team. A role is defined in a process or function.
Within each of the processes we have covered, we have described a number of roles. The 
role may be carried out by an individual or a team, and one person may have multiple roles. 
The person responsible for the availability management of the infrastructure may often also 
be fulﬁ lling the capacity management role. It may be that capacity management is divided 
between a number of people, with one considering network capacity, another responsible 
for storage, and so on. 
It is important to remember that although roles may be shared, or combined, there can 
be only one process owner for each process and one service owner for each service.
Often a job title may be the same as a role description; service level manager is one such 
example. Job titles are for each organization to decide, and it may be the case that the job 
of service level manager includes the role of service level manager, along with one or more 
other roles, such as supplier manager, within that particular organization.
It is also often true that one task carried out by an individual may touch several pro-
cesses. A technician may submit a request for change to overcome a capacity issue that has 
been identiﬁ ed by problem management. The action may have been identiﬁ ed as desirable 

Roles and Responsibilities in Service Management  
145
as part of a service improvement plan (SIP), which has been logged on the CSI register. The 
technician’s action therefore involves several processes: problem, change, capacity, service 
level management, and continual service improvement.
Every process has its own speciﬁ c roles. Here we will be looking at the generic roles that 
appear in all lifecycle stages. 
Service Owner 
With every service interacting with so many processes, there is a danger that the service 
itself may no longer receive the required attention. To avoid this, ITIL recommends that 
each service should have a single service owner. This clariﬁ es who is accountable for the 
service and ensures that there is a focus on the business processes that the service 
supports.
Whatever technology is used to deliver the service and regardless of whether aspects 
of the technology are provided in-house or are outsourced, the service owner remains 
accountable for delivering the service. This role is responsible to the customer for the 
service being developed, implemented, and maintained, but it is also accountable to the 
IT director or service management director for its delivery.
As we will examine, ITIL recommends that each process should have an identiﬁ able 
owner. Each process may affect many services, and it is the service owner of each who will 
ensure the service is delivered effectively and efﬁ ciently, whatever process is being carried 
out. Service owners will often own more than one service. For each service, they will 
carry out the following responsibilities:
■ 
Ensuring that the service is delivered and supported to the required standards, by 
working with all IT groups and process owners
■ 
Ensuring that the customer’s requirements are understood and that the tasks required 
to deliver them are implemented by working with the business relationship manager
■ 
Communicating with the customer as required on all issues regarding the delivery of 
the service
■ 
Using the service portfolio management process to deﬁ ne new service models and to 
evaluate the impact of any changes to existing services
■ 
Ensuring that the service undergoes continual service improvement by identifying 
possible improvements and, with the customer’s agreement, putting these forward as 
requests for change
■ 
Ensuring that appropriate monitoring and reporting is taking place to enable an accu-
rate view of the level of service being delivered
■ 
Ensuring that the required levels of performance and availability are delivered
■ 
Developing a thorough understanding of the components that make up the service and 
ensuring that the potential impact of their failure is realized
■ 
Representing the service across the organization and attending service review meetings 
with the business

146 
Chapter 7 ■ Service Design Roles
■ 
Representing the service within IT and at change advisory board meetings and internal 
service reviews
■ 
Being the escalation (notiﬁ cation) point for major incidents affecting the service
■ 
Working with service level to negotiate service level agreements that meet the customer 
requirements and operational-level agreements that support the service provision at the 
agreed level
■ 
Maintaining the service catalog entry
■ Working with the CSI manager to identify improvements to be added to the CSI 
 register and participating in the review and prioritization of these and their eventual 
implementation
As the owner of the service, this role is concerned with the impact of any process affect-
ing the service. This means service owners should be considered stakeholders in these 
 processes, with whatever level of involvement is appropriate.
For example, the service owner plays a major part in the major incident process and will 
attend or possibly run any crisis meetings. They will also be involved in investigating the 
root cause of problems affecting their service. The service owner will represent the service 
at CAB meetings and will be involved in discussions regarding if and when a release should 
go ahead. They will want to ensure that the service portfolio and catalog entries and con-
ﬁ guration data held on their service is accurate.
As explained earlier, there will be a close relationship between the service level 
management process and the service owner who acts as the contact point for the service. 
The service owner will also liaise with the owners of the more technical processes, 
such as availability and capacity, to ensure that the data collected by these processes 
indicates that the performance and reliability of these services meets the agreed standard.
The service owner is responsible for ensuring that the IT service continuity manage-
ment plan for their service is practical and that every element of the plan is in place. They 
will work with the ITSCM manager to make sure that all aspects are considered. They will 
often attend rehearsals of the plan to observe it in action to conﬁ rm that nothing has been 
forgotten.
The service owner understands the costs involved in delivering the service and will work 
with the supplier manager and other managers to ensure that costs are controlled and value 
for money is achieved. In organizations where the business is charged for IT services, they 
will ensure that the recovery of costs takes place as agreed. 
Finally, the service owner ensures that the service follows the information security 
management policies.
Process Owner 
As we have seen, the service owner is the focus for one particular service, across all process 
areas. The process owner, in contrast, is accountable for a single process, whatever the service 
it affects.

Roles and Responsibilities in Service Management  
147
The process owner must ensure that the process works efﬁ ciently and effectively. 
Although the role may often be carried out by the same person who fulﬁ lls the process 
manager role, in larger organizations this is less likely. A global company may have a 
change management process owner and a number of process managers carrying out the 
process in different countries, for example. The process owner is accountable for ensuring 
the process is ﬁ t for its purpose and is being carried out correctly by the process managers 
and practitioners. The role therefore has both a design and an enforcement aspect.
The process owner is accountable for the following:
■ 
Developing the process strategy, policies, and standards
■ Designing the process and amending it as required to implement improvements that 
make it more effective or efﬁ cient
■ Designing the metrics for the process and ensuring that these provide the necessary 
information to judge the effectiveness and efﬁ ciency of the process
■ Ensuring that the process is documented, that this documentation is available to those 
that require it, and that it is updated as needed
■ Where the process has changed, ensuring that the process documentation is updated 
and the changes communicated to the process practitioners (those who actually carry 
out the process steps)
■ Auditing the process activities to ensure adherence to the correct process
■ Ensuring that the required resources are available to carry out the process and that the 
staff members involved have been trained to carry it out
■ Communicating to the process technicians the importance of adhering to the 
 documented process and explaining the implications for IT and the business of 
 nonadherence
■ As part of continual service improvement, reviewing the process strategy and the effec-
tiveness of the process itself to identify possible improvements
■ 
Where improvements to effectiveness or efﬁ ciency are identiﬁ ed, having these included 
in the CSI register and working with the CSI manager to review, prioritize, and imple-
ment them as appropriate
The process owner role is critical to the success of the process. In organizations where 
no such single point of ownership exists, those carrying out the process may decide to drop 
or amend steps in the process, and there is no one with the overall authority to prevent 
this. In global organizations, this can mean the process may develop regional variations. In 
 addition to the danger of losing focus on the purpose of the process, this may invalidate the 
reporting from the process, because each area may be inputting data differently.
In Chapter 1, we discussed a generic process model. Without a process owner, there is 
no one with the responsibility of ensuring consistency in applying the process, and there 
is no one to ensure that the process output still matches the process objectives. Process 
 documentation may not be updated, because the responsibility for its upkeep would be 
unclear. Finally, there would be no one to assess the process and identify improvements.

148 
Chapter 7 ■ Service Design Roles
Process Manager 
The process owner is accountable for the success of the process but may often not be 
 responsible for actually carrying it out. The responsibility for managing the day-to-day 
implementation of a process belongs to the process manager. In large or geographically 
spread-out organizations, there may be several process managers responsible for managing 
the implementation of the same process, each with a regional or infrastructure responsibility. 
The process manager is accountable for the following:
■ 
Liaising with the process owner to ensure that the process is implemented across all 
lifecycle stages as the process owner intended
■ 
Ensuring the right numbers of staff are assigned to the various roles within the process 
and that they understand what is required of them
■ 
Working with other process managers and service owners to ensure the services are 
delivered as required
■ 
Monitoring the process metrics to conﬁ rm the process is working as designed
■ 
As part of continual service improvement, reviewing the process performance to 
 identify possible improvements
■ 
Where improvements are identiﬁ ed, having them included in the CSI register and work-
ing with the CSI manager and process owner to review, prioritize, and implement them 
as appropriate
The role of process manager is important, because it is the process manager who ensures 
that the process is carried out correctly day-to-day. The process manager may be distant 
from where the process actually occurs (working in the head ofﬁ ce, while the process takes 
place in branch ofﬁ ces, for example). The process manager, or managers, will ensure that 
the staff members understand what is required of them and have been provided with the 
right resources and training to carry out the tasks. As process managers are close to the pro-
cess execution, they are in an ideal position to identify issues and possible improvements. 
The success of any improvement initiatives will depend heavily on the enthusiastic involve-
ment of the process manager in ensuring that staff members adopt the improved process.
Process Practitioner 
Dependent on the process, there may be one or more people carrying out the process activi-
ties. In a small organization or for a simple process, this may be a single person, who is 
also likely to be the process manager. For a large organization or for a complex process, 
there may be many people, each carrying out parts of the process. The people involved in 
carrying out the process activities are the process practitioners. 
The process practitioner is usually responsible for the following:
■ 
Completing process activities to the required standard
■ Understanding the importance of the process, and their role within it, in delivering 
the service

Designing Roles Using the RACI Model  
149
■ Working with all the process stakeholders to ensure the process inputs, outputs, and 
interfaces are working properly so that the process delivers the desired result
■ Producing evidence that the process activities have been carried out correctly, in the 
form of records
■ Identifying necessary improvements to the process or supporting tool
The process practitioner role is responsible for actually delivering the process activities. 
Under the guidance of the process manager (unless these roles are combined), the practi-
tioner is responsible for carrying out the process as designed, consistently and efﬁ ciently. 
It may be tempting to believe that the practitioner has nothing to contribute other than 
 carrying out the activities; this is far from the truth. As a practitioner, the staff member 
will experience ﬁ rst-hand any issues with the process, such as tools that do not support the 
process effectively, bottlenecks in the process ﬂ ow, or ambiguities in the documentation. 
The process manager and process owner should therefore seek out the views of practitio-
ners when attempting to identify possible improvements.
Each role has its own purpose. Even where the roles are carried out by the same 
 person, that person should attempt to consider each aspect of the roles. The practitioner 
has the advantage of daily interaction with the process but may be too close to it to see it 
objectively; the process manager is judged on the outcome of the process so has a particu-
lar focus on the resources required to deliver these effectively and efﬁ ciently. They will 
monitor the process metrics closely to ensure that the outputs are being delivered on time 
and within budget. The manager will see only their own part of the process delivery, 
however. The process owner has the advantage of seeing the overall picture, comparing 
the delivery of the process in different locations and under different process managers. 
By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective, a complete picture of 
the process delivery can be achieved, and improvement initiatives can be gathered from 
each level.
Designing Roles Using the RACI Model
In the ﬁ rst part of this chapter, we looked at the roles ITIL describes in relation to pro-
cesses. With many service management processes and multiple roles within each, it is 
important that these roles are clearly deﬁ ned for each individual process. Where it is not 
clear who has the authority to make a decision, organizations can ﬁ nd that processes fail 
to deliver, because of contradictory decisions being made by different people or perhaps no 
decisions being made at all. Where processes are failing to deliver, this can often be traced 
to such confusion; everybody agrees something should be done but not who should do it. 
Delay or dissent can result, which affects the effectiveness of the process and ultimately the 
level of service delivered.
It is essential, therefore, that there should be an agreement as to the responsibilities 
and accountabilities for each process task. This is especially true where activities within a 
process are carried out by staff across business units. A process such as service asset and 

150 
Chapter 7 ■ Service Design Roles
conﬁ guration management may involve staff from the technical teams within IT, who may 
deﬁ ne conﬁ guration item relationships and install or change those items; it may also involve 
non-IT teams such as ﬁ nance or procurement.
It is a critical success factor for effective processes that responsibility and accountability 
are clearly deﬁ ned. Best practice in this area involves mapping the tasks to roles and deﬁ n-
ing the level of involvement in the task for each role. The RACI model or matrix is com-
monly used across many industries to show the roles and responsibilities for activities and 
processes. It is a simple-to-understand, visual summary, and it clariﬁ es the responsibilities 
and accountabilities to all stakeholders, removing confusion and allowing decisions to be 
made without delay. 
The acronym RACI stands for the four levels of involvement in a process activity: 
Responsible Those who are deﬁ ned as responsible are the people who “get the job done” 
by actually carrying out the task. There must always be at least one person responsible for 
each task.
Accountable This single individual owns the task and ensures that the quality of the work 
carried out meets the required standard. The buck stops with them. To avoid any confu-
sion, there can be only one person accountable for each task, and each task must have an 
accountable person. 
Consulted Where appropriate for the process, there may be people who are consulted for 
their opinion regarding a process activity. They provide information. This is not a manda-
tory role like Accountable and Responsible; there may or may not be a Consulted person 
for an activity.
Informed These people are updated as to the progress of the activity. As with Consulted, 
this is not a mandatory role; it depends on the particular activity.
Where the RACI model is applied to the process as a whole, as opposed to its individual 
activities, the process owner would normally be deﬁ ned as accountable for the end-to-end 
process.
Table 7.1 shows an example of a change management RACI matrix. Each row represents 
a speciﬁ c activity, and each column shows the people involved and their level of involve ment. 
To build a RACI matrix for an activity, you must ﬁ rst identify the processes or activities 
and the roles. Through discussion with the people involved, agree on who is responsible for 
each activity or process and their level of involvement. There may be some activities where 
this is not clear, for example, when many roles have responsibility or where no one appears 
to be responsible. This situation can often be resolved by breaking the activity down into 
smaller activities. For example, a “new joiner” process may have the step “Grant access 
to the system” as an activity. Breaking this activity down into “Deﬁ ne access required,” 
“Authorize access Request,” and “Set up required access” should make it easier to deﬁ ne 
clear roles and responsibilities. When complete, the matrix should be discussed and 
agreed on.
The RACI matrix is useful when designing a new process to ensure that all aspects have 
been considered; it is also useful as a diagnostic tool when seeking to improve a failing 
process. Consideration should be given in this case to whether the accountability lies with 

Designing Roles Using the RACI Model  
151
As discussed previously, individuals may carry out numerous activities across several 
processes. Someone working in the technical management function may have a role in 
availability, capacity, incident, problem, and change management. They will have a line 
manager within the technical management function but are also answerable to the various 
process owners for carrying out the process activities correctly. 
There are two other advantages to using a RACI matrix other than the primary purpose 
of clarifying roles and levels of involvement within the process. First, the responsibili-
ties deﬁ ned for an individual or team can be helpful when thinking about what should 
be included in an operational-level agreement. Second, the workﬂ ow and handoff points 
between activities and individuals is clariﬁ ed and shows where communication should ﬂ ow. 
Continual service improvement will use this latter information to deﬁ ne what communica-
tion is required during CSI. 
There may be difﬁ culties encountered when using the RACI model. These could include 
the splitting of authority between process activities, which could make it difﬁ cult to under-
stand who is accountable for the end-to-end process; remember that this overall account-
ability lies with the process owner. Using the RACI model will also show where delegation 
of responsibility or accountability has taken place without necessary authority also being 
delegated. Comparing the RACI matrixes across a number of processes may highlight that 
one person has responsibility for a number of closely related processes, such as incident and 
problem management or change and release and deployment management. These processes 
are meant to be separate, and combining the responsibility for them in this way may reduce 
checks and balances that support good governance. 
RACI is a simple-to-use method to clarify roles and identify potential conﬂ icts or issues; 
as such, it is invaluable when designing service management processes.

the correct person or whether one person is responsible for too many activities, leading to 
confusion as to their priorities and possible delays. Once the roles have been documented,

Chapter 7 ■ Service Design Roles
Competence and Training 
Effective service management requires staff members who understand their job role, not 
only the tasks they need to perform but the importance of these tasks and their relation-
ship to other processes. Developing staff competencies and skills is an important element in 
managing services successfully. 
The best known and most popular service management training scheme is the ITIL 
Qualiﬁ cations scheme. This scheme provides a modular approach to the ITIL framework. 
It comprises a series of qualiﬁ cations focused on different aspects of ITIL best practices 
to various degrees of depth and detail. Each ITIL qualiﬁ cation has a speciﬁ c credit value; 
these credits can be used by candidates who are interested in achieving the ITIL expert 
level. The expert level requires candidates to meet a speciﬁ c set of key requirements, cover-
ing the full spectrum of ITIL best practices. 
This section, covering the topics of competence and training, is not 
included in the foundation examination but is included in the syllabus, 
because an understanding of competence and skills is essential for 
service management.
Competence and Skills for Service Management
As discussed previously, the “people” aspect within the four p’s of effective service manage-
ment is crucial; good processes depend upon them. Service management products deliver 
little value if not operated by skilled staff. Third-party suppliers require competent staff 
within the service provider organization if they are to be effective.
Having the right number of people is not enough; they need to have undergone the train-
ing to enable them to be good at their jobs. (Remember that people are both a resource 
and a capability; education and training develops their capability.) Good staff training will 
ensure that individuals understand their roles. Training is not a one-off activity; as changes 
to processes, technology, and services occur, further training will be required. As we have 
discussed, staff will be involved across different lifecycle stages; someone based in an oper-
ational role may have involvement in design, transition, and CSI. Each role they carry out 
will require speciﬁ c skills, attributes, and competences. All roles require the following:
■ Everyone needs a reasonable awareness of the business in order to understand how IT 
in general, and the process in particular, helps the business achieve its objectives
■ 
They need customer service skills. These are often thought to be necessary only for 
service desk staff; although they are essential for that role, they are also required by 
any role where the IT staff member may come into contact with the business. Desktop 
engineers, for example, interact with customers on a daily basis, and those involved in 
coordinating user acceptance testing or service reviews also have regular user contact, 
so customer service skills are a requirement for all. 

Competence and Training   
153
■ All staff members require the knowledge to carry out their roles; they also need to 
understand the policies and procedures involved.
Additional attributes may also be required, dependent on the role. These include 
 management skills and the ability to run meetings, such as chairing, taking minutes, and 
so on. Being able to communicate effectively, in speech and in writing, is essential, and the 
ability to negotiate and persuade will help ensure others conform to what is required of 
them. Finally, all roles involve some interpretation of metrics, so analytical skills are also 
necessary.
Staff may also participate in CSI initiatives. The CSI core guidance describes the speciﬁ c 
skills required for them.
Competence and Skills Framework
It can be helpful for service providers to adopt a standard framework for describing job titles, 
roles and responsibilities, and so on. The Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) 
is an example of such a reference model. It deﬁ nes the necessary skills for effective IT ser-
vices, information systems, and technology. SFIA deﬁ nes seven generic levels for tasks, with 
the associated professional skills required. It also deﬁ nes core competencies. SFIA is used by 
many IT service providers. You can ﬁ nd more information on SFIA at www.sfia.org.uk.
Specific Training in the ITIL Framework
In addition to the core guidance provided in the ITIL volumes covering service strategy, 
service design, service transition, service operation and continual service improvement, and 
the complementary guidance, training is available to enable staff to understand this best 
practice service management framework and to develop the necessary skills and competen-
cies to carry out its guidance.
The scheme, shown in Figure 7.1, is managed and controlled through the ofﬁ cial 
accreditor, accredited examination institutes, and accredited training organizations to 
ensure that organizations can be conﬁ dent in its quality. All training material used and 
individual trainers also have to meet quality standards. Students take examinations at the 
end of each course to achieve the relevant certiﬁ cate, and the qualiﬁ cations gained are evi-
dence that the student has acquired the associated knowledge of ITIL best practices. The 
qualiﬁ cations are recognized worldwide.
The scheme has four levels:
Foundation Level This acts as an entry point to, and a prerequisite for, the rest of the 
scheme. This book is intended to prepare you to take the foundation exam.
Intermediate Level Following the foundation level, organizations can develop particular 
knowledge and skills in their staff. Courses at this level are in two groups:
Lifecycle Courses Five courses, each providing management level with knowledge par-
ticular to each lifecycle stage — service strategy, service design, service transition, service 
operation, and continual service improvement (three points per successful qualiﬁ cation)

154 
Chapter 7 ■ Service Design Roles
Capability Courses Four courses, each covering particular areas within service man-
agement at a practitioner (hands-on, how-to do; four points per successful qualiﬁ cation)
The four courses are:
1. 
Operational Support and Analysis: This course covers request fulﬁ llment and the event, 
incident, problem, and access management processes. It also considers the four func-
tions of the service desk and technical, IT operations, and application management.
2. 
Planning, Protection, and Optimization: This course covers capacity, availability, IT 
service continuity, information security and demand management.
3. 
Release, Control and Validation: This course covers change and service asset and 
 conﬁ guration management, service validation and testing, release and deployment, 
request fulﬁ llment, change evaluation, and knowledge management.
4. 
Service Offerings and Agreements: This course covers service portfolio and  service 
 catalog management, service level, demand, supplier, ﬁ nancial, and business 
 relationship management.
Individuals may choose to do one or more of these courses to enhance their professional 
development. Each course is worth a number of credits, so students may collect these 
credits toward achieving ITIL Expert status, should they want.

Summary
In this chapter we discussed the key roles involved in successful service management. 
We considered the importance of the process owner is ensuring that the process is (and 
remains) ﬁ t for purpose. The importance of the process manager and process practitioner 
in actually carrying out the process as deﬁ ned by the process owner were also examined. 
Finally we looked at the role of the service owner in providing a single point of focus and 
accountability for a service. Deﬁ ning these roles and allocating them to individuals is an 
important element of service management. Using the RACI matrix explained in this chap-
ter enables an unambiguous deﬁ nition of roles and responsibilities in each process, and 
ensures that accountability is clearly deﬁ ned.
In this chapter we also considered the skills and competencies that are required and the 
ITIL qualiﬁ cation structure.
Exam Essentials
Understand the roles and responsibilities of the service owner. The service owner is 
accountable for ensuring the delivery of the service. The service owner will liaise with 
 process owners to ensure that the service is delivered to the highest standard possible.
Understand the roles and responsibilities of the process owner, the process manager, and the 
process practitioner. The process owner is accountable for ensuring the successful delivery 
of a process across all services and takes a lead role in ensuring that the process outcomes 
match the objectives. There may be several process managers for each process, each responsi-
ble for managing the day-to-day implementation of the process by the process practitioners in 
their own geographical or infrastructure area. The process practitioner is responsible for car-
rying out the process tasks under the direction of the process manager. One person may carry 
out more than one of these roles, although there is a danger that process control may not be as 
strong when this is the case, because of individuals being too close to the process to be objec-
tive. All roles have a responsibility to identify possible improvements in the process, but it is 
the process owner’s responsibility to evaluate them and implement the ones that have value.
Understand the purpose of the RACI model in defining roles and responsibilities within 
processes. Be able to explain the difference between Responsible, Accountable,  Consulted, 
and Informed. Understand that only one person can be accountable for each activity and 
that every activity must have, as a minimum, a responsible and an accountable person.

In the next chapter, we will consider the other service transi-
tion processes. The service transition lifecycle stage is concerned with the delivery of a new 
or changed service into the live operational environment. 
The service transition processes are used throughout the life cycle to provide control over 
the live operational environment. Change management is used both to deliver new services 
and to modify them later and so provides control over the infrastructure. The service tran-
sition process of  service asset and conﬁ guration management provides a source of informa-
tion which is used in transition, and the rest of the life cycle. Knowledge management is 
particularly important during transition, but also takes place throughout the life cycle.
Understanding Service Transition
During this lifecycle stage, you will explore the management and control of the infrastruc-
ture and service management processes.
The Purpose of Service Transition
Each stage of the lifecycle has a distinct purpose, and the purpose of service transition is to 
ensure that the services that have been agreed on and designed through the stages of strat-
egy and design are now delivered effectively into operation. 
Any new, modiﬁ ed, or retired service should be transitioned in accordance with the 
plans and documents that have been prepared to meet the expectations of the business. 
This is true if the service has been designed by the internal service provider or sourced from 
outside the organization. The efforts that have been made during the previous lifecycle 
stages—negotiating with customers to understand their needs and requirements and the 
agreements that have been put in place—all need to be considered when introducing a new 
service or a change to an existing service. It is in this stage that we are setting the expecta-
tion of the business, because this is the stage where we will test the new service for its abil-
ity to perform as required.
Think about this in terms of a project or implementation in which you have had some 
involvement. What were the things that went well during the handover to operational staff? 
What went badly and caused issues in support or customer experience? It is during transi-
tion that we address these issues and put in place measureable, repeatable activities that 
will enable a smooth handover into operations.

Understanding Service Transition 
161
Transition is an important lifecycle stage, because it ensures that the business receives 
the services as agreed and that they can be used as intended. Ensuring the proper use of 
services is critical in achieving customer satisfaction; if your customer does not understand 
how the service is intended to work, they may ﬁ nd fault with something that it was never 
intended to perform.
This lifecycle stage is concerned with the experience for the customer and user and also 
for the support staff. All the stakeholders who will be receiving the new service or change 
to the existing services need to be considered as part of the transition planning. If a service 
is to be retired, the same careful and considered approach should be adopted so that the 
retirement of the service is seamless, particularly if there is a replacement service being 
implemented at the same time.
The Objectives of Service Transition 
The objectives of this stage are to do the following:
■ 
Plan and manage changes to services, the introduction of new services, or the retire-
ment of services efﬁ ciently and effectively
■ 
Manage risk associated with new, modiﬁ ed, or retired services being transitioned
■ 
Successfully deploy releases into the live environment
■ 
Set the expectations for the performance and use of the new or modiﬁ ed services
■ 
Ensure that the changes to the services deliver the anticipated and required business 
value
■ 
Provide relevant and good-quality knowledge and information about the services and 
service assets
So that we can achieve these objectives, a number of activities and processes have to 
take place as part of the service transition stage. It will be important to ensure that there 
are adequate plans made for the resourcing requirements for the transition, including 
providing the capacity that will be necessary for managing successful change. As part of 
the  preparation for deployment, there needs to be a framework for risk assessment and 
evaluation of the required capabilities so that deployment can be managed efﬁ ciently and 
effectively.
During any transition, it will be necessary to ensure the integrity of the service assets. 
This is important throughout the whole lifecycle but becomes critical when introducing 
new services or changing existing services, because the management of changes to the 
service assets will introduce additional risks to the overall operation of the portfolio 
of services.
One of the key aspects of managing transition is ensuring that there is a well-organized 
manner of delivering the required outcomes, in an efﬁ cient and effective way. This requires 
you to have repeatable mechanisms for all of the activities that need to be carried out as 
part of this lifecycle stage. This includes the build, testing, and deployment of service 
releases, so as part of the transition, we have processes that allow for measureable manage-
ment of these activities.

162 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
Finally, we have to ensure that the outcomes identiﬁ ed in the service design stage are 
delivered effectively into operation. This will include ensuring that the service can be man-
aged, operated, and supported according to the constraints speciﬁ ed as part of service 
design. It is important to ensure, as part of this ﬁ nal activity, that users and support staff 
are adequately trained in the new or changed service or system. This will ensure that the 
new or changed service can be used at the time of deployment.
The Scope of Service Transition 
The service transition stage provides guidance on the development and improvement of the 
capabilities required to deliver new services into the live environment. This covers the plan-
ning, build, test, evaluation, implementation, and deployment of new services or changes 
to existing services. It also provides information and guidance on the transition of services 
between service providers (internal and external) and the retirement of services that are no 
longer required. The guidance covers the relationship between strategy, design, and transi-
tion so that the requirements from service strategy, which are then developed in service 
design, may be successfully realized for operational use, while minimizing the risk and 
disruption of making changes.
The service transition lifecycle stage provides guidance on management and how transi-
tions should work between all types of service providers, no matter what the situation. This 
includes introducing new technologies, working with suppliers and partners, and managing 
working practices.
So, the scope of service transition covers all aspects of introducing new services to the 
operational environment. It will have a close association with project management activity 
and may adopt a project management approach to the coordination of the activities.
The Value of Service Transition to the Business
Service transition offers value by providing guidance on how to adopt and implement 
standard and consistent approaches while delivering changes to services. Taking a consis-
tent approach will enable projects to predict the risks, resources, spend, and timescales 
for delivery more accurately, which will result in the ability to manage higher volumes of 
change.
Because there will be a consistent approach to planning, the transition processes will be 
easier for stakeholders in the activities to follow, and there will be fewer issues with clashes 
of project resource requirements, such as two separate teams requiring access to the same 
testing environments. By working in this way, you will also be able to reduce the effort 
spent on managing test and pilot environments. This will also enable reuse of systems 
and service assets, because a planned approach will enable you to see where reuse can be 
achieved. 
Other beneﬁ ts include increased conﬁ dence on the part of the recipients of any changes, 
because there is clear planned communication, and expectations are correctly set for all 
stakeholders, including customers, users, suppliers, partners, and projects.

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
163
In addition, the overall management of the transition enables control of the assets and 
costs associated with transitions. So, the value to the business is realized in the successful 
transition of new or changed services within budget and according to the speciﬁ cations set 
out in strategy and developed in design.
We are probably all familiar with the project that gets delivered into operation with mini-
mal information, warning, or preparation. It used to be a common occurrence, and the conse-
quent impact to the operational environment in terms of rework and additional effort required 
to begin supporting the project would often have signiﬁ cant additional cost implications.
The transition stage is there to ensure that this no longer happens. Taking the output from 
the service design stage, the service design package (SDP) transition is responsible for ensur-
ing the seamless delivery of new or changed services into the live operational environment.
The next chapters will examine the processes in the service transition stage, which 
enable your services to be transitioned successfully, with the exception of change manage-
ment which is detailed below.
Introduction to the Change 
Management Process
This section covers the change management process. This is one of the process areas we 
cover in detail; when you come to the exam, you can expect to have questions that ask you 
about the activities and concepts of the process as well as the purpose of it. 
It is important to start with an understanding of the purpose, objectives, and scope of the 
process, because this sets the scene for how the process will be used in the service lifecycle. 
We will also cover the activities of the process and the concepts of the types of change 
(normal, standard, and emergency). In addition, we cover the role of the change advisory 
board (CAB) and how the change management process interfaces with the rest of the service 
lifecycle processes.
The Purpose of the Change Management Process
Let’s begin by looking at the purpose of the change management process according to the 
ITIL framework. ITIL states that the purpose of this process is “to control the lifecycle of 
all changes, enabling beneﬁ cial changes to be made with minimum disruption to IT ser-
vices.” This simple statement cuts right to the heart of successful change management for 
an IT department.
If, in an organization that has not adopted best practices, you review your records 
for incidents following a change to your infrastructure, it is very likely that there will be 
an increase in incident volume speciﬁ cally associated to the change that has been made. 
Uncontrolled change may trigger or be the cause of incidents in the infrastructure. Accord-
ing to the IT Service Management Forum (ITSMF), 80 percent of all incidents are caused 
by changes to the IT infrastructure.

164 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
It is for this reason that best practices in service management suggest that change man-
agement should be controlled. But there are other equally compelling reasons to address the 
issues caused by poor change control, not least of which is the reputation of the IT depart-
ment in the eyes of their customers.
This is an extract from a conversation heard in an ofﬁ ce on a Friday afternoon:
“IT is making a change over the weekend, aren’t they?”
“Yes.”
“Then I think I’ll take Monday off to work from home; nothing will be working until 
Tuesday!”
This kind of attitude and expectation can be very damaging to the organization as a 
whole and demonstrates a lack of conﬁ dence in the IT department. Service management is 
about providing your customers with assurance that the IT services and systems that sup-
port the business will work as expected, when required. Unreliable changes that do not 
achieve their beneﬁ ts cause adverse impact on the business as a whole, so the importance of 
controlling the change process is vital to business success.
Equally damaging is unplanned change, and often it is the IT department that carries 
this out. There is not usually malicious intent to bring down the service when making 
unplanned changes; it is much more likely to be carried out by a well-meaning individual 
with the intention of correcting an error that may have an impact on business performance. 
But if this is carried out without careful planning and assessment, there may be unintended 
and unexpected impacts on existing services.
Any failure in the management of change will potentially require additional work and 
rework following the implementation, and this has perhaps the most signiﬁ cant impact of 
uncontrolled change in your organization. It may incur additional costs, for which there may 
be no budget, and this can contribute to the view that IT departments are endless “money 
pits” into which the business pours funds for little perceived reward. 
Objectives of the Change Management Process
The objectives of the process reﬂ ect some of the issues identiﬁ ed in the previous section on 
its purpose. A key objective is to keep abreast of the changes that happen in the business 
environment. This objective speciﬁ cally states that while responding to the changing business 
needs, you should be reducing incidents, disruption to the services, and rework. In this way, 
the process can assist with maximizing the value of the IT services provided to the business. 
It is an important objective to support your business, and as organizational needs evolve, 
the IT department or service provider should continue to ensure that the services align to 
business needs. This will require the management of changes to the services to meet the 
challenges of a changing business.
The next objective identiﬁ ed by the ITIL Service Transition publication begins to show 
the process in action. It states that the service provider should “ensure that changes are 
recorded and evaluated, and that authorized changes are prioritized, planned, tested, imple-
mented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner.” This states the steps of the 

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
165
change management process as a clear objective and sets the expectation for how changes 
should be controlled. Note that the objective stresses authorized changes as part of the pro-
cess ﬂ ow and emphasizes the need for recording changes.
As part of the management of change in the IT environment, one of the objectives for 
successful change management is to control the items recorded in the conﬁ guration manage-
ment system (CMS). This, of course, assumes that the IT service provider has a functioning 
CMS. We will be covering the CMS in Chapter 9, as part of the process of service asset and 
conﬁ guration management (SACM). The SACM process is an important one in the overall 
approach of the service lifecycle, because it helps identify the components that make up our 
services and how they all relate to one another. Once we have made the effort to capture this 
information to maximize its use, it needs to be maintained and kept accurate. The process of 
change management is key for enabling this and ensuring that we have relevant information 
maintained in the CMS.
The ITIL framework also suggests that an additional objective of the change manage-
ment process is to optimize risk for the business. The reason for a change may often be to 
minimize risk, but it is also common to accept risk for a beneﬁ cial result. Often the reason 
for carrying out a change is that the risk of not doing it far outweighs the risk of doing it. 
We will be covering this important aspect when we cover the individual steps of the process 
later in this chapter.
The objectives set the expectations of what will be achieved by the process. 
Scope of the Change Management Process
Change can be looked at in many different ways, so it is extremely important to understand 
the scope for this process so that it can be handled effectively. The ITIL framework deﬁ nes 
a change as “the addition, modiﬁ cation or removal of anything that could have an effect on 
IT services.”
This means the scope of this process covers everything from the architecture and infra-
structure to the processes, documentation, metrics, and tools that support your services, as 
well as changes to IT services and conﬁ guration items. 
With a scope as large as this, it is even more important to ensure the control of the 
environment with a manageable, repeatable process. ITIL suggests that the process should 
cover all stages of the service lifecycle, from strategy right through to operation and into 
continual service improvement. Changes to conﬁ guration items across the lifecycle should 
be managed in a controlled manner, including changes to contracts, agreements, or physi-
cal assets such as servers or networks and virtual assets in a virtualized environment. This 
should also include the management of changes to the ﬁ ve aspects of service design (which 
were covered in Chapter 4):
■ 
Service solutions for new or changed services, which include the resources and capa-
bilities needed for the service and the functional requirements for the solution
■ 
Management systems and tools, particularly the service portfolio, allowing manage-
ment and control of the services throughout their lifecycle
■ 
Management and technology architectures required to deliver the services

166 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
■ 
Processes that support the services by managing design, transition, operation, and 
improvement activities
■ 
Measurement systems, methods, and metrics for the services
Deﬁ ning the changes that are out of scope is equally important for the successful man-
agement of change. Typically these will include changes that have a signiﬁ cantly wider 
impact than just the services themselves, such as changes to departmental structures, 
business policies, or operations. These changes may have associated IT service changes, 
which would be managed through the change process, but the initial management would 
be through business and organizational change processes. But at the other end of the scale, 
the minor operational changes that need to be done as part of day-to-day management of 
the infrastructure may also be excluded from the change management process. Examples of 
these would be routine maintenance changes such as simple repairs to printers.
Management of change needs to take place at all levels of an organization—strategically, 
tactically, and operationally. Agreeing on the scope between the IT service provider, busi-
ness, and any suppliers is essential for success, particularly where there are shared assets 
and a shared responsibility for the delivery of services to the organization. The ability to 
interface our IT change management process with those of the business and the suppliers 
to effect a seamless introduction of change will be a major factor in the successful manage-
ment of changes in a complex environment.
The service portfolio, with its capture of the details relating to all services, including 
current, planned, and retired services, is a valuable tool for understanding the impact of 
changes in a supported environment. 
Changes may be triggered from a variety of situations and still remain in scope for your pro-
cess. Strategic changes may be introduced through a change proposal, whereas design driven 
changes may occur in response to design requirements as part of the development of a new ser-
vice. Service operations or external suppliers may initiate changes that arise from improvement 
initiatives or in response to operational requirements for corrective actions. Change manage-
ment is not responsible for the coordination of processes for the successful implementation of 
projects; this will be handled through the planning and transition support process.
So, deﬁ ning the scope can be complex but is important for the successful management 
of the process and will require negotiation and discussion throughout the organization to 
ensure everyone has a clear understanding and expectation for the management of changes.
Types of Change
Many different types of change exist in operational environments. As we discussed in the 
previous section about the scope of change, it is a wide subject area. A change is captured 
as a formal request for alteration of a conﬁ guration item. There are a number of ways of 
handling this formal request; it could be a service call to the service desk, a completed 
request for change form, or even a project initiation document. A request for change is 
commonly referred to as an RFC.
One of the most common complaints when you try to introduce a new change 
management process is that it is too bureaucratic. There is often reluctance to update 

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
167
 documentation if it is seen as unnecessary with no obvious beneﬁ t to the individual who 
has to complete it. When introducing a request for change form or procedural documenta-
tion, it is advisable to think about the culture of the organization and how processes are 
viewed. If processes are seen as unwieldy and ineffective, if you introduce a complicated 
or overly detailed form for requesting a simple change, then people are unlikely to use it. 
Many people do not like documentation, so the simpler the form and detail required, the 
more likely people are to support the process. So, introducing a formal document to cap-
ture change requests means that you have to be aware of the requirements of the business 
and be sensitive to its needs. The ITIL framework identiﬁ es different types of change, and 
each has a different handling procedure, so you can adapt the request for change (RFC) to 
meet the individual requirements of each change type. 
There is sometimes confusion over the terminology that is used around the change man-
agement process. For clariﬁ cation, the ITIL framework identiﬁ es the difference between a 
change, a request for change, and a change record.
Change The addition, modiﬁ cation, or removal of anything that could have an effect on 
IT services.
Request for Change Formal proposal for altering a conﬁ guration item, recorded either 
electronically or on paper. This is often misused to describe the change record or the 
change itself. It includes details of the change to be completed. RFCs are used only to 
request a change, not to manage and communicate the lifecycle of the change.
Change Record A capture of the details of the lifecycle of a change. A change record 
is raised in response to a request for change—for every change, even those that are 
subsequently rejected. Change records should reference the conﬁ guration items affected 
by the change. They are stored in the conﬁ guration management system or service 
management tool.
Using the Change Model
The ITIL framework also talks about the advisability of using a change model. This is a set 
of predeﬁ ned steps for use in a commonly occurring set of circumstances, allowing par-
ticular changes to be handled consistently in an agreed manner. This can be very useful 
for integration with support tools so that management of the change can be handled by 
automation. The change model should include the following:
■ 
Steps for handling the change
■ 
The order in which the steps should be carried out, including any dependencies
■ 
Responsibilities throughout the process
■ 
Timescales
■ 
Escalation procedures

168 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
Change models can be used to manage speciﬁ c types of change, such as standard 
changes, emergency changes, regular maintenance changes, and service requests from 
users. Now that we have clariﬁ ed the terminology, we’ll cover the different types of change 
that ITIL identiﬁ es: standard change, emergency change, and normal change.
Standard Change
A standard change is a change to a service or other conﬁ guration item, which has a preau-
thorized approach to its execution. These are changes with a well-known and clearly under-
stood risk. Examples of this type of change are the provision of a user proﬁ le for a new 
starter or software download from a standard list or a desktop move for a single user. The 
approach follows a set of predeﬁ ned and agreed steps providing a model that can be used 
and reused consistently. This model will determine the requirements for logging the change, 
handling the change, and implementing the change. It will be an established and tested pro-
cedure that has been proven in practice. The change authority that has the budget for the 
activity grants authorization of the standard change. 
These key elements identify a standard change:
■ 
There is a clearly deﬁ ned trigger for the initiation of the change, such as an exception 
generated by an event management tool or a request via the service desk.
■ 
The actions are understood, proven in practice, and documented.
■ 
Authority is effectively given in advance. 
■ 
Financial authority either is in the control of the requestor or is granted in advance 
under an agreed budget.
■ 
The risk is low or well known and understood.
Example of a Standard Change
The following is an example of a standard change in a working environment. In the car 
manufacturing industry, cars are often sold by franchise garages or dealerships, rather 
than directly from the manufacturer. In one such organization, the manufacturer uses the 
standard change model for the IT requirements when introducing a new dealership. Let’s 
explore whether this use of the standard change meets the speciﬁ cations identiﬁ ed by 
the ITIL framework. The standard change in this case covers a number of activities, each 
of which is documented. The activities are all clearly understood (equipment and soft-
ware are sent to the dealership, user proﬁ les are set up, access proﬁ les are applied to 
the ﬁ rewalls, and so on) and so are the risks. There is a well-known and documented 
trigger for the change. Most importantly, because the decision is in the control of the 

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
169
Introduction of standard changes can greatly enhance the effectiveness of the change 
management process and increase the buy-in for the management of change within the 
organization, because it can be seen as improving responsiveness and efﬁ ciency and mini-
mizing bureaucracy. Each standard change model should be approved and agreed upon 
prior to its use, and the records of the standard changes should be reviewed on a regular 
basis to ensure that there is no adverse impact from the implementation. The content 
of the individual change records for the standard changes will potentially vary, based on 
the requirement of the change itself, but it should contain sufﬁ cient detail to manage the 
change and provide a track record of the activity undertaken.
Emergency Change
Another change type, which has a different model, is the emergency change. This 
type of change is in response to or in order to prevent a business-critical error. There 
is the potential for the impact of a poorly handled emergency change to be greater 
than the incident it is attempting to solve because of tight timescales, reduced assess-
ment, and testing of the change. The number of emergency changes should be kept to 
a minimum, because they are more likely than the other types to be disruptive and 
prone to failure. Ideally, changes should be planned, but emergencies do happen, 
and there needs to be a recognized approach to manage the implementation of 
the response. These procedures take into consideration the need for urgency but 
also the need to have a clear record of the actions that will be carried out in response 
to the emergency.
There needs to be a clear deﬁ nition of the authority levels associated with 
emergency changes, and if that authority has been devolved (perhaps to a duty manager 
on a night shift or manager on call), this should be clearly documented as part of the 
procedures. If it is necessary, emergency changes may have to be assessed by a group 
of people or referred to an advisory board, which is known as the emergency change 
advisory board (ECAB). The ECAB is the emergency authority for assessing emergency 
changes covering the same responsibilities as the change advisory board, which we 
business, the authority for the budget is agreed upon, and the authority for the imple-
mentation of the change is part of the business decision to engage the dealership. So, 
even though this change has a number of activities and involves considerable cost, it has 
been proven, the risks are well known and understood, and it is requested and classed as 
a standard change. It follows a deﬁ ned model, which includes documentation specifying 
each step of the activities, including the lead times for ordering equipment, so that the 
requestors understand the timeframe for the whole activity. It meets the requirements 
for the key elements of a standard change.

170 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
will review in the normal change process. Any decisions to authorize an emergency 
change must be documented in the change record so that there is a clear audit trail 
for all activities.
Once authorized, there may be no time for full testing of the build and implementation 
while the change is carried out. This will increase the risk of failure, so as much testing as 
possible should be completed. It is also recognized that during this activity, there may be 
little time given to the update of the change record, so there is a recommendation that the 
documentation is updated after the implementation. 
So, the key elements of the emergency change approach are as follows:
■ 
Authorization and assessment may be completed by the ECAB rather than waiting for 
a CAB meeting.
■ 
Testing may be reduced or, in extreme cases, be missed completely, if this is an accept-
able risk to resolve the emergency.
■ 
Documentation, once the change record has been raised, may be completed retrospec-
tively.
Emergency changes should not be carried out to address poor planning. 
As can be seen, the approach increases the risk of failure and may cause 
additional issues in the operational environment. So, they should be tightly 
controlled and implemented only when absolutely necessary, according to 
a business-critical need.
Normal Change
The next type of change we are going to review is the normal change. This section will 
cover the normal change process ﬂ ow and the roles and responsibilities of the change advi-
sory board. 
The typical process ﬂ ow includes these steps:
1. 
Create and record the RFC.
2. 
Review the RFC.
3. 
Assess and evaluate the change.
4. 
Authorize the change.
5. 
Plan updates.
6. 
Coordinate change implementation.
7. 
Review and close the change.
We will cover each step of the process in turn (Figure 8.1).

F I G U R E  8 .1 The normal change process
Based on Cabinet Office ITIL material. Reproduced under license from the Cabinet Office.
You can see in Figure 8.1 that there is a reference to a change proposal. A change 
proposal may be required if the change is potentially going to have signiﬁ cant and 
costly impact on the business. Authorizing the proposal for a change means that the 
wider implications can be reviewed against any other changes and proposed new 
services.

172 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
The proposal should include a high-level description of the change, a detailed busi-
ness case including a risk assessment and proﬁ le, and an outline schedule for the design 
and implementation of the change. Once authorized, the proposal will be used as a basis 
for raising the changes required to achieve the requirement or perhaps chartering a new 
service.
The ﬁ rst step of the process is the creation of the request for change (RFC). The 
change can be initiated by anyone within the organization (or supported by the service 
provider), and this request will trigger the creation of a change record. The RFC should 
specify the details of the change, including the risks, beneﬁ ts, costs, and proposed schedule 
for implementation. The level of detail required in the request will depend on the nature of 
the request; for example, a change requiring signiﬁ cant technical engagement should cover 
the tasks in detail. But it may be that the relevant details cannot be provided at the point of 
request, so there needs to be clear guidance on the minimum content required. 
Raising an RFC will trigger the change record. The details and updates captured in the 
change record will be managed through the CMS. We cover the description and use of 
the CMS in the discussion of the service asset and conﬁ guration management process 
in Chapter 9.
Change logging is an important part of the overall change process. Keeping an 
accurate change record provides an audit trail for the actions carried out in the lifecycle of 
the change. All RFCs should be logged with a unique identiﬁ er, and where the trigger 
for the change is captured in another record (such as an incident or problem), the original 
reference number of the initiating document should be captured as part of the change 
record. A good service management tool will have the functionality to link these records 
and be able to capture the relationship between the RFC and any associated conﬁ guration 
items, records, and other service components. It is the responsibility of change management 
to ensure that the change record is created and logged correctly.
Once the change has been raised and logged, the change should be reviewed against 
some basic criteria to establish whether the change should continue through the process:
■ 
Is it completely impractical?
■ 
Has the change been raised and logged with sufﬁ cient information and appropriate 
budget?
■ 
Is it a repeat of an earlier RFC or one that is still being considered, or a previously 
rejected request?
If rejected, the initiator must be provided with a reason for the rejection and have right 
of appeal through normal management channels. This review is the responsibility of the 
change manager but can be carried out by others if there is agreement with the change 
management process owner. For example, for minor changes that require authorization, 
often the line manager of the initiator carries out the review, ensuring that no incomplete 
or impractical changes are raised.
Once the RFC has been accepted into the change process, the next step is that of evalu-
ation and assessment. If the change has a signiﬁ cant impact, it may require a speciﬁ c and 
separate formal evaluation activity; otherwise, the assessment can be managed as part of 

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
173
the normal change process. The framework provides a set of seven questions that 
should be asked during the assessment of a change. These are known as the seven 
Rs of assessment:
■ 
Who raised the change?
■ 
What is the reason for the change?
■ 
What is the return required from the change?
■ 
What are the risks involved in the change?
■ 
What resources are required to deliver the change?
■ 
Who is responsible for the build, test, and implementation of the change?
■ 
What is the relationship between this change and other changes?
Assessment should include all potential factors that may impact the success of the 
change. This may require the RFC to be reviewed by a number of people, and it is the 
responsibility of the change manager to ensure that the assessment is completed. This is 
where the change advisory board is used. We cover the roles and responsibilities of the CAB 
later in this section.
Following the assessment, the change schedule (CS) can be updated. This is an impor-
tant output from the change process and shows the details of all changes authorized for 
implementation and their proposed implementation dates. In fact, this is both an input 
and an output for the process, because the change schedule will need to be consulted when 
considering the scheduling for new changes. The schedule should be published so that all 
interested parties can understand when planned changes are to take place. 
The projected service outage (PSO) document should also be updated at this point, with 
the impact to the business of the service outages clearly identiﬁ ed. This allows stakeholders 
to understand when any additional outages outside of the agreed service level agreement 
will take place and when the planned maintenance outages will take place.
Both the CS and the PSO provide important information for assessing new changes. It is 
the responsibility of change management to ensure that these documents are available and 
accurate for use by the CAB as part of the assessment activity.
Another important element for assessment is the remediation plan. A remediation plan 
should be in place for all changes so that if the change fails, the infrastructure can be returned 
to normal. Often concentration is placed on mitigation against the risk of failure, which is an 
important part of managing a change implementation, but if that mitigation is unsuccessful, 
then return to normal must be considered. This may be achieved by envoking service continu-
ity plans, or back out or rollback plans, dependent on the nature of the change.
While we are engaged in the updates to our plans for the change and producing the 
documented outputs, the change record is updated with the plans for executing the change. 
In Figure 8.1, you can see that there are workﬂ ows associated with this step. This indicates 
the potential requirement for additional activity outside of the assessment itself, perhaps to 
obtain further information to enable an informed recommendation to be made, such as a 
feasibility study for a proposed activity.
Once a recommendation has been made for a change to be authorized, either by the 
change manager or by the CAB, it is time to engage the change authority for approval for 

174 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
the change to be built and tested. This includes prioritization of the change among other 
changes and releases. 
Formal authorization is granted for each change by the change authority, which may be 
a role, person, or group of people. The levels of authorization will be determined by the sig-
niﬁ cance of the change in terms of size, risk, cost, and potential business impact. Change 
authorization is often dependent on the culture of the organization. In a hierarchical 
organization, authorization may be part of that multilevel management structure, whereas 
another organization may take a more streamlined approach.
However the authority is structured, once a decision is made and communicated, there 
should be a right of appeal for the initiator if the change has been rejected at this stage. 
Following authorization of the build and test of the change, the coordination of the 
build, test, and implementation of the change can take place. During this stage, the change 
will be assessed for release, either as part of a release package through the release and 
deployment process or as part of operational release into the production environment. 
You can see in Figure 8.1 that there are workﬂ ows associated with this step in the process 
so that engagement of technical resources can be managed and coordinated to deliver the 
required activity. Change management is responsible for ensuring that this step in the pro-
cess takes place efﬁ ciently.
Once the build and test has been approved, then authorization for the deployment can 
take place.
You can also see workﬂ ows in the diagram associated with the coordination of the 
deployment step, indicating that activity outside the change management process may take 
place. The actual work of deployment is managed through the release and deployment pro-
cess. Activities to plan, create, and deploy releases are part of the responsibility of the release 
and deployment process. Change management’s responsibility during deployment is coordi-
nating the activity being carried out if it is a simple change that is not part of a release. 
Change management is responsible for ensuring that the changes are deployed as sched-
uled. The role of coordination will be shared with release and deployment management. 
Any release activity should be scheduled to minimize the impact to the business.
Finally, we come to the review and closure of the change. In this step, the change is 
evaluated to ensure that the actual performance has been achieved. If this has been real-
ized, the change can be closed. But closure should take place only after a period of time has 
passed, so the true effects of the change can be assessed. All feedback should be captured 
and presented to the CAB or the change authority via the change process.
Where a change has not met the acceptance criteria for success, change management 
may identify a number of options. If it is possible, the change can undergo remediation and 
return to normal, or if this is not possible, then additional changes can be raised to cor-
rect any issues. These will be managed through the change process, and once the original 
change meets its acceptance criteria, it can be closed. It may also be agreed on that nothing 
will be done to achieve the original success criteria, if the business agrees that what has 
been delivered is sufﬁ cient to meet their needs.
Whatever the decision made, once closure has been agreed, this should be recorded as 
part of the change record, and the record should be closed. This is change management’s 
responsibility.

Introduction to the Change Management Process 
175
Throughout the process, any activities associated with the role of the 
change manager may be carried out by a change practitioner, a change 
authority or the change management process owner, or a change manage-
ment team, dependent on the size and structure of the organization.
The Role of the Change Advisory Board
The change advisory board (CAB) is a group of people brought together to review and assess 
changes to determine whether they should be authorized. In some organizations, the CAB 
will also act as the change authority for certain levels of change, but the main role is to pro-
vide advice and guidance. The makeup of the group is entirely dependent on the RFCs that 
are under discussion. The membership will, therefore, potentially change for each meeting. 
It is important to ensure that the group consists of all those who have an interest in the out-
come of the change. This should include a customer representative who can assess the busi-
ness impact of a change and also a technical representative who can assess the change for the 
requirements relating to the infrastructure. There will be a number of stakeholders involved 
in the execution of the change, including suppliers, and they should also be represented as 
part of the CAB. You may be familiar with a CAB in your own organization or, using your 
own experience, be able to identify the relevant roles who might attend a CAB in your own 
company. It is potentially quite a large group of people, and it may be quite challenging to 
arrange a meeting that all can attend face to face. Some organizations address this by hold-
ing “virtual” meetings, either through conference calls or electronically via email. Others 
adopt an approach that has a tightly controlled meeting schedule, and the relevant people 
are called in for the appropriate time slot to discuss the RFC that affects them.
To ensure the meeting is productive and efﬁ cient, it is the responsibility of the change 
manager to circulate the RFCs for discussion prior to the meeting. This means that each 
person can review the RFC and gather any relevant information that will aid in the discus-
sion and decision making. 
As the assessment is carried out, it is important that the CAB has visibility of all changes 
that are being considered or have already been approved. This will ensure that the RFC 
under review can be assessed for the impact and relationship to other changes. 
The CAB Meeting
There should be a standard agenda for a CAB meeting, including the following:
■ 
Change proposals
■ 
RFCs to be assessed (prioritized in a structured approach)
■ 
RFCs that have been assessed
■ 
Change reviews

176 
Chapter 8 ■ Understanding Service Transition and Processes
How the Change Management Process Interfaces 
with Other Service Management Processes
We begin by looking at the service transition processes that have an interface to change 
management, but it is important to remember that change management affects the entire 
service lifecycle, from strategy to continual service improvement.
There needs to be a close relationship between change management and transition plan-
ning and support so that transitions can be coordinated successfully.
Relationships between change management and release and deployment management 
should be carefully integrated with the project management and business change processes 
so that clear boundaries and dependencies can be established for transitions that involve 
project management. This may also include working with suppliers, so supplier manage-
ment should engage with change management to ensure that all activity can be coordi-
nated. If the change has a wide impact or scope within the organization, there may be other 
business processes that need to work with change management.
The process of change evaluation in the service transition phase is not covered speciﬁ -
cally in the foundation course syllabus, but the concept of change evaluation is there to 
ensure that you have a review and evaluation of the actual performance of the change 
against the predicted performance as speciﬁ ed in the change proposal. Change management 
has to be able to integrate with change evaluation and should be able to indicate which 
changes are to be subjected to formal evaluation. Change management provides the trigger 
for change evaluation, and the timescales required for the evaluation should be part of the 
overall planning for the change, because the evaluation report will be an important input to 
the CAB or other change authority when making decisions on authorization.
When we consider the integration and cooperation between business processes, pro-
gram and project management processes, and organizational change processes with change 
management, it is important to understand the requirements for supporting these activi-
ties even though they are outside the scope of change management. Change management 
■ 
Outstanding changes and progress updates on current changes
■ 
Updates from and to the schedule of changes, and planned service outages identi-
ﬁ ed
■ 
Failed changes, backed-out changes, or unauthorized changes
■ 
Proposed changes for future assessment at CAB
This agenda should remain ﬂ exible enough to allow for the review of all necessary 
change activity that has taken place since the last CAB meeting. There is no ﬁ xed interval 
for the frequency of CAB meetings; this is driven by the volume and nature of IT change 
taking place in the organization.

Summary 
177
 representatives may be called on to attend meetings associated with these business pro-
grams so that all approaches can be consistently delivered.
Integration with other service management process is also vital for the success of change 
management. Many processes are going to interface with change because they will raise 
changes in response to either operational outages or improvement initiatives. Service 
asset and conﬁ guration management has very strong connections to change management, 
because the information it captures about the overall infrastructure provides valuable 
data that can be used for the assessment of change impact on the environment. Problem 
management raises changes and has a responsibility to attend the CAB for inclusion in the 
assessment activity for those changes. Processes such as information security and IT  service 
continuity management need to be included in the change management assessment for 
the impact of changes on the security policies and continuity plans. Capacity and demand 
management are also critical in change assessment and may raise changes to address new 
requirements for capacity to meet altered demands. Service portfolio management  provides 
input for the change assessment activity and may be responsible for raising strategic 
changes to address new requirements for the business. Service level management needs to 
be included in the change assessment to ensure that the agreed-on service targets will not be 
impacted. Availability management will also be a key process in the assessment of changes, 
because many of the business-critical targets will involve the availability of services.
This is only a selection of the processes that relate to change management, but it does 
show the breadth of engagement that change management has throughout the service 
lifecycle.

Exam Essentials
Be able to recall the purpose, objectives, and scope of service transition. The purpose 
is to ensure that new, modiﬁ ed, or retired services meet the expectations of the business 
as agreed on in strategy and design. The objectives are to plan and successfully manage 
releases into production, ensuring good knowledge transfer and expectation setting for 
the delivery of the new or modiﬁ ed service. The scope covers the planning, build, testing, 
evaluation, implementation, and deployment of new or modiﬁ ed services into the live envi-
ronment or the retirement of services.
Be able to identify the value service transition provides to the business. This lifecycle 
stage provides value by delivering changes that are planned, built, tested, evaluated, imple-
mented, and deployed according to expectation and speciﬁ cation, enabling controlled man-
agement of new or changed services into operation.
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the change management process. 
The purpose of this process is to provide controlled change. The objectives are to manage 
changes in a controlled manner, managing risk and meeting the needs of the business, now 
and in the future. The scope of the process covers IT changes, not business or organiza-
tional changes, and is not used for minor IT operational changes.
Be able to identify a change model. The change model is used to assist with management 
of the process, by providing a set of predeﬁ ned steps for commonly identiﬁ ed situations.
Be able to identify a standard change. A standard change follows a recognized change 
model, responds to a predeﬁ ned trigger, has a predeﬁ ned approach, has clearly understood 
or low risk, and is effectively preauthorized by the change authority.
Understand the process for an emergency change. An emergency change follows an 
adjusted process ﬂ ow from the normal process; assessment and authorization may 
include the ECAB, testing may be reduced, and the documentation may be completed 
retrospectively.
Be able to recall the steps and activities of the normal change process flow. You will need 
to be familiar with the steps and activities of the normal process as previously detailed on 
the normal change process ﬂ ow.
Understand the types of documentation for the change process and their uses. All 
changes should be documented in an RFC, and this should be logged in a change record, 
which is captured as part of the CMS. A change proposal is needed only if the change has a 
major impact on the business in terms of risk, cost, or resources.
Be able to identify the elements that are used for assessment of changes. The assessment 
of a change should include the beneﬁ ts, costs, risks, resources, and relationships for the 
change. 

Exam Essentials 
179
Be able to recall the output documentation from the process. The change schedule (CS) 
and projected service outage (PSO) documents are outputs of the change process and are 
used to communicate change timescales and impact with stakeholders. 
Understand the purpose of the remediation plan. The remediation plan allows mitigation 
against potential failure and return to normal if a change fails.
Understand how changes are authorized and by whom. Changes are authorized for 
action by the change authority, dependent on the size, risk, cost, and business impact of the 
change. 
Understand the responsibilities of change management in respect of release and deploy-
ment of changes and how change management interfaces with other processes. Change 
management is responsible for the coordination of the deployment of the change and will 
work with release and deployment management. Change management interfaces with many 
other service management and business processes across the service lifecycle.
Be able to identify how a change is closed. Once a change has been deployed, it should be 
reviewed, and the change record can be closed, once it has met the acceptance criteria for 
success. 
Understand the responsibilities of the change advisory board. The change advisory board 
(CAB) is responsible for assessing changes and making recommendation for authorization.

We have covered the change management process in some 
detail, but these remaining processes do not require such an 
in-depth consideration for the Foundation syllabus. As a result, 
we will review only the purpose, objectives, and scope for each process, as well as some of 
the basic process steps and concepts.
In fact, the list of processes for service transition is longer than the list of processes we 
will be reviewing. The following processes are also included in this lifecycle stage:
■ 
Service validation and testing
■ 
Change evaluation
These last two processes are not covered in the syllabus, so you will not have any 
questions in your exam that relate to them. But so that you are aware of their content, here 
is a brief outline for each:
■ 
Service validation and testing, is, as the title suggests, the process that ensures 
the service will perform as speciﬁ ed and be designed through service strategy and 
service design. It is when you engage with your customers and users to complete the 
required testing of the new or changed service.
■ 
Change evaluation is the process that allows you to check the predicted performance 
against the actual performance achieved by the new or changed service.
Both of these processes are important for service transition as a whole but are outside of 
the syllabus scope for Foundation.
Transition Planning and Support
Let’s begin by looking at the transition planning and support process, which is a key 
 process for the service transition lifecycle stage. Setting up the transition and how it will 
be managed is crucial for the successful release of your new service into the operational 
environment. It is a very detailed area of the lifecycle and covers the interface between 
service transition, project management, and business engagement. It is here that you are 
looking at the resources and capabilities required to deliver your service design into the live 
environment, in the service operation lifecycle stage.
In the Foundation exam syllabus, this process is covered only by the requirement to 
understand the purpose, scope, and objectives of the process. More information about this 
process is available in the Lifecycle core publication of Service Transition, and further 
education on the process can be found in the ITIL qualiﬁ cation scheme.

Transition Planning and Support 
185
The Purpose of Transition Planning and Support
The purpose of transition planning and support is as the title of the process suggests: to 
plan the transition activities. But of course, that is very simplistic, and there are more 
things to consider.
The need to plan transition activity should be clear, because there are so many disparate 
activities that need to be undertaken. Think about the different processes that exist in this 
lifecycle stage—everything from managing change through release and deployment, service 
validation and testing, and change evaluation all the way to managing service assets and 
conﬁ guration items. The key purpose of the transition planning and support process is to 
coordinate the required resources that will be employed during the transition.
When carrying out a transition, it may be necessary to engage with the technical and 
application management functions to obtain the necessary resources for managing the 
activity and ensuring that all aspects of the transition are carried out by staff with 
the relevant capabilities.
Technical and Application Management Functions
Technical Management Function Custodian of expertise relating to management of 
the IT infrastructure. This function provides resources for managing the infrastructure 
in the service operation lifecycle stage and for other lifecycle stages, such as service 
transition and service design.
Application Management Function Custodian of expertise relating to managing 
applications. This function provides resources for managing applications in the service 
operation lifecycle stage and for other lifecycle stages, such as service transition and 
service design.
There will be considerations regarding the impact of utilizing existing operational 
staff to help in the transition, and this needs to be managed appropriately to minimize 
service impact.
It is important to remember that during a transition, it is not only the IT staff members 
who will need to engage in the activities; you also need to have support and involvement 
from the business and user community. They will need to be included in the testing of the 
transition to ensure that the requirements speciﬁ ed in strategy and the solutions developed 
in design are delivered successfully to meet the requirements of the business.
So, in transition planning and support, there needs to be a careful assessment of the 
resources and capabilities across all of the stakeholders, as well as appropriate scheduling 
of the transition planned to ensure that these are available when they are needed.

186 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
The Objectives of Transition Planning and Support
The objectives of the transition planning and support process are to do the following:
■ 
Plan and coordinate the resources for the transition. It is important to plan this so that 
the requirements identiﬁ ed in service strategy, which were captured in service design, 
are effectively realized in service operation.
■ 
Coordinate all of the various sources for the transitional activity. This may include 
projects and service teams but also includes suppliers if third-party engagement is 
involved in the transition.
■ 
Meet the predicted budget, timeframe, and quality estimates as the new or 
changed service is established in the supported environment. Meeting the estimated 
cost, quality, and time allocation is an important factor for demonstrating the 
efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the transitional activity and contributes to customer 
satisfaction.
■ 
Establish the new requirements as speciﬁ ed in the service design stage for the man-
agement systems and tools that will be part of the new service in operation. This will 
include the service management tools, as well as the management and technology 
architectures as deﬁ ned in the service solution. There may also be new  requirements 
for service management processes for the new or changed services, as well as 
 measures and metrics to be established in order to deliver the required results and 
service quality.
■ 
Ensure that repeatable processes are adopted by all engaged in the transition. 
Developing a framework of reusable processes and systems that can improve the 
efﬁ ciency of future transitions is an important part of this process. It will mean that 
the coordination and planning will continue to improve over time, delivering long-term 
beneﬁ ts to the overall operation.
■ 
Provide clear and comprehensive plans for the transition. These will be made available 
to the business and project teams for alignment with their change plans. It is extremely 
important to ensure that business and project teams are aware of the IT service 
changes and plans so that the overall approach can be managed and aligned to meet 
the needs and expectations of the business in a realistic timeframe.
■ 
Identify and manage risks, in accordance with the risk management framework 
adopted by the organization. This will include controlling risks, as well as mitigating 
them to minimize disruption and failure of the transition. It is important to identify 
risks and make the relevant stakeholders and decision makers aware of them so that 
appropriate actions can be taken to safeguard against failure and disruption in 
the transition.
■ 
Monitor and improve the process of transition planning and support and the service 
transition lifecycle stage.

Service Asset and Configuration Management 
187
The Scope of Transition Planning and Support
The scope of service transition planning and support covers the following:
■ 
The maintenance of the policies and standards that are to be applied throughout the 
transition. This is important to ensure that the repeatable activity is managed appro-
priately and that you maximize the use of models for an efﬁ cient approach.
■ 
Providing guidance for each new service or major change through the transition 
processes.
■ 
Ensuring that the resources and management required for multiple transitions to take 
place at the same time are available. It is unlikely that there will be only one change, 
project, or new service introduction taking place at any one time. Transition planning 
should recognize and coordinate the efforts required for this to happen successfully.
■ 
Prioritizing the resources required for transition may be required because conﬂ icts 
over usage may occur. An example of this would be the use of the test environment by 
multiple projects or changes.
■ 
Planning for future transition requirements in terms of budget and resources. 
Consideration should be given to business requirements that are currently being 
handled in the design stage so that any additional resources can be ordered or allocated 
in a timely manner.
■ 
Reviewing process activities for performance improvement opportunities.
■ 
Ensuring the coordination of the transition and planning process with business 
program and project processes and the activities taking place in the service design 
lifecycle stage.
Transition planning and support should not cover the detailed plans for build, test, and 
deployment for individual changes or releases, because the processes of change manage-
ment and release and deployment management will cover this. Its scope and purpose is at 
a higher level, ensuring the coordination of multiple activities toward the deployment of 
changes into the live operational environment.
Service Asset and Configuration 
Management
One of the key ways that an IT department can show its efﬁ ciency is by demonstrating 
that it has control over the assets it manages. Remember, the services that IT provides are 
crucial to the support of the business, and you must try to deliver these in the most efﬁ cient 
and effective manner possible.

188 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
In this process, you look at the ways you can establish a logical model of the infrastruc-
ture to assist service management. Capturing accurate information about your components 
and service assets will enable you to be more efﬁ cient in the delivery of services.
The elements we will be reviewing in this section are the purpose, objectives, and scope 
of the process; the concepts of the conﬁ guration management system, conﬁ guration man-
agement database, and conﬁ guration items; and the conﬁ guration model and the deﬁ nitive 
media library.
The Purpose of the SACM Process
The purpose of the service asset and conﬁ guration management (SACM) process is to 
ensure that you are able to control the assets that make up your services. To achieve that 
control, it will be necessary to understand what each of those assets are and how they 
are connected to each other.
Managing the assets that make up your services can be a complicated task in distrib-
uted environments. Components of your services may be in diverse locations, managed 
by a wide variety of teams; and the more complex your technology architecture, the more 
involved the management becomes.
Identifying the assets is only part of the requirement; you also need to ensure you 
have accurate records about them. This is a challenging task for any department. The 
information captured should include the relationships between the assets, to maximize 
the use of the data. Understanding the relationships between the items will aid in the man-
agement of the infrastructure and the identiﬁ cation of the impact of changes, by showing 
the connections between the infrastructure items. Corporate asset management simply 
provides a list of the items; service asset and conﬁ guration management shows the relation-
ships between items and allows for a greater understanding of how all the elements of the 
infrastructure depend on each other.
If appropriate, you should capture not only the relationships between items but also 
their conﬁ guration. It is important to capture appropriate information so that the full ben-
eﬁ t of the information can be realized. It will be necessary to understand what the data will 
be used for within the organization so that the level of detail can be agreed upon as part of 
the process.
So, part of the purpose of SACM is to ensure you have accurate meaningful and relevant 
information about your assets.
The Objectives of the SACM Process
The objectives of the SACM process are to do the following:
■ 
Ensure the assets that are under the control of the IT department are properly 
managed. This means the assets need to be identiﬁ ed and, once identiﬁ ed, controlled 
throughout their lifecycles. Managing the assets that make up your services is an 
important part of the governance and control you should have to support your 
organization.

Service Asset and Configuration Management 
189
■ 
Capture information about the services you provide. This requires you to identify, 
control, and record the services and conﬁ guration items you use to support your 
businesses. Once this information is captured, you need to report on and audit the 
data, allowing you to verify the conﬁ guration of the services and how they support 
the business. This should include versions, baselines, and constituent components 
of the services, attributes, and relationships about the services.
■ 
Manage the integrity of the conﬁ guration items (CIs) that make up the services. We 
expand on conﬁ guration items later in this chapter, but essentially it is an item of infra-
structure that is managed to deliver a service. This should include accounting for and 
protecting the conﬁ guration items by using the change management process to ensure 
that only properly authorized items are in use in the infrastructure. Change manage-
ment should be used to control the lifecycle of CIs so that only authorized changes can 
be carried out.
■ 
Establish an accurate and maintained conﬁ guration management system, enabling the 
sustained control and integrity of the components and services. Creating a viable 
conﬁ guration management system is a very important aspect of the SACM process.
■ 
Maintain historical, planned, and current information about the state of conﬁ guration 
items and services as part of the control and management of the infrastructure. By 
capturing historic and planned status, it will be possible to use the information for 
trending and modeling, so its accuracy will be important.
■ 
Support efﬁ cient and effective service management processes, by providing information 
that allows accurate decision making by service providers in the delivery of services. 
This information is a crucial part of other service management processes, and it is 
sometimes said that SACM underpins and supports the entire lifecycle.
The Scope of the SACM Process
The process of SACM is there to identify the elements of the infrastructure that are to be 
managed as service assets and then to apply controls to that management. Service assets 
that are to be managed throughout their lifecycle, in order to deliver services, are known 
as conﬁ guration items (CI). Other assets that cannot be managed in this way, even though 
they are part of the overall service delivery, are not conﬁ guration items. All conﬁ guration 
items are service assets, but not all service assets will be classiﬁ ed and managed as conﬁ gu-
ration items. An example of this is a server; this would be classed as both an asset and a 
conﬁ guration item. But the knowledge used by the support technician to manage the server 
would not be classed as a conﬁ guration item, even though it is obviously an important 
service asset. To extend this example, the information stored on the server, although it is a 
valuable asset, is also not classiﬁ ed as a conﬁ guration item.
In the case of virtual infrastructure, a virtual server may still be classiﬁ ed as a 
conﬁ guration item and service asset, and even though it is as intangible as “knowledge” 
or “information,” it will still need the same management controls applied as its physical 
counterpart.

190 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
So, the scope of the process includes the management of all conﬁ guration items through-
out their lifecycle.
Providing control over the entire lifecycle of a conﬁ guration item, and all conﬁ guration 
items that make up your services, requires a substantial amount of effort. The scope of this 
effort should be managed across the whole of the service lifecycle. It requires that all CIs 
be baselined (that is, identifying and agreeing upon the state of the infrastructure at a given 
point in time), maintained, and controlled through change management. Using the change 
management process will also help ensure that there is control over the management of 
releases into the production environment. No release should take place without the 
necessary authorization, which is part of the change process.
Capturing all this information is done by creating the conﬁ guration management 
system (CMS). This system allows you to develop a logical model of the infrastructure, 
which provides details of the relationships among all of the CIs. Known as a conﬁ guration 
model, this is an important tool for service management processes.
Other items that make up the services, perhaps not traditionally captured as assets 
by the other parts of the organization such as work products (for example, organization 
models, process documentation, roles, and responsibilities in a RACI matrix), may be 
classiﬁ ed as CIs in the CMS.
The scope will also include any interfaces that may exist with internal and external 
conﬁ guration items, such as any shared assets that are part of the service provision.
In most organizations, there will be an existing business process for managing ﬁ xed 
assets. Some of these assets will be under the management of IT and will need to be 
included in the CMS as CIs. It will be important to ensure that there is cooperation 
between the two areas so that the management of these assets is maintained appropriately.
Conﬁ guration item information may be stored in smaller databases, known as 
conﬁ guration management databases (CMDBs). The conﬁ guration management system can 
be made up of a number of CMDBs, because the management and accuracy of a local 
database may be more effectively achieved. The CMS takes a federated approach to 
managing the data.
The Description and Definition of Configuration Items
We have spoken a lot about conﬁ guration items throughout the purpose, objectives, and 
scope of SACM, so it is important that we provide some full deﬁ nitions according the 
process framework:
Service Asset Any resource or capability that could contribute to the delivery of a service. 
Examples include a virtual server, a physical server, and the knowledge in the support team 
to ﬁ x the server.
Configuration Item A service asset that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT 
service. All CIs are service assets, but many service assets are not conﬁ guration items. 
Examples include a server and software license documentation. Every CI must be under the 
control of conﬁ guration management.

Service Asset and Configuration Management 
191
Configuration Record A set of attributes and relationships about a CI. Conﬁ guration 
records are stored in a conﬁ guration management database that allows for localized 
management of the data source and is managed with a conﬁ guration management system. 
It is important to recognize the distinction that CIs are not stored in the CMDB; it is the 
information about the CIs that is stored there, in a conﬁ guration record.
These deﬁ nitions are important both for taking the exam and as part of the process 
of SACM.
The concept of the conﬁ guration item is particularly important. As stated earlier, a 
conﬁ guration item is a service asset that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT 
service. The type, size, and complexity of conﬁ guration items may vary widely, from 
a single module of software to a complete system or service, including all hardware, 
software, and documentation. Conﬁ guration items may be managed by grouping individual 
items together, as in a release.
One of the most crucial factors is to deﬁ ne the level of detail required to manage 
conﬁ guration items successfully. If there is too much detail, it will be difﬁ cult to accurately 
maintain and keep up-to-date the information about them; if there is too little information, 
then the CMS will not be useful enough. Conﬁ guration items should be identiﬁ ed, grouped 
together, and classiﬁ ed in a way that makes it possible to manage and trace them through-
out the service lifecycle.
ITIL suggests a number of different categories for classifying CIs. These are only sugges-
tions; each organization will have to agree on their own categories and the level of detail 
for each CI, whether an item is a CI in its own right or simply an attribute of another CI. 
For example, is a desktop PC a CI on its own, with attributes listed as memory, hard 
drive capacity, monitor, and so on, or are each of these elements identiﬁ ed as CIs that will 
be under management control?
The categories suggested by ITIL are as follows:
Service Lifecycle CIs Examples include the business case, service management plans, and 
the service design package. These are documents that provide information on the plans 
and requirements for the services, including costs and beneﬁ ts.
Service CIs Examples include service capability assets such as management, processes, 
and people; service resource assets such as ﬁ nancial capital, infrastructure, people; and 
service model; service package; release package; and service acceptance criteria.
Organization CIs Examples include documentation relating to organizational policies 
or standards.
Internal CIs Examples include assets delivered by projects such as software or hardware.
External CIs Examples include external customer requirements and agreements.
Interface CIs Examples include documentation relating to end-to-end service provision 
across multiple service providers.

Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
The Description of the Configuration Model
Service asset and conﬁ guration management provides a model of the services, assets, and 
infrastructure by capturing the details of each conﬁ guration item and their relationships to 
each other. You can see an example of this in Figure 9.1.

Integrated into a service management system, the conﬁ guration model can provide 
important detail for the support of many service management processes. Imagine the 
beneﬁ ts of having this level of connectivity of information about your infrastructure for use 
by the service desk. A user calls the service desk, and once the analyst has identiﬁ ed them 
in the system, information about the services, the infrastructure, and the service level 
agreements they use can be immediately accessible. The same detail can also be used 
for assessing changes, allowing complete understanding of the interdependencies when 
 proposing to alter a CI. Information relating to cost will be available in the system, for use 
in ﬁ nancial management. Design for new or changed services will also make use of the 
conﬁ guration management system, enabling future enhancements to the infrastructure to 
be planned effectively and efﬁ ciently.
One of the key beneﬁ ts of the system is that it is a consolidation of all the information 
sources into a single repository. That repository can consist of a number of smaller 
databases, linked so that the information can be connected to maximize the beneﬁ ts of 
gathering the data.

Service Asset and Configuration Management 
193
The level of detail captured will depend on the value of information to the organization, 
the ability to manage the data, and whether it is feasible to maintain the level of change 
control required to ensure accuracy. This has to be an organizational choice, and it is part 
of the process to ensure that this is planned and executed in a controlled manner.
Using the Configuration Management System
The conﬁ guration management system is the system you use to manage the conﬁ guration 
model and deliver the information to those who need it. It is therefore extremely important 
to ensure that the tool is both ﬁ t for purpose and ﬁ t for use, just as you would with a 
system or service being provided directly to your customers and users.
The CMS holds all the information about the CIs that have been identiﬁ ed as part 
of the process of SACM. Figure 9.2 shows the relationship between the conﬁ guration 
records, actual CIs, and the larger, more complex service knowledge management system 
(SKMS), of which the CMS is a part.

F I G U R E 9. 2 Relationship between CMS and SKMS

194 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
The SKMS (which we will cover in more detail in the “Knowledge Management” 
section) is an overarching system of tools and databases, used for managing all information 
relating to service management knowledge throughout the service lifecycle. Many CIs are 
available in the form of knowledge or information (for example, a service level agreement 
or a report template), and these items will be stored as part of the SKMS. SACM is not 
responsible for the management of the SKMS.
The CMS may include information from a number of conﬁ guration management 
databases, which allows for the localized management of the data source. Capturing 
information for a speciﬁ c site, location, or section of the infrastructure may be easier to 
manage in smaller segments. However, each CMDB must be constructed with the intention 
of integration into the CMS, so the naming conventions, structure, and deﬁ nitions of the 
data captured must support overall management through the CMS.
Populating the CMS can be achieved by integrating existing information sources and 
using discovery tools to automatically update or capture information about the infrastruc-
ture. These tools can be used to populate CMDBs and then used to verify the accuracy of 
the information as ongoing maintenance. Although some information may already be in 
existence in organizations in spreadsheets or databases, wherever possible this should be an 
automated activity.
All changes to CIs should be managed under the change management process, and 
any related records and information held in the CMS should be updated as part of 
this activity. As the CMS maintains the relationships between records such as incidents, 
problems, known errors, changes, and releases, it is important to ensure that all records are 
maintained accurately and link to the speciﬁ c CIs affected in each case.
One of the many beneﬁ ts of the CMS is the ability to capture and agree on baselines, 
identifying and agreeing on the state of the infrastructure at a given point in time. 
Baselines are reviewed and agreed for accuracy and used as a reference point for future 
activities. Baselines can provide support for the design and planning activities in the 
service lifecycle, providing historical information or a rollback point for major changes 
to the live environment. It is also possible to capture a snapshot of the infrastructure, 
which although unveriﬁ ed and not reviewed (meaning it may contain errors and 
inaccuracies) is a valuable tool for problem management or the initial assessment of 
success after a release.
Using a CMS means the data is captured by a multilayer mechanism, as deﬁ ned by the 
structure of the SKMS. In this way, you have the ability to capture a variety of information 
sources, which are then integrated by the information integration layer. Ensuring these are 
manageable and provide a useful resource, you have a knowledge processing layer and a 
presentation layer providing access to the information in a usable state.
The integration of various information sources to support the delivery of services is 
a vital part of service management effectiveness and efﬁ ciency, including business informa-
tion sources, such as HR information.
In Figure 9.3 you can see the different layers of the CMS, their relationship to the 
SKMS, and additional information sources.

Service Asset and Configuration Management 
195
Using the Definitive Media Library
As we have discussed, some information sources may exist outside of the SKMS or CMS, 
but there are also aspects of your services that are captured as records in the CMS or 
SKMS but are in fact physical libraries or stores.
Secure stores or libraries allow you to manage those elements of your infrastructure or 
CIs that you need to ensure retain their integrity, outside of their operational use. Consider 
the use of authorized software, purchased under license from a third party. You should 
ensure you keep a master copy of the software and its associated license documentation in 
a secure store for use in service continuity situations or to maintain a “clean” version for 
reinstallation should there be any issues of data integrity in the live environment. This will 
also apply to unlicensed software developed in-house by your organization.
Records of these CIs should be captured and managed in your CMS (perhaps as a spe-
ciﬁ c CMDB), and in this way you can validate and control the use of the software versions 
in the live environment. SACM has a large part to play in license management and will be 
supported by release and deployment management to ensure that only authorized versions 
are used in the live environment.

F I G U R E 9. 3 Architecture of the CMS

196 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
Management of the secure library or store should be achieved by SACM controls 
through change management. The physical store may be actual disks or documents, 
but there may also be electronic stores if much of your software and its associated docu-
mentation is managed electronically. However the media is captured, the deﬁ nitive media 
library (DML) is managed to ensure the integrity and security of the authorized versions of 
software in use in the live environment.
In reality, the DML may consist of a number of software libraries or ﬁ le storage areas, 
which are managed and kept separate from the live, test, or development storage areas.
Hardware spares may also need to be controlled, but although this will also be managed 
by a secure physical store, this is not managed through the DML but as part of the overall 
management of the infrastructure through the CMS.
It will be important, as part of the planning for SACM, to deﬁ ne the structure, 
scope, and content of the DML. Consideration will need to be given to the security 
arrangements for the physical store but also for the security of any electronic media. Basic 
procedures for backing up electronic media and procedures for ensuring physical data stor-
age is still viable will need to be created. There is no point in having physical data storage if 
you ﬁ nd that the master copy has lost integrity when you need to restore it. Archiving and 
changes to technology also need to be considered when managing the DML. What will be 
the retention policy; how frequently will versions be archived, and which versions of the 
software will be managed? Will only the latest version be archived, or should the previous 
versions of software be included?
Information about all CIs held in the secure libraries or physical stores will be held as 
records in the CMS, and the policies that control the management of the DML will form 
part of the SKMS.
Knowledge Management
Knowledge management is a process that impacts the wider service lifecycle, not just 
service transition. This process provides you with one of the key systems for service 
management, the service knowledge management system.
In this process, you will be considering the purpose, objectives, and scope of knowledge 
management, as well as the concepts of the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) 
model and the SKMS.
The Purpose of Knowledge Management
The purpose of knowledge management is to ensure that ideas, perspectives, experience, 
and information are shared and that this is delivered at the right time and to the right place 
to enable informed decision making. You should try to reuse, not rediscover knowledge, 
so that you are more efﬁ cient.

Knowledge Management 
197
Let’s consider that statement in more detail. What are the right information, ideas, expe-
rience, and perspectives? These have to be considered in the context of the audience. What 
may be the right information for the IT department may be completely inappropriate for 
your customers, because it needs to be put into a context that the customer can understand. 
So, when you present information, you should be aware of the needs of the audience 
receiving it. Shared experience and ideas should be considered in this way so that relevant 
experiences and ideas are provided. It is very important to understand the perspectives 
that exist within your organization so that you can attempt to achieve a shared cultural 
perspective to improve the effectiveness of your cooperation across the organization.
The statement also talks about an informed decision. Here you need to think about the 
decision maker, so the appropriate person needs to be able to make a decision. Sometimes 
the decisions will be at a low level; at other times, it will be high-level strategic decision 
making. In either case, you need to ensure that the decisions can be made, so your informa-
tion needs to be relevant.
Therefore, the purpose of knowledge management is to deliver relevant information, 
ideas, experiences, and perspectives to the correct audience so that they can make an 
informed decision.
If you capture these ideas, experiences, and information, you will be able to reuse them 
in order to continue to make decisions based on both new and historical information. The 
reuse of knowledge is a key concept in the process.
The Objectives of Knowledge Management
The objectives of knowledge management are to do the following:
■ 
Improve the quality of decision making throughout the service lifecycle. The quality 
of decisions made must rest on the quality of the information provided to the decision 
maker. If the information provided is inaccurate or unreliable, then a considered 
decision cannot properly be achieved. So, this process should strive to ensure that 
the information provided is accurate, relevant, and secure for a decision to be made, 
throughout all of the lifecycle.
Enable efﬁ ciency in the service provider and customer by encouraging the reuse of 
information. It is a key concept in the framework that you should use repeatable 
processes to deliver an efﬁ cient service, and the use of information should also be 
repeatable. Rediscovering the same knowledge is inefﬁ cient, so the drive from the pro-
cess of knowledge management is to ensure you have captured your information in a 
repeatable and accessible format. If you manage to reduce the time taken to rediscover 
knowledge, then the efﬁ ciencies made will result in higher-quality services and greater 
customer satisfaction. This in turn can reduce the total cost of ownership for the ser-
vices you deliver.
■ 
Ensure that staff members have an understanding of the value of their services. Under-
standing the value of the services can be achieved only through the knowledge and 
experience shared between the business and IT communities within an organization. 

198 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
Once you have established a clear and common understanding of the value of the 
services by communication with your user base, you can begin to make genuine 
improvements in the value of those services.
■ 
Maintain a service knowledge management system (SMKS). This objective is impor-
tant for the success of knowledge management, because the delivery mechanisms 
you use for transferring knowledge will make information easily accessible. It will be 
important to ensure that the information shared is appropriately presented and 
controlled for the correct audience.
■ 
Gather, store, analyze, share, use, and maintain knowledge, information, and data 
throughout the service provider organization. Without this objective, the process will 
not function at all; having a repeatable mechanism for capturing data so that you can 
carry out analysis, which allows you to provide the knowledge to support your 
services, is vital to knowledge management success.
The Scope of Knowledge Management
The scope of knowledge management crosses the whole of the service lifecycle. The detailed 
description of the process is located in the service transition lifecycle stage, so we will cover 
knowledge management from the perspective of transition. But knowledge management 
is essential throughout all stages of the lifecycle, and the ability to communicate, share, 
and deliver knowledge, information, and experience is important for service management 
success.
There is signiﬁ cant importance placed on the management of data and information 
across the service management processes. Each process will have an element of knowledge 
management or shared data. In the operational processes, you create records and data that 
need to be connected and managed. You should consider the relationship between knowl-
edge management and service asset and conﬁ guration management. SACM manages the 
connection and relationship between individual CIs and service assets, some of which may 
be information sources or outputs. Knowledge management manages the achievement 
of the knowledge and its sharing and analysis. So, there is a very clear relationship between 
the two processes (the relationship between the conﬁ guration management system and the 
service knowledge management system was shown in Figure 9.3).
The management of knowledge is also vital for using the service management processes 
with your customers and users. So, the scope of the process extends into the relationship 
you have with your businesses, and you need to ensure that you share appropriate informa-
tion with your customers and users, in an accessible format.
Using the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom 
Structure
The application of knowledge management is usually displayed as the Data-Information-
Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) structure, as shown in Figure 9.4.

Knowledge Management 
199
Data is the starting point for your generation of knowledge. Data is a set of discrete 
facts, for example, a capture of the volume of service desk calls recorded in the call-logging 
system (such as 100 service desk calls). Organizations usually have the capability to store 
signiﬁ cant amounts of data from a variety of systems when managing services. The ability 
to capture accurate data, which can then be analyzed and transformed into information, is 
key to the success of the process. Effort needs to be made to maintain the integrity of the 
data, including managing the volume of data captured and using the resources for storage 
and update.
You need to be careful that the reports you provide to your customers and users are 
more than just “data dumps” that have minimal value. You need to provide greater context 
and understanding to make your communication more meaningful.
You derive information from data by adding context. For example, the volume of service 
desk calls includes some for hardware faults and some for software (for example, of 
100 service desk calls, 50 were related to router failures, and 50 were related to application 
errors). You begin to be speciﬁ c and perform basic analysis, which allows for greater 
understanding of what the data is telling you.
It is important to ensure that your data can be captured, analyzed, and reused 
efﬁ ciently. Many reports produced by IT departments simply detail information, but this 
may not provide sufﬁ cient context or understanding for the audience. It is the next step in

this structure that provides the additional context and understanding to add value to your 
communications.
Knowledge is formed when you apply experience, context, and understanding to the 
information analysis. This can be gained from your own perspectives or from those of 
others. Knowledge is based on current and past experience and is an accumulation of the 
analysis, experience, and context that you can apply. You are answering the question 
“How does this affect us?”
In the example given previously with 100 service desk calls, of which 50 are router 
failures, you now apply experience, further information, context, and understanding to 
identify how this affects you. Perhaps you have only 50 routers, in which case this is a 
serious and signiﬁ cant failure of equipment. Are they all the same model or all from the 
same vendor? The answers to such questions provide the context you can then apply to 
the information to ensure you can take the next step and make an informed decision. It 
may also be that this example is based in a large organization where 50 router failures are 
insigniﬁ cant for the management of the infrastructure. The context of the information is 
key to understanding how the original data impacts your ability to manage service.
Taking the ﬁ nal step, you are now in a position to make an informed decision. This is 
where the knowledge provided can be applied to your environment to make improvements 
or react to the knowledge to deliver effective service.
To use the previous example of 100 service desk calls, 50 of which are router failures in 
an infrastructure that has only 50 routers, the decision you make may be to replace all the 
routers, change the vendor, or even invoke your service continuity plans.
So, the whole structure of DIKW is designed to ensure that you deliver useful, meaning-
ful knowledge to enable informed decision making by the recipients.
Consider how this works for reports produced from your IT department. How often do 
you deliver information vs. knowledge, ensuring that sufﬁ cient context and understanding 
are part of the delivery?
Using the Service Knowledge Management System
The service knowledge management system is a focused system that allows you to 
manage the data and information that is generated by the service management processes and 
the service measures. The system is designed to ensure that you gain sufﬁ cient knowledge 
from the data sources through a series of processing layers. This enables connection of the 
various data sources, integration of the information, and a processing layer to allow you 
to query, report, and analyze. The ﬁ nal layer is the presentation layer, ensuring that 
your knowledge is presented in an acceptable format to allow decisions to be made.
This structure includes integrating your existing data capture in the CMDBs and CMS 
that are part of the SKMS. It also includes sources such as the service portfolio, deﬁ nitive 
media library, information in SLAs, OLAs and contracts, budgets, cost models, and service 
improvement plans. Finally, it integrates the various information systems from availability, 
capacity, and supplier management.
Figure 9.5 shows a simple diagram of this structure.

Release and Deployment Management 
201
Other information sources will come from the integration of operation data from inci-
dent and problem management. This will include known error information and knowledge 
bases in use in operations.
Some of the information managed through the SKMS will include service reports and 
documentation supporting your services. These may be CIs, and the records about them 
will be managed through the CMS, whereas the actual information will be managed 
through the SKMS. Both of these will be under the control of change management to 
ensure that no unauthorized alterations are made and the integrity and accuracy of your 
information sources are maintained.
Release and Deployment Management
The role of release and deployment management in this lifecycle stage is to ensure the suc-
cessful introduction of changes into the live environment, minimizing the unpredicted 
impact to the business.
To deliver releases into the live environment successfully, you need to have control over 
the release management activities, and in this process we cover the purpose, objectives, and 
scope of the process, as well as the concepts of the release policy and the four phases of 
release and deployment.

Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
The Purpose of the Release and 
Deployment Management Process
Release and deployment management is an important part of managing your live environ-
ment. The process ensures that the build, test, and deployment of the release is delivered 
with minimal adverse impact to the business.
One of the key purposes of the process is to ensure that this activity is planned, 
scheduled, and controlled in accordance with the needs of the organization.
This is one of the most visible processes of transition, because it is where the interac-
tion of the IT department and the business community meets to engage with the new or 
changed services. During release and deployment, you will carry out pilots and testing of 
new services in order to understand whether the service design can be realized effectively in 
operation.
Release and deployment management needs to deliver the new functionality required 
by the business, and it is important to ensure that the new or changed services do not 
negatively impact the existing services.
The Objectives of the Release and Deployment 
Management Process
The objectives of release and deployment management are to do the following:
■ 
Deﬁ ne and agree on deployment plans with the stakeholders of the release. This is an 
important aspect of the process, because the agreement of a schedule and management 
of the activity with the customers and stakeholders who will receive the release 
is important in setting expectations for the desired outcome.
■ 
Create and test release packages. Release packages may consist of a number of 
related conﬁ guration items, and it is the responsibility of release and deployment to 
verify the components are compatible and can be released together.
■ 
Maintain the integrity of a software release package throughout the release. All release 
packages should be stored as part of a deﬁ nitive media library, and the records should 
be kept in the conﬁ guration management system relating to the release. This includes 
managing the constituent components of the release package and keeping accurate 
records about each CI. Hardware releases will be managed in the same way but with-
out the requirement to check them into the DML.
■ 
Follow the agreed release plans according to the schedule, including deploying the 
software release from the DML. Keeping to the plans and schedule will ensure that the 
engagement agreed with the stakeholders can take place efﬁ ciently, in the timeframes 
allocated.
■ 
Manage the release package effectively, ensuring it can be tracked, installed, tested, 
and veriﬁ ed. This includes the potential for uninstalling or backing out the release. 
Delivering the release in a controlled manner is crucial to its success.

Release and Deployment Management 
203
■ 
Ensure that the new or changed service meets the utility and warranty requirements. It 
is important to ensure that the supporting systems and technology for the release are 
contributing appropriately to achieve the requirements.
■ 
Manage and record any unplanned outcomes, risks, and issues from the release. 
Capture of any deviations from the expected performance is an important part of the 
lessons learned for the release, and suitable changes should be made to ensure the ﬁ nal 
outcome meets the requirements speciﬁ ed in the original plans.
■ 
Ensure there is suitable knowledge transfer to the stakeholders of the release to enable 
proper use of the new or changed service. This should be completed according to the 
plans and schedule, including the timely delivery of any training requirements for 
the recipients of the release, both users and the IT operations staff.
■ 
Ensure that sufﬁ cient training is provided for the support teams in operations to enable 
full capability for maintenance and support according to the utility and warranty 
requirements. This element of a release may be easy to overlook, particularly because 
some of the operations teams may be engaged in the deployment of the release, but it is 
crucial to the success of the deployment that operations are able to support the release 
effectively and efﬁ ciently from the start.
The Scope of the Release and Deployment 
Management Process
The scope of release and deployment management covers the processes, systems, and func-
tions required to deliver a release into the live environment. This includes the packaging, 
build, test, and deployment of the release, enabling the release to be executed according 
to the design package, and the speciﬁ ed utility and warranty requirements. The scope 
includes the handover to the service operation teams.
All aspects and CIs associated with the release should be managed, including, for exam-
ple, physical and virtual assets such as servers and networks, applications and software, 
training for IT staff and users, and services including the supporting agreements and 
contracts with suppliers.
There are exclusions to the scope of release and deployment, because some aspects are 
managed as part of other processes. For example, although ensuring that testing takes 
place is part of the responsibility of release and deployment, the activity of testing and 
managing the test environment and plans will be carried out by the process of service vali-
dation and testing.
Release and deployment is not responsible for authorizing activity toward the release 
deployment. This will be referred to the change management process and the change 
authority. Interacting with project management and project authorization may also take 
place, but any IT change activity should be coordinated through change management.

204 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
Creating the Release Policy
To ensure effective management of releases, there should be a deﬁ ned release policy for 
each service or group of services. The policy is important for the overall control of release 
and deployment within service management. Specifying the requirements that should be 
managed for any release for the service or services, this document should be under change 
control and managed as a service asset. Not all changes will require release and deployment 
management for their implementation; for example, minor operational changes will be 
managed through change management and operational activity. Release and deployment is 
used for signiﬁ cant or complex changes, and the policy should set out the requirements that 
need to be considered for successful implementation.
As part of the policy, there should be a deﬁ nition of the types of release, which will be 
under the control of release and deployment management. This should be included to set 
expectations for customers and stakeholders regarding the nature of the release and how 
it will be managed. A suggestion for release types is a major release; these are releases that 
will have a signiﬁ cant impact on the business environment, because of either complexity or 
size, and will often include new functionality. Other suggested types are the minor release, 
providing minimal impact or only minor upgrades or enhancements, and the emergency 
release, carried out in response to a business-critical requirement or for a small enhance-
ment. The release policy will deﬁ ne when an emergency release may be carried out and in 
what circumstances.
The policy should cover some or all of the following elements:
■ 
A unique identiﬁ cation structure or naming convention to ensure releases can be easily 
identiﬁ ed and tracked. This should include a description for the associated release.
■ 
Deﬁ nitions of the roles and responsibilities required for the management of the release 
throughout all its stages.
■ 
Use of the deﬁ nitive media library for all software asset releases.
■ 
The expected frequency for speciﬁ c types of release.
■ 
The approach for grouping changes into a release and how any additional updates are 
to be included if enhancements are required.
■ 
Any automation that can be applied to the build, installation, and deployment to 
deliver a repeatable mechanism to improve efﬁ ciency.
■ 
How the conﬁ guration baseline will be taken prior to the release and what means will 
be used to verify its accuracy in terms of components before agreement and recording.
■ 
The entry and exit criteria for each stage of the release, including the authority 
required, as well as deﬁ nitions of the acceptance criteria for entry into controlled test 
and development environments and other supported environments such as disaster 
recovery or training.
■ 
The criteria for the ﬁ nal handover into operations, including the criteria for the 
completion and exit of the early life support stage.

Release and Deployment Management 
205
Managing the Four Phases of Release and Deployment
There are four phases to release and deployment:
Release and Deployment Planning This phase starts with the authorization from change 
management to plan a release and ends with change authorization to create the release. 
It is here that the plans for creating and deploying the release are produced. This is an 
important aspect of the process, because a properly planned release will improve the 
efﬁ ciency of the deployment.
Release Build and Test During this phase, the release package is built, tested, and checked 
into the DML if it is software and documentation only or contains these elements. The 
trigger for this phase is the authorization from change management for the release build to 
take place and ends with the authorization to include the baselined package in the DML. 
This phase will take place only once during any release. Service asset and conﬁ guration 
management has control over the DML, so the processes of change, SACM, and release and 
deployment will work closely together.
Deployment This phase starts with change management authorization for deploying 
the release package from the DML and/or hardware store if applicable. The package 
is deployed to the live environment, and this phase ends with handover to the service 
operation teams and/or early life support. Depending on the selected deployment mecha-
nisms, there may be a number of stages in the deployment activity. In early life support, 
the development and deployment teams are still working alongside the operational teams 
as the release goes live. This provides support for the release in the initial stages, when the 
majority of the issues will be identiﬁ ed. This step in release and deployment management is 
crucial for the support of the release as it goes live and provides speedy resolution of issues 
and faults. This will improve customer and user satisfaction with the new service and will 
also assist in the transfer of knowledge to the support teams and the users.
Review and Close This is where experience and feedback are captured, performance 
targets are reviewed, achievements are assessed, and lessons are learned. Improvements 
identiﬁ ed, either to the process or to the release, should be formally captured, and actions 
should be taken to address any issues.
In Figure 9.6, you can see the various points where the change process provides 
authorization and triggers for the phases of the release. This would be managed as part 
of the original change record and would not require separate requests for change. Some 
organizations may take a different view, particularly in the case of major releases, and 
require  further documented authorization through raising individual requests for change. 
But either approach is acceptable, because it is important to ensure that your change and 
release and deployment processes are ﬂ exible enough to meet your organization’s 
requirements. The important factor is that authorization is provided through change 
 management to trigger each phase of the release.

■ 
Knowledge management
■ 
Service asset and conﬁ guration management
■ 
Change management
It is important to remember that all the activities and processes in service transition are 
working toward delivering a new or changed service into the operational environment in a 
controlled manner, with minimal disruption and adverse impact to the business.
Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the transition planning and support 
process. This process ensures that all transitions are managed efﬁ ciently.
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the service asset and configuration 
management process. This process ensures that you capture accurate and reliable 
information about the assets that make up your services. It applies to all service assets and 
conﬁ guration items.
Recall that configuration items are identified and recorded as part of the configuration 
management system, and identify the purpose of the system. The conﬁ guration manage-
ment system is used to integrate information about the infrastructure and provide a 
comprehensive view of the CIs and relationships that make up your services.
Understand the configuration model, a configuration baseline, and a snapshot. The con-
ﬁ guration model provides a model of the services, assets, and infrastructure by capturing 
the details of each conﬁ guration item and their relationships to each other. A conﬁ guration 
baseline is a capture of the state of the infrastructure at a speciﬁ c point that is reviewed and 
agreed upon and used for trending, comparison, and planning. A snapshot is a capture of 
the infrastructure at a point in time but may contain errors and inaccuracies because it is 
not reviewed and agreed upon.
Understand the nature and purpose of the definitive media library. The deﬁ nitive media 
library is a speciﬁ c secure area set aside for managing software media. It may consist of 
physical and electronic stores for master copies of licensed or authorized software in use in 
the live environment, as well as the associated documentation.
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of knowledge management. This process 
ensures knowledge is available in the right place at the right time to enable informed 
decisions, reducing the need for knowledge rediscovery.
Be able to recall the DIKW model. Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom is a model 
used to transition from data to information to knowledge to wisdom, ensuring that you add 
context and understanding to the communications you provide to the organization 
you support.

208 
Chapter 9 ■ Service Transition Processes
Understand the use of the service knowledge management system. The service knowledge 
management system is the overarching system for managing knowledge relating to 
service management. It integrates all the existing data sources from your service manage-
ment processes and enables the DIKW structure for knowledge management across the 
whole service lifecycle.
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the release and deployment management 
process and the release policy. This process ensures that releases are planned, scheduled, 
and controlled so the new or change services are built, tested, and deployed successfully 
into the operational environment. The release policy describes the manner in which releases 
will be carried out, provides deﬁ nitions for release types, and speciﬁ es the activities that 
should be managed under the control of the process.
Know the four phases of the release and deployment management process. The four 
phases are release and deployment planning, release build and test, deployment, and 
review and close. All four should be triggered by authorization from the change 
management process.

This chapter covers the how the IT service provider organizes 
to deliver the services to the required standard. The service 
operation stage is when the service is actually being delivered, 
and often is a much longer stage than the previous stages of strategy, design and transition. 
We will cover the purpose, objectives, and scope for each process, along with the value it 
provides to the business. We will discuss the generic concepts and deﬁ nitions involved 
in this lifecycle stage and consider the importance of good communication in achieving 
successful service operations. Finally, we shall look at the service operation functions 
identiﬁ ed in ITIL. These are the service desk, technical management, application 
management and operations management functions. 
Understanding the Purpose, Objectives, 
and Scope of Service Operation
The output from service strategy, design, and transition becomes visible in service operation. 
It is in the operational stage that the service, which was originally considered in strategy, put 
together in design, and rolled out in transition, actually delivers the beneﬁ t that the business 
requires. It is also a much longer stage of the lifecycle than the ﬁ rst three stages; the service 
should continue to meet the business requirement for months or even years.
The majority of IT staff is involved (to a greater or lesser extent) in the service operation 
stage. They may contribute to other lifecycle stages; their main focus is the delivery of the oper-
ational services. In this chapter, we examine the four functions involved in the service lifecycle.
The Purpose of Service Operation
The purpose of the service operation stage of the service lifecycle is to deliver the service 
at the level that was agreed through the service level management process. This includes 
all the activities required to deliver the service as well as managing the technology used to 
deliver the service (such as applying updates, backing up data, and so on).
Service operation must deliver the service effectively but also has to ensure that the cost 
of that delivery is within the operational costs that formed part of the original business 
case. Should a service be operated at a higher cost than was originally envisaged, the 
beneﬁ ts that were planned, such as cost savings, may never be realized.
Many of the processes that we have discussed when examining the other lifecycle stages 
take place during the service operation stage. Service level management, for example, 
is a process that is undertaken as part of service design; once operational, however, the 

Understanding the Purpose, Objectives, and Scope of Service Operation 
213
monitoring and reporting of the service performance takes place during the operation 
phase. The same is true of capacity and availability management; ongoing monitoring and 
adjustments of these aspects take place during service operation. It is essential, therefore, 
that all of the processes that are operated during the operation phase work effectively and 
 efﬁ ciently. Continual service improvement (CSI) also depends on service operation 
producing the required information to allow improvement opportunities to be identiﬁ ed, 
baselines to be taken, and the success of any improvements measured.
Service operation staff members must view the service as a whole and be given the tools 
they need to evaluate whether the delivery meets the standard required. It is a common 
error to have staff members concentrate on individual aspects of a service or to ignore those 
parts of the service provided by third parties, losing sight of the end-to-end service as it 
appears to the customer. Technology can be used to spot deviations from expected service 
or response levels very quickly, allowing remedial action to be put in place immediately.
The Objectives of Service Operation
It is the job of the service operation phase to deliver the service as agreed on in the SLA; this 
ensures that the business receives the level of service it expects. Some service outages are 
inevitable; service operation will work to reduce both the number and impact of outages. 
The service operation process of problem management aims to reduce repeat incidents that 
disrupt business activities, while incident management aims to resolve those incidents 
that do occur as quickly as possible.
Service operation is also responsible for controlling access to IT services. The access man-
agement process ensures that only authorized users can have access to the services provided.
The Scope of Service Operation
The scope of service operation described in the ITIL framework includes the “processes, 
functions, organization, and tools” that are used to deliver and support the agreed services. 
This lifecycle stage is responsible for performing the critical day-to-day activities and 
processes that ensure the service meets the business requirement and enables the business to 
achieve its objectives. It also collects the performance data that will be required by continual 
service improvement to identify and track improvement opportunities. The ITIL Service 
Operation publication provides guidance on the successful management of the following:
The Services Themselves This includes all the activities required to deliver the services 
consistently within the agreed service levels. These activities may be carried out by the 
service provider, an external supplier, or the user or customer of that service.
The Service Management Processes These include the service operation processes of event, 
incident, problem and access management, and request fulﬁ llment. (We will be looking at 
the service operation processes in Chapters 11 and 12.) In addition to these processes, 
service operation has responsibility for carrying out activities associated with processes that 
originated in other lifecycle stages. Figure 10.1 shows these processes. Capacity management, 
for example, is a design process; however, the day-to-day monitoring and tuning of 
capacity takes place in service operation.)

214 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
The Technology Delivering IT services depends on the use of appropriate technology 
(network, desktops, servers, databases, data, monitoring tools, and so on). Service 
operation is responsible for managing the technology that delivers the services.
The People Despite automation, service operation depends on the actions of the support 
staff members to ensure the service runs as it should. Their management of the technology 
and processes is the key to successful service delivery. In this chapter, we will be examining 
the people who deliver the service.
The Value Service Operation Delivers to the Business
The ITIL framework offers guidance on the best practices that can be used in the various 
lifecycle stages, and following this advice can deliver real beneﬁ ts. In the area of service 
operation, the beneﬁ ts to be achieved from following best practices include the following:
■ 
Financial savings from reduced downtime as a result of the implementation of the ser-
vice operation processes of problem and incident management. Problem management 
will reduce the frequency of failures so that less time (and therefore money) is wasted 
by the business not being able to work. It will ensure that skilled IT staff members 
 concentrate their efforts on identifying and removing the root cause of the incident, 
thus preventing recurrence. Meanwhile, efﬁ cient incident management ensures that the 
service is restored as soon as possible, often by service desk staff members using deﬁ ned

workarounds. This both speeds up the service restoration and reduces costs, because the 
more expensive IT staff members are not called on to resolve simple  incidents.
■ 
Service operation includes the production of management information regarding the 
efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the service delivery. This is used by other processes to 
target, justify, and implement continual service improvement initiatives.
■ 
By carrying out the access management activities, service operation ensures that services are 
protected from unauthorized access, in accordance with the organization’s security policy.
■ 
The request management process enables the business to obtain standard services 
quickly and with minimum bureaucracy.
■ 
By using technology to automate routine tasks, based on the information provided by 
the event management process, service operation reduces the number of staff members 
required to operate the service. This means as the number of users grows and the 
complexity of the services increases, the number of people needed to support the users 
remains broadly the same. This reduces costs and frees up technical staff members 
to concentrate on identifying improvements and new opportunities. Automation also 
delivers a more reliable and consistent service.
Organizing for Service Operations
ITIL describes four main functions that are responsible for carrying out all the lifecycle 
processes. These are the technical management, application management, operations man-
agement functions, and the service desk. The IT operations management function is further 
divided into IT operations control and facilities management. We will cover each of these in 
turn and then look at where the responsibilities of each function overlap. It is important to 
remember that ITIL is not prescriptive and does not specify an organizational structure or 
names of teams. The responsibilities of the functions described here should be carried out, 
but each organization will have its own structure.
Technical Management
Whatever the name given to the team or teams in any particular organization (infrastructure 
support, technical support, network management, and so on), the function referred to in 
the ITIL framework as technical management is required to manage and develop the IT 
infrastructure. This function covers the groups or teams that together have the technical 
expertise and knowledge to ensure that the infrastructure works effectively in support of 
the services required by the business.
Role
The technical management function has a number of responsibilities:
■ 
It is responsible for managing the IT infrastructure. This would include ensuring that 
the staff members performing this function have the necessary technical knowledge to 
design, test, manage, and improve IT services.

216 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
■ 
Although we discuss this function under service operation, the function provides 
appropriately skilled staff members to support the entire lifecycle. Technical 
management staff members would be involved in drawing up the technical strategy and 
ensuring that the infrastructure can support the overall service strategy. Technical 
management staff members would also carry out the technical design of new or 
changed services and would be involved in planning and implementing their transition 
to the operational environment.
■ 
Once the service is live, technical management provides technical support, resolving 
incidents, investigating problems, responding to alerts, and specifying any changes or 
updates required to have the service operate efﬁ ciently. Technical management staff 
members will identify service improvements and work with the CSI manager to design, 
test, and implement these improvements.
It is the responsibility of the manager or managers of this function to ensure the correct 
number of staff members, with the correct skills to carry out the required tasks. Specifying 
the numbers and skill levels required is discussed as part of strategy and detailed as part 
of service design (as discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Transition tests that the staff 
members are able to support the service as designed, and CSI identiﬁ es any improvements 
or training requirements. The technical manager must decide whether to employ new staff 
members with the correct skills, to train existing staff members, or to use short-term 
contract resources to meet a particular requirement. Larger organizations may have a team 
of subject-matter experts that can be called upon when required by subsidiary departments, 
without the need for those skills to be developed across the organization.
Most of the everyday operational support activities will be undertaken by the operations 
support staff members, but it is the responsibility of technical management, as the experts 
in the technology, to guide and support the operations staff members.
Objectives
The objectives of technical management include the following:
■ 
Providing the appropriate technical infrastructure to support the business processes. 
This should take account of the availability and capacity requirements, providing a 
stable resilient infrastructure at an affordable cost.
■ 
Planning and designing the technical aspects of any new or changed service.
■ 
Implementing these technical aspects and supporting them in the live environment, 
using the technical expertise that the function possesses to ensure that any issues that 
arise are swiftly resolved.
Applications Management
The second service operation function described in the ITIL framework is that of application 
management. This function shares many features with the technical management function, 
although in this case it is the application software that is supported and managed throughout 

Organizing for Service Operations 
217
its lifecycle, rather than the infrastructure. Application management and applications devel-
opment are not the same, and it is important to understand the differences between them:
■ 
Application management is involved in every stage of the service lifecycle, from 
ascertaining the requirements through design and transition and then operation and 
improvement.
■ 
Application development is mostly involved in single, ﬁ nite activities, such as designing 
and building a new service. We discuss this in more detail later in this chapter.
As with technical management, the application management function may not be called 
this in many organizations. Whichever group of staff members is responsible for managing 
and supporting operational software applications is the application management function. 
As with technical management, this function may be split across a number of teams.
Application management may carry out some tasks as part of application development 
projects, such as design or testing. This is not the same as the work of application develop-
ment itself.
Role
The application management function is involved in all applications. Even when the 
function has recommended purchase of the application from an external supplier, there is 
still a requirement for management activities to take place. These activities are very similar 
to those of the technical management function:
■ 
It is responsible for managing the IT applications. This would include ensuring that 
the staff members performing this function have the necessary technical knowledge to 
design, test, manage, and improve IT services.
■ 
It is the custodian of technical knowledge and expertise related to managing applications.

Although we discuss this function under service operation, the function provides appro-
priately skilled staff members to support the entire lifecycle. Application management 
staff members would be involved in drawing up the application strategy. They would 
carry out the design of new or changed applications and would be involved in planning 
and implementing their transition to the operational environment. Once the service is 
live, application management provides support, resolving incidents, investigating prob-
lems, and specifying changes or updates required to have the service operate efﬁ ciently. 
Application management staff members will identify service improvements and work 
with the CSI manager to design, test, and implement them.
Application management stafﬁ ng and training responsibilities are the same as those 
identiﬁ ed for technical management, and the function similarly interacts with the other 
stages of the lifecycle.
Application management also performs other speciﬁ c roles:
■ 
Application support ensures that the operations management staff members are given 
the correct training to enable the applications to be run efﬁ ciently.
■ 
As part of service design, application management may carry out a training needs 
analysis covering the service operation staff members and provide the required training, but 
this role is a continuous one, providing day-to-day support to the operations staff members.

Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
Objectives
The objectives of application management are to do the following:
■ 
Identify functional and manageability requirements for application software
■ 
Help in the design of applications
■ 
Assist in their deployment
■ 
Support the applications in the live environment
■ 
Identify and implement improvements
To be successful, application management must ensure that applications are well-
designed, taking account of both the utility and warranty aspects of service design. They 
must be able to deliver the right functionality at a reasonable cost, if the business beneﬁ t is 
to be realized. The provision of the correct numbers of appropriately skilled staff members 
is essential so that these skills may be applied to resolve any application failures.
Application Development vs. Application Management
As discussed earlier, application management and application development have separate 
aims and responsibilities. These two groups may work closely together or may be quite 
 separate, with different reporting structures and a different interface with the business. 
Application development, as we said earlier, is normally a ﬁ nite activity to develop an appli-
cation, moving on to the next requirement when ﬁ nished. Application management, on the 
other hand, remains involved throughout the lifecycle of the application.
■ 
Development focuses on the utility aspects, and most of its work is carried out on 
applications developed in-house. Management activities consider both warranty and 
utility and are carried out whether the application is internally developed or purchased.
■ 
Development is concerned with functionality and does not consider how it is to be 
operated or managed, whereas application management is concerned with how this 
functionality is to be delivered consistently.
■ 
Development is often carried out as part of a project, with deﬁ ned deliverables, costs, and 
handoff dates. This differs from application management, whose activities are ongoing 
throughout the service lifecycle and whose costs may not be separately identiﬁ ed.
■ 
Developers may not have an understanding of what is required to manage and operate 
an application because they do not support the applications they have developed, 
instead moving on to the next development project. Similarly, application management 
staff members may have little involvement in development, meaning that they have a 
reduced understanding of how applications are developed.
■ 
Development staff members work to software development lifecycles. Application 
management staff members are often involved only in the operation and improvement 
stages of the service lifecycle.
Figure 10.2 shows the differing roles of the application management and application 
development teams; the application development team is primarily concerned with the 
functionality of the application, whereas the application management team considers 
how the application infrastructure will support the application and how it will be built, 
deployed, and monitored in operation.

F I G U R E 10 . 2 Role of teams in the application management lifecycle
There is a growing tendency to end the division between the two teams, because it 
is confusing for the business to understand. Ideally, this will mean a broadening of the 
 development role to include considering how applications will operate, and it will mean 
more involvement in development for staff members who will be managing the application.
Operations Management
The role of operations management is to carry out all the day-to-day activities that are 
required to deliver the services provided. The applications and technical management func-
tions are the subject-matter experts in their respective ﬁ elds and deﬁ ne what operational 
activities are to take place; operations management’s role is to make sure these are done.
The service design stage deﬁ ned the required service levels, and the transition phase 
 carried out tests to ensure that these were achievable; operations management is responsible 
for ensuring that these service levels are met consistently. Although the primary focus is 
on stability and availability, operations management will seek to continually improve by 
implementing changes that will help protect the live service or by reducing costs and oppor-
tunities for human error by implementing automation of routine tasks.
The quality of the service delivered to the business is dependent on operations manage-
ment. This role is divided into two parts, covered next.

220 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
IT Operations Control
This part of operations management oversees the IT infrastructure. In larger organizations, 
this may be carried out as part of an operations bridge or Network Operations Center 
(NOC). In these organizations, there are dedicated staff members monitoring operational 
events on consoles and reacting to them as necessary, often in a separate area from the rest 
of IT. In smaller organizations, the line between technical management and operations 
control may be more blurred, with operations control being carried out by the technical 
management team, monitoring the systems from their desks, perhaps with one or two wall-
mounted plasma screens. Whichever arrangement is chosen depends upon what suits the 
organization, but it is important that there are clearly deﬁ ned expectations to ensure that 
the operations control tasks are carried out to the level required.
The operations control tasks include the following:
■ 
The centralized monitoring and management of system events, as discussed, sometimes 
referred to as console management.
■ 
The scheduling and management of batch jobs to carry out routine tasks, such as data-
base updates.
■ 
Carrying out backups of data and ensuring that this data can be restored if and when 
required. This may include the backup of entire systems or the restoration of individual 
ﬁ les that a user may have corrupted.
■ 
Although most printing is now carried out directly by the users, there may be certain 
requirements for centralized printing; pay slips will need to be printed in a secure envi-
ronment to ensure conﬁ dentiality, and large print volumes may make centralized 
printing more efﬁ cient. The printing and distribution of these or other electronic 
output is an operations control task.
■ 
Operations control will also undertake maintenance activities, under the guidance of 
the technical or application management functions; this could include archiving data, 
applying system packs, updating virus signatures, and so on.
Facilities Management
The other part of operations management is facilities management. Staff members 
involved in this will be responsible for the physical IT environment. This would include the 
following:
■ 
Ensuring the necessary power is supplied (including any requirements for its quality, 
such as the prevention of any power spikes).
■ 
Operating and maintaining any uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and generators. 
Facilities management is responsible for ensuring that these are available and for 
 testing to ensure that they will work as designed, in the event of a power failure. This 
role may cover just a server room in a smaller organization or one or more data centers 
for larger ones.
■ 
Ensuring the power provided at any disaster recovery sites has the required protection 
from failure and ensuring the maintenance of satisfactory air conditioning/cooling 

Organizing for Service Operations 
221
for rooms housing IT equipment, whether this is a server room or a complete data 
center.
Many organizations have undertaken data center or server consolidation projects in 
recent years to take advantage of technical advances. The facilities management 
function would be responsible for managing any such projects. In the case where the data 
center management is carried out by a third party, it would be the responsibility of facilities 
management to ensure that the external service provider was carrying out the required 
tasks to the agreed standard and managing any exceptions utilizing the supplier 
management process.
To be effective, operations management needs to understand the technology and how 
it supports the services provided, although this level of knowledge will be less than 
that provided by the technical and application management functions. There is a risk that 
operations staff members do not interact with the business as part of their work and 
so may fail to appreciate the business impact of failures or to understand the business 
importance of services, thinking of them in purely technical terms. It is essential that they 
have adequate understanding of the business aspect; the information showing how technol-
ogy supports the business is available in the CMS, but speciﬁ c training may be required 
to ensure that they have the necessary appreciation of the impact technology has on the 
business.
The importance of stability of services has been already mentioned; one way of main-
taining that stability is to ensure that routine tasks are carried out consistently, no matter 
which staff members are on shift. This requires that properly documented procedures and 
technical manuals are available to operations staff members.
The performance of the operations management function should be measured against 
clear objectives, based on the performance of the service, not merely of the technology. 
Delivering the service to the required level, within the agreed cost, is essential, so opera-
tions management should be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of what they do but 
also prove that they are operating at maximum efﬁ ciency. Operations management should 
always strive to optimize the use of existing technology and exploit new technical advances 
to provide the required level of service at the best cost.
Objectives
The objectives of IT operations management include continuing to provide stable services 
to enable the business to obtain the business beneﬁ ts from the service, while also investigat-
ing possible improvements to enable the service to be provided more cost-effectively.
Service operation’s other objective is to overcome any failures that do occur as quickly as 
possible in order to minimize the impact to the business.
Overlapping Responsibilities Between Functions
The responsibilities for managing many aspects of the operational environment are often 
shared, with the technical management and application management teams providing spe-
cialist support for each area, while operations management carries out the monitoring and 

222 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
maintenance activities and dealing with the simpler faults. Figure 10.3 shows this overlap; 
under the headings of technical management and application management there are exam-
ples of areas of responsibility such as networks and specialist applications, with the ﬁ gure 
showing how the responsibility for these is shared with service operations. The ﬁ gure also 
shows those activities that are entirely service operations’ responsibility, such as backups. 
The service desk is shown for completeness, but its responsibilities and those of the other 
functions do not overlap.

223
The Service Desk Function
The ﬁ nal service operation function described by the ITIL framework is that of the service 
desk. A service desk is a functional unit consisting of a dedicated number of staff members 
responsible for dealing with a variety of service activities, usually made via telephone calls, 
web interface, or automatically reported infrastructure events. We will cover this function 
in more detail, because it plays a critical role in customer satisfaction. Although the service 
desk staff members do not have the same level of in-depth technical knowledge as the staff 
members in the other functions, their role is just as important.
The service desk function is the most visible of the four functions; every hour of every 
day they come into contact with business users at all levels. A poor service desk can result 
in a poor overall impression of the IT department, while an efﬁ cient, customer-focused 
team can ensure customer satisfaction even when the service is operating below the agreed 
service level.
An essential feature of a service desk is that it provides a single point of contact (SPOC) 
for users needing assistance. It provides a single day-to-day interface with IT, whatever the 
user requirement. It provides a variety of services:
■ 
Handles incidents, resolving as many as possible, where the resolution is straightfor-
ward and within the service desk authority level
■ 
Owns incidents that are escalated to other support groups for resolution
■ 
Reports problems to the problem management staff members
■ 
Handles service requests (including ensuring that requests for software to be installed 
have the required license)
■ 
Provides information to users
■ 
Communicates with the business about major incidents, upcoming changes, and so on
■ 
Manages requests for change on the user’s behalf if required
■ 
Manages the performance of third-party maintenance providers, ensuring that they 
provide the agreed service
■ 
Monitors incidents and service requests against the targets in the SLA and provides 
reporting from the service desk tool to show the level of service achieved
■ 
Updates the CMS as required
■ 
Gathers availability ﬁ gures, based on incident data
Staffing
The service desk will use a service management tool and other technical resources to enable 
it to carry out its tasks and will follow deﬁ ned processes (especially incident management 
and request fulﬁ llment). Although these tools and processes are  important, the people aspect 
of the service desk is critical. The interactions with the customers and users require good 
communication skills, in addition to technical knowledge.  Knowing the answer is only part 
of the job; explaining it in terms that users understand is essential.

224 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
Recruiting and retaining good service desk staff members is the key to customer satis-
faction. This function often acts as an entry level to the other functions, providing staff 
members with an understanding of all the services, the technology that supports them, 
and the business impact of failure. This provides an excellent basis for future technical 
specialization.
Service desk staff members require a mix of technical knowledge and interpersonal 
skills. The technical knowledge may not be in depth, but it covers all the services provided 
by the IT service provider. The service desk analyst can be said to know a little about a lot 
of services, rather than a lot about a few.
The ability to correctly prioritize incidents based on business impact and urgency (see 
the discussion of incident management in Chapter 11) requires that the service desk analyst 
has a good level of awareness about the business processes. Added to this knowledge is 
the requirement to be patient, helpful, assertive when dealing with support teams or third 
 parties who are failing to meet targets, well-organized, and calm under pressure.
Service desks are organized differently dependent upon the particular requirements of the 
organization. We cover various service desk structures later in the chapter. The skill level 
required may also vary; the service desk may be tasked with resolving a high proportion 
(75 percent to 80 percent) of incidents, or it may be limited to logging and escalating 
them for resolution by another team. Service desks are often outsourced to specialist 
providers; the decision whether to do this will be based on the overall IT strategy. If the 
decision is made to outsource, the third-party supplier’s performance must be monitored 
and managed closely to ensure that this essential service is being provided to the highest 
standard.
Role
The provision of a single point of contact is accepted in many industries as being central to 
good customer service. Without a service desk, users would have to try to identify which IT 
support team they should approach. This could be confusing for the business, leading to a 
delay in having their issue resolved. Technical staff members would waste time dealing with 
issues outside their specialist area or issues that could be dealt with by more junior staff 
members.
Providing a good service desk leads to a number of beneﬁ ts:
■ 
Increased focus of customer service
■ 
Increased customer satisfaction
■ 
Easier provision of support through the single point of contact
■ 
Faster resolution of incidents and fulﬁ llment of requests at the service desk, without 
the need for further escalation
■ 
Reduced business impact of failures because of faster resolution
■ 
More effective use of specialist IT staff members

Organizing for Service Operations 
225
■ 
Accurate data regarding the numbers and nature of incidents, taken from the service 
desk tool
Objective
As we have said already, the main objective of the service desk is to provide a single point 
of contact. The next most important objective is to restore service in the event of a failure. 
This may not mean a complete resolution of the incident, but the provision of a work-
around, to enable the user to continue working. Fulﬁ lling a request, resetting a password, or 
answering a “How do I … ?” query all help the user get back to work as soon as possible.
Other responsibilities of the service desk include the following:
■ 
Logging all incidents and requests, with the appropriate level of detail
■ 
Categorizing incidents and requests for future analysis
■ 
Agreeing on the correct priority with the user based on impact and urgency (utilizing 
SLAs wherever possible for consistency)
■ 
Investigating, diagnosing, and resolving incidents whenever possible
■ 
Deciding upon the correct support team to whom to escalate the incident should the 
service desk be unable to resolve it
■ 
Communicating progress to the users
■ 
Conﬁ rming closure of resolved incidents with the user
■ 
Carrying out surveys to ascertain the level of customer satisfaction
We will cover some of these activities in more depth when we look at the incident and 
request processes.
Service Desk Organizational Structures
The best structure for the service desk is dependent upon the size and structure of the orga-
nization. A global organization will have different needs from one with all its employees 
based in the same location. Here we look at the most common structures; the best option 
may be a combination of them.
Local Service Desk
This option provides a service desk co-located with the users it serves; an organization with 
three ofﬁ ces would have three local service desks. There are advantages with this approach, 
in that the service desk is local, so it understands the local business priorities. Where the 
ofﬁ ces are spread across different countries, local service desks provide support in the lan-
guage of the local users, work in the same time zone, have the same public holidays, and 
so on. This structure can also be useful when different locations have specialized support 
needs. The basic principle of a single point of contact is retained, because, from the user 
perspective, they have only one number to call and are unaware of any other desks that 
may exist.

226 
Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
This is an expensive option, because each new ofﬁ ce location would require a new 
 service desk too. At quiet times, there would be several service desk staff members spread 
across the various desks waiting for calls. There are potential issues with incidents and 
requests being logged in different languages, possibly in different systems; this makes 
 incident analysis and problem identiﬁ cation difﬁ cult. Sharing knowledge is also more 
 difﬁ cult: an incident that could be resolved by one service desk might be escalated by 
another, because the resolution has not been shared between the desks.
To overcome these issues, IT management must ensure that information is shared effec-
tively. Procedures need to be put in place to ensure that issues affecting more than one 
 location are managed effectively, without duplication of effort, or each service desk assum-
ing that another desk is responsible. Figure 10.4 shows the local structure.

Organizing for Service Operations 
227
Centralized Service Desk
A more common structure for service desks is that of a centralized service desk. In this 
model, all users contact the same service desk. This has the beneﬁ t of providing economies of 
scale, because there is no duplication of provision. Specialist technology, such as intelligent 
call distribution or an integrated service management tool, may be justiﬁ ed for a central-
ized service desk, but not when implementing this technology across many sites. There are 
no issues with confusion regarding ownership of major incidents, and knowledge-sharing 
becomes much more straightforward. Offering a service at times of low demand is more 
cost effective when only one service desk needs to be staffed.
Staff members on a centralized desk will gain more experience of particular incidents, 
which a local service desk may encounter only occasionally, leading to an increased ability 
to resolve these issues immediately. Where the centralized desk is supporting users in many 
countries, the language issue may be resolved by either of the following:
■ 
Employing staff members with language skills and using technology to allocate calls 
requiring support in a particular language to staff members who have that language 
ability. Staff members would then log the call in the main language.
■ 
Standardizing on one language; callers would need to report incidents in that language, 
and support would be provided in it. This option depends on the type of organization and 
whether its users may reasonably be expected to be able to converse in the language. Local 
superusers may be required to support users without the necessary language ability and to 
log calls on their behalf.
To provide support to a global organization, a 24/7 service may be required. Where 
the resolution requires a physical intervention (unjamming a printer, for example), the 
service desk would require local staff members to provide that support, answerable to 
the service desk.
Consideration should also be given to maintaining service continuity, because an event 
that affects a centralized service desk would impact support across the entire organization. 
A plan to provide the service from another location, possibly using different staff mem-
bers, in the event of a disaster must be developed and tested, in conjunction with IT service 
 continuity management. There should also be plans in place to ensure the service desk’s 
resilience in the event of disruption to the network or a power failure.
Figure 10.5 shows the centralized structure.
Virtual Service Desk
The third organizational option described by ITIL is that of a virtual service desk. This 
option consists of two or more service desk locations that operate as one desk. Calls and 
emails are distributed across the staff members as if they were in one centralized location. 
This ensures that the workload is balanced across all the desks. To the user, the virtual 
service desk appears as a single entity; the users may be completely unaware that this is not 
the case in reality. The virtual service desk retains the single point of contact principle.
The considerations we discussed earlier regarding knowledge sharing and clear owner-
ship apply even more in this scenario, as does the need for all calls to be logged immediately.

F I G U R E 10 . 5 Centralized service desk structure
Users will become very frustrated if they call the service desk and explain an issue in detail, 
only to ﬁ nd when they call for a second time that the service desk analyst can ﬁ nd no 
record of their ﬁ rst call.
The ability to route calls to analysts with particular language knowledge or to adopt one 
language for all users can be considered, as with a centralized desk. Calls must be logged 
on one common system, using one language, because the next analyst to handle the inci-
dent may be in another location.
The virtual service desk structure allows for a variety of ways of working. Many call 
centers use home-based staff members, who log on to the service desk telephone system and 
are allocated calls. Extra staff members from other teams can supplement the core service 
desk staff members at busy times, without the users being aware. Many of us have had the 
experience of calling a local company, only to have the call answered offshore outside of 
normal hours or during bust times.
Offshoring support (providing support from another geographical location where staff 
members’ costs may be lower) can be cost-effective but requires careful management to 
ensure consistency of service. Managers need to be culturally sensitive, because users may 
become irritated by staff members behaving in a way in which they ﬁ nd unfamiliar.

Organizing for Service Operations 
229
One beneﬁ t of a virtual structure is that it has built-in resilience; should one location 
go ofﬂ ine because of a major disruption affecting that location, the service would continue 
with little or no impact.
Figure 10.6 shows the virtual service desk structure.
Follow the Sun
The fourth structure described within ITIL is known as follow the sun. This is a form of 
virtual service desk, but with this structure, the allocation of calls across the various desks 
is based on time of day, rather than workload.
“Follow the sun” enables a global organization to provide support around the clock, 
without needing to employ staff members at night to work on the service desk. A number 
of service desks will each work standard ofﬁ ce hours. The calls will be allocated to which-
ever desk or desks are open at that time. Typically, this might mean a European service 
desk will handle calls until the end of the European working day, when calls will then be 
allocated to a desk or desks in North America. When the working day in North America 
ﬁ nishes, calls are directed at another desk or desks in the Asia-Paciﬁ c region, before being 
directed back to the European desk at the start of the next European working day.
This option is an attractive one for many global organizations, providing 24-hour cov-
erage without the need for shift or on-call payments. The requirements for effective call 
logging, a centralized database, and a common language for data entry referred to earlier 
for the virtual structure apply equally here. Procedures for handoff between desks are also 
required to ensure that the desk that is taking over knows the status of any major incidents, 
and so on.
Offshore Support Difﬁ culties
A large insurance company in the United Kingdom decided to offshore its service desk. 
Overseas staff members were recruited carefully, with tests to validate their language 
and technical skills. After some months, an analysis of telephone trafﬁ c showed that 
many customers were hanging up as soon as they realized that their call was being 
answered offshore. Focus groups of users were interviewed to try to understand why 
this was happening.
The answer was not the level of technical support but a combination of the lack of 
local knowledge and cultural issues. The offshore staff members had been coached 
in customer service and were putting the recommendations into effect, explaining to 
the user what they were doing, thanking the user after every piece of information was 
 provided, and so on. The users were not used to this level of service and expressed a 
wish that “the service desk staff members just got on with the task and stopped talking 
about it!”

To the user, the single point of contact still applies; they have one number to call, no 
matter who answers it or where the service desk analyst may be located.
Specialized Service Desk Groups
Another possible variant on the previous structures is to provide specialist support for 
particular services. In this structure, a user may call the usual service desk number and 
then choose an option depending on the issue they have. Typically, the message would say, 
“Press 1 if the call is regarding system X, press 2 if it is regarding system Y, or hold for a 
service desk analyst if your call is in regard to anything else.”
Although this approach can be useful, especially where in-depth knowledge is required 
to resolve a call, it is not popular with users when it expands to numerous options to choose 
from, followed by another message saying “Thank you. You now have a further n options.”
There is a danger that the user does not always know what support they need and may 
choose the wrong option, leading to delay and frustration. For example, a printer that will 
not print may be because of a hardware fault, a network issue, an application malfunction, 
or a user error. The user will not know which option to choose.

Exam Essentials 
231
This specialist support option works best for a small number of complex services that 
require a level of both business and technical knowledge beyond what can reasonably be 
expected of a service desk analyst. Another possible reason to use this option is when the 
service contains conﬁ dential data. In this situation, the organization may wish to limit 
access to a small number of specialist support staff.
Summary
This chapter covered the purpose, objectives, and scope of service operation and covered 
how people are grouped into functions to deliver the service. The importance of the service 
operation stage was covered; it is in this stage that the services deliver business value and 
the return on the investment of the earlier lifecycle stages is realized (or not!).
We covered which processes from other lifecycle stages require service operation action. 
We looked at the overlapping responsibilities of the operations management function with 
the technical management and application management functions. We covered the role and 
importance of the service desk in providing a single point of contact for IT for the business, 
together with the various service desk structures that may be suitable for different situa-
tions. We also considered the skills and attributes required for service desk staff members.
In the following chapters, we will be covering the major service operation processes of 
incident and problem management in some depth, and looking in less detail at the other 
processes of this lifecycle stage: access management, request management, and event 
management.
Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose of the service operation: to deliver the services that have been 
designed and transitioned as efficiently as possible. During this stage, faults that were not 
detected during transition will be identiﬁ ed and resolved, and the delivery of the service 
will be optimized.
Service operations is required to deliver the services in line with the SLAs that have been 
agreed with the business. The transition stage should have validated the SLA targets 
through testing and piloting the service; it is for service operations to continue to meet the 
SLA targets during the operational stage of the service lifecycle.
By delivering the services efficiently and within service targets, service operations ensure 
that the business benefits from the service as planned. Be able to name and describe the 
four service operation  functions: technical management, application management, IT 
operations management, and the service desk.

Chapter 10 ■ Delivering the Service: The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
Understand the role of the technical and application management functions in providing 
resources to the other lifecycle stages and in specifying the operational tasks that service 
operation staff members should carry out. Understand the overlap between these 
functions and operations management.
Explain the difference between application development and application support. Under-
stand the two areas of operations management: operations control and facilities 
management. Be able to think of examples of the responsibilities of each of these areas, 
such as monitoring environmental conditions (IT facilities management) and console 
management (operations control).
Know the role and importance of the service desk function. Be able to list the skills and 
attributes that service desk staff members should possess, such as business awareness, 
 technical awareness, customer focus, and so on. Be able to describe the different service 
desk structures of local, central, virtual, and follow the sun, as well as when each might be 
used. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

Incidents and Problems: Two Key 
Service Management Concepts
The two processes of incident and problem management are among the most important of 
all the ITIL processes. They are often the ﬁ rst to be implemented by an organization that 
has decided to adopt the ITIL framework. The differentiation between incident manage-
ment and problem management is an important distinction, and an organization that has 
adopted both of these processes has made a major advance toward improving their services 
and their service management.
Both these processes are carried out by every IT service provider, whether they are called 
by these names or not. All service providers ﬁ x faults as quickly as possible when they 
occur (incident management) and try to ascertain why the fault occurred so that it can 
be prevented from happening again (problem management). Many organizations do not 
differentiate between the two processes, however, and problem management in particular 
may not be carried out in a consistent fashion. A failure to appreciate the difference 
between problems and incidents may result in delayed service restoration following an 
incident and in allowing incidents to recur, causing business disruption each time.
ITIL provides guidance for the best approach to these two key processes. Effective 
incident management will improve availability, ensuring that users are able to get back to 
work quickly following a failure. Problem management will improve the overall quality and 
availability of services (and as such works in conjunction with continual service improve-
ment); it also makes best use of skilled IT staff, who are freed from resolving repeat 
incidents and are able to spend time preventing them instead.
Incident Management
In ITIL terminology, an incident is deﬁ ned as an unplanned interruption to an IT service, 
a reduction in the quality of an IT service, or a failure of a CI that has not yet impacted an 
IT service (for example, failure of one disk from a mirror set).
This is an important deﬁ nition; because the incident is an interruption to service, 
restoring the service or improving the quality of the service to agreed levels resolves the 
incident. Note that incident resolution does not necessarily include understanding why 

Incident Management 
239
the fault occurred or preventing its recurrence; these are matters for problem management. 
By understanding this distinction, you can see that resolving an incident does not need the 
skill that resolving a problem requires. If the service can be restored by a simple reboot, 
then the user can be instructed to do this by the service desk staff, without involving the 
more skilled (and therefore more expensive) second-line technicians.
From the user and business perspectives, the focus is on being able to get back to work, 
and there is little interest in the cause of the failure. Repeat occurrences will impact their 
work and increase the number of calls to the service desk so an investigation of the cause, 
and the permanent resolution of the underlying problem, will be required, but this can take 
place without impacting the users.
The incident management process is responsible for progressing all incidents from when 
they are ﬁ rst reported until they are closed. Some organizations may have dedicated incident 
management staff, but the most common approach is to make the service desk responsible for 
the process.
Sometimes the resolution of an incident is possible only by understand-
ing the cause and fixing the underlying fault. A hardware or network fail-
ure due to a failed hardware component where there is no resilience will 
need to have the component replaced or repaired before service can be 
restored. In the majority of incidents, however, service can be restored to 
the individual user without a permanent problem resolution.
The Purpose of Incident Management
The purpose of incident management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as 
possible and minimize the adverse impact on business operations, thus ensuring that 
agreed levels of service quality are maintained. Normal service operation is deﬁ ned as an 
operational state where services and CIs are performing within their agreed service 
and operational levels.
As explained, by focusing on service restoration, incident management enables the 
business to return to work quickly, thus ensuring that the impact on business processes and 
deadlines is reduced.
The Objectives of Incident Management
The objectives of the incident management process are to ensure that all incidents are efﬁ -
ciently responded to, analyzed, logged, managed, resolved, and reported upon. By carrying 
out these tasks in an efﬁ cient and effective manner and by ensuring that affected customers 
are updated as required, the IT service provider aims to improve customer satisfaction, 
even though a fault has occurred. At all times during the incident management process, the 
needs of the business must be considered; business priorities must inﬂ uence IT priorities.

240 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
The Scope of Incident Management
Incident management encompasses all incidents: all events have a real or potential impact 
on the quality of the service. Incidents will mostly be logged as the result of a user contacting 
the service desk, but event management tools may report an incident following an alert (see 
the discussion of event management in Chapter 12); often there will be a link between the 
event system and incident management tool so that events meeting certain criteria can 
automatically generate an incident log. Third-party suppliers may notify the service desk 
of a failure, or technical staff may notice that an error condition has arisen and log an 
incident.
As discussed in Chapter 12, not all events are incidents; many are informa-
tional or a confirmation that a component is functioning correctly.
Requests may be logged and managed at the service desk, but it is important to differ-
entiate between these requests and incidents; in the case of requests, no service has been 
impacted. Incident and problem management seek to reduce the number of incidents over 
time, whereas the IT service provider may want to handle increasing numbers of requests 
through the service desk and the request fulﬁ llment process as a quick, efﬁ cient, and 
customer-focused method of dealing with them.
Efﬁ cient incident management delivers several beneﬁ ts to the business; it reduces the 
cost of incident resolution by resolving incidents quickly, using less-skilled staff. Where 
incidents need to be escalated, the resolution is faster (because the relevant information 
required will have been gathered and an initial diagnosis will have been made). Faster inci-
dent resolution means a faster return to work for the affected users. Effective incident 
management improves the overall efﬁ ciency of the organization because nonproductive 
users are a cost to the company.
Incident prioritization is based on business priorities, which ensures that resources are 
allocated to maximize the business beneﬁ t. The data gathered by the service desk about 
the numbers and types of incidents can be analyzed to identify training requirements or 
potential areas for improvement.
As highlighted in the discussion of the service desk in Chapter 10, incident management 
is one of the most visible processes, as well as one that all users understand the need for. 
So, it is one of the easier areas to improve, because an improved incident resolution service 
has easily understood beneﬁ ts for the business.
Basic Concepts for Incident Management
ITIL describes a number of basic concepts to keep in mind when implementing the incident 
management process. They are covered in the following sections.

Incident Management 
241
Timescales
Time is of the essence in incident management because every incident represents some loss 
or deterioration of service. Every aspect of the process needs to be optimized to produce the 
fastest end result. Service-level agreements, operational-level agreements, and underpinning 
contracts will deﬁ ne how long a support group or third-party has to complete each step, 
with measurable targets.
Service management tool sets should be conﬁ gured to capture how long it takes to log 
and escalate an incident, how many incidents are resolved within the ﬁ rst few minutes 
without requiring escalation, and how long support teams take to respond to and to ﬁ x 
incidents. These times should be monitored, and steps should be taken to identify 
bottlenecks or underperforming teams so that improvement actions can be taken.
Incident Models
Using incident models, which are incident templates prepopulated with the necessary steps 
to resolve common incidents, is one method of speeding up resolution. They enable faster, 
more consistent logging and resolution. The steps may instruct the service desk how to 
resolve the incident or may predeﬁ ne the information to be gathered as well as the correct 
escalation group.
Major Incidents
All incidents should get resolved as quickly as possible, but some incidents are so serious, 
with such an impact on the business, that they require extra attention. The ﬁ rst step is to 
agree on exactly what is deﬁ ned as a major incident. Some organizations will deﬁ ne all pri-
ority one incidents as major; others may restrict priority one incidents to those whose impact 
will be felt by the external customers. In this deﬁ nition, an incident with a major impact 
within the organization would not normally be classed as major. An incident that (for 
example) prevents customers from ordering goods from the organization’s website and that 
is therefore affecting both revenue and reputation would be included. The deﬁ nition must 
align with the priority scheme to avoid confusion.
The purpose of deﬁ ning an incident as a major incident is so that it can receive special 
focus. Speciﬁ c actions to be undertaken are deﬁ ned in advance so that when the major 
 incident occurs, everyone knows what they are expected to do. Typical actions might 
include the following:
■ 
Notiﬁ cation of key contacts within the service provider organization and the business 
as soon as the major incident is declared
■ 
Regular updates posted through agreed channels—intranet, key users, and so on
■ 
Recorded greeting put on the service desk number to inform callers that the incident 
has occurred and is being dealt with to reduce the number of calls being handled by 
the desk
■ 
Appointment of a major incident manager (this may be the service desk manager) and 
the appointment of a separate team to focus on resolving the incident

242 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
As with any incident, some major incidents can be resolved without understanding 
the cause (perhaps by restarting a server); some require the underlying cause to be under-
stood. In the second case, problem management would become involved. It is essential, 
however, that the focus of incident management remains on restoring service as quickly 
as possible.
As we discussed in Chapter 10, a major responsibility of the service desk is communicat-
ing with the users; this is particularly true in the case of major incidents. Regular updates 
should be provided. The service desk staff members are also accountable for ensuring 
that the incident record is kept up-to-date throughout the incident, although it may be 
the  technicians in other teams who actually enter the information. An accurate record is 
essential during the incident so that there is no confusion; it will also be used after the 
 incident is resolved, as part of the major incident review. Regular updates showing the 
steps taken and whether they were successful will allow improvements to be identiﬁ ed 
for future events.
Incident Status
Incident management tracks incidents through their lifecycle, moving from when the 
incident is identiﬁ ed through diagnosis and resolution and ﬁ nally closure. Incident 
management must ensure that incidents are resolved as quickly as possible and so will 
remind resolving groups of the associated target times, making sure no incident is forgotten 
or ignored.
Most service management tool sets will allow a number of statuses to be deﬁ ned for 
each incident to facilitate progress tracking. Typical statuses include the following:
Open The incident has been identiﬁ ed and logged. It may be being worked on by a  service 
desk analyst, or the service desk may be considering which second-line team it should be 
escalated to. Incidents resolved by the ﬁ rst-line team may move directly from Open to 
Closed, because the service desk analyst obtains the user conﬁ rmation that the incident has 
been satisfactorily resolved.
Assigned This may mean the incident has been sent to a support team but not allocated to 
a particular individual.
Allocated or In Progress This is usually deﬁ ned as when a support technician has been 
allocated the call.
Where the service desk manager is managing the incident, another man-
ager may be appointed to head up the team; they would then report prog-
ress to the incident manager. This is necessary to avoid a situation where 
the two roles, that of managing the situation and keeping stakeholders 
informed and that of pursuing a solution, are in conflict.

Incident Management 
243
On Hold This status is sometimes used when the user is not available or has not the time 
to test the resolution. It is used to “stop the target clock,” because the service provider 
cannot do anything further to resolve the incident without the user.
On Hold status should be used with caution; support staff may be tempted 
to use it when they are too busy to work on the incident or when they are 
awaiting the actions of a third-party supplier. This is not its purpose, and 
using it in this way distorts reporting against OLAs and UCs, because the 
failure to provide the support and meet the target is hidden by the fact the 
clock is stopped.
Resolved This status indicates that the technician has completed their work, but it has not 
been conﬁ rmed by the customer that this was successful. It is common to use the service 
management’s automated email facility to automatically email the user when an incident 
is resolved, asking for a response within x days if the user is still not happy. If no reply is 
received, the incident is automatically closed.
■ 
If the user is unhappy, the call is put back into In Progress, and further work is carried 
out to resolve it.
■ 
The service desk should attempt to contact users to obtain permission to close calls 
before the automated closure, especially for high-impact incidents, where the user may 
not be aware of the resolution.
Closed This status conﬁ rms that the incident is over to the user’s satisfaction. The inci-
dent management process has no further involvement, although problem management may 
now investigate the underlying cause.
Expanded Incident Lifecycle
The expanded incident lifecycle is used by the service design availability management 
 process and within CSI. The expanded lifecycle breaks down each step of the process 
so that they can be examined to understand the reasons for the failed targets. For example, 
the diagnosis of the incident may ascertain very quickly that the resolution requires the 
restoration of data, which takes three hours; this information would be used to pinpoint 
where improvements should be made. Delays in any step of the lifecycle can be analyzed, 
and improvements can be implemented to speed up resolution; implementing a knowledge 
base or storing spare parts on-site are two typical measures that are taken to shorten the 
diagnosis and repair steps.
Managing Incidents
We are going to look at the lifecycle of an incident and each of the process steps that take 
place. Refer to the ﬂ ow chart pictured in Figure 11.1.

Incident Management 
245
All incidents must be logged, no matter how they are identified.
Step 1: Incident Identification
Incident management is a reactive process; we cannot start to resolve an incident until we 
know it has occurred. As we said earlier, it is essential that incidents are resolved in the 
shortest possible time, because each represents business disruption. Whenever possible, 
therefore, we should be trying to realize that an incident has occurred before the user 
notices or, failing that, before they have reported it to the service desk. Chapter 12, on 
event management, shows how monitoring tools can be used to identify failures. The event 
management process should link directly to incident management so that any incidents 
spotted are worked on immediately and resolved quickly.
Where an automated response to an incident is used, such as restarting 
a server following a failure, an incident should still be logged for future 
analysis.
Where event management is not in place, incidents will be identiﬁ ed by users contacting 
the service desk.
Step 2: Incident Logging
The incident record contains all the information concerning a particular incident; details 
of when it was logged, assigned, resolved, and closed may be required for service-level 
management reporting. Details of symptoms and the affected equipment may be used by 
problem management. Steps taken to resolve the incident may be used to populate a 
knowledge base. It is essential therefore that all relevant information is added to the record 
as it progresses through its lifecycle.
A good integrated service management tool makes good recordkeeping much easier, 
because it can automatically populate the record with user details (from Active Directory 
or a similar tool) and equipment and warranty details (based on the CI number). Automatic 
date and time stamping of each update and identiﬁ cation of who made the update will both 
improve the completeness of the information in the record.
Service management tool sets differ, but a typical list of required information in an 
incident record would include the following:
■ 
Unique reference number, generated automatically
■ 
Incident category (covered in the next section)
■ 
Incident impact, urgency, and priority
■ 
Date/time of every update, from logging to closure
■ 
Name of who logged and updated the incident

Step 3: Incident Categorization
Incidents are categorized during the logging stage. This can be helpful in guiding the 
service desk agent to the correct known error entry or the appropriate support team for 
escalation. A simple category structure should be used, however; too complex a scheme 
leads to incidents all being logged as “other” or “miscellaneous” because the agent does not 
want to spend the time considering which category is correct. This makes later analysis very 
difﬁ cult. A multilevel scheme, as shown in Figure 11.2, achieves granularity without fac-
ing the service desk agent with a long list to choose from. Incidents should be  recategorized 
during investigation and on resolution, if the original choice was incorrect. (The service 
desk agent will have chosen the most appropriate category based on the information 
available at the time, but further investigation may have shown that, for example, a printer 
fault was actually a cabling fault.)

Incident Management 
247
Step 4: Incident Prioritization
Incidents need to be prioritized to ensure that the most critical incidents are dealt with ﬁ rst. 
It is often said that all users believe that their own incident is the highest priority, so it is 
important to agree during service-level negotiations what criteria should be used to decide 
priority.
The ITIL framework recommends that two factors should be considered: business 
impact and urgency (how quickly the business needs a resolution). Business impact can be 
assessed by considering a number of factors: the number of people affected, the criticality 
of the service, the ﬁ nancial loss being incurred, damage to reputation, and so on. Dependent 
on the type of organization, other factors such as health and safety (for a hospital or a 
railway company or similar) and potential breach of regulations (ﬁ nancial institutions, and 
so on) may be considered.
During the life of an incident, it may be necessary to adjust the priority of an incident if 
the assessment of the impact changes or a resolution becomes more urgent.
The Numbers Game
A global engineering company outsourced its hardware maintenance. The contract 
stated that prioritization, and therefore target resolution times, would be based on the 
number of CIs affected. One day a printer failed and was duly reported. It was allocated 
the lowest priority, with a target of ﬁ ve days because it was a single printer. What was not 
appreciated, however, was that this was not an ofﬁ ce laser printer but a factory printer 
that printed barcodes to show which spare parts were packed in each box. With no way 
of indicating what was in the boxes, they could not be packed, so after 24 hours the 
production line was closed down, and all the staff members working on it were all sent 
home! It took another 24 hours before senior management realized what was happening 
and the ﬁ nancial loss that was being incurred.
In this situation, the outsourcer had followed the contract, but those involved in negotiat-
ing it had neglected to consider prioritization criteria beyond a very simplistic approach.
Deciding the priority must be simple, because the incident has to be logged quickly. 
Employing service desk staff with good business knowledge and ensuring they are trained 
to be aware of business impact will help a realistic assessment of business impact to be 
made. Table 11.1 shows a simple but very effective way to determine priority.
Table 11.2 shows how the determination of priority made using the matrix in Table 11.1 
can in turn be employed to set a target resolution time for the incident.

Assigning the Correct Priority
Sometimes a user insists on a high priority, even if the impact and urgency do not justify 
it; this puts the service desk agent in a difﬁ cult position. The incident should be logged 
at the higher priority to avoid arguing with the customer, who may already be agitated. 
The incident can be reviewed later, perhaps during a service review, and the point can 
tactfully be made that escalating an incident to a higher priority than justiﬁ ed could mean 
another incident, with a genuinely high priority, may not be actioned.
One tactic used by some organizations is to agree, within the SLA, that all high-priority 
incidents require a form to be completed by the user justifying the high priority for analy-
sis during the major incident review. A signiﬁ cant number of users, when told of this 
requirement, decide that perhaps a lower priority is satisfactory after all!
Many organizations struggle with applying the prioritization rules when the user 
reporting the fault is very senior. Some organizations will have a formal procedure in 
place to give these VIPs faster service; some will apply the business impact and urgency 

Incident Management 
249
 evaluation to their incident as with any other caller (although the business impact is likely 
to be higher with these users). There needs to be clear guidance to the service desk agent 
whether to (for example) prioritize a VIP’s printer fault over a fault affecting online sales.
Some organizations address this issue by formally recognizing the needs of VIPs for fast 
service and deﬁ ning a special service level (gold service) for them within the SLA, docu-
mented in the service catalog.
Step 5: Initial Diagnosis
The initial diagnosis step refers to the actions taken at the service desk to diagnose the fault 
and, where possible, to resolve it at this stage. The service desk agent will use the known 
error database provided by problem management, incident models (covered earlier), any 
other diagnostic tools to assist in the diagnosis, and possible resolution. Where the service 
desk is unable to resolve the incident, the initial diagnosis will identify the appropriate 
support team for escalation.
One technique used by the service desk agent is “incident matching.” By checking for 
previous incidents with the same classiﬁ cation, the service desk agent may be able to 
identify a repeat incident and the appropriate resolution steps. This speeds up the resolution 
and increases the ﬁ rst-contact ﬁ x rate.

Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
As we have stated previously, time is of the essence in incident management, so the 
length of time an agent has to resolve the incident will be limited. If the incident can be 
resolved at ﬁ rst line, it is far more efﬁ cient for the user and the IT provider that this is done; 
holding onto the call for too long, however, delays the eventual resolution. Consideration 
needs to be given to what the time limit should be; ﬁ ve to ten minutes is common.
Part of this stage is the gathering of information to assist the second-line technician in 
resolving the incident quickly. Again, sufﬁ cient time is required for this step; “saving” time 
by passing the incident to a second-line technician quickly but with sparse details is not 
helpful. The second-line technician will need to contact the customer to obtain the 
information, adding delay and frustration. Support teams should provide guidance to 
the service desk about the type and level of information they should be gathering.
Step 6: Incident Escalation
The ITIL framework describes two forms of escalation that may take place during incident 
management: functional escalation and hierarchic escalation. We will look at each of these 
in turn.
Functional escalation takes place when the service desk is unable to resolve the incident; 
this may be realized immediately because of the type of incident such as a server failure or 
because the service desk agent may have spent the maximum time allowed under the 
organization’s guidelines attempting to resolve the incident without success. It then needs 
to be passed to another group with a greater level of knowledge. The second-line support 
group that receives this escalated incident will also have a time limit for resolution, after 
which the incident gets escalated again to the next support level. Sometimes, as with the 
service desk, it is obvious that the incident will require a high level of technical knowledge, 
and in such a case the incident would be immediately escalated, without any attempt by 
second-line support staff to resolve it.
The service desk must know the correct group to escalate an incident to, to avoid 
unnecessary delays, so the service desk staff needs to have sufﬁ cient technical knowledge 
to be able to identify which incident goes to which team. Operational-level agreements 
will  specify the responsibilities of each group. There may be occasions where cooperation 
between support groups is required or where the incident needs to be referred to third 
 parties such as hardware maintenance companies. The OLAs and UCs should specify what 
should happen in this situation.
Incident ownership remains with the service desk. Incidents may be 
escalated to support groups or third parties, but the service desk retains 
ownership of the incident, tracking progress, keeping users informed, and 
obtaining the user’s agreement to its eventual closure.
The second type of escalation is hierarchic escalation, which takes place for high-priority 
or major incidents. This escalation consists of informing the appropriate level of management 
about the incident so that they are aware of it. This ensures that the management is able to 

Incident Management 
251
make any decisions that are required regarding prioritization of work, involving  suppliers, 
and so on. In the case of a major incident, the IT director may be expected to brief the 
business directors about the progress of the incident; even if this is not the case, business 
managers may go directly to senior IT managers when a serious incident has occurred, so it 
is essential that the IT managers have been thoroughly briefed themselves.
It is also sometimes necessary to use hierarchic escalation when the incident is not 
progressing as quickly as it should or if there is disagreement among the support groups 
regarding to whom it should be assigned.
A good service management tool will be able to automatically escalate incidents, based 
on the SLA targets, updating the record with details. For example, a tool could be set to 
notify a team leader when 90 percent of the SLA target time had passed and to inform the 
team leader’s line manager when the incident breached the target.
Step 7: Investigation and Diagnosis
The major activity that takes place for every incident is investigation and diagnosis. The 
incident will have undergone the initial diagnosis step covered earlier; this identiﬁ es 
whether the service desk can resolve the incident because the incident has been seen before. 
The investigation and diagnosis stage here is different; it involves trying to ascertain what 
has happened and how the incident can be resolved.
The incident record should be updated to record what actions have been taken, and an 
accurate description of the symptoms, and the various actions taken, is required to prevent 
duplication of effort; it will also be useful when the incident is reviewed, perhaps as part of 
problem management. Typical investigation and diagnosis actions would include 
gathering a full description of the issue and its impact and urgency, creating a timeline of 
events, identifying possible causes such as recent changes, interrogating knowledge sources 
such as the known error database, and so on.
Step 8: Resolution and Recovery
Potential incident resolutions should be tested to ensure that they actually resolve the 
issue completely with no unintended consequences. This testing may involve the user. 
Other resolution actions might include the service desk agent or technician remotely 
taking over the user’s equipment to implement a resolution or to show the user what they 
need to do in the future. Once the incident is resolved, it returns to the service desk for 
closure.
Step 9: Incident Closure
When the incident has been resolved and the service restored, the service desk will contact 
the user to verify that the incident may be closed (covered earlier). This is an important 
step, because the fault may appear resolved to the IT department, but the user may still be 
having difﬁ culties, especially if there were actually two incidents, with the symptoms of 
one being hidden by the other. The second incident would become apparent only after the 
ﬁ rst was resolved. The service desk may contact the user directly, or an email could be sent 
with a time limit when the incident will be closed, as described earlier.

252 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
The category assigned to the incident when it was logged should be reviewed. The 
initial incident categorization is based on the available evidence at the time; following the 
resolution, it may be altered to reﬂ ect the conﬁ rmed cause (covered earlier). If the underlying 
cause of the incident is still unknown, despite the fact it has been resolved, a problem 
record may be raised to investigate the underlying cause and to prevent a recurrence. 
Finally, a user satisfaction survey may be carried out.
Interfaces Between Incident Management 
and the Lifecycle Stages
Incident management is a key process that is carried out by all service providers. There are 
several links between the process and other processes both within service operation and 
within the service design stage.
Service Design
Several of the service design processes interface directly with the incident management 
process. These processes are among those we discussed in Chapter 10, where many of 
the process activities take place in the service operation lifecycle stage. Service-level 
 management interfaces with incident management because SLAs will contain incident 
 targets; the other service design processes may result in incidents if the processes fail to 
 prevent a security breach, a lack of capacity, or unplanned downtime.
Service level management As we have seen, there are numerous links between incident 
and service-level management. Incidents have target response and resolution times; these 
targets are set in the SLAs. Incident management in return provides the management 
information from the service management tool set to enable SLM to report on the success 
achieved in meeting these targets. Incident reporting enables SLM to identify failing ser-
vices and to implement service improvement plans for them (in conjunction with continual 
service improvement).
Information security management, capacity management, and availability 
 management Incident management collects data on the number of security-related 
incidents and capacity issues. It provides the data on downtime that availability uses to 
calculate availability reports, and analysis of incident records helps availability management 
understand the weak points in the infrastructure that need attention. An efﬁ cient incident 
lifecycle also improves overall availability.
Service Transition
The service transition processes of SACM and change management interface with incident 
management; SACM provides useful information to the incident process, and changes may 
be the cause of incidents or the means by which incidents are resolved.
Service asset and configuration management Incident management uses SACM data to 
understand the impact of an incident, because it shows the dependencies on each CI. It 

Problem Management 
253
provides useful information regarding who supports particular categories of CI. By logging 
each incident against a CI and checking that the user of the CI is as recorded in the CMS, 
incident management helps keep the CMS accurate.
Change management Changes are often implemented to overcome incidents. Incidents 
may often be caused by changes. An important input into incident investigation is the 
change schedule; asking the question “What changed just before this incident occurred?” 
can often highlight the cause of incidents. In the case of a major incident caused by 
a change, the decision may be made to back out the change. Information identifying how 
many incidents were caused by changes should be fed back to change management to 
improve future changes.
Service Operation
There is a strong interface between incident management and problem management, as 
we will be covering in the rest of this chapter. Access management issues may also cause 
incidents.
Problem management As you will learn when we discuss problem management in the rest 
of this chapter, incident management and problem management have many links. Incident 
management provides the data on repeat incidents that problem management uses to identify 
underlying problems. The permanent resolution of these problems helps incident 
management by reducing the number of incidents that occur. The incident impact and 
urgency information helps problem management prioritize between problems.
Problem management provides known error information, which enables incident 
management to restore service.
Access management Incident management raises incidents following security breaches 
or unauthorized access attempts. This information can be used by access management to 
investigate access breaches. Failure to ensure users are granted the necessary access they 
require to do their job may result in incidents being reported when the user is greeted 
with an error message when attempting to carry out a task.
Problem Management
According to ITIL ofﬁ cial terminology, a problem is deﬁ ned as an underlying cause of 
one or more incidents. Problem management is the process that investigates 
the cause of incidents and, wherever possible, implements a permanent solution to pre-
vent recurrence. Until such time as a permanent resolution is applied, it will also attempt 
to provide a workaround to enable the service to be restored and the incident to be 
resolved.
It is important to understand the differences between incidents and problems and to 
realize that an incident never becomes a problem.

254 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
Many organizations make the mistake of thinking that problem management is not 
 essential. Typically they will state something like “this year we will concentrate on incident 
management; maybe next year we shall try some problem management.” This is unwise. 
Until and unless problem management is undertaken, incidents will recur, inconveniencing 
the business and occupying support staff time. Problem management will reduce incidents, 
freeing up more time to undertake more problem management. It is a virtuous circle; the 
more time spent on it, the more time is freed up by it.
The Purpose, Objectives, and Scope of Problem 
Management
The purpose of the problem management process is to document, investigate, and remove 
causes of incidents. It also provides another very useful beneﬁ t; by providing workarounds, it 
reduces the impact of incidents that occur. It proactively identiﬁ es errors in the infrastructure 
that could cause incidents and provides a permanent resolution, thus preventing the incidents.
Problem management aims to identify the root cause of incidents, to document known 
errors, and to take action to remedy them. Problem management has three simple objectives:
■ 
Prevent problems and resulting incidents from happening
■ 
Eliminate recurring incidents
■ 
Minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented
The scope of problem management includes diagnosis of the root cause of incidents 
and taking the necessary action in conjunction with other processes (such as change 
management and release and deployment management) to permanently remove them.
A Mechanical Incident, Problem, and Workaround
One morning, as you leave your house to go to work, you ﬁ nd that your car will not start. 
You have an incident.
You have little mechanical knowledge, but you do know how to apply a workaround—to 
use jumper cables. You do this, the car starts, and your incident is over.
Every morning for a week, the same thing happens, and each time you apply the work-
around to overcome the incident and restore service. The underlying problem could have 
several possible causes: a faulty battery, a mechanical fault preventing the engine from 
charging the battery, a light in the trunk left permanently on, and so on. The problem 
investigation has to be carried out by someone with a greater mechanical knowledge 
than you.
On the weekend, you take the car to a mechanic, who diagnoses the root cause and 
applies a permanent resolution (replaces the battery, ﬁ xes the wiring, or whatever is 
required). Your car will now start each morning!

Problem Management 
255
Problem management is also responsible for compiling information about problems and 
any associated workarounds or resolutions. By identifying faults, providing workarounds, 
and then permanently removing them, problem management reduces the number and the 
impact of incidents. It has a strong relationship with knowledge management, because it 
is responsible for maintaining a known error database and could also be said to be part of 
continual service improvement.
There are important similarities and differences between the two principal service 
operation processes. The same service management tool will usually be used to track both 
incidents and problems, and a good tool will facilitate the linking of incident occurrences 
to speciﬁ c problem records. Similar categories and prioritization classiﬁ cations may be 
used. However, problem management may be a process of which the business is unaware. 
Once a workaround has been applied and an incident resolved, the user may think no 
more about it. Meanwhile, the IT service provider uses problem management to prevent 
 recurrence. An effective workaround can take some of the pressure off support staff, 
allowing them to take the time to investigate the underlying cause, without being chased 
for a resolution, as the service has been restored.
As we have said, an incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction 
in the quality of an IT service. Sometimes an incident cannot be resolved until the cause 
is known and remedied; a server fails and will not restart, for example, because of a 
hardware fault.
Unlike incident management, which is entirely reactive (you cannot resolve an incident 
until it has occurred), problem management has both reactive and proactive features.
■ 
Problem management will react to incidents and attempt to identify a workaround and 
a permanent resolution.
■ 
It will also proactively try to identify potential incidents and take action to prevent 
them from ever happening. This might include analysis of incident trends, such as 
intermittent but increasingly frequent complaints about poor response times, to 
identify a potential capacity issue. By working with capacity management, proactive 
 measures can be taken to provide sufﬁ cient capacity and avoid any major breaks in 
service. Event management reports may also be analyzed to the same end, in this case, 
preventing an incident before the user is aware of any issue.
■ 
Problem management may assist in a major incident review, trying to identify how to 
prevent a recurrence.
Reactive and proactive problem management activities normally take place as part of 
service operation, but problem management is also closely related to continual service 
improvement. Where improvement opportunities are identiﬁ ed as a result of problem 
management, they should be entered into the CSI register.
Problem Management Concepts
As stated earlier, problem management is not an interesting optional activity; it is 
fundamental to providing a consistent service, in line with SLA commitments. By providing 
workarounds to enable resolution of incidents with the ﬁ rst-line staff, better use is made of 

256 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
the more skilled and therefore more expensive second- and third-line staff, who are freed 
up to use their skills in problem investigation.
Reactive and Proactive Activities
The process steps for managing problems that are raised in reaction to incidents and those 
that are proactively identiﬁ ed are broadly similar. The main difference is the trigger for the 
process. Reactive activities take place as a result of an incident report and help prevent 
the incident from recurring or provide a workaround if avoidance is impossible; these 
activities complement the incident management process.
Proactive problem management analyzes incident records to identify underlying causes 
of incidents. It may be that analysis of previous incidents reveals a trend or pattern that 
was not apparent when each incident occurred. For example, users may complain of poor 
response periodically; it is only when all these complaints are analyzed that it becomes 
apparent that the poor response is always reported against the same module or from the 
same location. This would trigger a problem record to be raised to identify the common 
cause linking all these incidents. We will look at this in a bit more detail in the following 
sections.
Proactive problem management process depends on the reporting capability of the 
 service management tool; it must be able to produce reports that show the trend and allow 
drilling down into the data to ﬁ nd the connections that explain it. This may require 
incident reports sorted by category, date, time, location, application, or associated 
 conﬁ guration item. Proactive steps are triggered by attempts to identify improvements 
and as such complement CSI.
Problem Models
It may be useful to use problem models to handle problems that have not and will not be 
resolved, perhaps because the cost or risk is too great or because the technology is due for 
replacement. These problem models are similar to the incident models described  earlier, 
identifying the steps to take. They are used in addition to entries in the known error 
database.
When Is a Problem Raised?
Sometimes it is helpful to raise a problem record while the incident is still open. Each 
 organization will decide its own criteria for when a problem should be raised. For example, 
a problem may be raised when the support teams are sure that the incident has been caused 
by a new problem, because the incident appears to be part of a trend or because there is 
no match with existing known errors. The incident may have been resolved by the service 
desk or support teams without knowing the cause and so there is a risk that the fault may 
recur. This is particularly true in the case of a major incident; the underlying cause needs to 
be identiﬁ ed as soon as possible to prevent future disruption to the business. (The problem 
diagnosis activity may take place in parallel with the incident resolution and may con-
tinue after the successful resolution, until the underlying cause is identiﬁ ed and removed.) 
It is also possible that suppliers may inform their customers of problems that they have 
identiﬁ ed.

Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
Step 1: Detecting Problems
The ﬁ rst step in the process is to identify that a problem exists. As we discussed previously, 
problems may be raised either reactively in reaction to incidents or proactively. In 
addition to the triggers identiﬁ ed earlier, a problem may also be identiﬁ ed as a result of 
alerts received as part of event management. The event monitoring tools may identify a fault 
before it becomes apparent to users and may automatically raise an incident in response.
Step 2: Logging Problems
Having identiﬁ ed that a problem exists, a problem record should be logged. The problem 
record must contain all the relevant information, time-stamped to provide a complete 
picture. Wherever possible, the service management tool should be used to link problem 
records with the associated incident records. Incident details need to be copied into the 
problem record. Some tool sets enable the creation of a problem record from an incident, 
with automatic linking between the two. This can be very useful and saves a lot of time 
cutting and pasting details from one record to another. Be careful, however. Remember 
that the incident has not “become” a problem; the incident must continue to be managed to 
resolution whether the problem is resolved or not.
Typical details entered in a problem record and copied from the incident would include 
details of who reported it and when, details of the service and equipment used, and a 
description of the incident and actions taken. The incident record number and the priority 
and category would also be required.
Step 3: Categorizing Problems
Problems should be categorized in the same way as incidents, and using the same categori-
zation scheme will make linking incidents and related problems together much easier.
An essential prerequisite for identifying trends in incidents is the accurate and consistent 
categorization of incidents. If every service desk analyst logs the same fault differently, it 
will be impossible to discern a trend. The example of poor response could be logged as a 
user complaint, a network issue, an application issue, or even “miscellaneous” or “other.” 
The problem manager should emphasize the importance of accurate categorization to the 
service desk. The use of incident models can be very helpful here because they standardize 
the way common incidents are recorded. Enforcing categorization on incident resolution, as 
mentioned earlier, will also help ensure incident categories are accurate.
Step 4: Prioritizing Problems
As with incidents, the priority of a problem should be based on the impact to the business 
of the incidents that it is causing and the urgency with which it needs to be resolved. The 
problem manager should also consider how frequently the incidents are occurring. It is 
possible that a “frozen screen” that can be resolved with a reboot is not a high-priority 
incident; if it is occurring 100 times a day, the combined impact to the business may be 
severe, so the problem needs to be allocated a high priority. The impact to the business 
must always be considered, so factors such as the cost of resolving the incident, and the 
time this is likely to take, will be relevant when assessing priority.

Problem Management 
259
Step 5: Investigating and Diagnosing Problems
The next stage in the process is to investigate and diagnose the problem. There may not 
be the resources to investigate every problem, so the priority level assigned to each will gov-
ern which ones get the necessary attention. It is important to allocate resources to problem 
investigation, because until the problem is resolved, the incident will recur, and resources 
will be spent on incident resolution.
The ITIL framework suggests a number of different problem-solving techniques, 
which are helpful in approaching the diagnosis logically. The CMS can be very helpful 
in providing CI information to help identify the underlying cause. It will also help in 
identifying the point of failure, where several incidents are reported; the CMS may identify 
that all the affected CIs are linked to the same CI. The KEDB may also provide information 
about  previous, similar problems and their causes. Where a test environment exists, this 
can be used to re-create the fault and to try possible solutions.
Step 6: Identifying a Workaround
Although the aim of problem management is to ﬁ nd and remove the underlying cause of 
incidents, this may take some time; meanwhile, the incident or incidents continue, and 
the service is affected. When a user suffers an incident, the ﬁ rst priority is to restore the 
 service so that they can continue working. A priority of the process, therefore, is to provide 
a workaround to be used until the problem is resolved. The workaround does not ﬁ x the 
underlying problem, but it allows the user to continue working by providing an alternative 
means of achieving the same result. The workaround can be provided to the service desk 
to enable them to resolve the incidents, while work on a permanent solution continues. 
The problem record remains open, because the fault still exists and is continuing to cause 
incidents. The details of the workaround are documented within the problem record, and a 
reassessment of its priority may be carried out.
It is possible that IT or business management may decide to continue to use the work-
around and suspend work on a permanent solution if one is not justiﬁ ed. A problem 
affecting a service that is due to be replaced, for example, may not be worth the effort and 
risk involved in implementing a permanent solution. In the previous example regarding the car 
that fails to start, the owner may decide not to repair the fault if the car is to be replaced 
within weeks. Until it is replaced, the owner uses the workaround of jumper cables, rather 
than pay the mechanic to ﬁ x the fault.
Step 7: Raising a Known Error Record
When problem management has identiﬁ ed and documented the root cause and work-
around, this information is made available to support staff as a known error. Information 
about all known errors, including which problem record it relates to, is kept in the known 
error database (KEDB). When repeat incidents occur, the support staff can refer to the 
KEDB for the workaround.
There may be times when a workaround is available although the root cause is not yet 
known (for example, a reboot restores the service, although we do not know what causes 
the error). On other occasions, we may know the cause but not have a workaround because 
a change has to be implemented to ﬁ x the fault.

260 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
Sometimes a known error is raised before a workaround is available and sometimes even 
before the root cause has been fully identiﬁ ed. This may be just for information purposes; 
a workaround may be available that has not been fully proven. Rather than have a rigid 
rule about when a known error should be raised, a more pragmatic approach is advisable; a 
known error should be raised as soon as it becomes useful to do so.
Problem Resolution
When problem management has identiﬁ ed a solution to the problem, it should be imple-
mented to resolve the underlying fault and thus prevent any further incidents from disrupting 
the service. Implementing the resolution may involve a degree of risk, however, so the change 
management process will ensure the risk and impact assessment of the RFC is satisfactory 
before allowing the change. Ultimately, the decision whether to go ahead with the resolution 
despite the risk is a business decision; the business damage being done by the problem may 
mean the business is prepared to accept the risk in order to have the ﬁ x implemented. For 
more discussion about the acceptance of risk by the business, see Chapter 8.
■ 
Often a change to resolve a problem will be an emergency change because of the 
impact of the problem on the business and the urgency with which it needs to be ﬁ xed.
■ 
In the circumstance mentioned earlier, where a permanent resolution is not justiﬁ ed, 
the KEDB should be used to document the workaround. The entry should state that the 
problem is not to be resolved to prevent any unnecessary work being done on it.
■ 
There may be workarounds that mitigate rather than remove the impact of the fault; 
these should be documented and used until a better resolution is found. Having a 
workaround like this available, although not entirely satisfactory, may allow the 
priority to be reassessed.
Problem Closure
When a permanent solution to the problem has been identiﬁ ed, tested, and implemented 
through the change management process, the problem record can be updated and closed. 
Any open incidents caused by the problem can be closed too. The KEDB should be updated 
to show that the problem is resolved, so any future incidents will not have been caused 
by it; however, the information contained within the problem record may prove useful in 
addressing a future, similar problem.
Major Problem Review
Each organization should deﬁ ne what constitutes a major problem; this may be all 
priority one problems, anything above a particular priority level that continues or some 
other criteria. Once a major problem has been resolved, a review should be held to identify 
any lessons that can be learned from what occurred. This review should happen close enough 
to the time of the event that those involved can still remember what happened. The impor-
tance of good recordkeeping is apparent at a review; a well-documented problem, with a 
full history of steps taken, will provide useful information. A  problem record with little 
detail will mean important items will be forgotten, or those 
present may have  differing recollections.

Interfaces 
261
It is important to remember, for this and other reviews, that lessons can be learned from 
what went well, not just from what went badly. Concentrating on what went wrong may 
lead to a list of recommendations about what not to do next time but gives little guidance 
about what should be done instead. Even when a problem causes a lot of disruption, there 
may still be positive lessons to be learned. For example, the business may comment that it 
was really helpful to have regular updates from the service desk regarding the status of the 
incident that resulted from the problem, because this allowed them to plan how to make 
best use of staff time.
The output from the review should cover what went well, whether anything was done 
that was against the agreed process, any suggestions for improvements for the future, 
and any ideas about how the problem could be prevented in the future. Follow-up actions 
should be assigned to the relevant teams, process owners, or third-party supplier, and 
internal improvements can be entered into the CSI register. It is important that action is 
taken on any improvements identiﬁ ed, whether technical changes to monitoring or logging 
tools, changes to process activities, or addressing training needs which have been identiﬁ ed.
The review may highlight underlying causes that can be handled as part of proactive 
problem management. The service-level manager (possibly accompanied by the problem 
manager) should report to the next service review what improvements have been identiﬁ ed 
and implemented to help prevent future major incidents. This provides assurance to the 
business that the IT service provider is not complacent and is making a genuine effort to 
improve the service.
Interfaces
As we discussed in the section about incident management, the major relationship that 
problem and incident management have is with each other. Problem management does 
interface with other processes, however. The following sections show these interfaces, 
grouped by the lifecycle stage.
Service Strategy
Problem management interfaces with the service strategy ﬁ nancial management process. 
The cost of overcoming problems has to be considered before actions can be taken.
Financial management for IT services Problem management uses this process to assess 
the ﬁ nancial impact of possible solutions or workarounds. This information can be used 
to decide whether a permanent resolution is ﬁ nancially justiﬁ ed. Having the information 
from ﬁ nancial management to be able to assess the cost of downtime and having the cost 
of  providing support for services with unresolved problems will also help you prioritize 
problems. Problem management can use information from ﬁ nancial management to prove 
the cost-effectiveness of resolving underlying causes, rather than spending time resolving 
multiple occurrences of the incident.

262 
Chapter 11 ■ The Major Service Operation Processes
Service Design
The service design processes are intended to deliver services without problems. Not all 
problems can be foreseen, however, and the service design processes of availability manage-
ment, capacity management, and IT service continuity management all take proactive steps 
to identify possible issues and deal with these problems before they result in incidents. This 
is very similar to problem management. How the service-level management process 
interfaces with problems is different; SLM is dependent on problem management to identify 
the root cause of incidents and resolve them in order to prevent downtime that could cause 
a service level target to be breached.
Availability management Availability management has very similar aims to problem mana-
gement: to prevent downtime. The proactive activities undertaken by availability mana gement 
are directly related to proactive problem management; availability attempts to proactively 
identify risks that could result in a loss of service and to take preventative action. Problem 
management can supply information to availability management about the success of any 
measures taken.
Capacity management Some performance problems can be caused by capacity issues. 
Capacity management will be involved in resolving these issues and also taking proactive 
measures to prevent capacity issues. Again, problem management can supply information 
about the success of any measures taken.
IT service continuity management When a signiﬁ cant problem is causing or will cause 
major disruption to the business, it may be necessary to invoke the ITSCM plan until the 
issue is resolved. ITSCM also attempts to proactively identify risks that could result in a 
major loss of service and to take preventative action.
Service level management SLM agrees with the business about the level of service to be 
provided. Incidents and problems will impact the service and may cause the service targets 
to be breached. The service-level manager has to report to the business about any  failures 
and what is being done to avoid them in future. Problem management actions can be 
reported at the service review and may form part of the service improvement plan. SLM 
can assist in the prioritization of problems by providing information about the business 
impact and the effect on services of proposed resolutions. It should be noted, however, that 
SLAs should not contain target problem resolution times; by deﬁ nition, a problem is the 
unknown cause of incidents, so it is not possible to know how long a problem may take to 
ﬁ x. It may be necessary to wait for a recurrence in order to gather sufﬁ cient evidence to 
diagnose the problem.
Service Transition
Problem management interfaces with several of the service transition processes. As discussed 
in relation to incident management, changes may be the cause or solution to problems also. 
SACM provides invaluable information to enable common factors to be identiﬁ ed across 
multiple incidents. Release and deployment is involved in contributing to problem 
management’s known error database, which is also related to knowledge management.

Summary 
263
Change Management When a change is required to resolve a problem or implement a 
workaround, it is submitted to change management in the form of an RFC. Problem 
management will depend on information from change management to know whether such 
a change was implemented successfully. Problem management also has an interface to 
change management when changes introduce problems or cause incidents.
Service Asset and Configuration Management The CMS provides essential information to 
problem management: identifying faulty CIs. The CMS is particularly useful when it is used to 
identify which CI is common to several incidents and which may be the source of the fault (for 
example, when several users, using different applications, complain about a performance issue, 
the CMS may show that all the users are using the same network equipment). The CMS is also 
helpful in identifying the impact of a problem, because it shows the dependencies for each CI.
Release and Deployment Management When a change to resolve a fault is approved by 
change management, it is the change and deployment management process that will implement 
it in the live environment. As part of deploying a new release, it is responsible for ensuring any 
known errors from development are entered into the KEDB. Problem management also has an 
interface to change management when releases introduce problems or cause incidents.
Knowledge Management The KEDB is an essential input into knowledge transfer; the 
SKMS may hold both problem records and the KEDB.
Continual Service Improvement
Problem management and continual service improvement have similar objectives; problem 
management activities can also be seen as CSO activities.
The Seven-Step Improvement Process The aims of CSI and problem management are very 
closely allied. Both seek to drive out errors and improve service quality. As stated earlier, 
actions identiﬁ ed to resolve or prevent problems may be entered into the CSI register. The 
seven-step improvement process can be used by CSI or problem management to identify 
and resolve underlying problems.

Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose and objectives of incident management in reducing downtime by 
resolving incidents quickly. Be able to describe the scope and basic concepts such as major 
incidents, incident models, and the importance of timely resolution. Identify sources of 
incident reports other than users reporting them to the service desk; suppliers, support staff, 
or event management alerts are all possible sources. Understand that incident management 
is a reactive process. Be able to list and explain the interfaces that incident management has 
with other processes, especially problem management and service-level management.
Understand that the aim of incident management is to restore service, not to identify 
the cause. This focus on service restoration means that less-skilled staff are required to 
resolve incidents than problems. Be able to describe the differences between an incident, a 
problem, and a service request.
Explain how priority is calculated, using business impact and urgency. Understand what 
these terms mean.
Be able to explain the concept of incident and problem models and their use. Be able to 
describe the lifecycle of an incident and the use of the different statuses assigned to each 
stage. Be able to list the key information that would be recorded in an incident record. Be 
able to describe the difference between the two types of escalation (hierarchic and 
functional) and when each is used.
Understand the purpose, objectives, scope, basic concepts, process activities, and interfaces 
of problem management. Understand that a problem is the unknown, underlying cause 
of one or more incidents and that the aim of problem management is to ﬁ nd the cause of 
incidents and remove it to prevent recurrence. Be able to describe the relationship between 
problem management and other processes.
Understand the concepts of a workaround and a known error. Be able to explain why 
some problems might not resolved, when it is not cost-effective to implement the ﬁ x, and 
when a workaround exists. Be able to explain how the known error database is used.

OBJECTIVES ARE DISCUSSED 
IN THIS CHAPTER:

Chapter 
12

In this chapter we take a high-level look at the service 
 operation processes of event management, request fulﬁ lment 
and access management, and discuss some of the generic 
 concepts and deﬁ nitions associated with them. These processes happen every day in every 
IT operations environment. Event management describes how the use of monitoring tools can 
not only spot faults very quickly, but also automate many tasks. Access management helps 
protect the organization’s data by controlling who is able to gain access to it. Request fulﬁ l-
ment provides a straightforward and efﬁ cient way to provide standard services to customers. 
Each of these processes, if carried out well, will improve the service to customers. 
Event Management
Modern infrastructure management depends to a large extent on the use of event monitoring 
tools. These tools are able to monitor large numbers of conﬁ guration items simultaneously, 
identifying any issues as soon as they arise and notifying technical management staff. The 
process of event management is responsible for managing events throughout their lifecycle. 
Event management is one of the main activities of IT operations.
An event can be deﬁ ned as any change of state that has signiﬁ cance for the management 
of a conﬁ guration item (CI) or IT service. Note that this does not state that the change of 
state is a failure. Many events are purely informational. Examples of informational events 
could include notiﬁ cation of a user logging onto an application (signiﬁ cant because the 
use of the application may be metered) or a transaction completing successfully (signiﬁ cant 
because the notiﬁ cation of the successful completion may trigger the start of the next 
transaction). An event that notiﬁ es staff of a failure or that a threshold has been breached 
is called an alert. Examples of alerts could include notiﬁ cation that a server has failed 
or a warning that the memory or disk usage on a device has exceeded 75 percent. If you 
consider these concepts in a non-IT environment, a car console may issue an event to say 
that the system has successfully connected to a Bluetooth device, or it might raise an alert 
(together with a beep or ﬂ ashing light) to warn that a threshold has been breached and the 
car is now low on gas.
There are two types of event monitoring tools:
■ 
Active monitoring tools will poll devices to check that they are working correctly. The 
tool will send a message and expect a positive response within a deﬁ ned time, such 
as sending a “ping” to a device. A failure to respond will be notiﬁ ed to support staff. 
Some tools will have automated responses to such situations, perhaps automatically 

restarting a device or rerouting data to avoid the faulty CI so that the service is not 
affected.
■ 
Passive monitoring tools do not send out polling messages; they detect events gener-
ated by CIs and correlate them (that is, identify related events).
The Purpose of Event Management
The purpose of event management is to detect events, understand what they mean, and 
take any necessary action. Many devices are designed to communicate their status, 
and event monitoring will gather these communications and act upon any that need action. 
Some communications report operational information, such as “backup of ﬁ le complete,” 
“print complete,” and so on. These events show that the service is operating correctly. They 
can be used to automate routine activities such as submitting the next ﬁ le to be backed up 
or the next document to be printed. They may also be used to monitor the load across 
several devices, issuing automated instructions to balance the load, dependent on the events 
received. If the event is an alert, such as “backup failed,” “printer jam,” or “disk full,” the 
necessary corrective steps will be taken. An incident should be logged in the case of 
a failure.
The Objectives of Event Management
The objectives of event management include the following: 
■ 
Detecting all “changes of state that have signiﬁ cance for the management of a CI or IT 
service” (see the deﬁ nition of event earlier) and deciding upon the correct response, if 
any. This is then communicated to the appropriate staff to carry out.
■ 
Triggering automated processes or activities in response to certain events. This may 
include automatically logging an incident in the service management tool in the event 
of a failure.
■ 
Providing sufﬁ cient information to enable an accurate assessment of the performance 
of a service against the SLA target. This might include analyzing events that show the 
start and end of a process to enable the elapsed time for its completion to be calculated 
and compared to the SLA target.
■ 
Using such information and analysis as the basis for service reporting, in particular to 
measure the success or failure of improvement actions.
 You do not need to know the process steps in detail for the exam, but an understanding 
of the key points will help you understand its objectives. The ﬁ rst step is the notiﬁ cation 
that an event has occurred. This depends on the monitoring tools being conﬁ gured 
correctly to ﬁ lter out notiﬁ cations that have no signiﬁ cance. Without this, important events 
can be missed or lost among hundreds of spurious notiﬁ cations. The event should then be 
logged; this may be an entry in the event monitoring log, or an automatic link to the incident 
management tool may raise an incident record. In the latter case, this interface should not

269

270 
Chapter 12 ■ The Other Service Operation Processes
be used until the appropriate ﬁ ltering is in place to prevent spurious incidents from being 
raised. An analysis of the event should identify its signiﬁ cance; is it informational, a 
warning, or an exception? Dependent upon this analysis, any required actions are then taken.
The Scope of Event Management
Event management can be applied to any aspects of service management that need to be 
controlled and that could beneﬁ t from being automated. The service management tool set is 
an example, including automatically logging incidents in response to emails or events being 
received, escalating incidents when thresholds have been reached, and notifying staff of 
certain conditions (for example, a priority one incident being logged).
Conﬁ guration items can be monitored by event management tools; this monitoring can 
be for two different reasons:
■ 
Some CIs will be monitored to make sure that they are constantly available. An exam-
ple of this is a network device where action needs to be taken as soon as the CI fails to 
respond to a ping.
■ 
Other CIs may need to be updated frequently. This updating can be automated using 
event management, and the CMS can be automatically updated to show the new state. 
Other areas where event management can be used include the monitoring of environ-
mental conditions. This might be for ﬁ re and smoke detection or for other environmental 
changes.
Using Event Management to Preempt a Major Incident
A large transport organization installed event monitoring across its infrastructure, 
 including monitoring the server room environments. A screen showing current events 
was installed at the service desk. On the second day after this was implemented, its 
value was proved. The service desk called the head ofﬁ ce 150 miles away to ask the staff 
there to check the server room, because there were environmental alerts showing on the 
screen. The head-ofﬁ ce staff entered the server room to ﬁ nd that the air conditioning had 
failed and the room was extremely warm. Had the temperature increased much more, the 
servers would have failed, causing major disruption to the services. The head ofﬁ ce staff 
members were able to avert the incident by using fans to lower the temperature until the 
air-conditioning engineer arrived to ﬁ x the fault.
Tracking license use is another possible use for event management tools; this ensures 
that there is no illegal use of an application by ensuring that the number of people using 
the software does not exceed the licenses held. This may also save money; by showing that 
there is less demand for concurrent use than was thought, the number of licenses can be 

Request Fulfillment 
271
reduced. Monitoring for and responding to security events, such as detecting intruders, 
is another use; the tools can also be used to detect a denial-of-service attack or similar 
event.
In addition to these uses, event management can be used for day-to-day management of 
the service. This might be monitoring performance of hardware or network equipment or 
tracking the use of a particular application.
Monitoring and Event Management
It is important to understand the difference between the two similar but different activities 
of monitoring and managing events.
■ 
Event management is concerned with generating events and detecting notiﬁ cations 
that have been produced. These events are produced so that they can be monitored. 
They provide useful information regarding the status of the infrastructure.
■ 
Monitoring detects these notiﬁ cations but goes further than this. Monitoring includes 
actively checking CIs to ensure that they are working as they should, whether or not an 
event has been generated.
As you have seen, event management can be enormously useful in managing large and 
complex infrastructures. It is often the case, however, that the full value of these tools is 
not realized. This is usually because there has been insufﬁ cient time spent making sure that 
they are conﬁ gured correctly to notify staff only for those events where they need notiﬁ ca-
tion. Failing to specify the correct thresholds, for example, will mean that far too many 
breaches are reported. The staff then ignores the events, because they are seldom signiﬁ cant. 
Of course, this means that signiﬁ cant events are missed. It is all too common that technical 
management teams have impressive plasma screens on the walls with ﬂ ashing red warnings 
that everyone ignores. Sometimes the attitude is that the users will call the service desk 
if there really is an issue, which of course negates one of the major advantages of using 
such tools, that of being able to detect and respond to incidents before the user is impacted! 
Failing to ﬁ lter the events properly means that the ability to automatically raise incidents 
cannot be used, because the service management tool would be ﬂ ooded with multiple 
spurious events.
Request Fulfillment
The second service operation process we will cover in this chapter is request fulﬁ ll-
ment. This is the process for handling requests for standard services, equipment, or 
information.
The service desk is the single point of contact for users for any aspect of the IT service. 
We already discussed in Chapter 10 how the service desk handles incidents reported by users. 
Many of the calls and emails the service desk receives are not reporting anything wrong. 

272 
Chapter 12 ■ The Other Service Operation Processes
They are all the other reasons that the user needs to contact IT, such as for information, for 
the supply of equipment, to provide access to a system or data, to reset a password, to add 
or remove a user, and so on. Often these requests are very standard, low-risk,  common 
changes and as such can be handled by the service desk or second-line support teams, 
without using the normal change management process. In Chapter 8 we covered standard 
changes (low-risk, repeat changes that may be preapproved). Many requests are actually 
requests for changes that fulﬁ ll the standard change criteria and so may be implemented 
without any further authorization being sought. Chapter 8 also looked at “change 
models”—a set of predeﬁ ned steps for use in a commonly occurring set of circumstances, 
allowing particular changes to be handled consistently in an agreed manner. Change 
models are particularly useful in request fulﬁ llment, because they ensure that repeat 
requests are handled correctly. 
ITIL calls all these service requests; they are all opportunities to provide the user with 
something they have asked for, such as information, advice, a standard change, or access 
to an IT service (such as resetting a password or providing standard IT services for a new 
use), and the request fulﬁ llment process is used to handle them.
This process focuses on providing an efﬁ cient turnaround of these requests while 
ensuring that any required authorizations are given. Users appreciate being able to make 
simple requests and have them fulﬁ lled with a minimum of bureaucracy. By handling these 
requests at the service desk (and second-line when required), the cost to the IT service 
provider is also reduced, because more skilled (and therefore expensive) staff members are 
not used to carry out simple tasks.
Purpose
Request fulﬁ llment is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all service 
requests from the users.
Objectives
The objectives of request fulﬁ llment include providing efﬁ cient fulﬁ llment of simple 
requests to meet the requirements of the business. The process provides a simple means 
for the business to receive standard services, delivered quickly and consistently, because 
all the steps required to fulﬁ ll the requests (including obtaining any required authorizations) 
are deﬁ ned. Users have a single source of information regarding the services available and 
how to obtain them. If the user wants to comment on or even complain about a service, the 
same process is used, with a predeﬁ ned escalation of complaints. 
Request fulﬁ llment provides an efﬁ cient way to supply standard equipment to users; 
once an item has been assessed and accepted as compatible with the infrastructure, all 
future requests can be handled through this process. This encourages the use of standard 
equipment and software, because it is the easiest and fastest to obtain.

Improving Efﬁ ciency by Providing a Standard Request Fulﬁ llment Process
A hospital IT department handled requests for hardware and software from the hospi-
tal staff. Users would ask for equipment or software that they had seen advertised in 
magazines or at their local PC store. Often these offered no beneﬁ t over the standard 
equipment in use in the rest of the organization. Each request was handled by the IT staff 
approaching several suppliers to ﬁ nd the best price and then informing the requester 
of the cost so that they could raise a purchase order. The money saved by sourcing the 
cheapest supplier did not cover the cost of the IT staff time it used. The process might 
be repeated several times a week for very similar requests, because each was handled 
separately. When the purchase order was raised, the item would be ordered, and when 
delivered, the support staff would install it; because each item could be different, this 
meant the staff had to ensure that they were following the installation directions for the 
particular model or software. The IT department had then to support all these different 
items and manage the warranty agreements. Occasionally incidents would be caused 
because these nonstandard items were incompatible with a change. The whole process 
was expensive and took up considerable IT time. The process was slow, often taking 
three or four weeks from request to fulﬁ llment, so users would sometimes circumvent it 
by buying and installing items themselves!
A new standard request fulﬁ llment process was introduced to address these issues. 
Following discussion with the business, the IT department agreed on a set of standard 
software and a number of standard devices—a standard laptop and one for “power” 
users, a standard desktop PC, and a standard ofﬁ ce printer. A small stock of each of these 
was bought and put in storage. Users now ordered from this short list, at a set price, 
supplying the purchase order at the time of order. The item was taken from stock and 
installed the same day, while the purchase order was used to replenish the stock. The 
new arrangement suited everybody; the user was happy to forego the ability to order 
any item in return for same-day installation, the IT staff had a simpler range of items to 
support, the IT management was happy to have a less labor-intensive process, and the 
ﬁ nance department was pleased that the IT department was able to negotiate a good 
price from a single supplier in return for a steady stream of orders.
In addition to these beneﬁ ts, the simpler process meant that the service desk was able to 
handle the request, assigning the installation to the desktop support team and ordering 
the replacement. The simple process was very suited to user self-service and became 
one of the ﬁ rst services offered to users on the new self-service portal.
Take a look at the process ﬂ ow shown in Figure 12.1; although you do not need to know 
the process ﬂ ow in detail for the exam, an understanding of what is involved in fulﬁ lling 
service requests will help you understand its objectives.

Access Management 
275
Scope
The scope of request fulﬁ llment will vary from one organization to another; it can include 
any requests that can be standardized and for which organization is happy to use this pro-
cess. Each request should be broken into agreed activities, with a documented procedure. 
These procedures are then used to build the request models.
Some organizations will use the incident management process to handle requests, 
categorizing them as a special type of incident. This has become less common as service 
management tools have increasingly provided request management workﬂ ow capability. 
There are advantages in treating requests outside of the incident process, because they are 
very different. Incidents represent a failure in providing the service, and the aim is therefore 
to reduce the number of incidents. An increasing number of requests, on the other hand, 
may show that the service offered by the IT department is useful and popular. The targets 
for incidents and requests may be very different; requests may have speciﬁ ed lead times, 
which are dependent on other factors (such as the user not being given access until they 
have attended a training course), whereas the aim is to resolve every incident as quickly as 
possible.
Where there are a signiﬁ cant number of requests to be fulﬁ lled, a separate process with 
a different record type should be used. This allows the service provided to be monitored 
and reported on in a more appropriate way than using incident reporting.
Some organizations widen the scope of requests handled by their service desk or 
self-service portal to include non-IT requests, such as building management issues regarding 
cleaning or maintenance issues. Most organizations ﬁ nd that there are also some areas not 
suited to the process, such as requests for new or changed services, which may be handled 
by business relationship managers and will involve service strategy and service portfolio 
management. It would be difﬁ cult to have the service desk collect the detail of such a 
request, and the target lead time would be hard to assess.
Access Management
Access management is the process of granting authorized users the right to use a service 
while preventing access to nonauthorized users. It also is sometimes referred to as rights 
management or identity management. Access requirements can change frequently, and 
 service operation is responsible for granting access quickly, in line with the needs of the 
business, while ensuring that all requests are properly authorized.
Purpose
In Chapter 6, we discussed information security management and its role in deﬁ ning 
security policies. The process for implementing many of these policies is access manage-
ment. This process provides users, who have the required authorization, with the ability to 
use the services they require. Ensuring that only authorized individuals are given access 

276 
Chapter 12 ■ The Other Service Operation Processes
to data is a concern of every IT service provider; failure to carry this out correctly can be 
very damaging and possibly breach legal or regulatory requirements. Consider the damage 
that could be done to an organization discovered to have allowed unauthorized access to 
medical or banking records because of poor access management processes.
Organizations need to ensure that access is managed not only when a new member of 
staff is appointed and set up with access to the systems but also when the staff member 
leaves. A challenge many organizations face is keeping up-to-date with changing access 
requirements as a staff member moves between departments. Often the new access require-
ment is requested, but there is no questioning of whether the existing access rights are still 
required in the new position; therefore, the individual may amass signiﬁ cant rights over 
a period of years if this step is not carried out. It is dependent, in part, on the business 
informing the IT service provider of staff movements; the IT provider should routinely 
query whether existing access is still required when additional access is requested.
There may also be occasions when access is restricted, perhaps during an investigation 
into suspected wrongdoing, to prevent any evidence from being destroyed. Such requests 
would normally be made by senior management or human resources.
Objectives
The objectives of the access management process are to do the following:
■ 
Manage access to services, carrying out the policies deﬁ ned within information secu-
rity management (see the service design stage).
■ 
Ensure that all requests for access are veriﬁ ed and authorized. This may include 
requests to restrict or remove access.
■ 
Ensure that requests are dealt with efﬁ ciently, balancing the requirement for 
authorization and control with the need to be responsive to business requirements.
■ 
Ensure (once access rights are granted) that the rights that have been granted are used 
in accordance with security policies. This might include, for example, the use of 
Internet access for personal use. Although some personal use may be allowed, there 
are likely to be categories of websites that may not be accessed.
Scope
The scope of access management, as we have said, is the efﬁ cient execution of information 
security management policies. By carrying these out, the conﬁ dentiality, availability, and 
integrity (CIA) of the organization’s data and intellectual property are protected. 
Conﬁ dentiality here means that only authorized users are able to see the data. Integrity 
means that the data is kept safe from corruption or unauthorized change. Access 
management ensures that the service is made available to the authorized user; this does not 
guarantee that it will always be available during service hours, because this is the 
responsibility of availability management.

Summary 
277
A request for access will often be made through the request management process. Some 
organizations will maintain a specialized team to carry out the requests, but more 
commonly it is carried out by other functions. Technical and application management 
functions are involved, and a signiﬁ cant part of the process may be handled within the 
 service desk. There should be a single coordination point to ensure consistency.
You do not need to know the access management process in detail for the exam, but an 
understanding of the key points in managing access requests will help you understand its 
objectives.
The ﬁ rst step is to request access. This may be done through the request fulﬁ llment 
 process described earlier or through the completion of a request form. The access request 
has then to be veriﬁ ed before it can be actioned. The identity of the requestor must 
be conﬁ rmed, and the access requirement must be judged as legitimate. The identity may be 
conﬁ rmed by the requestor providing their username and password or, in the case of a new 
user, the request having been made by human resources or a line manager. The validity of 
the request may also be conﬁ rmed by requiring authorization from human resources or an 
appropriate manager.
Once the access has been granted, the status of the user should be monitored to ensure 
that they still have a valid requirement for the access. In practice, this can be difﬁ cult to 
achieve. Access management should be notiﬁ ed of staff that leave so that their access can be 
revoked, and many organizations have robust procedures to ensure that this is done. Many 
organizations encounter difﬁ culty in tracking the changing roles and accompanying access 
requirements of users, especially those who have been in the organization for many years. In 
this situation, new access requirements are added to existing rights, with no  questioning of 
whether these existing rights are still required. Consideration should be given to 
adding questions about existing access requirements to the access request form. The human 
resources department needs to be made aware of the importance of supplying information 
regarding changing job roles to access management in order to protect the organization’s data. 
Access should be revoked when the user leaves the organization; again, the human 
resources department needs to understand the importance of informing access management 
quickly in this situation.
Summary
This chapter explored the remaining three processes in the service operation stage, covering 
the purpose, objectives and scope of each: 
■ 
Event management
■ 
Request fulﬁ llment
■ 
Access management
We discussed the key ITIL concepts of events and alerts and how event management can 
improve availability by preempting failures or reducing the time taken to identify them. 

278 
Chapter 12 ■ The Other Service Operation Processes
We discussed the key ITIL concepts of service requests and how the request fulﬁ llment 
process can save time and money in expediting simple user requirements.
We discussed the importance of access management in preventing unauthorized access 
to data and some of the issues that arise in monitoring access rights: 
■ 
Event
■ 
Alert
■ 
Service request
Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of event management. Be able to describe 
events (a change of state that has signiﬁ cance for the management of a CI) and alerts 
(a failure or a breach of a threshold) and the difference between them. Be able to give 
examples of each.
Understand the role of event management in automation. Be able to describe passive 
and active monitoring and the difference between them. Be able to give examples of each. 
Understand the importance of ﬁ ltering events. Be able to explain how effective event 
management can reduce downtime. Although some requests are standard changes, many 
are not, such as requests for information.
Understand the purpose objectives and scope of request fulfillment. Know how it beneﬁ ts 
the customer and the IT department.
Understand the purpose objectives and scope of access management. Be able to explain 
the relationship between access management and information security management. Access 
management is not just granting access but also restricting or removing it as required.

In this chapter, we’ll cover the continual service improvement 
lifecycle stage. This is a separate stage of the lifecycle, but it 
doesn’t work in isolation. Perhaps even more than any of the 
other stages, this lifecycle stage affects the whole approach for service management. 
The desire to improve is often the driving force behind using the service lifecycle in an 
organization, although it may not be recognized as such at the start.
Following an ad hoc approach to improvement will take an organization only so far; 
the full beneﬁ ts of a continual service improvement approach can be realized only when the 
actions taken are done so as part of a regular program.
It is important to understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of this stage so that the 
full beneﬁ ts can be achieved. It is also a speciﬁ ed part of the foundation syllabus, and you 
may be asked questions about it in the examination. 
Achieving Continual Service 
Improvement
Continual service improvement is key to the success of the service management approach, 
because organizations do not stay static in their requirements. Reviewing performance and 
identifying improvement opportunities allow the continued development of higher-quality, 
lower-cost services, in line with the objectives of the business.
Understanding the Purpose of CSI
The purpose of continual service improvement (CSI) is to continue to support the business 
with IT services in the face of changing business needs. Consider for a moment exactly 
what that may mean in your organization.
In most companies, there are business drivers that cause changes in behavior to meet 
market forces. Organizations that do not respond to outside forces or recognize the need to 
change will usually not survive the rigors of the marketplace. The same should be applied 
to the provider of the IT services that support the business. The idea that an IT service 
provider will be viewed differently is quite surprising, but this is often the perception in an 
IT department. Continual service improvement is there to make sure that the changes in 
business processes that keep the business alive and thriving are recognized and that the IT 
services that support those processes change with them.

Achieving Continual Service Improvement 
285
Think about these statements:
■ 
You cannot manage what you cannot control.
■ 
You cannot control what you cannot measure.
■ 
You cannot measure what you cannot deﬁ ne.
Measurement is critical to the success of continual improvement. Without deﬁ ned 
measures, it is difﬁ cult to manage improvements. CSI is concerned with the improvement of 
all aspects of the service lifecycle, from strategy through design, transition, and operation. 
Failure to implement processes that support your services, which are measurable, 
repeatable, and manageable, will have an impact on the business. It is necessary to engage 
with your organizational goals and use them to provide clear objectives for your IT 
services. If deﬁ ned services and processes do not support business activity, it will become 
increasingly difﬁ cult to keep up with the organization’s need for change. Depending on the 
criticality of the services, the impact on the business may be loss of productivity, higher 
costs, damage to reputation, or potential risk of business failure. Mitigating against or 
preventing such an impact is a key driver for continual service improvement. Applying the 
continual service improvement process across the service lifecycle will enable continued 
support for business activities.
In addition to this, continual service improvement should be seeking improvements in 
cost effectiveness and efﬁ ciency. This application of continually searching for enhancement 
should also be applied across the whole lifecycle, including CSI itself.
The Objectives of CSI
To achieve the purpose for this lifecycle stage, the ITIL Continual Service Improvement 
publication provides the following objectives:
■ 
Review, analyze, prioritize, and recommend improvement opportunities in each 
lifecycle stage: service strategy, service design, service transition, and service operation, 
as well as CSI. Regular activity of this type will move the improvement from an ad hoc 
approach to a genuine improvement initiative.
■ 
Review and analyze service level achievements, according to the service level agree-
ments in place.
■ 
Identify and implement speciﬁ c activities to improve IT service quality, including 
improvements to the effectiveness and efﬁ ciency of the enabling processes. The overall 
service quality is partially dependent on the quality of the processes. It can be  tempting 
for IT services to assume that the only metrics that matter are those relating to the 
technology.
■ 
Improve the cost effectiveness of IT service delivery, without negatively impacting cus-
tomer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is an important measure of the value of the 
service being delivered.

286 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
■ 
Ensure suitable and applicable quality management methods are in use to support the 
continual improvement activities. The quality management methods in use should 
support the overall quality governance in place in the organization.
■ 
Ensure that the processes in use have clearly deﬁ ned objectives and measurements, 
which produce identiﬁ able and actionable improvements. This should be part of the 
controls around the processes in use throughout the service lifecycle.
■ 
Understand what to measure, why it is being measured, and what the successful 
outcome should be. Recognizing exactly what is required will enable a better interpre-
tation of the metrics and the behaviors they will drive.
Setting the Scope for CSI
The ITIL Continual Service Improvement publication provides guidance in four 
main areas:
■ 
The overall health of IT service management as a discipline
■ 
Continual alignment of the IT services with the current and future needs of the 
business
■ 
The maturity and capability of the organization, management, processes, and people 
utilized by the services
■ 
Continual improvement of all aspects of the IT service and the service assets that sup-
port them
It is only by understanding how the improvements are to be carried out, and what the 
desired outcomes are, that you can deliver continual service improvement. The activities 
that support improvement are as follows:
■ 
Reviewing the service performance targets and trends, using the available management 
information, to understand if the desired service levels are being met
■ 
Reviewing process outputs to understand if the required performance is being achieved 
to enable the services
■ 
Regularly carrying out maturity assessments on the processes in use to identify areas 
of concern or demonstrate improvement achievements
■ 
Conducting compliance audits on the processes, ensuring maturity is maintained
■ 
Identifying and making proposals for improvements
■ 
Conducting customer satisfaction surveys as required on a periodic basis
■ 
Reviewing and understanding business trends and projections, maintaining awareness 
of business priorities
■ 
Measuring and identifying the value created by continual improvement initiatives
These activities will require ownership to ensure that they actually get done. 
Improvement activities should be planned and be part of a considered approach, managed 

Achieving Continual Service Improvement 
287
by individuals who have appropriate authority to carry them out. It is important to make 
sure that the processes and services are subject to a continual improvement strategy. This 
strategy should ensure that the improvement initiatives are achieving their targets and 
being kept up-to-date. Speciﬁ c improvements, which require changes, should follow the 
change management process. It is easy for improvement programs to fade, so it is 
necessary for these activities to be monitored as part of the overall continual service 
improvement approach.
How CSI Provides Value to the Business
The adoption of standard and consistent approaches to improving IT service quality 
will result in controlled, gradual, and maintainable improvement. Any improvements 
must, naturally, be cost justiﬁ ed in terms of the return on the investment or, more 
appropriately, on the value of the investment.
By employing regular reviews of the business needs and ensuring that IT services remain 
aligned to them, the business can be assured of an acceptable level of support. Because 
IT services may be said to underpin the success of the majority of organizations, this 
assurance is critical for business conﬁ dence.
One of the key aspects of any improvement is cost, but it is not only the cost 
justiﬁ cation for the initiative; it is also the beneﬁ t that can be achieved in terms of cost. 
An improvement may be able to create cost savings in real terms or increase capability 
for additional workload. Because one of the most common themes of budget negotiations 
is the requirement to achieve more for the same or less than the previous year, this is 
a genuine long-term goal for organizations. Utilizing the techniques and approaches 
of continual service improvement will allow for a gradual and sustained increase in 
capability, because the effectiveness and efﬁ ciency of the processes and services are 
managed.
But it is not only the processes and the services they support that are under the scrutiny 
of continual service improvement. It looks at all elements that enable the delivery of 
services to the business. This will include all resources, partners, technology, staff skills, 
training, and communications. The emphasis on a holistic approach to improvement 
means that true business beneﬁ ts can be achieved by delivering cost-effective enhancements 
across the wider enterprise. For example, renegotiating contracts with third-party suppliers 
may deliver an ongoing beneﬁ t to the business.
To achieve these beneﬁ ts, it is necessary to ensure that monitoring and reporting on 
performance across the service portfolio allows for the identiﬁ cation of improvement 
opportunities.
Utilizing the Continual Service Improvement Approach
We will now cover the approach proposed by ITIL for continual service improvement, 
illustrated in Figure 13.1.

288 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
There are key questions that need to be asked as part of implementing improvements. These 
are all covered by the continual service improvement approach. The ﬁ rst step is to identify 
the vision that is driving the improvement initiative. Understanding the high-level focus of the 
business will allow for the alignment of the IT services and the business strategies.
The question that needs be asked by the IT service provider in this step is “What 
is the vision?” This enables identiﬁ cation of the ultimate and long-term goals for the 
improvement.
Once the vision has been established, the next step requires an objective assessment of 
the current state, namely, a baseline capture of the organization in terms of business, people, 
process, and technology. Utilizing this information will give a picture of the current service 
provision and its quality. The question asked at this step is “Where are we now?”
Having established where you are now, the logical next question is “Where do we want to 
be?” This is not necessarily the achievement of the vision identiﬁ ed at the start of the approach. 
In fact, it is probably unwise to have that as the answer, because unless it is an easily achievable 
goal, it is unlikely to be reached. A better approach is to identify an achievable target, one that 
will enable some quick wins and gain some buy-in for the improvement opportunity. Working 
in small steps, identifying achievable targets that build steady progression to the overall goal 
will enable your improvements to be consolidated at each target.
Targets are important, but equally important is the requirement to understand how 
you achieve them. The next question of “How do we get there?” covers identifying 
the actions needed to meet the targets. This can take a number of different approaches, 
depending on the improvement that is required. It could be process improvements,

technology improvements, or even training for staff. It is important to ensure that this 
activity is captured and managed as part of an overall improvement program. The 
responsibility for monitoring the actions will be critical in achieving the targets, because 
often improvement initiatives will lose focus and fail at this step. Driving the actions and 
maintaining momentum will provide the input for the next step of the approach.
That next step is measuring the achievements, and the question that is applied is “Did 
we get there?” When working on service performance improvements, this is documented 
as part of the service reviews and performance metrics against the required service levels. 
Measuring the actual performance delivery and comparing this to the predicted target will 
provide the answer to “Did we get there?” Speciﬁ c targets in process improvement may be 
measured in terms of a maturity matrix, for the efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the process. 
This is the point in the CSI approach where you understand whether you have achieved 
the goals when asking “Where do we want to be?” This keeps the momentum of your 
improvements going, potentially providing quick wins.
You then need to review your overall objective and begin the cycle of assessment, target 
setting, and measurement again.
Supermarket Improvement Approach
In the United Kingdom, the leading supermarket chain used this approach to reach its 
current position. Over a period of 20 years, the chain has had as its vision “the commitment 
to be the most highly valued company for their customers,” in other words, to be the 
ﬁ rst choice for their customers. To achieve this vision, the company made  incremental 
changes to its overall operation, from the introduction of speciﬁ cally targeted value 
brands to the improvement in logistics and technology within the stores. By building on 
each small success, the company consolidated on its position in the marketplace. It has 
gone from being one of the least successful supermarket chains in the United Kingdom to 
being the most successful. It proudly proclaims its vision and the approach it takes in its 
stores and on its corporate website.
This approach can be adopted at all stages of the service lifecycle, from improvements in 
service strategy to improvements in your approach to continual service improvement itself.
Capturing Your Improvements
Using the CSI approach, you will no doubt end up with more than one improvement 
initiative running at once. It is therefore necessary to manage your improvement activity, so 
you need to have a mechanism for capturing these programs and ensuring that you allocate 
your resources and capabilities efﬁ ciently.
The recommendation for best practices is to develop a CSI register; Table 13.1 shows an 
example, where all the individual improvements can be recorded. This means you can apply 
some categorization and management around the overall CSI approach.

(continued)
As you can see in the example register, the ﬁ rst level of categorization is to establish 
the size of the undertaking or task. The suggested approach is to simply use a broad 
categorization such as small, medium, or large. This will indicate the requirements for 
resources and capabilities for the initiative.
In addition, you need to establish the timescale for the improvement—can it be 
achieved in the short, medium, or long term? A brief description of the initiative will 
provide suitable context for the audience. Also important is to understand the urgency of 
the improvement, and as always within the framework, urgency and impact based on the 
business perspective will identify the priority of the action. The register should also provide 
some indication as to the measures or metrics that will be applied to verify a successful 
outcome from the improvement. The prediction of achievement is an important factor in 
determining success, because this will be compared to the actual achievement for the ﬁ nal 
evaluation.
A brief outline of the justiﬁ cation for the improvement should also be captured as part of 
the register, but the full details of the initiative will be captured as part of the improvement 
program documentation. In the example given, there is no contact information or reference 
to timeframes for completion. Contact information for who raised the improvement and 
who will be working on it and, of course, the date by which it is required will be necessary. 
In this example, there are only a limited selection of possible ﬁ elds; the register should 
contain whatever information you need, according to the requirements of your own 
organization, for managing your improvement programs. 

292 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
The register itself will be classed as a service asset and as such should be managed as an 
item in the service knowledge management system (SKMS). The CSI manager will be 
accountable for managing and coordinating the activities.
Capturing the information about the improvements will provide structure and 
visibility for CSI within the organization. It will be necessary to ensure that the interfaces 
for all processes likely to generate improvement activities are clearly understood 
and their outputs effectively managed through the register, such as problem 
management, capacity management, and change management. This should include 
service review outputs, because this is a common source for ﬁ nding requirements for 
improvements.
Improving Quality with the Deming Cycle
One of the many approaches available in improvement activities is the use of the 
Deming cycle. W. Edwards Deming is best known for his management philosophy, 
leading to higher-quality, increased productivity and a more competitive position for 
the organization. By utilizing the elements of his approach that are applicable for service 
management, you have the Plan-Do-Check-Act steps that make up the Deming cycle, 
illustrated in Figure 13.2.

293
The cycle is now commonly referred to as the PDCA cycle, and we will brieﬂ y cover 
each step.
In the Plan stage, you are doing exactly that, planning the activity for the 
improvement. Ensuring that there is a plan is part of all service management activity, and 
it is also part of the governance controls within standards such as ISO/IEC 20000 (the 
Service Management standard). The PDCA cycle is complementary to the CSI approach 
and the seven-step improvement process. We will cover the seven-step process later in 
this chapter.
In the remaining stages of the PDCA cycle, you carry out the activity as deﬁ ned and 
agreed on in the plan. In the Do step of the process, it is important to capture the 
activity and make updates to the CSI register. Following this comes the Check step, 
which consists of checking on the activity that has been carried out. In terms of ongoing 
improvement, this step and the following step, Act, are used to monitor, measure, review, 
and implement initiatives. At the conclusion of the cycle, there is a consolidation 
effort, which, as you can see in Figure 13.2, prevents the circle from rolling back down the 
slope. The effort of reaching a target may be considerable, but often the effort required 
to maintain the achievement is just as great. The PDCA cycle allows you to manage this 
effectively.
The cycle is underpinned by a process-led approach to its management. This means that 
deﬁ ned processes are in place, the activities are measured for compliance to agreed-upon 
values, and the outputs are audited to identify improvements.
The Role of Measurement in CSI
Measurement is a fundamental part of all processes; in fact, it is one of the key 
characteristics of a process, because all processes must be measurable. CSI cannot take 
place without the results of measurement, so a key part of this lifecycle stage is to identify 
the nature of the measures you want to employ and ensure that these are appropriate to 
identify the improvements that will beneﬁ t the organization as a whole.
To be useful, measures must be objective. The role of measurement is to provide the 
following:
■ 
An assessment of the current status
■ 
The identiﬁ cation of improvement areas
■ 
A measurement of enhancements made
Because your organization’s business processes depend on the delivery of services, you 
must also consider the measures that will be applied to services. Most organizations will 
measure the following:
■ 
Availability of the service
■ 
Reliability of the service
■ 
Performance of the service

294 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
Critical Success Factors and Key Performance Indicators 
ITIL describes a critical success factor (CSF) as something that must happen if an IT 
service, process, plan, process, or other activity is to succeed. Key performance indicators 
(KPIs) are used to measure the achievement of each critical success factor.
The CSI manager will be instrumental in assisting the process owners and managers to 
understand the CSFs for each process and to develop appropriate KPIs to measure their 
success.
Establishing and measuring the CSF for a process will enable an understanding of 
the current state of the process, help identify any required improvements, and measure the 
achievement of any enhancements made.
It is recommended that a service or process have no more than two to ﬁ ve associated 
CSFs at any one time and that each CSF have no more than two to ﬁ ve KPIs for measuring 
success. This way, you can be sure of having manageable measurement and meaningful 
results.
In the early stages of maturity for the process or service, it is probably best to 
limit the numbers of KPIs still further and measure only two or three. You can add 
more as the maturity of the service and the service management processes increases, 
but initially it is important to deﬁ ne the most appropriate measures as a starting 
point. Over time, the requirements for measurement will change, as the maturity 
of associated processes increases or new processes are included in the service 
management scope.
KPIs can be either quantitative or qualitative. It is necessary to identify the speciﬁ c 
metrics and measurements required to calculate the desired KPI. The following sidebars 
show you some examples for both types of KPI.
Qualitative KPIs
CSF: Improving service quality
KPI: 10 percent increase in customer satisfaction rating for handling incidents over 
the next six months

Achieving Continual Service Improvement 
295
Another important aspect that you should consider is whether a KPI is ﬁ t for use. 
There are a number of questions you should ask to determine this. Does the performance 
indicator tell you anything about the goal achievement? If you do not meet the target set 
for the performance indicator, does that mean you will not achieve your goal? Or if you do 
achieve the performance target, will you achieve your goal? Performance indicators should 
be relevant and provide useful information. They should also be easy to interpret and be 
manageable. By this we mean that it should be easy to change the performance indicator 
to meet changing requirements, and it should also be proof against external inﬂ uences. 
Consideration should be given to the frequency of data capture and the availability 
required for the output. What conditions will the performance indicator work under, and 
when will it be impacted sufﬁ ciently so that it will no longer work? And lastly, who owns 
the performance indicator, and who is responsible for collecting and analyzing the data?
KPIs are very important in the overall approach to CSI, and it is important to remember 
that whatever measures you put in place, they will potentially drive behavior, so you should 
be careful to ensure that the behavior you create is desirable. A suite of measures is always 
preferable so that you do not focus on only one particular behavior.

Using Different Types of Metrics
In general, a metric is a scale of measure that allows you to deﬁ ne what is to be measured. 
It is usually associated with a standard or speciﬁ c unit of measurement. Metrics are 
used in a number of different business models including CMMI, COBIT, and Six Sigma 
and typically are used to track performance in the form of KPIs.
There are three types of metrics that an organization will need to collect to support the 
activities of CSI and other service management processes: 
Technology Metrics These metrics are usually associated with managing components, 
using monitoring systems, such as availability monitoring and performance monitoring.
Process Metrics These metrics are captured in terms of the CSFs and KPIs, as you 
explored earlier in this chapter. The overall achievement and maturity of the process can 
be measured in this way. There are four key areas that KPIs can help assess: quality, per-
formance, value, and compliance in following the process. These areas will help identify 
potential improvement opportunities.
Service Metrics Service metrics provide a measure of the end-to-end service performance. 
They consist of the results produced from the technology and process metrics. They are 
often presented in a customer-facing report.
Using Baselines in CSI
Baselines can be used to provide a clear starting point for any improvement activity, so it is 
important that when you capture a baseline, you are assured that it’s accurate.
Taking a snapshot of the infrastructure, services, and processes at a given point in time 
is valuable, but in order to use this as a basis for later comparison or as a starting point, 
the snapshot should be veriﬁ ed against the actual environment before it is declared as an 
ofﬁ cial baseline.
Capturing regular baselines will improve the ability of service management to forecast 
performance requirements. Ensuring that baselines are documented, recognized, and 
accepted through the organization is part of the responsibility of CSI. It is important to 
establish baselines at all levels, including for strategic goals and objectives, tactical process 
maturity, and operational metrics and KPIs.
When you ﬁ rst start to capture data, it may be inaccurate or lacking in integrity, but it 
should form the very ﬁ rst baseline, because it is better to have some data rather than none 
at all. Improvements can be made in the data capture and in the integrity so that future 
baselines will reﬂ ect the improvement that has been made.
The Seven-Step Improvement Process
In this section, you will learn about the seven-step improvement process, a crucial part of 
the success of continual service improvement, as shown in Figure 13.3.

The Seven-Step Improvement Process 
297
The purpose of the seven-step improvement process is to deﬁ ne and manage the steps 
needed to successfully implement improvements. This includes identifying and deﬁ ning the 
measures and metrics; the actions required for gathering, processing, and analyzing data; 
how the results will be presented; and ﬁ nally the management of the implementation of the 
improvement.
The objectives are to do the following:
■ 
Identify improvement opportunities for services, processes, tools, and so on.
■ 
Deliver cost reductions in providing services, while maintaining the levels of service 
and outcomes the business requires. It will be important to ensure that any cost 
reduction does not have a negative impact on the quality of service.
■ 
Identify what needs to be measured, analyzed, and reported to establish improvement 
opportunities.
■ 
Continually align and realign IT service provision with the required business out-
comes, and monitor the service to ensure that your service achievements meet the cur-
rent business requirements.
■ 
Understand what to measure and why it is being measured; deﬁ ne the success outcome.

Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
One of the important considerations for improvement is that it should be cost effective. 
If the cost of implementing the improvement is not signiﬁ cantly outweighed by the beneﬁ t 
that will be achieved, it must be carefully assessed to ensure that it is actually worth the 
ﬁ nancial outlay. This means that each improvement opportunity will require justiﬁ cation; 
in the case of a small-scale improvement, this will be a simple report, but in the instance of 
a more signiﬁ cant activity, a full business case will be needed.
The seven-step improvement process is not designed to be utilized in isolation and will 
be fully effective only if it is applied across all aspects of IT service provision, including 
technology, services, processes, organization, and partners.
The scope should include an analysis of the performance and capabilities of all of these 
aspects, including an assessment of the maturity of the processes enabling each service. 
It will also include making the best use of the technology available and exploiting the 
beneﬁ ts of any new technology, where it is cost justiﬁ able and provides a measurable 
business beneﬁ t. Also within the scope are the organizational structures and capabilities of 
personnel, ensuring that the roles and responsibilities are appropriately allocated with the 
necessary skills.
Each step of the improvement process is designed to assist in the activity of CSI. The 
process makes it reasonably simple to see what takes place; the challenge is to realize this 
in the live environment. The seven-step process spans the entire service lifecycle and is the 
driving force behind continual service improvement.
Step 1: Identify the Strategy for Improvement
Let’s consider the steps in turn, beginning with step 1. In this step, you identify the strategy 
for improvement. The questions you ask here are concerned with establishing the overall 
vision for the business. What are you attempting to achieve for the business? How can you 
support the overall business vision, objectives, and plans? What are the future plans for the 
business—short, medium, and long term? How do your IT services support these goals? 
This analysis will enable you see where the business can best be aided by your efforts.
It will be necessary to review this step on a regular basis to ensure that you are 
continuing to align with the overall business objective. Meeting the requirements of the 
organization should be done according the best possible use of technology, delivering a 
cost-effective solution that enables the business processes at an appropriate level of cost and 
complexity.
 Any initiative that is considered must be logged in the CSI register. If, after review 
of the business case or justiﬁ cation (through the change management process), it is rejected, 
the information can be archived so that you have a complete record of initiatives that have 
not been successful for later comparison.
Triggers and inputs for the improvement process include the following:
■ 
Business plans and strategy
■ 
Service review meetings
■ 
Vision and mission statements

Step 2: Define What You Will Measure
This step is directly related to the goals that have been deﬁ ned for measuring the services 
and service management processes to support the measurement and CSI activities.
In this step, it is necessary to deﬁ ne what you should measure, deﬁ ne and agree on 
what can actually be measured, and then carry out a gap analysis to ﬁ nalize the actual 
improvement measurement plan.
To be effective, this step should focus on a few vital, meaningful measures that support 
qualitative and quantitative assessment of success. These should be usable and provide 
value to the improvement. IT is usually very capable of producing measures, but often the 
measures may deliver little value; too many measures will provide a confusing picture and 
will require rationalization.
Deﬁ ning exactly what will be measured and the value that it will bring is an important 
early step. You need to ensure that you have the capability to capture the data and use the 
measurement. It should also be veriﬁ ed against the needs of the customer; it is not up to 
the IT department to decide what is of value.
The stages of the service lifecycle that support this step in the CSI process are service 
strategy and service design; here you should have established the requirements for 
measurement. It is complementary to the continual service management improvement 
approach, identifying how you will ascertain both “where you are now” and “where you 
want to be.” By using the gap analysis performed as part of this step, you can identify the 
requirements of the stage “how you get there” in the improvement approach.
Inputs to this step include the following:
■ 
SLRs and targets
■ 
Service review meeting
■ 
Service portfolio and the service catalog
■ 
Budget cycle
■ 
Measurement results and reports (for example, balanced scorecard)
■ 
Customer satisfaction surveys
■ 
Benchmark data
■ 
Baseline data
■ 
Risk assessments and risk mitigation plans

300 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
Step 3: Gather the Data
Gathering the data requires having monitoring in place. It is important to remember that 
for CSI data capture you are less concerned with real-time monitoring and more interested 
in the exceptions, resolutions, and trends associated with the data produced. There are a 
number of ways in which you can carry out monitoring of your services, processes, and 
technology.
For your technology monitoring, you can employ tools to automate the activity, 
and these will be part of the component- and application-based metrics that measure 
performance and availability.
Process measurement is a part of every service management process, and the data 
captured will assist in identifying improvement opportunities. The tasks associated with 
this step are as follows:
Task 1: Deﬁ ne monitoring and data collection requirements.
Task 2: Deﬁ ne frequency of monitoring and data collection.
Task 3: Determine tool requirements for monitoring and data collection.
Task 4: Develop monitoring and data collection procedures.
Task 5: Develop and communicate the monitoring and data collection plan.
Task 6: Update availability and capacity plans.
Task 7: Begin monitoring and data collection.
You need to ensure that as part of this step you deﬁ ne the following:
■ 
Who is responsible for monitoring and gathering the data?
■ 
How will the data be gathered?
■ 
When and how often is the data gathered?
■ 
What is the criteria to evaluate the integrity of the data?
It will be necessary to look at the data collected and verify it makes sense in the context 
of the overall service provision. It is this step that enables you to answer the question “Did 
we get there?” from the continual service improvement approach.
Inputs to this step of the process include the following:
■ 
New business requirements
■ 
Existing SLAs
■ 
Existing tools and monitoring capability
■ 
Plans from service management processes (for example, availability and capacity)
■ 
Trend analysis reports
■ 
CSI register
■ 
Gap analysis reports (what you should/can measure)
■ 
Customer satisfaction survey

Step 4: Process the Data
This step allows you to convert the data into the required format for the audience. It 
follows the trail (Figure 13.4) from metric to KPI to CSF, right the way back to the vision, 
if desired.

During this activity, it is common to use report-generating technology to assist with 
the transfer of data into information so that it can be analyzed. Processing the data into 
information allows more successful analytical techniques and will encourage the use of an 
overall perspective on the measurement, by associating data groups to an overall service.
When processing data, it is important to consider the following:
■ 
The frequency of processing the data. This may be driven by the analysis requirements 
and the ability to capture trends.
■ 
The format required for the output, which will also be affected by how the analysis is 
carried out and how the information will be used.
■ 
The tools and systems that are used for data processing.
■ 
The evaluation techniques you will use to verify the accuracy of the data.

302 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
Nearly all of the data captured for CSI is likely to be collected by automation, but 
there will be some elements that require manual capture. When processing the data, it is 
important to remember that data collected from a manual input may need greater effort 
in veriﬁ cation. Stressing the importance of accuracy in data entry to support teams and 
service management staff will help with the ability to process the data.
Inputs to processing data include the following:
■ 
Data collected through monitoring
■ 
Reporting requirements
■ 
SLAs/OLAs
■ 
Service catalog
■ 
List of metrics, KPI, CSF, objectives, and goals
■ 
Report frequency/template
Step 5: Analyze the Information and Data
Analyzing the information and data you have produced so far from the process is crucial to 
enabling its proper use. Without analysis and understanding the context of the information, 
you are unable to make informed decisions. It is necessary to establish what the 
information actually means to the organization. For example, you may have information 
that demonstrates a downward trend in the volume of service desk calls. But is this a good 
thing or a bad? It may be that the volume of calls have reduced because of better service 
quality and availability, or it could be that the service desk is being perceived as ineffective, 
and users are bypassing the service desk and attempting to seek support elsewhere.
Analyzing the data requires a greater level of skill than capturing or processing the data. 
It is necessary to understand the context of the information and compare this to the agreed-
upon targets identiﬁ ed in the service lifecycle.
It is important to ensure that the analysis answers questions such as the following:
■ 
Are operations running to plan? This could be a project plan or service management 
plans for availability, capacity, or continuity.
■ 
Are the targets agreed on in SLAs being met?
■ 
Does the analysis show any structural problems?
■ 
Are improvements required?
■ 
Are there any identiﬁ able trends? Positive or negative?
■ 
Is there an identiﬁ able cause for the trends?
Reviewing the trends over a period of time is important for understanding the context 
and any potential improvement opportunities.
The analysis should be shared with the IT managers and discussed in order to formulate 
plans for improvement opportunities. This output can then be part of the presentation, 
which is the next step in the improvement process.

The Seven-Step Improvement Process 
303
Inputs include the following:
■ 
Results of the monitored data
■ 
Existing KPIs and targets
■ 
Information and perceptions from customer satisfaction surveys
Step 6: Present and Use the Information
In this step, you present the answer to the question “Did we get there?” from the continual 
service improvement approach. You present the knowledge, represented in the reports, 
monitors, action plans, reviews, evaluations, and opportunities, to the target audience.
Understanding the audience for the presentation is important so that you deliver the 
correct format. This needs to be understandable at the right level, provide value, note 
exceptions to services, identify beneﬁ ts, and allow the recipient to make an informed 
decision. This could be at any stage of the service lifecycle—strategic, tactical, or operational.
The created reports should provide emphasis and highlight areas for action to be 
taken to implement improvements. It is too easy for IT departments to provide too much 
information to their target audience, without sufﬁ cient analysis. CSI should be providing 
useful and informative reports so that beneﬁ cial improvement initiatives can be introduced.
There are four common audience types:
The Customers Requiring information on IT services and what will be done if the service 
provision has failed speciﬁ c targets.
Senior IT Management Often focusing on CSFs and KPIs and the actual vs. the predicted 
performance against targets. This may be presented in the form of a balanced scorecard.
Internal IT Interested in KPIs and activity metrics to help plan and coordinate opera-
tional improvement activities.
Suppliers Interested in KPIs and activity metrics related to their own service offerings and 
performance.
It is extremely important that you ensure the knowledge is presented in a meaningful 
way to the audience. For example, using percentage ﬁ gures for availability may not be 
useful for the customer, because it is hard to relate a percentage to an actual outage event 
and understand the business impact.
Inputs to this step of the process include the following:
■ 
Collated information
■ 
Format details—report templates, and so on
■ 
Stakeholder contact information
Step 7: Implement Improvement
In this step, you use the knowledge presented in the previous step and combine it with 
previous experience to make an informed decision about an improvement initiative.

304 
Chapter 13 ■ Understanding Continual Service Improvement
This stage may include a number of actions, from implementing improvement activities 
to submitting a business case to justify an improvement. It will involve integration with 
other service management processes and other lifecycle stages and will include checking 
whether the improvement achieved its objective.
The decision-making process, applying wisdom to the knowledge provided, should 
be communicated across the organization, enabling the eventual improvement to be 
successfully implemented and understood by all stakeholders and practitioners.
After a decision to improve a service and/or service management process is made, then 
the service lifecycle continues. CSI activities take place throughout the service lifecycle. 
A new baseline can be established, and the cycle will begin again.
Inputs to this step include the following:
■ 
Knowledge gained from presenting and using the information
■ 
Agreed-upon implementation plans
■ 
CSI register
The seven steps appear to be a circular set of activities, but in fact the seven-step 
improvement process is actually part of a knowledge spiral. In Figure 13.5 you can see the 
connection from the presentation of data from operational improvements into the capture 
of data for tactical improvements, which in turn will feed its presentation of data into 
strategic improvement activity.

data. Knowledge can be deﬁ ned as information, combined with experience, context, and 
interpretation. Wisdom is deﬁ ned as the ability to make correct judgments and decisions.
The association between the processes of knowledge management and the seven-
step improvement process ensures that the activities are captured as part of the overall 
management of knowledge in the service knowledge management system.

We covered the Deming cycle (PDCA) cycle earlier in this chapter. This quality 
improvement approach is complementary to the continual service improvement process.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the continual service improvement stage of the service 
lifecycle. Speciﬁ cally, you examined the main purpose, objectives, and scope of continual 
service improvement, as well as the value it provides to the business.
You learned about the seven-step improvement process, namely, its purpose, objectives, 
and scope, as well as how to manage the gathering, analysis, and presentation of data to 
enable improvement decisions.
We also covered the continual service improvement approach and its use in the service 
lifecycle. This approach provides a framework for the improvements identiﬁ ed from the 
seven-step improvement process. It is used in conjunction with similar approaches such as 
the Deming cycle. The Deming cycle takes the steps of Plan, Do, Check, and Act to 
ensure the continuation of quality services.
Improvements are managed through the CSI register, allowing overall management of all 
improvement initiatives in a centralized register.
Measurement is a vital part of all improvements, and we covered the approach to 
measurement as part of continual service improvement. We reviewed the types of metrics in 
use, the relationships between critical success factors and key performance indicators, and 
the use of baselines for assessing improvement progress.
Exam Essentials
Understand the purpose, objectives, and scope of the CSI lifecycle stage. It is important to 
remember that CSI is concerned with maintaining IT services in line with business needs, 
not simply to meet service targets. This should be done on a regular basis and applied to all 
areas of service management.
Recall the steps of the CSI approach and of the Deming cycle. The CSI steps identify the 
approach taken to manage an improvement initiative and ensure it continues to meet the 
objectives of the business. The Deming Cycle consists of Plan, Do, Check, and Act, and its 
aim is to ensure consolidation of achievement and a managed improvement approach to 
quality services.
Understand the purpose of the CSI register. The register enables the tracking and man-
agement of the improvement initiatives being undertaken by the IT service provider. It is 
maintained and managed by the CSI manager.

Exam Essentials 
307
Identify the different types of measures and three types of metrics: technical, process, and 
service. Measures include critical success factors, key performance indicators, and how 
these are used in each service lifecycle process. The three types of metrics interact to pro-
vide a complete measurement of the service, which can be presented in a customer-facing 
format.
Understand the use of baselines. Baselines are used in continual service improvement as a 
comparison point for verifying improvement activity.
Understand the use of the seven-step improvement process, and recall the steps of the 
process. This process is used to manage the gathering, analysis, and presentation of data.
Know how the seven-step improvement process integrates with the DIKW knowledge 
model and the Deming cycle. Understand the interaction of each step of the seven step 
process with the DIKW and Plan-Do-Check-Act.

4. 
C. This is the ITIL definition of an outcome, the result of doing something.
5. 
A. This is the ITIL definition of the makeup of an IT service: the combination of processes 
(strategic, design, transition, operations, and improvement), the underlying infrastructure 
and applications the service is dependent on, and the roles required to support the service 
through the lifecycle.
6. 
B. There is no “supplier service” type identified. If services are provided by external parties, 
they would be either core, enabling, or enhancing.
7. 
C. Both of these statements are correct.
8. 
D. This is the ITIL definition for an IT service provider, providing IT services to 
customers.
9. 
C. There are three types of IT service provider: Type I internally embedded within a 
 business unit, Type II internally shared between business units, and Type III external.
10. A. Functions are self-contained units of an organization with their own resources and capa-
bilities to support an organization. Processes deliver value and define roles for the activities 
and decisions within that process.
Chapter 2: Understanding 
Service Strategy
1. 
C. The strategic phase of the lifecycle is concerned with the high-level planning of a lifecy-
cle approach for all services and the supporting processes of service management to support 
the services.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
313
2. 
B. Strategy is concerned with ensuring business outcomes are met by the services and 
service management processes. Customer satisfaction and measuring improvements are the 
concern of continuous service improvement.
3. 
C. The value of a service is always based on a customer’s perspective. The service is 
 delivered to support a customer’s needs.
4. 
C. Who designed the service is not a necessary piece of information for defining value; you 
should focus on the deliverables and cost.
5. 
D. The customer is interested in the value the service provides to them and is not interested 
in the preferences of the service provider.
6. 
C. Utility means the service is “fit for purpose” because it has the functionality to support 
business outcomes.
 
“Fit for use” refers to how it is delivered with assurances in relation to capacity, availability, 
security, and continuity.
7. 
A. Financial capital is classed as a resource, and organization and knowledge are capabilities. 
People can be classed as both: a resource because of the number of people and a capability 
because of the skill set of the people.
8. 
D. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CAB does not assess all changes, and governance does not 
control this.
9. 
B. Calibrate risks is not a stage in the risk management approach. It is important to identify 
risks and to analyze these risks to understand how likely they are to happen and the impact 
if they did occur. Based on that information, an appropriate response is required to control 
and manage the risk. 
10. A. A PBA profile is created to define and understand PBAs to ensure alignment to services. 
It needs to be classified and to include customer requirements, the capabilities, and the 
resources required to provide the service in some detail.
Chapter 3: Service Strategy Processes
1. 
B. The service portfolio contains details of all services to be under control (pipeline) or live 
(catalog) or retired. It should provide sufficient detail to ensure the service provider is giving 
the customers the services required to support business needs.
2. 
C. Service portfolio management is responsible for creating and maintaining a service portfo-
lio, which consists of the details of all services to be under control (pipeline) or live (catalog) or 
retired. It should provide sufficient detail to ensure the service provider is giving the customers 
the services required to support business needs. Option A is an objective of change manage-
ment, option B is an objective of service asset and configuration management, and option D is 
an objective of service-level management.

314 
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
3. 
B. Projects are not captured in the service portfolio; IT services are captured in the service 
portfolio.
4. 
D. Monitoring service performance is performed by service-level management; comparing 
results of improvement initiatives is carried out by CSI.
5. 
A. The service portfolio consists of a service pipeline, service catalog, and retired services.
6. 
D. Financial management is concerned with funding IT services throughout their 
lifecycles.
7. 
B. Financial management consists of budgeting, accounting, and charging.
8. 
A. All of these are recommended elements of a business case.
9. 
C. Business relationship management is concerned with creating and maintaining relation-
ships between the customer and the service provider.
10. D. BRM is concerned with a high-level relationship with customers. The other answers are 
very specific and may be activities BRM has an interest in but only to suffice the overall 
objective of building and maintaining business relationship.
Chapter 4: Understanding 
Service Design
1. 
A. All four of these elements are included in the service design.
2. 
C. Service design should design services that meet the business requirements but can be 
improved in the future as business requirements change.
3. 
B. Service design does not consider changes to business strategy; this is the remit of service 
strategy and continual service improvement. Design should be to customer requirements, 
right the first time, and to the standards and controls agreed on within an organization.
4. 
D. This is a description of a service design package, a major output from service design 
ensuring the service is fully documented and able to pass through transition activities into 
operations where it can be used, delivered, and managed with appropriate reporting to 
allow for any necessary improvements.
5. 
C. These are the four major areas that need to be considered for a holistic design: people 
to use the service as well as those to design, transition, and operate it; processes to support 
design, transition, operation, and improvement of the service; product (technology, such as 
infrastructure and applications) to enable the service; and partners, which are any external 
suppliers required to assist with the design.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
315
6. 
B. All of these are identified as part of service composition. Resources are the actual peo-
ple, applications, information, infrastructure, and financial capital required to support the 
service; capabilities manage and control resources appropriately; the functionality require-
ments (utilities) ensure the service is fit for purpose; and the warranty requirements ensure 
the service is delivered so it is fit for use.
7. 
D. The service solution is an output from service design, not a constraint.
8. 
C. The service design package does not include the organizational business strategy, 
because that is already in existence within the business. All other items are created during 
the design phase and reside in the SDP.
9. 
A. Architecture according to ITIL encompasses the technologies required to create a service—
such as infrastructure, application, database, and environments—and how these technologies 
link together.
10. B. These are the five major aspects of service design. The SDP is an output that would con-
tain a service transition plan. Business strategy has already been considered at the strategy 
level; it would help shape the requirements that go into designing the service solution, one 
of the major aspects.
Chapter 5: Service Level Management: 
Aligning IT with Business Requirements
1. 
A. This is the purpose of service-level management. Option B is a purpose of business rela-
tionship management, option C is a purpose of the service desk, and option D is a purpose 
of service transition.
2. 
B. This is an agreed-upon objective of service-level management and reflects the steps of 
the process. Option A is an objective of change management, option C is an objective 
of request fulfillment, and option D is an objective of problem management.
3. 
C. These are the correct statements; the other statements refer to service asset and configu-
ration management and change management.
4. 
D. Customer-based service provider is not a recognized type of service provider. Embedded 
is Type I, Shared is Type II, and External is Type III.
5. 
B. Warranty refers to the achievement of fit for use, assuring levels of availability, capacity, 
security, and continuity, which usually have agreed-on targets within SLAs and are service-
level requirements to assist with shaping the service solution.
6. 
C. The service-level agreement does not include the definition of business strategy but does 
contain relevant information about the service(s) supported by the agreement.

316 
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
7. 
C. An OLA and a contract support the achievement of an SLA. The OLA is the internal 
agreement based on the ongoing activities of internal service providers, and the contract is 
the legally binding document supporting service delivery by an external supplier.
8. 
D. This is the definition of an underpinning contract as described in the ITIL framework. Con-
tracts are required for external suppliers regarding their commitments to providing service.
9. 
A. These are the three types of service-level agreement in a multilevel structure.
10. B. These reports are sometimes known as RAG reports, for red, amber, green. Green means 
everything is within target, amber means there is some concern, and red is an exception.
Chapter 6: The Other Service Design 
Processes
1. 
C. Option A refers to an SLA, option B refers to the service portfolio, and option D refers 
to a business case. Option C is the ITIL definition of the service catalog.
2. 
C. Retired services are part of the portfolio, not the catalog. ITIL does not define strategic 
services.
3. 
B. The service catalog contains customer-facing and supporting services and forms part of 
the service portfolio.
4. 
C. Option C is the ITIL definition. Agreed service time is the time a service should be avail-
able as agreed on within an SLA or underpinning contract, and downtime is an unplanned 
interruption to service.
5. 
B. This is the ITIL definition. It refers to part of a business process that is critical to the 
success of the business.
6. 
C. MTBSI stands for mean time between service incidents.
7. 
D. These are all terms that are part of the availability management process. The others are 
not ITIL terms.
8. 
C. Items 1, 2, and 3 are all responsibilities of ISM. Implementing is one of the responsibili-
ties of release and deployment management; no other ITIL process has a responsibility for 
implementation.
9. 
A. The SMIS is the security management information system. The KEDB is the known 
error database that is used by problem management. The other terms are not ITIL terms.
10. D. Supplier management does not deal with internal suppliers; it manages all aspects of 
contract management with third parties to ensure value for money.
11 C. Trusted is not a supplier type described in ITIL.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
317
12. A. It is service level management that is responsible for negotiating the SLA contents 
(although the service level manager would consult with capacity management before 
 agreeing on capacity requirements). The other three are core responsibilities of capacity 
management.
13. A. This is the ITIL definition of the three subprocesses of capacity management.
14. C. This is the ITIL definition.
15. C. It is not the job of ITSCM to ensure that the business has contingency plans; this is the 
role of business continuity management. ITSCM is concerned with the IT services only.
16. D. This is the ITIL definition.
17. B. Design coordination does not design the solution; it coordinates activities and resources.
18. D. The configuration management system (CMS) and governance requirements are not out-
puts of this process. They are actually inputs to it.
19. C. The service catalog shows how each operational service supports particular business 
processes - this is useful to customers. The technical view of the catalog shows the support-
ing services which make up the service.
20. C. It is the responsibility of the business to plan for business continuity in the event of 
major disruption, based on business priorities. This will define what level of IT service will 
be required in that eventuality, and ITSCM is then responsible for planning how this could 
be provided.
Chapter 7: Service Design Roles
1. 
B. This is one of the defined responsibilities of the process practitioner, who is responsible 
for carrying out the process and documenting its activities.
2. 
D. This is the correct list of role responsibilities in the RACI model as described in ITIL 
and other methodologies.
3. 
B. This is one of the process owner responsibilities.
4. 
A. Managing a process requires resources; therefore, the process manager is responsible 
for this.
5. 
B. There can be only one person accountable, and not all activities or decisions need to 
include Consulted or Informed.
6. 
D. The RACI model defines who is responsible, accountable, consulted, or informed for 
each process activity.

318 
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
7. 
C. ITIL specifies that the process owner is accountable for the process, and there can be 
only one person accountable.
8. 
C. Creating and maintaining the process documentation are the responsibilities of the 
 process owner.
9. 
D. ITIL does not describe a role of process improvement manager. The process owner and 
manager roles have responsibility for identifying possible improvements.
10. B. The service owner has responsibility for representing the service, and this includes 
attending the CAB meeting to discuss any amendments to the service, to ensure that the 
risk assessment had been carried out correctly, and to minimize the chances of the change 
failing and affecting the service. The service owner is also responsible for attending 
service reviews with the business (with the service level manager). The responsibility of 
maintaining the known error database belongs to the problem manager.
Chapter 8: Understanding Service 
Transition and the Change 
Management Process
1. 
A. This is the purpose of the service transition lifecycle stage, to ensure that the new or 
changed service is delivered into operation successfully. 
2. 
C. Service transition provides value by delivering services consistently, controlling IT assets 
and increasing confidence in the success of changes.
3. 
B. The purpose of change management is to provide controlled change across the whole of 
the service lifecycle.
4. 
C. Change management does not cover business, project, or minor operational changes. 
The change process is used for IT service changes.
5. 
D. A change model provides predefined steps for handling changes of a similar type. This 
provides a repeatable and consistent approach to managing changes of similar type.
6. 
B. A standard change has a low or clearly understood risk, follows a predefined procedure, 
and has a predefined trigger. 
7. 
A. Change proposals are authorized if the change has a major impact on the business in 
terms of cost, risk, or resources. A proposal is used to ensure that any major change is justi-
fied before raising the request for change. 
8. 
D. The change schedule, projected service outage, and remediation plan are all recognized 
outputs from the change management process. The change schedule shows the proposed 

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
319
authorized changes, and the project service outage document shows the outage of the ser-
vice. A remediation plan is the plan for how to recover in the event of a failure in change 
implementation.
9. 
A. Changes are authorized by the change authority. The change authority will depend on 
the nature, size, and risk of the change being authorized.
10. B. A change record can be closed only once the change acceptance criteria have been met.
Chapter 9: Service Transition Processes
1. 
A. Transition planning and support provides overall planning for service transitions and 
coordination of the resources they require. Option B refers to a change management 
 purpose, option C refers to a purpose of design coordination, and option D would be 
involved in the planning phase of release and deployment.
2. 
C. These statements are both objectives of transition planning and support, ensuring that 
transitions are managed effectively.
3. 
B. The purpose of the SACM process is to identify and control the assets that make up your 
services and maintain accurate information about these assets. The management of the 
changes to your service assets is a purpose of change management.
4. 
D. SACM is a process that supports all stages of the service lifecycle by providing informa-
tion about the assets that make up your services.
5. 
C. A configuration record captures the information about a configuration item and records 
the attributes and relationships. It is stored in the CMDB. Option A is a service asset, 
option B is a configuration item, and option D is an activity carried out in SACM.
6. 
A. The layers of the CMS are closely associated to the Data-Information-Knowledge-
 Wisdom model from knowledge management; the presentation layer allows for decision 
making based on the analysis and processing of data.
7. 
B. This is an objective of the SACM process; knowledge management does not cover the 
detail of the service assets that make up the services.
8. 
C. SACM is the process that manages the naming convention for the configuration manage-
ment database. Release management is concerned with the release controls that are specified 
in the release policy.
9. 
D. Verification and audit is a step in the process of SACM to ensure the accuracy of the 
data in the CMS.
10. C. Early life support takes place in the deployment phase, where the handover to service 
operation takes place.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
Chapter 10: Delivering the Service: 
The Service Operation Lifecycle Stage
1. 
D. This is one of the defined service operation activities. Testing and rolling out are transi-
tion activities, and decisions about service retirement are made in the strategy stage.
2. 
D. Design coordination takes place only as part of design. Availability management takes 
place in service operations, because reasons for downtime are examined and actions are 
taken to prevent recurrence. ITSCM plans are rehearsed and updated as part of service 
operations. Performance against service level targets is measured in service operations, and 
both incident and problem management seek to reduce or prevent downtime that could 
threaten the achievement of the SLA targets.
3. 
C. These are the four functions described in ITIL. The facilities management responsibil-
ity in option A forms part of the operations management function. The infrastructure 
management and desktop management responsibilities in option B are not ITIL functions; 
infrastructure management will be carried out by the technical management function, and 
desktop support is usually part of operations management.
4. 
B. This is the responsibility of technical management. The air conditioning and power man-
agement responsibilities are part of facilities management’s responsibilities for maintaining 
the physical operations environment.
5. 
B. The responsibilities of each function defined in ITIL include the activity listed in option B.
6. 
C. This is the responsibility of the problem management process; the service desk deals 
with incidents and does not resolve the underlying problems that would then prevent the 
incident from recurring. Service desks should resolve all straightforward incidents in order 
to provide a faster and more efficient support service than would result from escalating 
them to the next support level.
7. 
B. The service desk logs incidents and requests and ensures that they are dealt with. 
It owns the incident and request throughout its lifecycle, ensuring that the customer is 
happy with the outcome and that service levels are met.
8. 
D. Service desk staff members do not need specialist technical skills, but they need to have 
sufficient technical ability to resolve straightforward incidents; they need customer service 
skills to deal with users and business knowledge to assess priority.
9. 
D. These are the two aspects described in ITIL. Facilities management refers to the management 
of the physical environment of IT operations, usually located in data centers or computer rooms. 
Operations control refers to the carrying out of routine operational tasks, centralized monitor-
ing, and control activities, usually using an operations bridge or network operations center.
10. B. The other three structures are described in ITIL, along with centralized. A local service 
desk structure will have a service desk co-located with users in each location. Virtual ser-
vice desk structures provide a number of desks, with calls shared between them. “Follow 
the sun” will have all calls routed to a service desk dependent on time zones; all calls will 
be handled by a day shift.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
321
Chapter 11: The Major Service 
Operation Processes
1. 
B. This is the ITIL definition. Option A could be describing an incident, but option B is a 
clearer definition. Option C describes a problem, not an incident.
2. 
C. Option A describes when a problem, not an incident, should be closed. Option B is 
incorrect, because the user must agree before the incident is closed. Option D is incorrect 
because there is no mention of a resolution.
3. 
B. Incident resolution is about restoring the service; option B is a problem management 
activity and does not help the user at the time. The other options all attempt to overcome 
the issue for the user.
4. 
C. This is the ITIL definition. Normal service is that agreed on and documented within 
SLAs or contracts.
5. 
C. This is the ITIL definition of an incident model.
6. 
D. This is what ITIL recommends. Incidents may also result from events or from technical staff.
7. 
B. This is the ITIL definition of how to calculate priority.
8. 
B. ITIL defines hierarchical escalation (going up the chain of command) and functional 
escalation (passing incidents to more technically knowledgeable teams).
9. 
C. ITIL defines problems as the cause of one or more incidents. Options A and D are inci-
dents, and option B is a possible root cause.
10. D. Problem management may provide a workaround while waiting for a permanent resolu-
tion. This would be documented as a known error. If the resolution required a change, an 
RFC would be raised.
Chapter 12: The Other Service 
Operation Processes
1. 
D. The purpose of the request fulfillment process is to separate the common, low-risk 
requests and expedite them. Service requests do not need CAB approval. RFCs and emer-
gency requests for change need to go through the appropriate change process.
2. 
A. Service desk staff deal with many requests, with second-line staff carrying out installa-
tions, moves, and so on. Requests do not come under the responsibilities of SLM or BRM.

322 
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
3. 
C. Requests that are changes will be standard changes and can be preauthorized; they do 
not need authorization by the CAB. Changes that needed technical approval would go 
through the change process, not the request process. If an expense is to be incurred, this 
will need to be accounted for and authorization granted.
4. 
D. Option 3 requires a change to functionality that would need to be fully considered and 
costed; it would need to go through the change process. The others are all requests for 
information or standard services and are therefore service requests.
5. 
D. Situation 2 B would not be helped by using events. Situation 1 would detect an alert that 
a time threshold or a priority condition existed and would carry out the escalation defined. 
Situation 3 would similarly respond to a particular event such as an alarm and would auto-
matically notify the police station. Situation 4 could use the events signifying the successful 
backup of each file to automate the start of backing up the next file.
6. 
C. These are all examples of where event management can be used. Monitoring heat and 
moisture content can be done through event management, and actions are taken if they 
breach acceptable parameters. Licenses can be controlled by monitoring who is signing 
onto applications and raising an alert if the maximum legal number is breached. Staff ros-
ters do not have changing conditions that could be monitored by the use of events.
7. 
B. This is the definition of a request given in this chapter. A request may involve a standard 
change, but that may be true only in some cases, so it is not a good description. An RFC is 
part of the change process, not the request process. A request may involve procurement, but 
only in some cases, so it is not a good description.
8. 
C. Types 1 and 3 are the two types of event monitoring described in the chapter. Passive 
monitoring waits for an error message to be detected, and active monitoring checks periodi-
cally on the “health” of the CI. The other two are not recognized event types in ITIL.
9. 
C. Option C is the definition given in the chapter of an alert. Option A is the definition of 
an incident. Option B is the definition of a problem. Option D is the definition of an event.
10. B. Option A is incorrect because security management does not remove or prevent access. 
Option C is incorrect because security management is responsible for setting policies. Option 
D is incorrect because access management carries out the wishes of whoever is responsible for 
authorizing access (usually a business manager); it does not make the decision.
Chapter 13: Understanding Continual 
Service Improvement
1. 
A. The purpose of CSI is correct in statement 1. This lifecycle stage should ensure you con-
tinue to support the business in response to changes in business need. The second statement 
is the purpose of the service strategy lifecycle stage.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions 
323
2. 
B. Options A and D are service transition objectives; option C is an objective of service 
strategy. CSI is concerned with the identification of improvement opportunities across the 
whole of the service lifecycle.
3. 
C. CSI provides guidance on IT service management improvements, not on business strategic 
planning. This includes the continual alignment of IT services with business requirements 
and the maturity and capability of the service provider. It will include all aspects of the ser-
vice because everything may be included in an improvement initiative.
4. 
D. This is the correct sequence of events for the CSI approach. You can verify this by 
reviewing Figure 13.1.
5. 
C. To maintain and manage improvements, you should be utilizing a CSI register. Captur-
ing details of the improvements that are taking place allows you to manage and coordinate 
improvement activities. Capturing details of the infrastructure is covered by service asset 
and configuration management, and the service catalog provides details of the operational 
services. The service knowledge management system captures details of the information used 
for service management.
6. 
D. Plan, Do, Check, Act make up the four stages in the Deming cycle.
7. 
A. KPIs measure critical success factors, which are those elements that enable understanding 
of the current state of the process, help identify any required improvements, and measure the 
achievement of any enhancements made.
8. 
B. Both of these statements about baselines are correct. Baselines are used by CSI to ensure 
that you have a regular capture of the state of the operational environment, allowing for 
comparison to demonstrate or track improvements.
9. 
B. Step 2 (define what you will measure) and step 3 (gather the data) are aligned to the Data 
part of the DIKW structure. In the DIKW model, the starting point of all capture begins 
with data, and to do this, you should ensure you define the requirements for your data cap-
ture activity by understanding what you will measure and then gathering the appropriate 
data.
10. A. You need to ensure you engage with suppliers who support your services; it’s a vital part 
of your approach to improving the quality of service provision. It is important to ensure you 
review all of the stakeholders engaged in the delivery of services, as well as those receiving 
them. External or business users will not be reviewing the key performance indicators to 
help them understand the use of services, because this information will not be provided by 
the KPIs. Project managers will not be reviewing CSFs for service management processes, 
because these will not demonstrate how to improve project plans.

Troubleshooting
Wiley has attempted to provide programs that work on most computers with the minimum 
system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some programs may not work 
properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) for the pro-
grams you want to use or you have other programs running that are affecting the installa-
tion or running of a program. If you get an error message such as “Not enough memory” 
or “Setup cannot continue,” try one or more of the following suggestions and then try 
using the software again:
Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation programs 
sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer incorrectly believe that 
it’s being infected by a virus.
Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the less memory 
is available to other programs. Installation programs typically update ﬁ les and pro-
grams, so if you keep other programs running, installation may not work  properly.
Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This is, admittedly, 
a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding more memory can really help 
the speed of your computer and allow more programs to run at the same time.
