AMD Ryzen: Set Disruptors To Stun

NZXT Introduces New Aer F Fans
NZXT announced its new Aer F, a case fan that features 
removable trim pieces that buyers can purchase separately. 
The Aer F fans are available in two sizes: 120mm and 
140mm. They have fluid dynamic bearings that are meant 
to last for at least 60,000 hours, or six years of operation. 
The PWM fans have sleeved cables, and NZXT says the 
blades were designed to improve airflow and reduce noise. 
The fans are basic black, but the circular trim pieces snap 
in place around the frame that surrounds the blades. These 
pieces let users add a touch of red, white, or blue to the fans 
to match the decor of their builds. The trim pieces come 
in pairs at both fan sizes for $5.99/pair. MSRP for the new 
Aer F fans is $17.99 for 120mm and $19.99 for 140mm. 
Twin packs of fans offer the ability to buy multiple fans 
at a discount. The 120mm twin pack is $29.99 while the 
140mm twin pack is just $32.99.
Corsair Launches First RGB DDR4 
Memory Under Vengeance Brand
Corsair launched an RGB version of its Vengeance DDR4 
memory. The new line is the first memory from the company 
to include RGB lighting. The new Vengeance RGB DDR4 
has four lighting modes: static, breathing, rainbow, and color 
shift. Builders can use Corsair LINK software to customize 
the lighting to match their builds or provide additional 
information, such as having colors reflect system temperature 
ranges. Corsair says the memory modules use high-quality 
components such as hand-screened ICs and customized 
PCBs that provide superior performance when overclocking. 
The heat spreaders on the modules also are designed to 
provide greater stability under load. The new RGB memory 
is available immediately in kits of 16GB (2 x 8GB) and 32GB 
(4 x 8GB); both kits have a frequency of 3,000MHz. The 
company says additional capacities and frequencies will be 
added soon.

Logitech Introduces New G Pro 
Mechanical Gaming Keyboard
Logitech announced a new mechanical gaming keyboard. The 
company says it developed the G Pro Mechanical Gaming 
Keyboard for professional-level gaming competitions, and 
that its design team worked with pro eSports gamers to 
create the new plank. The G Pro is a small keyboard with a 
tenkeyless design, and it uses Logitech’s proprietary Romer-G 
mechanical switches. The Romer-G switches register key 
presses at 1.5mm, which the company says is up to 25% 
faster than other mechanical switches. The compact plank 
has a steel backplate that adds durability. Pro gamers travel 
with their keyboards from tournament to tournament, so 
the G Pro comes with a detachable micro-USB cable. The 
keyboard has RGB lighting and onboard memory for saving 
personalized settings. Logitech says the new G Pro will be 
available at retail soon with an MSRP of $129.99.
EKWB Now Gives You Pivoting Ports
EK Water Blocks has released an ingenious GPU terminal with 
dual ports that swivel a full 360 degrees, so you can install your 
liquid-cooling pipes from any angle. The EK-FC Terminal 
Rotary 90 has standard G1/4” port fittings that sit at 90 
degrees to the block, which may be preferred or even required 
depending on certain build configurations. But arranging for 
piping to fit a typical 90-degree port can limit your cooling 
options, as the piping has to be set in one direction. EKWB’s 
new terminal is much more accommodating, as the ports can 
swivel a full 360 degrees. This means your inflow and outflow 
piping can come from any direction. The new terminal is made 
of PTFE-coated forged brass, and the black finish will work 
with the color scheme in any build. The part can be swapped 
out for the stock terminal in any current EK full-cover GPU 
waterblock (EKWB notes on its website that the terminal is not 
compatible with original CSQ design full-cover blocks). The 
MSRP for the new EK-FC Terminal Rotary 90 is $24.95.
X2 Products Adds White Version 
To Its Empire Gaming Case Line
Netherlands-based X2 Products has introduced a white version 
of its Empire gaming chassis. The steel ATX case has a trapezoid 
shape with a distinctive angular sloping front that sports a red 
X2 logo. The case comes with two RGB LED fans and features 
large acrylic side windows. 
The Empire has plenty of room inside. It can handle graphics 
cards up to 400mm long and as many as seven 120mm fans. 
There’s also room for a radiator up to 360mm for folks who 
prefer liquid-cooling setups. The case has seven expansion slots 
and three internal 3.5-inch drive bays. 
X2 Products says the white version of the X2 Empire carries an 
MSRP of $99.99.

HARDWARE MOLE
BIOSTAR Announces M200 Series 
SSDs For Compact M.2 Form Factor
BIOSTAR has launched a new line of SSDs that use the M.2 
2280 form factor. The company calls the compact SSD line the 
M200 Series. Drives in the M200 Series are extremely small and 
draw a minimal amount of power, so they are being targeted 
at users with notebooks, HTPCs, and other small-form-factor 
systems. The drives feature a Marvell controller and BGA 
memory and transfer data at SATA3 6Gbps speeds. 
BIOSTAR says the M200 Series will be available in two 
capacities, 120GB and 240GB. Maximum read speed for both 
capacities is 530MBps. Maximum write speed for the 120GB 
drive is 380MBps, while the 240GB drive reaches write speeds 
of 410MBps. Both models of the drive support Windows, 
Linux, and Mac operating systems.
MSI Introduces The Z270 
MPOWER GAMING TITANIUM
MSI announced the Z270 MPOWER GAMING 
TITANIUM, an imposing looking motherboard that 
bristles with metal armor and heatsinks. On the back, 
the socket 1151 board has a gigantic “titanium” backplate 
to help support the big graphics cards and coolers. The 
motherboard is loaded with the latest hi-tech goodies 
and can handle up to 64GB of DDR4-4000. It supports 
Intel Optane and has three Turbo M.2 slots with Shield 
thermal protection. The TITANIUM supports NVIDIA 
SLI as well as AMD CrossFire, and it comes with Killer 
GAMING LAN for low latency while gaming online. 
The motherboard also lets you control your entire system’s 
lighting using MSI’s Mystic Light Sync software.
ASUS Launches ROG Strix GD30
The Republic Of Gamers now has a Strix-branded desktop. 
The ROG Strix GD30 is a barebones system that can be 
customized with components that match a user’s budget. 
The system also can be customized on the outside, as the 
case has multiple pieces in a black-and-white color scheme 
that can be arranged to present up to half a dozen different 
chassis configurations. The front and top panels can be 
combined in a way that brings to mind a storm trooper 
from Star Wars, and ROG is quick to point out that the 
GD30 makes a great system for fans of the movie. There’s a 
windowed side panel for viewing components, but instead 
of a solid-glass side, the GD30 window has a “honeycomb” 
metal pattern that includes the ASUS logo. ROG says the 
panel reduces electromagnetic interference. The system 
comes with Windows 10 and ASUS AEGIS III software.

Software Vulnerabilities Up, 
Patch Rates Down, Study Shows
Although the number of software vulnerabilities reached record 
levels last year—17,147 vulnerabilities in 2,136 products from 
246 vendors—patch rates were down, according to the newest 
annual report from Secunia Research at Flexera Software. The 
50 most popular products recorded 1,626 vulnerabilities, a 
15% increase in the five-year trend. Despite those figures, the 
survey did have some good news: among the top 50 products, 
81% of all vulnerabilities and 92.5% of applications impacted 
by vulnerabilities had patches available on the day the problems 
were disclosed. The number of zero-day exploits (22) was also 
down compared to 2015. Microsoft applications account 
for more than 70% of the 50 most popular applications on 
private PCs but only 22.5% of vulnerabilities (9% of those 
were in Windows 7). Web browsers were among some of the 
most-exploited programs, with the five most popular browsers 
accounting for 713 vulnerabilities, up 27.5% from 2015.
Research Could Lead To Better 
Artificial Intelligence Systems 
A new computational model being developed at Northwestern 
University could overcome one obstacle to artificial intelligence—
being able to see and understand the world as humans do. Human 
intelligence is characterized by the ability to solve complex visual 
problems, the Northwestern University researchers note, so 
developing artificial intelligence systems that can do that could 
shrink the gap between computer and human cognition. The 
system was developed by Ken Forbus, a Northwestern University 
professor, and Andrew Lovett, a former postdoctoral researcher 
at the university. It’s based on an AI platform called CogSketch, 
which can solve visual problems and understand sketches to 
give immediate, interactive feedback. The researchers tested their 
system against Raven’s Progressive Matrices. “The model performs 
in the 75th percentile for American adults, making it better than 
average,” Forbus said. “The problems that are hard for people are 
also hard for the model.”
SOFTWARE SHORTS
against high-resolution images trying to make a match, while a 
prior network adds realistic high-resolution details to make the 
output more realistic, the researchers explain. The result wasn’t an 
exact image, because the system uses “hallucinating” techniques 
to create the final image’s sharp details, but the images on average 
look photo-realistic, according to the researchers. (The image at 
left shows the test photo in the first column, 
the system-created image in the second column, 
and the “ground truth” image in the third). 
Researchers presented study participants with 
a series of two images (the true image and the 
new system’s “corresponding prediction”) and 
they were asked to say which image was from 
a camera. Test participants were fooled about 
10% of the time (a 50% score would have 
shown the system perfectly confused subjects). 
Google Software Can Fill In 
Missing Pixels In Photos 
Researchers at Google Brain are working on a tool that can 
fill in the missing pieces—or at least reasonable facsimiles 
of them—in low-resolution or grainy images. The research 
could bring about dramatic improvements 
in areas such as investigative work, where 
high-resolution photos of criminals aren’t 
always available but could make the 
difference in whether a case gets solved.
The tool works based on a system of prior 
knowledge. In testing the system, for example, 
the researchers used low-resolution images 
of faces. The software used a conditioning 
network to map the low-resolution photo

Poll: Most Americans Not Concerned 
About Online Tax-Related ID Theft 
Despite reports of tax-related identity theft reaching 
monumental numbers last year—787,000 confirmed reports 
totaling more than $4.4 billion—most Americans aren’t 
worried about tax fraud, according to a survey by CyberScout. 
In fact, 58% of Americans aren’t worried about tax fraud at all. 
CyberScout surveyed 1,500 United States consumers and found 
that most Americans are also fairly lax about the security of their 
tax forms. Just 35% of taxpayers demand their tax preparers 
use two- factor authentication, the survey notes. Only 18% use 
an encrypted USB drive to save important tax documents and 
worksheets, and 38% store those documents on a computer 
hard drive or in the cloud, which CyberScout points out are 
susceptible to a variety of attacks. The 57% of Americans 
who are late tax filers (those who wait 
until March, April, or later) are more 
susceptible to tax fraud because fraudsters 
have additional time to impersonate 
them, according to CyberScout. 
In addition to filing early, the company 
recommends taxpayers use long and 
strong passwords, use direct deposit or 
a locking mailbox if you’re receiving a 
refund, and monitor and protect your 
accounts and personal identity online 
and in social media.
Always-Online, Connected Lifestyles 
Impact Families, Study Shows
Kids are spending more time on digital devices. Although that 
finding, part of the 2017 Connected Family Survey conducted by 
Intel Security, isn’t anything new, what might surprise some is the 
impact our digital, always-online lifestyles are having on families. The 
introduction of smartphones and tablets has brought about a change 
in bedtime habits. More than 75% of parents let their children 
bring an internet-connected device to bed, and 32% of parents have 
argued with their child about bringing a device to bed. Many parents 
monitor how much time children spend in front of a screen, with 
20% allowing three to four hours a day and 48% allowing one to 
two hours. All that screen time comes with concerns. About 80% of 
adults are worried their children could interact with a cyber predator 
or criminal online, and 34% have discovered their child visited an 
inappropriate website. But it’s not just kids guilty of using devices 
when they shouldn’t: About 36% of parents said their child has 
called them out for being on their device during family time.
SITE SEEING
note that the new technique can be used as part of stronger 
multifactor user authentication even across browsers or to help 
improve existing privacy-preserving works. 
Their proposed technique will look at OS- and hardware-level 
features such as those from graphics cards, CPUs, the audio stack, 
and installed writing scripts, the researchers note. To test the 
technique, the researchers enlisted the 
help of users from two crowdsourcing 
websites who were asked to visit a website 
using two different browsers of their 
choosing. The researchers collected data 
from more than 1,900 users and were 
able to correctly identify 83.24% of users, 
which is a more than 14% improvement 
compared to previous cross-browser 
fingerprinting techniques. 
New Technique Identifies Users 
Across Browsers
It’s a well-known fact that what we do online can be tracked by 
any number of sites, often with good intentions of improving 
customer service or, in the case of banking or financial 
institutions, keeping us more secure. Fingerprinting is one of 
the most common techniques. It works 
regardless of whether you have cookies 
enabled, but existing methods are 
typically limited to a single user and one 
browser. A technique being developed by 
a team of researchers at Lehigh University 
and Washington University in St. Louis, 
though, is considered the first cross-
browser fingerprinting to use OS- and 
hardware-level features. The researchers

Job Of The Month
The reports are all over the news: Robots will soon be coming to take our jobs, and millions of positions 
are at risk. Well, as they say, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. Boston Dynamics is known for making 
some of the most technologically impressive (and terrifying looking) robots that exist, including running 
“dog” robots and humanoid robots that go walking in the woods (just do a quick search online for the 
videos). The company has an opening for a software perception engineer to “give our robots the ability 
to navigate through forests and across mountains.” Applicants must be wise in the ways of robotics 
algorithms and data structures and be experienced Linux users who can write up a coding storm with 
C++. It also helps to know some Python and be comfortable debugging hardware. This position is at the 
company’s offices in Waltham, Massachusetts. One more note: If you do land a spot with the company, 
please remember to build a secretive off button into our new robot overlords.

Mobile Warriors Shoppers: 
Millennials vs. GenX
Generation X is the name for the generation 
following the Boomers. GenXers are now about 36 
to 50 years old. Millennials are the generation born 
toward the end of the 20th Century; they are now 
between 18 and 35 years old. The research firm 
Newzoo examined how the two groups compare 
when it comes to online shopping and making 
payments at retail. Overall, millennials shop more 
online. Newzoo says 37% of millennials spend 
three or more hours shopping online each week, compared with 27% of Generation X. When mobile 
digital payment technology is available at retailers, 50% of millennials would prefer to use it to pay for 
their purchases, while only 41% of GenX shoppers would choose that option over more mainstream 
payment methods such as credit/debit cards or bank transfers.

The Digital Divide, AKA Show Me The Money
A study by Pew Research shows that . . . surprise! . . . households with more money tend to have 
greater access to new technologies and technology products. The study asked people what types 
of digital devices (smartphones, desktops/laptops, tablets) they owned and whether they had 
broadband access at home, and then it broke down the results by household income. As you might 
imagine, in every category of 
product/technology, there was 
a clear correlation between 
HHI (household income) and 
access. While two-thirds 
of people with HHI above 
$100K had access to all the 
technologies mentioned, only 
17% of people with HHI 
lower than $30K could make 
that claim.

Now Boarding For 
Kaby Lake 
We Review Four Z270 Motherboards
The Z270 chipset supports both 
Intel’s Kaby Lake desktop CPUs, such 
as the Core i7-7770K, and Skylake 
processors, such as the Core i7-6700K. 
With Kaby Lake, Intel provides the 
usual selection of Core i7/i5/i3 chips, 
headlined by the unlocked Core i7-
7700K and Core i5-7600K. Our test 
bed features the Core i7-7700K. This 
quad-core processor boasts Hyper-
Threading to handle eight concurrent 
threads—identical to the Core i7-
6700K. The Core i7-7700K is faster 
than its Skylake counterpart with a 
4.2GHz core clock, up 200MHz from 
the Core i7-6700K, and a 4.5GHz 
Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency.
Our test system also features GIGA-
BYTE’s GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme 
Gaming, 32GB of Corsair Vengeance 
LED DDR4-3200MHz memory, and a 
480GB Patriot Hellfire SSD. To prevent 
the CPU from throttling under load, 
we used Alphacool’s Eiswand 360 CPU, 
a huge external AIO liquid cooling 
tower. The whole system is powered by 
an EVGA SuperNOVA 850 T2, an 80 
PLUS Titanium-certified PSU.
As we mentioned, this roundup 
features premium Z270 motherboards 
with high-end models from AORUS, 
EVGA, MSI, and Supermicro. There’s 
a little something for everyone, 
whether you’re looking for a platform 
for overclocking, multi-GPU gaming, 
or luxurious looks. 
Supermicro C7Z270-PG
Since the introduction of Intel’s Ivy 
Bridge processor family and the Z77 
chipset, mainstream Intel processors 
3 connectivity. Almost all of the Z270 
motherboards we’ve tested to date 
feature two or more USB 3.1 ports, 
and manufacturers usually include one 
reversible Type-C port. Many high-end 
motherboards, such as the models in 
this roundup, feature multiple M.2 
and U.2 ports. 
Also, the Z270 chipset has a 
potential ace up its sleeve in the form 
of native support for Intel Optane, 
which is a new storage and memory 
technology based on 3D XPoint 
memory media. Intel recently launched 
its first Optane SSD, the DC P4800X, 
an enterprise add-in card SSD. When 
available for consumers, Intel Optane 
devices are expected function as both 
high-speed storage and custom virtual 
memory. Intel Optane performance is 
likely to be slower than conventional 
DRAM, but faster than traditional 
SSDs. In particular, Intel Optane 
should be good for random workloads 
at low queue depths, where the 
majority of real-world activity occurs. 
A
MD’s Ryzen processors and new 
chipsets might have taken some 
of the luster off of Intel’s Kaby Lake 
CPUs and the Z270 chipset, but 
there are still plenty of reasons to 
go Team Blue with your next build. 
High-speed storage enthusiasts, for 
example, can build a RAID array 
with multiple PCIe, NVMe SSDs—
each running over a PCIe 3.0 x4 bus. 
By comparison, Ryzen and the X370 
chipset only provide one PCIe 3.0 x4 
bus. Motherboard makers also support 
much faster DDR4 modules with 
Intel’s Z270 chipset (typically up to 
4,000MHz) than AMD’s X370 chipset, 
which often top out at 3,200MHz.
Another good reason to consider 
the Z270 chipset is the platform’s 
relative maturity. Unlike the limited 
selection of Ryzen motherboards on 
the market—with most manufacturers 
only offering three or four boards—
most all motherboard companies 
provide a complete lineup of Z270 
motherboards. Many high-end Z270 
motherboards with the latest amenities 
retail for around $300 and go up to 
$500, while more basic boards start 
around $125. In short, there’s a Z270 
board for most any budget.
If you’re trying to decide between 
Z270 and the older Z170 platform, 
you should consider a few factors, 
including internal and external 
device connectivity. Intel provides 
24 PCIe 3.0 chipset lanes on Z270, 
up from 20 PCIe 3.0 lanes on Z170. 
The extra lanes give motherboard 
manufacturers quite a bit of flexibility 
for M.2, U.2, USB, and Thunderbolt

2Gbps, or you can connect to two 
private networks at one time. The dual 
Ethernet ports are located on the rear 
panel next to four USB 3.1 ports (one 
Type-C and 3 Type-A) and two USB 
3.0 ports. Needless to say, the rear I/O 
connectivity has a power user flavor. 
Like all Supermicro motherboards 
we’ve seen, the C7Z270-PG features 
the company’s “server DNA” with 
materials qualified by Supermicro’s 
server standards. Of note, Supero 
motherboards are validated with full-
load server testing methods, which 
include pushing the board at 100% 
load for 150 hours. Despite the 
excellent power-handling hardware, 
the C7Z270-PG doesn’t have as many 
overclocking conveniences the other 
boards in our roundup. The basics 
are covered—with a debug LED and 
onboard power, reset, and clear CMOS 
buttons—but there are no voltage read 
points or a BIOS switch, for instance. 
Supermicro updated the BIOS 
interface from its Z170 motherboards, 
and while it looks better, there’s a 
lot of scrolling involved to reach the 
overclocking settings. Once you’ve 
located the OC options, the process 
is fairly intuitive, but it’d be nice if 
the key adjustments, such as the clock 
ratio multiplier, were near the top of 
the settings.
In the past, Supermicro’s mother-
boards haven’t always matched up well 
with the competition in the onboard 
audio department. The C7Z270-PG 
boasts the upgrades gamers demand 
with Japanese ELNA audio capacitors 
and a TI OPA1612 operational 
amplifier that can output hi-fidelity 
sound. Supermicro also adds shielding 
to the audio path to protect from noise 
and distortion.
With the four PCIe x16 slots 
and two M.2 slots, the expansion 
portion of the PCB is fairly tight. 
The location of the bottom PCIe x16 
slot—just above the USB headers 
on the bottom of board—means any 
GPU in the bottom slot will need 
to be a single slot card, unless you 
with PCIe SSDs using either the two 
M.2 slots (both offer support for type 
2260/2280/22110 devices) or the two 
U.2 ports. You could also create a RAID 
1 configuration for data mirroring. If 
you plan to mix and match M.2 and 
U.2 storage, keep in mind that the top 
U.2 port will be disabled if you plug an 
M.2 device into the bottom M.2 slot. 
For conventional SATA storage, there 
are six 6Gbps SATA ports that support 
RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10. 
Keeping with the multiplex 
theme, the C7Z270-PG comes with 
two Ethernet ports powered by Intel 
i219V and i210AT NICs. The two 
LAN ports can work together via 
teaming to deliver bandwidth up to 
have come with an integrated graphics 
controller that provides 16 PCIe 3.0 
lanes. With a single GPU and most 
2-way SLI or CrossFire configurations, 
16 lanes is enough bandwidth to do 
the job. Things look less rosy with a 
3-way or 4-way GPU setup—unless 
the motherboard, like Supermicro’s 
C7Z270-PG, boasts Broadcom’s 
PEX8747 chip that ups the PCIe 
graphics lane count to 32. With the 
extra lanes, the C7Z270-PG runs 2-way 
setups at x16/x16, 3-way at x8/x8/x8, 
and 4-way configs at x8/x8/x8/x8.
 Extreme graphics are just the start 
of what you can accomplish with 
the C7Z270-PG. You can build an 
incredibly fast RAID 0 configuration

MSI to provide plenty of space around 
the board’s voltage check point and 
upper fan headers.
MSI knows that overclocking 
conveniences aren’t much use if the 
motherboard’s power-handling parts 
are weak. The Z270 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM is built 
with MSI’s premium Militar y 
Class components, 16-phase digital 
power delivery, and an extra power 
connectors for the CPU socket and 
graphics card slots. For CPU power, 
the board includes both 8-pin and 
4-pin connectors, while the PEG slots 
can supplement power via a 6-pin 
PCIe connector. Another handy GPU 
addition is the PCI CeaseFire switch 
CPU overclock or PCIe SSDs in RAID 
0, this board has the tools you’ll need.
The XPOWER GAMING TITA-
NIUM includes a bunch of goodies 
to simplify the tuning and tweaking 
process. Our favorite addition is the 
OC Dashboard. This daughterboard 
connects via an extension cable for 
real-time, push-button control of CPU 
settings, such as CPU ratio and BCLK. 
The OC Dashboard also features 
Power, Reset, Complete Discharge 
(reset BIOS while PC is off ), and 
GO2BIOS (enter BIOS after reboot) 
buttons to quickly start afresh. Besides 
the convenience of not having to 
reach inside the case, shifting the OC 
buttons to the daughterboard allows 
have extra space below the expansion 
slots in your case. A red LED runs 
along the audio section of the PCB, 
but otherwise, there’s almost no other 
LED illumination on the board. We’d 
have preferred to have some way to 
shut off the red LED, as this option is 
commonly available on other boards 
we’ve reviewed. Some builders might 
not want any LED light, while the 
red color may clash with your build’s 
color scheme.
Our test system configuration didn’t 
take advantage of the motherboard’s 
exceptional 3-way and 4-way SLI and 
CrossFire support, but that didn’t stop 
the board from posting the best overall 
frame rates in our game tests. The 
frame rates were only a frame or two 
higher than the competition, but the 
C7Z270-PG did produce the best, or 
tie for the best, with 107fps in Metro: 
Last Light, 119fps in Dying Light, and 
86fps in Witcher 3. On the whole, 
other benchmarks results were solid.
Motherboards with the Broadcom 
PEX8747 chip typically don’t come 
cheap—with some retailing for $500. 
Supermicro manages to include the 
multi-GPU support with an MSRP 
of $339, an impressive feat. A few 
more overclocking conveniences, 
both onboard and in the BIOS, 
would have been nice, but solid, 
speedy connectivity for PCIe SSDs 
and NIC teaming still make this 
a very intriguing option for perfor-
mance enthusiasts.
MSI Z270 
XPOWER GAMING TITIANUM
MSI designs much of its mother-
board lineup to suit gamers with 
high-end enhancements that improve 
onboard audio and networking, 
as well as peripheral connectivity. 
The Z270 XPOWER GAMING

gaming additions, plus a wide array of 
tools to optimize overclocks, as well 
as storage and GPU performance. If 
you’re contemplating an extreme

3.0 headers. If, for some reason, you 
need more internal USB 2.0 headers, 
MSI also provides a USB Xpander 
daughterboard (and an expander cable) 
to turn a single header into four USB 
2.0 headers. 
MSI’s TITANIUM edition mother-
boards have a distinct look with 
a lustrous silver PCB, heatsinks, 
and rear I/O cover. The Z270X 
GAMING TITANIUM also includes 
an RGB LED header to let you 
control the LED colors with 5050 
RGB LED strips. MSI Mystic Light 
is also compatible with a variety of 
other products, including some cases, 
memory, mice, and keyboards, so you 
can sync internal and external lighting.
In our benchmark testing, the Z270 
XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM did 
exceptionally well in SiSoftware Sandra’s 
processor tests with top numbers in all 
the Processor Arithmetic and Processor 
Multi-Media tests. The board also 
posted near top results in Cinebench 
15 (974 points) and POV-Ray 3.7 
(2096.85 pixels per second). Last but 
certainly not least, the XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM produced the 
top overall score in 3DMark’s Fire 
Strike Extreme, boosted by a Physics 
score of 14524.
MSI provides a lot of gadgets 
for overclockers with the Z270 
XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM, 
and enthusiasts will find few Z270 
boards as well as equipped for real-
time OC control. We also like the 
impressive storage amenities, as well as 
the sheer number and variety of USB 
connections. As you might expect, 
there’s a bit of added cost with the OC 
and connectivity extras, but the board’s 
$329.99 retail price is not out of line 
with what MSI delivers. 
EVGA Z270 Classified K
EVGA’s motherboard family is as 
consistent, from chipset to chipset, as 
there is. The lineup almost always has 
three models: the Stinger or Micro (a 
small form factor board), the FTW (a 
feature-filled board with additions for 
available, though some will become 
unavailable when you connect a PCIe 
SSD. The user’s manual provides a 
detailed chart that shows what ports 
will be unavailable with all possible 
storage combinations. 
We can’t imagine many people, even 
power users, who will use all the USB 
connections on the Z270 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM. The rear panel 
alone has two USB 3.1 ports (one 
Type-A, one Type-C), four USB 3.0, 
and three USB 2.0. One of the USB 
2.0 ports serves as a BIOS Flashback 
port when the PC is unbootable or if 
you don’t want to connect a CPU or 
memory. For front panel connectivity, 
there are two USB 2.0 and two USB 
to enable or disable the PCIe slots, 
which lets you troubleshoot a problem 
without physically removing the GPU.
Storage support on the Z270 
XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM 
is outstanding; there are three M.2 
slots that support both PCIe and 
SATA SSDs at speeds up to 32Gbps. 
MSI includes an M.2 Genie feature 
in the BIOS to easily create a RAID 
configuration with your PCIe SSDs. 
To help you get the most speed from 
a single M.2 drive, you can install the 
included M.2 Shield, which MSI says 
helps to prevent thermal throttling. 
There’s also an U.2 port, if you want 
to connect a 2.5-inch Intel SSD 750 
Series drive. Eight 6Gbps ports are

Z270 CLASSIFIED K
$299.99    |   EVGA    |    www.evga.com
CPU  /  April2017 15

Benchmark results for the EVGA 
Classified K were, for the most part, 
consistent with the field. SiSoftware 
Sandra’s Memory Bandwidth tests were 
the notable exceptions, as the Z270 
Classified K was the only board to 
deliver better than 36GBps in both 
memory-intensive tests. The EVGA 
Classified K also posted the best 
frame rate (23.09fps) in the 3DMark 
Fire Strike Extreme Combined 
Test, which stresses both the system 
CPU and GPU.
The Z270 Classified K is an 
excellent platform for overclocking 
your Skylake or Kaby Lake processor, 
and the $299.99 price tag is a bit more 
affordable than MSI’s Z270 XPOWER 
GAMING TITANIUM. EVGA does 
make a questionable choice of wiring 
the bottom PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for x1 
speed. The design might handcuff 
add-in cards, such as some PCIe SSD 
options that require four lanes of PCIe 
3.0 bandwidth, but this might not be a 
problem if you only plan to use M.2 or 
U.2 ports for high-speed storage. 
AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 7
The GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 is the 
most affordable motherboard in this 
roundup, but device support, onboard 
connectivity, and visual aesthetics 
are generally on par or better than 
the competition. You can create a 
RAID array, for example, with three 
PCIe, NVMe SSDs. A triple-NVMe 
configuration can include PCIe SSDs 
in the two M.2 slots and the U. 2 port 
or one M.2, one U.2, and one PCIe 
add-in card. Want high-speed memory? 
You can install modules running at 
4,133MHz. GIGABYTE also provides 
an abundance of RGB LEDs, which 
can be split into multiple zones, for 
gorgeous, custom illumination.
AORUS motherboards have only 
been around since January, and 
thus far, prodigious customization 
has been one of the more defining 
characteristics of GIGABYTE’s 
premium gaming brand. Take the 
onboard audio, for example. The 
bandwidth with the U.2 slot. Unlike 
some other boards, you’ll need to 
manually disable or enable the ports 
in the BIOS, rather than having one 
automatically shut off if the other 
shared port is populated. On our test 
unit, we had to enable the top M.2 
slot, as the U.2 port was enabled by 
default in the BIOS.
In addition to the two Key M 
(110mm and 80mm) M.2 slots, EVGA 
provides a Key-E (32mm) M.2 slot 
that you can use for a Wi-Fi module, 
or other Key E M.2 device. Wired 
network connectivity is provided by 
two NICs—the Killer E2500 and 
Intel’s i219V. The two wired Ethernet 
ports don’t support teaming, but if you 
add a Killer Wireless AC 1535 or 1525 
wireless module, it will work with the  
E2500 to enable Killer’s DoubleShot 
technology, which prioritizes network 
traffic and sends latency-sensitive 
gaming and voice traffic over 
whichever interface is currently faster.
The Z270 Classified has the most 
robust rear-panel connectivity of the 
boards in our roundup, including a 
full-fledged Thunderbolt 3 port and 
a USB 3.1 Type-C port. Typically, 
motherboards only have one or the 
other, and it’s nice to see both on the 
rear panel. EVGA also includes a USB 
3.1 Type-A port and four USB 3.0 
ports. An additional four USB 3.0 ports 
and two USB 2.0 ports are available via 
internal headers. 
The Z270 Classified K is an EATX 
motherboard, while the other boards 
in this roundup are the traditional 
ATX form factor. In addition to the 
larger form factor, EVGA opts for 90 
degree connectors for many of the 
internal headers, such as the 24-pin 
main power and USB 3.0 headers. The 
design makes for a clean look, as it’s 
easier to hide the trailing cables, but 
might cause an issue if there’s limited 
space around your motherboard. In 
our test system, for example, there’s 
a PSU shroud that sits directly below 
board and made it difficult the case’s 
front panel USB 3.0 connector. 
gamers), and the Classified (built with 
high-end features and overclocking 
goodies). The Z270 Classified K 
continues EVGA’s engineering 
excellence with a 13-phase digital 
VRM with a CPU socket powered by 
two 8-pin EPS headers. Clean power 
to your CPU is just the start, as EVGA 
includes some of its tried-and-true 
overclocking favorites. EZ Voltage read 
points and Probe It connectors, for 
instance, let you easily attach and hold 
multimeter leads, and the E-LEET 
tuning suite is a great tweaking tool. 
The Z270 Classified K boasts 
some of the biggest VRM and PCH 
heatsinks we’ve seen, and EVGA 
runs a metal heat pipe between the 
giant heatsinks. EVGA says the heat 
pipes help to distribute heat among 
the onboard cooling. To simplify 
the overclocking process, there are 
onboard power, reset, and clear CMOS 
buttons, as well as a BIOS switch. 
Troubleshooting is easy, too, thanks 
to a series of onboard LEDs that 
indicate whether slots are active and 
operating correctly. 
As a big-name graphics card vendor, 
it only makes sense for EVGA to 
optimize the board’s GPU performance. 
The Z270 Classified K supports 
2-way SLI and 2-way CrossFire. On 
the bottom of the board, there’s also a 
6-pin PCIe power header that EVGA 
recommends you use with SLI or 
CrossFire configurations. The 6-pin 
connector augments the power provided 
by the 24-pin to improve stability. A 
third PCIe x16 slot is also available, 
but this slot is only wired for x1 speed. 
It’s a bit of an odd choice to electrically 
wire this slot for x1, as many Z270 
motherboards wire the slot at x4 
speed—allowing for support of add-in 
card PCIe SSDs. 
EVGA’s storage choices are similar 
to the other models in this roundup. 
There are two M.2 slots (1 type 
2242/2260/2280/22110 and one 
type 2242/2260/2280), a U.2 port, 
eight 6Gbps ports, and two SATA 
Express ports. The top M.2 slot shares

other boards in this roundup, the rear 
panel offers two Ethernet ports; one is 
powered by Intel’s i219V and the other 
is driven by Killer’s E2500. The latter 
pairs with the Killer Control Center to 
prioritize bandwidth to games and apps.
With top marks in 3DMark’s Fire 
Strike Extreme test, PCMark 8’s Creative 
test, Cinebench 15, and POV-Ray 3.7, 
the AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming was a 
definite winner in our benchmark tests. 
Storage speed with Patriot’s 480GB 
HellFire were scorching, too, with a 
2,778MBps Sequential Read (Q32T1) 
and 797.3MBps 4K Read (Q32T1) in 
CrystalDiskMark. 
It might not have quite as extensive 
a lineup of OC bells and whistles as the 
an SLI or CrossFire setup room to 
breathe. The bottom PCIe x16 slot 
is electrically wired for x4 speed and 
shares bandwidth with the bottom 
M.2 slot. This slot operates at x2 
speed if you install an M.2 SSD in the 
bottom M.2 slot.
We already mentioned the extensive 
RAID options for high-speed storage, 
and GIGABYTE supplements the PCIe 
SSD connectivity with six 6Gbps SATA 
ports, which double as three SATA 
Express ports. For external storage and 
general connectivity, the rear panel 
offers a Thunderbolt 3 port, a USB 3.1 
Type-A port, and five USB 3.0 ports. 
The Thunderbolt 3 port can also serve 
as a USB 3.1 Type-C port. Similar to 
GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 comes with 
Creative’s Sound Core3D quad-core 
audio processor, as well as Creative’s 
SBX Pro Studio suite that lets you 
tailor sound quality to your personal 
preference. A lot of motherboard 
makers would stop there, but 
GIGABYTE also adds its AMP-UP 
technology where you adapt onboard 
sound quality by installing a different 
operational amplifier. The GA-Z270X-
Gaming 7 includes a switch to adjust 
gain for 600-ohm headphones, too. 
Fan control is another area where 
the GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 excels. 
AORUS provides eight hybrid fan/
water pump headers that support 
both PWM and voltage modes. The 
mainboard will automatically detect 
what type of device is connected and 
supply the appropriate power. You 
can tweak header power modes and 
create custom fan curves for each 
header. Two of the headers support 
up to 24-watt liquid-cooling pumps. 
For accurate temperature readings, 
AORUS includes seven temperature 
sensors and two headers for external 
temperature sensors. You can configure 
which sensors the fan headers monitor 
for optimal cooling and noise.
The AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 
is designed to handle potent overclocks 
with a 12-phase VRM. To make 
overclocking easier, the mainboard 
includes clear CMOS, power, and 
reset buttons, as well as voltage 
measurement points and GIGABYTE’s 
UEFI DualBIOS. GIGABYTE has 
also worked with EKWB to create 
an optional monoblock, which cools 
both the CPU and MOSFETs—an 
interesting option for anyone going the 
custom loop route. 
The expansion slot layout is similar 
to previous AORUS and GIGABYTE 
Z270 motherboards we’ve seen. There 
are three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots with the 
top two slots able to run at x8/x8 when 
two GPUs are installed. The board 
provides two slots’ worth of space 
between the top and middle PCIe x16 
slots, a layout that gives the cards in

four PCIe 3.0 lanes for PCIe, NVMe 
SSDs. It’s a smart decision on AMD’s 
part, because you won’t have to worry 
about a PCIe SSD sharing bandwidth 
with I/O devices or expansion slots 
powered by the chipset. The X370 
chipset itself natively supports up to 
four SATA ports (in RAID 0, 1, and 10 
configurations) and two SATA Express 
ports. AMD also provides eight, general 
purpose PCIe 2.0 lanes that can be used 
for additional connectivity. Overall 
storage connectivity isn’t as robust as 
Intel’s Z270, but it will only affect those 
who want to set up a RAID with two or 
more PCIe SSDs.
The AORUS GA-AX370-Gaming 5 is 
an excellent example of how motherboard 
makers can utilize the Ryzen processor 
and X370 chipset to enhance overall 
storage connectivity. There’s an M.2 slot 
and U.2 slot for PCIe SSDs, but due to 
the limited PCIe 3.0 lanes for storage 
duties, the M.2 connector will be 
disabled if you populate the U.2 port. 
On the plus side, the M.2 slot supports 
type 2242/2260/2280/22110 M.2 form 
factors, as well as PCIe SSDs and SATA 
AMD is working with motherboard 
vendors to work out the kinks, and you 
can expect upcoming BIOS updates from 
all mainboard manufacturers to unlock 
faster speeds down the line.  In general, 
it’s wise to check the qualified vendors 
list to ensure motherboard compatibility, 
and it’s always a smart move when dealing 
with a brand new chipset. 
The X370 chipset, by default, supports 
2-way CrossFire and SLI graphics card 
configurations. Ryzen processors provide 
16 PCIe 3.0 lanes for graphics duties, 
so a CrossFire or SLI configuration will 
run at x8/x8 speeds, while a single GPU 
runs at x16 speed. Support for SLI on 
X370 is notable, as it’s not available on 
AMD’s B350 chipset. Many B350 chipset 
motherboards support CrossFire, but thus 
far, it looks like the second PCIe x16 slot is 
typically wired for x4 speed. The AORUS 
GA-AX370-Gaming 5 also allows for quad 
GPU configurations if you install a set of 
dual-GPU cards. Overall, multiple-GPU 
support on the X370 chipset is similar to 
what you’ll find in the Z270 chipset.
In addition to the 16 PCIe 3.0 GPU 
lanes, AMD Ryzen processors provide

verybody loves a comeback story. It’s 
been a long time since AMD was truly 
competitive in the enthusiast processor 
market, but AMD’s Ryzen CPUs look 
to be a triumphant return for Team Red. 
And while Ryzen processors play the role 
of returning hero, the X370 chipset is 
the hyper-competent sidekick that makes 
everything go. X370 brings AMD up to 
speed with the features and connectivity 
in line with Intel’s recent chipset. There 
are a few other new chipsets with Ryzen, 
including B350, A320, X300, and A300, 
but the X370 chipset is the one for 
enthusiasts. The AORUS GA-AX370-
Gaming 5 is one of the top motherboards 
for the X370 chipset.
It’s always easier to see where a 
motherboard maker has made tweaks 
if we know the stock chipset features. 
To start, Ryzen’s dual-channel memory 
controller and the X370 chipset bring 
AMD into the DDR4 era with stock 
speeds up to DDR4-2667. The AORUS 
GA-AX370-Gaming 5 ups DRAM 
frequencies to DDR4-3200, though 
we were instructed to run our HyperX 
Predator DDR4-3200 kit at 2933MHz.

additions for RGB lighting and fan 
controls should come as no surprise. The 
RGB Fusion LEDs, which include LEDs 
between the DIMMs, under the PCIe 
slots, and along the sides of the PCB, are 
just as dazzling with the X370 chipset 
as they were on Z270. There’s also an 
RGBW LED strip extension header to 
sync the RGB Fusion lighting with third-
party RGB LED kits. The Smart Fan 5 
headers will automatically detect the type 
of cooling device you’ve plugged in, and 
AORUS lets you customize fan speeds 
based on the nine different temperature 
sensors around the board. 
The benchmark numbers showcase 
what you can accomplish with the Ryzen 
7 1800X processor and a high-end X370 
motherboard. In POV-Ray 3.7, our test 
system produced 3288.48 pixels per 
second, while Cinebench 15 delivered 
a score of 1616. By comparison, the 
Core i7-7700K tested in an AORUS 
GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 produced marks 
of 2021.79 (POV-Ray 3.7) and 942 
(Cinebench 15). Results in our gaming 
tests, such as 89fps in the Witcher, and 
3DMark’s Fire Strike Extreme benchmark 
show no dropoff in GPU results, either. 
Geared for enthusiasts, Ryzen 
processors need a motherboard that 
will match the impressive CPU 
performance. AORUS gives power 
users all the connectivity they need to 
build a benchmark destroying system. 
We also like the onboard lighting and 
fan speed amenities, as it’s easy to create 
a system that runs quietly and looks 
stunning. Hopefully, BIOS updates will 
soon be available to improve memory 
compatibility for high-speed DDR4. ■

SSDs, so it’ll work with any M.2 storage. 
There are eight 6Gbps SATA ports with 
RAID functionality and the obligatory 
two SATA Express ports. 
Ryzen processors and the X370 chipset 
both provide native USB connectivity. 
The X370 chipset features 2 USB 3.1 
ports, six USB 3.0 ports, and six USB 
2.0 ports, while the Ryzen processor also 
chips in four USB 3.0 ports. AORUS 
ups the USB 3.1 count by installing 
an ASMedia USB 3.1 controller that 
provides one USB 3.1 Type-C port and 
one USB 3.1 Type-A port. There are more 
than enough USB ports to go around, 
even for peripheral-heavy power users.
To help you get the most out of 
Ryzen processors—all of which are 
overclockable—AORUS uses a 6+4 phase 
power delivery design hosted by 4th 
generation IR (International Rectifier) 
digital power controllers with 3rd

sense current and distribute thermal loads 
to prevent overheating, which should 
improve overclocking capability. You can

that, two of the most active cores are 
capable of jumping to 4GHz. For users 
who install high quality aftermarket CPU 
coolers that can handle the extra thermal 
capacity, AMD’s Extended Frequency 
Range (XFR) technology kicks in to give 
those two cores another 
100MHz to play with in 
short bursts. 
For the new architecture, 
AMD’s initial goal was to 
improve IPC (instructions 
per clock) by 40% com-
pared to Bulldozer, but 
AMD’s engineers managed 
a better-than-expected 
52% improvement. To keep 
this powerful processor

an 8MB block of L3 cache 
shared between all cores. 
into what SenseMI is all about in the 
White Paper in this issue, but for the sake

or the last decade, every Intel processor 
review used the previous generation 
Intel processor as the primary point 
of reference, because AMD couldn’t 
compete. With Ryzen, all of that 
changes. The Ryzen 7 1800X isn’t the 
second coming of the Athlon 64, 
but it’s a massive pivot-and-leap in 
the right direction. 
Codenamed Summit Ridge, 
the Ryzen 7 flagship features a 
192mm2 die consisting of 4.8 billion 
transistors. It is manufactured on 
Global Foundry’s 14nm FinFET 
process and features eight cores with 
SMT (simultaneous multi-threading) 
enabled, letting each core tackle 
two threads at once, for a total of 
16 threads when the processor is 
running flat-out. 
Its core clock is set to 3.6GHz, 
and it relies on a collection of 
SenseMI (the MI stands for Machine 
Intelligence) technologies that enable 
a Precision Boost frequency of up 
to 4GHz. We’ll dig much deeper 
AMD’s new Ryzen is the company’s first platform in several years to offer 
serious competition at the high end for Intel’s Core processors. The initial 
rollout for Ryzen includes three processors, the 1800X, 1700X, and 1700, 
that AMD has priced very aggressively in relation to Intel’s products.

you can see from the scores, the 4.1GHz 
overclock (across all cores) can make a 
substantial difference in applications. 
The Ryzen 7 1800X is a disruptive 
product, and as such, it’s hard to find 
a direct competitor from Intel. The 
significantly less expensive $350 Core i7-
7700K has half as many cores and slightly 
better single-core 
performance, but 
the Intel Core 
i7-5960X costs 
more than twice 
as much, and

is also the speed we tested at). Most 
AM4 X370 motherboards support 
memory frequencies up to 3,200MHz, 
and a simple BIOS update is all 
that’s required. 
All of the Ryzen processors will 
have unlocked multipliers, which gives

Ti makes up for the specs deficit with 
higher core clocks (1,480MHz base, 
1,582MHz Boost) and a higher memory 
clock (11,000MHz effective), which work 
out to 11.4TFLOPS of peak compute 
and 484GBps memory bandwidth 
for a 0.4TFLOP and 4GBps memory 
bandwidth edge compared to the TITAN 
X. When compared to the very capable 
GTX 1080, the new card is 35% faster. 
The blower-style cooler attached to

is nearly identical to the one on 
NVIDIA’s in-house GTX 1080. The 
card is slightly longer at 11-inches from 
the bracket to the opposite end near 
the power ports, and 4.4-inches from 
the PCIe interface to the green LED-lit 
GeForce GTX logo. Its width matches 
that of the bracket, so users with tight 
enclosures can breathe a sigh of relief. 
The shroud on this card is composed 
of a handful of interlocking triangular 
black and silver die cast aluminum parts 
adorned with a pattern of various sized 
Ti is faster than the TITAN X, but sells 
for the GTX 1080 Founders Edition’s 
initial price of $699. As a result, the GTX 
1080 is getting a price cut to $499.
The GPU in this card has everything 
that makes Pascal one of the best 
architectures to ever come out of Santa 
Clara, only more of it. There are 28 
Streaming Multiprocessors, 3,584 
CUDA Cores, 224 texture units, and 
88 ROPs. There’s a 352-bit memory bus 
connected to 11GB of Micron’s uber-
fast GDDR5X. The TITAN X has a 
wider 384-bit memory bus, 12GB of 
GDDR5X and 96 ROPs. The GTX 1080

amers following the graphics card tit 
for tat between NVIDIA and AMD 
for the last few years have enjoyed the 
fruits of this intense competition, yielding 
technologies like SLI and CrossFireX, 
G-SYNC and FreeSync, HairWorks 
and TressFX, PhysX, Eyefinity, the 
Mantle API (now the Vulkan API), 
Async Compute, Simultaneous Multi-
projection, HBM, VR, and countless 
more. All of which have in one way or 
another, made games look and play better. 
The latest salvo from NVIDIA comes in 
the form of the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 
a preemptive strike designed to deflate 
AMD’s upcoming Vega launch and secure 
the performance crown.
To craft this card, NVIDIA took the 
12 billion transistor GP102 manufactured 
on TSMC’s 16nm FinFET process –the 
same GPU used in the jaw-droppingly

also unavailable on the B250 chipset. 
With these caveats in mind, the B250M 
MORTAR ARCTIC is still a capable 
platform for a full-fledged gaming PC, 
especially considering MSI’s hardware and 
software additions.
MSI equips the B250M MORTAR 
ARCTIC with its collection of Audio 
Boost hardware for studio-grade sound 
quality. Like many gaming motherboards, 
MSI physically isolates the audio 
components and circuitry from the 
rest of the hardware for a clean path. 
Chemi-Con audio capacitors handle both 
the rear and front audio outputs and help 
to produce rich, deep tones. Realtek’s 
ALC892 processes onboard audio and can 
deliver up to 7.1 surround sound.
To provide the most bandwidth to 
users while gaming, the motherboard 
comes with Intel’s i219V LAN port and 
MSI’s GAMING LAN MANAGER 
utility. The latter allows you to prioritize 
network bandwidth to your PC’s games 
and applications. By default, the software 
will detect your games and automatically 
memory. The board is compatible with 
ultra-fast M.2 storage devices, thanks to 
a 32Gbps Turbo M.2 slot that supports 
type 2242/2260/2280/22110 form 
factors. There are also six 6Gbps SATA 
ports, as well as support for Intel Optane 
hardware. The connectivity is close to 
what you’ll find on entry-level Z270 
motherboards, but MSI only retails the 
B250M MORTAR ARCTIC for $89.99. 
There are some things the B250 
chipset won’t support. Overclocking with 
unlocked CPUs, for example, is out, as 
is support for memory operating faster 
than DDR4-2400. The 2400MHz 
memory speed is only possible with a 
7th Generation Intel processor, and 6th 
Generation chips limit you to DDR4-
2133. SLI and RAID configurations are 
I
n the last few years, we’ve seen a distinct 
change in the approach motherboard 
makers take regarding the “B” variant, 
such as B150 or B250, of Intel’s 
mainstream chipsets. Rather than rely 
on the traditional set of business class 
features, some “B” chipset motherboards 
now include gaming features, such as 
high-fidelity onboard audio and a wired 
NIC that optimizes network bandwidth. 
Gaming motherboards based on the B150 
chipset offered good value (most options 
retail for less than $100), but B150 
boards were notably handcuffed by the 
chipsets meager eight PCIe 3.0 lanes. On 
the B250 chipset, Intel adds four more 
PCIe 3.0 lanes that support Intel’s Rapid 
Storage Technology, which paves the way 
for more PCIe SSD options. 
MSI’s B250M MORTAR ARCTIC 
is an mATX motherboard that makes 
near perfect use of what’s available on the 
B250 chipset. There are two PCIe x16 
slots, which support CrossFire at x16/
x4 speed, and four DIMM slots where 
you can install up to 64GB of system

ports. Comparably priced B250 boards 
feature nearly identical rear panel 
connectivity. MSI also provides an 
X-Boost utility that, according to the 
company, can boost USB performance 
by up to 20%. 
As part of MSI’s Arsenal lineup, the 
B250M MORTAR ARCTIC gets the 
camouflage treatment, and being an 
ARCTIC model, the PCB blends white 
and silver elements throughout the PCB, 
heatsinks, and slots. It’s a good visual 
backdrop inside a system, though we’d 
prefer if MSI switched out the black 
PCIe x1 slots, SATA ports, and power 
connectors with white or silver accents to 
complete the look.
We tested the B250M MORTAR 
ARCTIC with the high-end collection 
of parts we use for Z270 chipset 
motherboards, including a Core i7-
7700K, GIGABYTE’s GeForce GTX 
1080 Xtreme Gaming, 32GB of 
Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-3200 
(clocked at 2400MHz), and a 480GB 
Patriot Hellfire. Overall numbers were 
comparable to the high-end Z270 boards 
we’ve tested, highlighted by a 3DMark 
Fire Strike Extreme score of 10071 and a 
POV-Ray 3.7 mark of 2092.25 pixels per 
second.
Small motherboard form factors, such 
as mATX and Mini-ITX, are an excellent 
fit for the B250 chipset, as the PCB 
confines already limit expansion slots and 
extra power handling for overclocking 
enhancements. As you can see from our 
benchmarks, you can make a potent 
gaming PC with the B250M MORTAR 
ARCTIC. And with the cash saved, you 
can devote some extra budget to other 
parts of your PC.  ■

give them priority over other applications. 
You can customize bandwidth to each 
program on your PC, should you wish. 
The Intel i219V LAN port is also shielded 
against power surges by MSI’s LAN 
PROTECT technology.
MSI includes a couple of software 
utilities that are helpful to the gaming 
experience. The Gaming Hotkey utility, 
for instance, allows you to set up macros, 
assign commands, and create profiles 
to customize the functionality of any 
keyboard. To customize your mouse, 
MSI also includes a Mouse Master 
utility where you adjust mouse DPI 
and program macros to mouse buttons. 
To take advantage of the mouse and 
keyboard upgrades, just connect your 
gaming peripherals to the GAMING 
Device ports (1 PS/2, two USB 2.0) at 
the top of the rear I/O panel.
Speaking of the rear I/O, USB 
connectivity on the B250M MORTAR 
ARCTIC isn’t quite as robust as you’ll 
find on a Z270 motherboard, but that’s 
a function of the B250 chipset, more 
than a failure on MSI’s part. The B250M 
MORTAR ARCTIC boasts three USB 
3.0 Type-A ports and one USB 3.0 
Type-C port, as well as two USB 2.0

overcurrent, overvoltage, undervoltage, 
overpower, overtemperature, and short-
circuit conditions.
be quiet! designs the Pure Power 
10 600W CM to support multi-GPU 
gaming rigs. The two +12V rails support a 
maximum current of 48A for a combined 
power of 576 watts. That’s 96% of the 
PSU’s maximum continuous power. In 
terms of power distribution, the 32A +12V 
rail handles the 20+4-pin main power, 
connected drives, and two of the PCIe 
6+2-pin connectors. The 28A rail powers 
the 4+4-pin CPU power connector and 
a second set of PCIe 6+2-pin connectors. 
The unit’s +3.3V rail can handle up to 25A 
and the +5V rail supports 18A. 
Similar to previous Pure Power models 
we’ve reviewed, the Pure Power 10 600W 
is semi-modular, but only the 20+4-pin 
and 4+4-pin connectors are hardwired. In 
any modern build, of course, you’ll need 
both of the hardwired connectors. The 
remaining connections are provided via 
flat black ribbon cables. In total, the Pure 
Power 10 600W offers four PCIe 6+2-pin 
connectors, six SATA, three Molex, and 
one FDD connector. Some comparably 
priced PSUs offer more SATA and Molex

e quiet! has a diverse power supply 
lineup. There are two high-end series, 
the Dark Power Pro and Straight Power, as 
well as several lineups for price conscious 
builders, such as the Pure Power series 
we examine here. The German company 
recently announced Pure Power 10 
models, available in either modular 
or hardwired cabling, that boast several 
internal improvements while retaining the 
same low cost of the previous generation. 
New DC-to-DC power conversion 
technology, for example, allows Pure 
Power 10 PSUs to deliver tighter voltage 
regulation under heavy loads for better 
overall stability. The affordable PSU is also 
up to 89.5% efficient and meets the 80 
PLUS Silver certification. 
The Pure Power 10 600W CM (short 
for cable management) is one of the 
modular options in the new lineup, which 
also includes 700W CM, 500W CM, 
and 400W CM versions. Despite being 
geared toward budget builders, the Pure 
Power 10 600W CM doesn’t skimp on 
dependability features. be quiet! improves 
reliability by including both active clamp 
and synchronous rectifier technology, 
which reduces switching losses and boosts 
efficiency. There are two +12V rails (one 
connectors, but the Pure Power 10 
600W’s connectivity should be enough 
for the majority of builds.
As with any be quiet! PSU, the unit 
comes with the company’s Silent Wings 
fan. The 120mm temperature controlled 
fan is rated for only 20.3dB(A) when 
the PSU is under full load, and at 50% 
load, noise levels drop to 12.5dB(A). In 
our testing, the Pure Power 10 600W 
CM was never audible over the other 
components in our case. We were able 
to push the power supply to a maximum 
wattage of 355 with a power factor 
of .971 by simultaneously running 
Prime95’s In-Place test and Unigine 
Heaven 4.0. Power factor, under load, was 
typically between .960 and .985.
Affordable cost might be the most 
compelling reason to purchase the Pure 
Power 10 600W CM, yet the PSU’s 
internal switching hardware also makes 
reliability part of the value proposition. A 
couple more SATA and Molex connectors 
would be nice, but barring a large RAID 
array or multiple Molex powered fans, the 
connectivity shouldn’t be a problem.  ■

Rosewill EX-700 Hybrid 2-Way In-Ear Headphones
deliver lossless 24-bit/192k audio; reach 
40kHz; and output trebles, mids, and 
lows that work together but stand apart. 
(A new EX-500 model also uses a hybrid 
driver, although it combines a 10mm 
dynamic unit with a ceramic tweeter.) 
Aiding all this is usage of OFC (oxygen 
free copper), a gold-plated 3.5mm plug, 
and patented “SpinFit” ear tips. The latter 
are designed to sit deeper in the ear canal 
to better isolate noise and thus enhance 
treble. The effect was noticeable but 
only slightly so for me. Rosewill bundles 
three sets of these ear tips along with two 
standard sets.  
While all these touches are appreciated, 
ultimately the proof is in the pudding. 
To that end, the EX-700 outputs some 
fine-tasting pudding. Most satisfying 
was the extent to which mids were 
present in music listening. Rather than 
emphasizing lows or highs and thus 
muddying the mids, the EX-700 presents 
a cleanliness and preciseness across the 
audio spectrum that’s wonderful. In Steely 
I
f a company wanted to make a splash 
with its first entry in what’s already a 
packed pool of high-end earbuds, it could 
do worse than take the path Rosewill 
did with its new EX-700. Rosewill 
opted to do something unique. With 
the EX-700, this translates to using 
a driver that’s not only uncommon in 
this price range, but also highly effective, 
including at widening the so-called audio 
soundstage. Whereas many earbuds’ 
one-driver approach effectively mashes 
instruments and vocals together to dull 
their individual personalities, the EX-
700’s hybrid driver creates ample space 
for instruments to breathe with clarity. 
Combine this with a handsomely rugged 
exterior and tantalizing price and the 
Hi-Res Audio logo-bearing EX-700 is a 
solid match for discerning listeners. 
For the EX-700, Rosewill combined an 
8mm dynamic driver designed to tackle 
the low end with a balanced armature 
driver that does the same for mids and 
highs. Together, Rosewill says the unit can 
Dan’s “Gaucho,” which has tons going on 
musically below the surface, the EX-700 
enabled keyboards, backing vocals, horns, 
chimes, and more to ripple and flow. 
In Massive Attack’s “Teardrop,” which 
starts with a crisp, isolated beat before 
layers of additional sounds gradually join 
in, the earbuds ably captured the track’s 
simmering intensity. Succinctly, any mid-
priced earbuds that can create the sense 
of being in the room as The Beach Boys 
harmonize on “God Only Knows” is 
worth strong consideration. 
Elsewhere, the EX-700’s gunmetal-gray 
aluminum-alloy housing looks stealthy 
cool but should take a good beating over 
time. Also fetching is the twisted-wire 
cord that’s wrapped in a transparent 
protective layer. Looks and durability 
aside, though, the EX-700’s best feature 
is the top-notch audio it delivers for its 
price, which sits at $49.99 online. ■

Zalman ZM-K900M White Edition
not only the space beneath and around the 
key, but also lights up the letter or number 
etched into each keycap, and when you plug 
it in for the first time right out of the box, a 
rainbow of colored light flows continually 
across the keyboard from left to right. You 
can customize the backlight in many ways, 
setting the full keyboard backlight to run one 
of 13 preset effects or selecting only specific 
keys to light up. You can even have your 
selected keys light up in a specific order, and 
you can of course also control the brightness 
of the LED backlight. And that’s not all: The 
ZM-K900M’s backlight can even respond to 
your keystrokes if you want it to.
In addition, Zalman equipped the 
keyboard with 10 preset game profiles that 
light up selected keys for several game genres 
(FPS, MMO, MOBA, RTS) and several 
specific games, including Counter-Strike, 
DOTA 2, StarCraft 2, and others.
We should also point out that there’s 
more to this keyboard than pretty lights. It’s 
a full 104-key QWERTY model with 10-
key numpad and media control keys, and 
Zalman offers it with Kailh Blue or Brown 
mechanical keyswitches. Our review unit 
came with the Brown switches, which provide

t’s pretty easy to see with a glance around 
your favorite PC parts retailer and/or any 
LAN party you go to that these days, LED 
lighting is king. Putting LEDs on computer 
parts and peripherals isn’t a new thing, of 
course, as it’s been going on for many years, 
but starting in late 2015 and into 2016, 
component and peripheral companies really 
began shifting LED inclusion into high 
gear. You’ll find LEDs on every component 
of some builds these days, and several 
motherboard manufacturers have begun to 
include control systems for tying all those 
lights together under one control interface.
White PC components are also quite 
popular, and Zalman has seemingly 
accounted for both of these factors in 
designing its ZM-K900M White Edition 
mechanical gaming keyboard. Let’s just 
get this out of the way: The ZM-K900M 
White Edition is hands-down the brightest, 
most colorful keyboard we’ve ever seen. 
Depending on how your tastes run, that 
could be an asset or a liability, but for those 
who like their PC parts shiny and bright, 
this one’s right up your alley.
Zalman designed the ZM-K900M with 
per-key RGB backlighting, which illuminates 
tactile feedback but aren’t clicky, so we liked 
them and so did our nearby colleagues. The 
ZM-K900M is part of Zalman’s Z-Machine 
Gaming Gear line, and its Z-Engine system 
gives the board a high 1,000MHz polling rate, 
which according to Zalman results in a 1ms 
response time.
Other features that help make it a legit 
gaming keyboard include Z Key mode, 
which disables the Windows key, full support 
for macros, N-key rollover, a five-way routing 
guide groove along the bottom of the board 
that helps keep the cable out of your way, 
non-slip rubber pads and adjustable feet for 
elevating the back end, and a Step Sculpture 
2 profile that helps make it comfortable to 
use for long stretches.
We put the Zalman ZM-K900M White 
Edition through its paces with several 
hours of FPS and MMO gaming, and it 
performed admirably. It’s comfortable, 
responsive, and as mentioned earlier, it’s 
very bright and very colorful. If you’re 
contemplating an all-white gaming build 
and you want maximum LED presence, this 
is the keyboard for you, full stop. ■

Patriot Viper V361 & V370 7.1 Virtual Surround Headsets
braided cord. Further, both headsets’ 
hard-rubberized exterior, steel headband 
frame, and metal-mesh earcup grilles 
create a foundation that’s durable without 
compromising comfort. 
Elsewhere, both headsets integrate 
LED lighting around the Viper logos, 
though the V361 is limited to red 
while the V370 offers full RGB range 
and several customization options. 
Additionally, both headsets forego the 
V360’s onboard LED switch in favor of 
control via downloadable software. The 
lighting itself is soft but attractive. Other 
than differences in software versions for 
each headset, it’s the LED abilities that 
primarily differentiate them. Otherwise, 
both headsets use closed-back designs that 
admirably block environmental noise; 
omit an inline controller; and pack a 
40mm neodymium magnet main driver 
and 30mm sub-driver in each earcup. 
That latter driver fuels Patriot’s 
wonderful UBR function, which adds 
low-end pizzazz and heightened ambiance 
M
ake or break, that’s what first 
impressions can do. If so, Patriot 
was hardly left broken after debuting its 
first Viper gaming peripherals in 2015. 
If anything, the inaugural Viper products 
quickly positioned Patriot as a contender 
in the space. The V360 gaming headset 
belonged to that lineup, and while Patriot 
still sells it ($39.99), the V361 and V370 
(and V330 stereo model) recently joined 
the Viper ranks.  
Like the V360, the V361 and V370 
are 7.1 virtual surround sound models, 
integrate a Volume dial and UBR (Ultra 
Bass Response) switch in the left earcup, 
and include an omnidirectional mic that 
folds inconspicuously into the headset. 
The new headsets distinguish themselves 
with a new housing that relocates the 
Viper logo to the earcups’ front-center 
and incorporates a wider adjustable 
headband. Identical-looking, the V361 
and V370 create a formidable presence 
with their matte-black finish and silver 
and red accents that extend to the 7-foot 
to nearly every listening experience. 
Further, pushing volume in bass-heavy 
tracks like The Beastie Boys’ “Funky Boss” 
didn’t introduce unacceptable distortion 
or losses in clarity. While the headsets’ 
discrete drivers and UBR function alone 
produce above-average audio, activating 
virtual sound added noticeable flavor 
and depth, including to engines roaring 
from all directions in “Mad Max: Fury 
Road” and horses hooves pounding in 
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
A minor complaint pertains to the 
headsets’ non-bendable mic boom, 
which leaves the mic a fair distance from 
the mouth. Those I communicated with 
reported OK clarity but noticed some 
surrounding noise creeping in. That said, 
both headsets shine considering their 
prices (particularly the V361) and keep 
Patriot on a stated path to create gaming 
peripherals that meet the same level of 
expectations buyers have for its memory. ■

were near 150fps or better. The liquid 
cooling keeps the GeForce GTX Titan’s 
heat in check, and we love the shiny 
nickel backplates. 
A Beautiful Sight 
NCIX PC makes a nice artistic 
choice with the cooling loop around 
the GPU. Both GPU waterblocks have 
parallel pass-throughs (hardline tubing 
connected to both the left and right 
sides, rather than one entrance and exit), 
but instead of routing the liquid out the 
bottom of the lower GPU, the coolant 
exits above the top GPU, and NCIX PC 
creates a rectangular section of hardline 
tubing that runs around the GPUs and 
down to the 1.2TB Intel 750 SSD. 
The top and bottom of this rectangular 
section are about the same 
height as the reservoir, 
which resides a few inches 
to the right. 
In addition to the hori-
zontal symmetry, many 
of the vertical sections of 
hardline tubing match 
up to form exceptionally 
clean lines. For example, 
the portion of the loop 
exiting the front radiator 
is an unusually long (30 inches) stretch

With a name like Avalanche, the 
bright white and cool blue colors 
inside the system are the perfect 
theme. NCIX PC complements the 
colors with a hand-frosted piece

the purposeful jagged cuts look like 
mountain peaks. The exterior and 
radiators are painted white with a 
glittery finish that draws the eye. A lot 
of boutique builders can create a wow

FrostByte
the result was his and Christianson’s Witcher mod, and he’s 
back at it again with this project.
FrostByte took Hansz about two months to complete, 
working mostly on the weekends. “I vacuum-formed the 
basic shapes of the dragon,” Hansz says. “This saved on 
material and cut down on the weight of the case. I riveted 
the forms to the case and built off of them using more 
styrene and Magic-Sculpt sculpting clay. After finishing all 
the detail sculpting and sanding, I began the tedious task 
of painting each scale. I used a combination of airbrush 
and hand painting, and I painted each scale four times to 
blend them.
“I mounted the head on the case and ripped the vented 
front open, making it look like the dragon was tearing 
through the case. I built the eyes out of frosted acrylic and 
sculpted them into the face. Then I backlit them to make 
them glow, and added black vinyl slits.”
Hansz also built all of the cables from scratch and hand-
sleeved them, lacing the bundles together with clear fishing 
line. He added blue and white vinyl pieces throughout 
the interior to continue the external color scheme, built a 
custom plaque out of the system’s hard drive, hand-bent all 
of the tubing for FrostByte’s cooling system, and gave the 
case a gunmetal paint job with a clear-coat finish.
J
on “PennyWise” Hansz first appeared in “Mad Reader 
Mod” in our May 2012 issue, when his EpiDemic mod 
won our mod contest at PDXLAN 19, and then he won 
again one year later at PDXLAN 21 with his Triton mod. 
In a weird sort of symmetry, he won the mod contest again 
along with Ron Lee Christianson (with their excellent The 
Witcher mod) and appeared in our April 2016 issue, and has 
won once more (also a year later) at PDXLAN 29 with this 
month’s Mad Reader Mod: FrostByte.
This incredible mod obviously gets its name from the frost 
dragon sculpted onto the front, top, and right-side panels. 
“I have been wanting to do a dragon build for quite some 
time,” Hansz tells us. “I drew all my inspiration for this 
build from my two daughters, Odessa and Olivia. They don’t 
know it yet, but this build is for them. I was really impressed 
with how well they have improved in school this year and 
how they are taking pride in their grades.”
Taming A Dragon
Hansz’s technical skills as a modder have been well 
demonstrated; he’s an electrician, and his profession has 
clearly contributed to his skill in working with his projects’ 
wiring and such. But Hansz says he just began sculpting 
again last year for the first time since art class in high school; 
CPU  /  April2017 37

Additionally, Hansz said he built a makeshift paint booth 
in his garage for this project using plastic sheeting, a box fan, 
and a kids’ crawl tunnel that he repurposed into ducting to 
vent the paint fumes outside.
Teeth & Fangs
FrostByte began as a Thermaltake Core X71 case. Hansz added 
an Intel Core i7-6700K processor, an ASUS ROG MAXIMUS 
VIII FORMULA motherboard, 16GB of Avexir Raiden DDR4 
memory, a pair of ASUS STRIX GeForce GTX 1070s in SLI, a 
Thermaltake Toughpower DPS G RGB 1250W power supply, a 
V-Color 120GB M.2 SSD, and a 2TB Seagate hard drive.
His cooling subsystem consists entirely of Thermaltake 
parts, including Riing fans, tubing, fittings, RGB fittings, 
coolant, waterblocks, radiators, and reservoir/pump combos. 
(The MAXIMUS FORMULA also includes built in EKWB 
CrossChill EK MOSFET cooling.)
He’ll Be Back
Hansz says he built six mods in 2016 alone, so it should 
come as a surprise to no one that he will be starting another 
project shortly. “I haven’t started on a personal build yet, but 
I will have something in the works very soon,” he says.
We’d say he’s earned a (short) breather. ■

Nobody has more modding cred than Dennis “DeadGuy” Leach. One of the co-founders and owners of the legendary 
case and cooling shop Danger Den, Leach has been making PCs faster, cooler, and better-looking since 2000. After 
moving on from his first venture, he helped his son Bren and friends start Moonlight Mods, a company with a killer 
lineup of steel and acrylic cases in all shapes and sizes. Leach won the first CPU mod contest at PDXLAN back in 
2007 and has appeared twice in CPU’s “Mad Reader Mod” feature. He’s been involved with a number of other major 
modding contests and is still a fixture at PDXLAN in Portland.
Modder Q&A: Dennis Leach
Life Before & After Danger Den
would know it was watercooled. 
When people saw how fast your 
overclock was, they couldn’t figure 
out how you did it until you 
opened the hood.
Q
: How are you involved with 
Moonlight Mods now, and 
are any of the other Danger Den 
guys part of that?
DL
: Me and Dan still hang out 
all the time, but Moonlight 
Mods is my son’s and myself 
(family owned). The boys love 
building custom cases. 
Q
: The second time you were 
in “Mad Reader Mod” was 
with your Bench Racer rig, 
which featured ASUS’ Rampage 
III Extreme motherboard. How 
did you find building a mod 
based on a piece of hardware 
rather than starting from a 
concept of your own?
DL
: That one gave me nightmares. 
I blame Brian Jang, who 
worked for ASUS at the time (he’s 
now with NVIDIA). I was building a 
custom case for ASUS at the time for 
PDXLAN, so they could show off the 
Rampage III. Brian mentioned they 
had the expander card for it, but it 
Q
: What was your first mod, and how 
did you get started modding PCs?
DL
: If you remember back in the 
old days of watercooling, we 
used to use heater cores for radiators 
and you would usually hang them off 
the back of the case. I started modding 
cases so I could hide the heater cores 
on the inside of the case so no one 
Q
: The first time we bumped 
into your work was PDXLAN 
back in 2007 when your Overkill 
mod won the first mod contest 
we ever held at PDX. How many 
PDXLANs have you been to now, 
and when did you start going?
DL
: I started going at PDXLAN3. 
I have only missed one 
event in 2013.
Q
: Do you still have Overkill, by 
the way?
DL
: That is the one I wish I 
had kept, but I didn’t. I 
usually just end up giving away all 
my project cases when I am done 
with them. My goal is to build 
the perfect case; I have yet to 
get there. But there is always the 
next one.
Q
: So Danger Den got started 
around 2000, right? How 
long were you into building and 
modding before you and the guys got 
DD going?
DL
: We started watercooling our 
own rigs about 1998. I would 
stay after work and use the machining 
equipment to build waterblocks for Dan, 
Jeremy, and myself.
40 April2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

DL
: ASRock X99E-ITX, Intel 5960X, 
Sapphire RX480, prototype case.
Q
: Of all the projects you’ve worked 
on over the years, which would you 
say is your favorite, and why?
DL
: My favorite case is always 
the next one I will build. I’ve 
always been trying to build the perfect 
case, and someday I’ll do it. It is all 
about the building.
Q
: Your son Bren won “Mad Reader 
Mod” once, as well, in 2009. Have 
you guys worked on mods together, 
and—more importantly—did you 
teach him everything he knows?
DL
: We work together all the time, 
last year at PDXLAN we were 
in the charity mod contest together and 
we’ve ever seen that included a real, 
live bonsai tree! Have you done any 
projects since then that work in 
such an unusual element as a tiny, 
living tree?
DL
: That one was actually a really 
fun one, I had to take someone 
else’s idea for a case, and then build 
it. The case was part CNC-machined 
and part wood. It was meant to be 
a media player for me, but it had to 
pass the wife test to be in the living 
room. Which is why Bill Owen won 
. . . my wife wasn’t one of the contest 
judges. My friend Scott Schuff from 
thoselightsigns.com still has it in his 
living room. His wife wasn’t one of the 
judges, either.
Q
: What rig did you game on at the 
most recent PDX event, PDXLAN 29? 
was only for bench racing, not meant 
to be in a case. Like the dummy, I 
am, I said I could build one! That was 
only 13 days before the LAN. Only 
problem was, there were no working 
cards in the U.S. There was a dead 
one I could look at, but that was it. 
The day before PDXLAN started, I 
got a box from ASUS with all the 
working parts. I showed up at the 
LAN with the computer with no OS 
installed and no drivers. With help 
from the ASUS and NVIDIA people 
we got the correct drivers installed 
and it fired up.
Q
: We also got to see some of 
your work during the NVIDIA 
ION Case Mod Contest, held in 
conjunction with NVIDIA and 
Modders-Inc.com. Your entry, ION 
Bonsai, was definitely the first mod 
Leach’s first Mad Reader Mod winner, Overkill, graced the cover of the May 
2007 issue of CPU after it won our mod contest at PDXLAN.
Here’s Leach’s Bench Racer, his second MRM-winning effort, minus its 
super-cool red front panel.

we built a case called Wolf-moon. Our 
case didn’t win the contest, but it raised 
the most money for the charity and won 
the popular vote. We were happy with it. 
And he is more creatively talented than I 
am. (Don’t tell him I said that.)
Q
: What’s your favorite part of every 
mod project, and what’s your least 
favorite? Why?
DL
: The best part is when I’m start-
ing the build, and my least 
favorite part is when it’s over and I must 
clean up.  It’s all about the designing and 
building for me.
Q
: What do you think of the state of 
modding these days?
DL
: Modding is alive and doing 
well, at least in this part of the 
country. Going to PDXLAN all the 
time has spoiled me. The number of 
modded computers there is amazing. 
The competition is always tough, 
the best modders in the country will 
show up here. 
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions!
1) Core or Ryzen? 
Core, but I really want to give Ryzen 
a try.
2) Coke or Pepsi? 
Coke.
3) Ducks or Seahawks? 
That’s easy, Oregon State. Go Beavs!
4) Custom-painted PSU or power 
supply shroud?
Shroud.
5) Counter-Strike: GO or Overwatch?
Infinite Warfare, dedicated to my [KH] 
clan, it’s all we play. ■
ION Bonsai was Leach’s entry in the 2009 NVIDIA ION Case Mod Contest; it strikes a rare balance between 
technology and nature, to the point where it looks right at home even in an ornate Japanese garden.

San Antonio’s SAN LAN Spring 2017
Counter-Strike For Cash, Prizes 
& A Good Cause
Way back in July 24th, 2003, gamers in the San Antonio area banded together and set up their own Counter-Strike: Global 
Offensive event, aptly named SAN LAN. Over the years, SAN LAN has hosted events ranging in size from 30 to 200 attendees, 
and it has been on hiatus for a while, but Harold Bratcher, its lead organizer, says that now it’s back for good. “In early 2016 I 
came across a reddit post where people were talking about our old LAN parties and expressing regret that there’s not a similar 
event taking place in San Antonio anymore,” Bratcher says. “It all became clear to me: I needed to bring SAN LAN back in full 
force.” The return of SAN LAN took place last year on August 27th.
The latest SAN LAN event was held on Saturday, 
March 11 from 8 a.m. to midnight at Norris 
Conference Centers, and was a traditional 5v5 
round-robin CS:GO tournament for a maximum of 
10 teams. The entry fee was $50, and spectators 
could come and watch the action for $10. Bratcher 
says they filled all their tournament seats and had 
about 25 spectators; teams competed for $2,000 
in cash prizes, as well as a raffle for cool gaming 
prizes from SAN LAN sponsors, including a state-
of-the-art chair from Arozzi, gaming headsets from 
Arctic, and Gunnar Phantom MLG gaming eyewear.
CPU  /  April2017 43

SAN LAN Spring 2017 was also a benefit event for Animal Defense League of Texas; players and spectators could bring toys, blankets, food, and other pet-
related items to benefit the orphaned cats and dogs the League cares for while they wait for new homes. Donating any of the items from the ADL wish list 
gave attendees extra entries for the prize raffle.
“We have two pets that we adore, a cat and a dog we adopted from the shelter,” Bratcher says. “Most of the gamers who attend SAN LAN have pets of their 
own and love animals, so my wife Ruxandra, who manages SAN LAN’s PR and marketing, thought that partnering up with the Animal Defense League of Texas 
would be a great idea. And she wasn’t wrong. The SAN LAN family was very receptive to this charity.”
The Summer 2017 SAN LAN event will be a 
two-day event, and will include additional 
activities, including a CPU Case Mod Contest, 
so if you dig CS:GO and you’re in the area, stay 
tuned to sanlan.org for more information as it 
becomes available!
SAN LAN has also held benefits for Toys For Tots, and has another 
cause in mind for the next event. “We think that veterans, military 
families, and deployed troops deserve so much more,” Bratcher says. 
“So for our next event, we are working toward partnering up with a 
non-profit that helps America’s heroes.”

AMD Ryzen 
After A Long Wait, Enthusiasts Get Another Option
mainstream platform where up to 50% 
of the processor’s die was dedicated to 
an eSports-grade graphics adapter that’s 
rendered redundant when the user installs 
a discrete graphics card. And gamers are 
defined by the fact that they typically 
install a discrete graphics card. 
During this period, AMD was 
always there in Intel’s big blue shadow, 
offering less powerful parts on platforms 
that were consistently one or two years 
behind in features and manufacturing 
processes. This remained the status quo 
as AMD launched the lackluster K10 and 
Bulldozer series processors in 2007 and 
2011. In mid-2013, Intel launched the 
84-watt Haswell Core i7-4770K, which 
was fast, overclockable, and highly power 
efficient. AMD’s last real stab at the 
enthusiast market came in the form of 
a battle-axe, the FX-9590, which is an 
eight-core monstrosity with a 4.7GHz 
base clock and a 220-watt TDP. As Intel 
moved to Skylake, and more recently 
Kaby Lake, AMD didn’t even have a 
platform that supported DDR4 memory, 
and AM3+ motherboards that support 
NVMe and USB3.1 were few and far 
B
y now, you’ve probably read our 
Ryzen 7 1800X review, and likely 
a few others to boot. AMD has 
come a long way since the glory days of 
the K8 series processors, and although 
the Ryzen 7 isn’t exactly the equivalent 
of Rocky Balboa standing over Apollo 
Creed as the bell dings at the end of the 
fifteenth round, it is decidedly disruptive, 
and Intel’s definitely been put on notice. 
AMD’s got its groove back and that’s 
fantastic news for computing enthusiasts.
Some Perspective
Prior to March 2nd, 2017 and for 
the decade leading up to the launch 
of AMD’s Ryzen 7 processors, Intel 
dominated the enthusiast CPU landscape. 
The company’s long standing performance 
lead gave the firm near-complete control 
over prices, PC technology adoption, 
and market segmentation. As such, 
enthusiasts and gamers looking for the 
best performing processors needed to 
choose between two platforms, Intel’s 
pricey one where processors with more 
than four cores and quad-channel 
memory resided, or the more affordable 
between. With DDR4 recently achieving 
price parity with DDR3, AMD was 
well and truly left without a competing 
platform and processor yet again.
Compared to those processors, Ryzen 
7 doesn’t represent a dramatic shift in 
AMD’s marketing strategy. For about as 
long as AMD’s processors have lagged 
behind Intel’s, AMD has pitted more 
discrete cores against Intel’s two- and 
four-core processors with and without 
SMT (simultaneous multithreading), 
AKA Hyper-Threading. Although AMD’s 
FX Series processors and A Series APUs 
had plenty of resources at their disposal, 
they had to rely on high frequencies to

groundwork for the Bulldozer chips that 
failed to result in compelling processors 
for enthusiasts. Shortly thereafter, Lisa 
Su came on board as AMD’s SVP and 
General Manager in January of 2012. 
In 2012, together with AMD’s SVP and 
CTO, Mark Papermaster, Su oversaw 
the rehiring of Jim Keller as Corporate 
Vice President and Chief Architect 
for CPU Cores. Keller, a veteran from 
AMD’s K7 and the lead architect behind 
the K8 architectures, is largely credited 
with co-authoring the design of the 
Hypertransport bus specification, and 
while at Apple, for the design of the A4 
and A5 processors used in the iPhone 4/4S 
and iPad and iPad 2. Although Keller left 
AMD before the Ryzen 7 processors saw 
the light of day, most attribute the success 
of the new architecture to his designs and 
leadership. Less than three years after Su 
came onboard, Read left AMD and Su 
stepped in as President and CEO. 
Zen’s Blank Slate
In 2012, AMD had several goals 
for their new architecture, including a 
complete from-the-ground-up redesign of 
even come close to Intel’s chips, and 
Global Foundries’ processes were not 
tuned to deliver chips that could support 
such high clocks. Furthermore, most 
software, even through 2015, was still 
woefully single-threaded, which put the 
spotlight on single-core performance 
and played to Intel’s particular strengths. 
What is different this time is all down to 
the Ryzen 7 architecture, which closes the 
IPC (instructions per cycle, the number 
of operations the CPU can perform 
within each clock cycle) gap with its rival’s 
products. 
The Right People, & Not A Moment 
Too Soon
In the world of x86 semiconductor 
design, it takes a considerable amount 
of time to scrap an architecture and start 
from scratch. That’s why Intel’s been 
iterating on the Core architecture for 
seven generations and more than a decade, 
and it’s also why doing so at AMD called 
for no small about of house cleaning. 
Rory Read was appointed President and 
CEO in August, 2011 to replace Dirk 
Meyer, who was instrumental in laying the 
the cores, a high-bandwidth low-latency 
cache system, use of the energy-efficient 
FinFET manufacturing process, and a 
2016 availability. Importantly, Bulldozer’s 
CMT (cluster multithreading); which 
forces multiple cores to share L1, fetch, 
decode, dispatch, and FPU; was being 
dumped in favor of SMT (simultaneous 
multithreading), which dedicates more 
resources to each core, similar to the 
design of Intel’s processors. As progress 
continued on the design, more platform 
goals solidified, including high core counts 
and no onboard GPU for the enthusiast 
processors, as well as a new AM4 socket 
and support for DDR4 memory. 
In May 2015, Zen’s roadmap had 
slipped to 2017, but AMD had put 
out the claim that, largely thanks to the 
successful implementation of SMT, the 
new chips would be capable of 40% 
more IPC than its previous line of FX 
processors. To put that in perspective 
a little, consider a 7% IPC gain seems 
typical between two generations of a 
semiconductor using the same (or nearly 
the same) architecture. Compared to 
the Piledriver-based processors, AMD’s 
Steamroller processors, exemplified by the 
quad-core A10-7850K APUs, enjoyed a 
better than 9% single-threaded and 18% 
multi-threaded IPC improvement. When 
we first heard that AMD’s engineering 
team was targeting 40% IPC, which put 
them within striking distance of Intel’s 
Haswell and Broadwell chips, we were 
cautiously optimistic. 
As Zen began to take shape over its 
four-year gestation period, over 2 
million engineering man-hours were 
spent working on it. The processors 
were eventually renamed Ryzen, and 
the first processors to bear that slightly 
silly-sounding new name would be built 
for enthusiasts. These initial Ryzen 7 
processors would be designed to take on 
Intel’s Core-i7, just as the Ryzen 5s set to 
launch in April would go toe-to-toe with 
the Core i5s. You could look at the Ryzen 
numbering scheme as yet another example 
of AMD falling in line behind Intel, but 
now that we’ve seen for ourselves what 
Ryzen is capable of, it comes off more 
AMD CEO Lisa Su played a big role in driving AMD to create the Zen architecture and ultimately the 
Ryzen processors.

onboard graphics), T (low power desktop), 
S (low power with desktop graphics), H 
(high performance mobile), U (standard 
mobile), and M (low power mobile). So 
when you see “Ryzen 7 1800X” in the 
headline of a review in CPU, you know 
we’re talking about the best of the first 
generation top-end AMD processors, with 
XFR enabled (more on what XFR is all 
about later).
Ryzen 7’s Insides
The small modular cores of excavator 
and previous AMD architectures were not 
a good fit for gamers and enthusiasts, but 
AMD’s Zen architecture shows that AMD 
knew exactly how to make up the ground 
they’d lost since the mid-2000s. 
Although the architecture has the most 
the most impact on how efficiently and 
effectively a given processor runs, the 
manufacturing process plays a pivotal role. 
This first generation of Ryzen processors 
is built on a density-optimized version of 
Global Foundries’ 14nm FinFET process. 
The last FX processor we took a look 
at, the FX-8370, was manufactured at 
a comparatively ancient 32nm process. 
AMD’s engineers used several techniques 
to ensure that Zen would be a very power 
efficient platform, including enabling 
aggressive clock gating with multi-level 
regions, creating a large micro-op cache 
as an unblinking face-to-face 
challenge. 
At the Ryzen 7 Tech Day, 
Lisa Su revealed that her team 
of chip designers had managed 
to exceed their IPC goal, to 
the tune of 52% improvement 
compared to Excavator. The 
new processors would be led 
onto the battlefield by the 
eight-core sixteen-thread Ryzen 
7 1800X with a 3.6GHz base 
clock and a 4GHz boost clock. 
The Ryzen 1700X would 
be identical to the flagship, 
but with a 3.4GHz base and 
3.8GHz boost clock. These two 
would have a 95-watt TDP, but 
the third processor in the Ryzen 
lineup is the Ryzen 7 1700, a 
cooler 65-watt TDP processor 
that relies on a 3GHz base and 3.7GHz 
boost clock. Prices for the new processors 
are $499 for the flagship, $399 for the 
middle-tier unit, and $329 for the least 
expensive model. If the Ryzen 7’s early 
performance numbers were enough to get 
Intel to take notice, then these prices were 
an old fashioned shot across the bow.
New Model, New Name
All processors under the Ryzen brand, 
from mainstream to the prosumer models, 
will utilize a single numbering scheme. 
As stated above, the first number refers 
to the target market; 7 for enthusiast 
processors, 5 for the high performance 
chips, and 3 for the mainstream parts. 
This is followed by a four digit number 
starting with the generation number, then 
a number ranging from 4 through 8 to 
indicate performance level within the 
segment, and followed up by a double-
digit model number. The first generation 
of Ryzen 7 and 5 processors we know 
about end with double zeros, but future 
speed bumps may bear a 50 or 20 in the 
spot of the model number. Lastly, there 
is the power suffix, for instance X, which 
indicates the presence of XFR (eXtended 
Frequency Range). Other power suffixes 
that’ll be attached to future processors 
include G (desktop processor with 
capable of limiting power-
sucking faraway fetches, and 
creating a stack engine that 
results in low power address 
generation into the dispatcher. 
The onboard memory 
controller is dual-channel, 
which puts the Ryzen 7 on par 
with Intel’s Z270 platform, but 
it’s half the bandwidth of the 
E Series Intel chips running 
on the X99 platform. Inside 
each Ryzen 7 processor is a 
pair of CCX (CPU Complex) 
units that consist of four cores, 
each capable of handling two 
threads, connected to 8MB of 
16-way L3 cache, made up of 
four slices. According to AMD, 
each core can access every 
cache with the same average 
latency. The 96KB of L1 cache dedicated 
to each core is split, with 2/3rds for 
instructions, and the remaining 1/3rd for 
data. The L2 cache is a 512KB block of 
8-way associative memory that is strictly 
inclusive of the instruction and data 
caches. The ever-important L2 cache has 
32-byte interfaces between it and the L1 
and L3 caches. 
The Ryzen 7 1800X, as well as the other 
two Ryzen 7 processors, features two CCX 
modules for a total of eight cores and 16 
threads. In addition to stacking the cores, 
AMD can also disable individual cores 
within the CCX, as is the case for the 
four- and six-core Ryzen 5 processors. It’s 
this flexibility that lets AMD use the Zen 
architecture for processors in the client, 
server, and HPC spaces. 
Each CCX in the Ryzen 7 relies on 
what AMD calls the Infinity Fabric, 
which comprises the interface and bus 
that lets the modules, cores, and caches 
communicate with one another and with 
system memory, I/O, and PCIe devices. 
AMD also leans on the Infinity Fabric 
to deliver sophisticated command and 
control capabilities such as the ability to 
read real-time core voltage, temperature, 
power draw, and clockspeed as well as 
make adjustments to all of the above on 
demand.
Although AMD’s higher-end Ryzen processors don’t ship with CPU coolers, 
there are several new Wraith coolers available.

to demand and thermal headroom. 
AMD’s scheme lets the processor adjust 
clockspeeds in 25MHz increments. XFR, 
available only on Ryzen processors with 
the X suffix, is an extra bit of speed that 
the processor can put on that scales to 
the user’s cooling solution. If you’re 
running a closed-loop liquid cooler, then 
the processor can look at the distance to 
junction thermal maximums to determine 
this, then adjust the speed accordingly 
when possible. If you’re working with 
liquid nitrogen, then the fully automated 
XFR process should conceivably kick in 
more often. 
AMD’s Neural Net Prediction and 
Smart Prefetch technologies refer to AI 
algorithms that the processor uses to 
analyze and learn application behavior 
in real-time. With this information, the 
All told, AMD’s new architecture 
was designed from the outset to address 
four key ideas, including improved 
instruction-level parallelism for vastly 
superior single-threaded performance, 
lower latency and faster caches and 
prefetcher engines and support for 
simultaneous multi-threading, granular 
active and idle power sensing and control 
mechanisms, and a modular multi-CCX 
design on an Infinity Fabric interconnect 
and interface that lets AMD scale to and 
integrate features ideal for virtually any 
segment and market it chooses to serve.
AMD SenseMI Technology
AMD recently described its SenseMI 
(Sense Machine Intelligence) as an 
umbrella of technologies that covers 
Pure Power, Precision Boost, Extended 
Frequency Range, Neural Net Prediction, 
and Smart Prefetch. 
The first three of those, Pure Power, 
Precision Boost, and XFR, all tap into a 
smart grid of interconnected sensors within 
each Ryzen processor capable of accurately 
reporting power and temperatures within 
1mA, 1mV, 1mW, and 1 degree Celsius up 
to a thousand times per second. With this 
data, the processor can dynamically adjust 
its performance and power attributes to 
meet the application demand at hand. 
Instead of simply copy-pasting the same 
power profile for every Ryzen processor, 
Pure Power lets each Ryzen processor tune 
its power consumption behavior to the 
silicon’s specific capabilities. Precision 
Boost functions similarly to Intel’s 
Turbo Boost, by raising or lowering 
the processor’s clockspeed in response 
Ryzen processor can preload instructions 
into cache, anticipate the location 
of future data calls, and determine the 
best route for data to travel through the 
processor to execute the task as quickly as 
possible, every time. 
Ryzen Memory Support
Whenever a new platform launches, 
memory support, particularly with respect 
to higher-speed DIMMS, is usually one 
of the last aspects to fall in line. Often, 
motherboard reviews get posted with 
memory running below spec because the 
BIOS update that adds support for the 
rated speed has yet to materialize as we 
go to press. In our Ryzen 7 1800X review, 
we were running a 3200MHz-rated kit of 
Corsair Vengeance LPX memory, but the 
system would only boot with the memory 
running at 2,667MTps. That’s also the 
upper limit for non-overclocked modules, 
according to AMD’s reviewers’ guide. 
Strangely, when we installed the Ryzen 7 
1700X, it ran the same kit at 2,933MTps, 
without a hitch.
AMD’s memory performance numbers 
are different depending on whether you’re 
using single- or dual-rank DIMMs. Rank 
refers to the series of DRAM chips that 
can be accessed at once over the same 
address and data buses, and there can be 
multiple ranks per module. Depending on 
A 52% increase in IPC (instructions per clock) is simply unheard of in a single processor generation.
Ryzen’s SenseMI technologies have a big impact on the processor’s moment-to-moment frequency and 
power characteristics.

processors, every last one of them, will 
have an unlocked multiplier. Although 
overclocking will be limited to the X370 
and B350 chipsets, there are plenty of 
practical reasons for an enthusiast to 
opt for one of those chipsets over the 
mainstream overclocking-restricted A320 
or small form factor A300. And there’s 
no shortage of affordable X370 and B350 
boards to boot. 
As we went to press, we only have 
experience running the Ryzen 7 1800X 
and the Ryzen 7 1700X, which we 
managed to overclock to 4.1GHz and 
4GHz, respectively. And those numbers 
are for all eight cores. The Ryzen Master 
Utility (available at www.amd.com/
en/technologies/ryzen-master), is a very 
competent little utility that serves as a 
Windows-based software front-end for 
overclocking your hardware. You can use 
it to tweak the multiplier, voltage, memory 
timings and speed. It also lets you keep 
track of temperatures and real-time speeds, 
create and manage multiple clocking 
profiles, and even disable cores to give 
those who exclusively run poorly-threaded 
applications more overclocking headroom. 
Although we’ll talk more about the Ryzen 
Master Utility in an upcoming issue, we 
can say that we really like the interface, 
especially compared to the UI disasters 
that most vendor-specific overclocking 
and monitoring utilities have become. 
the application and controller capabilities, 
some systems can achieve better 
performance from multi-rank DIMMs, 
while these can also suffer from a latency 
penalty due to the fact that only one rank 
can access the channel bus at a time. 
Officially supported memory on 
AMD’s AM4 platform breaks down 
like this, four dual-rank and single-rank 
DIMMs are limited to non-overclocked 
speeds of 1,866MTps and 2,133MTps, 
respectively. Two module kits of dual-
rank and single-rank DIMMs operate 
at 2,400MTps and 2,667MTps. 
Although these seem low for DDR4, 
most motherboards you can buy will 
support overclocked memory speeds, 
and that support will get better as time 
goes on. When shopping for the perfect 
kit of DDR4, rather than worrying 
about whether the memory you want 
to buy is dual- or single-rank—many 
memory vendors don’t tell you this—we 
recommend paying close attention to the 
list of qualified memory kits from your 
motherboard vendor of choice. 
According to AMD, Ryzen processors 
don’t offer memory dividers for DDR4-
3000 and DDR4-3400. As a result, 
anyone looking to run the fastest kits 
should buy memory clocked at 3,200 
or 3,500MTps. Robert Hallock, CPU 
Technology Evangelist at AMD, reports 
that his internal team have had success 
running two-DIMM 16GB kits that 
use Samsung “B-die” memory chips 
running at 2,933MTps, 3,200MTps, and 
3,500MTps. Models include Geil EVO X 
GEX416GB3200C16DC (16-16-16-36 @ 
1.35v), G.Skill Trident Z F4-3200C16D-
16GTZR (16-18-18-36 @ 1.35v), and 
Corsair CMK16GX4M2 B3200C16 
VERSION 5.39 (16-18-18-36 @ 1.35v). 
Overclocking FTW
We’ve said it before, but it bears 
repeating: Overclocking should not 
be a feature you have to pay for. By 
monetizing the unlocking of the 
multiplier and binning the chips to within 
nanometers of their thermal envelopes, 
Intel has systematically sucked the life 
out of the enthusiast practice. Ryzen 
It’s much more along the lines of Intel’s 
Extreme Tuning Utility and AMD’s Polaris 
overclocking, and both are very easy to use.
As ever, your chances of getting a 
similar—or better—overclock depend on 
a combination of your cooling subsystem, 
the processor’s unique thermal properties, 
and how much you’re willing to push your 
hardware. From what we’ve seen, 4.2GHz 
is about as high as you’ll be able to achieve 
with off-the-shelf liquid or air cooling. We 
raised the voltage from 1.35v to 1.475v to 
get our best and most stable results, but 
would advise against adding much more 
voltage to the processor. Make sure to 
keep an eye on your power draw, however, 
as these overclocks can turn your 95-watt 
processor into one that consumes over 
150-watts under a full load.
Ryzen From The Ashes
We’re still in the early days of AMD’s 
seeming resurrection. There are still 
unanswered questions, particularly on 
how the Ryzen 5 will stack up against 
Intel’s more affordable processors. AMD 
has also scheduled updates for April and 
May that are designed to clear up some of 
the software and firmware quirks that have 
popped up. But so far, we think it’s safe 
to say that enthusiasts now have a viable 
alternative to Intel’s CPUs that doesn’t 
come with any asterisks. Indeed, now’s a 
great time to build a new system.  ■
There are a slew of high-performance Ryzen boards available to make the perfect foundation for your 
next build. And by available, we mean hopefully back in stock soon.

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 
Pascal Gets The Titanium Treatment
Founders Edition when it launched. 
By comparison, the TITAN X arrived 
on the scene with an imposing $1,200 
price tag.
Gamers and enthusiasts ready to 
get behind the wheel of the supercar 
equivalent of a graphics card now have a 
remarkable opportunity: They can buy 
what is arguably the best card on the 
market for almost half of what the other
best card originally cost. The GTX 1080 
Ti is ready to state its case as this spring’s 
hottest commodity.
“The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is for 
enthusiast gamers who want the very 
best,” says Brandon Bell, NVIDIA senior 
technical marketing manager. “With 
its additional CUDA cores and greater 
memory footprint and bandwidth, the 
GTX 1080 Ti particularly excels at 4K 
F
lagship graphics cards are more 
important than ever. Creating 
“the most powerful GPU on the 
planet” to win bragging rights and curry 
favor with PC gamers might still confer 
a tactical advantage in the perpetual 
war between Green and Red, but we 
have now several ways to put all that 
pixel-pushing horsepower to work. Ever 
since we entered the age of VR and 4K 
gaming, there’s been no shortage of 
opportunities to punish even the fastest 
graphics cards. 
For the last few generations, if you 
wanted the best NVIDIA graphics 
card money could buy, your choice 
was painfully simple: You bought a 
TITAN. Since they first joined the 
family with the company’s Kepler micro-
architecture, TITAN graphics cards created 
a “Tier 0” in NVIDIA’s desktop GPU 
hierarchy. However, TITANs have also 
been painfully expensive. Never debuting 
for less than $999, TITANs have broken 
records and bank accounts in equal 
measure. Those unable to put together that 
much scratch still had a solid backup plan; 
the best “Ti”-branded cards in any given 
product family (for example, the GeForce 
GTX 780 Ti or GTX 980 Ti) were still 
beasts, even if they couldn’t trade punches 
with their respective TITANs.
This March at the Game Developer’s 
Conference in San Francisco, NVIDIA 
co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang 
announced the best possible plot twist 
when he revealed the GeForce GTX 
1080 Ti to the world. Instead of being a 
modest upgrade over its predecessor, the 
GTX 1080, the GTX 1080 Ti turned 
out to match the Pascal-based TITAN 
X nearly spec for spec. Despite this, 
Huang announced that the GTX 1080 
Ti Founders Edition’s retail price would 
be $699—the same as the GTX 1080 
gaming and for gamers driving multiple 
monitors in surround.”
Memory Makeover
Whenever a new graphics architecture is 
revealed, we tend to pay a lot of attention to 
the GPU itself, as both NVIDIA and AMD 
are constantly tweaking and refining their 
graphics processors to deal with increasingly 
demanding games, heavily parellelized 
workloads, and other advancements in 
graphics technologies (such as TressFX 
or HairWorks). We also eagerly await 
developments in manufacturing processes, 
since die shrinks let chip makers pack more 
transistors in the same space, resulting in 
cost savings, performance increases, and 
often both. Maybe, as was the case with 
the GTX 1080 Founders Edition, we’ll be 
treated to a radically redesigned cooler and/
NVIDIA brought along some heavy artillery at this year’s Game Developer’s Conference, officially 
announcing GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. The card immediately takes its place as the undisputed king of the 
GeForce GTX 10 Series, and it even gives the vaunted TITAN X a run for its money. 
CPU  /  April2017 51

Not satisfied with that result, NVIDIA 
wanted to turn the dial to 11 for the 
GTX 1080 Ti. “We worked closely 
with Micron on their first GDDR5X 
memory modules, and through 
this collaboration we’ve 
worked together 
to enable 
faster 11Gbps memory,” Bell says.
The original GDDR5X, first intro-
duced on the GTX 1080 and later on 
the TITAN X, couldn’t handle an 
11Gbps data rate. At such lofty speeds, 
the memory simply wasn’t reliable. After 
putting their heads together, engineers 
at Micron and NVIDIA devised a 
package of changes that cleaned up the 
memory interface signaling. According 
to official documentation, NVIDIA 
“refined the data channel to the DRAM, 
or innovations like Simultaneous Multi-
Projection. Then, after all the fanfare has 
died down, maybe everyone takes a closer 
look at the VRAM a new graphics card uses.
A graphics card’s VRAM is nonetheless 
a critical element. As games continue to 
pile on effect after effect to create more 
stunning visuals, GPUs need bigger and 
faster frame buffers in order to feed lots of 
details at high resolutions to a display. At 
lower resolutions, extra VRAM can 
go to waste, but flagship 
graphics cards can 
always put it to 
good use.
NVIDIA and 
AMD understand 
this, which is why 
we’ve seen a handful of 
noteworthy VRAM changes 
from both companies. AMD, for 
instance, stacked its Radeon R9 Fury cards 
with HBM (high-bandwidth memory) 
rather than GDDR5, which has been a 
staple on graphics cards for almost a decade.
The GeForce GTX 1080, GTX 1080 
Ti, TITAN X, and the rest of NVIDIA’s 
Pascal-based desktop GPUs rely on GDDR5; 
for the aforementioned top three cards in 
the Pascal stack, NVIDIA took its GDDR5 
further. A partnership between NVIDIA and 
Micron ushered in GDDR5X, which, as 
you might expect, runs faster than GDDR5. 
The effective memory clock on the GTX 
1080 and TITAN X is an impressive 5GHz, 
resulting in a data rate of 10Gbps.
used advanced equalization techniques 
to reduce adverse effects of the physical 
interface, and minimized jitter and noise.” 
Together, the modifications let NVIDIA 
ratchet up the GTX 1080 Ti’s GDDR5X 
effective clock to 5,500MHz, good for an 
11Gbps data rate.
The GTX 1080 Ti also boasts more 
VRAM than the GTX 1080—an extra 
3GB. Considering the GTX 1080 Ti’s 
similarities with the TITAN X, however, 
you could also argue that NVIDIA simply 
lopped off 1GB of GDDR5X from the 
TITAN X. (A glance at the GTX 1080 
Ti board image above makes the latter 
notion even more convincing.) Possessing 
11GB of GDDR5X to the TITAN X’s 
12GB would normally put the GTX 
1080 Ti at a disadvantage, but the GTX 
1080 Ti’s improved GDDR5X balances 
the scales. With its new VRAM and a 
352-bit bus, the GTX 1080 Ti musters 
a maximum memory bandwidth of 
484GBps. By comparison, the TITAN X’s 
480GBps falls slightly short.
As a Pascal GPU, the GTX 1080 Ti 
has a few other tricks up its sleeve, which 
helps it wring even more performance 
Alas, the venerable DVI port didn’t make the cut on the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti’s backplane, but the payoff is 
worth it, we think. By removing the DVI port, NVIDIA was able to increase the exhaust area for the cooler, 
resulting in twice as much airflow compared to the GeForce GTX 1080 Founder’s Edition.
The GeForce GTX 
1080 Ti has more GDDR5X 
than the GTX 1080, but NVIDIA didn’t 
just slap down a few extra chips and call it a day. 
In addition to 11 32-bit memory controllers adding up to a 
352-bit bus (the GTX 1080 relies on a 256-bit bus), this memory has 
been optimized to run at truly insane speeds. Ti’s overall memory bandwidth of 
11Gbps eclipses the TITAN X’s, giving the former a performance edge in some situations. 
52 April2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

since the turn of the century, doesn’t 
make the cut. Instead, the GTX 1080 
Ti’s rear bracket has three DisplayPort 
and one HDMI output. By eliminating 
the DVI port, NVIDIA was able to 
double the cooler’s airflow.
Bell also points out another rear 
bracket modification likely to elude all 
but the most eagle-eyed enthusiasts. 
“There were changes made to the GTX 
1080 Ti’s cover to reduce the lip on the 
I/O bracket compared to the GTX 1080. 
If you look closely at the lip of your GTX 
1080’s bracket . . . you’ll see that the 
GTX 1080 Ti’s bracket is slightly thinner. 
Removing this wasted space on GTX 
1080 Ti further enhances airflow.”
In its internal testing, NVIDIA 
demonstrated the effects of these mods 
by testing the GTX 1080 and the GTX 
1080 Ti with a 220W power draw. 
(We’ll point out that in this scenario 
the GTX 1080 is actually operating 
beyond its 180W TDP, while the GTX 
1080 Ti is running below its 250W 
TDP.) With both cards drawing the 
out of its VRAM. Tiled caching uses a 
tiled rendering approach combined with 
the GPU’s L2 cache to reduce per pixel 
bandwidth. Lossless 4:1 and 8:1 delta 
color compression is another memory 
bandwidth booster. Although NVIDIA 
points out that real-world gains vary from 
game to game, the combination of tiled 
caching and delta color compression can 
theoretically boost the GTX 1080 Ti’s 
memory bandwidth well beyond the 
480GBps spec.
Cooler Cooler
Aside from the Pascal architecture 
itself, the GTX 1080 Founders Edition 
distinguished itself with an attractive 
blower-style cooler, which blasts the 
card’s heat directly out the back of the 
chassis. Although NVIDIA largely left 
the cooler’s inner workings alone on the 
GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition, the 
company did make a couple of changes 
to the rear bracket that yielded airflow 
gains. First and foremost, the DVI 
output, a mainstay on graphics cards 
same amount of power, the GTX 1080 
Ti’s cooler was quieter (2.5dB) and 
more effective.
The GTX 1080 Ti retains the GTX 
1080’s backplate design. Half of the 
backplate is removable, which provides 
additional airflow when multiple cards are 
yoked together in SLI.
Fetching FETs
Speaking of power, NVIDIA paid 
special attention to the GTX 1080 Ti’s 
power supply. The board is positively 
teeming with dualFETs, as NVIDIA 
used a pair for every one of the GTX 
1080 Ti’s seven power phases. Thanks to 
the extra dualFETs, NVIDIA was able to 
smooth out the GTX 1080 Ti’s efficiency 
curve; at 150W, the card remains nearly 
85% efficient, and it stays above 80% 
efficient at 200W, besting the GTX 1080 
and GTX 980.
With its beefy power subsystem and 
refined cooler, the GTX 1080 Ti has an 
extra gear for times when it can rev its 
engine. NVIDIA reports that the card’s 
clock can soar to 2GHz. Overclockers 
should find plenty of potential waiting for 
them to exploit.
Pascal’s Final Form
By most accounts, NVIDIA’s Pascal 
rollout over the last year has gone 
according to plan. Power users holding 
out for a big discount on a top-shelf 
graphics card are in luck: The GeForce 
GTX 1080 Ti performs like a TITAN X 
but sells like a GTX 1080. ■
NVIDIA appears to have squeezed every last drop 
of performance out of its Pascal architecture, 
making the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti a dynamite 
option for enthusiasts.

Can We Build It? 
Alphacool Custom Hardline Cooling Tutorial, Part I
terephthalate glycol) tubing, all custom 
liquid-cooling systems typically require 
the same core components. These 
include a waterblock for the CPU and/
or GPU(s), one or more radiators, a 
pump, fittings (two for each component 
in the loop), some kind of liquid 
coolant, and a reservoir. 
CPU waterblocks need to be 
compatible with your motherboard socket 
mounting mechanisms. Our loop is for 
the CPU only, so we had Alphacool 
send us the Eisblock XPX. The system 
we’re installing it in is running a Ryzen 7 
1700X processor and an AORUS AX370-
Gaming 5 motherboard, and happily, the 
Eisblock XPX was perfectly compatible 
with the AM4 socket. 
Although a CPU block only needs to 
support the socket to properly fit in your 
system, full-cover GPU blocks need to 
be manufactured to the specifications 
of your particular graphics card model. 
Even minor variances in the position of 
VRM components and memory chips 
outside the case. (External radiators 
used to be much more common back in 
the day, which is why many cases still 
come with rubber-grommeted cooling 
ports in pairs built into their back 
panels.) Theoretically, the more liquid 
running through the system, the closer 
to ambient temperature you’ll be able 
to get the components. However, there 
are diminishing returns when it comes 
to liquid cooling, and the degree of the 
overclock, as well as the thermal leakage 
properties of your CPU and GPU, also 
play major roles. 
So, at the end of the day, it’s mostly 
about the visual appeal. There is a 
performance angle, sure, but installing 
a sleek custom liquid-cooling system is 
arguably the most aesthetically striking

Cooling Parts List
Whether you’re using flexible or 
hardline acrylic/PETG (polyethylene 
Y
ou don’t have to be an avid fan of 
CPU’s Mad Reader Mods to have 
noticed custom liquid cooling’s—
almost overnight—transition from soft 
silicone tubing to hardline. Although 
the performance characteristics for a 
hardline system shouldn’t be any 
different compared to a flexible tubing-
based cooling setup, the visual appeal 
of the former is undeniable. In all the 
time that we’ve been covering custom 
cooling, we have yet to actually build 
our own custom hard-tube loop. That 
changes with this two-part series 
designed walk you through the process 
of part picking, installing, bending, and 
filling a custom hardline liquid-cooling 
system from start to finish. 
But Why . . . Seriously?
Although most enthusiasts know 
the answer, we occasionally get asked 
why one would consider filling an 
expensive high-performance PC with 
a custom liquid-cooling setup. There 
are the thermal considerations; we all 
know that the clocks of a component 
like a processor or GPU can be pushed 
higher when they’re running cool. But 
of course a closed-loop liquid cooler 
gets the job done without getting your 
hands wet. There are even semi-closed 
systems, such as Alphacool’s expandable 
Eisbaer, which let you incorporate a 
liquid-cooled graphics card or two. 
Although these “set and forget” systems 
will perform better than air coolers, their 
overall cooling capacity is hard limited. 
By going the custom route, you can install 
multiple radiators, massive reservoirs, and 
a half-dozen or more waterblocks. With a 
custom loop, you’re only limited by how 
much you can fit into your enclosure, 
and some enterprising modders have no 
qualms about mounting cooling gear 
Custom liquid-cooling systems using hardline tubing can make any PC look impressive.

got a 120/140mm bracket that lets us 
mount the Eisbecher to a radiator, or in 
our case, to a 120mm fan mount on the 
bottom of the case. 
This tutorial will focus on building 
a hardline tubing system, and as 
a result, the fittings we acquired are 
designed to be used with acrylic or 
PETG tubing. If you want to build a 
flexible tubing-based system, we’ve had 
success with compression fittings from 
a number of vendors including XSPC, 
EK, and Swiftech.
The tubing we used is Alphacool’s 
Eisrohr 13/10mm (ID 3/8-inch OD 
½-inch) PETG HardTube, in 80cm 
sections. Based on our experience, 
it’s best to order considerably more 
than you’ll need, especially if you’re 
just learning how to do it for the 
first time. As we went to press, the 
general consensus among modders 
and boutique PC builders seems to be 
that PETG is preferable to the more 
brittle and harder to bend acrylic. 
PETG is slightly more flexible, less 
prone to cracking, but may allow liquid 
to evaporate over time more than a 
comparable acrylic tube. 
In addition to choosing the style 
of tubing, you also need to match the 
fittings to the ID (inner diameter) and 
OD (outer diameter) of your tubing. 
The reservoir we’re using is the 
Alphacool Eisbecher D5, which mounts 
seamlessly to the Alphacool Eispumpe 
VPP755 pump. Keeping the reservoir 
and pump together as a single unit cuts 
down on the tubing we need to run, 
and the 250mm-tall clear reservoir holds 
plenty of liquid to keep our overclocked 
Ryzen 7 processor running cool. We also 
on the PCB, as well as the overall size 
and shape of the PCB, can result in block 
compatibility issues. 
Reservoirs and radiators are bulky, and 
if you’re working on an older case or one 
that was not designed with liquid cooling 
in mind, you may not be able to easily 
mount those items without significantly 
modifying the enclosure. There are lots 
of size options to consider when deciding 
on a radiator (or radiators), but the 
most important limiting factor is your 
case. Most cases built for liquid cooling 
support radiators that mount easily to 
120mm fans, in 120 (one fan), 240 (two 
fans), 360 (three fans), and 480 (four 
fans) sizes. Fans and radiators sized in 
140mm increments will tend to offer 
more cooling capacity or let you operate 
the fans at lower RPMs to get similar 
results. Because we’re only cooling the 
processor, a single 240mm radiator, in 
the form of the NexXxos XT45, was our 
ideal choice. Also, don’t forget to pair the 
radiator with appropriately sized fans. 
Fans designed to produce high static 
pressure are best suited for mounting 
to radiators. Alphacool sent us a pair of 
120mm NB-eLoop Bionic fans. 
There are a variety of ways to mount the large Alphacool Eisbecher D5 reservoir, and its 
capacity will chill even our overclocked Ryzen 7. Also, we’re happy to report that that 
Alphacool’s Eisblock XPX supports the AM4 socket right out of the box.
Alphacool’s Eddy Peters helpfully sent us a few extras he thought we’d need. He was right.

gun, gloves, a cutting tool, and a silicone 
insert. Our heat gun is a 1,200-watt 
model that has a high and low setting 
and that can be set upright for hands-
free heating. Any pair of gloves that will 
insulate your hands from the exhaust 
of the heat gun and let you handle the 
heated plastic without burning your 
fingers will work. To cut the tube to size, 
we ordered the Alphacool pit saw, which 
has an impressive-looking 35cm blade. 
The silicone insert should be measured 
to fit fairly snugly inside the tubes to 
ensure that the tube doesn’t collapse 
or kink when bending. The 100cm 
Alphacool Silicon Bending Insert we got 
is sized for the 10mm ID of the tubes 
we’re working with. If the insert is a little 
too snug, try sanding it down slightly 
with a piece of sandpaper. We also 
recommend using a little bit of olive oil 
to lubricate the insert for easy removal 
once the bend is complete. According 
to Richard “DarthBeavis” Surroz, who 
is no stranger to PETG bending, olive 
oil is ideal because it doesn’t burn as the 
pipe is heated and it cleans up easily. 
Another tip we got from DB is to use 
an eyeliner pencil to make the marks on 
the pipe so you know the portion to heat 
for each bend. Once bent, the marks 
can be wiped away.
Once you’ve bent the pipes and cut 
them to the appropriate lengths, it’s a 
good idea to use a deburring tool on 
the inner and outer edges of each piece 
that you’ll be slotting into a fitting. This 
ensures a snug leak-free fit every time. We 
used the double-sided Alphacool Acrylic 
Tubing Pipe Reamer, which features 
blades for deburring the inside and 
outside of the pipe on either end. 
Slow Down At The Bends
When it comes to actually bending and 
shaping the heated tube, there are several 
tools that can help you get solid results. 
Some experienced builders prefer to bend 
by hand. Next month, as we conclude 
our project, we’ll try our hand at a little 
bit of everything and put the finishing 
touches on our first custom hardline 
tubing project. ■
After perusing the cooling parts list, 
you could be forgiven for thinking the 
difference between that process and 
installing a hardline tubing system is 
just a minor matter of bending the 
tubes. While that’s true, bending and 
cutting hard tubes is an involved and 
somewhat complicated endeavor that 
requires more than a few pieces of 
specialized equipment, and (at least for 
us) a lot of trial and even more error. 
If our experience is any indication, you 
won’t get it right the first time, and 
maybe not even the second time. But 
the end result will be worth the piles 
of hideously misshapen plastic littering 
your workspace. Spoiler alert for Part 
II of this article (which will appear in 
our May issue): We have a newfound 
respect for the skill that goes into the 
hardline tubing designs that grace the 
pages of this magazine every month. 
Must-Haves
There are a handful of items that are 
absolutely required for bending PETG 
or acrylic tubes, and they include a heat 
For our build, we got Alphacool’s G1/4 
(this refers to the 0.25-inch thread 
interface) Eiszapfen 13mm HardTube 
compression fittings, which are 
designed to work with the 13mm OD 
and 10mm ID PETG tubing we used. 
Although they seem superfluous, the set 
of four Alphacool rotatable Eiszapfen 
L-Connectors we got gave us a good 
deal of play when it came to sizing the 
tubing for the radiator. These little 
extras let us focus on making the pipes 
look straight and giving them a snug fit 
without having to resort to re-bending 
the tube with our heat gun. 
For this build, space shouldn’t be a 
problem for us; we’re using CaseLabs’ 
cavernous Merlin SM8, which has been 
given a stunning CPU-themed udate 
designed by our friends at BSMods. 
(Thanks again, guys!) 
Tools Of The Trade
When installing a flexible tubing 
cooling system, the only required 
equipment is a hearty pair of scissors, 
a funnel, and some paper towels. 
We’ve got a tough job ahead of us as we try to make the interior of the CaseLabs Merlin SM8 as 
impressive as its BSMods-designed paint job.

Beat The Heat With A New CPU Cooler
Of all the rites of passage an initiate must complete before being accepted into our tribe of enthusiasts, over-
clocking a CPU is among the most venerated. For first-timers, the idea of pushing the processor beyond its stock 
clock can be a daunting task, but we don’t send anyone into the wild to slay this beast without a proper weapon. 
Nothing instills confidence quite like bringing a reliable and powerful CPU cooler to the fight. Whether you choose 
to use a heatsink and fan or build an elaborate custom watercooling loop, the right setup is essential to keep your 
cranked-up CPU running within its thermal envelope.
Now, we understand that overclocking isn’t for everyone or every system. Virtually every processor needs some 
form of cooling, though, and we think you can do better than the meager heatsink and whiny fan packaged with 
most retail boxed processors. Aftermarket coolers do more than make world record overclocks possible, after all; 
even knocking a few decibels off your rig’s noise output is enough to justify an upgrade. We’ve collected an 18-
pack of coolers ranging from budget-friendly to bombastic. There really is something for everyone.
Ryzen Rendezvous
At the beginning of March, AMD released its hotly anticipated Ryzen 7 processors to enthusiasts eager to put 
the company’s Zen architecture on the test track. And if the rollout continues according to plan, Ryzen 5 chips 
should be available shortly after you read this.
These new processors use a new socket—AM4—and that means some coolers may not be compatible with Ryzen 
CPUs. Several manufacturers have already started including AM4 adapters with their coolers, and others make them 
available by request and/or as an optional purchase. If you’re rolling with Ryzen, double-check that your chosen cooler 
is compatible. Contact the manufacturer if necessary. Their coolers might be updated even if their websites aren’t.
Nice Threads
Closed-loop liquid coolers aren’t as closed as they used to be. Today, lots of AIO (all-in-one) units have G1/4 threads, 
and some also include tubing with quick-disconnects. When you decide to step up to a more substantial loop, these 
coolers can stick around, stretching your enthusiast dollar further. Other amenities such as LED-lit waterblocks and 
prepackaged coolant dyes let you put a little custom in your closed-loop cooler.

Why You’ll Dig It: Corsair’s Hydro Series H110i is a beast with brains. First, a 280mm radiator provides a ton of surface area for exhausting heat, 
and the pair of SP140L PWM fans produce insanely high static pressure (3.99mm-H2O, in case you were wondering). Together the radiator and fans 
combine to rapidly remove heat from the coolant as it courses through this closed-loop cooler. The H110i’s pump/waterblock combo unit does more 
than absorb heat from the CPU and keep the loop’s coolant flowing. Equipped with Corsair Link, plug the H110i’s Corsair Link cable into a USB header 
on your motherboard and download the free software 
from Corsair’s website. Using the software, you can keep 
an eye on the temperature of both the coolant and your 
CPU, change the LEDs on the block unit, and set the LEDs 
to change color according to temperature. 
Who Should Apply: Intrepid overclockers who 
want to know exactly how their handiwork is affecting 
CPU temps.

Why You’ll Dig It: The Eisbaer 360 is an AIO with lots of room to grow. When the time comes to expand your loop, its radiator and pump/waterblock 
combo unit have G1/4 threads, making them compatible with the vast majority of custom liquid-cooling hardware. The Eisbaer is also equipped with 
Alphacool’s quick-disconnect system, which lets you combine it with one of Alphacool’s Eiswolf GPU AIOs in a matter of seconds. Of course, the Eisbaer 
is an outstanding cooler even if you have no intention 
of going beyond watercooling your CPU. It’s virtually 
overflowing with exceptional Alphacool components, 
including a 360mm NexXxos radiator, Eiswind fans, and 
a windowed pump/block combo unit that lets you take a 
peek at the action. There’s a fill port atop the combo unit, 
too, so maintenance is a snap.

Why You’ll Dig It: Inside and out, the Hydro Series H100i v2 exhibits the careful thought Corsair puts into its AIO CPU coolers. The H100i v2’s 
240mm radiator should fit into virtually any case (aside from some obvious exclusions, like certain SFF and HTPC cases), making it an ideal choice for 
a variety of systems and builds. Like the Hydro Series H110i, Corsair goes all in on static pressure. Unlike some closed-loop liquid coolers, which could 
use any old fan(s), the H100i v2 has a pair of SP120L fans. These blowers are built to be bolted to rads, which the H100i v2’s rated static pressure of 
4.65mm-H2O clearly shows; there aren’t too many fans capable of pushing air through a radiator’s fins as forcefully as the SP120Ls. And of course, 
Corsair Link is as useful as ever on the H100i v2. Download it for free to keep tabs on temps, control the LEDs on the H100i v2’s pump/block combo 
unit, and more.
Who Should Apply: If the Hydro

Why You’ll Dig It: Plenty of closed-loop liquid coolers keep their coolant hidden behind opaque tubing. Swiftech demands that you show it off, 
supplying the H220 X2 with everything you need to make your own visual statement. In addition to using clear Mayhems tubing, Swiftech adds a clear 
acrylic reservoir and then puts it front and center. Squeeze in a few (or several) drops from the set of included Mayhems dyes (red, green, and blue) 
to match the H220 X2 to the rest of your build’s color scheme. (We’d 
recommend testing dye combinations outside the loop before you 
commit to tinting your coolant.) Swiftech’s Apogee XL2 waterblock

Why You’ll Dig It: Think of Alphacool’s Eiswand as an AIO with some 
assembly required. Once it is assembled, though, look out. Obviously 
not designed to fit inside a case (hint: now’s your chance to finally use 
your case’s predrilled tubing holes), Alphacool takes advantage of having 
no size restrictions to build a radiator housing of massive proportions. 
Lurking inside is a 360mm NexXxos XT45 radiator, six—count ’em, 
six—Eiswind fans, and a double helping of Alphacool’s DC-LT 2600 
ultra-low noise ceramic pump. Cut the tubing, hook up the Eiswand’s 
tower of power to the included NexXxoS XP3 Light waterblock, fill it up 
with Alphacool CKC coolant, and reap the rewards. 
Who Should Apply: Power users who plan on pushing their CPU to 
new heights.

Why You’ll Dig It: Zalman’s diminutive CNPS2X might keep a 
low profile, but it makes its presence known in other ways. Shorter 
than a lot of memory modules, vertical clearance won’t be a problem 
with the CNPS2X. Because of its donut shape, you’ll only find a single 
heatpipe on the CNPS2X, but Zalman makes it count. Using “S” bending 
technology, Zalman wraps the heatpipe around the entire circumference 
of the radially oriented heatsink fins and then shoots it through the 
heatsink’s base, where it makes direct contact with your CPU’s heat 
spreader. Topping out at 22.7dB(A), the CNPS2X keeps quiet while it 
keeps your CPU cool.
Who Should Apply: The CNPS2X is tailor-made for SFF systems and 
HTPCs, but anyone using a Mini-ITX motherboard should give this CPU 
cooler a look.

Why You’ll Dig It: Following up on its Freezer i11 family, ARCTIC 
has released the Freezer 12, a compact cooler capable of holding 
high-end processors in check. (The Freezer 12 is compatible with Intel 
LGA 2011-3 and AMD AM4 sockets, among others.) ARCTIC’s focus on 
acoustics is obvious, as the Freezer 12 has several features designed to 
operate as quietly as possible. The 92mm fan is equipped with rubber 
mounts that keep vibration to a minimum, and the Freezer 12 has the 
same passive cooling mode as the Freezer 33 series. If the Freezer 12’s 
heatsink can handle a particular thermal load by itself, the fan remains 
dormant and, more importantly, silent. ARCTIC also includes a syringe of 
its high-performance MX-4 thermal paste.
Who Should Apply: Power users interested in a CPU cooler that 
tackles heat without making a ruckus.

Why You’ll Dig It: Better known for its cutting-edge 
motherboards and graphics cards, MSI’s product porfolio includes 
everything from gaming mice to high-end PCs. It’s no surprise 
that the company dabbles in CPU cooling, as well. MSI has put a 
lot of R&D into the coolers it attaches to its graphics cards, so it 
only makes sense that the Core Frozr L shares some of that DNA. 
Specifically, the cooler relies on one of MSI’s patented TORX fans to 
keep air moving. A TORX fan includes what MSI calls dispersion fan 
blades, which have a steeper curve for more airflow. And if you want 
to add a little pull to your push, you can easily clip a second fan (sold 
separately, but the mounting hardware is included with the cooler) to 
the Core Frozr L’s back.
Who Should Apply: MSI loyalists who are well acquainted with 
MSI’s workmanship and want to extend it with additional components.

Why You’ll Dig It: The Pure Rock certainly lives up to its 
creator’s moniker. Even when the cooler’s 120mm fan is swirling at 
full strength, the Pure Rock’s maximum noise output doesn’t exceed 
25.4dB(A); as far as fans go, that’s being pretty quiet. The secret to 
the Pure Rock’s small sonic footprint is its SilentWings PWM fan. be 
quiet! shapes the nine fan blades to minimize the turbulence that 
leads to noise. Obviously, the Pure Rock has more going for it than 
a fancy fan. A quartet of 6mm copper heatpipes runs through the 
Pure Rock’s base and aluminum fins. At the top of the cooler, the 
heatpipes are capped with aluminum to match the top cover. For 
under 35 bucks, the Pure Rock can handle CPUs up to 150W TDP.
Who Should Apply: Power users who want an affordable CPU 
cooler that knows how to stay quiet.

Spring Data Cleaning 
Tips, Tricks & Apps To Take Back Your Storage
forth, but you should be mindful of other 
important items that could inadvertently 
end up flushed down the drain—
permanently, in some cases—during a 
clean install.
To start, find your keys. That means 
product keys. It’s a lot easier to pack up 
and move apps than it was years ago, but 
a program that requires a key will usually 
want it again as soon as you reinstall it. 
For that matter, perhaps you’ve been less 
than vigilant with your Windows key. In 
either situation, you need a way to recover 
those strings of numbers and letters.
Thankfully, there’s no shortage of 
free programs that will recover AWOL 
keys. One of our favorites is Magical 
Jelly Bean KeyFinder. In addition to not 
costing a dime, MJBK is lightweight 
and easy to use. It will recapture keys 
for about 300 software titles in addition 
to Windows. Belarc Advisor works well, 
too, and provides lots of additional 
what’s inside counts, too. You didn’t 
spend thousands of dollars assembling a 
dream team of components only to have 
them play like the Washington Generals, 
so let’s draw up battle plans to fight back.
The Nuclear Option
As tempting as it is to issue the blanket 
statement, “every PC, no matter how far 
gone, can be salvaged,” we’re not averse 
to cutting our losses and throwing in the 
towel when a fresh start is the best choice. 
Rather than track down every last bit of 
detritus, a clean Windows installation 
wipes away everything in one step.
Obviously, we don’t recommend 
breaking out your installation media and 
pressing the self-destruct button without 
a second thought. If your computer is 
anything like ours, there’s plenty of good 
that you don’t want to toss out alongside 
the bad. Sure, you’ll want to back up 
photos, important documents, and so 
I
mmaculate rigs are one of the telltale 
signs of serious enthusiasts, and they’re 
easy to spot. You all know the hallmarks: 
case panels free of pizza-laced fingerprints, 
power and data cables properly wrangled 
and tucked out of sight, LED lights 
that match the rest of the system’s color 
scheme, and more. We take pride in our 
PCs and want them to look their best.
Appearances can be deceiving, though, 
and we aren’t talking about the horrors 
we hide behind a solid right-side panel. 
As we fly from website to website, 
download and install dozens of programs, 
and shuffle media files to and from our 
home server, digital garbage builds up. 
Like its real-world counterpart, the trash 
collecting on our machines rarely starts as 
a serious problem. At first, you might not 
even notice it; if an uninstalled program 
leaves behind remnants that don’t affect 
overall performance, how likely are you to 
hunt down orphaned files?
If you’re not careful, you can turn 
into a full-blown data hoarder. You 
start telling concerned friends and 
family that your bloated web browser 
cache is actually a good thing, “because 
I might want to make a return trip to 
freshneildegrassetysonmemes.com, and 
shaving half a second off the load time 
is something I need in my life.” Instead 
of eradicating dubiously useful apps that 
drag down boot times, you simply stop 
shutting down your PC. Rather than 
shredding massive files and folders you 
never use, you buy another hard drive. 
(“They’re cheap, anyway.”)
We don’t like seeing all this sludge 
polluting system drives and ruining 
lives. It’s time to break the cycle and 
return your PC to its original condition 
(or as close as possible, anyway). No, 
meticulously organized files and folders 
aren’t as sexy as a fully modded PC, but 
CPU  /  April2017 69

than not, a targeted approach will take care 
of these problems much more quickly.
Call A Cleaner
Most power users prefer a hands-on 
approach to computing, favoring their 
own skills over software wizards and 
one-click performance optimizers. 
However, this attitude relates more to 
the “fun stuff,” such as overclocking, case 
modding, and so forth, rather than the 
tedium involved with picking 
through the Registry. No one 
signs up to be a PC enthusiast 
because taking out the trash is an 
exhilarating experience.
For cleaning the crap on a 
system, few programs are as good 
as the one that was originally 
called “Crap Cleaner.” Now with 
a more dignified name, Piriform’s 
CCleaner (www.piriform.com
/ccleaner) is still going strong 13 
years after its debut, and it’s usually 
the first program we turn to if we 
need to dump lots of useless files 
in a little amount of time. Piriform 
updates CCleaner on a monthly 
basis, so it continues to be more 
efficient. As a freemium app, you 
can pay for additional features 
(such as the $24.99 Professional 
version’s real-time monitoring), but 
we’ve found CCleaner Free capable 
of handling most cleaning jobs.
Once you launch CCleaner, 
the program gets right down to 
business, presenting you with all of its 
cleaning tools for Windows and other 
supported apps on your system. For 
Windows cleaning, CCleaner targets Edge 
and Internet Explorer browsers, Windows 
Explorer, and Windows system files. 
Its primary targets are things like your 
web browser’s cache and temporary files, 
memory dumps, and log files, but the 
program can shred lots of other things, 
as well.
Decide what you want CCleaner 
to scan for and fix by checking and 
unchecking the relevant boxes, then click 
Analyze. CCleaner goes to work and 
shows you an itemized report of its kill 
and decide which ones will survive your 
nuke-and-pave operation. Uncheck the 
drivers you don’t want and then click Start 
Backup. Relaunch DriverBackup! after the 
clean installation and switch to Restore 
mode. Point the program to the backup 
file you created, click Restore, and let 
DriverBackup! work its magic.
You should also double-check licenses 
and DRM on any software and music/
movies you’ve purchased. As an easy 
example, Apple limits the number 
of devices that are authorized to play 
content bought from iTunes. Commercial 
software licenses are a similar animal, 
usually limiting the installations you 
can perform to a specific number of 
machines. We recommend de-authorizing 
any program that imposes such limits 
before the big reset.
A clean installation is virtually 
guaranteed to purge unwanted files and 
clear away any gremlins causing system 
slowdowns and other issues, but it can be 
a time-consuming process, especially for 
enthusiasts whose systems are laden with 
apps, games, and other data. More often 
system info. Try these before using a paid 
key finder, which can suss out keys for 
thousands of programs.
Although we ultimately want to return 
obese web browsers to a slimmer figure, 
you may want to bring along some of your 
browser’s weight if your plan is to wipe 
your drives and start from scratch. If you 
already sign in to your browser, then you’re 
halfway home, thanks to syncing. (All major 
browsers can do it to varying degrees.) 
If you’d rather roll up your sleeves 
and do it yourself, or if you don’t 
want your browser’s sync feature 
to take everything with it, you 
might be able to hand-pick things 
depending on what browser you 
use. For example, if you dig in to 
Chrome’s flags, you can manually 
export the usernames and passwords 
you’ve saved in the browser. Open 
Chrome, type chrome://flags in 
the address bar, press ENTER, 
and scroll down to Password 
Import and Export. Select Enabled 
and restart Chrome. Next, type 
chrome://settings/passwords and 
press ENTER. Chrome should 
display its stored login credentials. 
Click Export, enter your Windows 
password, and save the .CSV file. 
On your clean PC, enable the 
export/import flag in Chrome, open 
the passwords window, and click 
Import to transfer the credentials.
We’ll assume you know how to 
find and back up your personal 
files, but gathering your device drivers 
before blowing up your current Windows 
installation might save you time and a 
headache or two. Although the majority of 
drivers are available online and Windows 
itself does a decent job finding drivers 
for most hardware, there are free utilities 
that can round up your drivers and have 
them ready for a clean install. Available 
at open-source megasite SourceForge, 
DriverBackup! scans your system for 
drivers and then packages them together. 
After you’ve downloaded and extracted 
the ZIP folder (yes, DriverBackup! is 
portable, too), open the program, select 
the Backup mode, review your drivers, 
Even if you plan on blowing up your Windows installation and performing a 
clean installation, some things should survive. Google Chrome can export login 
credentials to a .CSV file, which you can import on the clean OS.

Windows. In Windows 10, for example, 
you can access your system’s startup 
list from the Task Manager. However, 
CCleaner pulls all of the functions together 
and wraps them in an approachable UI, 
making it ideal for anyone who wants 
an easy and painless cleaning session. 
Advanced users can check out CCleaner’s 
command-line parameters (www.piriform
.com/docs/ccleaner/advanced-usage
/command-line-parameters) to further 
extend CCleaner’s functionality.
Seek & Destroy
Just like you don’t need an exhaustive 
tutorial on backing up your important 
data, we doubt you need any hand-
holding to delete fat files and free up 
extra space. Gargantuan movie files 
don’t exactly hide themselves, after all. 
However, with the help of a free and 
very colorful utility, you can effortlessly 
see exactly where on your drives the 
worst offenders are holed up and 
perhaps discover potential inefficiencies 
and/or redundancies.
WinDirStat (windirstat.net), open-
source software developed by Bernhard 
Seifert and Oliver Schneider, hasn’t been 
updated in almost a decade, but it’s 
withstood the test of time and remains 
our go-to program for mapping out the 
files on our drives. We like WinDirStat 
because of its unpretentious design, low 
Startup and disable or delete anything 
you suspect is a drag on your system. 
Unless you’ve filled your storage drive(s) 
to capacity, tweaking your startup list will 
probably have a greater impact on system 
performance than deleting data.
With the possible exception of 
CCleaner’s duplicate file finder, every 
ability under the program’s Tools umbrella 
is at your disposal elsewhere within 
list and how much space you’ll reclaim by 
letting the program eradicate the tagged 
files. Click Run Cleaner, and CCleaner 
takes care of the rest. Its built-in Registry 
cleaner functions the same way. CCleaner 
offers to tidy up Registry gunk like 
missing DLLs and unused file extensions. 
Click Scan For Issues, review the Registry 
items CCleaner has marked for deletion 
(we can’t remember a time we spared 
something from CCleaner’s axe), and 
click Fix Selected Issues.
Although CCleaner makes short 
work of your PC’s belly fat, its cleaning 
capabilities are only a fraction of its total 
power. For the next step of your storage 
cleanse, click the program’s Tools tile. 
Here, you can perform tasks such as 
uninstalling programs, disabling browser 
plug-ins, and setting restore points. 
Drive Wiper is an easy way to shred an 
entire drive’s worth of data, but you’ll 
obviously want to make sure there’s 
nothing on a drive you won’t regret firing 
off into oblivion.
The real jewel of the collection is 
CCleaner’s ability to stop selected 
programs from launching at startup. 
After you’ve clicked the Tools Tile, click 
Piriform’s CCleaner does a lot more than delete your browser cache.
WinDirStat can show you which files are hogging the storage, and it lets you quickly dispatch them.

slate. We also suggest you use it any time you 
upgrade your graphics card. To grab it, point 
your browser to Guru3D.com.
After extracting the DDU ZIP file, 
open the program (starting in Safe Mode 
is recommended) and turn it loose on your 
system’s graphics drivers. DDU will offer 
you a few choices for wiping away your 
drivers, such as Clean And Restart or Clean 
And Shutdown, plus a nice list of 
more advanced options (saving 
log files, creating a restore point, 
etc.). Set up DDU according to 
the type of cleaning you need 
and let it take care of any display-
driver problem that simply won’t 
go away.
Gone For Good
Now that your computer’s 
drives are sparkling clean again, 
get in the habit of chucking 
your garbage on a regular 
basis. For typical files, you can 
configure Windows to skip 
the dialog box about tossing a 
file into the Recycle Bin and 
even bypass the Recycle Bin 
altogether if you’re feeling 
particularly bold. For the 
former, open the Recycle Bin’s 
Properties dialog box and uncheck the 
Display Delete Confirmation Dialog 
checkbox. If you want to break up with 
the Recycle Bin for good, click the radio 
button next to “Don’t Move Files To The 
Recycle Bin. Remove Files Immediately 
When Deleted.”
You can go further. With Eraser (eraser
.heidi.ie), files you delete don’t linger on 
your drive until another file needs the 
space. Instead, Eraser attacks them with 
an arsenal of data-sanitization methods 
(DoD 5220.22-M, Gutmann, etc.). By 
enabling the Windows Explorer extension 
during installation, you can add Eraser to 
Explorer’s context menu, making the file 
shredder a right-click away. 
Despite the steady decline of HDD 
and SSD prices over the years, storage 
still isn’t cheap. If you want your gigs 
back, check out these programs and 
start cleaning. ■
the drive. When you click one of the file 
formats, WinDirStat highlights every file 
with the chosen format. On our laptop, 
DLLs sat at the top of the stack, and we 
generally want to avoid those. However, if 
you have a particular type of file, such as 
JPEGs, scattered across several folders on 
a drive, WinDirStat shows you where they 
are. Clear away what you don’t want.
Drive Away Display Drivers
Every power user who has owned a 
graphics card will experience the occasional 
problem with graphics drivers, including 
turncoat enthusiasts who regularly switch 
allegiances between AMD and NVIDIA 
and even hardline partisans who are simply 
upgrading their drivers to a newer version. 
Put simply, we’ve been dealing with pesky 
driver issues for ages; we’ll continue to 
deal with pesky driver issues, so why create 
more problems by leaving behind old 
driver fragments?
If you know your graphics card and its 
drivers are running flawlessly, we suggest 
leaving them alone. However, as long as 
you’re clearing space on your PC, consider 
sprucing up your display-driver situation. 
The aptly named Display Driver Uninstaller 
will take care of this bit of business. DDU, 
as it’s commonly known in enthusiast circles, 
is a good choice if you’re looking for a clean 
memory footprint, and straightforward 
presentation of information.
After you’ve downloaded, installed, 
and launched WinDirStat, it immediately 
presents you with a dialog box that lists 
the drives in your system. Select the 
drive you want to scan and click OK. 
WinDirStat isn’t the swiftest program 
on the planet, particularly if you put it 
to work on a gigantic hard 
drive that’s filled to the brim, 
but the end result is worth 
the wait. Once WinDirStat 
finishes analyzing your drive, it 
displays all the files as a massive 
psychedelic grid, where files 
are represented as blocks sized 
according to how much space 
they take up relative to every 
other file on the drive.
Start your hunt in the 
bottom WinDirStat pane. Of 
course you’ll want to look for 
the biggest blocks to make the 
most impact. When you click 
a block in the bottom pane, 
WinDirStat automatically 
navigates to and selects the 
associated file in the top-left 
pane. Right-click the selected 
file for a context menu of 
actions WinDirStat can perform. It can 
send a file to the Recycle Bin or delete it 
straightaway. Or, if you’d like to take a 
closer look before scouring it from your 
system, WinDirStat can open the file 
in Explorer.
WinDirStat is a great tool because 
it tends to find big files you might have 
otherwise missed. For example, we scanned 
an old laptop and found a pair of outdated 
iPhone backups that together amounted 
to slightly more than 12GB. After hop-
scotching across our grid, we were able to 
identify plenty of other big files collecting 
digital dust on our drive, and deleting them 
with WinDirStat was a cinch. 
In some instances, WinDirStat can also 
locate batches of small files you want to get 
rid of. In its top-right pane, WinDirStat 
lumps the scanned drive’s files together by 
format and then sorts them according to 
which files add up to the most capacity on 
Display Driver Uninstaller, or DDU, might solve your display driver situation.

Inside The World Of Betas
torrenting via WebTorrent for its most heavily 
accessed content. Sure seems like an easier 
solution than mailing Jimmy Wales a check 
for $5, doesn’t it?
Clearly, WebTorrent is bursting with 
promise. Go ahead and grab the desktop 
client to see if it meets your torrenting 
needs, and definitely keep an eye on the 
WebTorrent project. ■
WebTorrent’s claim to fame is that it’s the 
first torrent client capable of streaming directly 
within a browser. For a better understanding 
of how profound that is, consider an example 
like Wikipedia. As the sixth most trafficked 
website in the world (and the top non-
profit site), Wikipedia’s bandwidth needs are 
enormous. Now, instead of panhandling you 
for donations, Wikipedia can use peer-to-peer 
F
orgive us, but we’re going to lead off 
this month with a bit of the ol’ bait and 
switch. WebTorrent Desktop is definitely 
a slick way to stream a variety of torrents. 
(The project mentions videos from the 
Internet Archive and Librivox audiobooks 
as a couple of examples.) That being said, 
there is no shortage of software capable of 
playing torrented content. We’re a lot more 
interested in WebTorrent itself and the 
potential it has for the future of the web.
The peer-to-peer power of BitTorrent has 
always felt much greater than the ability to 
pirate episodes of “Westworld.” As the Internet 
continues to expand and websites load up 
on hi-def video, we’ll need ways to more 
efficiently shuttle all that content through the 
series of tubes to our PCs. Bandwidth needs 
will go up, not down, and sites have to figure 
out how to cope. WebTorrent, for its part, 
could be the solution that helps everyone, 
whether client side or server side.

Upgrades That’ll Keep You Humming Along
Keeping your PC and its data safe is a never-ending job, but somebody (read: you) has to do it. You deserve a 
little R&R, though, so we found some software updates that cover all those bases and more. If you have an MSI 
Z270 motherboard, it might be time for a BIOS update. 
Foundation was busy beta-testing its FOSS 
media center software late last year. This year, 
the build formerly known as “Krypton” is 
live and sporting a brand-new look—or 
rather, looks. Kodi’s default skin, Estuary, is 
specifically designed as a 10-foot interface; 
Estouchy covers anyone using Kodi on a 
touchscreen device.  Elsewhere, Kodi receives 
tweaks and improvements to many of its 
core features, such as a rewritten video engine 
and an overhauled Live TV and PVR. With 
the version 17.0 release, Kodi comes to the 
Windows Store, as well.

Ryder In The Sky
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
BioWare   •   www.masseffect.com
As BioWare’s most beloved tent-pole franchise, Mass Effect has always 
been about maximizing player choice. These games are all third-person 
RPG space operas, but practically everything else, from the looks and 
gender of your player character to the romantic encounters, dialog choices, 
and responses to a multitude of ethical quandaries, are yours to decide. 
Aside from the universe and a handful of returning alien races, the new game 
has little in common with the trilogy. To recap, humans are newcomers to 
the exclusive club of space-faring bipeds, but thanks to the discovery of 
Prothean technology on Mars, our species develops faster-than-light space 
travel. Two years after Commander Shepard takes the helm of the Normandy 
in the original game, the Andromeda Initiative completes the construction 
of a series of massive Arks designed to transport 100,000 Turian, Asari, 
Salarian, Quarian, and human cryopods on a 25-million-light-year journey to 
the Andromeda Galaxy. More than 600 years later, humanity’s Hyperion Ark 
is the only one that arrives, and it’s late. To make matters worse, the “Golden 
Worlds” planets have become uninhabitable thanks to a deadly energy matrix 
referred to as The Scourge and an ongoing threat from the blood-thirsty Kett. 
I chose Sara Ryder as my player character, the daughter of Alec Ryder, 
the Pathfinder tasked with exploring worlds, scouting for colonial outpost 
locations, and making first contact with aliens. As events unfolded, I 
was immediately reminded of the previous games. The synth-heavy 
soundtrack is back, and it’s fantastic. The Paragon/Renegade dialog 
response system is gone in favor of a more organic set of responses, but 
often you’re left having to choose between the cliché or silly response. 
The writing, both from a dialog and characterization perspective, seems 
to have dropped off considerably compared to the previous games. 
As before, you’re constantly being pelted with missions. One of my biggest 
gripes with ME:A, however, is that you can only have one task active at 
a time, and rarely do markers appear to indicate the presence of nearby 
inactive mission objectives. Exploring a planet without an objective marker 
to lead you in the right direction can disrupt the linear narrative. I managed 
to exchange mission details with an NPC on Eos but never got an updated 
mission marker because I wasn’t supposed to access that part of the 
map yet. Another disruption came when I encountered a massive flying 
mechanical tripod called an Architect on the ice planet Voeld. There was 
no explanation, just my squad mates essentially saying, “look, another 
one!” Back on Eos, the first planet you unlock, I met another Architect, 
but this time I got the cinematic intro and the accompanying explanation. 
Other gripes include too many recycled character animations, an inability 
to command squad mates in battle, a cast of mostly one-dimensional 
characters, and bland side missions. So much of what doesn’t work well 
comes down to polish. This game feels like it was rushed out the door. 
ME:A has potential. The Andromeda Initiative’s colonial ambitions are a 
perfect lens to view humanity’s strengths and weaknesses. The combat 
mechanics are light years better, the Nomad is incredibly fun to drive, 
and the Tempest is every bit as cool as the Normandy. Despite my many 
qualms, the previous games kept me coming back because of unequalled 
dialog and stellar characters. ME:A resolves many of my quibbles with the 
franchise, but it falters when it comes to compelling dialog and characters. 
Maybe if the internet complains enough, Bioware will patch those in. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do,

Strikes & Gutters
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
Ubisoft   •   ghost-recon.ubisoft.com
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands puts you in the role of a 
disavowed U.S. commando taking on a Mexican drug cartel that 
has chosen Bolivia—yes, the entire country—as its new base of 
operations. The game feels a lot like a hybrid of two of Ubisoft’s 
other properties, Far Cry and Tom Clancy’s The Division. Like Far Cry, 
the game turns you loose in a massive world with a nice variety of 
environments and hosts of NPCs, including Bolivian civilians, local 
military forces, and of course members of the Santa Blanca cartel. Like 
The Division, Wildlands is a third-person shooter, albeit with a first-
person aiming mode you can use when needed, and there’s a lot of 
emphasis on playing as a member of a squad. 
Wildlands borrows some of the best aspects of both games, and Ubisoft 
has done an incredible job of building an in-game Bolivia. The game’s 
world is fully explorable, and it’s so scenic and well-made that you will 
want to explore; this is a big plus.
It’s also nice that the game provides lots of kinds of missions and 
activities for your commandos to undertake; you’ll engage in seek-and-
destroy missions, gather intel, rescue hostages, steal stuff from the cartel 
to hand over to the local resistance, and more, and you’ll get around 
in a myriad of vehicles, including everything from dirt bikes to massive 
helicopters, and they are nearly all fun to drive or fly. Wildlands lets you 
fast-travel to bases and other points of interest in order to get around the 
huge map quickly, but I often found myself grabbing a chopper or SUV 
and getting around the old-fashioned way, just for the fun of it.
Ubisoft also provides three AI teammates that you can play through the 
entire game with if it suits you, although they aren’t perfect (more on 
this in a sec). If you would rather play with friends, you can do so, and 
as with The Division, your friends can join and drop out of your squad 
seamlessly at any point; you can also jump into an online co-op game 
with randos if you want, but in these instances you don’t get voice chat, 
which (as you can imagine) is kind of a problem when you’re trying to 
coordinate a covert strike on a Bolivian army base. 
The game presents two other pretty big problems: First, what initially 
seems like a vast world of interesting possibilities quickly boils down to 
an increasingly repetitive set of the same kinds of activities. The variety 
in terrain and situations helps ameliorate this a bit, but by the 10th or 
12th time you hijack a supply convoy, it starts to get a little stale. Second, 
your AI squad mates are helpful and can have a meaningful impact in 
combat, but they also have a tendency to get lost from time to time, they 
have a hard time following orders, and they chatter incessantly between 
missions. Their chatter is also incredibly repetitive and becomes actively 
aggravating when they try to talk over the few snippets of mission 
briefings and other important audio the game offers.
Other weird squad issues include the fact that you can jump in an 
SUV or helicopter and take off immediately, leaving your mates 
behind, but within a few seconds they’ll appear in your vehicle 
anyway, as if by magic.
Luckily, Wildlands’ combat is pretty good, which helps overcome some 
of the game’s annoyances. Also, the ability to mark enemy targets with 
your drone, binoculars, or rifle scope and have your AI team take them 
out at your signal somewhat counters the things they do that detract 
from the fun.
On balance, Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands is fun to play, and the 
ability to have your friends jump in and out of your game as need be 
is a plus. If third-person Far Cry with your pals (or The Division without 
stat min-maxing and bullet-sponge bosses) sounds fun to you, it’s 
probably worth giving this game a shot. ■

A Sharp-Tongued Sneakquel
BY VINCE COGLEY
$39.99 (PC); $49.99 (XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature     
Focus Home Interactive   •   www.styx-game.com
Stealth fans have enjoyed a bountiful year of games that require you to 
slink through levels and quietly dispatch your enemies. A little over a year 
ago, Square Enix gave us its episodic reboot of the HITMAN franchise. 
Last month, we played (and enjoyed) the fourth installment of Rebellion’s 
World War II era sneak-and-snipe game Sniper Elite 4. We haven’t had 
a chance to play Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, but by most 
accounts the samurai stealther is a can’t-miss experience. And of course, 
Dishonored 2 claimed CPU’s Game of the Year crown.
This month, Focus Home Interactive released Styx: Shards of Darkness, the 
follow-up to 2014’s Styx: Master of Shadows. Shards is actually the third 
game in French developer Cyanide Studios’ Of Orcs and Men universe, but 
Cyanide has ditched the action RPG elements of the first game to focus 
solely on the titular goblin and his more subtle approach to killing. 
Before we dive into the game itself, we have to discuss our larger-than-
life-yet-smaller-than-a-seven-year-old antihero. Styx is surly and sassy 
and has an ogre-sized chip on his shoulder, but if you know anything about 
his origin story from Master of Shadows, you’ll cut him some slack. Less 
appealing, however, is how Cyanide writes its irascible and irreverent 
goblin. Styx’s frequent fourth wall breaks are somewhat jarring, not really 
because the trope is relatively rare in the fantasy genre but rather because 
the rest of Styx’s world plays it so straight. When everyone else in the 
game sticks to the script while Styx is riffing on pizza (yes, really) and 
the Terminator (also really), it really spoils the ambience, like wearing a 
Christmas sweater to a funeral.
We’ll level with you: We could’ve pardoned Shards 
of Darkness for its out-of-place joke delivery if the 
jokes themselves had been genuinely amusing. 
We’re not ashamed to enjoy low-brow humor 
every now and then, but really good ribaldry 
requires an artist’s touch. Instead of taking the 
time to get the bawdy humor right, Cyanide goes 
straight for the bottom shelf, whipping out one-
liners you can hear from every eighth-grader who 
thinks he’s the next Daniel Tosh. This isn’t the first 
Shards review to make the following observation, 
but it’s almost as if Cyanide thought making 
Deadpool a goblin and putting him in “Lord of the 
Rings” would be a slam dunk by default. In reality, 
the end result is a brick. 
The reason why we’ve spilled so much ink on Styx and his cringe-
inducing “comedy” is that Shards of Darkness is an otherwise decent 
game. Many stealth games, Dishonored included, have tipped toward 
“action stealth,” giving their protagonists godlike powers to lay waste 
to their foes if discovered. On the whole, Shards of Darkness stays 
faithful to a true stealth experience. Discovery regularly leads to death, 
even at the game’s lower difficulty settings. You do have a tech tree to 
upgrade Styx’s tricks, but they’re not geared toward making the goblin an 
unstoppable killing machine in open combat.
We also liked several of Shards of Darkness’ mechanics. Styx is able to 
clone himself, and the clone can then do things like create distractions 
and lure guards away from their posts while Styx sneaks in unscathed. 
Upgraded, it’s probably the coolest and most original ability in the game. 
Another nifty skill is Amber Vision, which displays guards’ line of sight and 
also highlights collectible items and other objects Styx can interact with. 
We appreciate Cyanide’s commitment to making Styx more powerful by 
making him harder to find rather than harder to stop.
Shards of Darkness’ levels are decent enough, even if the camera and 
platforming elements aren’t as sharp as they could be. Its story works 
insofar as it keeps you moving through the game without being a drag, 
which brings us back to Shards of Darkness’ central problem: the main 
character. Styx wears his irredeemably awful behavior as a badge of honor, 
but we saw it as a scarlet letter. For as hard as Styx works to sabotage his 
enemies, the only thing he really manages to sabotage is his own game. ■

Q&A With Joshua Pearce
3D Printers In The Average 
American Household
the kind of patented fused deposition 
modeling where you’re taking filament and 
laying down layers to build up a 3D-printed 
object—had its patents expire. So the 
RepRap Project, instead of continuing on 
with another patent, realized it was kind of 
stupid because anyone who bought one of 
its printers could immediately start to make 
a second one on their own. There was no real 
way to stop that, so RepRap open-sourced it. 
A University of Bath professor and team 
spread it all throughout the world trying to 
create these 3D printers that could make 
themselves and open-sourced it. When I 
saw that I salivated. It was very clear this 
was going to be huge. So we started in on 
it very hard in our group. We started doing 
prototyping like everyone else at the time, 
but then we quickly realized that we could 
use it to do manufacturing of our own 
scientific tools, which we could then open-
source and have this kind of distributed 
manufacturing paradigm for sharing 
scientific tools. 
going to cost us this much to do” because 
were weren’t mass manufacturing. The 
whole idea was for people to kind of make 
it themselves. So we started looking around 
for some way to do prototyping without 
draining the bank account. 
I came across the RepRap project. RepRap 
stands for self-replicating rapid prototypers. 
It’s 3D printers that print themselves. It just 
so happens that around that time, FDM—
Q
: Essentially, the results of your recent 
study suggest average American 
consumers can not only save considerable 
money using a 3D printer in the home 
but also see a substantial return on their 
investment. What motivated this study, 
and was it actually a continuation of 
research you started in 2013 on this topic? 
JP
: In fact, it probably even goes a 
little further back than that. It goes 
all the way back to when I really started to 
become interested in 3D printing. We were 
doing prototypes for solar-powered laptops 
for the developing world. I was finally a 
professor, and I finally had access to an 
actual Rapid prototyper. I was so excited. 
The students had done these really cool 
designs, and then we went to go get them 
prototyped. The prototypes just made of 
simple plastic cost more than the whole 
solar system and almost as much as the 
computer. It was kind of like, “This is never 
going to work in the developing world if it’s 
Joshua Pearce, an associate professor at Michigan Technological University, has for years conducted research into open 
sustainability technologies, or the “application of science and innovation to ensure a better quality of life for all.” Among other
things, this has involved exploring the economic and environmental benefits of using open-source 3D printers. Pearce’s lab has 
long known it can considerably reduce the costs of obtaining high-end scientific equipment by 3D printing its own, but Pearce 
wanted to explore if average American consumers—even those lacking 3D-printing experience—could see similar benefits by 
3D printing common household items such as smartphone cases, shower heads, and camera lens covers in the home. 
For a recent study, Pearce directed an undergraduate student with no 3D-printing experience to configure a LulzBot Mini 
printer and locate and download free 3D print files for 26 common household items that she then printed. Pearce ran an 
economic analysis that took into account the cost to buy the 3D printer and operate it over a year’s time under the assumption 
a household would print one item on average per week. He compared this to low- and high-cost estimates for store-bought 
equivalents for each item. Against the low-cost estimates, Pearce found 3D printing resulted in 93% savings for consumers. 
Against high-cost estimates, savings reached 98.65%. Pearce also found that with the low-cost estimates, the 3D printer would 
pay for itself and all related printing costs in three years. Consumers, however, would see a 100% return on their 3D-printing 
investment after five years. With the high-cost estimates, the printer pays for itself after just six months and generates 
$12,000-plus in savings after five years. We spoke with Pearce about the study, the potential of 3D printers, and more.

printers to print out many of its parts. 
The most likely parts to fail are also 3D 
printable, so you could print upgrades or 
replacement parts. Keeping these things 
alive for five years is a very conservative, 
reasonable assumption. 
To calculate the return on investment, 
we looked at that cost that you’d put in 
for electricity and plastic and purchased 
the printer as an investment the same 
way as if you would buy stock on the 
stock market. Then we counted up all 
the savings you get over that year. So for 
each product that was printed, we had a 
high and low estimate. The low estimate 
was the cheapest equivalent we could 
find on the web or close to it. The high 
estimate was one that was a little bit more 
close to the actual object. So if it was 
a specific type of, say, lens cover for a 
specific camera, it had to be this. It just 
wasn’t good enough to get a generic one. 
You had to get the exact measurements 
right. So, for things like that, that’s where 
you got very high numbers. From a return 
on investment for the kind of low-end 
side, you’re on the orders of hundreds, 
and if you go to the high-end side, you’re 
looking at almost a 1,000% return on 
your investment. 
Q
: Were the ROI numbers you 
calculated after the study in line 
with your expectations prior to starting 
the study?

: They were sort of within reason. 
They are nowhere near as high 
as if you printed medical or scientific 
equipment, and it’s still fairly conservative 
because printing one thing a week really 
isn’t that much. If you really think about 
it, if you have kids and you go to birthday 
parties, you could basically pay for the 
3D printer just on offset toy purchases. 
It really depends on how much you use 
it and what your normal consumer-
purchasing habits are. That’s why we got 
a very eclectic collection of 3D-printed 
objects, because we were trying to get to a 
place where hopefully every person would 
see at least one thing on the list that they 
might want or normally purchase. 
like the large-scale multimillion dollar ones 
working at NASA, but she had never used 
one. She didn’t know anything. I handed 
her the printer with no instructions and 
said, “I want you to print out 26 things you 
think a normal person might want. Go.” 
And this is what we came up with.  
Q
: Can you talk about the savings 
and ROI figures you arrived at with 
the study? 
JP
: The way we did it was we 
monitored the electricity used for 
the 3D printer and the plastic used. As of 
right now, the plastic is by far the dominant 
expense for operating a 3D printer. But 
everything we printed for this study was 
done on less than $20 worth of plastic, so 
even though it’s the dominant expense, 
it’s still not that expensive. The reason we 
included the electricity is that in the future, 
it’s my very strong estimate that the price of 
filament is going to continue to decrease. 
For example, we did everything in PLA 
[polylactic acid]. The average cost of PLA 
filament, sort of what people are buying 
on Amazon, is around $24 per kilogram. 
I know you can buy small batches of PLA 
pellets for $5 a kilogram, and if you buy 
large batches, it goes down to around $1 
a kilogram. So there’s a lot of space left to 
squeeze the profit margins out of filament 
manufacturers. That eventually will happen 
more and more as 3D printing scales. 
When it does happen, then the cost 
of electricity actually starts to matter a 
little bit. Right now, it’s on the order of 
tens of cents depending on where you 
live vs. dollars for the filament. We 
calculated the cost of the printer to buy 
it and the cost to operate the printer 
over an entire year, assuming you’d print 
one thing on average per week, and we 
used the size of the things we selected 
for those 26 items to be representative. 
So, we took the average size, the average 
printing time, the average filament, and 
the average electricity used, and that got 
us a cost to operate the printer for a year. 
Because these 3D printers are RepRap-
style printers, the company that makes 
the one that we used literally uses its own 
We were doing that for a while, and if 
you know anything about scientific tools, 
you know they are highly overpriced. 
There’s a small market for them. They aren’t 
generally mass produced. So you’re buying 
thousands of dollars of items that do very, 
very simple things. We found that we could 
3D print most things we needed in our lab 
to do solar research and save thousands and 
tens of thousands of dollars for each item we 
were printing. The economic justification 
for doing 3D printing was crystal clear 
to us. Literally right now, I’m printing 
something in my office on a $2,000 printer, 
and the object that I’m printing is $1,000. 
By the end of the day, I’ll have paid for half 
of the printer just for one thing I need. We 
wanted to sort of continue that thought and 
look at normal consumers. 
Back in 2013, we said, “What if the 
normal, everyday consumer looked at the 
free plans for RepRap on the internet, 
downloaded them, and built her own 
printer? Would that justify itself economically 
for printing out normal things a consumer 
would need and not scientific tools or 
medical tools?” Those printers cost $500, 
and the results we saw were very encouraging. 
It was fairly easy for the normal American 
consumer to pay for the printer, to 
economically justify it again using that same 
kind of assumption that you wouldn’t be 
printing constantly, but maybe one time a 
week to make it worthwhile. 
That study was relatively well-received. I 
think it started to open up a lot of people’s 
eyes that maybe all the hype about 3D 
printing actually had some foundation to 
it, that economics might push this in the 
future. But I would say one of the really 
strong criticisms of the study was that we 
were assuming the American public was 
technologically savvy enough to build its 
own printer. I’ve run a class for years where 
I have engineering students do that, but 
they are engineering students, and they’re 
highly motivated and they’re self-selected 
as people who are interested in additive 
manufacturing, so that was a fair critique. 
With this new study, I put that critique to 
the test. I took a second-year undergraduate 
student who had never taken my 3D 
printing class. She’d seen some 3D printers,

JP
: The RecycleBot is a waste-plastic 
extruder. Again, going back several 
years because we were focusing on the 
developing world and we were chewing 
through plastic like crazy in our lab 
and it was kind of expensive, we asked 
if there was a less-expensive way to get 
3D-printable plastic. We started off by 
just recycling our own prints. You could 
grind them up and put them in this device 
that would extrude filament, and then you 
could print with it and that was pretty 
easy. Then we started looking at other 
things. The first one we tried was HDPE 
[high-density polyethylene], which is the 
plastic of milk jugs and containers for 
dishwasher soap and detergent and things 
like that. And it worked. We were able to 
make filament for less than 10 cents per 
kilogram, where that cost of filament was 
basically the cost of electricity to run the 
RecycleBot. It was pretty exciting, and we 
did some interesting stuff with it here, and 
it started to spread. 
Now, I’d say there’s something like a 
dozen manufacturers of something like the 
RecycleBot. They might be just selling it 
to extrude virgin pellets into filament, but 
you could just as easily take bad prints, 
old plastic food containers or whatever, 
clean them off, dry them up, shred them 
up, and stick them in. When we first 
started, we were using an office shredder 
to literally shred waste plastic from my 
lab group and turn it back into filament. 
At this point now, there have been dozens 
of open-source hacks on different types of 
RecycleBots. There are automated spoolers. 
There are all kinds of wonderful things 
happening. The RecycleBot technology 
is a little behind where the 3D-printing 
technology is right now, but in a couple 
of years, it will be ready for showtime, 
and you will have the option of if you 
finish your orange juice in the morning, 
you rinse out the bottle, dry it, throw 
it through a small shredder, and turn it 
back into filament. Then you can make 
whatever products you happen to want. 
That’s when no one can compete with 
those costs. You can’t even get recycled 
filament for the cost you could make it for 
yourself in your own house. ■
probably a lot more than that. If you’re 
looking at something like the Barrel of 
Monkeys game where you have a bunch 
of little monkeys, users probably printed 
more than one monkey, but we assumed 
everyone printed one of each thing. 
Just making that assumption with just 
those 26 items, we know the 3D-printing 
community in the world has saved about 
$4 million just on those 26 items already. 
The exact number isn’t important, but the 
idea is that people are beginning to use 3D 
printers not just for prototyping but for 
actually making consumer products for 
themselves. And that’s really surprising and 
shocking—that we’ve already started to 
move toward a distributed manufacturing 
paradigm, which I don’t think anyone 
thought was coming this fast. 
Q
: Can you talk about the RecycleBot 
and the value it brings to 3D 
printing, including in terms of reducing 
waste, cutting costs, and more? 
The thing that surprised me was the 
next calculation. Most of the websites 
that have free repositories of 3D-printable 
designs also keep track of how many times 
a design is downloaded. The reason they 
do that is to encourage designers to share 
their things. It’s kind of like an ego boost 
to see something you’ve made downloaded 
a hundred or thousands of times and that 
people are using it all over the world. It’s 
kind of fun for people and a way to kind 
of share back with people who have shared 
things with you in the past. 
We have the download statistics of 
the 26 items that we looked at. We 
knew approximately how much a 3D 
operator would save by printing one of 
these objects, and we assumed they 
just downloaded it and printed it once, 
and this again is a fairly conservative 
assumption. It’s sort of like an MP3 you 
can download from the web. You can 
assume everyone who downloaded an MP3 
probably listened to it at least once but 
In a recent experiment, Joshua Pearce, an associate professor at Michigan Technological University, asked 
an undergraduate student with no 3D-printing experience to configure a LulzBot Mini printer such as the one 
shown here and then locate, download, and print the free 3D print files for 26 common household items.

Q&A With Ryan “OpTic J” Musselman
OpTic Gaming Co-Founder 
On How It All Started
content, and curate relationships. Scuf 
Gaming was very supportive, like always, 
in helping us acquire our current CoD 
house, and as you can see from the many 
videos, it’s served as the main stage for 
our media efforts.
Q
: OpTic Gaming of course has 
several teams based on various 
games the organization competes in. 
When do you know that a new game 
warrants consideration for its own team?
RM
: There’s no ultimate formula 
so far, but the big indicators 
for us to consider expanding usually 
start with active community support: 
Is there an audience? Do they love it? 
Is there a steady and consistent rate 
of adoption? Next up is development: 
Is it built for competition? Does the 
developing company understand eSports? 
Is there an established infrastructure 
to continue to enhance the game for 
eSports? We also have to consider 
developer support: Is there an official 
league or commitment to work with 
an organization that runs leagues? Are 
tournament earnings large enough to 
attract top talent and justify the time 
and resources needed to becoming 
a professional? These things are just a 
starting point. It’s very difficult for new 
games to spawn into fully supported and 
well-rounded eSports. 
Q
: At this point, eSports is clearly 
more than a fad. When you started 
OpTic, did you foresee eSports getting as 
big as it has?
RM
: When we started OpTic, it 
was more about friends getting 
together after school and work to 
improve our craft and play for the love of 
Q
: Who was your first team sponsor, 
and how did you get that lined up?
RM
: Our first team sponsor was a 
competitive gaming website that is 
no longer in existence, known as NxGamers.
com. They saw the early traction Gamebattles.
com was achieving and ultimately wanted to 
compete. It’s unfortunate it didn’t work out, 
but we truly enjoyed our time with them. 
The sponsorship came about through the 
development of online relationships in forums 
and Xbox Live. In fact, we can attribute a 
lot of our OpTic friendships to Xbox Live 
and various online forums. If NxGamers.com 
was not our sponsor, we would not have met 
H3CZ . . . he was a referee on the site and 
quickly became a friend of OpTic because he 
was always available to help. 
Q
: Does OpTic have a home base where 
team members live and practice?
RM
: We have two large houses for 
professional players and content 
producers to practice, live-stream, create 
Q
: When did you start OpTic 
Gaming, and how did you decide 
to start an eSports team?
RM
: OpTic was born in 2006, 
and the original intent was to 
compete online, primarily as a pick-up 
team who played together after work 
and school. The eSports scene for Call of 
Duty, our first eSport, was in its infancy. 
You would only find tournaments online, 
and it was mainly for bragging rights. 
In 2009, H3CZ [Hector “H3CZ” 
Rodriguez] and his brother started 
creating content, leading to a strong fan 
base and ultimately creating a desire to 
expand into eSports given that CoD was 
on the rise. 2010 became the year our 
professional CoD team first competed 
at a LAN, although in 2007 H3CZ and I 
competed at a small event in Florida (we 
placed third). 
Q
: What was the first thing you did to get 
the team rolling and make it official?
RM
: Overall, it was truly paying 
attention to the eSports space: how 
it was developing, who the notable players 
were, how the up-and-comers were breaking 
into the scene, and so on. This is a mission 
and practice that will be core for generations 
to come, just as it is in traditional sports today. 
Q
: Can you talk about the process of 
recruiting players? How did you go 
about finding people to recruit to the 
team, and what kind of tryouts/auditions/
interviews did you have?
RM
: Gamebattles.com was a strong 
source for player recruitment. It 
essentially was our virtual database for 
tracking teams and players and getting to 
know who was on the rise.
86 April2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

of eSports, yet remained positive, 
hopeful, and active in helping it grow. 
Core to the development of OpTic is 
our commitment to support exponential 
eSports growth. 
Q
: What’s the over/under on years until 
eSports events outsell traditional 
sporting events?
RM
: I don’t have a specific num-
ber, but to speak in terms 
of numbers, we’re already seeing the 
beginnings of this trend. There have been 
multiple articles over the past few years 
that show how League of Legends and 
Dota 2 have surpassed viewership over 
the World Series, BCS, and the NBA 
finals. It’s not only impressive, but a 
true testament to the growing power of 
the supporting mediums like YouTube, 
Twitch, and more.
Q
: What’s your proudest moment as a 
co-founder of OpTic Gaming?
RM
: It’s a combination of two 
milestones. First, seeing the 
success of my friend Hector as he took 
something so raw in its early days and 
turned it into an organization with an 
incredible following. Hector and I met 
through competition on Xbox Live 11 
years ago, and it was an honor to have 
him as one of my groomsmen when I got 
married in 2015. It’s a testament to the 
unique relationships people are building 
in eSports. He is someone I have come 
to respect and has a hilarious personality 
that is so perfect for the gaming scene. 
Coupled with that, officially coming 
onboard in a full-time capacity to team 
with Hector on developing OpTic for 
future success and opportunity. I’m sorry, 
I can’t just do one moment—there are 
three—but I feel they all sync. In 2010 
at MLG Dallas, the term “Green Wall” 
was coined in response to a host of fans 
and OpTic members all wearing green, 
standing behind our players yelling 
loudly as they competed. That was my 
first MLG event, and to this day, it 
remains my favorite. ■
of our organization, from competition 
to content creation. That said, I don’t 
think we really knew the full potential 
the game, as well as the competition. To 
this day, that core foundation still rings 
true, and I see it played out in all aspects 
OpTic Sponsor DXRacer:
What We Look For In An eSports Team
Ever wonder how gaming gear companies 
choose the teams they sponsor? We did, too, 
so DXRacer’s Dan Leshock told us.
Q:How many gaming teams/organizations does 
DXRacer have formal relationships with?
DL: Our eSport presence is quite impressive, 
with over 30 organizations under our banner! 
We pride ourselves on partnering with the best 
teams in eSports.
Q: What kinds of things does your company do 
for eSports teams as part of its sponsorship agreements?
DL: Aside from supporting the team financially, DXRacer has a wide array of benefits for being under our 
banner, such as streaming opportunities on the DXRacer Twitch page, invitations to attend events with 
DXRacer, and quarterly activations on social media. However, one of the coolest perks that we provide to 
teams is the creation of their own custom chair. These are used to outfit their homes and streams, as well 
as an additional merchandise item for the community. It is a cool way to solidify and push the partnership. 
Q: Do teams come to you and ask for sponsorship, or do you scout out teams to offer sponsorships to?
DL:It really is a mixture of the two. Many teams reach out directly, but we also scout around and keep 
tabs on specific teams. Part of my position at DXRacer involves analyzing upcoming games and where the 
company will want to have a presence. From there, we find teams that can fit that role and more.
Q: What criteria do you use when deciding whether to sponsor a gaming team, and how much weight 
does each factor carry?
DL:While team inquiries are handled on a case-by-case basis, we like to focus on three major factors for 
any evaluation: community size and growth, the games they play and their North American/global ranking 
for them, and their ability to push the partnership for both themselves and DXRacer. Each of these pieces 
creates the groundwork for team evaluation and holds equal weight on how we assess an inquiry. 
Q: What’s the best advice you have to offer teams that are out there right now looking for sponsors?
DL:Unique offerings are key. As sponsorships develop out in the space, they require more time and 
dedication from the team to make it stand out against the crowd. Be open to unique activations that 
are not typical of other teams. Continually innovate your processes and bring ideas on how to push the 
sponsor’s brand further, while bringing overall benefits to your organization. And finally, always have a nice 
presentation ready for anyone you talk to!
