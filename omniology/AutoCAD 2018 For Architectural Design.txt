Tutorial 3: Creating Layers 
Layers are very important for grouping objects in a drawing. They are like a group of transparent sheets that are 
combined into a complete drawing. The figure below displays a drawing consisting of object lines and dimension 
lines. In this example, the object lines are created on the ‘Object’ layer, and dimensions are created on the layer 
called ‘Dimension’. You can easily turn-off the ‘Dimension’ layer for a clearer view of the object lines. 
 
You can assign properties such as name, color, line weight (thickness), and linetype to a layer. The properties can 
vary for each layer. 
 
 
Open the Tutorial 1 file, if not already opened. 
 
On the ribbon, click Home tab > Layers panel > Layer Properties
. 
 
On the Layer Properties Manager, click New Layer icon located at the top left corner. Type A-WALL in 
the Name box, and press Enter. 
 

 
16 AutoCAD 2018 For Architectural Design 
 
 
 
 
The naming framework for layers according to United States National CAD standards is shown below. 
 
 
 
On the Layer Properties Manager, click the square in the Color column of the A-WALL row. 
 
 
 
On the Select Color dialog, select the Cyan (4) from the Index color section. Click OK. 
 
 
 

 
17 AutoCAD 2018 For Architectural Design 
 
 
The color assigned to a layer will determine the lineweight (line thickness) of the object when you print the 
drawing. This condition is valid only when you use color-dependent plot style. However, you can define your 
own lineweight if you use a Named plot style. You can set lineweights for each color. The lineweights for 
different colors in this example are given below. 
 
Color 
Lineweight 
Color 9 
0.05 mm 
Color 8 
0.09 mm 
Red 
0.1 mm 
Yellow 
0.2 mm 
Green 
0.4 mm 
Cyan 
0.5 mm 
Blue 
0.7 mm 
Magenta 
1.0 mm 
 
 
Create a new layer called A-GRID and assign the Index color 9 to it. 
 
On the Layer Properties Manager, click in the Linetype column of the A-GRID row.  
 
 
Click the Load button on the Select Linetype dialog. On the Load or Reload Linetypes dialog, select the 
DASHED linetype from the Available Linetypes list. Click OK.  
 
 
 

 
18 AutoCAD 2018 For Architectural Design 
 
 


symbol on the top left/right corner. 
 
 
 
 
Select the two image references and click Home tab > Layers panel > Layer drop-down > References on 
the ribbon. The images are moved to the References layer. You can Turn OFF/ON the image references 
by clicking the bulb icon of the References layer in the Layer drop-down.

base points. 
 
 
 
 
 
Tutorial 4: Creating Grid Lines 
Creating grid lines is a good starting point of an architectural design. They help you to create components of the 
architectural drawing easily and accurately. Now, you will create gird lines on the A-GRID layer. 
 


upward. The length of the line is reduced.  
 
Likewise, drag down the upper end point grip to shorten the grid line, as shown. 
 
 
Type L and press Enter. Select a point on the extreme right grid line, as shown. Move the pointer toward 
left and click outside the image. Press Esc to deactivate the Line command. 

 
23 AutoCAD 2018 For Architectural Design

 
Add Appearances and Textures to the model 
 
Apply Backgrounds and Scenes to the model 
 
Add Cameras and Lights 
 
Render Images 
 
Tutorial 1: Adding Materials 
Adding materials is the first step of the rendering a scene. Materials when applied appropriately will give a 
realistic appearance to the model. In this tutorial, you will add materials to the 3D model. Before starting this 
tutorial, you need to make sure that the Autodesk material library is installed on your computer. 
 
 
Open the 3D-Modeling.dwg file.  
 
Hide all the layers related to the Elevations and floor plans. 
 
On the ribbon, click Visualize tab > Materials panel > Material Browser
. The Material Browser palette 
appears. It is divided into two portions: Document Materials and Libraries. The upper portion is called 
Document Materials and displays the materials used in the current document. The Libraries portion shows 
materials available in various libraries. By default, the Favorites and Autodesk Library are available in this 
portion. You can open existing libraries or create new one using the 
drop-down available at the bottom of 
the palette. 
 
On the Material Browser, click the Changes your views 
 drop-down in the Document Materials portion 
and select Thumbnail View. Likewise, change the view in the Libraries portion to Thumbnail View.

Tutorial 3: Adding Lights 
AutoCAD has a default lighting system in the model space. However, you can add new lights to the model. 
AutoCAD allows you to create four types of lights.  Note that you need to turn off the default lighting to view the 
effect of the user-defined lights. To do so, expand the Lights panel and deactivate the Default Lighting 
icon. 
These lights are discussed next. 
 
Point Light: The point light emits light in all directions from the location.  
 
 
Spot light: Spot lights are similar to the directional lights. However, they create brighter and sharp lights 
targeting a specific area. 
 
Distant Light: The distance light emits light rays which are parallel to each other. 
 
Weblight:  Weblight can be used to create lights based on the data from the light manufacturers. This gives a 
precise output similar to the real world lights. The data from the light manufacturers is provided in the IES 
format. The system computes the luminous intensity and direction of light using the data. 
 
 
Select View Controls > Top from the In-Canvas controls. 
 
On the Visualize tab of the ribbon, expand the Lights panel and deactivate the Default Lighting 
tool.
