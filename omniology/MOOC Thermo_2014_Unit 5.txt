Unit 5 – segment 1 - Example of cooling a microprocessor – 
finishing the analysis 

Back to our example...  Let’s consider a fan which has to cool a microprocessor in a 
desktop computer. If ambient air is used to cool the microchip and the heat 
dissipated by the CPU is 10 W, what is the temperature of the air out of the 
computer if the air speed is 0.9 m/s? 
Lots of good open ended material here. 
Step 1. Define the system. 
Step 2. Identify the proper forms for COM and COE 
Step 3. Find any missing state information. 
Step 4.  Find requested information.

Now let’s consider a time-varying or transient system. 
We want to fill a car tire that is low on air.  Let’s assume we are using a really good 
compressor that has a large reservoir tank with air at 20 oC and 350 psi.  Our tire, 10 
L in volume, initially has air at 15 psi and 20 oC (oops! we are not being good drivers).   
We fill the tire until we reach the recommended 35 psi.  If we assume the tire fills 
rapidly and the process is essentially adiabatic, how much air do we need to add to fill 
the tire? And can we determine the temperature of the air in the tire after we have 
finished filling the tire?

Treat the fill process as two sequential steps: a quick fill to a target intermediate 
pressure, followed by cooling to the desired fill pressure and ambient temperature.

The state conditions of the “fill” air would change during the filling process.  Yikes!
