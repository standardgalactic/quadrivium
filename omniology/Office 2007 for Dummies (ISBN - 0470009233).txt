About the Author
The author currently divides his time between writing computer books, 
writing articles for CPU Magazine, performing stand-up comedy, and writing
and speaking on a weekly comedy radio show along with fellow comedians
Rick Gene, Wes Sample, and Justin Davis. The show airs on 103.7 Free FM in
San Diego (http://1037freefm.com).
He also spends much of his time trying to keep his various computers running
properly using an odd mixture of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X software.
Eventually, he hopes to find the elusive combination of hardware and software
that can create the mythical dream of a computer that actually works when
you want it to.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to a variety of people, including the following:
All the long-suffering victims forced to learn the arcane features of Microsoft
Office, which seem to change with every version, not always for the best.
Take heart. You’re not stupid — it’s the people who write, sell, and encourage
the clumsy and complicated computer programs on the market who are the
really stupid ones.
All the friendly folks at the Riviera Comedy Club, located at the Riviera Hotel &
Casino (www.theriviera.com) in Las Vegas: Steve Schirripa (who appears
in HBO’s hit show, The Sopranos), Don Learned, Bob Zany (www.bobzany.com),
Gerry Bednob, Russ Rivas, Bruce Clark, Darrell Joyce, and Kip Addotta.
Additional thanks must also go to Chris (the Zooman) Clobber, Dante, Rick
Gene, Wes Sample, Justin Davis, and Leo (the man, the myth, the legend)
Fontaine just because they like seeing their names in print for no apparent
reason.
Continuing the theme of thanking people who had nothing to do with this
book, the author would also like to dedicate this book to LeStat’s, the best
little coffeehouse in San Diego, for providing a warm, friendly environment to
practice stand-up comedy in the safety and comfort of intelligent people who
haven’t drowned their inhibitions away in alcohol.
Final thanks go to Cassandra (my wife), Jordan (my son), and Bo, Scraps,
Tasha, and Nuit (our cats) for making my life more interesting by the minute.


Author’s Acknowledgments
Margot Hutchison and Bill Gladstone at Waterside Productions deserve spe-
cial acknowledgment because if it weren’t for their work, I might never have
been hired to write this book; and you would be reading some other author’s
acknowledgments and dedication. These two are the best agents an author
could hope for, so they deserve all the 15 percent of the book royalties that
they get.
Some other people who deserve thanks include Bob Woerner, acquisitions
editor; Jean Rogers, project editor; and Teresa Artman, copy editor; and the
rest of the happy gang of editors, managers, and workers who make Wiley
Publishing the best publisher to work for because they’re the complete oppo-
site of their competition.
Additional thanks go to technical editor Lee Musick for making sure that
everything in this book is accurate.
A final note of thanks go to anyone who has actually read the About the
Author, Dedication, and Author’s Acknowledgments pages because those
pages usually contain useless information that nobody except the author and
his closest friends even care about. Thanks for reading this — and say a prayer
for all the trees that sacrificed their pulp to allow authors (such as myself)
the indulgence to print paragraphs such as this.

Introduction
M
icrosoft Office 2007 contains loads of new features. Unfortunately, find-
ing — let alone using — these new features can be troublesome. So,
with Office 2007, Microsoft added its most important feature ever — making
the programs easier to use.
Office 2007’s biggest change is its new user interface. If you’re familiar with
the more traditional pull-down menus and toolbar icons from previous edi-
tions of Microsoft Office, you’ll soon find that this latest version of Microsoft
Office is designed to help you make the most out of Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
Access, and Outlook so you can find the features you need and use them
right away.
Who Should Buy This Book
This book is targeted toward two distinct groups. First, there are the people
already familiar with Microsoft Office who want to bone up on the new ways
that Office 2007 works. For these people, this book can serve as a handy ref-
erence to finding where Microsoft put various commands in the new Office
2007 user interface.
Then there’s a second group of people who may not be familiar with any
Microsoft Office program at all. For these people, this book can serve as a
guide through word processing (Microsoft Word), number calculations
(Microsoft Excel), presentations (Microsoft PowerPoint), database manage-
ment (Microsoft Access), and managing your personal resources like time,
appointments, and e-mail (Microsoft Outlook).
No matter how much (or how little) you may know about Microsoft Office,
this book introduces you to the most common features so you can start being
productive with Office 2007 right away.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you find what you need, this book is organized into parts where each
part covers a different program in Office 2007.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft 
Office 2007
Microsoft Office 2007 may look confusing at first glance, but after you under-
stand how it works, you’ll find that it’s surprisingly easy to use. This part of
the book explains the new Office menus and toolbars while also showing you
common commands that you can use in any Office 2007 program. By the time
you finish this part of the book, you’ll better understand how to use the indi-
vidual programs that make up the rest of Office 2007.
Part II: Working with Word
Word processing is the most popular use for Office 2007, so this part of the
book explains the basics to using Word. Not only does this part of the book
explain how to create and save text, but it also covers different ways to alter
text, such as using color, changing fonts, adding headers and footers, check-
ing spelling and grammar, and printing your written masterpiece so it looks
perfect.
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel
If you need to manipulate numbers, you need Microsoft Excel. This part of
the book explains the three basic parts of any spreadsheet, how to format
data, how to create formulas, and how to create different types of charts to
help you visualize what your spreadsheet numbers really mean. Not only will
this part of the book give you the lowdown on spreadsheets, but it shows you
how Microsoft Excel can make creating, formatting, and displaying spread-
sheets simple and easy — and most importantly, useful and fun.
Part IV: Making Presentations 
with PowerPoint
Throw away your overhead transparencies and clumsy whiteboard and pads
of paper. If you need to give a presentation to a large group, you need to know
how to create colorful and visually interesting presentations using
PowerPoint instead. With PowerPoint, you can organize a presentation into
slides that can display text, pictures, and even animation. By mastering
2
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

PowerPoint, you can create presentations that grab an audience’s attention
and emphasize the points you want to make.
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook
Almost nobody feels like they have enough time to stay organized, so this
part of the book explains why and how to use Microsoft Outlook. With
Outlook, you can read, sort, and write e-mail, keep track of appointments,
store names and addresses of your most important contacts, and even orga-
nize your daily to-do tasks. By reading about how to use Outlook in this part
of the book, you can see how to turn your computer into a personal assistant
to make you more productive.
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access
If you need to store large amounts of information, such as tracking invento-
ries, organizing customer orders, or tracking prospective customers, you
may need to use a database program like Microsoft Access. In this part of the
book, you’ll see how to use Access to store, retrieve, sort, and print your
data in different ways. With Access able to slice and dice your information,
you can better analyze your data to understand how your business really
works.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Almost every program offers multiple ways of accomplishing the same task,
and Office 2007 is no exception. After you get familiar with using Office, take a
peek in this part of the book to read about different types of shortcuts you can
use to work with Office even faster than before. This part of the book also offers
tips for using Office to make the programs even easier and more useful. By the
time you get to this part of the book, you may not be an Office expert, but you’ll
be much more comfortable using Office — and then you’ll feel comfortable
exploring and experimenting with different features on your own.
How to Use This Book
Although you can just flip through this book to find the features you need,
consider reading Part I of this book to discover how the new menus and tool-
bar icons of Office 2007 work and how they differ from previous versions of
3
Introduction

Microsoft Office. After you understand the basics to the way Office 2007
works, you’ll have a much better understanding for how each specific pro-
gram works.
Conventions
To get the most from this book, you need to understand the following con-
ventions:
 The mouse pointer appears as an arrow and serves two purposes. First,
you use the mouse pointer to select data (text, numbers, e-mail mes-
sages, and so on) to change. Second, you use the mouse pointer to tell
Office 2007 which commands you want to use to change the data you
selected.
 Clicking means moving the mouse pointer over something on the screen
(such as a menu command or a button), pressing the left mouse button
once, and then letting go. Clicking tells the computer, “See what I’m
pointing at? That’s what I want to choose right now.”
 Double-clicking means pointing at something with the mouse pointer and
clicking the left mouse button rapidly twice.
 Dragging means holding down the left mouse button while moving the
mouse. Dragging typically moves something from one location to
another, such as moving a word from the top of a paragraph to the
bottom.
 Right-clicking means moving the mouse pointer over something and
clicking the right mouse button once. Right-clicking typically displays a
shortcut menu of additional options.
In addition to understanding these terms to describe different mouse actions,
you also need to understand different keystroke conventions too. When you
see an instruction that reads Ctrl+P, that means to hold down the Ctrl key,
press the P key, and then let go of both the Ctrl and P key at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons highlight important or useful information.
This icon highlights information that can save you time or make it easier for
you to do something.
4
Office 2007 For Dummies

This icon emphasizes information that can be helpful, although not crucial,
when using Office 2007.
Look out! This icon highlights something dangerous that you need to avoid
before making a mistake that you might not be able to recover from again.
This icon highlights interesting technical information that you can safely
ignore but which might answer some questions for why Office 2007 works a
certain way.
Getting Started
The best way to master anything is to jump right in and start fiddling with dif-
ferent commands just to see what they do and how they work. In case you’re
afraid of breaking your computer or wiping out important data, play around
with Office 2007 on a “dummy” document filled with useless information you
can afford to lose (like your boss’s income tax returns).
Here’s your first tip. Any time you do something in Office 2007, you can undo
or take back your last command by pressing Ctrl+Z. (Just hold down the Ctrl
key, press the Z key, and release both keys at the same time.) There, now that
you know about the powerful Undo command, you should have a surging
sense of invulnerability when using Office 2007, knowing that at any time you
make a mistake, you can turn back time by pressing Ctrl+Z to undo your last
command.
If you get nothing else from this book, always remember that the Ctrl+Z com-
mand can save you from yourself. See? Mastering Office 2007 is going to be
easier than you think.

Getting to Know
Microsoft 
Office 2007

In this part . . .
A
t first glance, Microsoft Office 2007 may seem a com-
plicated beast that gobbles up megabytes of hard
drive space and offers enough features to overwhelm even
the most battle-hardened veteran of the personal com-
puter wars. But after you get over your initial impression
(or fear) of Office, you can understand (and even admire)
the elegant madness behind its massive bulk.
Despite the fact that Microsoft Office 2007 contains more
commands than any sane person could ever possibly use, it
can be conquered. Perhaps the most important part of this
book explains the completely redesigned user interface of
Microsoft Office 2007. While this user interface may look
strange and confusing at first, it’s actually much easier
to learn than previous incarnations of Microsoft Office.
After you get familiar with this new user interface, you’ll
find yourself being more productive than ever before.
To guide you through the multitude of commands you
may need to get your work done, Office provides several
ways to get help, one of which (hopefully) will actually
provide you with the answers you need.
Besides showing you how to get help within Office, this
part of the book also explains how to get the various pro-
grams of Office started in the first place. After you start
using Office, this part of the book also shows you some of
the more common keystroke and menu commands that all
Office programs share. That way when you figure out how
to use one Office program, you can quickly learn and use
any other Office program with a minimum of retraining
and hassle, and you can then join the ranks of the many
happy people already using Microsoft Office 2007 to get
their work done.

M
icrosoft Office 2007 consists of five core programs: Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook. Each of these core programs spe-
cializes in manipulating different data. Word manipulates words, sentences,
and paragraphs; Excel manipulates numbers; PowerPoint manipulates text
and pictures to create a slide show; Access manipulates data, such as inven-
tories; and Outlook manipulates personal information, such as e-mail
addresses and phone numbers.
Although each Office 2007 program specializes in storing and manipulating
different types of data, they all work in similar ways. First, you have to enter
data into an Office 2007 program by typing on the keyboard or loading data
from an existing file. Second, you have to tell Office 2007 how to manipulate
your data, such as underlining, enlarging, coloring, or deleting it. Third, you
have to save your data as a file.
To help you understand this three-step process of entering, manipulating,
and saving data, Office 2007 offers similar commands among all its programs
so you can quickly jump from Word to PowerPoint to Excel without having to
relearn entirely new commands to use each program. Even better, Office 2007
rearranges its numerous commands so finding the command you need is
faster and easier than ever before. (If you think this implies that previous ver-
sions of Microsoft Office were clumsy and hard to use, you’re right.)

If you’re already familiar with computers and previous editions of Microsoft
Office, you may want to browse through this chapter just to get acquainted
with how Office 2007 rearranges common program commands. If you’ve
never used a computer before or just don’t feel comfortable using Microsoft
Office, read this chapter first.
Loading an Office 2007 Program
The first step to using Office 2007 is loading the program you want to use. To
load any Office 2007 program, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
A pop-up menu appears.
2. Choose All Programs.
Another pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Microsoft Office.
A list of programs appears on the Start menu, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1:

4. Choose the Office 2007 program you want to use, such as Microsoft
Word or Microsoft PowerPoint.
Your chosen program appears on the screen.
Getting to Know the New User Interface
Office 2007 offers a new user interface for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access,
and some parts of Outlook. This new user interface consists of three parts, as
shown in Figure 1-2:

Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

The File menu
The File menu contains commands for opening, saving, printing, and closing
a file. In Word, a file is called a document. In Excel, a file is called a workbook.
In PowerPoint, a file is called a presentation. In Access, a file is called a database.
In previous versions of Office, the File menu was clearly labeled File. In Office
2007, the File menu appears when you click the Office Button in the upper-left
corner (refer to Figure 1-2).
You can display the File menu by clicking the Office Button or by pressing Alt+F.
Creating a new file
When you first load an Office 2007 program, it automatically creates an
empty file for you to use right away. In case you need to create a new file after
you’ve already loaded an Office 2007 program, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button.
A drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Figure 1-3:

12
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

2. Choose New.
A New dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-4. Depending on which
program you’re using, the dialog box may read New Document (for
Word), New Workbook (for Excel), and so on.
3. Click Blank (such as Blank Document or Blank Workbook) and then
click the Create button.
Depending on which program you’re using, you may choose Blank
Document for Word or Blank Presentation for PowerPoint. A blank file
appears ready for you to start storing data in it.
Creating a new file from a template
Rather than create a blank file, you may find it easier to use a template
instead. A template contains predefined formatting for creating different
types of files easily, such as calendars, newsletters, sales reports, or a corpo-
rate slide show presentation. Office 2007 provides three types of templates:
 Office 2007 templates installed on your computer
 Templates available over the Internet on the Microsoft Web site
 Existing files that you create and format yourself

Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

Using an Office 2007 template on your computer
Installing Office 2007 automatically installs dozens of templates for Word,
Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. To use one of these templates, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Office Button and choose New.
A New window appears (refer to Figure 1-4).
2. Click Installed Templates.
The New window displays all the installed templates on your computer.
3. Click the template you want to use and then click the Create button.
Office 2007 creates a new file based on your chosen template.
Downloading and using a template off Microsoft’s Web site
Microsoft provides a huge library of templates that you can download from
its Web site. To retrieve these templates, you need to connect to the Internet
and then follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose New.
A New window appears (refer to Figure 1-4).
2. Click a category underneath Microsoft Office Online, such as
Calendars or Award Certificates.
The New window displays all the templates available from the Microsoft
Web site, as shown in Figure 1-5.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

3. Click the template you want to use and then click the Download
button.
Office 2007 downloads and creates a new file based on your chosen 
template.
Opening an existing file
When you load an Office 2007 program, you’ll probably want to edit a file that
you had created and modified before. To open an existing file, you need to
tell Office 2007 the location and name of the file you want to open. Just follow
these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
An Open dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-6.
2. (Optional) To choose a different drive to look for files, click Computer
under the Favorite Links panel (see the left side of Figure 1-6). Then
click the drive where you want to load the file, such as the C: drive.
3. (Optional) Click a folder and then click Open to search for a file inside
a folder. Repeat this step as many times as necessary.
4. Click the file you want to open and then click Open.
Your chosen file appears ready for editing.
Figure 1-6:
The Open
dialog box
lets you

15
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

When you click the Open command under Microsoft Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, and Access, an additional window appears to the right that con-
tains a list of the last files you opened. If you want to load a file you’ve
recently used, just click that filename to load that file.
Saving files
Saving a file stores all your data on a hard disk or other storage device (such
as a Compact Flash card). The first time you save a file, you need to specify
three items:
 The drive and folder to store your file
 The name of your file
 The format to save your file
The drive and folder where you store your files is completely arbitrary.
However, it’s a good idea to store similar files in a folder with a descriptive
name, such as Tax Evasion Information for 2008 or Extortion Letters to
Grandma. By default, Office 2007 stores all your files in the Documents folder.
The name of your file is also completely arbitrary, but it’s also a good idea to
give your file a descriptive name such as Latest Resume to Escape My Dead-
End Job or Global Trade Presentation for World Domination Meeting on
September 9, 2008.
The format of your file defines how Office 2007 stores your data. The default
file format is known as Office 2007 format, which simply means that only
people with Office 2007 can reliably open and view the contents of that file. If
you want to share your files with people who don’t use Office 2007, you have
to save your files in a different file format.
Saving a file for Office 2007
If you’re the only person who needs to view and edit your files, you can save
a file in Office 2007 format by following these steps:
1. Click the Office Button.
A drop-down menu appears.
2. Click Save.
If this is the first time you’re saving the file, a Save As dialog box
appears, as shown at the top of Figure 1-7.
16
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

For a quick way to choose the Office Button➪Save command, click the
Save icon that appears to the right of the Office Button or press Ctrl+S.
3. (Optional) To specify a drive and folder to save your file, click Browse
Folders.
This causes the dialog box to expand, as shown in the bottom dialog box
in Figure 1-7. Now you can click Computer, under Favorite Links, and
then click a folder. Or, click the New Folder button; when the New Folder
dialog box appears, type a name for your new folder and then click OK.
4. Click in the File Name text box and type a descriptive name for your
file.
5. Click Save.
After you’ve saved a file, you’ll only have to go through Steps 1 and 2 because
you don’t have to specify a location and filename to save an existing file.
Figure 1-7:
The Save As
dialog box
lets you
choose the
name, file
format, and
a location to
save your
file.
17
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

Saving a file for older versions of Microsoft Office
If you need to share files with people using older versions of Microsoft Office,
you need to save your files in a different file format known as 97-2003, such as
Word 97-2003 Document or PowerPoint 97-2003 Presentation.
This special 97-2003 file format saves Office 2007 files so that previous ver-
sions of Microsoft Office 97/2000/XP/2003 can open and edit your files.
When you save files in the 97-2003 format, Microsoft Office 2007 saves your
files with a three-letter file extension, like .doc or .xls. When you save files
in the Office 2007 format, Microsoft Office 2007 saves your files with a four or
five-letter file extension, such as .docx or .pptx, as shown in Table 1-1.
Table 1-1

To save your Office 2007 files as a 97-2003 format, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Save As.
A Save As dialog box appears.
2. Click in the Save as Type list box.
A list of different formats appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.
When you choose the Save As command in Step 1, you’re making a copy
of your original file.
3. Choose the 97-2003 format option, such as Word 97-2003 Format or
Excel 97-2003 Format.
The Save as Type list box displays a huge list of file formats, such as
XML Data or Text. Most programs can accept files stored in the 97-2003
format, but many older programs cannot, so you may have to resort to
saving a file in one of these other formats instead.
18
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

4. (Optional) Click in the File Name text box and type a descriptive name
for your file.
5. Click Save.
Closing a file
When you’re done editing a file, you need to close it. Closing a file simply
removes the file from your screen but keeps your Office 2007 program run-
ning so you can edit or open another file. If you haven’t saved your file, clos-
ing a file will prompt you to save your changes.
To close a file, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Close.
If you haven’t saved your file, a dialog box appears asking whether you
want to save your changes.
For a faster way to choose the Close command, press Ctrl+F4.
2. Click Yes to save your changes, No to discard any changes, or Cancel
to keep your file open.
If you click either Yes or No, Office 2007 closes your file.
Using the Quick Access toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar appears to the right of the Office Button (refer to
Figure 1-2) near the top of the screen, displaying icons that represent com-
monly used commands such as Save, Undo, and Redo as shown in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-8:
The Save as
Type list box
lets you
choose a
file format
for saving
your file.
19
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

Using the Quick Access icons
If you click the Save icon in the Quick Access toolbar, Office 2007 saves your
current file. If you’re saving a new file, a dialog box pops up, asking you to
choose a name for your file.
If you click the Print icon in the Quick Access toolbar, Office 2007 immediately
prints one copy of your entire file through the default printer. (If you want to
specify a different printer to use, the number of copies to print, or specific
pages to print, click the Office Button and choose Print instead.)
The Redo icon reverses the last Undo command you chose. For example, 
if you delete a paragraph, Office 2007 makes that paragraph disappear. 
Then if you immediately click the Undo icon, the paragraph magically reap-
pears. If you immediately click the Redo icon, the Redo command reverses
the Undo command and deletes the paragraph once more.
The Undo icon is unique in that it offers two ways to use it. First, you can
click the Undo icon to undo the last action you chose. Second, you can click
the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the Undo icon to
display a list of one or more of your previous actions, as shown in Figure 1-10.

The most recent action you chose appears at the top of this list, the second
most recent action appears second, and so on. To undo multiple commands,
follow these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Undo icon in the Quick Access toolbar.
2. Move the mouse pointer to highlight one or more actions you want to
undo.
3. Click the left mouse button.
Office 2007 undoes all the multiple actions you selected.
Adding icons
The Quick Access toolbar is designed to put your most commonly used com-
mands where you can always find them. To add other icons to the Quick
Access toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar arrow (refer to Figure 1-9).
A pull-down menu appears.
You can add an icon to the toolbar by just clicking on an icon name,
such as Quick Print or New, from the pull-down menu.
2. Click More Commands.
An Options window appears, as shown in Figure 1-11. The panel on the
right shows all the current icons on the Quick Access toolbar. The panel
on the left shows all the additional icons you can add.

4. Click an icon and then click the Add button.
5. (Optional) Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each additional icon you want to
add to the Quick Access toolbar.
6. Click OK.
Your chosen icon (or icons) now appears on the Quick Access toolbar.
Removing icons
You can remove icons from the Quick Access toolbar at any time. To remove
an icon, follow these steps:
1. Right-click an icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
A pull-down menu appears.
2. Click Remove from Quick Access Toolbar.
Office 2007 removes your selected icon from the Quick Access toolbar.
Moving the Quick Access toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar can appear in one of two places:
 Above the Ribbon (its default location)
 Below the Ribbon
To move the Quick Access toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar arrow.
A pull-down menu appears.
2. Choose Place Quick Access Toolbar Below (or Above) the Ribbon.
If the Quick Access toolbar currently appears over the Ribbon, you’ll see
the Place Quick Access Toolbar Below the Ribbon command. If the
Quick Access toolbar appears under the Ribbon, you’ll see the Place
Quick Access Toolbar Above the Ribbon command.
Minimizing the Ribbon
You can tuck the Ribbon out of sight temporarily so it only appears when you
click on a tab such as Home or Insert. To hide the Ribbon, follow these steps:
22
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Undo icon in the Quick Access toolbar.
A pull-down menu appears.
2. Click Minimize the Ribbon.
Office 2007 hides the Ribbon and only displays the tabs. To display the
Ribbon again, repeat these two steps.
Using the Ribbon
The Ribbon organizes commands into categories called contextual tabs. Each
tab displays a different group of commands. For example, the Page Layout tab
displays only those commands related to designing a page, and the Insert 
tab displays only those commands related to inserting items into a file, such
as a page break or a picture, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Using the Ribbon is a two-step process. First, you must click the tab that con-
tains the command you want. Second, you click the actual command.
Tabs act exactly like traditional pull-down menus. Whereas a pull-down menu
simply displays a list of commands, tabs display a list of icons that represent
different commands.
Deciphering Ribbon icons
The main idea behind organizing commands within tabs is to avoid over-
whelming you with a barrage of different commands. Although most icons
include a short text description, you can get additional help deciphering dif-
ferent icons through ScreenTips, which typically displays the following, as
shown in Figure 1-13:
Figure 1-12:
Each tab
displays a
different
group of
related
commands.
23
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

 The official name of the command (which is Format Painter in 
Figure 1-13)
 The equivalent keystroke shortcut you can use to run the command
(which is Ctrl+Shift+C in the figure)
 A short explanation of what the command does
To view the ScreenTip for a command, move the mouse pointer over a com-
mand and wait a few seconds for the ScreenTip appear.
Shortcut keystrokes let you choose a command from the keyboard without
the hassle of clicking a tab and then clicking the command buried inside that
tab. Most shortcut keystrokes consist of two or three keys, such as Ctrl+P or
Ctrl+Shift+C.
Using Live Preview
In the past, you might have known what a particular command did, but you
would never know how it would affect your file until after you chose that com-
mand. Oftentimes, you might choose a command, see how it changed your file,
and then undo the change because it may not be what you really wanted.
To avoid this hassle of constant experimentation with different commands,
Office 2007 offers a feature called Live Preview. Live Preview lets you move
the mouse pointer over certain icons displayed in a tab and then immediately
see the changes displayed in your current file.
To use Live Preview, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor (or click the mouse) on an object (text, picture, table,
and so on) that you want to change.
2. Move the mouse pointer over any command.
Office 2007 shows you how your chosen object will look if you choose
the command, as shown in Figure 1-14.
Figure 1-13:
ScreenTips
explain
what each
command
does.
24
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007

3. Click the command to change your object (or move the mouse pointer
away from the command so you don’t choose that command).
In Word, Live Preview will not work if you display your document in Draft view.
Giving commands to Office 2007
To give a command to Office 2007, you need to follow these basic steps:
1. Select an item (text, picture, table, and so on) that you want to modify.
2. Click a tab that contains the command you want.
3. Click the command you want to use.
Command icons work in one of three ways, as shown in Figure 1-15:
 Clickable icons: Clicking an icon immediately chooses a command to
alter your data. The Bold and Italic icons are examples of icons that you
click only once to choose them.
 List box icons: Some icons display a downward-pointing arrow to the
right. Clicking these icons displays a list of additional options. The Font
and Font Size icons are examples of list box icons.
 Gallery icons: Some icons display a downward-pointing arrow that dis-
plays a drop-down list of additional commands, called a gallery.

5. Click OK when you’re done choosing different customizing options.
If you click the Save category in Step 4, you can define a default file format
and file location for storing files for each Office 2007 program (Word, Excel,
and so on).
Exiting Office 2007
No matter how much you may love using Office 2007, eventually there will
come a time when you need to exit an Office 2007 program and do something
else with your life. To exit from any Office 2007 program (except Outlook),
choose one of the following:
 Click the Close box in the upper-right corner of the Office 2007 window.
 Click the Office Button and then click the Exit button (refer to Figure 1-3).
 Press Alt+F4.

 Sharing data within Office 2007
A
lthough you create a file only once, you can edit it many times. Editing
can add, rearrange, or delete data, such as text, numbers, or pictures.
All Office 2007 programs work in similar ways to edit data, so whether you
use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access, you’ll know the right commands to
edit data no matter which program you may be using.
Whenever you edit a file, save your file periodically by clicking the Save icon
in the Quick Access toolbar, pressing Ctrl+S, or clicking the Office Button and
choosing Save. That way if your computer crashes or the power goes out,
you won’t lose all the editing changes you made.
Adding Data by Pointing
When you enter data into a file, your data appears wherever the cursor
appears on the screen. The cursor appears as a blinking vertical bar, which
basically says, “Anything you type now will appear right here!”
Because the cursor won’t always magically appear exactly where you want to
type data, you must move the cursor using either the mouse or the keyboard.
To move the cursor using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer where you want to move the cursor.
2. Click the left mouse button.
The cursor appears where you click the mouse pointer.

To move the cursor using the keyboard, you can use one of many cursor
movement keys:
 The (up/down/left/right) arrow keys
 The Home/End keys
 The Page Up/Page Down keys
Use the up/down/right/left arrow keys when you want to move the cursor
a small distance, such as up one line or right to the next cell in an Excel
spreadsheet.
To move the cursor faster, hold down the Ctrl key and then press the arrow
keys. If you hold down the Ctrl key, the up-arrow key moves the cursor up
one paragraph, the down-arrow key moves the cursor down one paragraph,
the left-arrow key moves the cursor left one word, and the right-arrow key
moves the cursor right one word.
Pressing the Home key moves the cursor to the beginning of a sentence (or a
row in a spreadsheet), and pressing the End key moves the cursor to the end
of a sentence (or a row in a spreadsheet).
Pressing the Page Up/Page Down keys moves the cursor up or down one
screen at a time.
Using any of the cursor movement keys moves the cursor to a new location.
Wherever the cursor appears will be where you can enter new data. Table 2-1
lists ways to move the cursor in each Office 2007 program.

Selecting Data
To modify data, you must tell Office 2007 what you want to change by select-
ing it. Then choose a command that changes your data, such as underlining
text or deleting a picture.
To select anything in Office 2007, you can use either the mouse or the key-
board. Generally, the mouse is faster but takes some time getting used to
coordinating the motion of the mouse with the movement of the mouse
pointer on the screen. The keyboard is slower but much simpler to use.
Selecting data with the mouse
The mouse provides two ways to select data. The first way involves pointing
and dragging the mouse, as shown in Figure 2-1.
1. Point the mouse pointer at the beginning or end of the data you want
to select.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse pointer
over the data to select it.
When you drag the mouse, hold down the left mouse button. If you don’t hold
down the left mouse button as you move the mouse, you won’t select any
data when you move the mouse pointer across the screen.
You can also select data by clicking the mouse. To select a picture, such as a
chart in Microsoft Excel or a photograph added to a Microsoft Word docu-
ment, just click the picture to select it. Office 2007 displays rectangles, called
handles, around the border of any selected picture, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

To select text with the mouse, you can click the mouse in one of three ways,
as shown in Figure 2-3:
 Single-click: Moves the cursor
 Double-click: Selects the word that you click
 Triple-click: Selects the entire paragraph that contains the word you
click
Office 2007 defines a paragraph as any chunk of text that begins on a sep-
arate line and ends with a Return character (¶), created by pressing the
Enter key.
Selecting data with the keyboard
To select data with the keyboard, you need to use the following keys:
 The cursor movement keys (up/down/left/right arrow keys,
Home/End keys, or Page Up/Page Down keys)
 The Shift key
Figure 2-3:
To select
text, you
can either
double- or
triple-click it.
33
Chapter 2: Editing Data

The cursor movement keys simply move the cursor. The Shift key acts like
the left mouse button and tells Office 2007 what to select. To select data, you
have to follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor to the beginning or end of the data you want to select.
2. Hold down the Shift key. (Keep it pressed down.)
3. Move the cursor using any of the cursor movement keys, such as the
up-arrow key or the End key.
4. Release the Shift key.
You may find it easier to place the cursor with the mouse and then hold down
the Shift key while pressing a cursor movement key to select data more pre-
cisely than you can by dragging the mouse.
To select all the data in a file, press Ctrl+A.
Selecting multiple chunks of data 
with the mouse and keyboard
For greater flexibility in selecting data, you can use both the mouse and the
keyboard to select multiple chunks of data at the same time. To select two or
more chunks of data, follow these steps:
1. Select a picture or chunk of text using either the keyboard or the mouse.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key.
3. Select another picture or chunk of test using either the keyboard or
the mouse.
4. Repeat Step 3 for each additional item you want to select.
5. Release the Ctrl key when you’re done selecting data.
Editing Data with the Pop-up Toolbar
As soon as you select data, Office 2007 displays a pop-up toolbar that dis-
plays the most commonly used commands (displayed as icons). This pop-up
toolbar appears to the upper right of the data you selected as a faint image.
The closer you move the mouse towards this pop-up toolbar, the darker and
sharper the toolbar appears, as shown in Figure 2-4. The farther you move
away from the toolbar, the fainter it appears.
34
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

To use this pop-up toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Select data using the mouse.
Selecting data with the keyboard will not display the pop-up toolbar.
2. Move the mouse pointer to the area to the upper right of the
selected data.
The pop-up toolbar appears.
The closer you move the mouse to the toolbar, the more visible the tool-
bar will appear.
3. Click a command (icon) on the pop-up toolbar.
Deleting Data
The simplest way to edit a file is to delete your existing data. If you just need
to delete a single character, you can use one of two keys:
 Backspace: Deletes the character immediately to the left of the cursor
 Delete: Deletes the character immediately to the right of the cursor
If you need to delete large chunks of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the data you want to delete using either the keyboard or the
mouse. (See the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”)
2. Press the Delete key.
Office 2007 wipes away your data.

Whenever
you select
data,
Office 2007

Chapter 2: Editing Data

Cutting and Pasting (Moving) Data
Moving data in Office 2007 requires a two-step process: cut and paste.
When you cut data, you delete it but save a copy in a special area of the 
computer’s memory known as the Clipboard. When you paste data to a new
location, you copy the data off the Clipboard and paste it in your file, as
shown in Figure 2-5.
To move data, follow these steps:
1. Select the data you want to move, using the keyboard or mouse as
explained in the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
2. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Cut icon (from the Home tab).
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose Cut.
• Press Ctrl+X.
3. Move the cursor to a new location.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Paste icon (from the Home tab).
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose Paste.
• Press Ctrl+V.

it on the
Clipboard,
and then

36
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

If you select data in Step 3, you can replace the selected data with the pasted
data you selected in Steps 1 and 2.
Copying and Pasting Data
Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves your selected data in
its original location but places a second copy of that data somewhere else.
To copy and paste data, follow these steps:
1. Select the data you want to copy, using the keyboard or mouse, as
explained in the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
2. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Copy icon.
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose Copy.
• Press Ctrl+C.
3. Move the cursor to a new location.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Paste icon.
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose Paste.
• Press Ctrl+V.
Dragging with the Mouse 
to Cut, Copy, and Paste
The mouse can also cut/copy and paste data. To move data with the mouse,
follow these steps:
1. Select the data you want to move using the methods described in the
earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
2. Move the mouse pointer over the highlighted data.
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
The mouse pointer displays an arrow and a box while the cursor turns
into a dotted vertical line.
Alternatively, to copy data, hold down the Ctrl key while holding down
the left mouse button and dragging (moving) the mouse. The mouse
pointer displays an arrow and a box with a plus sign while the cursor
turns into a dotted vertical line.
37
Chapter 2: Editing Data

4. Move the dotted vertical line cursor where you want to place the data
you selected in Step 1.
5. Release the left mouse button.
Your data appears in its new location.
Undo and Redo
To protect you from mistakes, Office 2007 offers a special Undo command,
which essentially tells the computer, “Remember that last command I just
gave? Pretend I never chose it.”
You can use the Undo command any time you edit data and want to reverse
your changes. The two ways to choose the Undo command are
 Click the Undo icon on the Quick Access toolbar (see Figure 2-6).
 Press Ctrl+Z.
Sometimes you may make many changes to your file and suddenly realize
that the last five or ten changes you made messed up your data by mistake.
To undo multiple commands, follow these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Undo icon.
A list of your previously chosen commands appears.
2. Move the mouse pointer to highlight all the commands that you want
to undo, as shown in Figure 2-7.
3. Click the left mouse button.
Office 2007 undoes your chosen commands.
Undo

Figure 2-6:
The Undo
and Redo

toolbar.
38
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

Until you choose the Undo command at least once, the Redo icon appears
dimmed. The Redo command lets you reapply the last command you chose
to undo. The two ways to choose the Redo command are
 Click the Redo icon (refer to Figure 2-6).
 Press Ctrl+Y.
Each time you choose the Redo command, you reverse the effect of the last
Undo command. For example, if you use the Undo command four times, you
can choose the Redo command only up to four times.
Sharing Data with Other 
Office 2007 Programs
Cutting, copying, and pasting data may be handy within the same file, but
Office 2007 also gives you the ability to cut, copy, and paste data between dif-
ferent programs, such as copying a chart from Excel and pasting it into a
PowerPoint presentation.

Chapter 2: Editing Data

Using the Office Clipboard
When you cut or copy any data, Windows stores it in a special part of memory
called the Clipboard. This Windows Clipboard can only hold one item at a
time, so Office 2007 comes with its own Clipboard called the Office Clipboard,
which can store up to 24 items.
Whereas the Windows Clipboard works with any Windows program (such as
Microsoft Paint or WordPerfect), the Office Clipboard works only with Office
2007 programs (such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook).
To store data on the Office Clipboard, you just need to use the Cut or Copy
command, and Office 2007 automatically stores your data on the Office
Clipboard.
The two big advantages of the Office Clipboard are
 You can store up to 24 items.
The Windows Clipboard can store only one item.
 You can select what you want to paste from the Clipboard.
The Windows Clipboard lets you paste only the last item cut or copied.
Viewing and pasting items 
off the Office Clipboard
After you use the Cut or Copy command at least once, your data gets stored
on the Office Clipboard. You can then view the Office Clipboard and choose
which data you want to paste from the Clipboard into your file.
To view the Office Clipboard and paste items from it, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor to the spot where you want to paste an item from the
Office Clipboard.
2. Click the Office Clipboard icon.
The Office Clipboard pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-8. The Office
Clipboard also displays an icon that shows you the program where the
data came from, such as Word or PowerPoint.
3. Click the item you want to paste.
Office 2007 pastes your chosen item into the file where you moved the
cursor in Step 1.
40
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

4. Click the Close box of the Office Clipboard window to tuck it out of
sight.
If you click the Paste All button, you can paste every item on the Office
Clipboard into your file.
Deleting items from the Office Clipboard
You can add up to 24 items to the Office Clipboard. The moment you add a
25th item, Office 2007 deletes the oldest item from the Office Clipboard to
make room for the new cut or copied item.
You can also manually delete items from the Office Clipboard as well, by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Click the Office Clipboard icon (refer to Figure 2-8).
The Office Clipboard appears.
Figure 2-8:
The Office

Chapter 2: Editing Data

2. Move the mouse pointer over an item on the Office Clipboard.
A downward-pointing arrow appears to the right. A pop-up menu
appears, as shown in Figure 2-9.
3. Click Delete.
Office 2007 deletes your chosen item.
4. Click the Close box to tuck the Office Clipboard out of sight.
If you click the Clear All button, you can delete every item currently stored
on the Office Clipboard.
Make sure you really want to delete an item from the Office Clipboard
because after you delete it, you can’t retrieve it.

 Changing the appearance of the Help window
M
icrosoft designed Office 2007 to be the easiest version of Office ever.
Yet, despite these improvements in Office 2007’s user interface, you
may still need help in using one of the many Office programs once in a while.
To help answer your questions, Office 2007 provides a Help system, which
lets you browse through different help topics until you (hopefully) find the
answer you need. There are two ways to use the Help system. One, you can
browse through the various topics displayed until you find the answer you
want. This can take time to search but can also show you related help that
you might find useful.
A second way to use the Help system is to type a query such as Page margins
or Font size. The Help system will then display all topics related to your
query. This can be a fast way to search for help, but if you don’t type the
right terms that the Help system recognizes, this method may not find the
exact help you need.
Browsing the Help Window
Each Office 2007 program comes with its own help files that you can access
at any time. To browse through the Help system, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following to display the Help window, as shown in
Figure 3-1:
• Click the Help icon.
• Press F1.

2. Click a topic.
The Help window either displays a list of subcategories or a list of Help
topics (that appear with a question mark icon in the left margin), as
shown in Figure 3-2. If a list of subcategories appears, you may have to
click a subcategory until the Help window displays a list of help topics.
3. Click a Help topic identified by a question mark icon in the left margin.
The Help window displays step-by-step explanations.
4. Click the Close box when you’re done to make the Help window go
away.
If you click the Back icon, you can view the previous text displayed in the Help
window. If you click the Forward icon (after clicking the Back icon at least
once), you can return forward to the text that you were looking at before you
clicked the Back icon. If you click the Home icon, you can view the Help
window’s list of topics that appear every time you open the Help window.

Searching in the Help Window
Rather than browse through one or more subcategories to find help, you
might want to search for help by typing in one or more keywords. Such key-
words can identify a specific topic such as Printing or Editing charts.
If you misspell a topic, the Help system may not understand what you want
to find, so check your spelling.
To search the Help window by typing in a keyword or two, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following methods to display the Help window
(refer to Figure 3-1):
• Click the Help icon.
• Press F1.
2. Click in the Search list box and type one or more keywords, such as
Formatting or Aligning text.
3. Click Search.
The Help window displays a list of topics, as shown in Figure 3-3.
4. Click a Help topic.
The Help window displays step-by-step instructions for your chosen topic.

Making the Help Window Easier to Read
One problem with the Help window is that it may appear too small to read
comfortably. To get around this problem, you have two choices:
 Resize the Help window.
 Expand the size of the text inside the Help window.
Resizing the Help window
You can resize the Help window just like any other window by clicking one of
the following icons in the upper-right corner:
 Minimize: Shrinks the Help window to an icon on the Windows taskbar
 Maximize: Expands the Help window to fill the entire screen
 Restore Down: Shrinks a maximized window to a smaller window that
you can move and resize

In addition to, or as an alternative to, resizing the Help window, you can
enlarge the text inside the Help window to make it larger (or smaller) so you
can read it easier or so you can cram more text within the limited confines of
the Help window. To change the size of the text inside the Help window,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Help icon or press F1 to open the Help window.
2. Click the Change Font Size icon.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-4.
3. Choose an option, such as Smaller or Largest.
The Help window text changes in size.

Keeping the Help window 
visible at all times
Office 2007 offers a Keep on Top icon that you can choose to keep the Help
window visible while letting you use the Office 2007 program underneath.
That way you can read and follow the instructions in the Help window while
using your program at the same time.
If you turn the Keep on Top feature off, the Help window will appear; but, the
moment you click in your Office 2007 program underneath, the Help window
disappears from sight.
To turn the Keep on Top feature on (or off), click the Keep on Top icon in the
Help window (refer to Figure 3-4).
Printing the text in the Help window
Sometimes you may find the step-by-step instructions in the Help window
so useful that you may want to reference them again. Rather than open the
Help window each time, you can print the step-by-step instructions so you’ll
always have them at your fingertips when you need them.
To print the text displayed in the Help window, follow these steps:
1. Click the Help icon or press F1 to open the Help window.
2. Make sure your printer is connected to your computer and turned on.
3. Click the Print icon (refer to Figure 3-4).
The Print dialog box appears.
4. Choose any options in the Print dialog box (such as choosing a printer
to use), and then click OK to print the current contents of the Help
window.
Viewing the Table of Contents
One problem with searching through the Help window is that you can easily
lose track of which subcategory or category led you to view the current con-
tents of the Help window. To avoid this confusion, you can expand the Help
window to display two panes. The left pane displays a table of contents while
the right pane displays additional information, as shown in Figure 3-5.
48
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2007 

To view the Table of Contents, follow these steps:
1. Click the Help icon or press F1 to open the Help window.
2. Click the Show Table of Contents icon.
The Help window expands into two panes.
3. Click a Help topic (which appears with a closed book icon in the left
margin).
A list of subcategories (closed book icon) or Help topics (question mark
icon) appears. You may need to click one or more additional subcategory
icons until you see a list of Help topics.
4. Click a Help topic.
The right pane of the Help window displays step-by-step instructions.
5. (Optional) Click the Hide Table of Contents icon.
If you leave the Table of Contents pane visible, the next time you open
the Help window, you’ll see the table of contents in the left pane.
6. Click the Close box to make the Help window go away.

In this part . . .
W
ord processing remains the most popular use for a
personal computer (right after playing games and
wasting hours exploring the Internet), so this part of the
book gently guides you into using the powerhouse word
processor known as Microsoft Word. By using the 2007
version of Word, you can create anything from a simple
letter to a resume or business report.
Along the way to discovering how to use Word’s powerful
features, you also encounter the more basic features, such
as how to write, edit, spell-check, and grammar-check your
writing, and how to format text to make it look really pretty.
Word may seem like an ordinary word processor at first
glance, but this part of the book unlocks the techniques
that summon Word to help you write, create, and print
your ideas as fast as you care to type them. (Just as long
as your computer doesn’t crash on you, that is.)

Chapter 4
Typing Text in Word
In This Chapter
 Moving the cursor with the mouse and keyboard
 Viewing a document
 Navigating through a document
 Checking spelling and grammar
 Typing unusual symbols
T
he whole purpose of Microsoft Word is to let you type text and make it
look pretty so you can print or send it for other people to read. So the
first step in using Microsoft Word is learning how to enter text in a Word file,
called a document.
In every document, Word displays a blinking cursor that points to where your
text will appear if you type anything. To move the cursor, you can use the
keyboard or the mouse.
Moving the Cursor with the Mouse
When you move the mouse, Word turns the mouse pointer into an I-beam
pointer. If you move the mouse over an area where you cannot type any text,
the mouse pointer turns back into the traditional arrow, pointing up to the left.
To move the cursor with the mouse, just point and click the left mouse
button once. The blinking cursor appears where you clicked the mouse.
If you have a blank page or a blank area at the end of your document, you can
move the cursor anywhere within this blank area by following these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer over any blank area past the end of a document.
Word defines the end of a document as the spot where no more text
appears. To find the end of a document, press Ctrl+End.
• In a new document: The end of the document is in the upper-left
corner where the cursor appears.

• In a document with existing text: The end of the document is the last
area where text appears (including spaces or tabs).
2. Move the mouse pointer over any blank area past the end of the 
document.
Notice that a Left, Center, or Right Justification icon appears to the right
or bottom of the I-beam mouse pointer, as shown in Figure 4-1.
3. Make sure the correct justification icon appears next to the mouse
pointer.
For example, if you want to center-justify your text, make sure the
Center Justification icon appears at the bottom of the I-beam pointer.
Getting the Left, Center, or Right Justification icon to appear in Step 3
can be tricky. The Left Justification icon appears most of the time. To
make the Center Justification icon appear, move the mouse pointer to
the center of the page. To make the Right Justification icon appear,
move the mouse pointer to the right edge of the page.
4. Double-click the mouse pointer.
Word displays your cursor in the area you clicked. Any text you type now
will appear justified according to the justification icon displayed in Step 3.
Moving the Cursor with the Keyboard
Moving the cursor with the mouse can be fast and easy. However, touch-typists
often find that moving the cursor with the keyboard is more convenient and
sometimes faster too. Table 4-1 lists different keystroke combinations you
can use to move the cursor.
You can move the cursor with both the keyboard and the mouse.

Viewing a Document
Word can display your document in one of five views, which can help you
better understand the layout, margins, and page breaks in your document:
 Print Layout: Displays page breaks as thick, dark horizontal bars so you
can clearly see where a page ends and begins. (This is the default view.)
 Full Screen Reading: Displays pages side by side so you see.
 Web Layout: Displays your document exactly as it would appear if you
saved it as a Web page (looks similar to Page Layout view).
 Outline (also called Master Document Tools): Displays your document
as outline headings and subheadings.
 Draft: Displays the document without top or bottom page margins
where page breaks appear as dotted lines.
55
Chapter 4: Typing Text in Word

Switching between views
Microsoft Word gives you two ways to switch between different document
views, as shown in Figure 4-2:
 Click the view icons in the bottom of your document window.
 Click the View tab and then click the view you want to use, such as Print
Layout view.
Print Layout and Web Layout views look nearly identical, while Draft view 
displays your document without displaying page margins to make it easier
for you to view and edit data. The two most unusual views are Full Screen
Reading and Outline views.

Using Full Screen Reading view
Full Screen Reading view makes documents appear side by side like the pages
of a book, as shown in Figure 4-3. To “turn the pages” of a document displayed
in Full Screen Reading view, choose one of the following:
 Click the Previous Screen or Next Screen button.
 Click the Jump to a Page icon.
To exit Full Screen Reading view, choose one of the following:
 Press Esc.
 Click the Print Layout button.

Chapter 4: Typing Text in Word

Using Outline view
Outline view divides a document into sections defined by headings and text.
A heading represents a main idea. Text contains one or more paragraphs that
are “attached” to a particular heading. A subheading lets you divide a main
idea (heading) into multiple parts. A typical outline might look like Figure 4-4.

ings, and

can expand
or collapse
to hide sub-
headings or
text from
view.
58
Part II: Working with Word 

Within Outline view you can
 Collapse headings to hide parts (subheadings and text) temporarily
from view.
 Rearrange headings to move subheadings and text easily within a large
document.
Moving a heading automatically moves all subheadings and text. Instead of
cutting and pasting multiple paragraphs, Outline view lets you rearrange a
document by just moving headings around.
To switch to Outline view, click the Outline View icon at the bottom of the
document window (or click the View tab and then click the Outline icon).
Defining a heading
Outline view considers each line as either a heading or text. To define a line
as either a heading style (Level 1 to Level 9) or text, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor on the line that you want to define as a heading or text.
2. Click in the Outline Level list box and choose a heading level, such as
Level 2.
Word displays Level 1 headings in large type to the far left margin. Level 2
headings appear in smaller type that’s slightly indented to the right, Level 3
headings appear in even smaller type that’s indented further to the right, and
so on, as shown in Figure 4-5.
To create a heading quickly, move the cursor to the end of an existing head-
ing and press Enter to create an identical heading. For example, if you put the
cursor at the end of a Level 3 heading and press Enter, Word creates a new
blank Level 3 heading.
Figure 4-5:
The nine
different
heading
levels

59
Chapter 4: Typing Text in Word

Promoting and demoting a heading
After you define a heading (such as a Level 1 or Level 3 heading), you can
always change its level, such as changing a Level 1 heading to a Level 2 heading
or vice versa. When you raise a heading from one level to another (such as
from Level 3 to Level 2), that’s promoting. When you lower a heading (such
as from Level 4 to Level 5), that’s demoting.
A Level 1 heading cannot be promoted because Level 1 is the highest head-
ing. Likewise, a Level 9 heading cannot be demoted because Level 9 is the
lowest heading.
To promote or demote a heading to a different level, follow these steps:
1. Using either the mouse or the keyboard, move the cursor to the head-
ing you want to promote or demote.
2. Choose one of the following methods:
• Click the Outline Level list box and click a level (such as Level 2).
• Press Tab (to promote) or Shift+Tab (to demote) the heading.
• Click the Promote or Demote arrow.
• Move the mouse pointer over the circle that appears to the left of
the heading, hold down the left mouse button, drag the mouse
right or left, and then release the left mouse button.
You can convert a heading to a Level 1 heading quickly by just clicking the
Promote to Heading 1 arrow.
Promoting or demoting a heading moves any subheadings or text attached to
the promoted or demoted heading.
Moving headings
You can move headings up or down within a document. To move a heading,
follow these steps:
1. Using either the mouse or the keyboard, move the cursor to the head-
ing you want to promote or demote.
2. Choose one of the following methods:
• Click the Move Up or Move Down arrow.
• Press Alt+Shift+↑or Alt+Shift+↓.
• Move the mouse pointer over the circle that appears to the left of
the heading, hold down the left mouse button, drag the mouse up
or down, and then release the left mouse button.
60
Part II: Working with Word 

If you collapse a heading before moving it, you can move any subheadings or
text underneath that heading.
Creating text
Text can consist of a single sentence, multiple sentences, or several para-
graphs. Text always appears indented underneath a heading (or subheading).
To create text, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor to the end of a heading or subheading.
This is the heading (or subheading) that your text will be attached to if
you move the heading (or subheading).
2. Press Enter.
Word creates a blank heading.
3. Click the Demote to Body Text button.
Word displays a bullet indented underneath the heading you chose in
Step 1.
4. Type your text.
Collapsing and expanding headings and subheadings
If a heading or subheading contains any subheadings or text underneath, you
can collapse that heading. Collapsing a heading simply hides any indented
subheadings or text from view temporarily. Expanding a heading displays any
previously hidden subheadings or text.
To collapse a heading along with all subheadings or body text underneath it,
double-click the plus icon that appears to the left of the heading.
If you just want to collapse the subheading or body text immediately under-
neath a heading, choose one of the following:
 Move the cursor anywhere in the heading you want to collapse and then
click the Collapse button.
 Press Alt+Shift++ (plus sign key).
To expand a collapsed heading to reveal all subheadings and body text,
double-click the plus icon that appears to the left of the heading.
If you just want to expand the subheading or body text immediately under-
neath a collapsed heading, choose one of the following:
 Move the cursor anywhere in the heading you want to expand and then
click the Expand button.
 Press Alt+Shift+ – (minus sign key).

Chapter 4: Typing Text in Word

Navigating through a Document
If you have a large document that consists of many pages, you won’t be able
to see all the pages at the same time. Instead, you’ll have to scroll through
your document using either the mouse or the keyboard.
Navigating with the mouse
To scroll through a document with the mouse, you have two choices:
 Use the vertical scroll bar that appears on the right side of every docu-
ment window.
 Use the scroll wheel of your mouse (assuming that your mouse has a
scroll wheel).
Using the scroll bar
The scroll bar gives you multiple ways to navigate through a document, as
shown in Figure 4-6:

ment in one of two ways:
 Move the mouse pointer over your document and roll the scroll wheel
up or down.
 Move the mouse pointer over your document and click the scroll wheel;
then move the mouse up or down. (The scrolling speeds up the farther
up or down you move the mouse from the position where you clicked
the scroll wheel.) Click the left mouse button or the scroll wheel to turn
off automatic scrolling when you’re done.
Using the Go To command
If you know the specific page number of your document that you want to
scroll to, you can jump to that page right away by using the Go To command.
To use the Go To command, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Editing icon, click the downward-pointing arrow to the

3. Click in the Enter Page Number text box and type a page number.
If you type a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (–) in front of a number, you
can scroll that many pages forward or backward from the currently dis-
played page. For example, if the displayed page is 5, typing –2 displays
page 3 and typing +12 displays page 17.
4. Click the Go To button.
Word displays your chosen page.
5. Click Close to make the Find and Replace dialog box disappear.
Finding and Replacing Text
To help you find text, Word offers a handy Find feature. Not only can this
Find feature search for a word or phrase, but it also offers a Replace option
so you can make Word find certain words and replace them with other words
automatically.
Using the Find command
The Find command can search for a single character, word, or a group of
words. To make searching faster, you can either search an entire document or
just a specific part of a document. To use the Find command, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Editing icon and then click the Find command.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears.
3. Click in the Find What text box and type a word or phrase to find.

8. Click Cancel to make the Find and Replace dialog box disappear.
Checking Your Spelling
As you type, Word tries to correct your spelling automatically. (Try it! Type
tjhe, and Word will automatically change it to the in the blink of an eye.) If
you type something that Word doesn’t recognize, it underlines it with a red
squiggly line.
Just because Word underlines a word doesn’t necessarily mean that the word
is spelled wrong. It could be a proper name, a foreign word, or just a word
that Word isn’t smart enough to recognize.
66
Part II: Working with Word 

To correct any words that Word underlines with a red squiggly line, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click any word underlined with a red squiggly line.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-9.
2. Choose one of the following:
• The word you want: Click the correct spelling of the word that
appears in bold in the pop-up menu.
• Ignore All: This tells Word to ignore this word throughout your 
document.
• Add to Dictionary: This tells Word to remember this word and
never flag it again as a misspelled word.

read your document to highlight other possible problems, such as misplaced
commas or correctly spelled words that may be used incorrectly. To make
Word proofread your document, follow these steps:
1. Click the Proofing icon at the bottom of the document window.
Word highlights a possible error and displays a pop-up menu offering
options similar to the options displayed in Figure 4-9.
2. Choose one of the following:
• What you want: Click the correct word that appears in bold in the
pop-up menu.
• Ignore Once: This tells Word to ignore this error.

A
fter you type text into a document, edit it, and check it for spelling or
grammatical errors, you’re ready to make it look pretty, a process known
as formatting text. A properly formatted document can make your text easy
to read, while a poorly formatted document can make even the best writing
difficult or confusing to read.
The Home tab groups Word’s formatting tools into three categories:
 Font: Defines the font, font size, color, highlighting, and style (bold, italic,
underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, and case)
 Paragraph: Defines justification (left, center, or right), line spacing,
shading, borders, indentation, formatting symbols, and list style 
(bullets, numbered, and outline)
 Styles: Displays predefined formatting that you can apply to your text
To format any text, you must follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to format.
2. Choose a formatting tool.

When you choose most formatting commands, that command stays on until
you turn it off by choosing the same command again.
As soon as you select text, Word displays the most commonly used format-
ting tools in a floating toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-1. You can click any icon
on this floating toolbar rather than click the same icon stored at the top of
the screen.
Changing the Font
The most common way to format text is to change the font. The font defines
the uniform style and appearance of letters such as Baskerville, Courier, 
Old English, or Stencil.
To change the font, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to change.
3. Click the Font list box.
A list of available fonts on your computer appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
4. Move the mouse pointer over each font.
Word temporarily changes your selected text (from Step 1) so you can
see how the currently highlighted font will look.
5. Click the font you want to use.
Word changes your text to appear in your chosen font.
As a general rule, try not to use more than three fonts in a document. If you
use too many fonts, the overall appearance can be annoying and distracting.
Not all computers have the same lists of fonts, so if you plan on sharing docu-
ments with others, stick with common fonts that everybody’s computer can
display.

Part II: Working with Word 

Changing the Font Size
The font changes the appearance of text, but the font size defines how big
(or small) the text may look. To change the font size, you have two choices:
 Select a numeric size from the Font Size list box.
 Choose the Grow Font/Shrink Font commands.
You can use both methods to change the font size of text. For example, you
may use the Font Size list box to choose an approximate size for your text,
and then use the Grow Font/Shrink Font commands to fine-tune the font size.
To change the font size, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to change.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Font Size list box and then click a number, such as 12 or 24,
as shown in Figure 5-3.
• Click the Grow Font or Shrink Font icon.

The text style defines the appearance of text in one or more of the follow-
ing ways:
 Bold: Press Ctrl+B.
 Italic: Press Ctrl+I.
 Underline: Press Ctrl+U.
 Strikethrough: This formatting draws a line through text.
 Subscript: Use this to create text that falls below the text line, as in the
2 in H2O.
 Superscript: Use this to create text that sits higher than the top of the
text line, as in the 2 in E = mc2.
To change the style of text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to change.
3. Click a Style icon, such as Bold or Underline.
4. Repeat Step 3 for each additional style you want to apply to your text
(such as italic and underlining).
If you select any style change without selecting any text, Word applies your
style changes to any new text you type from the cursor’s current position.

Changing Colors
Color can emphasize text. There are two ways to use color:
 Change the color of the text (Font color).
 Highlight the text with a different color (Text Highlight color).
Changing the color of text
When you change the color of text, you’re physically displaying a different
color for each letter. Normally, Word displays text in black, but you can
change the color to anything you want, such as bright red or dark green.
If you choose a light color for your text, it may be hard to read against a
white background.
To change the color of text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to color.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Font Color icon.
A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
4. Click a color.
Word displays your selected text (from Step 1) in your chosen color.
After you choose a color, that color appears directly on the Font Color icon.
Now you can select text and click directly on the Font Color icon (not the
downward-pointing arrow) to color your text.

Chapter 5: Formatting Text

Highlighting text
Highlighting text mimics coloring chunks of text with a highlighting marker
that students often use to emphasize passages in a book. To highlight text,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to highlight.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Text Highlight
Color icon.
A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.
4. Click a color.
Word highlights your selected text (from Step 2) in your chosen color.
5. Press Esc (or click the Text Highlight Color icon again) to turn off the
Text Highlight Color command.
To remove a highlight, select the text and choose the same color again.
If no text is selected and the Text Highlight Color currently displays a color
you want to use (such as yellow), you can click the Text Highlight Color icon
(not its downward-pointing arrow). This turns the mouse pointer into a
marker icon. Now you can select and highlight text in one step.
Justifying Text Alignment
Word can align text in one of four ways, as shown in Figure 5-6:
 Left: Text appears flush against the left margin but ragged on the right
margin.
 Center: Every line appears centered within the left and right margins.
Figure 5-5:

Part II: Working with Word 

 Right: Text appears flush against the right margin but ragged on the left
margin.
 Justified: Text appears flush against both the left and right margins.
To align text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Move the cursor anywhere in the text you want to align.
3. Click one of the alignment icons, such as Center or Justify.
Rather than click an alignment icon, you can use one of the alignment key-
stroke shortcuts as follows: Align Left (Ctrl+L), Center (Ctrl+E), Align Right
(Ctrl+R), or Justify (Ctrl+J).
Adjusting Line Spacing
Line spacing defines how close lines appear stacked on top of each other.
To change the line spacing of text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text that you want to adjust the line spacing.
3. Click the Line Spacing icon.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-6:

Chapter 5: Formatting Text

4. Click the line spacing you want, such as 1 (single spacing) or 3
(triple spacing).
If you click the More option in the pull-down menu, you can precisely define
your own line spacing, such as 2.75 or 3.13.
Making Lists
Word can organize and arrange text in three types of lists:
 Bullets (like this list)
 Numbering
 Multilevel list
You can create a list from scratch or convert existing text into a list. To create
a list from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Move the cursor where you want to create a list.
Figure 5-7:

78
Part II: Working with Word 

3. Click the Bullets, Numbering, or Multilevel List icon.
Word creates your list (bulleted or numbered).
4. Type your text and press Enter to create another blank item in your list.
5. Repeat Step 4 for each additional bullet or numbered item you want
to make.
If you have existing text, you can convert it into a list by following these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text you want to convert into a list.
3. Click the Bullets, Numbering, or Outline Numbering icon.
Word converts your selected text into your chosen list where each para-
graph appears as a separate item in the list.
Indenting list items
After you create a list, you may want to indent one list item underneath
another one. To indent an item in a list, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor anywhere in the text in the list item you want to indent.
2. Press the Home key to move the cursor to the front of the line.
3. Press the Tab key to indent an item to the right (or press the Shift+Tab
keystroke combination to indent an item to the left).
When you indent a list, Word changes the number or bullet style to set
the line apart from the rest of your list.
Converting list items back into text
If you have a list, you may want to convert one or more items back into ordi-
nary text. To convert a list item into plain text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the list items you want to convert into plain text.
3. Click the appropriate Bullets, Numbering, or Outline Numbering icon.
If you want to convert a bullet list item into text, you would click the
Bullets icon.
79
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

Customizing a list
When you create a bullet or numbered list, you can choose from a variety of
different styles. To choose a numbering style, follow these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of a list icon, such as
the Bullet or Numbering icon.
Make sure you don’t click the Numbering icon itself.
A pull-down menu appears listing all the different numbering styles
available, as shown in Figure 5-8.
2. Click the numbering style you want.
The next time you click the Numbering icon, Word will use the number-
ing style you chose.
The changes you make to the numbering or bullet style will only apply to
your current document.
Renumbering numbered lists
Number lists can cause special problems when dividing or copying them
because the numbering may get out of sequence, or you may want to start
numbering from a number other than one.
Figure 5-8:

Part II: Working with Word 

To change the starting number of a numbered list, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the item that you want to renumber.
If you want to renumber your entire list, right-click the first item at the
top of the numbered list.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-9.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Restart at 1: Changes the numbering of the current list item to 1,
the list item directly below to 2, and so on. (This option does not
appear if you right-click the first item in a number list.)
• Continue Numbering: Changes the number of the current list item to
one greater than the last numbered list item earlier in the document.
• Set Numbering Value: Displays the Set Numbering Value dialog box,
as shown in Figure 5-10, so you can change the current list item to
a specific number such as 34 or 89.

Using the Ruler
When you create a document, Word creates page margins automatically.
However, if you want to adjust the left and right page margins, or define
how far the Tab key indents text, you need to use the Ruler.
By default, Word hides the Ruler to avoid cluttering up the screen. To display
the Ruler, click the View Ruler icon, as shown in Figure 5-11.
To hide the Ruler from view, just click the View Ruler icon again.

Chapter 5: Formatting Text

Defining indentation with the Ruler
The two icons on the Ruler that define indentation are the First Line Indent
and the Hanging Indent icons. The First Line Indent icon defines the position
of (what else?) the first line of every paragraph. The Hanging Indent icon
defines the position of every line of text except for the first line, as shown in
Figure 5-13.
To define the first line and hanging indent, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the Ruler appears visible.
2. Select any text.
3. Move the mouse pointer over the Left Indent icon on the Ruler, hold
down the left mouse button, and drag (move) the mouse to the right.
Word displays a dotted vertical line to show you where the new indenta-
tion margin will be.
4. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the position of
the left indentation of your text.
5. Move the mouse pointer over the First Line Indent icon on the Ruler,
hold down the left mouse button, and drag (move) the mouse to the
right (or left).
Word displays a dotted vertical line to show you where the new first line
indentation will be.
6. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the position of
the first line indent position.
Showing Formatting Marks
If you need to precisely align text, you may want to display Word’s special for-
matting symbols. These symbols show you the exact position of spaces, tabs,
and the ends of paragraphs.

Chapter 5: Formatting Text

Using Format Painter
Formatting can be simple, such as underlining text, or fairly complicated,
such as underlining text while also changing its font and font size. After you
format one chunk of text a certain way, you may want to format other parts
of your document the exact same way.
Although you could take time to format text manually, it’s much easier to use
Format Painter instead. Format Painter tells Word, “See the way I formatted that
chunk of text over there? Apply that same formatting to a new chunk of text.”
To use Format Painter, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text that contains the formatting you want to copy.
3. Click the Format Painter icon, as shown in Figure 5-15.
4. Select the text that you want to format. (Move the mouse pointer over
the beginning of the text you want to format, hold down the left mouse
button, and drag the mouse until you reach the end of the text you
want to format.)
Word applies your formatting to your text.

86
Part II: Working with Word 

Using Styles
As an alternative to choosing fonts, font sizes, and text styles (like bold) indi-
vidually, Word offers several predefined formatting styles. To apply a style to
your text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text that you want to format.
3. Click the up/down arrows of the Styles scroll bar to scroll through the
different styles available. Or click the More button to display a pull-
down menu of all the Quick Formatting styles, as shown in Figure 5-16.
4. Move the mouse pointer over a style.
Word displays what your text will look like if you choose this style.
5. Click the style you want to use, such as Heading 1, Title, or Quote.
Word formats your text.
For another way to use a style, click on the diagonal button that appears
in the bottom-right corner of the Styles group. This will open a Styles
window that displays a list of available styles. (You can click on the close
box of the Styles window to make it go away when you’re done using it.)

Chapter 5: Formatting Text

Using Templates
In case you need to format an entire document a certain way, you may want
to use templates instead. Templates act like preformatted documents. Word
comes with several templates, but Microsoft offers several through its Web
site as well.
Creating a new document from a template
The easiest time to use a template is before you’ve typed any text. To create
a new document from a template, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose New.
A New Document window appears.
2. Click one of the following in the left pane of the New Document window:
• Installed Templates: Displays templates installed on your computer
• Any category under the Microsoft Office Online heading, such as
Brochures or Forms
The New Document window displays a list of available templates so you
can see how they format text, as shown in Figure 5-17. If you don’t
choose a template, Word chooses the Normal template by default.
Figure 5-17:
Templates

new docu-
ment based
on the for-
matting
of an
existing file.
88
Part II: Working with Word 

3. Click a template and then click Create or Download.
Word creates a blank document with “dummy” text to show you how the
formatting looks.
4. Type new text and use the Style icons to apply the predefined format-
ting from your template to your text.
Creating a document based 
on an existing document
If you already have a document that’s formatted perfectly, you may want to
use that document as a template for creating a new document. This essen-
tially copies an existing document, including all its text and formatting, and
creates a new document for you to edit and save under a new name.
To create a new document based on an existing one, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose New.
A New Document window appears.
2. Click the Featuring pane in the Installed Templates list.
3. Click New from Existing Document.
The New from Existing Document dialog box appears.
4. Click the file that contains the formatting you want to duplicate in a
new document.
5. Click Create New.
Word displays a copy of the file you chose in Step 4.
6. Save this document under a new name and edit the current text.
Removing Formatting from Text
After you format text, you can always remove that formatting. The simplest
way to do this is to apply the same formatting you want to remove. For exam-
ple, if you underline text, you can remove the underlining by highlighting all
the underlined text and choosing the underline command (by pressing Ctrl+U
or by clicking the Underline icon).
89
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

If you want to remove multiple formatting from text, you could remove each
formatting style one by one, but it’s much easier just to use the Clear Formatting
command instead, which removes all formatting on text no matter how much
formatting there may be.
To use the Clear Formatting command, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the text that contains the formatting you want to remove.
3. Click the Clear Formatting icon, as shown in Figure 5-18.
Word removes all formatting from your selected text.
The Clear Formatting command will not remove any highlighting you
may have applied over text.

T
o design the overall layout of your pages by adding columns or headers
and footers that display titles or page numbers, you use the Insert and
Page Layout tabs.
The Insert tab provides commands for inserting items into a document, such
as new pages, tables, pictures, and headers and footers.
The Page Layout tab provides commands for defining how your pages look,
such as creating columns; defining top, bottom, left, and right page margins;
as well as defining how text wraps around pictures or other objects you place
in the middle of a page.
Inserting New Pages
Word automatically adds new pages to your document as you write. However,
Word also gives you the option of adding a new page in the middle or the
beginning of your document.
To insert a new, blank page in your document, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Move the cursor where you want to insert the new page.

3. Click the Page Break icon in the Pages group.
Word adds a blank page to your document.
You don’t need to add a page to the end of a document. Just move the cursor
to the end of your document (Ctrl+End), start typing, and Word adds new
pages at the end of your document automatically.
Adding (And Deleting) a Cover Page
Rather than add more pages to type text, you may just need a cover page that
is the first page that anyone can read. To create a cover page, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Cover Page icon in the Pages group.
Word displays a list of cover page designs, as shown in Figure 6-1.
3. Click a cover page design.
Word adds your chosen cover page as the first page of your document.
A document can have only one cover page at a time. If you choose another
cover page, Word deletes your current cover page and replaces it with the
new one you chose.
After you add a cover page, you may want to delete it later. To delete a cover
page, follow these steps:
Figure 6-1:
Word can
insert a
variety of

92
Part II: Working with Word 

1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click Cover Page in the Pages group.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 6-1).
3. Choose Remove Current Cover Page.
Word deletes your cover page.
Inserting Page Breaks
Rather than insert a new page, you may want to break text on an existing page
into two pages. To insert a page break in your document, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Move the cursor where you want to break your document into two
pages.
3. Click the Page Break icon in the Pages group.
Word breaks your document into two pages.
To delete a page break, move the cursor to the top of the page directly follow-
ing the page break you want to delete. Then press Backspace.
As an alternative to following Steps 2 and 3 in the preceding step list, you
can just press Ctrl+Enter to create a page break at the cursor’s current 
location.
Inserting Headers and Footers
Headers and footers appear at the top (headers) and bottom (footers) on one
or more pages of your document. Headers and footers can display informa-
tion such as titles, chapter names, dates, and page numbers.
Creating a header (or footer)
To create a header or footer, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Header or Footer icon in the Header & Footer group.
A pull-down menu appears.
93
Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

3. Click Edit header (or Edit footer).
Word displays your header or footer.
Headers and footers are visible only when you display a document in
Print Layout view.
4. Type, edit, or delete any text you want to change.
6. (Optional) Click the Date & Time or Page Number icons of the
Design contextual tools to insert the date and time or page numbers,
respectively.
7. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
Word dims your header and footer text.
Defining which pages to display 
a header (or footer)
Usually when you define a header or footer, Word displays that header or
footer on every page of your document. However, Word gives you the option
of displaying a different header and footer for your first page only, or display-
ing different headers and footers for odd and even pages.
Creating a unique header or footer for your first page
Often, you want a header or footer to display page numbers and document or
chapter titles — just not on the first page of your document. To create a unique
header or footer that appears only on your first page, follow these steps:
1. Switch to Print Layout view (click the View tab and click Print Layout,
or click the Print Layout icon near the bottom-right corner of the
screen).
2. Click the Insert tab, click the Header icon in the Header & Footer
group, and choose Edit Header.
The Design tab appears.
3. Select the Different First Page check box in the Options group.
Word displays a header or footer with the name First Page Header
or First Page Footer.
4. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
Word dims your header and footer text.
You can clear the Different First Page check box to keep Word from displaying
your separate first page header and footer.
94
Part II: Working with Word 

Creating unique headers and footers for odd and even pages
Sometimes you may want different headers or footers to appear on even or
odd pages. In most books, even page numbers (headers) appear in the upper-
left corner while odd page numbers (headers) appear in the upper-right
corner. To create this effect in your own documents, you need to create 
different headers to appear on odd and even pages.
To create a different header or footer for even and odd numbered pages,
follow these steps:
1. Switch to Print Layout view (click the View tab and click Print Layout,
or click the Print Layout icon near the bottom-right corner of the
screen).
2. Click the Insert tab, click the Header icon in the Header & Footer
group, and choose Edit Header.
The Design tab appears.
3. Select the Different Odd & Even Pages check box in the Options
group.
Word displays a header or footer with the name Odd Page Header or
Even Page Footer.
4. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
5. Switch to another page and repeat Steps 2 through 4 to define the
other odd or even header.
If an odd page number originally appeared in Step 1, switch to an even
page number (or vice versa).
You can clear the Different Odd & Even Pages check box to keep Word from
displaying your separate odd and even page headers and footers.
Deleting a header (or footer)
In case you want to get rid of a header or footer, you can always delete it by
following these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Switch to Print Layout view (click the View tab and click Print Layout, or
click the Print Layout icon near the bottom-right corner of the screen).
3. Click the Header or Footer icon in the Header & Footer group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Click Remove Header (or Remove Footer).
Word removes your header or footer.

Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

Organizing Text in Tables
Tables organize text into rows and columns, which can make it easy to type,
edit, and format text while spacing it correctly in your document. Tables
organize text in cells, where a cell is the intersection of a row and a column.
Word provides four ways to create a table:
 Click the Insert tab, click the Table icon, and then highlight the number
of rows and columns for your table (up to a maximum of eight rows and
ten columns).
 Use the Insert Table dialog box.
 Draw the size and position of the table with the mouse.
 Convert existing text (divided by a delimiter character such as a Tab or
comma).
Creating a table by highlighting 
rows and columns
Creating a table by highlighting rows and columns can be fast, but it limits
the size of your table to a maximum of eight rows and ten columns. To create
a table by highlighting rows and columns, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In your document, move the cursor where you want to insert a table.
3. Click the Table icon.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.

you want to create for your table.
When you highlight rows and columns, Word displays your table
directly in your document so you can see exactly what your table
will look like.
5. Click the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your
table.
Creating a table with the 
Insert Table dialog box
Creating a table by highlighting the number of rows and columns can be
fast, but it limits the size of your table to a maximum of eight rows and
ten columns. To create a table by defining a specific number of rows and
columns (up to a maximum of 63 columns) and a column width, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Move the cursor where you want to insert a table.
3. Click the Table icon.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 6-2).
4. Click Insert Table.

appear.
5. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size and
position of your table.
6. Move the mouse pointer to the top/bottom or left/right side of the
table, hold down the left mouse button, and drag (move) the mouse up
and down (or right and left) to draw the boundaries for your table’s
rows and columns.
7. Press Esc or double-click to turn the mouse pointer from a pencil icon
back to an I-beam pointer.
Creating a table from existing text
If you have existing text that you’d like to turn into a table, you need to first
separate text into chunks so Word knows how to place the text into individ-
ual cells in a table. To define how text appears in a table, Word uses the fol-
lowing criteria:
 Paragraphs appear in separate rows.
See the top example in Figure 6-5. You can change the delimiter charac-
ter to commas, tabs, or any other character, such as # or *.
 Tabbed text appears in separate columns, as in the bottom example of
Figure 6-5.

Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

Formatting and Coloring a Table
After you create a table, you can format individual cells (the intersection of a
row and column) or entire rows and columns by aligning text in cells, resizing
columns and rows, and adding borders, shading, or colors, all of which can
make the text inside easier to read.
Selecting all or part of a table
To format and color a table, you must first select the table, row, column, or
cell that you want to modify. To select all or part of a table, follow these steps:
1. Click in the table, row, column, or cell you want to modify.
The Table Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Layout tab.
3. Click Select in the Table group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.

Aligning text in a table cell
You can align text in a table cell in nine different ways: Top Left (the default
alignment), Top Center, Top Right, Center Left, Center, Center Right, Bottom
Left, Bottom Center, and Bottom Right, as shown in Figure 6-10.
To align one or more cells, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell that contains text that you want to align.
The Table Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Layout tab.
3. Click an alignment icon in the Alignment group (refer to Figure 6-10)
such as Top Right or Bottom Center.
Word aligns your text. If you changed the alignment of blank cells, any
new text you type in those blank cells will appear according to the align-
ment you chose.

Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

Coloring all or part of a table
Colors can make the text inside rows and columns easier to read, such as col-
oring every other row. To color all or part of a table, follow these steps:
1. Select a table, row, column, or cell that you want to modify by follow-
ing the steps in the earlier section, “Selecting all or part of a table.”
Word highlights your chosen table, row, column, or cell.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab that appears under the Table
Tools tab.
3. Click Shading.
A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 6-11.
4. Move the mouse pointer over a color.
Word automatically displays your chosen color in the selected part of
your table. Each time you point to a different color, Word displays a dif-
ferent color in the table.
5. Click a color in the palette when you’re happy with a particular color.
Adding borders
Borders can emphasize parts of your table, such as a particular row or
column. To add a border to a table, you need to define the following:
 Where you want the border to appear (on the bottom of a row, on the
left of a cell, on the top of a column, and so on)
 The border color
 The border line style
 The border line thickness
To add a border, follow these steps:

Picking a table style
By coloring rows or columns and adding borders, you can customize the
appearance of your tables. However, for a faster method, you can just use a
predesigned table style instead, which can automatically format your text,
color rows, and add borders to your tables.
To choose a table style, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor inside the table you want to modify.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab.
3. (Optional) Click or clear check boxes under the Table Style Options
group, such as the Header Row or Last Column check box.

Part II: Working with Word 

5. Click a table style.
Word formats your table according to the style you chose.
Resizing columns and rows
You may need to resize a column or row in your table to expand or shrink it
so your text doesn’t appear crowded or surrounded by empty space. You can
resize a column or row by using the mouse or by defining row heights and
column widths.
To resize a row or column with the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse over the row or column border that you want to resize.
The mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold the left mouse button down and drag (move) the mouse to resize
the row or column.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size of the
row or column.
Figure 6-15:
The Table
Styles group
displays
different
ways to
format your
table.
107
Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

Using the mouse to resize a row or column can be fast, but if you want to
resize a row or column to a specific height or width, you can type in the spe-
cific dimensions by following these steps:
1. Select the row, column, or table that you want to modify. (If you select
the entire table, you can adjust the width or height of rows and
columns for your entire table.)
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab (refer to Figure 6-10).
If you want to define the width or height of multiple rows or columns
equally, click the Distribute Columns or Distribute Rows icon.
3. To precisely define a column’s width, click the Width list box and type
a value (or click the up/down arrows to choose a value).
4. To precisely define a row’s height, click the Height list box and type a
value (or click the up/down arrows to choose a value).
5. (Optional) Click AutoFit and choose one of the following:
• AutoFit Contents: Shrinks your columns or rows to largest cell
• AutoFit Window: Expands the table to fit the width of the current
document window
Defining cell margins
Another way to modify the appearance of a table is to change the space
that appears between items in a cell, known as the cell margin. Cell margins
simply add blank space between text and cell borders. To define cell margins
in a table, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor inside any cell in the table you want to modify.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Cell Margins icon in the Alignment group.
The Table Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-16.
Figure 6-16:
The Table
Options
dialog box

108
Part II: Working with Word 

4. Click in the Top, Bottom, Left, or Right text box and type a value
(or click the up/down arrows to increase or decrease the currently
displayed value).
5. Click OK.
Word displays your table with text moved away from the borders, as
shown in Figure 6-17.
Defining cell spacing
Defining cell margins can move text away from cell borders to make a table
easier to read. For another way to separate cells in a table, you can define the
cell spacing. The greater the cell spacing, the farther apart individual cells
appear from one another, as shown in Figure 6-18.
To define cell spacing in a table, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor inside any cell in the table you want to modify.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Cell Margins icon in the Alignment group.
The Table Options dialog box appears (refer to Figure 6-16).

4. Select the Allow Spacing between Cells check box and type a value
(or click the up/down arrows to increase or decrease the currently
displayed value).
5. Click OK.
Word displays your table with cells spaced apart.
Splitting (and merging) cells
Splitting a cell divides the cell into multiple rows or columns. Merging cells
combines two or more cells to create one big cell. Splitting or merging calls
typically creates unusual tables without uniform rows and columns, as shown
in Figure 6-19.
To split a cell, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor to the cell you want to divide in half.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Split Cells icon in the Merge group.
The Split Cells dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-20.

6. Click OK.
Word splits your cell into the number of rows and columns you defined
in Steps 4 and 5.
To merge cells, follow these steps:
1. Select adjacent cells that you want to merge into a single cell.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Merge Cells icon in the Merge group.
Word merges your selected cells into one big cell.
Sorting a Table
Tables can not only organize data, but they can also sort your data alphabeti-
cally as well. To sort a table, you need to specify a single column of data to
sort. When Word sorts the data in this column, it automatically sorts every
row in the table as well, as shown in Figure 6-21.
To sort a table, follow these steps:
1. Select the column that contains the data you want to sort.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Sort icon in the Data group.
The Sort dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-22.

sort: Text, Number, or Date.
5. Select either the Ascending or Descending radio button.
6. Click OK.
Word sorts your entire table based on the data in the column you selected.
Deleting Tables
After you create a table, you can delete the entire table, delete one or more
rows or columns, or just delete individual cells along with their data.
Deleting an entire table
Word gives you two choices in deleting a table. First, you can wipe out just
the data inside the table while leaving the table itself intact. Second, you can
wipe out both the data and the table at the same time.
To delete just the data in a table, follow these steps:
1. Select every row and column in the table.
2. Press Delete.
Word wipes out all your data and leaves an empty table.
Figure 6-22:
The Sort
dialog box
lets you
specify
whether to
sort by
ascending
or descend-
ing order.
112
Part II: Working with Word 

To delete both your table and all the data stored in it at the same time, follow
these steps:
1. Move the cursor into the table you want to wipe out.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Delete icon in the Rows & Columns group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-23.
4. Choose Delete Table.
Word wipes out your table and all the data stored in it.
Deleting rows and columns
Rather than delete an entire table, you can also delete rows and columns.
When you delete a row or column, you wipe out any data stored inside that
row or column.
To delete a row or column, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor into the row or column you want to delete.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Delete icon.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 6-23).
4. Choose Delete Columns or Delete Rows.

Chapter 6: Designing Your Pages

Deleting cells
You can delete data in cells just by selecting the data and pressing the Delete
key. If you want to delete data and the cell itself, you have two options:
 Delete a cell and shift adjacent rows or columns. This creates an odd-
shaped table.
 Delete the data and cell borders. This keeps the table symmetrical but
often merges cells.
To delete a cell and change the physical layout of a table, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or cells you want to delete.
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
3. Click the Delete icon in the Rows & Columns group.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 6-23).
4. Choose Delete Cells.
The Delete Cells dialog box appears.
5. Select the radio button for Shift Cells Left or Shift Cells Up.
6. Click OK.
Word deletes your chosen cells and shifts cells left or up, creating an
odd-shaped table in the process, as shown in Figure 6-24.
Figure 6-24:

b. Release the left mouse button.
Word deletes the selected cell lines and any data stored in adjacent
cells.
5. Press Esc or double-click the mouse to turn off the Eraser and convert
the mouse pointer back into an I-beam cursor.
Making Text Look Artistic
To spice up the appearance of individual paragraphs, Word lets you add drop
caps, text boxes, or WordArt. Drop caps make the first letter of a paragraph
appear huge. WordArt displays text as graphical images. Text boxes let you
display chunks of text in separate boxes that you can arrange anywhere in
your document.
Creating drop caps

Previewing a Document before Printing
Before you print your document, you may want to preview how it will look so
you don’t waste paper printing something you can’t use anyway. After you
see that your pages will look perfect, then you can finally print out your document
for everyone to read.
Defining page size and orientation
If you need to print your documents on different sizes of paper, you may need to
define the page size and paper orientation. By doing this, Word can accurately
show you what your text may look like when printed on an 8.5" x 11" page
compared with an 8.27" x 11.69" page.
To define the Page Size, follow these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.

Playing the
Numbers 
with Excel

In this part . . .
I
f adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing long lists
of numbers sounds scary, relax. Microsoft endowed
Office 2007 with the world’s most popular spreadsheet
program, dubbed Microsoft Excel. By using Excel, you can
create budgets, track inventories, calculate future profits
(or losses), and design bar, line, and pie charts so you can
see what your numbers are really trying to tell you.
Think of Excel as your personal calculating machine that
plows through your numbers for you — whether you need
to manage something as simple as a home budget or some-
thing as wonderfully complex as an annual profit-and-loss
statement for a Fortune 500 corporation.
By tracking numbers, amounts, lengths, measurements, or
money with Excel, you can quickly predict future trends
and likely results. Type in your annual salary along with
any business expenses you have, and you can calculate
how much income tax your government plans to steal
from you in the future. Or play “What if?” games with your
numbers and ask questions such as “Which sales region
sells the most useless products?” “How much can I avoid
paying in taxes if my income increases by 50 percent?” and
“If my company increases sales, how much of an annual
bonus can I give myself while letting my employees starve
on minimum wages?”
So if you want to get started crunching numbers, this is
the part of the book that shows you how to use Excel
effectively.

veryone needs to perform simple math. Businesses need to keep track of
sales and profits, and individuals need to keep track of budgets. In the
old days, people not only had to write down numbers on paper, but they also
had to do all their calculations by hand (or with the aid of a calculator).
That’s why people use Excel. Instead of writing numbers on paper, they can
type numbers on the computer. Instead of adding or subtracting columns or
rows of numbers by hand, Excel can do it for you automatically. Basically,
Excel makes it easy to type and modify numbers and then calculate new
results accurately and quickly.
Understanding Spreadsheets
Excel organizes numbers in rows and columns. An entire page of rows and
columns is called a spreadsheet or a worksheet. (A collection of one or more
worksheets is stored in a file called a workbook.) Each row is identified by a
number such as 1 or 249; and each column is identified by letters, such as A, G,
or BF. The intersection of each row and column defines a cell, which contains
one of three items:
 Numbers
 Text (labels)
 Formulas

Numbers provide the data, and formulas calculate that data to produce a
useful result, such as adding sales results for the week. Of course, just dis-
playing numbers on the screen may be confusing if you don’t know what
those numbers mean, so labels simply identify what numbers represent.
Figure 7-1 shows the parts of a typical spreadsheet.
Formulas usually appear as numbers, so at first glance, it may be difficult to
tell the difference between ordinary numbers and numbers that represent a
calculation by a formula.
The strength of spreadsheets comes by playing “What-if?” games with your
data, such as “What if I gave myself a $20-per-hour raise and cut everyone
else’s salary by 25%? How much money would that save the company every
month?” Because spreadsheets can rapidly calculate new results, you can
experiment with different numbers to see how they create different answers.
Storing Stuff in a Spreadsheet
Every cell can contain a number, a label, or a formula. To type anything into a
spreadsheet, you must first select or click in the cell (or cells) and then type
a number or text.
Typing data into a single cell
To type data in a single cell, follow these steps:
Labels

Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

1. Choose one of the following to select a single cell:
• Click a cell.
• Press the up/down/right/left arrow keys to highlight a cell.
2. Type a number (such as 34.29 or 198), a label (such as Tax Returns), or
a formula.
You can see how to create formulas in Chapter 8.
Typing data in multiple cells
After you type data in a cell, you can press one of the following four key-
strokes to select a different cell:
 Enter: Selects the cell below in the same column
 Tab: Selects the cell to the right in the same row
 Shift+Enter: Selects the cell above in the same column
 Shift+Tab: Selects the cell to the left in the same row
If you type data in cell A1 and press Enter, Excel selects the next cell below,
which is A2. If you type data in A2 and press Tab, Excel selects the cell to the
right, which is B2.
However, what if you want to type data in a cell such as A1 and then have Excel
select the next cell to the right (B1)? Or what if you want to type data in cells
A1 and A2 but then jump back up to type additional data in cells B1 and B2?
To make doing this easy, Excel lets you select a range of cells, which essentially
tells Excel, “See all the cells I just highlighted? I only want to type data in those
cells.” After you select multiple cells, you can type data and press Enter.
Excel selects the next cell down in that same column. When Excel reaches
the last cell in the column, it selects the top cell of the column to the right.
To select multiple cells for typing data in, follow these steps:
1. Highlight multiple cells by choosing one of the following:
• Move the mouse pointer over a cell, hold down the left mouse
button, and drag (move) the mouse to highlight multiple cells.
Release the left mouse button when you’ve selected enough cells.
• Hold down the Shift key and press the up/down/right/left arrow
keys to highlight multiple cells. Release the Shift key when you’ve
selected enough cells.
Excel selects the cell that appears in the upper-left corner of your
selected cells.
2. Type a number, label, or formula.
129
Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

3. Press Enter.
Excel selects the cell directly below the previous cell. If the previous cell
appeared at the bottom of the selected column, Excel highlights the top
cell in the column that appears to the right.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you fill your selected cells with data.
5. Click outside the selected cells or press an arrow key to tell Excel not
to select the cells any more.
Typing in sequences with AutoFill
If you need to type the names of successive months or days in a row or
column (such as January, February, March, and so on), Excel offers a short-
cut to save you from typing all the day or month names yourself. With this
shortcut, you just type one month or day and then drag the mouse to high-
light all the adjacent cells. Then Excel types the rest of the month or day
names in those cells automatically.
To use this shortcut, follow these steps:
1. Click a cell and type a month (like January or just Jan) or a day (like
Monday or just Mon).
The Fill Handle, a block box, appears in the bottom-right corner of the cell.
You can also type in a sequence of numbers in Step 1. So if you typed the
numbers 2, 4, and 6 in adjacent cells, highlighted all these adjacent cells,
and grabbed the Fill Handle, Excel is smart enough to detect the pattern
and display the numbers 8, 10, and 12 in the next three adjacent cells.
2. Move the mouse pointer over the Fill Handle until the mouse pointer
turns into a black crosshair icon.
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse down a
column or across the row.
As you drag the mouse, Excel automatically types in the remaining
month or day names, as shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2:
By dragging
the Fill
Handle,
Excel enters
the names of
the month or
days auto-
matically.

Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Formatting Numbers and Labels
When you first create a spreadsheet, numbers and labels appear as plain text.
Plain labels might look boring, but plain numbers (such as 8495 or 0.39) can
be difficult to read and understand if the numbers are supposed to represent
currency amounts ($8,495) or percentages (39%).
To make labels visually interesting and numbers appear more descriptive of
what they actually represent, you need to format your data after you type it
into a spreadsheet.
You can format a cell or range of cells after you’ve already typed in data or
before you type in any data. If you format cells before typing any data, any
data you type in will appear in your chosen format.
Formatting numbers
To format the appearance of numbers, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more cells using the mouse or keyboard.
To select multiple cells, drag the mouse or hold the Shift key while
pressing the arrow keys.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Number Format list box in the Number group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3:
The Number
Format list
box lists the
different
ways you
can format
the appear-
ance of
numbers.
131
Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

The Number group also displays three icons that let you format num-
bers as Currency, Percentage, or with Commas in one click, as shown in
Figure 7-4. If you click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the
Accounting Number Format icon, you can choose different currency
symbols to use such as $, £, or €.
4. Click a number format style, such as Percentage or Scientific.
Excel displays your numbers in your chosen format.
Displaying negative numbers
Because many people use spreadsheets for business, they often want negative
numbers to appear highlighted so they can see them easier. Excel can display
negative numbers in parentheses (–23) or in red so you can’t miss them.
To define how negative numbers appear in your spreadsheet, follow these
steps:
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to modify.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Format icon in the Cells group.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
4. Choose Cells.
The Format Cells dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
5. Choose Currency or Number from the Category list.
You can choose how to format negative numbers only if you format your
numbers using the Currency or Number category.
Figure 7-4:

6. Click a negative number format and then click OK.
If any of your numbers become negative in the cell or cells you selected
in Step 1, Excel automatically displays those negative numbers in the
negative number format you chose.

Formatting decimal numbers
If you format cells to display numbers with decimal places, such as 23.09 or
23.09185, you can modify how many decimal places appear. To define the
number of decimal places, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or cells that contain the numbers you want to format.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click in the Number Format list box (refer to Figure 7-3) and choose a
format that displays decimal places, such as Number or Percentage.
Excel formats the numbers in your chosen cells.
You can click the Increase Decimal (increases the number of decimal places
displayed) or Decrease Decimal icon (decreases the number of decimal
places displayed), as shown in Figure 7-7.
Formatting cells
To make your data look prettier, Excel can format the appearance of cells to
change the font, background color, text color, or font size used to display
data in a cell.
Excel provides two ways to format cells: You can use Excel’s built-in format-
ting styles, or you can apply different types of formatting individually. Some
of the individual formatting styles you can choose include
 Font and font size
 Text styles (underlining, italic, and bold)
 Text and background color
 Borders
 Alignment
 Text wrapping and orientation
Figure 7-7:

Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Formatting cells with built-in styles
Excel provides a variety of predesigned formatting styles that you can apply
to one or more cells. To format cells with a built-in style, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to format with a built-in style.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Cell Styles icon in the Styles group.
A pull-down menu appears listing all the different styles you can choose,
as shown in Figure 7-8.
4. Move the mouse pointer over a style.
Excel displays a Live Preview of how your selected cells will look with
that particular style.
5. Click the style you want.
Excel applies your chosen style to the selected cells.
Formatting fonts and text styles
Different fonts can emphasize parts of your spreadsheet, such as using one
font to label columns and rows and another font or font size to display the
actual data. Text styles (bold, underline, and italic) can also emphasize data
that appears in the same font or font size.
To change the font, font size, and text style of one or more cells, follow these
steps:
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to change the font and font size.
Figure 7-8:
The Cell
Styles menu
offers differ-
ent ways to
format your
cells quickly.

2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Font list box.
A pull-down menu of different fonts appears.
4. Click the font you want to use.
5. Choose one of the following methods to change the font size:
• Click the Font Size list box and then choose a font size, such as
12 or 16.
• Click the Font Size list box and type a value such as 7 or 15.
• Click the Increase Font Size or Decrease Font Size icon until your
data appears in the size you want.
6. Click one or more text style icons (Bold, Italic, Underline).
Formatting with color
Each cell displays data in a Font color and a Fill color. The Font color defines
the color of the numbers and letters that appear inside a cell. (The default
Font color is black.) The Fill color defines the color that fills the background
of the cell. (The default Fill color is white.)
To change the Font and Fill colors of cells, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to color.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Font Color icon.
A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 7-9.
4. Click the color you want to use for your text.
The color you select appears directly on the Font Color icon. The next
time you want to apply this same color to a cell, you can click the Font
Color icon directly instead of the downward-pointing arrow to the right
of the Font Color icon.
5. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Fill Color icon.
A color palette appears.
6. Click a color to use to fill the background of your cell.
The color you select appears directly on the Fill Color icon. The next
time you want to apply this same color to a cell, you can click the Fill
Color icon directly instead of the downward-pointing arrow to the right
of the Fill Color icon.
136
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Adding borders
For another way to highlight one or more cells, you can add borders. Borders
can surround the entire cell or just the top, bottom, left, or right side of a cell.
To add borders to a cell, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more cells.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Border icon.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-10.

Navigating a Spreadsheet
If you have a large spreadsheet, chances are good that information may be
hidden by the limitations of your computer screen. To help you view and
select cells in different parts of your spreadsheet, Excel offers various ways
to navigate a spreadsheet using the mouse and keyboard.
Using the mouse to move around 
in a spreadsheet
To navigate a spreadsheet with the mouse, you can click the scroll bars or
use the scroll wheel on your mouse, if you have one. To use the scroll bars,
you have three choices:
 Click the up/down or right/left arrows on the horizontal or vertical
scroll bars.
This moves the spreadsheet one row (up or down) or column (right or left)
at a time.
 Drag the scroll box of a scroll bar.
 Click the scroll area (any area to the left/right or above/below the
scroll box on the scroll bar).
This moves the spreadsheet one screen left/right or up/down.
If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use this wheel to move through a
spreadsheet by two methods:
 Roll the mouse’s scroll wheel up or down to scroll your spreadsheet up
or down.
 Press the scroll wheel to display a four-way pointing arrow, then move
the mouse up, down, right, or left. (When you’re done, click the scroll
wheel again.)
Using the keyboard to move 
around a spreadsheet
Using the mouse can be faster to jump from one place in a spreadsheet to
another, but sometimes using the mouse can be frustrating, trying to line it
up just right. For that reason, you can also use the keyboard to move around
a spreadsheet. Some of the common ways to move around a spreadsheet are
shown in Table 7-1.

1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click Go To.
The Go To dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-11.
You can also choose the Go To command by pressing Ctrl+G.
4. Click in the Reference text box and type the cell you want to move to,
such as C13 or F4.
5. Click OK.
Excel highlights the cell you typed in Step 4.
139
Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

Naming cells
One problem with the Go To command is that most people won’t know which
cell contains the data they want to find. For example, if you want to view the
cell that contains your total amount of money you owe for your income taxes,
you probably don’t want to memorize that this cell is G68.
To help you identify certain cells, Excel lets you give them descriptive names.
To name a cell or range of cells, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to name.
2. Click in the Name box, as shown in Figure 7-12.
3. Type a descriptive name without any spaces and then press Enter.

After you name a cell, you can jump to it quickly by following these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Name box.
A list of named cells appears.
2. Click the named cell you want to view.
Excel displays your chosen cell.
Eventually, you may want to edit or delete a name for your cells. To delete or
edit a name, follow these steps:
1. Click the Formulas tab.
2. Click the Name Manager icon.
The Name Manager dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-13.
3. Edit or delete the named cell as follows:
• To edit the name, click the cell name you want to edit and then
click the Edit button. An Edit Name dialog box appears, where
you can change the name or the cell reference.
• To delete the name, click the cell name you want to delete and
then click the Delete button.

Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

Searching a Spreadsheet
Rather than search for a specific cell, you may want to search for a particular
label or number in a spreadsheet. Excel lets you search for the following:
 Specific text or numbers
 All cells that contain formulas
 All cells that contain conditional formatting
Searching for text
You can search for a specific label or number anywhere in your spreadsheet.
To search for text or numbers, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click Find.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-14.
If you click the Replace tab, you can define the text or number to find
and new text or numbers to replace it.
4. Click in the Find What text box and type the text or number you want
to find.
If you click the Options button, the Find and Replace dialog box expands
to provide additional options for searching, such as searching in the dis-
played sheet or the entire workbook.
5. Click one of the following:
Figure 7-14:
The Find
and Replace
dialog box
lets you
search your
worksheet.
142
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

• Find Next: Finds and selects the first cell, starting from the cur-
rently selected cell that contains the text you typed in Step 4
• Find All: Finds and lists all cells that contain the text you typed in
Step 4, as shown in Figure 7-15
6. Click Close to make the Find and Replace dialog box go away.
Searching for formulas
Formulas appear just like numbers; to help you find which cells contain for-
mulas, Excel gives you two choices:
 Display formulas in your cells (instead of numbers)
 Highlight the cells that contain formulas
To display formulas in a spreadsheet, press Ctrl+` (an accent grave character,
which appears on the same key as the ~ sign and often appears to the left of
the number 1 key near the top of a keyboard). Figure 7-16 shows what a
spreadsheet looks like when formulas appear inside of cells.

Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

To highlight all cells that contain formulas, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click Formulas.
Excel highlights all the cells that contain formulas.
Editing a Spreadsheet
The two ways to edit a spreadsheet are
 Edit the data itself, such as the labels, numbers, and formulas that make
up a spreadsheet.
 Edit the physical layout of the spreadsheet, such as adding or deleting
rows and columns, or widening or shrinking the width or heights of rows
and columns.
Editing data in a cell
To edit data in a single cell, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the cell that contains the data you want to edit.
Excel displays a cursor in your selected cell.
2. Edit your data by using the Backspace or Delete key, or by typing
new data.
If you click a cell, Excel displays the contents of that cell in the Formula bar.
You can click and edit data directly in the Formula bar, which can be more
convenient for editing large amounts of data.
Changing the size of rows and 
columns with the mouse
Using the mouse can be a quick way to modify the sizes of rows and columns.
To change the height of a row or the width of a column, follow these steps:
144
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

1. Move the mouse pointer over the bottom line of a row heading, such
as the 2 or 18 heading. (Or move the mouse pointer over the right line
of the column heading, such as A or D.)
The mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
Excel resizes your row or column.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your
row or column.
Typing the size of rows and columns
If you need to resize a row or column to a precise value, it’s easier to type a
specific value into the Row Height or Column Width dialog box instead. To type
a value into a Row Height or Column Width dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the row or column heading that you want to resize.
Excel highlights your entire row or column.
3. Click the Format icon that appears in the Cells group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Click Height (if you selected a row) or Width (if you selected a
column).
The Row Height or Column Width dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 7-17.
5. Type a value and then click OK.
Excel resizes your row or column.
Excel measures column width in characters. (A cell defined as 1 character
width can display a single letter or number.) Excel measures row height by
points where 1 point equals 1⁄72 inch.
Figure 7-17:
Enter a
width for
the column.
145
Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

Adding and deleting rows and columns
After you type in labels, numbers, and formulas, you may suddenly realize
that you need to add or delete extra rows or columns. To add a row or
column, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the row or column heading where you want to add another row
or column.
3. Click the Insert icon in the Cells group.
Inserting a row adds a new row above the selected row. Inserting a
column adds a new column to the left of the selected column.
To delete a row or column, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the row or column heading that you want to delete.
3. Click the Delete icon in the Cells group.
Deleting a row or column deletes any data stored in that row or column.
Adding sheets
For greater flexibility, Excel lets you create individual spreadsheets that you
can save in a single workbook (file). When you load Excel, it automatically
provides you with three sheets, but you can add more if you need them.
To add a new sheet, choose one of the following:
 Click the Insert Worksheet icon.
 Click the Home tab, click the downward-pointing arrow next to the
Insert icon in the Cells group, and then choose Insert Sheet, as shown
in Figure 7-18.
Renaming sheets
By default, Excel gives each sheet a generic name such as Sheet1. To give
your sheets a more descriptive name, follow these steps:
146
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

1. Choose one of the following:
• Double-click the sheet tab that you want to rename.
Excel highlights the entire sheet name.

Rearranging sheets
You can rearrange the order that your sheets appear in your workbook. To
rearrange a sheet, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer over the sheet tab that you want to move.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
The downward-pointing black arrow points where Excel will place your
sheet.
3. Release the left mouse button to place your sheet in a new order.
Deleting a sheet
Using multiple sheets may be handy, but you may want to delete a sheet if
you don’t need it.
If you delete a sheet, you also delete all the data stored on that sheet.
To delete a sheet, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following:
• Right-click the tab of the sheet you want to delete. When a pop-up
menu appears, click Delete.
• Click the Home tab, click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to
the right of the Delete icon in the Cells group, and choose Delete Sheet.
If your sheet is empty, Excel deletes the sheet right away. If your sheet
contains data, a dialog box appears to warn you that you’ll lose any data
stored on that sheet.
2. Click Delete.
Excel deletes your sheet along with any data on it.
Clearing Data
After you create a spreadsheet, you may need to delete data, formulas, or just
the formatting that defines the appearance of your data. To clear out one or
more cells of data, formatting, or both data and formatting, follow these steps:
148
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

1. Click the Home tab.
2. Select the cell or cells that contain the data you want to clear.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Clear icon in
the Editing group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-19.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Clear All: Deletes the data and any formatting applied to that cell
or cells
• Clear Formats: Leaves the data in the cell but strips away any 
formatting
• Clear Contents: Leaves the formatting in the cell but deletes the data
• Clear Comments: Leaves data and formatting but deletes any com-
ments added to the cell
Printing Workbooks
After you create a spreadsheet, you can print it out for others to see. When
printing spreadsheets, you need to take special care how your spreadsheet
appears on a page because a large spreadsheet will likely get printed on two
or more sheets of paper.
This can cause problems if an entire spreadsheet prints on a one page but a
single row of numbers appears on a second page, which can make reading
and understanding your spreadsheet data confusing. When printing spread-
sheets, take time to align your data so that it prints correctly on every page.
Figure 7-19:
The Clear
menu
provides dif-
ferent ways
to clear

Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

Using Page Layout view
Excel can display your spreadsheets in two ways: Normal view and Page
Layout view. Normal view is the default appearance, which simply fills your
screen with rows and columns so you can see as much of your spreadsheet
as possible.
Page Layout view displays your spreadsheet exactly as it will appear if you
print it. Not only can you see where your page breaks occur, but you can also
add any headers to the top of your spreadsheet as well.
To switch back and forth from Normal view to Page Layout view, follow these
steps:
1. Click the View tab.
2. Click the Normal or Page Layout View icon in the Workbook Views
group, as shown in Figure 7-20.
You can also click the Normal or Page Layout View icons in the bottom-right

Adding a header (or footer)
Headers and footers are useful when printing out your spreadsheet. A header
may explain the information in the spreadsheet, such as 2007 Tax Return
Information, and a footer may display page numbers. To create a header or
footer, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Header & Footer icon in the Text group.
Excel displays the Design contextual tools tab and creates a text box for
your header and footer, as shown in Figure 7-21.
3. Type your header text in the header text box.
4. Click the Go To Footer icon in the Navigation group.
Excel displays your footer text box.
5. Type your footer text in the footer text box.

Printing gridlines
Gridlines help you understand how your numbers, labels, and formulas are
aligned with one another. If you need to print a large spreadsheet, you may
want to print gridlines to make it easier to understand.
To print gridlines and/or row and column headings, follow these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. (Optional) Select the Print check box under the Gridlines category.
3. (Optional) Select the Print check box under the Heading category.
Defining a print area
Sometimes you may not want to print your entire spreadsheet but just a cer-
tain part of it, called the print area. To define the print area, follow these
steps:
1. Select the cells that you want to print.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. Click the Print Area icon in the Page Setup group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-22.
4. Choose Set Print Area.
Excel displays a dotted line around your print area.
5. Click the Office Button and then click the right-pointing arrow that
appears to the right of Print.
A print menu appears.
6. Choose Quick Print (to print) or Print Preview (to see what your
spreadsheet will look like before you print it).
Figure 7-22:
The Print

152
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

After you define a print area, you can see which cells are part of your print
area by clicking the downward-pointing arrow of the Name box and choosing
Print_Area.
After you define a print area, you can always add to it by following these
steps:
1. Select the cells adjacent to the print area.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. Click the Print Area icon in the Page Setup group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Choose Add to Print Area.
Excel displays a dotted line around your newly defined print area.
After you define the print area, you can always remove it by following these
steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. Click Print Area.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 7-22).
3. Choose Clear Print Area.
Inserting (and removing) page breaks
One problem with large spreadsheets is that when you print them out, parts
may get cut off when printed on separate pages. To correct this problem, you
can tell Excel exactly where page breaks should occur.
To insert page breaks, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor in the cell to define where the vertical and horizontal
page breaks will appear.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. Click the Breaks icon in the Page Setup group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-23.
4. Choose Insert Page Break.
Excel inserts a horizontal page directly above the cell you selected in
Step 1 and a vertical page break to the left of that cell, too.
153
Chapter 7: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas

To remove a page break, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following:
• To remove a horizontal page break: Click in any cell that appears
directly below that horizontal page break.
• To remove a vertical page break: Click in any cell that appears
directly to the right of that horizontal page break.
• To remove both a vertical and horizontal page break: Click in the
cell that appears to the right of the vertical page break and directly
underneath the horizontal page break.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. Click the Breaks icon in the Page Setup group.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 7-23).
4. Choose Remove Page Break.
Excel removes your chosen page break.
Figure 7-23:
The Breaks
menu lets
you insert a
page break.
154
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Printing row and column headings
If you have a large spreadsheet that fills two or more pages, Excel may print
your spreadsheet data on separate pages. Although the first page may print
your labels to identify what each row and column may represent, any addi-
tional pages that Excel prints won’t bear those same identifying labels. As a
result, you may wind up printing rows and columns of numbers without any
labels that identify what those numbers mean.
To fix this problem, you can define labels to print on every page by following
these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. Click the Print Titles icon in the Page Setup group.
The Page Setup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-24.
3. Click the Collapse/Expand button that appears to the far right of the
Rows to Repeat at Top text box.
The Page Setup dialog box shrinks.
4. Click in the row that contains the labels you want to print at the top of
every page.
5. Click the Collapse/Expand button again.
The Page Setup dialog box reappears.

Defining printing margins
To help you squeeze or expand your spreadsheet to fill a printed page, you
can define different margins for each printed page. To define margins, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. Click the Margins icon in the Page Setup group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-25.
3. Choose a page margin style you want to use.
If you choose Custom Margins in Step 3, you can define your own margins for
a printed page.
Defining paper orientation and size
Paper orientation can be either landscape (the paper width is greater than its
height) or portrait mode (the paper width is less than its height). Paper size
defines the physical dimensions of the page.

When you finish defining how to print your spreadsheet, you can either print
right away or view a Print Preview of your spreadsheet just to make sure
everything’s going to print correctly.
To print a spreadsheet right away, click the Office Button, click the right-
pointing arrow that appears to the right of Print, and then choose Quick Print.
To display the Print Preview before printing, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
2. Click the Preview button.
The Print Preview window appears, as shown in Figure 7-28.
If you click the Show Margins icon, the Print Preview window displays
your page margins as dotted lines, which you can drag to move and
redefine new page margins before printing.

xcel can manipulate your data by using formulas. Formulas can be as
simple as adding two or more numbers together or as complicated as
determining the calculation of a second-order differential equation.
Formulas use data, stored in other cells, to calculate a new result that appears
in another cell. To create even more complicated spreadsheets, you can even
make a formula use data from other formulas so that changes in a single cell
can ripple throughout an entire spreadsheet.
Creating a Formula
Formulas consist of three crucial bits of information:
 An equal sign (=)
 One or more cell references
 The type of calculation to do on the data (addition, subtraction, and so on)
A cell reference is simply the unique row and column heading that identifies a
single cell, such as A4 or D9. The four common calculations that a formula
can use are addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Table 8-1 lists other mathematical operators you can use in a formula.

Bo the Cat
A simple formula uses a single mathematical operator and two cell references
such as:
=A4+C7
This formula consists of three parts:
 The = sign: This identifies your formula. If you type just A4+C7 into a
cell, Excel treats it as ordinary text.
 Two cell references: In this example, A4 and C7.
 The addition (+) mathematical operator.
To type a formula in a cell, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want to store the formula.
You can also select a cell by pressing the arrow keys.
Excel highlights your selected cell.
160
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

2. Type the equal sign (=).
This tells Excel that you are creating a formula.
3. Type your formula that includes one or more cell references that
identify cells that contain data, such as A4 or E8.
For example, if you want to add the numbers stored in cells A4 and E8,
you would type =A4+E8.
4. Press Enter.
Typing cell references can get cumbersome because you have to match the
row and column headings of a cell correctly. As a faster alternative, you can
use the mouse to click any cell that contains data; then Excel types that cell
reference into your formula automatically.
To use the mouse to click cell references when creating a formula, follow
these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want to store the formula. (You can also
select the cell by pressing the arrow keys.)
Excel highlights your selected cell.
2. Type the equal sign (=).
This tells Excel that anything you type after the equal sign is part of your
formula.
3. Type any mathematical operators and click any cells that contain
data, such as A4 or E8.
If you want to create the formula =A4+E8, you would do the following:
a. Type =.
This tells Excel that you’re creating a formula.
b. Click cell A4.
Excel types the A4 cell reference in your formula automatically.
c. Type +.
d. Click cell E8.
Excel types in the E8 cell reference in your formula automatically.
4. Press Enter.
After you finish creating a formula, you can type data into the cell references
used in your formula to calculate a new result.
161
Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

Organizing formulas with parentheses
Formulas can be as simple as a single mathematical operator such as =D3*E4.
However, you can also use multiple mathematical operators, such as
=A4+A5*C7/F4+D9
There are two problems with using multiple mathematical operators. First,
they make a formula harder to read and understand. Second, Excel calculates
mathematical operators from left to right, based on precedence, which
means a formula may calculate results differently than you intended.
Precedence tells Excel which mathematical operators to calculate first, as
listed in Table 8-2. For example, Excel calculates multiplication before it 
calculates addition. If you had a formula like
=A3+A4*B4+B5
Excel first multiplies A4*B4 and then adds this result to A3 and B5.

Comparison
Typing parentheses around cell references and mathematical operators not
only organizes your formulas but also tells Excel specifically how you want to
calculate a formula. In the example =A3+A4*B4+B5, Excel multiplies A4 and
B4 first. If you want Excel to first add A3 and A4, then add B4 and B5, and
finally multiply the two results together, you have to use parentheses, like this:
=(A3+A4)*(B4+B5)
162
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Copying formulas
In many spreadsheets, you may need to create similar formulas that use dif-
ferent data. For example, you may have a spreadsheet that needs to add the
same number of cells in adjacent columns.
You could type nearly identical formulas in multiple cells, but that’s tedious
and error-prone. For a faster way, you can copy a formula and paste it in
another cell; then Excel automatically changes the cell references, as shown
in Figure 8-1.
From Figure 8-1, you can see that cell B9 contains the formula =B3+B4+B5+
B6+B7+B8, which simply adds the numbers stored in the six cells directly
above the cell that contains the formula (B9). If you copy this formula to
another cell, that new formula will also add the six cells directly above it.
Copy and paste this formula to cell C9, and Excel changes the formula to
=C3+C4+C5+C6+C7+C8.
To copy and paste a formula so that each formula changes cell references
automatically, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell that contains the formula you want to copy.
2. Press Ctrl+C (or click the Copy icon under the Home tab).
Excel displays a dotted line around your selected cell.
Figure 8-1:
Rather than
type repeti-
tive formulas
over and
over again,
Excel can
copy a
formula but
automati-
cally change
the cell
references.
163
Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

3. Select the cell (or cells) where you want to paste your formula.
If you select multiple cells, Excel pastes a copy of your formula in each
of those cells.
4. Press Ctrl+V (or click the Paste icon under the Home tab).
Excel pastes your formula and automatically changes the cell references.
5. Press Esc or double-click away from the cell with the dotted line to
make the dotted line go away.
Using Functions
Creating simple formulas is easy, but creating complex formulas is hard. To
make complex formulas easier to create, Excel comes with prebuilt formulas
called functions. Table 8-3 lists some of the many functions available.
Table 8-3
Common Excel Functions
Function 
What It Does
Name
AVERAGE
Calculates the average value of numbers stored in two or more cells
COUNT
Counts how many cells contain a number instead of a label (text)
MAX
Finds the largest number stored in two or more cells
MIN
Finds the smallest number stored in two or more cells
ROUND
Rounds a decimal number to a specific number of digits
SQRT
Calculates the square root of a number
SUM
Adds the values stored in two or more cells
Excel literally provides hundreds of functions that you can use by themselves
or as part of your own formulas. A function typically uses one or more cell
references:
 Single cell references, such as =ROUND(C4,2), which rounds the
number found in cell C4 to two decimal places
 Contiguous (adjacent) cell ranges, such as =SUM(A4:A9), which adds all
the numbers found in cells A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9
 Noncontiguous cell ranges, such as =SUM(A4,B7,C11), which adds all
the numbers found in cells A4, B7, and C11
164
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

To use a function, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want to create a formula using a function.
2. Click the Formulas tab.
3. Click one of the following function icons in the Function Library group:
• Financial: Calculates business-related equations, such as the
amount of interest earned over a specified time period
• Logical: Provides logical operators to manipulate True and False
(also known as Boolean) values
• Text: Searches and manipulates text
• Date & Time: Provides date and time information
• Lookup & Reference: Provides information about cells, such as
their row headings
• Math & Trig: Offers mathematical equations
• More Functions: Provides access to statistical and engineering 
functions
4. Click a function category, such as Financial or Math & Trig.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2:
Clicking a

Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

5. Click a function.
The Function Arguments dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
6. Click the cell references you want to use.
7. Repeat Step 6 as many times as necessary.
8. Click OK.
Excel displays the calculation of your function in the cell you selected in
Step 1.
Using the AutoSum command
One of the most useful and commonly used command is the AutoSum com-
mand. The AutoSum command uses the SUM function to add two or more cell
references without making you type those cell references yourself. The most
common use for the AutoSum function is to add a column or row of numbers.
To add a column or row of numbers with the AutoSum function, follow these
steps:
1. Create a column or row of numbers that you want to add.
2. Click at the bottom of the column or the right of the row.
3. Click the Formulas tab.
4. Click the AutoSum icon in the Function Library group.
Excel automatically creates a SUM function in the cell you chose in Step 2
and highlights all the cells where it will retrieve data to add, as shown in
Figure 8-4. (If you accidentally click the downward-pointing arrow under
the AutoSum icon, a pull-down menu appears. Just choose Sum.)
5. Press Enter.
Excel automatically sums all the cell references.
Figure 8-3:
Specify
which cell
references
contain the
data your
function
needs to
calculate a
result.
166
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

The AutoSum icon also appears on the Home tab in the Editing group.
Using recently used functions
Digging through all the different function library menus can be cumbersome,
so Excel tries to make your life easier by creating a special Recently Used list
that contains (what else?) a list of the functions you’ve used most often. From
this menu, you can just see a list of your favorite functions and ignore the
other hundred functions that you may never need in a million years.
To use the list of recently used functions, follow these steps:
1. Click the cell where you want to store a function.
2. Click the Formulas tab.
3. Click the Recently Used icon in the Function Library group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.
4. Choose a function.

167
Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

The more functions you use, the more your list will vary from what you see in
Figure 8-5.
Editing a Formula
After you create a formula, you can always edit it later. You can edit a formula
in two places:
 In the Formula bar
 In the cell itself
To edit a formula in the Formula bar, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell that contains the formula you want to edit.
Excel displays the formula in the Formula bar.
2. Click in the Formula bar and edit your formula using the Backspace
and Delete keys.
To edit a formula in the cell itself, follow these steps:
1. Double-click in the cell that contains the formula you want to edit.
Excel displays a cursor in the cell you selected.
2. Edit your formula using the Backspace and Delete keys.
Because formulas display their calculations in a cell, it can be hard to tell the
difference between cells that contain numbers and cells that contain formu-
las. To make formulas visible, press Ctrl+` (an accent grave character, which
appears on the same key as the ~ symbol).
Goal Seeking
Usually after you can create a formula, you can type in new data to see how
the formula calculates a new result. However, Excel also offers a feature
known as Goal Seeking. With Goal Seeking, you specify the value you want
a formula to calculate, and then Excel changes the data in the formula’s cell
references to tell you what values you need to achieve that goal.
168
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

For example, suppose you have a formula that calculates how much money
you make every month by selling a product such as cars. Change the number
of cars you sell, and Excel calculates your monthly commission. But if you
use Goal Seeking, you can specify you want to earn $5,000 for your monthly
commission, and Excel will work backward to tell you how many cars you
need to sell. As its name implies, Goal Seeking lets you specify a goal and see
what number, in a specific cell, needs to change to help you reach your goal.
To use Goal Seeking, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell that contains a formula.
2. Click the Data tab.
3. Click the What-If Analysis icon in the Data Tools group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.
4. Click Goal Seek.
The Goal Seek dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-7.
5. Click in the To Value text box and type a number that you want to
appear in the formula stored in the cell that you clicked in Step 1.
6. Click in the By Changing Cell text box and click one cell that contains
data used by the formula you chose in Step 1.
Excel displays your cell reference, such as B5, in the Goal Seek dialog box.

7. Click OK.
The Goal Seek Status dialog box changes the data in the cell you chose
in Step 6, as shown in Figure 8-8.
8. Click OK (to keep the changes) or click Cancel (to display the original
values your spreadsheet had before you chose the Goal Seek command).
Creating Multiple Scenarios
Spreadsheets show you what happened in the past. However, you can also
use a spreadsheet to help predict the future by typing in data that represents
your best guess of what might happen.
When you use a spreadsheet as a prediction tool, you may create a best-case
scenario (where customers flood you with orders) and a worst-case scenario
(where hardly anybody buys anything). You could type in different data to rep-
resent multiple possibilities, but then you’d wipe out your old data. For a quick
way to plug different data in the same spreadsheet, Excel offers scenarios.
A scenario lets you define different data for multiple cells. That way, you can
choose a scenario to plug in one set of data, and then switch back to your
original data without retyping everything.
Creating a scenario
Before you can create a scenario, you must first create a spreadsheet with
data and formulas. Then you can create a scenario to define the data to plug
into one or more cells.
To create a scenario, follow these steps:
1. Click the Data tab.

your scenario, such as Worst-case or Best-case.
6. Click in the Changing Cells text box.
7. Click a cell in your spreadsheet that you want to display different
data. If you want to choose multiple cells, hold down the Ctrl key and
click multiple cells.
8. Click in the Comment text box and type any additional comments
you want to add to your scenario, such as any assumptions your 
scenario made.
9. Click OK.

Viewing a scenario summary
If you have multiple scenarios, it can be hard to switch back and forth between
different scenarios and still understand which numbers are changing. To help
you view the numbers that change in all your scenarios, you can create a sce-
nario summary.
A scenario summary displays your original data along with the data stored in
each scenario in a table. By viewing a scenario summary, you can see how
the values of your spreadsheet can change depending on the scenario, as
shown in Figure 8-13.
To create a scenario summary on a separate sheet in your workbook, follow
these steps:

Auditing Your Formulas
Your spreadsheet results are only as good as the data you give it and the for-
mulas you create. Feed a spreadsheet the wrong data, and it will obviously
calculate the wrong result. More troublesome is when you feed a spreadsheet
the right data but your formula is incorrect, which produces a misleading and
incorrect result.
Even if Excel appears to be calculating your formulas correctly, recheck your
calculations just to make sure. Some common errors that can mess up your
formulas include
 Missing data: The formula isn’t using all the data necessary to calculate
the proper result.
 Incorrect data: The formula is getting data from the wrong cell.
 Incorrect calculation: Your formula is incorrectly calculating a result.
If a formula is calculating data incorrectly, you probably didn’t type the for-
mula correctly. For example, you may want a formula to add two numbers,
but you accidentally typed in the formula to multiply two numbers instead.
To check whether a formula is calculating data incorrectly, give it data that
you already know what the result should be. For example, if you typed the
numbers 4 and 7 into a formula that should add two numbers, but it returns
28 instead, you know it’s not calculating correctly.
If your formula is correct but it’s still not calculating the right result, chances
are good it’s not getting the data it needs from the correct cells. To help you
trace whether a formula is receiving all the data it needs, Excel offers auditing
features that visually show you which cells supply data to which formulas.
By using Excel’s auditing features, you can
 Make sure your formulas are using data from the correct cells.
 Find out instantly whether a formula could go haywire if you change a
cell reference.
Figure 8-14:

Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

Finding where a formula gets its data
If a formula is retrieving data from the wrong cells, it’s never going to calculate
the right result. By tracing a formula, you can see all the cells that a formula
uses to retrieve data.
Any cell that supplies data to a formula is a precedent.
To trace a formula, follow these steps:
1. Click a cell that contains the formula you want to check.
2. Click the Formulas tab.
3. Click the Trace Precedents icon in the Formula Auditing group.
Excel draws arrows that show you all the cells that feed data into the
formula you chose in Step 1, as shown in Figure 8-15.
4. Click the Remove Arrows button to make the auditing arrows go away.
Finding which formula(s) 
a cell can change
Sometimes you may be curious how a particular cell might affect a formula
stored in your worksheet. Although you could just type a new value in that
cell and look for any changes, it’s easier (and more accurate) to identify all
formulas that are dependent on a particular cell.
Any formula that receives data is a dependent.
To find one or more formulas that a single cell might affect, follow these steps:
Figure 8-15:
Excel draws
arrows that
trace prece-
dent cells
that feed
data into a
formula.
176
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

1. Click any cell that contains data (not a formula).
2. Click the Formulas tab.
3. Click Trace Dependents.
Excel draws an arrow that points to a cell that contains a formula, as
shown in Figure 8-16. This tells you that if you change the data in the cell
you chose in Step 1, it will change the calculated result in the cell con-
taining a formula.
4. Click the Remove Arrows icon in the Formula Auditing group to make
the arrows go away.
Data Validation
Because formulas are only as accurate as the data they receive, it’s important
that your spreadsheet contains only valid data. Examples of invalid data
might be a negative number (such as –9) for a price or a decimal number
(such as 4.39) for the number of items a customer bought.
To keep your spreadsheet from accepting invalid data, you can define a cell
to accept only certain types of data, such as numbers that fall between 30
and 100. The moment someone tries to type invalid data into a cell, Excel
immediately warns you, as shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-17:
Excel warns
you if you
type invalid
data in
a cell.
Figure 8-16:

177
Chapter 8: Playing with Formulas

To define valid types of data for a cell, follow these steps:
1. Click a cell that contains data used by a formula.
2. Click the Data tab.
3. Click the Data Validation icon in the Data Tools group.
The Data Validation dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-18.
4. Click the Allow list box and choose one of the following:
• Any Value: The default value accepts anything the user types
• Whole Number: Accepts only whole numbers, such as 47 and 903
• Decimal: Accepts whole and decimal numbers, such as 48.01 or 1.00
• List: Allows you to define a list of valid data
• Date: Accepts only dates
• Time: Accepts only times
• Text length: Defines a minimum and maximum length for text
• Custom: Allows you to define a formula to specify valid data
Depending on the option you choose, you may need to define Minimum
and Maximum values and whether you want the data to be equal to, less
than, or greater than a defined limit.
5. Click the Input Message tab in the Data Validation dialog box, as
shown in Figure 8-19.
6. Click in the Title text box and type a title.

I
f you stare at an Excel spreadsheet long enough, you may ask yourself,
“What do these numbers really mean?” 
To help you analyze and understand what rows and columns of numbers
might mean, Excel offers the ability to convert your data into a variety of
charts such as pie charts, bar charts, and line charts. By letting you visualize
your data, Excel helps you quickly understand what your data means so you
can spot trends and patterns.
Understanding the Parts of a Chart
To create charts that clarify your data (rather than confuse you even more),
you need to understand the parts of a chart and their purpose, as shown in
Figure 9-1:
 Data Series: The numeric data that Excel uses to create the chart
 X-axis: Defines the width of a chart
 Y-axis: Defines the height of a chart
 Legend: Provides text to explain what each visual part of a chart means
 Chart Title: Explains the purpose of the entire chart

Charts typically use two data series to create a chart. For example, one data
series may be sales made that month, while a second data series may be the
names of each salesperson.
The X-axis of such a chart would list the names of each salesperson while the
Y-axis would list a range of numbers that represent dollar amounts. The chart
itself could display different colors that represent different products sold,
and the legend would explain what each color represents (such as red mea-
suring life insurance policies sold, green measuring auto insurance policies
sold, and yellow measuring health insurance policies sold).
By glancing at the column chart in Figure 9-1, you can quickly identify
 Total sales contributed by each salesperson every month
 Which salesperson is selling the most (and which is selling the least)
 Whether a particular salesperson is improving (or getting worse) at 
selling
All this data came from the spreadsheet, also shown in Figure 9-1. Looking at
the numbers in this spreadsheet, trying to identify the above information is
nearly impossible. However, with the aid of a chart, identifying this type of
information is so simple even your boss could do it.

182
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Although Figure 9-1 shows a column chart, Excel can create a variety of other
types of charts so you can look at your data in different ways, as shown in
Figure 9-2. Some of the other types of charts Excel can create include
 Column chart: Displays quantities as vertical columns that “grow”
upward. Useful for creating charts that compare two items, such as
sales per month or sales per salesperson.
 Line chart: Displays quantities as lines. Essentially shows the tops of a
column chart.
 Area chart: Identical to a line chart except that it shades the area under-
neath each line.
 Bar chart: Essentially a column chart turned on its side where bars
“grow” from left to right.
 Pie chart: Compares multiple items in relation to a whole, such as which
product sales make up a percentage of a company’s overall profits.
Excel can create both two and three-dimensional charts. A 3-D chart can look
neat, but sometimes the 3-D visual can obscure the true purpose of the chart,
which is to simplify data and make it easy for you to understand in the first
place.

Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

Creating a Chart
Before you create a chart, you need to type in some numbers and identifying
labels because Excel will use those labels to identify the parts of your chart.
(You can always edit your chart later if you don’t want Excel to display cer-
tain labels or numbers.)
To create a chart, follow these steps:
1. Select the numbers and labels that you want to use to create a chart.
2. Click the Insert tab.
A list of chart type icons appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
3. Click a Chart icon, such as the Pie or Line icon.
The Create Chart gallery appears (see Figure 9-3).
4. Click a chart type.
Excel creates your chart and displays a Chart Tools tab, as shown in
Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-3:
The Insert
tab displays

184
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Editing a Chart
After you create a chart, you may want to edit it. Editing a chart can mean
moving it to a new location, changing the data source (the numbers that
Excel uses to create the chart), modifying parts of the chart itself (such as
switching to a different chart type), or editing text (such as the chart title or
legend).
Moving a chart on a worksheet
When you create a chart, Excel plops it right on your displayed spreadsheet,
which may not be exactly where you want it to appear. Excel gives you the
option of moving a chart to a different place on the current worksheet page
or on a different worksheet page altogether.
Figure 9-4:
The Chart
Tools tab
appears so
you can
modify a
chart after
you create it.
185
Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

To move a chart to a different location on the same worksheet, follow these
steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer over the border of the chart until the mouse
pointer turns into a four-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
The chart moves with the mouse.
3. Move the chart where you want it to appear and release the left
mouse button.
Moving a chart to a new sheet
Rather than move a chart on the same sheet where it appears, you can also
move the chart to another worksheet. That way your data can appear on one
worksheet, and your chart can appear on another.
To move a chart to an entirely different sheet, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to move to another worksheet.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab.
3. Click the Move Chart icon in the Location group.
The Move Chart dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-5.
As an alternative to Steps 1–3, you can right-click a chart; then, when the
pop-up menu appears, choose Move Chart.
Figure 9-5:
Specify a
worksheet
where you
want to
move your
chart.

4. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• New Sheet: Creates a new worksheet and lets you name it
• Object In: Lets you choose the name of an existing worksheet
5. Click OK.
Excel moves your chart.
Resizing a chart
You can always resize any chart to make it bigger or smaller. To resize a
chart, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer over any corner of the chart until the mouse
pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse to shrink
or expand your chart.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of
your chart.
Using the Chart Tools
As soon as you create a chart or click on an existing chart, Excel displays the
Chart Tools tab, which provides tools organized into four categories:
 Type: Lets you change the chart type
 Data: Lets you change the source where the chart retrieves its data or
switch the data from appearing along the X-axis to the Y-axis and vice
versa
 Chart Layouts: Lets you change the individual parts of a chart, such as
the chart title, X- or Y-axis labels, or the placement of the chart legend
(top, bottom, left, right)
 Chart Styles: Provides different ways to change the appearance of
your chart
187
Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

Changing the chart type
After you create a chart, you can experiment with how your data may look
when displayed as a different chart, such as switching your chart from a bar
chart to a pie chart. To change chart types, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to change.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab under the Chart Tools tab.
3. Click the Change Chart Type icon in the Type group.
The Change Chart Type dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-6.
4. Click a chart type, such as Pie or Column.
The dialog box displays a list of chart designs in the right panel of the
dialog box.
5. Click the chart design you want in the right panel.
6. Click OK.
Excel displays your new chart.
If you don’t like how your chart looks, just press Ctrl+Z to return your chart
back to its original design.

188
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Changing the data source
Another way to change the appearance of a chart is to change its data source
(the cells that contain the actual data that the chart uses). To change a
chart’s data source, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to change.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab under the Chart Tools tab.
3. Click the Select Data icon in the Data group.
The Select Data Source dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
4. (Optional) Click the Shrink Dialog Box icon to shrink the Change Data
Source dialog box so you can see more of your spreadsheet.
5. Select all the cells that contain data to create a chart, including any
cells that contain labels, numbers, and formulas.
6. Click OK.
Excel displays your chart using the data you specify in Step 5.
Switching rows and columns
When Excel creates a chart, it displays your data’s labels on the X- and Y-
axes. However, you can switch these around, and Excel can show you how
your chart may change.
Figure 9-7:
Choose new
data to
create a
chart.
189
Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

To switch the rows and columns used to create a chart, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to change.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab under the Chart Tools tab.
3. Click the Switch Row/Column icon in the Data group.
Excel switches the X-axis data to appear on the Y-axis and vice versa.
Changing the parts of a chart
To make your charts more informative, you can add additional text, such as
 A chart title
 A legend
 Data labels
 Axis labels
 Axes
 Gridlines
With each part of a chart, Excel can either hide it completely or move it to a
different location. To modify any part of a chart, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to change.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Layout contextual tools tab under the Chart Tools tab.
3. Click the icon that identifies the part of the chart you want to modify,
such as Chart Title or Axis Titles.
A menu of different options appears, as shown in Figure 9-8.
4. Click an option, such as None.
Excel shows your modified chart.
190
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

Designing the layout of a chart
Although you could add and modify the individual parts of a chart yourself,
such as the location of the chart title or legend, you may find it faster to
choose a predefined layout for your chart. To choose a predefined chart
layout, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to modify.
The Chart Tools tab appears.
2. Click the Design contextual tools tab under the Chart Tools tab.
3. Click the More button in the Chart Layouts group, as shown in
Figure 9-9.
A pull-down menu appears.
Figure 9-8:
The Legend
menu lets
you place it
in different
locations on
your chart.
191
Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

4. Click a chart layout.
Excel changes your chart.
Deleting a chart
Charts may be nice to look at, but eventually you may want to delete them.
To delete a chart, follow these steps:
1. Click the chart you want to delete.
2. Press Delete.
You can also right-click a chart; then, when the pop-up menu appears,
choose Cut.
Organizing Lists in Pivot Tables
Ordinary spreadsheets let you compare two sets of data such as sales
versus time or products sold versus the salesperson who sold them.
Unfortunately, if you want to know how many products each salesperson

sold in a certain month, deciphering this information from a spreadsheet may
not be easy.
That’s where pivot tables come in. A pivot table lets you yank data from your
spreadsheet and organize it in different ways in a table. By rearranging (or
“pivoting”) your data from a row to a column (and vice versa), pivot tables
can help you spot trends that may not be easily identified trapped within the
confines of an ordinary spreadsheet.
Creating a pivot table
Pivot tables use the column headings of a spreadsheet to organize data in a
table. Ideally, each column in the spreadsheet should identify a different type
of data, such as the name of each salesperson, the sales region he or she
works in, and the total amount of sales made, as shown in Figure 9-10.
Figure 9-10:
Before you
create a
pivot table,
you must
create a
spreadsheet
where each
column
identifies a
different set
of data.
193
Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

After you design a spreadsheet with multiple columns of data, follow these
steps to create a pivot table:
1. Select the cells (including column labels) that you want to include in
your pivot table.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the PivotTable icon in the Tables group.
The Create PivotTable dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-11.
4. (Optional) Select the cells that contain the data you want to use in
your pivot table.
You only need to follow Step 4 if you didn’t select any cells in Step 1, or if
you change your mind and want to select different cells than the ones
chosen in Step 1.
5. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• New Worksheet: Puts the pivot table on a new worksheet
• Existing Worksheet: Puts the pivot table on an existing worksheet
6. Click OK.
Excel displays a PivotTable Field List pane, as shown in Figure 9-12.
7. Mark (select) one or more check boxes inside the PivotTable Field List
pane.
Each time you select another check box, Excel modifies how data
appears in your pivot table, as shown in Figure 9-13.

Chapter 9: Charting and Analyzing Data

Rearranging labels in a pivot table
A pivot table organizes data according to your spreadsheet’s column head-
ings (which appear in a pivot table as row labels). The pivot table shown in
Figure 9-13 shows sales divided by salesperson. Each salesperson’s amounts
are further divided by sales region, and the names of the products sold.
However, you may be more interested in seeing the sales organized by sales
region. To do this, you can modify which column heading your pivot table
uses to organize your data first. To rearrange column headings in a pivot
table, follow these steps:
1. Click the pivot table you want to rearrange.
The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow of a label that appears under the
Row Labels group.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 9-14.
Select one of the following:
Figure 9-14:

Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 

• Move Up: Moves the label one level closer to the beginning
• Move Down: Moves the label one level down to the end
• Move to Beginning: Makes the label the dominant criteria for sort-
ing data
• Move to End: Makes the label the last criteria for sorting data
Figure 9-15 shows different ways a pivot table can organize the same data.
Modifying a pivot table
Row labels let you organize data according to different criteria, such as sales
per region and then by product. For greater flexibility, you can also turn a
row label into a column heading. Figure 9-16 shows a pivot table where row
labels are stacked on top of each other, and then the same pivot table where
one row label (Products) is turned into a column heading.
To turn row labels into column headings in a pivot table (or vice versa),
follow these steps:
1. Click the pivot table you want to modify.
The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
2. Click a heading.
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Move to Column Labels (or Row Labels).

Filtering a pivot table
The more information your pivot table contains, the harder it can be to make
sense of any of the data. To help you out, Excel lets you filter your data to
view only certain information, such as sales made by each salesperson or
total sales within a region. To filter a pivot table, follow these steps:
1. Click the pivot table you want to filter.
The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
2. Click a heading in the Row Labels or Column Labels group in the
PivotTable Field List pane.
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Click Move to Report Filter.
Excel moves your chosen label into the Report Filter group in the
PivotTable Field List pane and displays a filter list box at the top of your
pivot table, as shown in Figure 9-17.

Summing a pivot table
A pivot table not only displays information, but it can also count the number
of occurrences of information, such as the number of sales per sales region.
To display a count of data, you need to move a heading in the Values group
inside the PivotTable Field List pane by following these steps:
1. Click the pivot table you want to modify.
The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
2. Click a heading that you want to count in the PivotTable Field List pane.
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Click Move to Values.
Excel moves your chosen heading to the Values group inside the

T
he fear of public speaking is the number one fear of
most people — with the fear of death running a distant
second. Although Microsoft Office 2007 can’t help you
overcome your fear of death, it can help you overcome
your fear of public speaking and giving presentations with
the help of Microsoft PowerPoint. PowerPoint can help
you organize and design a presentation that can keep
others so amused that they won’t even bother looking in
your direction.
When you use PowerPoint to create a presentation, you
won’t need to rely on mere words, pointless hand gestures,
or crudely drawn diagrams scribbled on a white board.
With PowerPoint, you can give flawless presentations 
consisting of text, graphics, and even sound effects that
people will remember.
The next time you need to dazzle an audience (with facts,
rumors, or blatant lies dressed up to look like facts), flip
through this part of the book and see how PowerPoint can
help you create dazzling slide show presentations and
handouts that can clarify, emphasize, or entertainingly
distort topics for your audience until you have a chance
to sneak out of the room.

that only you can see to each slide and turn your entire slide show presenta-
tion into printed handouts so the audience can review your presentation and
take notes next to a printed copy of each slide. The next time you need to
convince or inform an audience, use PowerPoint to create and deliver your
presentation. (Just make sure you never use PowerPoint to propose marriage.)
Defining the Purpose 
of Your Presentation
PowerPoint can make creating and delivering a presentation easy, but before
you start creating fancy visuals with eye-popping graphics and colors, step

away from your computer, put down your copy of PowerPoint, and place
your hands in the open where anyone can see them.
Rushing into PowerPoint to create a presentation is likely to create a dazzling
array of colors, fonts, and graphics that may look interesting but won’t convey
your message effectively. The best way to create an effective presentation is
to take some time to think about the following:
 What is your point? Define the single most important idea of your 
presentation.
 Who is the target audience? A presentation given to engineers and sci-
entists will look different than the same presentation given to CEOs and
venture capital executives.
 What do you want the audience to do? A speaker may present new
ideas to a conference while a politician may present ideas designed to
sway the audience to take certain actions, such as voting a specific way.
After you understand the purpose of your presentation, your audience, and
what you hope your presentation will do, you’re ready to go through the
physical steps of creating a presentation in PowerPoint.
Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
A PowerPoint presentation consists of one or more slides where each slide
can display text and graphics. Creating a presentation means adding slides
and typing text or pasting graphics on each slide.
When you first start PowerPoint, the program loads a blank presentation that
you can modify right away.
If you’ve been working on another presentation in PowerPoint and you need
to start a new, blank presentation from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose New.
A New Presentation dialog box appears.
2. Click Blank Presentation and then click Create.
PowerPoint displays a blank slide with a title and subtitle box, as shown
in Figure 10-1.

After you create a new presentation, you need to fill it with content (text and
graphics). PowerPoint gives you two ways to view, edit, and design your 
presentation:
 Slide view
 Outline view
Both views let you add, delete, rearrange, and edit slides. The main difference
is that Slide view lets you add graphics and modify the visual appearance of a
slide. Outline view displays your entire presentation as an outline where each
slide appears as an outline heading, and additional text on each slide appears
as a subheading. Outline view makes it easy to rearrange and organize the
slides in your presentation without the distraction of the visual appearance
of each slide.
You can create an entire presentation in Slide view without ever using Outline
view at all (or use Outline view without ever using Slide view at all). Outline
view is most useful for creating and organizing a presentation. Slide view is
most useful for viewing the appearance of multiple slides at once.

Chapter 10: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation

Designing a presentation with Slide view
Slide view shows your entire slide show as thumbnails in the left pane and
the currently selected slide in full size view in the right pane, as shown in
Figure 10-2.
Creating a new slide
To create a new slide within Slide view, follow these steps:
1. Click an existing slide in the thumbnail pane.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click New Slide in the Slides group.
PowerPoint inserts your new slide after the slide you selected in Step 1.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Rearranging slides
You can rearrange the order of your slides by following these steps:
1. In the thumbnail pane, click the slide that you want to move to a new
position in your presentation.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse up or
down within the thumbnail pane.
PowerPoint displays a horizontal line between slides to show you where
your slide will appear. If you drag the mouse to the top or bottom of the
thumbnail pane, PowerPoint automatically scrolls up or down the list.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the slide’s new
position.
Hiding and deleting a slide
If you have a slide that you no longer want in your presentation, you can
either hide or delete it. Hiding a slide keeps the slide but doesn’t display that
slide when you give your presentation. You may want to hide a slide in case
you need it later or so you can reference the information on this slide with
the rest of your presentation.
To hide a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide in the thumbnail pane that you want to hide.
2. Click the Slide Show tab.
3. Click Hide Slide in the Set Up group.
PowerPoint dims your chosen slide and highlights the Hide Slide icon.
To unhide a slide, repeat the above steps.
If you’re sure you want to get rid of a slide, you can just delete it. To delete a
slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide in the thumbnail pane that you want to delete.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click Delete in the Slides group.
PowerPoint deletes your chosen slide.
209
Chapter 10: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation

If you press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo icon right away, you can recover a
deleted slide.
Designing a presentation 
with Outline view
Outline view shows the title and subtitle text of each slide in the left pane and
the currently selected slide in full size view in the right pane, as shown in
Figure 10-3.
The biggest advantage of Outline view is that it lets you rearrange and orga-
nize your slides by focusing on their content (title and subtitles). To switch
from Slide view to Outline view, click the Outline tab. To switch from Outline
view to Slide view, click the Slides tab.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Creating a new slide
In Outline view, each outline heading represents a slide title and each sub-
heading represents a slide’s subtitles. To create a new slide in Outline view,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Outline tab to switch to Outline view.
2. Click a slide title in the Outline pane.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Press Home to move the cursor to the front of the outline heading.
This creates a new slide before the currently displayed slide.
• Press End to move the cursor to the end of the outline heading.
This creates a new slide after the currently displayed slide.
4. Press Enter.
PowerPoint adds a new, blank slide to your presentation.
Creating subtitles on a slide
Outline view lets you create slides and add subtitles to each slide as well.
To add a subtitle to a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the Outline view tab to display the Outline pane.
2. Click a slide title and then press End to move the cursor to the end of
the slide title.
3. Press Enter.
PowerPoint creates a blank slide title underneath.
4. Press Tab.
PowerPoint indents your slide title and turns it into subtitle text under
the previous outline heading.
Collapsing and expanding subtitles
A large presentation consisting of multiple slides with subtitles can be hard
to read. To simplify the appearance of your outline, PowerPoint lets you col-
lapse or expand outline headings. To collapse or expand an outline heading,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Outline tab to display the Outline pane.
2. Double-click the slide icon of a slide title in the Outline pane.
211
Chapter 10: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation

PowerPoint collapses any subtitles that appear under your chosen out-
line heading and displays a gray line under your outline heading to
let you know that its subtitle text is collapsed (hidden), as shown in
Figure 10-4.
To expand a collapsed slide title, just double-click its slide icon.
Rearranging slides
Outline view makes it easy to rearrange slides just by moving slide titles up
or down. To move a slide title, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer over the slide icon that appears to the left of
the slide title that you want to move.
The mouse turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse up
or down.
PowerPoint displays a horizontal gray line to show where the new posi-
tion of the slide will appear in your presentation.
3. Release the left mouse button.
PowerPoint moves your outline heading to its new position in your 
presentation.
Deleting a slide
To delete a slide in Outline view, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide icon that appears to the left of the slide title you want
to delete.
2. Press Delete.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Working with Text
Most slides contain exactly one title and one subtitle text box. The title text
box typically defines the information that the slide presents, while the subti-
tle text box displays supporting information.
When you create a new slide, both the title and subtitle text boxes will be
empty, although they’ll both display the message Click here to add
title or Click here to add subtitle. (This text won’t appear on your
slides if you don’t type anything there.)
If you delete all the text inside of a title or subtitle text box, PowerPoint 
automatically displays the Click here to add title or Click here
to add subtitle text in the empty text boxes.
To add text inside a title or subtitle text box, follow these steps:
1. Click in the title or subtitle text box, directly on the slide.
PowerPoint displays a cursor in your chosen text box.
2. Type your text.
You can also create title and subtitle text in Outline view as explained in the
earlier section, “Designing a presentation with Outline view.”
Typing text in a text box
A typical PowerPoint slide lets you type text in the Title text box or the
Subtitle text box. When you type text in the Title or Subtitle text box, the 
contents appear as slide titles and subheadings within Outline view.
However, PowerPoint also offers you a third option for displaying text on a
slide: You can create your own text box and place it anywhere on the slide.
When you create your own text box and fill it with text, this text will not
appear within Outline view.
To create and place a text box on a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. Click the Text Box icon in the Text group.
The mouse pointer turns into a downward-pointing arrow.
213
Chapter 10: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation

3. Move the mouse pointer over the area on the slide where you want to
create a text box.
4. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse to draw
a text box on a slide.
5. Release the left mouse button.
PowerPoint displays a text box, as shown in Figure 10-5.
6. Type your text inside the text box.
Any text you type into a text box that you create will not appear in
Outline view.
Formatting text
After you create text in a text box, you can format it by choosing different
fonts, font sizes, and colors. To change the appearance of text, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click in a text box and select the text you want to format.
3. Click one of the following font tools, as shown in Figure 10-6:

to a Presentation
In This Chapter
 Using themes
 Changing a background

 Adding sound to a presentation
T
o make your presentations look more visually appealing, PowerPoint lets
you add color and graphics to your slides. Color and graphics can’t turn
a worthless presentation into an informative one, but they can enhance an
informative presentation and make it easier for people to watch.
Applying a Theme
By default, PowerPoint displays each slide with a white background.
Although you could change the colors and appearance of each slide indi-
vidually, it’s much easier to change every slide in your presentation using a
theme. A theme provides predesigned colors and designs that are applied to
each slide to give your presentation a uniform and professional look.
To define a theme for a presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click the Design tab.
2. Click the More button under the Themes group.
A menu appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.

If you move the mouse pointer over a theme, PowerPoint shows how
your presentation will look.
3. Click a theme.
PowerPoint displays your chosen theme on your slides.
4. Click the Theme Colors icon in the Themes group.
A menu appears, listing different color variations you can choose for
your presentation, as shown in Figure 11-2.
5. Click a color pattern.
PowerPoint displays your new theme colors.
6. Click the Fonts icon in the Themes group.
A menu appears listing all the default fonts for your presentation, as
shown in Figure 11-3.
7. Click a font.
8. Click the Effects icon in the Themes group.
A menu appears listing all the different effects you can give your presen-
tation, such as Metro or Currency.

Chapter 11: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation

Changing the Background
Another way to change the appearance of your presentation is to modify the
background of your slides. PowerPoint provides predefined background
themes that you can choose. To choose a background theme, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Design tab.
2. Click Background Styles under the Background group.
A menu displays different backgrounds you can choose, as shown in
Figure 11-4.
3. Click a background style.
PowerPoint applies your chosen background style to every slide in your
presentation.
Choosing a solid color background
Rather than choose a theme, you might want to choose a solid color. If you
choose a solid color background, you must make sure that any text or graph-
ics that appear on your slides can still be seen. For example, if you choose a
dark red background, any text or graphics on your slides should appear in
light colors to make them visible against the dark red background.
To make sure solid background colors don’t obscure your text and graphics,
you can also adjust its transparency to make the color appear darker or
lighter.
Figure 11-4:
The
Background
Styles menu
lists different
background
designs for

in your presentation.
If you don’t click the Apply to All button, PowerPoint changes only the
background of the currently selected slide.
9. Click Close.
Choosing a gradient background
A gradient displays one color that gradually fades into another color, such as
green to orange. To define a gradient, you can define one or more stops,
transparency, and the gradient direction. Stops define where the colors in the
gradient start and end. Transparency defines how opaque a color appears.
The gradient direction defines how the gradient appears, such as vertically or
diagonally.
To define a gradient background, follow these steps:
1. Click the Design tab.
2. Click the Background Styles icon in the Background group.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 11-4).

apply to every slide in your presentation.
If you don’t click the Apply to All button, PowerPoint displays only the
background of the currently selected slide.
14. Click Close.
Choosing a picture background
A picture, such as clip art or a photograph captured with a digital camera,
can appear in your background. After you use a picture for the background,
you can also adjust its transparency so that you can read any title or subtitle
text that appears on each slide.

Adding Graphics to a Slide
Another way to spice up the appearance of your presentation is to include
graphics on one or more slides. Such graphics can be informative, such as a
chart that displays sales results; or they can be decorative, such as a cartoon
smiley face that emphasizes the presentation’s good news.
Three common types of graphics you can add to a PowerPoint slide include
 Picture files: Includes clip art images as well as images you may have
stored on your hard disk, such as photographs from your digital camera
 Charts: Displays bar, column, line, pie, and other types of charts
 WordArt: Displays text as colorful text

1. Move the mouse pointer over the edge of the graphic image you want
to move.
The mouse turns into a four-way pointing arrow.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
PowerPoint moves your graphic image.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new posi-
tion of your graphic image.
After you add a graphic image to a slide, you may later decide to delete it. To
delete a graphic image, follow these steps:
1. Click the graphic image you want to delete.
PowerPoint displays handles around your chosen graphic image.
2. Press Delete.
PowerPoint deletes your chosen graphic image.
Rotating graphics
You may want to rotate graphic images for added visual effects. To rotate
images or to flip them vertically or horizontally, follow these steps:
1. Click the graphic image you want to rotate.
PowerPoint displays handles around your image along with a green
rotate handle.
2. Move the mouse pointer over the rotate handle.
The mouse pointer turns into a circular arrow.
3. Hold down the left mouse button and move (drag) the mouse.
PowerPoint rotates your graphic image.
If you hold down the Shift key while dragging the mouse, you can rotate
an image at 15 degree increments.

Chapter 11: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation

Layering objects
PowerPoint treats graphics and text boxes (see Chapter 10) as objects that
you can move around on a slide. If you move one object over another, it may
block part of another object, as shown in Figure 11-12.
When one object covers another one, PowerPoint considers the first object to
be on top and the other object (the one being obscured) to be on the bottom.
By moving objects from top to bottom (or vice versa), you can create unique
visual effects (or just cover up parts of other objects by mistake).
To move a graphic image to the top or bottom when layered over another
object, follow these steps:
1. Click the graphic image you want to move.
The Format contextual tab appears.
2. Click the Bring to Front or Send to Back icon in the Arrange group.
PowerPoint rearranges the layering of your graphic images.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Adding Movies to a Slide
Besides adding static graphic images, you can also add movies to a slide so
that they play as part of your presentation. You can add two types of movies:
simple graphic animations (animated GIF files) included with PowerPoint or
movie files that you can download off the Internet or capture with a digital
video camera.
Adding an animated cartoon to a slide
PowerPoint includes a library of simple animated cartoons that you can
place on a slide for added visual emphasis. To include one of these animated
cartoons on a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to
add an animated cartoon.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the Movie icon in the
Media Clips group.
A pull-down menu appears, enabling you to choose whether to select a
movie from a file stored on your hard disk, or to select a movie from
PowerPoint’s clip organizer.
4. Choose Movie from Clip Organizer.
A Clip Art window appears on the right side of the screen, as shown in
Figure 11-13.
5. Click a cartoon.
PowerPoint displays your cartoon on the slide. (You may need to move
or resize it.)
You won’t see the animated cartoon in action until you view your presenta-
tion by pressing F5.
Adding a movie to a slide
PowerPoint slides can also display a movie. When you store a movie on a
slide, you can resize its size and move it anywhere on your slide. As soon as
your slide appears, you have the option of having the movie play automati-
cally or wait until you click the mouse first.
235
Chapter 11: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation

PowerPoint can use movies stored in common Windows video formats such
as AVI, MPEG, ASF (streaming video), and WMV files. If your movie is stored
in a different file format, such as QuickTime, you have to convert the file first
before you can add it to a PowerPoint presentation.
To add a movie to a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to
add a movie.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Movie icon in the Media Clips group.
The Insert Movie dialog box appears.
If you click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the Movie icon, a
pull-down menu appears. Choose Movie from File.
4. Click the movie file you want to add and then click OK.
PowerPoint displays a box on your slide where your movie will appear
along with a dialog box, asking whether you want the movie to play auto-
matically or when you click the mouse, as shown in Figure 11-14.
5. Click Automatically or When Clicked.
6. Move the mouse pointer over the movie.
Figure 11-13:

The mouse pointer turns into a four-way pointing arrow.
7. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse to place
the movie where you want it to appear on the slide.
8. Move the mouse pointer over one corner of the movie until the mouse
pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
9. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse to resize
the movie.
You won’t see your movie play until you view your presentation by pressing F5.
Adding Sound to a Slide
Sound can be as simple as a sound effect (like a gun firing to wake up people in
the middle of your presentation) or a recorded speech from the CEO, explain-
ing why everyone’s going to be forced to take a 25 percent pay cut while the
CEO gets a golden parachute of $500,000 a year for the rest of his life.
The three types of sound files you can include in a presentation include audio
files stored on your computer, sound files included with PowerPoint, and
audio tracks from an audio CD in your computer.
Figure 11-14:

237
Chapter 11: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation

PowerPoint can use audio files stored in common formats such as AIFF, MIDI,
MP3, and WAV files. If your audio file is stored in a different file format, such
as Real Audio, you’ll have to convert the file first before you can add it to a
PowerPoint presentation.
Adding an audio file to a presentation
If you already have music, sound effects, or a speech stored as a file, such as
an MP3 file, you can add it to your presentation. To add an audio file to a
slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to
add an audio file.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the Sound icon in the
Media Clips group.
A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 11-15.
4. Choose Sound from File.
The Insert Sound dialog box appears.
5. Click the audio file you want to add and then click OK.

sented as a horn icon) and displays a dialog box, asking whether you
want the sound to play automatically or when you click the mouse.
6. Click Automatically or When Clicked.
PowerPoint displays your audio file as a sound icon on your slide. You may
want to move the sound icon on your slide so it doesn’t obscure part of
your slide.
You won’t hear your sound file play until you view your slide show by press-
ing F5.

In This Chapter
 Spell-checking a presentation
 Adding visual transitions
 Adding hyperlinks on a slide
 Viewing a presentation
 Printing handouts
 Packing a presentation on a CD
T
he whole point of creating a PowerPoint presentation is to show it off to
an audience. So PowerPoint provides some handy Hollywood-style special
effects to make your presentation look more interesting to your eyes and ears.
PowerPoint also provides features for creating handouts for your audience.
Because people often want to take notes during an interesting presentation
(or just doodle during a really boring presentation), PowerPoint can create
handouts that you can print and distribute.
Spell-Checking Your Presentation
You could have the best presentation in the world, but it will look like the
worst presentation in the world if you have misspellings and typos on your
slides for everyone to snicker at. To prevent this problem from occurring,
PowerPoint can spell-check your entire presentation.
PowerPoint automatically underlines all misspelled words with a red squiggly
line. If you right-click any word underlined with a red squiggly line, a pop-up
menu appears with a list of correctly spelled alternatives that you can choose.
To spell-check your entire presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click the Review tab.

2. Click the Spelling icon.
PowerPoint displays the Spelling dialog box when it finds a misspelled
word, as shown in Figure 12-1.
3. Choose one of the following for each word that PowerPoint highlights
as misspelled:
• Change: Click the correct spelling of the word and then click
Change. (Click Change All to change all identical misspellings
throughout your presentation.)
• Ignore All: Click Ignore All to ignore all instances of that word
throughout your presentation.
• Add: Click Add to add the word to the PowerPoint dictionary so it
won’t flag the word as misspelled again.
4. Click Close to stop spell-checking.
PowerPoint won’t recognize technical terms, proper names, or correctly
spelled words used incorrectly, such as using the word there instead of their,
so it’s a good idea to proofread your presentation yourself.
Adding Visual Transitions
Transitions define how slides or part of a slide (text or graphics) appear
during your presentation. By default, slides appear one at a time with all
the text and graphics displayed at once, which can get monotonous.
Figure 12-1:
The Spelling
dialog box
can identify
potential
misspellings
and offer
corrections.
242
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

To spice up your presentation, PowerPoint offers two types of transitions:
 Slide transitions
 Text and picture transitions
Use transitions sparingly. Transitions may be visually interesting, but you
don’t want your transitions to be distracting.
Adding slide transitions
Slide transitions can make a slide appear to melt or break into multiple
pieces that slip away, revealing the next slide underneath.
When creating a transition, you need to define the following:
 The actual visual appearance of the transition
 The speed of the transition (Slow, Medium, or Fast)
 Any sound effects you want to play during the transition (these can get
really annoying, so use them sparingly)
 When to display the transition (after a certain time period or when you
click the mouse)
To create a slide transition, follow these steps:
1. Click a slide (in the Slide or Outline view pane).
Any transition you choose will end by displaying the slide you choose in
this step.
2. Click the Animations tab.
PowerPoint displays the different animation (transition) tools, as shown
in Figure 12-2.
More button

Chapter 12: Showing Off a Presentation

3. Click the More button of the Transition To This Slide group.
A pull-down menu appears listing all the different transitions available,
as shown in Figure 12-3.
If you move the mouse over a transition, PowerPoint shows you what
that transition will look like on your chosen slide.
4. Click the transition you want.
5. (Optional) Click in the Transition Sound list box and choose a sound,
such as Cash Register or Drum Roll.
6. (Optional) Click in the Transition Speed list box and choose a speed
(Slow, Medium, or Fast).
7. (Optional) Select the Automatically After or the On Mouse Click
check box.
If you select the Automatically After check box, you have to specify a
time in the Automatically After text box for the slide to wait before run-
ning the transition.
You can select both the On Mouse Click and Automatically After check
boxes, so the slide transition waits until you click the mouse or until a
certain amount of time passes.
8. (Optional) Click Apply to All to apply your transitions to every slide in
your presentation.
Figure 12-3:
The
Transition
menu dis-
plays each
transition as
an icon,
which gives
you an idea
how the
transition
will appear.
244
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Applying the same transition throughout your presentation can give your
slide show a consistent look, but it’s best for only simple, visual transitions
and not for transitions that involve noisy sound effects that get tedious after
a while.
Text transitions
Besides animating how your slides appear and disappear, you can also add
transitions to your text boxes or graphics so they fly or drop into place
across a slide.
Use text transitions sparingly because the transitions can get distracting
when people just want to read your presentation without having to watch 
letters zoom around the screen.
To create a simple text transition, follow these steps:
1. Click a text box or picture on a slide.
PowerPoint displays handles around your chosen item.
2. Click the Animations tab.
3. Click the Animate list box in the Animations group.
A list of different animation schemes appears, as shown in Figure 12-4.
4. Click an animation, such as Fly In or Wipe.
PowerPoint animates your text so you can see how it looks.

Chapter 12: Showing Off a Presentation

Adding Hyperlinks
For greater flexibility in presenting information, PowerPoint lets you add
hyperlinks to your slides. Hyperlinks let you open a Web page (provided you
have an Internet connection), a file (such as a Word document), another slide
in your current presentation, or a program. By adding hyperlinks to your
slides, you can display additional information or display slides out of order.
Creating Web page hyperlinks
A Web page hyperlink lets you convert text into a hyperlink that can load
your default browser and display any Web site. When you exit the browser
(or just switch back to PowerPoint), you can see your slide again and con-
tinue with your presentation.
By accessing a Web site, you can avoid copying data and pasting it on a slide.
For example, if you’re giving a presentation about advertising, you can create
Web page hyperlinks to show how your competitors use the Internet to
advertise and sell their products.
To create a Web page hyperlink, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text in a title or subtitle text box that you want to turn
into a Web page hyperlink.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Links group.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5:
The Insert
Hyperlink
dialog box
lets you type
in a Web site
address.
246
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

4. Click in the Address text box and type a Web site address, such as
www.microsoft.com.
5. Click OK.
PowerPoint underlines the text you selected in Step 1. When you view
your presentation, PowerPoint turns the mouse pointer into a hand icon
when you move the mouse over the hyperlink.
Creating hyperlinks to external files
You may have data stored in another file that you want to include in your
PowerPoint presentation. Rather than copy the data and paste it in your pre-
sentation, it may be easier just to display the file itself. That way you can
update the file, and PowerPoint will always link to the updated file.
When you create a hyperlink to a file, PowerPoint opens that file by loading the
program that created it. For example, if you want to view a Microsoft Word
file, make sure you have a copy of Microsoft Word installed on your computer.
To create a hyperlink that opens an external file, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text in a title or subtitle text box that you want to turn
into an external file hyperlink.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Links group.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears (refer to Figure 12-5).
4. Click in the Look In list box and choose a drive and folder that holds
the file you want to use.
You may need to click through several folders to find the file you want.
5. Click the file you want to use and then click OK.
If you’re viewing your presentation on Windows Vista, a dialog box appears,
warning you that opening a file may be unsafe. This is to protect you from
opening up a file that may contain a virus or Trojan Horse.
Creating hyperlinks to different slides
You can also create hyperlinks that let you jump to a different slide in your
presentation. That way you could jump from slide 2 to slide 35 and then back
to slide 2 again. By doing this, you can create a slide that refers to previous
information or gives viewers a peek at upcoming information.
247
Chapter 12: Showing Off a Presentation

To create a hyperlink that links to other slides in your presentation, follow
these steps:
1. Highlight the text in a text box that you want to turn into a slide
hyperlink.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Action icon in the Links group.
The Action Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
4. Select the Hyperlink To radio button.
5. Click the Hyperlink To list box and choose an option, such as Next
Slide.
If you choose Slide, the Hyperlink to Slide dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 12-7.
The Hyperlink To list box displays commands for linking to the first or
last slide of your presentation. The Slide command is useful for linking
to a slide in the middle of your presentation.
Figure 12-7:
Link to a
specific
slide, such
as slide 3.
Figure 12-6:
The Action
Settings
dialog box
lets you
choose a
slide to
attach to
your
hyperlink.
248
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

6. Click a slide number, such as slide 3, and click OK.
The Action Settings dialog box appears again.
7. Click OK.
When you link to another slide, it’s usually a good idea to create a second
hyperlink that lets you jump back to the previous slide. Otherwise, you can
jump from slide 3 to slide 60 and not be able to return back to slide 3 again to
see the rest of your presentation.
Running a program through a hyperlink
A PowerPoint hyperlink can also run any program from within a presentation.
For example, you could create a presentation that explains how to market a
new computer program, and then create a hyperlink to that same program so
you can demonstrate how that program actually works. When you exit that
program, you’ll return back to your PowerPoint presentation again.
Make sure your computer has enough memory to run both PowerPoint and
any program you want to run.
To create a hyperlink that runs a program, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text in a text box that you want to turn into a program
hyperlink.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Action icon in the Links group.
The Action Settings dialog box appears (refer to Figure 12-6).
4. Select the Run Program radio button.
5. Click Browse.
The Select a Program to Run dialog box appears.
6. Click in the Look In list box to choose the drive that contains the pro-
gram you want to run.
7. Click in the folder and then click Open to find the program you want
to run.
You may have to repeat this step multiple times.
8. Click the program you want to run and then click OK.
The Action Settings dialog box appears again.
9. Click OK.

Viewing a Presentation
After you finish arranging your slides, adding transitions, and adding hyper-
links, you’re ready to test how your entire presentation looks. To view your
entire presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the From Beginning icon in the Start Slide Show group, as
shown in Figure 12-8.
PowerPoint displays the first slide of your presentation.
You can also choose the From Beginning command by pressing F5.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view the next slide.
• Press Esc to exit your presentation.
If you have a large presentation consisting of 300 slides, you may not want to
view the first 290 slides just to test how your last 10 slides look. To avoid this
problem, PowerPoint lets you choose to view your presentation starting with
any slide.
To view your presentation starting with a slide other than the first one, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the From Current Slide icon in the Start Slide Show group (refer
to Figure 12-8).
PowerPoint displays the currently displayed slide.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view the next slide.
• Press Esc to exit your presentation.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Creating a custom slide show
You may have a presentation organized for one audience (engineers and 
scientists) but need to give the same presentation to a different audience
(sales executives). Although you could copy your original presentation and
then modify it, now you’ll be stuck with two copies of the same information.
And, if you modify the information in one presentation, you have to modify
the same information in the second (or third or fourth) presentation.
To avoid this problem, PowerPoint lets you create custom slide shows based
on an existing presentation. Such a custom slide show can selectively show
slides in a different order. To create a custom slide show, you need to define
the order you want to display the slides.
To arrange the order of a custom slide show, follow these steps:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Custom Slide Show icon in the Start Slide Show group.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Choose Custom Shows.
The Custom Shows dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-9.
4. Click New.
The Define Custom Show dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-10.
5. Click in the Slide Show Name text box and type a name for your
custom slide show.
6. Click a slide in the Slides in Presentation list box and then click the
Add button.
This tells PowerPoint which existing slides you want to reuse in your
custom slide show.
Figure 12-9:

PowerPoint shows your new, customized presentation.
To present a custom slide show, follow these steps:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Custom Slide Show icon in the Start Slide Show group.
A pull-down menu appears that lists the names of all the custom slide
shows you’ve created.
3. Click the name of the custom slide show you want to view.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view the next slide.
• Press Esc to exit your presentation.
Hiding a slide
PowerPoint can hide a slide, which lets you keep your slide but not display it
during a presentation. Hiding a slide can be especially handy when you need
Figure 12-10:
Customize
your slide
show by
reordering
slides.
252
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

to create a custom slide show and need a slide to appear only in the custom
slide show but not the original presentation (or vice versa).
To hide a slide, follow these steps:
1. Click the slide that you want to hide (in Slide or Outline view).
2. Click the Slide Show tab.
3. Click the Hide Slide icon in the Set Up group.
PowerPoint dims your selected slide.
To unhide a slide, just repeat the above three steps.
Organizing with Slide Sorter view

6. Click the Normal icon in the Presentation Views group to switch out of
Slide Sorter view.
Timing yourself
To help you practice giving a presentation, PowerPoint can time how long
you’ve spent on each slide. Such timing can give you a rough idea of how
long you want to keep each slide visible for an audience to see.
No matter how hard you may practice, the timing of your presentation by
yourself will almost never be exactly the timings of your actual presentation
because people may ask questions, equipment may fail, distractions may
occur when the waiter drops a plate, and so on.
To time a presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Rehearse Timings icon in the Set Up group.
PowerPoint displays the first slide of your presentation along with the
Timing toolbar that shows you how long your current slide has been vis-
ible, as shown in Figure 12-12.
3. Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view each slide in your 
presentation.

Creating Handouts
When people view a particularly interesting presentation, they often want
copies of that presentation so they can review the information later or have
a place to jot down notes during the presentation itself. For that reason,
PowerPoint lets you create handouts from your presentation.
Handouts typically contain a thumbnail of each slide along with blank space for
jotting down notes about the information presented by that slide. To create a
handout, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and choose Print➪Print Preview.
The Print Preview window appears.
2. Click the Print What list box in the Page Setup group and choose a
handout style, such as Handouts (3 Slides Per Page).
The Print Preview window shows you what your handouts will look like,
as shown in Figure 12-14.
3. Click the Print icon when you’re ready to print your handouts.

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 

Packing Presentations to Go
Many people use their laptops to display their PowerPoint presentations, but
occasionally, you may need to use a different computer to run your presenta-
tion. Because that other computer may not have a copy of PowerPoint, you
can store your entire PowerPoint presentation on a CD that you can run on
another computer.
You can view your presentations only on a computer that uses Windows 2000,
Windows XP, or Windows Vista.
When you package a presentation on a CD, PowerPoint includes a stripped-
down version of PowerPoint designed just to run and display presentations.
You won’t be able to change your presentation.

Chapter 12: Showing Off a Presentation

To package up your presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and choose Send➪Publish for CD.
The Package for CD dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-15.
Rather than save a presentation to a CD, you can click the Copy to
Folder button and specify a different drive and folder, such as a USB
removable drive.
2. Click in the Name the CD text box and type a descriptive name for
your presentation.
3. Insert a blank CD in your rewritable CD drive.
4. Click Copy to CD.
If your presentation includes hyperlinks to other programs, PowerPoint
displays a dialog box to alert you. This dialog box is meant to keep you
from accidentally creating a presentation that could spread viruses or
Trojan Horses.
5. Click Close.

Getting Organized
with Outlook

In this part . . .
A
fter a few days on the job, most people’s desks dis-
appear under a pile of memos, reports, and papers.
If you want to actually use the top of your desk as a writ-
ing surface rather than a filing cabinet or garbage bin, you
may need the help of Microsoft Outlook (a combination
e-mail program and personal information organizer) to
save the day.
In addition to helping you create, send, receive, and sort
through your e-mail, Outlook also organizes your appoint-
ments, tasks, and important contacts. With the help of
Outlook, you can track meetings and appointments you’d
rather avoid, store the names of people you might forget,
and organize e-mail in a single location so that you don’t
have to search frantically all over your hard drive for an
important message that could determine the future of
your career or your business.
Outlook can handle all your personal information so you
can focus on doing the work that really needs to get done.
Who knows? If Outlook makes you productive enough at
work, you just may find that you have enough time to
relax and take that extended lunch break you’ve needed
for so long.

M
icrosoft Outlook is the personal organizer portion of Office 2007, able to
handle information such as your appointments, names and addresses
of important people, and list of to-do tasks. However, one of the most popular
uses for Outlook is reading, writing, and organizing your e-mail.
Configuring E-Mail Settings
The first time you run Outlook, you’ll need to configure your e-mail account
information. To retrieve e-mail from your account within Outlook, you need
to know the following:
 Your name
 The username of your e-mail account, which might be JSmith (for
Joe Smith)
 Your e-mail address (such as JSmith@microsoft.com)
 Your e-mail account password
 Your e-mail account type (either POP3 or IMAP)
 Your incoming mail server name (such as pop.microsoft.com)
 Your outgoing mail server name (such as smtp.microsoft.com)

Outlook can often recognize many popular e-mail accounts such as HotMail,
but if Outlook can’t set up your e-mail account automatically, you will need to
ask your Internet service provider (ISP) for all of these details.
Configuring an e-mail account the first time you run Outlook, follow these
steps:
1. Load Outlook.
A dialog box appears, letting you know Outlook is preparing to configure
your e-mail account settings.
2. Click Next.
The Account Configuration dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
3. Select the Yes radio button and then click Next. (If you click the No
radio button, you can always configure Outlook to access your e-mail
account later.)
The Add New E-mail Account dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-2.
In most cases, you’ll use the default setting that has the Microsoft
Exchange Server, POP3, IMAP, or HTTP radio button selected.
Figure 13-1:

Configu-
ration dialog
box lets you
choose

5. Type your name, e-mail address, and password in the appropriate text
boxes and then click Next.
Another dialog box appears, letting you know Outlook is trying to automat-
ically detect the rest of your e-mail account settings. (If Outlook succeeds
in configuring your e-mail account settings, you’re done. Otherwise, con-
tinue with the rest of the steps.)
6. Select the Manually Configure Server Settings check box and then
click Next.
Another Add New E-mail Account dialog box appears, asking you to
define the type of e-mail account you want to set up — either Internet
E-mail or Microsoft Exchange Server — as shown in Figure 13-4.
Most home computers connect to the Internet through the Internet
E-mail option, but many corporate computers connect to the Internet
through the Microsoft Exchange Server option.
7. Click Next.
The Add New E-mail Account dialog box appears that displays text
boxes for entering your server settings, as shown in Figure 13-5.
8. Type in your incoming and outgoing mail server settings.
The incoming and outgoing mail server settings typically put the letters
pop and smtp in front of your ISP’s name, such as pop.isp.com and
smtp.isp.com.

9. Click the Test Account Settings button.
Outlook attempts to connect to the Internet and send a message to your
e-mail account to verify that everything is working.
10. Click Next.
Another dialog box appears to inform you that you’re done setting up
your e-mail account.
11. Click Finish.
Adding an e-mail account
After you configure your initial e-mail account in Outlook, you can always add
(or delete) an e-mail account later. To add a new e-mail account, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings.
The Account Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-6.
2. Click New.
The Add New E-mail Account dialog box appears (refer to Figure 13-2).
3. Follow Steps 4–10 in the preceding section, “Configuring E-Mail
Settings.”

Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

Deleting an e-mail account
You can always delete an e-mail account at any time. To delete an e-mail
account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings.
The Account Settings dialog box appears (refer to Figure 13-6).
2. Click the e-mail account you want to delete.
3. Click Remove.
A dialog box appears, asking you to verify whether you want to delete
your e-mail account.
4. Click Yes (or No).
If you click Yes, Outlook removes your e-mail account.
If you delete an e-mail account, Outlook still saves any e-mail messages it has
already retrieved from your account.
Editing an e-mail account
If you’ve already configured an e-mail account, you may need to make changes
to it later, such as changing your password periodically. To edit an existing
account

266
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings.
The Account Settings dialog box appears (refer to Figure 13-6).
2. Click the e-mail account you want to edit and then click Change.
The Change E-mail Account dialog box appears (which displays options
similar to those shown in Figure 13-5).
As an alternative to clicking the Change icon, you can also click the
Repair icon to have Outlook try to automatically configure your e-mail
account settings.
3. Make any changes, such as changing the password or incoming or out-
going mail server settings, and then click Next.
A dialog box appears to inform you that you’ve changed your settings.
4. Click Finish.
Creating E-Mail
After you set up an e-mail account, you can start sending e-mail. The three
ways to create and send e-mail are
 Create a message and type the recipient’s e-mail address manually.
 Reply to a previously received message. Outlook then adds the recipi-
ent’s e-mail address automatically.
 Create a message and use a previously stored e-mail address. Outlook
adds the e-mail address automatically.
Creating a new e-mail message
The most straightforward way to send a message is to type the recipient’s
e-mail address and then type your message. To create a new e-mail message
and type the e-mail address, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Click the New button (don’t click the downward-pointing arrow
next to the New button).
• Choose Actions➪New Mail Message.
• Press Ctrl+N.
267
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

The message window appears, as shown in Figure 13-7. Notice that the
message window displays a Ribbon with Message, Insert, Options, and
Format Text tabs.
3. Click in the To text box and type the e-mail address of the person you
want to receive your message.
Make sure you type the e-mail address correctly. One incorrect charac-
ter, and your message won’t go to your intended recipient.
4. (Optional) Click in the Cc text box and type another e-mail address to
send the message to more than one person.
5. Click in the Subject text box and type a brief description of your 
message.
Many people use spam filters that examine the Subject line of a message,
so it’s a good idea to not type your subject text in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS
or use multiple exclamation points!!! Otherwise, your recipient’s spam
filter may inadvertently flag your message as spam and delete it before
anyone can even read it.
6. Click in the message text box and type your message.
Figure 13-7:
The
message
window lets
you type
and format a

268
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
7. Click the Send icon to send your message.
Replying to an e-mail message
Oftentimes. you may receive a message from someone else and want to send
a reply to that person. When you send a reply, Outlook automatically copies
the original message as part of your e-mail so that way the recipient can read
the original message that you’re responding to.
Even better, when you reply to a message, you won’t have to retype the recip-
ient’s e-mail address and risk misspelling it. To reply to an e-mail message,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Click the Inbox folder.
Outlook displays the Inbox pane that lists all the messages you’ve
received.
3. Click a message that you wish to reply to.
Outlook displays the contents of that message in a pane on the right
side of the Outlook window.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Reply icon.
• Choose Actions➪Reply.
• Press Ctrl+R.
Outlook displays a message window with the recipient’s e-mail address
and subject line already typed in along with a copy of the original 
message.
5. Click in the message text box and type your message.
If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
6. Click the Send icon.
269
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

Using a stored e-mail address to 
create a new e-mail message
If you’ve stored names and e-mail addresses (see Chapter 14), you can
retrieve an e-mail address so you don’t have to type it in yourself. To retrieve
a stored e-mail address, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Choose Actions➪New Mail Message (or press Ctrl+N).
The message window appears (refer to Figure 13-7).
3. Click the To button.
The Contacts dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
4. Click a name to select it.
5. Click the To button to copy your chosen e-mail address to the To text
box.
6. (Optional) Click additional e-mail addresses and then click the Cc or
Bcc button.
Cc stands for Carbon Copy while Bcc stands for Blind Carbon Copy.
Anyone on the Cc list will receive your message along with all the e-mail
addresses that also received your message. Anyone on the Bcc list will
just receive your message but will not be able to see any other e-mail
addresses you may have sent your message to.
Figure 13-8:

7. Click OK.
Outlook automatically enters your chosen e-mail address in the To
text box.
8. Click in the Subject text box and type a brief description of your 
message.
9. Click in the message text box and type your message.
If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
10. Click the Send icon to send your message.
Forwarding an e-mail message
Sometimes you may receive a message, but rather than reply to it, you want
to send it (forward it) to someone else. Forwarding a message essentially
copies a message and sends it to someone else whom the original sender
may not even know. (This can be handy for sending incriminating e-mail mes-
sages to prosecutors trying to collect evidence to put your boss in prison.)
To forward a message, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Click a message that you want to forward to someone else.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Forward icon.
• Choose Actions➪Forward.
• Press Ctrl+F.
A message window appears that contains your chosen message.
If you try to forward a message that contains HTML code known as a
Web bug, Outlook may display a dialog box warning you that the content
of the forwarded message may send information back to the original
sender to verify that your e-mail address is valid.
4. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address. (Or click the
To button to choose a stored e-mail address.)
5. Click in the message window and type any additional text you want to
send along with the forwarded message.
6. Click the Send icon.
271
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

Attaching Files to Messages
Rather than just send plain text, you can also attach a file to your message.
This file can be anything from a picture, a song (stored as an audio file), a
program, or even another e-mail message.
Be careful when attaching files to messages because many ISPs put a limit on
the maximum size of an e-mail message, such as 10MB. Also try to keep any
file attachments small because if the recipient has a slow Internet connection,
downloading a large file attachment can take a really long time.
Attaching a file to a message
If you want to send someone a picture, video, audio file, compressed file, or
even an entire program, you need to attach that file to a message by following
these steps:
1. Follow the steps in the earlier section, “Creating E-Mail,” to create a
new e-mail message, type a subject, and type an e-mail address.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Attach File icon.
The Insert File dialog box appears.
4. Click the file you want to attach to your message and then click Insert.
Outlook displays an Attach button and text box in the message window,
as shown in Figure 13-9.
If you hold down the Ctrl or Shift key while clicking a file, you can select
multiple files at once.
5. (Optional) Click the Attach button to display the Insert File dialog box
so you can select more files.
6. (Optional) Right-click any file in the Attachment text box; when a pop-
up menu appears, choose Remove if you change your mind about
attaching a file to a message.
7. Click the Send icon.
Rather than select multiple files to attach to a message, you can compress or
zip multiple files into a single compressed file by using a separate program
like WinZip or by using the built-in Zip compression feature in Windows.
272
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

Attaching Outlook information 
to another message
Rather than attach a file, you might want to send information stored in
Outlook, such as contact information or a task. To attach Outlook informa-
tion to a message, follow these steps:
1. Follow the steps in the earlier section, “Creating E-Mail,” to create a
new e-mail message, type a subject, and type an e-mail address.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Attach Item icon.
The Insert Item dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-10.
4. Click a folder, such as Inbox or Contacts.
The dialog box displays a list of the items stored in your currently
selected folder.
5. Click an item, such as an e-mail message stored in the Inbox folder.
Figure 13-9:

273
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

6. Click OK.
Outlook attaches your chosen item to the message window.
7. Type an e-mail address, subject, and any text in the message window.
8. Click the Send icon.
Formatting E-Mail
Plain e-mail will just look like black text against a white background. If you
want to spice up the appearance of your e-mail messages, you can use sta-
tionery or text formatting tools. You can also use signature files to display
unique information in every message you send, such as your name and
phone number.
Formatting text
You can format text in an e-mail message just the same way you can format
text in a Word document, such as changing fonts, choosing different colors,
underlining text, or creating numbered lists.
Outlook displays basic formatting tools, such as the Font list box, on both the
Message tab and the Format Text tab, as shown in Figure 13-11.
Figure 13-10:
Choose an

274
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

Not all computers and e-mail programs are capable of viewing formatted text.
To format text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to format.
2. Click the Message or Format Text tab.
The Format Text tab displays additional formatting tools such as creating
numbered and bullet lists, and aligning text to the right, center, or left.
Adding signatures to your messages
Signatures contain text that appears at the bottom of every e-mail message
you send. Signatures can be useful for displaying your name, company, Web
site address, or short message that you want everyone to read when they
receive a message from you.
Be careful about including personal information in a signature, such as your
home phone number. If someone forwards your e-mail that has your signa-
ture at the bottom, some stranger could read your signature text and use
your information against you to hack into your computer or steal your iden-
tity. As a general rule, only put information in your signature file that you
don’t mind sharing with a world full of strangers.
To create a signature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.

5. Click the New button.
The New Signature dialog box appears.
6. Type a descriptive name for your signature file and then click OK.
7. Click in the text box and type the text that you want to include in your
signature file, such as your name, company, Web site, and so on.
You can also format your text at this point. Just be aware that some
computers and e-mail programs may not be able to display all the for-
matting correctly.
8. Click the Save button.
9. (Optional) Click in the Replies/Forwards list box and choose the name
of your signature file that you defined in Step 6.
10. Click OK twice.
Now every time you create a new e-mail message, Outlook automatically
inserts the text you saved in your signature file.
Creating and using multiple signatures
You can actually create multiple signature files although Outlook will attach
only one signature file to your e-mail messages automatically. Creating multi-
ple signature files lets you create one signature file for personal use and one
for business use. (Just make sure you don’t get the two of them confused and
send out personal information in your signature file to your business contacts.)
To create additional signatures, follow Steps 1–10 in the preceding section,
“Adding signatures to your messages.” After you create multiple signature
files, you can define which one to use by following these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1–5 in the “Creating a new e-mail message” section to
create a new message.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Signature icon in the Include group.
A pull-down menu appears that displays a list of your existing signature
files, as shown in Figure 13-14.
4. Click the name of the signature file you want to use.
Outlook displays that signature file’s text in your e-mail message.
5. Type your message in the text box.
6. Click the Send icon to send your message.
277
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

signature file, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the Mail Format tab.
3. Click the Signatures button.
The Signatures and Stationery dialog box appears (refer to Figure 13-13).
4. Click a signature filename.

Reading and Organizing E-Mail
When Outlook retrieves e-mail, it organizes messages according to time.
Messages received today appear under the Today heading, messages
received last week appear under the Last Week heading, and messages
received last month appear under the Last Month heading.
Outlook gives you two ways to read an e-mail message:
 In the Preview pane
 In a separate window
The Preview pane can be handy for browsing the content of different messages
to see if you really want to read them or not. Because the Preview pane shows
only part of the message, some text may appear cut off.
Viewing a message in a separate window is more useful when you want to
read the entire message. Figure 13-15 shows what the same message looks
like in the Preview pane (top) and in a separate window (bottom).
To view an e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Click a message in the Inbox pane.
Outlook shows your chosen message in the Preview pane.
3. (Optional) Double-click the message in the Inbox pane.
Outlook displays your message in a separate window.
4. Click the Close box to make the message window disappear.
Categorizing messages
One problem with receiving messages is that you may have personal and
business messages mixed together, and trying to find an older message later
can involve tedious searching through your past messages, one by one.
To solve this problem, Outlook lets you categorize messages according to
color. You may use red to highlight important messages, yellow to highlight
personal messages, green to highlight business messages that involve money,
and so on.
279
Chapter 13: Organizing E-Mail with Outlook

Color categorizing a message
To categorize a message, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail. (You can also press Ctrl+1 or click the Mail button in
the lower-left corner of the Outlook window.)
Outlook displays the Mail pane.
2. Click a message in the Inbox pane.
3. Choose Actions➪Categorize.

To clear color categories from a message, follow these steps:
1. Click a message that contains a color category.
2. Choose Actions➪Categorize➪All Categories.
The Color Categories dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-18.
3. Select the check boxes to add or remove a color category from the
message you selected in Step 1.
4. Click OK.
If you want to clear color categories from all messages, choose Actions➪
Categorize➪Clear All Categories.
Retrieving a file attachment from a message
Rather than just send text, people might send you pictures, word processor
documents, or databases as file attachments. When you receive a message
with a file attachment, Outlook displays a paper clip icon next to the mes-

B
efore computers, most people stored the names and addresses of
important people in a Rolodex file. Rolodex files are great for storing
names, but it can take time to find those names again.
Obviously, such a clumsy process has no place in today’s world. Rather than
store names and addresses in a paper file, you can store names and addresses
in Outlook. Outlook’s biggest advantage is that it can store, sort, and find
names and addresses in ways much faster than an ordinary Rolodex file.
If you use a Windows Mobile device, you can synchronize and share your
Outlook data between your computer and your PDA (personal digital assis-
tant) so you can keep your list of names and addresses with you at all times
(or until you lose your PDA and/or computer).
Storing Contact Information
You can store as much or as little information about each contact as you
wish, such as someone’s name, e-mail address, street address, work number,

home number, cell phone number, fax number, birthday, job title, and Web
page address, and add a photograph as well.
To store names and other contact information, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts. (You can also click the Contacts button that
appears on the left side of the Outlook window or press Ctrl+3.)
Outlook displays a list of your current contacts.
2. Click New.
The Contact window appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
3. Click in the Full Name text box and type a person’s name.
4. (Optional) Type any additional information that you want to store
about a person, such as additional telephone numbers or e-mail
addresses.
5. Click Save & Close (to save your current contact information) or click
Save & New (to save your current contact information and open a new
Contact window to store another name).
Both the Save & Close and the Save & New icons appear in the Actions
group.
Figure 14-1:
The Contact
window lets
you store
names and

288
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

Searching Contact Information
After you store names, you may have another problem. How do you find
a name without browsing through your entire contact list one by one?
Fortunately, you can search your list of contacts by name, by either typing
the complete name or part of the name.
To search your list of contacts in Outlook, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Click in the Search Contacts list box, as shown in Figure 14-2.
3. Type all or part of a name.
Type only as many letters in a person’s name as you know because if
you misspell a name, Outlook won’t find it. The more letters you type,
the faster Outlook can search and the more likely it will find the name
you want.
4. Press Enter when you’ve typed as much of the correct spelling of a
name as you can.
Outlook displays only those names that match the text you typed in Step 3.
5. Click the name you want and then click OK.
Outlook displays your chosen name in the Contact window.

Chapter 14: Storing Contacts and Organizing Tasks

Viewing and Printing 
Contact Information
Outlook can display your contact list in several different views, such as show-
ing only names and phone numbers or showing names and street addresses
along with phone numbers and e-mail addresses.
After you find a view that you like, you can edit individual names or print your
entire contact list. To display and print your contact list, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Choose View➪Current View (or click the Current View pane on the
left side) to view the list of different viewing options displayed as
radio buttons, such as Business Cards or Address Cards. (If this list is
already visible, skip this step.)
3. Select the radio button to choose how to display your contacts, such
as Business Cards.
Outlook displays your contacts in your chosen style, as shown in
Figure 14-3.

4. Double-click a contact to open it in the Contact window so you can
edit it. Then click the Save & Close icon when you’re done.
5. Choose File➪Print Preview.
Outlook shows you what your contact list will look like when printed, as
shown in Figure 14-4.
6. Click Print.
If you just want to print information from a single contact, right-click that
contact and choose Print.
Categorizing Contact Information
If you collect enough names, your contact list may soon get unwieldy with both
personal and business contact information jumbled together. To help you sort
out your contact list, you can assign each contact to one or more categories.
For example, one category may be Personal Friends while another may be
Customers. (You can assign a contact to multiple categories, too, such as
putting someone’s entry under both the Personal Friends and Customers 
categories.)

Chapter 14: Storing Contacts and Organizing Tasks

Creating categories
Before you organize your contacts into categories, you need to define your
different categories. Outlook creates default categories that are color-coded
and named Blue Category or Red Category, but you’ll need to customize
these categories for your own use.
To create your own categories, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Click a contact.
3. Choose Actions➪Categorize.
A menu appears, as shown in Figure 14-5.
4. Choose All Categories.
The Color Categories dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-6.

5. Click a category (such as Blue Category) and then click the Rename
button.
Outlook highlights the category name.
6. Type a new name for your category, such as Friends or Customers,
and then press Enter.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for each category you want to rename.
8. Click OK.
Storing names in categories
After you give distinct names to your categories, you can assign names to
one or more categories to help you search through your data.
To organize names into categories, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Choose Actions➪Categorize.
A menu appears listing all your available categories.
3. Select the check box of a category.
Repeat this step for each additional category you want to assign the
contact.

Chapter 14: Storing Contacts and Organizing Tasks

Viewing names by categories
After you assign names to different categories, you can view them organized
in different categories by following these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Choose View➪Current View to display a list of different categories,
such as Phone List or By Category.
3. Click By Category.
Outlook displays your contacts organized into categories, as shown in
Figure 14-7.
Sharing Contact Information
You may have the name and address of someone like the president and want
to share this information with someone else. You could just print this data
and force that other person to retype all this information back into their com-
puter all over again.

294
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 

Obviously, this is a clumsy solution, so Outlook offers another way to share
your contact information with others:
 As a vCard
 As an Outlook file
The vCard format is a standard for storing names and addresses, which many
personal information-organizing programs can import. If you need to share
your Outlook data with someone who isn’t using Outlook, you need to store
and share your data as a vCard.
If you’re sharing information with someone who also uses Outlook, you
can store your data as an Outlook file. Whichever format you choose
(vCard or Outlook format), you can then e-mail the contact information to
someone else.
To share contact information, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Contacts.
2. Click the contact you want to share.
3. Choose Actions➪Send Full Contact.
A pop-up menu appears.
4. Choose either In vCard Format or In Outlook Format.
An e-mail window appears.
5. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address.
6. Click Send.
Outlook sends your contact information to your chosen recipient.
Defining Tasks
To help you stay focused on the important tasks you need to accomplish for
each day, Outlook lets you create a to-do list. By using this list, you can see
what you need to do (and get a sense of accomplishment when you can cross
it off your list).
295
Chapter 14: Storing Contacts and Organizing Tasks

Chapter 14: Storing Contacts and Organizing Tasks

Organizing and viewing your tasks
Listing your tasks may be useful, but if you have a particularly long list of
tasks (which means you either have a lot of work or you’re falling way
behind), you can rearrange your task list to display tasks based on their due
date (such as overdue tasks, tasks that should be done within the next seven
days, tasks that are already completed, and so on).
To view your task list in different ways, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Tasks.
2. Choose View➪Current View.
Outlook displays a list of different options such as Detailed List or
Overdue Tasks, as shown in Figure 14-9.
You can also click the Current View tab and select a radio button to
choose a different way to view your tasks.
3. Select the way you want to view your list, such as Active Tasks or
Assignment.
Outlook changes the appearance of your task list. (The default task list
style is Simple List.)

Finishing a task
Despite that natural tendency to procrastinate, many people actually do 
complete the tasks they set for themselves. To tell Outlook that you’ve joined
this elite group, select the check box of the task you completed, as shown in
Figure 14-10. Outlook displays a check mark in the check box, dims the task,
and draws a line through the task.
Deleting a task
After you complete a task (or just decide to ignore it permanently), you may
want to delete it from Outlook so it doesn’t clutter up your screen. Here’s how:
1. Choose Go➪Tasks.
2. Choose View➪Current View.
Outlook displays a list of different options, such as Detailed List or
Overdue Tasks (see Figure 14-10).
3. Click a task.
4. Choose Edit➪Delete, press Ctrl+D, or click the Delete icon on the toolbar.
Outlook deletes your chosen task.
If you delete a task by mistake, press Ctrl+Z right away, and Outlook kindly
retrieves it for you.

ow you spend your time directly determines the quality of your life.
To help you spend your time wisely (or at least spend it on the tasks
you want to accomplish first, whether it’s wise to do so or not), you can use
Outlook as your electronic Day-Timer. The key to scheduling your time is to
first put down all the tasks that are most important to you, and then fill in the
gaps with the less-important tasks (like the stuff you’re supposed to be doing
at work). In this way, you can always be sure that you set aside time for your
crucial tasks first.
Setting Appointments
If you’re not careful, you can overload yourself with so many appointments
that you never have time to do any work, which may not be so bad if you
don’t like your job anyway. So to help you sort out your appointments and
keep them handy, Outlook keeps track of your busy and free time.
Making a new appointment
Outlook lets you schedule appointments for tomorrow or (if you prefer the
long view) decades in advance. To make an appointment in Outlook, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Calendar (or press Ctrl+2, or click the Calendar button).
Calendar view appears.

2. Click the Month tab to display the monthly calendar, as shown in
Figure 15-1.
3. Click the day that you want to schedule an appointment.

Storing Stuff 
in Access

In this part . . .
P
ersonal computers provide an excellent tool for stor-
ing large chunks of information in databases so you
don’t have to store this same information in filing cabinets.
Databases can not only store huge amounts of data, they
can also sort and search through that data, which makes
them particularly valuable to businesses that need to
track their customers, inventories, or assets. So it’s no
surprise that the more advanced (and expensive) versions
of Microsoft Office 2007 include a special database program
called (what’s in a name?) Access.
For those of you who enjoy deciphering computer termi-
nology, Access is a relational database. For those of you
who prefer English, the previous sentence means that
Access lets you store lots of stuff in a variety of ways so
you can find it again — fast — when you need it.
This part of the book gets you started storing stuff in
Access. The goal is to get you feeling comfortable enough
to create databases with Access so you can store great
huge stockpiles of useful information in your computer.

Chapter 16
Using a Database
In This Chapter
 Understanding how databases work
 Designing a database
 Editing a database
 Typing information into a database
 Closing a database
A
database is nothing more than a program to store useful bits of informa-
tion such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, or inventory part
numbers, shipping dates, customer codes, and any other type of information
that you think is worth storing.
To help you store information in a database, Office 2007 comes with the data-
base program, Access. Access provides two huge advantages over storing
information on paper. First, Access can store literally billions of chunks of
information (try doing that with a Rolodex file or a filing cabinet). Second,
Access makes it easy to search and sort through your information in the
blink of an eye.
The three main advantages of a computer database over a paper database are
 Massive storage: The largest computer database can fit on a hard disk,
but a paper database might take a roomful of file cabinets.
 Fast retrieval: Searching for a single name in a computer database is fast
and easy. Doing the same thing in a paper database is difficult, error
prone, and nearly impossible with a large database.
 Reporting: A report can help you make sense out of your data, such as
showing a list of customers who earn a certain amount of money and
live in a specific area. Trying to find this information in a paper database
is time consuming and error prone.

Understanding the Basics of a Database
A database is nothing more than a file that contains useful information that
you need to save and retrieve in the future. A database can consist of a single
name and address, or several million names and addresses.
A typical Access database file consists of several parts:
 Fields: A field contains a single chunk of information such as name,
street address, or phone number.
 Records: A record consists of one or more fields. A business card is a
paper version of a database record that stores fields (name, address,
phone number, and so on) about a single person (record).
 Tables: A table displays records in rows and columns, much like a
spreadsheet. Tables group related records, such as records of all your
customers or records of all your invoices.
 Forms: A form displays all the fields of a single record onscreen, mimick-
ing a paper form, so that you can add, edit, or view a single record at
a time.
 Queries: A query lets you retrieve certain information based on your cri-
teria such as only retrieving names and addresses of people who earn
more than $50,000 a year and have children.
 Reports: A report arranges your data in a certain way, such as showing
all customers who placed over 1,000 orders last year or all customers
who live within a certain ZIP code.
Access is known as a relational database. Basically, this means you can store
data in separate tables and link or “relate” them together to avoid duplicating
data in multiple tables. One table might contain customer names and addresses
while a separate, related table might contain those same customers’ purchase
orders.
Here are the two basic steps to using a database. First, you need to design
your database, which means deciding what type of information your database
will hold, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers,
and so on.
After you design a database, the second step is filling it with actual data,
such as typing the name Bob Jones in the Name field or the e-mail address
BJones@somecompany.com in the E-mail field.
The whole purpose of a database is to store information you need to retrieve
in the future, such as names and phone numbers of customers. For example,
there’s no point in storing the fax number for people if you’ll never need to
send them a fax.
312
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

When you first create a database, you’ll probably start out with a single table
that contains customer information. Inside the Customer Information table
will be multiple records where each record represents a single customer.
Each record will consist of multiple fields such as First Name, Company
Name, Phone Number, and E-mail Address.
To help you edit and view your database table information, you might eventu-
ally want to create a form that displays your fields on the screen mimicking a
paper form that’s easy to read.
If you find yourself searching for the same type of information on a regular
basis, such as looking for the names of your best customers (those who
order more than $1,000 worth of products from you a week), you can store
this search criteria as a query. Then you can just click on the query name and
make Access show you exactly what you want to find.
Finally, you may want to print out your data in a way that makes sense to
you, such as printing a quarterly sales report. By saving your printing criteria
in a report, you can make Access print out selected data on a page that’s easy
for you to read and understand.
Features like forms, queries, and reports are optional but handy. Features like
tables, records, and fields are necessary to store your information in your
database.
Designing a Database
To design a database, you need to first create a database table and then
define the names of all the fields you want to store in that particular table.
Database tables let you divide a file into separate parts. For example, one
database table may hold the names and addresses of all your customers, a
second database table may hold the names and addresses of all your employ-
ees, and a third database table may hold the names and addresses of your
suppliers. Access stores all this related information in a single Access file
that’s saved on your hard disk, as illustrated in Figure 16-1.
To design your database, you can create a database from scratch or use an
existing template, which you can modify. Designing a database means defin-
ing both the number of fields to use for storing information and the maximum
amount of data each field can hold.
If you have a field that stores last names, what is the maximum number of
characters you want the field to hold? If you make the field hold too few char-
acters, people with long last names (maybe they’re hyphenated) won’t be
able to enter their entire name. Conversely, if you make the field hold too
many characters, you waste storage space.
313
Chapter 16: Using a Database

Similarly, if you have a field that stores numbers, what are the maximum and
minimum limits on the numbers you want to save in that field? If you’re stor-
ing someone’s age, you probably don’t want the field to contain negative
numbers or numbers beyond 200. If your field needs to hold salaries, the field
may need to hold large numbers but no negative numbers.
In general, store information in separate fields. So rather than create a single
field to hold someone’s full name, create two separate fields: One field holds
a first name, and the second field holds the last name. By storing last names
in a separate field, you can easily yank last names out of your database to
create form letters that state, “The Smith family has just won $20,000 dollars
in the Publisher’s Sales Pitch Sweepstakes!”
Creating a database from scratch
Access can create a blank database or a database using one of many tem-
plates available from the Microsoft Web site. No matter how you create a
database, you will likely need to modify it to customize it for the type of data
you want to store.
To create a blank database, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and choose New.
The Getting Started with Microsoft Access screen appears.
2. Click the Blank Database icon.
The File Name text box appears in the right corner of the screen, as
shown in Figure 16-2.
3. Type a descriptive filename for your database.
You may want to click the Browse icon to specify a different folder or
drive to store your database.

4. Click Create.
Access displays a blank table and an Add New Field text box, as shown
in Figure 16-3. Displaying your database in rows and columns is
Datasheet view.
When you create a database, Access automatically creates a special ID field
to help you sort and organize your data. (You don’t have to use this ID field if
you don’t want to.)

Chapter 16: Using a Database

Creating a database from a template
Just like it’s easier to copy someone else’s work, it’s easier to use an existing
database template and modify it for your own needs.
You need an Internet connection to retrieve any database templates from the
Microsoft Web site.
To create a database file from a template, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and choose New.
The Getting Started with Microsoft Access screen appears.
2. Click a category under the From Microsoft Office Online category,
such as Business or Education.
A list of available templates appears, as shown in Figure 16-4.
3. Click a template.
Access displays a default name in the File Name text box in the bottom-
right corner of the screen.
4. Type a descriptive name for your database in the File Name text box
and then click Create.
Access displays your database in rows and columns (Datasheet view).

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

Editing and Modifying a Database
After you create a database from scratch or from a template, you need to
modify it by giving each field a descriptive name, defining the size of each
field, or adding and deleting a field.
Naming a field
If you create a database from scratch, Access displays generic field names such
as Field1. If you create a database from a template, you’ll see the descriptive
field names, but you may still want to rename the fields to something else.
To rename a field, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the Access database file you want to modify and then click Open.
Access displays your chosen database.
3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the table
that contains the fields you want to rename.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
4. Click the Datasheet tab.
5. Click the field (column head) that you want to rename.
6. Click the Rename icon in the Fields & Columns group.
Access highlights the field name.
7. Type a new name for your field and then click outside the field name
when you’re done.
Adding and deleting a field
Sometimes you may need to add a field to make room to store new informa-
tion. Other times, you may want to delete a field that you don’t really want
after all. To add a field to a database table, follow these steps:
1. Click an existing field in your database table.
2. Click the Datasheet tab.
3. Click the Insert button in the Fields & Columns group.
Access inserts a new field (column) in your database table.
317
Chapter 16: Using a Database

To delete a field from a database table, follow these steps:
1. Click the field you want to delete.
Access highlights the entire column in your database table.
2. Click the Datasheet tab.
3. Click the Delete button in the Fields & Columns group.
A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to permanently delete all
the data in the field, as shown in Figure 16-5.
If you delete a field, you also delete any data that may be stored in that
field. Depending on how much data you have stored, you could wipe out
a lot of information by deleting a single field, so be careful.
4. Click Yes (or No).
If you click Yes, Access deletes your chosen field.
Defining the type and size of a field
The type of a field defines the type of data the field can hold (numbers, text,
dates, and so on), and the size of a field defines the amount of data the field
can hold (no numbers larger than 250 digits, any text string fewer than
120 characters, and so on).
The purpose of defining the type and size of a field is to make sure you store
only valid data in a particular field. If a field is meant to store names, you
don’t want someone typing in a number. If a field is meant to store a person’s
age, you don’t want the field to accept negative numbers.
To define the type and amount of a data a field can store, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home or Datasheet tab.
Figure 16-5:
Deleting a
field also
deletes
any data in
that field.

2. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the table
that contains the fields you want to define.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your table.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon, which
appears in the Views group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Click Design View.
Access displays the Design view of your database table, as shown in
Figure 16-6.
5. (Optional) Click in the Field Name column and edit an existing
field name.
If you click in a blank row, you can add a field to a database table.
6. Click in the Data Type column.
A downward-pointing arrow appears.

7. Click the downward-pointing arrow.
A pull-down menu appears, listing all the different types of data you can
define to store in a field, as shown in Figure 16-7.
8. Choose a data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time.
Access displays a General tab that contains different options for modify-
ing your chosen data type, as shown in Figure 16-8.
9. Click one of the data type options, such as Format or Input Mask,
listed under the General tab.
Sometimes you have to type a value directly into a data type option.
Other times a pull-down menu appears, from which you can choose
an option.
10. Repeat Step 9 for each data type option you want to modify.
You do not need to modify every data type option.

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

Typing Data into a Database
After you create a database table and define fields within that table to hold
chunks of information, you’re ready to type in actual names, phone numbers,
and e-mail addresses into each field. Access gives you two ways to enter data:
 Through Datasheet view
 Through Form view
Datasheet view displays information in rows and columns, where each row
represents a single record and each column defines a specific field name.
Datasheet view can be especially handy for examining multiple records at once.
Form view displays all the fields of a single record onscreen. Form view is
most useful when you just need to view or edit a single record, such as typing
in the phone number of your cousin or boss.
Using Datasheet view
Datasheet view is the default view for entering data. To view and enter data in
Datasheet view, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data in, and
then click Open.
Access displays your chosen database.
3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click a table.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your table.
4. Click in a field defined by the column and row.
Each column defines a field, such as a name or address. Each row repre-
sents a single record.
If you click in a field that already contains data, you can edit or delete
that data.
5. Press Tab to select the next field (or Shift+Tab to select the previous
field).
6. Type or edit the data in the field.
321
Chapter 16: Using a Database

Using Form view
The biggest problem with Datasheet view is that it can be confusing to find a
field for a specific record. Because most people are familiar with paper forms
or index cards that arrange related data (fields) on a page, Access offers you
Form view.
Form view simply displays the fields of a single record onscreen. To use Form
view, you must first create a form and arrange your fields on that form. After
you create a form, you can add, edit, and view data through that form.
Creating a form
The simplest way to create a form is to let Access design one for you, which
you can modify. To create a form quickly, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data. 
Then click Open.
Access displays your chosen database.
3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click a table.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
4. Click the Create tab.
5. Click the Form icon in the Forms group.
Access creates a form as shown in Figure 16-9. Notice that the form name
automatically uses the name of the database table you chose in Step 3.
6. Click the Office Button and then choose Save (or click the Save icon
on the Quick Access toolbar).
The Save As dialog box appears, asking you to type a name for your
form, as shown in Figure 16-10.
7. Type a descriptive name for your form in the Form Name text box and
then click OK.
Access displays your form’s name underneath the All Tables pane. The
next time you open this database and want to view the form, you can
double-click the form’s name in the left pane.
322
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

Viewing and editing data in a form
After you create a form, you can use it to edit and add data at any time.
To view a form, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data. Then click
Open.
Access displays your chosen database.

323
Chapter 16: Using a Database

3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the form you want to use.
Access displays the Form view of your database.
4. Click one of the following icons to display a record:
• First Record: Displays the first record stored in your file
• Previous Record: Displays the previous record in the file
• Next Record: Displays the next record in the file
• Last Record: Displays the last record that contains data
• New (Blank) Record: Displays a blank form so you can type in data
that will create a new record in your file
5. Click in a field and type the information you want to store, such as a
name or phone number.
You don’t need to use the Save command to save your changes because
Access automatically saves any data you add or edit in your file as soon as
you type or edit the data and move the cursor to a new field or record.
Editing a form
A form can be a convenient way to view all the fields of a single record.
However, you can always rearrange the position of certain fields onscreen
(to make them easier to find), or you can delete one or more fields altogether.
This can be handy to create a form that shows only a filtered view of your
data, such as a form that shows you only employee names, phone numbers,
and e-mail addresses rather than also showing you their salary and employee
ID number at the same time.
Deleting a field
If you delete a field from a form, you simply prevent the form from displaying
any data stored in that field. For example, if you don’t want to see each
person’s hire date, you can delete the Hire Date field from your form.
Deleting a field on a form doesn’t erase any data; it just keeps you from
seeing that data on a particular form.
To delete a field from a form, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
324
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data. 
Then click Open.
Access displays your chosen database.
3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the form you want to use.
Access displays the Form view of your database.
4. Click the Home tab.
5. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the
Views group.
A pull-down menu appears.
6. Choose Design View.
Access shows your chosen form in Design view, which displays a back-
ground grid to help you align fields on your form.
7. Click a field you want to delete.
Access highlights your chosen field.
8. Click the Delete icon in the Records group.
Access deletes your chosen field.
If you press Ctrl+Z right away, you can undelete any field that you just
deleted.
9. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the
Views group.
A pull-down menu appears.
10. Choose Form View.
Access shows your form with the deleted field missing.
Adding a field
Before you can add a field to a form, you must make sure that the field
already exists in your database table. For example, if you want to add a field
on a form that displays phone numbers, you must first create that field in
your database table and then stuff it with actual data.
To add a new field to a database table, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
325
Chapter 16: Using a Database

2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data. Then click
Open.
Access displays your chosen database.
3. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the database table that displays data through a form.
Access displays the Datasheet view, showing rows and columns.
4. Click the Add New Field column that appears to the right of your data-
base table.
Access highlights the entire column.
5. Click the Datasheet tab.
6. Click the Rename icon in the Fields and Columns group.
The cursor appears in the column heading you chose in Step 4.
7. Type a descriptive field name, such as E-Mail or Birthday, and then
press Enter.
8. Click in the column of the field you just created and named and then
type new data.
After you either create a new field or verify that a field already exists in a
database table, you’re ready to add that field to a form.
To add a field to a form, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the Access database file you want to add or edit data. Then click
Open.

Closing and Saving a Database
When you’re done using a database file, you can either close it or exit Access
altogether. Access gives you two options for closing a database:
 Close a single database table.
 Close the entire Access database file.
Closing a database table
Closing a single database table simply removes the data from view and leaves
Access running your loaded database file. After you close a database table,
you can open another one. (You don’t have to close a database table to open
another one, but if you know you won’t need to view a particular database
table, you might as well close it to get it out of the way.)
To close a database table, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the database table tab that you want to close.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 16-12.
2. Choose Close.
Access closes your chosen database table.
If you choose Close All, you can close all open database tables so you won’t
have to right-click each tab and close the tables one at a time.
Figure 16-12:

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

Closing a database file
Closing a database file keeps Access running so you can open another data-
base file. To close a database file but keep Access running, follow these steps:
1. Click the Office Button and then choose Close Database.
To exit Access, choose Exit Access instead.
If you haven’t saved any changes to the design of your database, a dialog
box appears, asking whether you want to save your changes.
2. Click Yes (or No).
Access remains running so you can load another database file.
When you save an Access database, you’re saving only the changes you made
to the database table or form. Access automatically saves any data you type
or edit in your database file. (When you type or edit data, Access saves it as
soon as you move the cursor to a new field or record.)

I
f you need to find a specific name in your database, searching through the
database alphabetically may be tedious but possible. However, if you need
to find the names of everyone who ordered more than $50,000 worth of sup-
plies in the past three months, trying to find this information yourself would
prove tedious and time-consuming. Yet, Access can search for this informa-
tion at the blink of an eye.
If you search for specific types of data on a regular basis, you probably don’t
want to keep telling Access what to search for over and over again. To sim-
plify this, you can create a query. A query lets you define specific ways to
search your data and save those parameters so you can search your data in
the future.
Besides searching through your data, Access can also sort your data. Sorting
can be as simple as organizing names alphabetically, or it can be more com-
plicated, such as sorting names according to ZIP code, annual salary, or
alphabetically by last name. Sorting simply rearranges your data so you can
study it from a new point of view.
By searching, sorting, and querying your data, you can extract useful infor-
mation about your data.

Searching a Database
A paper database is useful for storing information, but not so useful for find-
ing it again. If you have a thousand business cards stored in a Rolodex file,
how much time do you want to waste trying to find the phone number of a
single person?
Searching a database is crucial to make your data useful, so Access provides
two different ways to search a database:
 Search for a specific record.
 Use a filter to show one or more records that meet a specific criterion.
Searching for a specific record
The simplest type of search looks for a specific record. To search for a record,
you need to know the data stored in at least one of its fields, such as a phone
number and e-mail address.
The more information you already know, the more likely Access will find the
one record you want. If you search for all records that contain the first name
Bill, Access could find dozens of records. If you just search for all records
that contain the first name Bill, the last name Johnson, and a state address of
Alaska, Access will likely find just the record you want.
To search for a specific record in a database table, follow these steps:
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the database table you want to search.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Find icon in the Find group.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-1.
Figure 17-1:
Search for
a specific
record in a
database
table.
332
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

4. Click in the Find What text box and type in the data you know is
stored in the record you want to find.
For example, if you want to find the phone number of a person but you
know only that person’s last name, you type that person’s last name in
the Find What text box.
5. Click the Look In list box and choose the name of the entire database
table.
6. (Optional) Click in the Match list box and choose one of the following:
• Any Part of Field: The Find What text can appear in any part of a field.
• Whole Field: The Find What text is the only text stored in a field.
• Start of Field: The Find What text can be only at the beginning of
a field.
7. (Optional) Click in the Search list box and choose one of the following:
• Up: Searches from the record where the cursor appears, up to the
beginning of the database table
• Down: Searches from the record where the cursor appears, down
to the end of the database table
• All: Searches the entire database table
8. Click Find Next.
Access highlights the field where it finds the text you typed in Step 4.
9. Repeat Step 8 to search for more records that might contain the text
you typed in Step 4.
10. Click Cancel or the Close button.
Filtering a database
Searching a database is easy but somewhat limited because you can retrieve
only a record that matches any text that you want to find. If you want to find
multiple records, you can use a filter.
A filter lets you tell Access to display only those records that meet a certain
criteria, such all records that contain people who earn more than $200,000
a year, are currently married, live in Las Vegas, Nevada, and own two or
more cars.
To filter a database table, you must tell Access which field to use as a filter,
and then you must define the criteria for that filter. For example, if you want
to filter your database table to see only those records listing the names of
people who are at least 65, you filter the Age field and set the criteria to
Greater than or equal to 65.
333
Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database

Filtering simply hides all records in a database table that don’t match your
criteria. Filtering doesn’t delete or erase any records.
Using an exact match for a filter
The simplest filtering criterion searches for an exact match. When you filter
a field by an exact match, you’re telling Access, “I want to see only those
records that contain this specific chunk of data in this particular field.”
By using an exact match filter, you could display only those records that

To filter a database table, follow these steps:

5. (Optional) Clear one or more of the check boxes that appear to the left
of the list of data that appears in the field you chose in Step 3.
6. Click OK.
Access displays the filtered view of your database table.
7. Repeat Steps 3–6 for each additional field you want to filter.
Filtering by form
One problem with defining filters in Datasheet view is that you have all your
database table records cluttering the screen. To avoid this problem, Access
lets you define filters by using a form, which basically displays an empty record
so you can click the fields that you want to use to filter your database table.
To define a filter by form, follow these steps:
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the database table that you want to filter.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the Advanced icon in the Sort & Filter group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Choose Filter By Form, as shown in Figure 17-3.
Access displays a blank record.

5. Click in any field.
A downward-pointing arrow appears.
6. Click the downward-pointing arrow.
A pull-down menu appears, listing all the data currently stored in that
field, as shown in Figure 17-4.
7. Click the data you want.
You can only click on one entry in the list.
8. Click the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
Access displays a filtered view of your database table.
Using a filter criteria
Searching for an exact match in a field can be handy, but sometimes you may
want to see records that meet certain criteria, such as finding the names of
everyone whose salary is greater than $50,000 a year. Instead of filtering by
an exact match, you have to define the filter criteria.
The type of data stored in each field determines the type of criteria you can
create. Three common types of data stored in fields include Text, Numbers,
and Dates, which you can filter in different ways, as shown in Table 17-1.
Figure 17-4:

7. Type in one or more values in each text box displayed in the Custom
Filter dialog box and then click OK.
Access filters your database table according to your criteria.
8. Repeat Steps 5–7 for each additional filter you want to add.
Clearing a filter
When you apply a filter to a database table, you see only those records that-
match that filter. Access displays a Filtered message at the bottom of the
screen to let you know when you’re looking at a filtered database table.
To remove a filter so you can see all the records, choose one of the following:
 Click the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 Click the Filtered or Unfiltered button on the status bar near the bottom
of the screen.
Access temporarily turns off any filters so you can see all the information
stored in your database table.
When you choose the Save command (Ctrl+S) to save a database table, Access
also saves your last filter. The next time you open that database table, you’ll
be able to use the last filter you created. If you want to save multiple filters,
you’ll have to save them as a query (see the section “Querying a Database”
later in this chapter).
Sorting a Database
Sorting simply rearranges how Access displays your information. Sorting can
be especially handy for rearranging your records alphabetically by last name,
by state, or by country. You can also sort data numerically so that customers
who buy the most from you appear at the top of your database table while
customers who don’t buy as much appear near the bottom.
To sort a database table, follow these steps:
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name
of the database table you want to sort.
Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
2. Click the Home tab.
339
Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database

3. Click in a field (column) that you want to use for sorting.
4. Click the Ascending or Descending icon in the Sort & Filter group.
Access sorts your records and displays an Ascending or Descending
icon in the field name so you know you’re looking at a sorted list, as
shown in Figure 17-7.
5. Click the Clear All Sorts icon in the Sort & Filter group when you
don’t want to view your sorted database table any more.
Querying a Database
One problem with sorting or filtering a database table is that you must con-
stantly define what you want to sort or filter. In case you sort or filter your
data a certain way on a regular basis, you can use a query instead.
A query is nothing more than a saved version of your sort or filter criteria.
By saving the particular sort or filter criteria as a query, you can select that
query by name later.
Creating a simple query
If your database table contains dozens of different fields, you may find it con-
fusing to make sense of all your information. As an aid, a simple query strips
away fields so you see only the fields containing data you want to see, such
as a person’s name and phone number but not her hire date or employee
number.
Figure 17-7:
The
Ascending
and

8. Click in the text box, type a descriptive name for your query, and then
click Finish.
Access displays the results of your query as a separate tab.
9. Click the Office Button and then choose Save to save your query.
Creating a crosstab query
A crosstab query lets you combine two or more fields to calculate and display
a calculation based on a third field. For example, if your database contains
the names of salespeople and the products they sold, you can use those two
fields to create a crosstab that tells you how much each salesperson sold of
each product, as shown in Figure 17-12.
To create a crosstab query, you need to identify three types of fields:
 One to three fields to identify each record (such as the First Name and
Last Name fields)
 A single field to display specific data from each record (such as the
Product field, which displays the actual product names like Nails,
Barbed Wire, and Screws)
 A crosstab field that displays a calculated result (such as Sales)
To create a crosstab query, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create tab.
2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Other group.
The New Query dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-8).
Figure 17-12:

between one and three fields to identify each row (record), as shown in
Figure 17-14.
5. Click a field in the Available Fields box and then click the > button to
move your chosen field to the Selected Fields box.
6. Repeat Step 5 for each additional field you want to include.

7. Click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking for a single field to use to cross-
tabulate data with the fields you chose in Steps 5 and 6, as shown in
Figure 17-15.
8. Click a field name and then click Next.
Ideally, this field should consist of text information that lists different
data, such as sales regions (East, West, North, or South) or products
(Hammers, Screws, Nails, and so on). If you choose a field that contains
numerical data, your crosstab query displays only those numbers in the
column headings, which will appear meaningless. Another dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 17-16.

function that you want Access to calculate, such as Sum, Avg, or Count.
10. Click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking for a name for your query, as shown
in Figure 17-17.
11. Type a descriptive name for your query in the text box at the top of
the dialog box and then click Finish.
Access displays your crosstab query (refer to Figure 17-12).
12. Click the Office Button and choose Save to save your query.
Creating a query that finds 
duplicate field data
Suppose you sell a hundred different products. How can you tell which 
products customers are buying the most? To find the answer to this type of
question, you could search your database manually to find a Products Sold
field and then count how many times each product appears.
As a simpler solution, you can create a query that finds and counts how
many times duplicate data appears. To create a query to find duplicate
field data, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create tab.
Figure 17-17:
After you
create a
query, give
it a descrip-
tive name.
346
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Other group.
The New Query dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-8).

choose the database table to search.
4. Click a database table and then click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking you to choose the fields to examine
for duplicate data, as shown in Figure 17-18.
5. Click a field name and then click the > button. Repeat this step for
each additional field you want to search.
6. Click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking whether you want to display any
additional fields. If you choose to look for duplicate data in a Product
field (Step 5) to see which products are most popular, you can display
additional fields such as each salesperson’s name so you can also see
who is responsible for selling the most products.
7. Click a field and click the > button. Repeat this step for each addi-
tional field you want to display.
8. Click Next.
A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to give your query a
descriptive name.
9. Type a descriptive name in the top text box and then click Finish.
Access displays your query as a separate tab.
10. Click the Office Button and then choose Save to save your query.
Figure 17-18:

347
Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database

Creating an unmatched query
Access can store huge amounts of data, but the more data you store, the
harder it can be to view your data. To help you organize your data, you can
divide data into separate tables. One table may contain a list of customers,
and a second table may contain a list of salespeople.
When you store data in separate tables, each table may share one or more
common fields. For example, a table containing customers may contain a
SalesPerson field that shows which salesperson deals exclusively with which
customer. A second table listing salespeople could contain the Customer field
(along with additional information such as each salesperson’s phone number,
address, sales region, and so on).
An unmatched query examines two (or more) database tables to look for
missing information. For example, you could also use an unmatched query to
find customers who haven’t ordered anything in the past six months, sales
regions that haven’t ordered certain products, or salespeople who have not
been assigned to a sales region. Basically, an unmatched query can help you
find missing pieces or holes in your entire database file.
To create an unmatched query, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create tab.
2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Other group.
The New Query dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-8).
3. Click Find Unmatched Query Wizard and then click OK.
The Find Unmatched Query Wizard dialog box appears, asking you to
choose a database table that contains the unmatched records you want
to find.
4. Click a database table and then click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking you to choose a database table that
contains at least one field that also appears in the table you chose in
Step 3.
5. Click a second database table and then click Next.
Another dialog box appears, asking you to identify the field that both
database tables have in common, as shown in Figure 17-19.
6. Click the common field that both database tables share.
7. Click on the gray <=> button that appears between the two fields and
then click Next.
348
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

A dialog box appears, asking you to identify the fields you want to display
from the database table you chose in Step 4, as shown in Figure 17-20.

Manipulating the Data in a Report
After you create a report, you can manipulate the data displayed in that
report, such as sorting data in ascending or descending order, or applying
a filter that only displays data that meets a certain criteria.
By using a report, you can get a different view of your data. By manipulating
the data in a report, you can create alternate views of the same report. Some
common ways to extract information from a report include
 Counting
 Sorting
 Filtering
To manipulate data in a report, you must first display your report in Layout
view, which you can do by following these steps:
1. Make sure your desired report appears on the screen. (Follow Steps 1–3
of the first step list in the earlier section, “Viewing and Printing a
Report.”)
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the
Views group.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Choose Layout View.
Access displays your report in Layout view, which highlights an entire
column (field) at a time, as shown in Figure 18-10.
Figure 18-9:
The Print

Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report

Counting records or values
To make reports more useful, you can have Access count and display infor-
mation such as which products are selling the best or the total dollar amount
of each sale so you could tell exactly how much money your company made
during March. By counting records or adding up values stored in fields,
Access can help you better interpret the data displayed in a report.
You can count values only of fields that contain numbers; you cannot count
values of a field that contains text such as names.
To count the number of records or values in a report, follow these steps:
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following Steps 1–3 in the
preceding section, “Manipulating the Data in a Report.”
2. Right-click in the column (field) that you want to count.
Access highlights your chosen column and displays a pop-up menu, as
shown in Figure 18-11.
3. Click Total.
The menu command displays the Total command along with the field
name you right-clicked, such as Total Last Name or Total Sales.
Figure 18-10:

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 

Access displays a submenu that displays Count Records or Count Values.
4. Click either Count Records or Count Values.
Access displays the total count in your report.
If you choose the Count Records or Count Values command again, you can
hide the total count in your report.
Sorting a field
Access can sort each field in ascending or descending order. Sorting a field
simply rearranges the data in your report for your convenience. To sort a
column (field) in a report, follow these steps:
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following Steps 1–3 in the

Filtering a field
Filtering can tell Access to only display data that meets certain criteria, such
as a fixed amount. For example, if you have a report that lists all the sales of
products, you could filter your report to show only those products that sold
over a fixed amount, such as $1,000.
To filter data in a field, follow these steps:
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following Steps 1–3 in the
previous section “Manipulating the Data in a Report.”
2. Right-click in the column (field) that you want to filter.
Access highlights your chosen column and displays a pop-up menu
(refer to Figure 18-11).
3. Click Filters.
Depending on the type of data your column contains, the Filter com-
mand may appear as Text Filters or Number Filters.
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 18-12.
4. Click a filter criteria, such as Equals or Less Than.
Figure 18-12:

Depending on the criteria you choose, a Custom Filter dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 18-13.
5. Type your criteria in the Custom Filter dialog box and then click OK.
Access applies your filter to your report.
You can always turn off your filter by clicking the Home tab and then clicking
the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
Editing a Report
After you create a report, you may want to modify it later to expand the
space used to display data or eliminate fields altogether.
To edit a report, you must switch to the Design view of your report. After you
view the report in Design view, you can modify your report. To switch to the
Design view of a report, follow these steps:
1. Make sure your desired report appears on the screen. (Follow
Steps 1–3 in the earlier section, “Viewing and Printing a Report.”)
2. Click the Home tab.
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon that
appears in the Views group.
A pull-down menu appears.
4. Choose Design View.
Access displays your report in Design view, as shown in Figure 18-14.
At this point, you can move, resize, add, or delete fields on your report.
Text that appears in bold are labels that print identifying labeling text,
such as First Name or Sales Region. Text that appears in normal type
face (not in bold) represents fields that display data when you view
your report.

Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report

Resizing fields
When the Report Wizard creates a report, it doesn’t always leave enough
room to display your actual data. If a field is too small, Access may display
data as a series of x’s, such as xxxxx.
If this occurs, resize a field to make it wider. (If your data turns out to be
smaller than the field, you may need to shrink the field.) To resize a field,
follow these steps:
1. Display your report in Design view by following Steps 1–4 in the pre-
ceding section, “Editing a Report.”
2. Click the field you want to resize.
Access highlights your chosen field and its identifying label, as shown in
Figure 18-15.
3. Move the mouse pointer over the left or right edge of the field until
the mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
4. Drag the mouse to resize and expand or shrink the field.

5. Click the downward-pointing arrow under the View icon in the Views
group.
A pull-down menu appears.
6. Click Report View.
Access displays your report with your modified field size.
Deleting fields
If a report displays data that you no longer want to see, you can delete that
field from your report by following these steps:
1. Display your report in Design view by following Steps 1–4 in the ear-
lier section, “Editing a Report.”
2. Right-click the field you want to delete.

Deleting a Report
Eventually, you may find you no longer need a report, so you might as well
delete it. To delete a report, follow these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears in the left pane.
A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 18-8).
2. Click Tables and Related Views.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
fter spending your valuable time figuring out the
many powers and puzzles of Microsoft Office 2007,
flip through this part of the book to find out the secret
shortcuts and hints that can make any of the programs in
Microsoft Office 2007 even easier and more effective for
your personal or business use.
Just make sure that your family, coworkers, or boss don’t
catch you reading this part of the book. They may stop
thinking that you’re an Office 2007 super-guru and realize
you’re just an ordinary person relying on a book. (Why not?
Many of the best gurus do.)
Then again, why not buy extra copies of this book and
give them to your friends, coworkers, and boss so they’ll
be able to figure out how to use Office 2007 on their own
and leave you with enough time to actually do some
useful work?

Chapter 19
Ten Tips for Using Office 2007
M
icrosoft Office is famous for burying tons of useful features that most
people never know about, so this chapter is about exposing some of
Office 2007’s features so you can take advantage of them and make Office 2007
more convenient (and safer) for you to use.
Saving Office 2007 Files
Most people dump their documents inside a folder in the Documents folder,
so to make retrieving files easier, you can customize each Office 2007 pro-
gram to look for files in a specific folder.
In addition to defining a default folder to look for files, you can also define a
default file format for your Office 2007 programs. Finally, to protect your data
(as much as possible) from inevitable computer crashes and hard disk failures,
Office 2007 programs include a special AutoRecover feature, which saves a
temporary copy of your file at fixed intervals, such as every ten minutes.
That way, if the power goes out, you lose only those changes you made in
the last ten minutes and not all your changes.
Access doesn’t offer an AutoRecover feature because it automatically saves
any changes to your data anyway.
To customize the location, format, and AutoRecover feature of an Office 2007
program, follow these steps:
1. Load the Office 2007 program you want to customize (such as Word or
PowerPoint).
2. Click the Office Button.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click the Options button.
Depending on the program you’re using, the Options button may read
Word Options or Excel Options. An Options window appears.

4. Click Save in the left pane.
The Options window displays various Save options.
5. (Optional) Click in the Save Files in This Format list box and choose a
file format, such as the 97 – 2003 format to save files that are compati-
ble with previous versions of Office.
6. (Optional) Click in the Default File Location text box and type the
drive and folder that you want to define as your default folder.
(Or click the Browse button and then choose a folder.)
7. (Optional) Select the Save AutoRecover Information Every check box,
click in the Minutes text box, and type a value or click the up/down
arrows to define a value, such as 7 minutes.
8. Click OK.
Password-Protecting Your Files
To prevent prying eyes from peeking at your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files,
you can password-protect them. That way, if someone wants to open, view, or
edit your files, she must use your password. If someone doesn’t know your
password, she won’t be able to view — let alone edit — your files.
You can buy programs off the Internet that can crack an Office 2007 password-
protected file. For real security, don’t rely on Office 2007’s password-protection
feature.
To password-protect a file, follow these steps:
1. Load Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.
2. Click the Office Button.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Choose Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
4. Click the Tools button.
A pull-down menu appears.
5. Choose General Options.
The General Options dialog box appears.
6. (Optional) Click in the Password to Open text box and type a password.
Another dialog box appears and asks you to confirm the password by
typing it again.
370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

7. Type the password again and then click OK.
8. (Optional) Click in the Password to Modify text box and type a password.
This password can be different than the password you typed in Step 7.
Another dialog box appears and asks you to confirm the password by
typing it again.
9. Type the password again and then click OK.
10. Click Save.
You can create a password or remove passwords altogether by repeating
the preceding steps and retyping a new password or deleting the password
completely.
Guarding Against Macro 
Viruses and Worms
Macro viruses and worms are malicious programs designed to attach them-
selves to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. When an unsuspecting victim
opens an infected file, the virus or worm can spread and do something nasty,
such as deleting your files or your entire hard disk.
To stop these pests from wrecking your files, get an antivirus program, avoid
downloading or accepting any files from unknown people, and turn on Office
2007’s built-in macro protection feature, which can disable macros or restrict
what macro viruses and worms can do even if they do infect your computer.
To turn on macro protection, follow these steps:
1. Load Word or PowerPoint.
2. Click the Office Button.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
4. Click the Tools button.
A pull-down menu appears.
5. Click General Options.
The General Options dialog box appears.
371
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2007

6. Click the Macro Security button.
The Trust Center dialog box appears with the Macro Settings options
displayed.
7. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• Disable All Macros without Notification: The safest but most restric-
tive setting, this prevents any macros (valid or viruses) from run-
ning when you open the file.
• Disable All Macros with Notification: This is the default setting and
displays a dialog box that lets you turn on macros if you trust that
the file isn’t infected.
• Disable All Macros except Digitally Signed Macros: Blocks all macros
except for the ones “authenticated” (previously defined as
“trusted”) by the user.
• Enable All Macros: This setting runs all macros, which is the most
dangerous setting.
8. Click OK until you return to the Save As dialog box.
9. Click Save.
Create Your Own Word 
Keystroke Shortcuts
The more you use Word 2007, the more likely you’ll find yourself using cer-
tain commands. After a while, choosing these commands through Ribbon
tabs may get tedious, so Word gives you the option of defining your own
shortcut keystrokes to your favorite commands.
To assign a keystroke shortcut to a command, follow these steps:
1. Load Word 2007.
2. Click the Office Button.
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Click the Word Options button.
The Word Options window appears.
4. Click Customize in the left pane.
The Word Options window displays various Customization options.
5. Click the Customize button.
The Customize Keyboard dialog box appears.
372
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

6. Click on a tab name (such as Home or Page Layout) in the
Categories box.
The Commands box lists all the available commands stored within that
tab name.
7. Click a command in the Commands box.
The Current Keys box lists any shortcut keystrokes currently assigned
to your chosen command.
8. Click in the Press New Shortcut Key text box.
9. Press a unique keystroke combination, such as Ctrl+F7 or Alt+8.
10. Click Assign.
Word assigns your keystroke to your chosen command. If the keyboard
shortcut you choose is already assigned, Word will alert you.
11. Click Close.
The Word Options window appears again.
12. Click OK.
You can use your keystroke shortcut in any Word documents.
Zooming In (And Out) 
to Avoid Eyestrain
For many people, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint may display text too tiny to see
comfortably. To overcome this problem, you can increase the magnification
in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint so that text appears bigger without physically
altering the file itself.
Here are three ways to zoom in (or out) the magnification:
 Drag the Zoom slider that appears in the bottom-right corner.
 Hold down the Ctrl button and scroll the wheel of your mouse (assuming
your mouse has a wheel).
 Click the View tab and then click the Zoom icon in the Zoom group.
When a dialog box appears, click a magnification percentage (such as
125%) or type your own magnification percentage (such as 138%).
Changing the magnification only changes the way your text appears. Zooming
in (or out) doesn’t physically alter the text itself.
373
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2007

When in Doubt, Right-Click the Mouse
As a shortcut to giving commands to Office 2007, remember this simple
guideline: First select, then right-click.
So if you want to change text or a picture, first select it to tell Office 2007
what you want to modify. Then right-click the mouse to display a pop-up
menu of the commands. These pop-up menus display a list of only relevant
commands for the item you just selected.
Freezing Row and Column 
Headings in Excel
One problem with creating large spreadsheets in Excel is that your identifying
row and column headings may scroll out of sight if you scroll down or to the
right of your worksheet.
To prevent this from happening, you can “freeze” a row or column that con-
tains identifying labels. That way, when you scroll through your worksheet,
your frozen row or column always remains visible.
To freeze a row or column in an Excel worksheet, follow these steps:
1. Click the View tab.
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the
Freeze Panes icon in the Window group.
3. Click one of the following:
• Freeze panes: Divides a worksheet into multiple panes
• Freeze Top Row: Always displays the top row no matter how far
down you scroll
• Freeze First Column: Always displays the first column no matter
how far to the right you scroll.
To unfreeze a row or column, repeat Steps 1–3 but click Unfreeze Panes.
374
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Displaying Slides Out of Order 
in PowerPoint
When you display a PowerPoint presentation, your slides typically appear in
the order that you arranged them, starting with the first slide. If you want to
display your slides in a different order in the middle of a presentation, follow
these steps:
1. Load your presentation in PowerPoint and press F5.
The first slide of your presentation appears.
2. Type the number of the slide you want to view and press Enter.
If you want to jump to the fifth slide in your presentation, type 5
and press Enter. If you jump to the fifth slide, clicking the mouse or
pressing the spacebar next displays the sixth slide, then the seventh,
and so on.
Print a list of your slide titles and slide numbers on a sheet of paper so that
you know which slide number to type to view a particular slide.
Reduce Spam in Outlook
If you have an e-mail account, you will get spam, that unwanted e-mail that
clogs millions of inboxes every day with obnoxious offers for mortgage refi-
nancing, low-cost prescription drugs, or celebrity pornography. Unless you
actually enjoy deleting these messages manually, you can use Outlook to
filter your e-mail for you.
Setting up Outlook’s junk e-mail filter
Outlook can either color-code suspected spam or move it to a special junk
e-mail folder automatically. Because Outlook looks for keywords in spam, be
aware that it will never be 100 percent effective in identifying spam, but it can
identify the more blatant spam and save you time from deleting the messages
yourself.
375
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2007

To turn on Outlook’s spam filter, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Mail or press Ctrl+1.
Outlook displays the Mail and Inbox panes.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
3. Click the Junk E-mail button.
The Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-1.
4. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• No Automatic Filtering: Turns off the Outlook spam filter.
• Low: Identifies and moves most obvious spam to the Junk E-mail
folder.
• High: Identifies and moves nearly all spam into the Junk E-mail
folder along with some regular e-mail messages, too, so check the
Junk E-mail folder periodically to look for valid messages.
5. Click OK.
The Options dialog box appears again.
6. Click OK.

Creating a Safe Senders list
A Safe Senders list lets you define all the e-mail addresses you want to accept
messages from, and Outlook routes all e-mail from other e-mail addresses
directly to your Junk E-mail folder.
The advantage of a Safe Senders list is that it guarantees you will never
receive spam. On the down side, though, it also guarantees that if someone
tries to contact you whose e-mail address doesn’t appear on your Safe
Senders list, you will never get that valid message, either.
To create a Safe Senders list, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the preceding section,
“Setting up Outlook’s junk email filter” to display the Junk E-mail Options
dialog box. Then follow these steps:
1. In the Junk E-mail Options dialog box (refer to Figure 19-1), click the
Options tab.
2. Select the Safe Lists Only radio button.
3. Click the Safe Senders tab.
The Safe Sender’s tab of the Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears.
4. (Optional) Select (or clear) the Also Trust E-mail from My Contacts
check box.
Selecting this check box tells Outlook that if you store someone’s e-mail
address in your Contacts list, you will also accept e-mail from that
person, too.
5. (Optional) Select (or clear) the Automatically Add People I E-mail to
the Safe Senders List check box.
This tells Outlook that if you send e-mail to someone, you’ll accept his
or her messages in return.
6. (Optional) Click the Add button.
The Add Address or Domain dialog box appears.
7. Type a complete e-mail address. (Or type a domain name — for example,
if you trust everyone from Microsoft.com to send you valid e-mail,
type @microsoft.com in this dialog box.)
8. Click OK.
9. Repeat Steps 6–8 for each additional e-mail address or domain you
want to add.
10. Click OK until all the dialog boxes disappear.
377
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2007

Creating a Blocked Senders list
If a particular e-mail address persists in sending you spam, you can choose to
selectively block that single e-mail address or domain. To create a Blocked
Senders list, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the earlier section, “Setting up
Outlook’s junk email filter” to display the Junk E-mail Options dialog box.
Then follow these steps:
1. In the Junk E-mail Options dialog box (refer to Figure 19-1), select the
Safe Lists Only radio button.
2. Click the Blocked Senders tab.
The Blocked Senders tab of the Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears.
3. Click the Add button.
The Add E-mail Address or Domain dialog box appears (which looks just
like the Add Address or Domain dialog box).
4. Type an e-mail address or domain name and then click OK.
The Options dialog box appears again.
5. Click OK until all the dialog boxes disappear.
Using Pocket Office
Laptop computers may be light and handy for running Office 2007 on the
road, but sometimes you may not want to lug around a laptop computer
and its several pounds of dead weight. As an alternative, consider using a
Windows Mobile handheld computer instead.
Windows Mobile devices (formerly called Pocket PCs and Windows CE)
include miniature versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access, which
collectively are called Pocket Office. These Pocket versions of Office pro-
grams don’t include all the features of Office 2007, but they will let you view,
edit, and save your files so you can take them with you without the weight
and bulk of a laptop computer.
If you want the convenience of Office 2007 without the heft of a laptop com-
puter, Windows Mobile and Pocket Office may be for you.

Chapter 20
Ten Keystroke Shortcuts 
for Office 2007
O
ne common theme of Office 2007 is that all programs look and work
alike. After you get used to using the Ribbon tabs in Word, you’ll be
able to use the similar Ribbon tabs in Excel and PowerPoint without too
much trouble.
Even better, the same keystroke commands work alike in all Office 2007 pro-
grams. By memorizing the keystroke shortcuts in this chapter, you’ll be able
to work faster and more efficiently with Office 2007, no matter which particu-
lar program you may be using at the time.
Protecting Yourself with Undo 
(Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Y)
Many people are terrified of making a mistake using Office 2007, so they wind
up never learning any features that could save them time and make their
lives much easier. Any time you do anything in Office 2007, from deleting
or modifying text to adding a picture or page, you can always immediately
reverse — undo — your previous command by choosing the Undo command
(Ctrl+Z) right away.
Armed with the Undo command, you can experiment freely with different
commands. When things don’t work the way you thought, press Ctrl+Z and
undo your last changes.
If you wind up undoing a change and then suddenly realize you didn’t want to
undo that change after all, you can redo a command you previously reversed.
To redo a command that you had undone, choose the Redo command (Ctrl+Y).

To undo multiple commands, follow these steps:
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Undo icon on
the Quick Access toolbar.
A pull-down menu appears of all the latest commands you’ve chosen.
2. Highlight one or more commands on the Undo menu and click the last
command you want to undo.
3. (Optional) If you undo a command and suddenly want to redo it,
choose the Redo command by choosing one of the following:
• Click the Redo icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
• Press Ctrl+Y.
You can’t undo all commands. If a command cannot be undone, Office 2007
displays a dialog box informing you of this fact to prevent you from wiping
out valuable data.
Cut (Ctrl+X), Copy (Ctrl+C), 
and Paste (Ctrl+V)
Editing any file often means moving or copying data from one place to another.
Understandably, three of the most common commands are the Cut, Copy, and
Paste commands.
Both the Cut and Copy commands are most often used with the Paste com-
mand. However, the Cut command, without the Paste command, is essentially
equivalent to deleting selected text or objects.
Using the Cut and Paste commands
The Cut and Paste commands essentially move text or pictures from one
location to another, typically within the same file, but also from one file to
another file.
To use the Cut command, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or objects you want to move.
2. Choose the Cut command by clicking the Cut icon or pressing Ctrl+X.
Office 2007 removes your selected item from your file.
380
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

3. Move the cursor where you want to place the text or objects you
selected in Step 1.
4. Choose the Paste command by clicking the Paste icon or pressing Ctrl+V.
Office 2007 displays the cut items in the location you specified in Step 3.
Using the Copy and Paste commands
The Copy and Paste commands copy text or pictures from one location to
another location. To use the Copy command, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or objects you want to copy.
2. Choose the Copy command by clicking the Copy icon or pressing Ctrl+C.
Your selected item remains in its original location.
3. Move the cursor where you want to place the text or objects you
selected in Step 1.
4. Choose the Paste command by clicking the Paste icon or pressing Ctrl+V.
Office 2007 displays the copied items in the location you specified in
Step 3.
Using the Paste command 
with the Office Clipboard
Each time you choose the Cut or Copy command, Office 2007 stores that
selected data (text or pictures) on the Office Clipboard, which can hold up to
24 items. After you cut or copy items to the Office Clipboard, you can always
retrieve them.
If you turn off your computer or exit Office 2007, any items on the Office
Clipboard are lost.
To retrieve a cut or copied item from the Office Clipboard and paste it into a
document, follow these steps:
1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Clipboard icon in the Clipboard group.
3. Move the cursor to where you want to paste an item.
4. Click an item displayed on the Office Clipboard.
Office 2007 pastes your chosen item in your file.

Chapter 20: Ten Keystroke Shortcuts for Office 2007

Saving a File (Ctrl+S)
Never trust that your computer, operating system, or Office 2007 will work
when you need it. That’s why you should save your file periodically while
you’re working: If you don’t, and the power suddenly goes out, you’ll lose all
the changes you made to your file since the last time you saved it. If the last
time you saved a file was 20 minutes ago, you’ll lose all the changes you
made in the past 20 minutes.
It’s a good idea to save your file periodically, such as after you make a lot of
changes to a file. To save a file, choose one of the following:
 Press Ctrl+S.
 Click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
The first time you save a file, Office 2007 asks you for a descriptive name.
After you have saved a file at least once, you can choose the Save command,
and Office 2007 will save your file without bothering you with a dialog box.
Printing a File (Ctrl+P)
Despite all the promises of a paperless office, more people are printing and
using paper than ever before. As a result, one of the most common com-
mands you’ll use is the Print command.
To choose the Print command, press Ctrl+P or click the Print icon on the
Quick Access toolbar.
Checking Your Spelling (F7)
Before you allow anyone to see your file, run a spell checker first. Just press
F7, and Office 2007 diligently checks the spelling of your text. When the spell
checker finds a suspicious word, it displays a dialog box, as shown in Figure
20-1, that lets you choose a correct spelling, ignore the currently highlighted
word, or store the highlighted word in the Office 2007 dictionary so it won’t
flag that word as misspelled again.
Spell checkers are handy and useful, but they can be fooled easily. You might
spell a word correctly (such as their) but use that word incorrectly, such as
You knead two move over their. Spell-checking won’t always recognize gram-
matical errors, so you still need to proof your file manually just to make sure
you don’t have any misspelled words in your file.
382
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

If you don’t want Office 2007 to spell-check your entire file, just highlight the
text you want to spell-check and then press F7.
Opening a File (Ctrl+O)
Generally, you’ll spend more time working with existing files than creating
new ones. Here are two shortcuts to open an existing file:
 Use the Recent Documents pane from the Office Button.
 Press Ctrl+O.
The first shortcut appears in the Recent Documents pane from the Office
Button. Each Office 2007 program keeps track of the last files you opened,
so if you want to open one again, you can just click that filename.
To use the Recent Documents pane, follow these steps:
1. Load an Office 2007 program, such as Word or Excel.
2. Click the Office Button.
A pull-down menu appears and displays the list of Recent Documents.
3. Click a filename in the Recent Documents pane.
Your chosen file appears, ready for you to view and edit.
A second way to open a file quickly is to press Ctrl+O. This immediately dis-
plays an Open dialog box so you can click the file you want to open.

Chapter 20: Ten Keystroke Shortcuts for Office 2007

Creating a New File (Ctrl+N)
Each Office 2007 program offers two ways to create a new file:
 Choose the New command from the Office Button.
 Press Ctrl+N.
When you choose the New command from the Office Button, Office 2007 dis-
plays a New Document dialog box, which lets you create a blank file or a file
based on an existing template.
When you press Ctrl+N, Office 2007 immediately creates a blank file without
making you wade through any dialog boxes.
If you want to create a new file based on a template, choose the New com-
mand from the Office Button. If you want to create a blank file, press Ctrl+N.
Pressing Ctrl+N in Outlook 2007 creates a different item, such as creating a
new e-mail message or task, depending on what you’re doing with Outlook at
the time.
Finding Text (Ctrl+F)
The Find command lets you search for a word or phrase buried somewhere
within your file. To use the Find command, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+F.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears, displaying the Find tab.
2. Click in the Find What text box and type the word or phrase you want
to find.
3. (Optional) Click the More button to expand the Find and Replace
dialog box.
The More button expands the Find and Replace dialog box so you can
fine-tune your search to make sure you don’t wind up finding irrelevant
text by mistake.
4. (Optional) Select one of the following check boxes:
• Match Case: Use this to find Bill but not bill.
• Find Whole Words Only: Use this to find cat but not words like 
catastrophe or bobcat.
• Use Wildcards: Use this to find parts of text, such as all words that
being with fa, by typing fa* in the Find What text box. This would

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

find words such as fail and fattening. (This option is available only
in Word.)
• Sounds Like: Use this to find words phonetically, such as searching
for elephant by typing elefant in the Find What text box. (This option
is available only in Word.)
• Find All Word Forms: Use this to find variations of a word such as
sings, singing, and sang. (This option is available only in Word.)
5. Click Find Next and repeat this step to continue searching your file.
6. Click Cancel when you’re done.
If you select a chunk of text, you can make Office 2007 search within your
selected text only, rather than your entire file.
Finding and Replacing Text (Ctrl+H)
The Find and Replace command lets you substitute text throughout a file.
You could search and replace a phrase like Bill Johnson was a loser with the
phrase Bill Johnson was a failure.
To use the Find and Replace command, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+H.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears.
2. Click in the Find What text box and type the text you want to find.
3. Click in the Replace With text box and type the text you want to
appear instead.
4. (Optional) Click the More button and select one or more check boxes,
as defined in Step 4 of the preceding section, “Finding Text (Ctrl+F).”
5. Click Find Next.
Office 2007 finds the first occurrence of the text you typed in Step 2.
6. Click Replace or Replace All.
The Replace command lets you review each word before you replace it
to make sure that’s what you really want to do. The Replace All command
replaces text without giving you a chance to see whether it’s correct or
not. When using the Replace All command, be aware that Office 2007
may replace words incorrectly. For example, in addition to replacing
Bob with Frank, Office 2007 might also replace all occurrences of Bobcat
with Frankcat, which is probably something you don’t want to do.
7. Click Close when you’re done.

Closing a Window (Ctrl+W)
To close a window, you can either click on that window’s Close box or click
the Office Button and then click Close. For a faster alternative, just press
Ctrl+W and this closes the current window right away.
If you haven’t saved the contents of the current window, Office 2007 displays a
dialog box asking if you want to save your data before it closes your window.
