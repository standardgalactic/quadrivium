About the Authors
Ray Foley, a former Marine with more than 30 years of bartending and
restaurant experience, is the founder and publisher of BARTENDER magazine.
BARTENDER is the only magazine in the world specifically geared toward
bartenders and is one of the very few primarily designed for servers of
alcohol. BARTENDER magazine is enjoying its 27th year, currently has a
circulation of more than 150,000, and is steadily growing.
After serving in the United States Marine Corps and attending Seton Hall
University, Ray entered the restaurant business as a bartender, which
eventually led to his becoming assistant general manager of The Manor in
West Orange, New Jersey, with more than 350 employees. At The Manor, he
instituted a video-in-house training program — one of the first in the country.
Ray is very proud to say that many of his students are now serving in such
capacities as owners, managers, and vice presidents of national restaurants,
general managers of major hotel chains, as well as bartenders and waiters at
some of the nation’s finest dining establishments. In 1983, Ray left The Manor
to devote his full efforts to BARTENDER magazine.
Ray is the author of The Ultimate Cocktail Book; The Ultimate Little Shooter
Book; The Ultimate Little Martini Book; The Ultimate Little Blender Book;
Advice from Anonymous; Spirits of Ireland; Jokes, Quotes and Bartoons; and,
of course, Bartending For Dummies, now in its third edition. He has also pub-
lished numerous articles in many magazines, including Playboy and Men’s
Health, and has appeared on TV and radio shows, including The David
Susskind Show, ABC-TV News, CBS News, NBC News, Good Morning America,
The Joe Franklin Show, Larry King Live, Patricia McCann, WOR-TV, and Live
with Regis and Kathy Lee. Ray also serves as a consultant to some of the USA’s
foremost distillers and importers. He is also responsible for naming and
inventing new drinks for the liquor industry, including the Fuzzy Navel.
Ray is the founder of the Bartender Hall of Fame, which honors the best bar-
tenders throughout the United States, not only for their abilities as mixolo-
gists but for involvement in their communities. Ray is also the founder of The
Bartenders’ Foundation Inc. This non-profit foundation raises scholarship
money for bartenders and their families. Scholarships awarded to bartenders
are used to either further their own education or go toward the education of
their children.
Ray resides in New Jersey with his wife and partner of 25 years, Jackie, and
their son, Ryan. He is also the father of three other wonderful and bright
children: Raymond Pindar, William, and Amy.
Ray is foremost and always will be a Bartender.

A veteran of both the restaurant and publishing industries, Heather Dismore’s
published works include such titles as Running a Restaurant For Dummies,
Jewelry Making & Beading For Dummies (both published by Wiley), and most
recently, Start Your Restaurant Career, published by Entrepreneur Press. She
has contributed to many books on a variety of subjects, including Diabetes
Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition, John Paul II For Dummies, and Einstein
For Dummies.
A graduate of DePauw University, she succumbed to the restaurant business
while applying to law school. She orchestrated the openings of 15 new
restaurants and developed the training, procedural, and purchasing systems
that were used as the gold standard in numerous concepts throughout her
tenure. She rapidly rose through the ranks at such regional and national
chains as The Italian Fisherman, Don Pablo’s Mexican Kitchen, and Romano’s
Macaroni Grill.
She’s an active food writer and trend spotter in the food and beverage indus-
try and a regular contributor to FoodChannel.com. She can be contacted at
heather@heatherdismore.com. She lives in Missouri with her husband
and daughters, who are her first loves, inspiration, and never-ending source
of new material.

Dedication
Ray’s Dedication:
This book is dedicated to all who serve the public with long hours, tired
bodies, and great patience (and still know how to have fun): bartenders, bar
employees, owners, and maybe to a couple of great customers!
And, of course, to Jaclyn Marie, whom I love the best, and Ryan Peter, who
loves me the best. Both have made my cup overflow.
Heather’s Dedication:
I dedicate this book to my college friends with whom I first explored the
magic of bars and discovered the mystery contained therein: Tracy, Jeanne,
Biddle, Chrissie, Steph, Claire, Staci, Natasha, Lisa, Diz, Vince, Rock, Russ,
and all my other DePauw pals.

Introduction
T
he bar business is exciting. Every night’s a party. We’re thrilled you’re
looking to get involved, and you’ve definitely come to the right place to
get started. From the neighborhood bar to the local wine bar, opportunities
in the industry have never been greater. This book is your guide to getting
started in the right direction.
A lot of books have been written on being a bartender (heck, coauthor Ray
wrote Bartending For Dummies!), but to run a bar, you have to be more than
just a great bartender. To be the owner, you have to see beyond the glamour
of standing behind the bar flipping bottles, pouring draft beers, and chatting
up customers. You have to feel the anxiety, and the blood, sweat, and tears
that accompany it. As you read this book, we think you will come to under-
stand, if you don’t already, that the bar business really is a business. You
crunch numbers, make sales projections, watch labor costs, and so on, just
like in every other business. And ultimately, your success is judged like any
other business, on your profitability.
Whether you’re a salty bartender or a cocktail waitress looking at your long-
term goals, reading this book is a terrific step in launching your own business
in the bar industry. Read on for tips on how this book is organized.
About This Book
You don’t have to pass an exam or earn a degree to prove you can run your
bar. Instead, you have to work at it, gain experience, and have more than a
little common sense. We wrote this book to help you to determine what skills
you need to get into the business, and we help you figure out where you need
to fill in the blanks. After you read the pages between these gorgeous yellow-
and-black covers, you’ll have a good idea whether this is the racket for you —
and you’ll have the knowledge to get started on the right foot.

You can find plenty of books that tell you how to open a bar, but you won’t
find many about how to keep it open. This book does both. Why? Because
even after opening day arrives, you can never stop improving your service,
evaluating your product, scoping out the competition, or researching oppor-
tunities in the marketplace. Change is the only constant in this business. To
succeed, you must anticipate and act on new trends, new pressures, and
whatever else the market throws your way. The spoils go to those who see
opportunities before they happen.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book, we use the following conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the
action part of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars, which look like text enclosed in a shaded gray box, consist of
information that’s interesting to know but not necessarily critical to
your understanding of the chapter or section topic.
Foolish Assumptions
Bar owners have to make assumptions about the patrons sitting on the other
side of the bar, and authors have to do the same thing — we have to make
assumptions about our readers. With that in mind, we’ve come up with the
following list of assumptions about why you’ve picked up this book:
 You’re thinking about opening your own bar, and you want practical,
how-to advice to accomplish your goals.
 You’re a bartender or other bar employee who wants to take your ex-
perience to the next level and manage a bar.
 You’ve never worked in a bar but you’ve had success in other profes-
sional endeavors and have skills that you may be able to apply to this
business.
 You buy every book that sports a yellow-and-black cover.
 You currently own or operate a bar, and you’re seeking advice, tips, and
suggestions to keep things running smoothly and successfully.
2
Running a Bar For Dummies 

Here’s another assumption that we’ll address right now, just in case you’re
carrying this common misconception: Don’t think that you should open a bar
because you want a cool place to hang out. It’s tough to sit down in your bar
and actually relax. Typically, you can’t turn your management mind-set off
just because your friends or family come in. You’re too busy watching cock-
tails being made, looking at paper scraps on the floor, or looking at plates of
food going by, doing a sort of on-the-fly quality check. If you take time to actu-
ally sit down during a shift, you lose your control or awareness of what’s
going on. Even if you come in on the one day a month you’re off, you’ll still
probably be distracted by what’s going on around you.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts, shaken not stirred, and then topped
with soda and garnished with a lime twist. Here’s what’s in this operation
cocktail.
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started 
in the Bar Industry
In this part, we give you a crash course in the business, including tips for get-
ting started, understanding your options, creating your concept, and picking
your name. We include a detailed timeline from idea to grand opening to get
you up and running. We also help you decide whether you have what it takes
to make it in the business. Look here for information on getting financing and
following the letter of the law.
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors
In this part, we focus on developing your idea and making it a reality. We take
you through the critical steps, such as writing a business plan. We help you
find just the right location for your bar or make the most of the one you
already have. We also help you figure out what you need to stock your bar,
from equipment to appliances, bourbon to Budweiser, and everything in
between.

Introduction

Part III: Employees, Customers, and
Products: Managing the “Right Stuff”
Here, we help you find the best employees for your bar. We give you tips on
how to train them right so you can please the most important person in your
bar: your patron. We also give you great hands-on ideas for giving the best
possible customer service to keep your bar stools full every night of the
week.
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory,
Revenue, and Future
This part shows you how to manage what you’ve created. We help you wran-
gle every cent out of every dollar without being a cheapskate. We show you
how to buy premium products the right way to effectively manage your
inventory and cash flow. We give you details on which numbers to watch in
the bar business and why. We give you tips on how to bring in new customers
for the first time while still keeping your regulars regular. We help you build
goodwill in the community and reap the rewards in your business.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this standard For Dummies section, we give you tips for keeping your
employees and patrons safe in your place. We help you avoid common prob-
lems that plague many a bar owner. We dispel a few myths about the busi-
ness. And finally, we give you our favorite bar jokes to share with your
patrons, your barber, or anyone else who will listen.
Part VI: Appendixes
Not as flashy as the other parts, but equally as important, the appendixes are
terrific resources you can go back to again and again. Look here for a listing
of alcohol control boards by state. As an added bonus, we threw in a whole
bunch of Web sites that are monumentally handy to the above-average bar
owner, which you will likely soon be.

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the cute little pictures that appear in the margins of this book.
Here’s the guide so you can tell what they are and what they’re for:
The Tip icon calls your attention to ideas that can make your job easier and
help you sidestep problems. The tips often give you handy ideas on ways to
improve your business today.
The Remember icon points out where we reinforce the concepts we discuss.
If you’re in a time crunch and can’t read the entire chapter, you can go
straight to this icon and still come away with some very useful information.
The Warning icon alerts you to potential pitfalls and gives you a heads-up on
mistakes to avoid. Pay attention when this icon rears its head because it’s
there to show you something important.
The Technical Stuff icon alerts you to interesting, but not critical, background
information about the subject being discussed. You don’t have to read the
information to understand the ideas and concepts, but you may find it inter-
esting nonetheless.
Where to Go from Here
Because this is a For Dummies book, you don’t have to read it in order, word
for word, front to back, cover to cover. If you prefer, you can check out the
corresponding part, chapter, or section and read up on the issue that most
interests you, rather than plow through the entire book. You can find out
what you want to know without first having read the information that pre-
cedes it. In other words, this book gives you get-in-and-get-out convenience.
You can start wherever you want and read whatever you want. You can jump
around and finish reading when you feel like it. So grab your bar towel and
get going. Interested in tips for improving your drink menu today? Turn to
Chapter 9. Do you need a test to quiz your soon-to-be hotshot bartender?
Take a look at Chapter 10. Looking to get started on a new business plan? 
Flip over to Chapter 5. Need help choosing a name for your new place? 
You gotta see Chapter 6!

Running a Bar For Dummies 

Part I
Cheers! Getting
Started in the Bar
Industry

In this part . . .
W
e get you ready to get going in the bar business.
First, we outline the basics for you, so you have
an overview of just what kinds of issues and experiences
you may encounter in your bar or pub. Then we take you
through the ins and outs of what the business is like on a
day-to-day basis. We also help you explore the process for
minding all your legal “Ps & Qs.” And we help you refine
your ideas for what you want your bar to be by looking at
several hot concepts in the bar business.

Chapter 1
Bar Business Basics
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of the business
 Deciding whether you have the necessary skills
T
hink of all the great times people have in bars. They meet for girls’ night
out, bachelor parties, reunions, birthdays, or just because it’s Thursday.
They come to celebrate, relax, or have fun. It’s a fact: People like bars. So it’s
not a leap for people to think “Hey, I enjoy hanging out in bars, so I may as
well get paid to do what I enjoy — hanging out in bars.”
Viewed from the bar stool (on the public side of the bar), it’s easy to miss all
the hard work that goes on to make hanging out in bars fun for everyone else.
When you have to manage every detail — such as hiring the music, choosing
the lighting, designing the menu, and picking up trash in the parking lot —
the bar business quickly becomes more work than fun, so don’t be fooled.
In this chapter, we take you on a quick tour of the business. We explore your
reasons for getting into the business and help you check your expectations for
your new venture. We introduce you to what you need to know to understand
and maximize the true financial performance of your new venture. And finally,
we inspire you to keep reaching out to your patrons. Look at the other chap-
ters in this book for more detailed information about these topics and other
important points to know about getting your bar going and keeping it running.
Deciding Whether the Bar Business 
Is Right for You
The bar business world is more than a party every night of the week. It’s
actually a business. Those owners who look at it as a business ultimately
have a much greater chance of succeeding. You can’t just give drinks to
friends or offer drink specials too deep to turn a profit. You can’t order too
many bottles of whiskey only to (not) see two of them walk out the door. You
have a tremendous opportunity to make a great career out of a fun business if
you’re willing to put in the effort and use some common sense.

Why do you want to be 
in the bar business?
The bar business is tough for some people to relate to because you’re selling
an experience rather than something that’s physically packaged that you can
hold. Instead, your product is packaged in many layers, from the music you
play, to your furniture and lighting choices, to the beers you have on draft.
All these things make up your packaging, affect the costs of doing business,
and affect your patron’s decision to hang out at your place or move on down
the street.
Think about these questions when you’re contemplating your decision to
take the plunge and run your own place:
 Do you really like people? An odd question on the surface perhaps, but
running a bar doesn’t afford you a lot of quiet, contemplative alone-time.
Make sure you can stand the onslaught of conversation and complaints.
 How do you handle your own liquor? For some people, running a bar is
like giving a kid the keys to a candy store. The liquor is always available,
and they don’t seem to know when to say “when.”
 Are you a night owl? Think about your own internal clock. When does it
turn on and shut off? If you like to be up until 2 or 3 o’clock in the morn-
ing, this could be the industry for you.
 Are you ready to baby-sit adults? As the owner or manager of the bar,
you have many employees, suppliers, and customers who need your
attention. Sometimes you’re the one who has to cover a missed shift on
the fly. Occasionally, you’ve got to handle a late shipment of liquor that
arrives inconveniently at 6 o’clock on a Friday night. Most likely, you’ll
need to attend to a patron who needs a cab. Whatever the scenario, 
tag — you’re it.
Make sure you spend some time reading Chapter 2 to get a feel for what the
business is really like before you invest serious time and money in develop-
ing your ideas.
What do you expect to 
get out of your place?
Now’s the time for you to sit down and create your plan for what your bar
should be. Early on, create the pie-in-the-sky version of your ideal place,
including a menu (both drink and food), and even draw up mock floor plans.
Figure out where you want your stage and TVs to go, how many bars or wells
you might have, what your theme is going to be, and so on.
10
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Make sure you figure out what you, as a person, want to get out of the occu-
pation of running a bar. Think about these questions:
 How much time do I want to dedicate to work? Running a bar takes a
lot of time, just like managing any other business. The key difference
though is that the time tends to be during nontraditional work times. So
when the rest of the world is out having a good time, you’re providing
the good time.
 How much time do I need to spend with my family? If you like to spend
nights and weekends at home, this may not be the business for you. But
if you’re open to finding other times to enjoy each other, you can make it
work.
 How do I like to spend my free time? If you enjoy talking with people,
listening to music, and playing an occasional game of pool during your
free time, you’ll probably enjoy this work. But remember to draw a clear
line between your business and personal lives.
 Do I like having any free time? When you own your own business, you
don’t have lots of free time in the beginning. If you hire the right staff
members (see Chapter 10 for help) and train them right, you can work
your way into delegating some of your jobs.
Eventually, you must take certain steps to plan your business to make it a
success before you can open the doors and enjoy it. In fact, we recommend
you start planning as soon as you can so you can decide whether your plan is
a viable one.
Create a timeline for getting your business up and running (Chapter 13).
Decide exactly what kind of bar you want to run (Chapter 4). Choose a name
that suits it (Chapter 6). Develop a detailed business plan and use it to find
and secure financing (Chapters 5 and 3, respectively). Find the best location
for your new bar and get the right licenses and permits as soon as you can
(Chapters 6 and 3, respectively).
Starting Fresh or Taking Over 
an Existing Bar?
The decision to open a bar is a big one. Sometimes people are just sort of
considering the idea, and then — out of the blue — they fall in love with an
existing location, immediately imagining themselves behind the bar, spit shin-
ing glasses. Other people build their dream bar in their mind’s eye from the
ground up. They have very specific ideas about every physical detail of their
place. And naturally, they want to physically build it from the ground up, as
well. Depending on your schedule and budget, you can make either scenario
a success if you keep certain things in mind, which we explore in this section.
11
Chapter 1: Bar Business Basics

Location, location, location
The bar business is a bit of a different animal. Location definitely matters as
it does in any business. But what defines a great location is in the mind of the
beholder.
Some people choose to buy or build a bar in an already booming area (and
choose to pay higher rent) to get a leg up on getting people in the door.
Others think it’s better to speculate a bit and get in on the ground floor of an
up-and-coming neighborhood, in the hopes that the area will be the next
“hot” thing. They save on rent, but usually spend more promoting their busi-
ness, and have to wait a while to see a return on their investment. The choice
is yours.
To help you figure out which way to go, and other specifics about finding the
right location for your bar, check out Chapter 6.
Many small neighborhood bars are not in what people would consider ideal
locations, but the people who patronize them love them and wouldn’t think
of going anywhere else. In most cases, these places have been around a long
time. If you’re taking over a location like this, it’s important to figure out
what’s working already. People have sought this place out for a reason, so
you need to figure out what that reason is and don’t mess it up. Don’t just
come in and change everything; instead, meld your ideas with the existing
business to make it work for you.
Don’t alienate your built-in clientele unless you have to, and then make sure
you can replace them with another clientele, through marketing, advertising,
and other means.
Getting in with the right people
We’re not talking about the Celebrity A-List crowd here. Instead, we mean the
barrage of people who can help you alter your space to fit your needs. Most
people starting a new business want to change a few things at their new loca-
tion. Maybe you need to add a wall to create a quiet area away from the
stage. Maybe you need to upgrade the bathrooms to comply with the
Americans With Disabilities Act regulations. Or maybe you need to install a
more comprehensive air-filtration system to keep cigarette smoke away from
your customers.
A contractor can save you lots of time and trouble. Don’t hesitate to ask
questions of a couple of different ones and check their references. Chapter 4
has tips on finding and hiring a contractor.
12
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Here’s a quick list of a few hired helpers to keep on speed dial, depending on
your concept:
 A good equipment-repair technician: Very important, especially if
you’ve purchased used equipment that always needs to be in working
order.
 A plumber who works nights and weekends: Toilets back up even on
busy Saturday nights.
 A handyman: Someone who has restaurant experience is a huge plus.
You never know when you’ll need someone to solder a table leg, replace
a window, or fix a crack in your sidewalk on the fly.
 An electrician: He can help you set up dimmers, hide wires and compo-
nents in places you didn’t know were available, and rig up lighting for
your stage.
Sometimes you get lucky, and someone on your existing staff has some of
these skills. Make use of them. The staffer feels good because you recognize
his or her talent, and you can save the cost of a service call.
Staying on Top of the Latest Bar Trends
To be successful in this or, really, in any business, you need to take care of
your business today, tomorrow, and years from now. One of the best ways to
do this is by staying up on trends in the bar and restaurant businesses.
By watching food and beverage trends across all food service outlets, 
you can
 Find great additions to your food and drink menu. Watch what mixolo-
gists in larger markets are doing for inspiration to create a new cocktail,
for example.
 Consider new categories of food service. If you serve traditional pub
grub, maybe you want to try serving some small plates, or tapas, that
still match your core menu ideas. For more on tapas or other kinds of
food menu items, take a gander at Chapter 9.
 Meld your core concept with what’s hot in the industry. You can keep
your concept fresh while still keeping your core identity. Look for differ-
ent fruits that seem popular with patrons (currently guava and pome-
granate top the list) and incorporate them into your signature cocktail,
for example.
 Get ideas from promotions and marketing ideas that work in other 
markets, and be the first to bring them to your town.
13
Chapter 1: Bar Business Basics

Ultimately, you’re competing directly with all the other bars in your area.
You’re also competing indirectly with local restaurant bars and even carryout
liquor stores nearby. So keeping an eye on what’s going on closer to home 
is essential. You don’t want to copy them and adopt a me-too approach to
innovation, but you want to know what they’re up to. Check out Chapter 16
for details on how to keep up with and stay a step ahead of your local 
competition.
Your liquor sales reps can be a great source of information for you in many
respects. They also call on restaurants, so they can help keep you in the
know about all the goings on around town.
Figuring Out Your Financial 
and Legal Obligations
Owning a bar is an expensive and potentially risky proposition. As with any
new business, you budget your costs, forecast your sales, and hope the sales
exceed the expenses. But, to be successful, you have to do more than just
hope. You need to do your homework and get your detailed plan together
first.
Setting yourself up to succeed
You’ve probably heard “Failing to plan is planning to fail,” and it’s as true in
this business as it is in any other. Successful businesses don’t just happen;
people make them happen. Sure, some people do get lucky, but most can 
only capitalize on that luck if they’re watching their business and actively
managing it.
Here are some tools that can help you keep an eye on your business, evaluate
your successes and failures, and reap the greatest financial rewards:
 A business plan: Hands down, a business plan is the best tool for figur-
ing out how much money you need to get started, and why, when, and
how you’re going to turn a profit. Check out Chapter 5 for the steps to
create your own. (It’s not that painful, we promise.)
 Income statements: An income statement summarizes your expenses and
sales and gives you the bottom-line profit for the month (or the quarter,
year, and so on). Take a look at the sample in Chapter 5 to see what this
looks like. For more details on using it in your business on an ongoing
basis, turn to Chapter 15.
14
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

 Cash flow reports: A cash flow report tells you when money is coming in
and going out of your bar. It shows you exactly when, where, and how
you’re spending (and collecting) all that cold, hard cash. Take a look at
Chapter 15 for help on creating your own version of this exceedingly
helpful tool.
 Inventory counts: Counting your inventory on a regular basis is crucial
to your success. You buy ingredients (like liquor, juice, or even French
fries), turn them into products (like cocktails and food items), and then
sell them to your patrons. Physically counting your inventory and com-
paring it to what you should have (based on your invoices and sales
numbers) tells you how much of your product is actually making it to the
tables and bar top in your bar. It helps you see how much you’re wasting,
or sadly, how much people are stealing from you. Check out Chapter 14
for tips on managing your inventory to maximize your profits.
Hiring other people to help 
you steer the ship
Hire an accountant early in the process of setting up your business. She can
help you get your numbers together for your business plan, which is a must-
do if you’re trying to get financing for your venture. Chapters 3 and 5 can give
you the details. After you’re up and running, you will analyze your monthly
financial reports and look for ways to improve the numbers. A good accoun-
tant, preferably one with restaurant or bar experience, can help. Take a look
at Chapters 14 and 15 to know which numbers to watch and why.
An attorney can help smooth the start-up process by getting all your legal
paperwork in order quickly. He can help you review contracts with suppliers,
establish partnership agreements, file your permits, or maybe incorporate
your business. Depending on how you set up your business, you may need to
draft a partnership agreement or two. Watch for details in Chapter 3.
Insurance is a financial necessity for any business owner. You need protec-
tion in case a water pipe bursts, a fire breaks out, vandals break in, or worst-
case scenario, someone sues you. Make sure you get a good insurance agent
from the beginning. Chapter 4 can help you get the right one for you.
15
Chapter 1: Bar Business Basics

Bringing In the Crowds and 
Keeping Them Coming Back
Getting people in the door is important, and frankly, it’s not terribly difficult.
The hard part is making sure they have a great time, so great, in fact, that
they want to tell their friends and come back night after night, week after
week.
Here are some beginning steps to get you thinking about your long-term
plans for bringing in the crowds:
 Figure out what’s truly special and unique about your bar. Write it all
down, even if you never show it to anyone else. Take a look at Chapter 4
for help.
 Decide who your customers are. Are you interested in drawing a college
crowd or after-work yuppies? Do you want sports fans or music lovers?
 Figure out what kinds of things attract them. Maybe it’s free stuff (like
key chains and magnets with your bar’s name on them), or maybe it’s
live music or all football, all day. Check out Chapter 6 for more entertain-
ment options.
 Look at ways to communicate that your bar matches your customers’
wants. Connect with your customers where they are. Maybe it’s in the
college newspaper or on a banner in the subway or on the back of a
ticket stub from the local baseball team. The possibilities are endless,
but you have to get creative to get noticed. See Chapter 16 for more
ideas.

Chapter 2
Understanding What It Takes 
to Own and Operate a Bar
In This Chapter
 Figuring out why (and whether) you really want to do this
 Debunking the myth of inevitable failure
 Getting a handle on the time involved in running a bar
 Deciding whether you have what it takes
A
bar is a place to celebrate, relax, and have fun with friends . . . for the
patrons. You, on the other hand, work in this place. While it’s definitely
fun, it has a serious side. You have to be responsible for everything and
everyone in the joint. You have to make sure everything’s going smoothly,
patrons are happy, and the laws related to running your business are fol-
lowed to the letter.
In this chapter, we help you get a handle on the reality (not the scripted,
“reality TV” version) of what it’s like to run a bar. We help you get a sense of
the time commitments, the financial obligations, and the sacrifices you make
as a bar owner. We also help you sort out your own motivations and expecta-
tions to make sure you’re going into the business with your eyes wide open.
Social Skills 101: Do You Really 
Like People (And Their Problems)?
To succeed in the bar business, you have to be accepting of lots of personali-
ties, schedules, and priorities that aren’t yours. Whether you’re dealing with
customers, employees, or a sales rep trying to place the latest in a long line
of apple vodkas in your bar, you have to develop a thick skin if you don’t
have one already.

Patrons are convinced you added too many beers to their tab. Another group
knows they were next in line for a pub table. Someone else thinks you’re
watering down the drinks. All headaches that you have to handle with a
smile, or risk losing your clientele.
Employees often have jobs in addition to the one at your bar. Or they may be
just working for you temporarily, between “real jobs,” or between school
years. Although bar employees know they need to be at work to get paid,
they tend to be very socially active. So you’ll have to balance schedule
requests, last-minute call-offs from employees who had too much fun the
night before, and workers who completely drop off the face of the earth. The
bottom line is that, many times, this job isn’t an employee’s first (or second
or third) priority, and you’ll need to find a way to deal with it.
You are in the people business. You have to compete for clients and employ-
ees. Accommodate them, but don’t let either group walk all over you.
Considering your motivation
Why do you want to be in this business? It’s not a rhetorical question, or at
least it shouldn’t be. You should know the answer, even if you don’t share it
with us. Seriously consider the question and write down the answer.
There are lots of great reasons to want to run a bar. Here are a few of our
favorites:
 You love a fast-paced, dynamic work environment.
 You love taking on a challenge.
 You’re passionate for mixology.
 You love tending bar and want to make an investment in your financial
future.
 You have a passion for spirits, beers, and liquor.
 You’re continuing the family tradition.
And the following list contains a few reasons that should send up a red flag in
your mind:
 You think it will be fun.
 You want a place to hang out.
18
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

 You’re tired of having a “real” job.
 You spend most of your time in bars, so you may as well get paid for it.
 You want to kick back and take it easy.
If one or more of these reasons sounds familiar, don’t be completely discour-
aged. Just make sure that motivations such as these aren’t your only, or even
your primary, reasons for wanting to get into the business. And do some fur-
ther investigation before making the financial, personal, and professional
commitment to the business. (See the “Checking your expectations” section
for some hints.)
Mastering the key traits of 
a successful bar owner
Every bar owner injects her own personality into her place. In fact, many
people start their own bar because they want it to be different from other
places nearby. But most successful bar owners have certain qualities in
common. We cover some of these points in more detail later in the chapter,
but for now, this list gives you the inside story:
 Business savvy: Despite people partying it up in your bar, it’s not a con-
stant party for you, the bar owner; it’s a business. In fact, if more people
looked at bars (and restaurants for that matter) as a business, they’d
probably have more success. Skills that you’ve learned, developed, and
honed in the “real world” can apply to the bar business, like buying skill-
fully, managing tactfully, and negotiating shrewdly.
Set up your controls and systems for purchasing, cleaning, scheduling,
training (and all the other -ing words you need to run your business)
before you open your doors. Consider the long-term consequences of
your decisions before it’s too late to make the right choice. Learn from
your mistakes and build on your success, just like you would in any
business.
 High energy: Owning a bar means lots of long hours on your feet.
Employees take their cue for how to deal with the physical stressors 
of working in a bar from you, their fearless leader. Show them (rather
than tell them) how to keep their energy up and keep the personality
“on” at all times during their shift. Your bar can’t have a positive vibe 
if you don’t.
19
Chapter 2: Understanding What It Takes to Own and Operate a Bar

As a manager or owner, one of your jobs is to promote a positive atti-
tude and energy in the restaurant. You can have positive interactions
with customers all day long and make a difference. But if you extend
those positive vibes to include exchanges between you and your staff,
your staff can in turn extend the good vibes to your customers. That’s
your goal, because the positive energy can quickly transfer to your clien-
tele as well. If you like to have fun, but you’re serious about doing the
job right, it shows. And it translates into success.
 Ability to hold your own liquor, or just say no to it: For some people,
managing a bar is like getting the keys to the grown-up candy store, and
the temptation is too much to resist. As a barkeep, you often drink as
part of your job. Whether you’re tasting a new line of flavored rums,
checking a freshly tapped keg, sampling a “bad” bottle of wine, or joining
your regular customer with a glass of wine or a beer close to closing
time, in the course of your daily job you may have occasion to drink. No
matter what the circumstances, you still have to count the money at the
end of the night. Or you have to be ready to go first thing in the morning.
 Trust: You need to be able to trust and depend on other people if you
want to run a bar. You can’t be there all the time that you’re open, and if
you are, you’re going to grow old quickly in an industry that already
wears down the best of us. Surround yourself with people who you trust
and who you think are smarter than you. Easier said than done, but the
successful people in the industry are successful at doing just that.
 Flexibility: Achieving success and maintaining success are two very dif-
ferent things. As a bar owner, you should be constantly looking at ways
to increase your business and keep your clientele interested in your bar,
your atmosphere, and your beverages. You have to be in the know about
what the other bars are doing and be willing to change your own game
plan as necessary.
Look to your liquor reps to help educate you, your staff, and your cus-
tomers about new products on the market. Try out different entertain-
ment options on different nights of the week to appeal to different
groups of people. Run food specials to see what kinds of stuff intrigue
your patrons. See Chapter 16 for more ideas about marketing your bar.
Checking your expectations
Running a bar, either yours or someone else’s, is a huge commitment. It
requires long hours, constant vigilance, and the ability to control potentially
chaotic situations — on a daily basis.
20
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Take out a pen and some paper. Divide the paper into two columns. In the
first, list all of your expectations for the future of your bar and your career.
List everything you can think of, big and small, specific and general, that
maps in some way to your career in your bar. Consider what you picture your
family life like, goals for the bar, general sales figures, and profit numbers,
everything you can think of. This is your chance to put your dreams on
paper. Then, in the second column, write down what you expect out of your-
self to make this happen. Take into account your contribution in terms of
time and money, any sacrifices you’ll have to make, and anything else that
you can think of.
Figure out how realistic your expectations are. Talk to your business partners
to see whether their ideas mesh with yours. Show this list to your significant
other, and make sure you’re both on the same page about goals and sacrifices
the family may make for the business to succeed and vice versa. There’s no
right or wrong answer. It’s all a matter of articulating your ideas, sharing them
with the appropriate people, and following through on your commitments.
To get an even better understanding of what your days and nights will be like:
Your day will be solving problems. Training and retaining employees. Reading
all the newspapers from your area to keep up with the sports and world
events because that’s what you will talk about all day. You must keep your
patience intact. Patience is your greatest asset. You will be dealing with
people all day, and they change every day. Ray’s old friend used to say,
“People are all the same, just different faces and stories.” You must love
people to stay in this business. You will have fun and learn a lot every day if
you keep your ship on course.
Staying on the Positive Side 
of the Success–Failure Rate
Several different reputable organizations (including top-rated restaurant and
hospitality schools at Cornell and Michigan State universities) recently con-
ducted case studies to test the “common knowledge” that “90 percent of
restaurants fail in the first year.” The data (which takes into account eating and
drinking places, including bars) indicates that the first-year failure rate is some-
where between 25 and 30 percent. After ten years, around 70 percent have
failed. So, success is far from guaranteed, but it’s certainly not impossible.
Failure and attrition is natural in this business, as it is in any industry. New
businesses fail and others take their place. That’s the beauty and the harsh
reality of the world.
21
Chapter 2: Understanding What It Takes to Own and Operate a Bar

Why do so many fail?
Ultimately, most bars fail because they aren’t run properly. Sure, we can think
of many examples of bars that didn’t make it because they had a landlord dis-
pute or some other unforeseen circumstance they couldn’t overcome, but
most fail because of poor management.
The most common reasons for failure are
 Irreconcilable differences among the owners. Set up your partnership
agreements the right way using Chapter 3 as your guide.
 Initial underfunding of the bar. Check out Chapter 3 to avoid this 
problem.
 Overstocking inventory. Take a peek at Chapters 8 and 14 to head this
problem off.
 Ignoring or mismanaging cash flow (and ebbs). Chapter 15 gives you
tools to manage yours.
 Failing to pay appropriate taxes on time. Read Chapter 3 for tax informa-
tion, and get an accountant you trust.
 Skimming, stealing, or other illegal activity. Chapter 14 is required read-
ing to help you keep what’s yours.
 Death by a thousand cuts. Some owners choose to cut corners in food
quality, quantity, cleaning regimens, innovation, and so on over time.
Over the course of, say, a year, the bar morphs into a mere shadow of its
former self. Along the way, it alienates its clientele, who spread the bad
news, leaving the bar without repeat business and with disappointed
patrons.
Lucky you, you bought this book, so you’re more likely to make it into the
success category already.
Figuring out why others succeed
Most successful bar owners succeed through sheer force of will, with a dash
of common sense, and business savvy to match. They manage their bars as
businesses, with procedures and systems. They watch the bottom line and
actively train their employees to provide excellent service. They purchase
their materials properly and price their menus accordingly. They keep their
bars clean and their patrons happy. In short, they have stayed objective and
balanced their business goals with their mission to help people have fun.

Understanding the Financial
Ramifications
We definitely don’t want to discourage you from getting into this exciting 
and rewarding industry. But for you to succeed, you need to have realistic
expectations of the financial commitment and ramifications of running your
own bar.
Definitely check out Chapter 3 for more details on getting funding for your
business.
Preparing yourself for personal guarantees
Financing is tough for new bar owners. Leasing some equipment is possible
(take a look at Chapter 7 for our tips on what to lease). Assuming someone
like a bank agrees to give you money, you will probably have to personally
guarantee to secure the loan.
A personal guarantee is a pledge that you personally (rather than your bar or
the corporation that operates your bar) are responsible for the loan, even if
the bar defaults on the loan. So, the bank may be loaning the money to the
bar, but it expects to get its money from you if the bar goes out of business.
(And the bank will want its money. Read the next section for more about what
could happen if your bar goes belly up.)
This isn’t always the case, however. In fact, with competition between ven-
dors today, you can get away without signing any personal guarantees at all.
The vendors may give you shorter terms on repayment, but the guarantee
should be a bargaining point rather than a given.
Because banks consider a bar to be a risky financial investment, many banks
will not loan you money. Those banks that will loan you money may require
you to guarantee the loan. Again, this isn’t always the case. It’s a bargaining
point for a percent interest you pay the bank. Banks often need to be “edu-
cated” on the true risk of a bar and their failure rates. Eating and drinking
establishments have been cornerstones of the U.S. economy for decades, 
and there are as many success stories as there are failures. Show the bank
the successes and how you plan to be one, too!
23
Chapter 2: Understanding What It Takes to Own and Operate a Bar

Accepting the worst-case scenario
We hope that you have more business than you know what to do with. We
hope you have a fat bank account with more operating capital than you need.
We wish nothing but success for you in your bar. But, because this book is all
about the real deal of the business, we discuss the downside of what may
happen if the world doesn’t beat a path to your door. Or if you hit a dry
season. Or if your suppliers cut you off . . .
You will be put on COD (cash on delivery) as your first warning. Suppliers
will only give you goods if you pay in cash; getting inventory on credit will be
a thing of the past.
Always have two or three suppliers as backups. You may only have hit a bad
season for the area. If you’re overextended with one supplier, you can keep
your doors open by purchasing your goods from one of your backups until
you set things right with your primary supplier. This solution isn’t a long-
term one, though; straighten out the course as soon as you can.
Here are a few warning signs of hard times to come:
 Nights that should be busy (like Fridays and Saturdays for most areas)
are really slow.
 Your help is quitting. It can happen like rats fleeing a sinking ship.
 The neighborhood is changing. If you see businesses boarding up, van-
dalism and crime are sure to follow.
 You’re three months behind in your bills, and you’re on COD with 
everyone.
 You feel it in your gut that it’s time to sell.
It’s a great idea to sell while you’re still open; you get more money when your
business is up and running than when your doors are shut. Talk it out with
your family and close friends. It’s better to have loved and lost than never to
have loved at all. Take a break and try again!
As soon as you see the warning signs, begin taking steps to turn things
around. One logical place to start cutting expenses is labor dollars. (Take a
look at Chapter 15 for more details.) So, if you send people home early to
reduce payroll, you have to start working more to make up for their hours.
And remember to watch all your costs from the start. Be careful of any extra
benefits you offer because you may have to take them back if business slows
down. Taking benefits away tells your employees that something is wrong, and
they will jump ship. (If they don’t jump ship, they’ll be mighty unhappy — and
that’s bad for business, too.)
24
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Word travels fast in the bar business, so watch what you say. Do not let
anyone know when things get tough; it will make matters worse. It will be
hard to hire new employees and hard to attract new customers. Your bar is a
business, and you need to run it like one. Plan wisely from the day you set
your plan in motion.
Personal bankruptcy is a very real possibility if your business fails. Make sure
you work with your accountant to protect as many of your assets as possible.
You may be able to keep your family’s home.
Looking at the upside
If you work hard and plan carefully, your bar will be a superb success, and
you will have great fun and a good life. You will be financially stable, and
everyone will know your name. You will be asked for advice and also be
invited to a lot of parties. Your popularity will increase 30 times what it 
is now.
You will have tons of friends (maybe because of the free drinks you buy). Our
advice is to make sure you take time off from the beginning, even closing one
day a week (we suggest Monday). Take time to be with your family. You will
have more invitations to events than you can possibly attend. Our advice: Go!
Take your better half, your best friend, your mom. We give you more pointers
about spending time with friends and family later in the chapter, but for now,
remember that all work and no play makes for a terrible life. Enjoy!
Balancing Your Bar Life 
with Your Personal Life
If you’ve ever worked in a bar (and we really hope you have if you’re now
considering running your own place), you know that those who run the bar
are there well before and after the hours of operation. If the bar is open from
11 a.m. to 2 a.m. for example, someone is probably there between 8 a.m. and
3 a.m. at a minimum, 19 hours a day. That’s the best-case scenario. If a pipe
bursts, a cooler breaks down, or a toilet backs up, the day gets significantly
longer, instantly. So naturally, as the owner of the bar, you’re the one who has
to deal with all these unforeseen events no matter what time of the day or
night. And remember, that’s on top of running the everyday, normal stuff of
the bar.
25
Chapter 2: Understanding What It Takes to Own and Operate a Bar

All the while, your family’s and friends’ lives go on. Birthdays happen.
Holidays occur. School plays go on whether or not the bar is open. You have
to balance the demands of a crazy work schedule with your personal life if
you want to be part of both. In this section, we help you get the best of both
worlds.
If you’re an owner or manager, you will work 70 to 80 hours a week, maybe
more when you’re getting your bar up and running. Many small-business
owners work just as much. The biggest challenge is typically not how much
you work, but when you work.
Combining your professional 
and social lives
The bar business is fun. Let’s face it — that’s why most of us are drawn to it
in the first place. When you hire your employees, you probably will hire
people you are drawn to. You won’t hire people who repel you, anyway. If
they’re quality bar employees, they likely are drawn toward the lively atmos-
phere offered by the bar and may even enjoy a drink now and then. Because
you already have personalities and interests in common, you will on occasion
have a drink with the people you work with and those who work for you. It’s
inevitable.
You have just blended your professional life with your social life. To success-
fully navigate this potential minefield, you have to drink in moderation and
keep your wits about you at all times.
Two common pitfalls await bar owners who hang out and party with people
who work with or for them: overindulgence in alcohol and inappropriate 
personal relationships.
Overindulging in alcohol can lead to embarrassing behavior, like inappropri-
ate sexual advances, drunken tirades, passing out, slurring your words, and
so on. As the manager or owner of the bar, you need to maintain your credi-
bility with your staff at all times. An occasional slip in your demeanor while
under the influence may be forgiven, but a pattern of overindulging will lead
to morale problems, blurring the line between manager and employee.
If you don’t know when to say “when,” you should probably find another
career.
26
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Having personal relationships with your employees can lead to very close
relationships — too close, in fact, if the relationships become romantic or
sexual. It’s not unheard of for people to meet while working in a bar, then
marry, and lead happy lives together. But if the relationship doesn’t end well
(and most don’t), it becomes a strain on everyone in the bar, not just the two
people in the relationship.
Be very careful in getting too close or too friendly with your employees. If
you are known for dating employees, you may be opening yourself up to
accusations of sexual harassment. We recommend you date and fraternize
with people other than your employees.
It’s also inevitable that at some point your friends will come into your place,
and you’ll sit down and have a drink with them toward the end of the night.
But remember, only sit down at the end of the night; everyone will ask you to
sit down and have a drink. A simple answer is: “Not right now, maybe later,
but thank you.” You can sit down for a moment, but you cannot drink with
everyone because you must stay sober and keep your wits about you.
Remember, you have money to count, employees to manage, patrons to
supervise. It’s much tougher to cut someone off when they see you drinking
yourself.
For safety reasons, consider requiring the closing manager to refrain from
drinking. In the bar business, you have significant amounts of cash to count
and account for. Math can be tough after a few beers, and impaired people
are easier to rob than sober ones.
Celebrating holidays, birthdays, and other
special times with family and friends
The toughest thing about maintaining your relationships in this business is
balancing your work schedule with all the special events that take place in
your life. When people are celebrating, they often look to you to entertain
them, host them, and generally make sure they’re having a good time. So, if
you’re helping your patrons celebrate, how’s your own family celebrating?
Finding ways to celebrate special occasions isn’t impossible in the bar 
business. Here are a few ways that we’ve found help us immensely:
 Communicate with your family and friends. Understand their expecta-
tions and share yours with them.
 Keep a master calendar posted for everyone to see. Write down every-
thing you can so everyone knows who is where, when, and why.
27
Chapter 2: Understanding What It Takes to Own and Operate a Bar

 When you’re with your family, be with your family. Be fully present,
mind, body, and soul. If you’re distracted thinking about your business,
you may as well just go to the bar.
 Schedule your own family celebrations before or after the traditional
date to work around your work schedule. If your partner’s birthday
falls on Super Bowl Sunday (and your bar is slamming busy, so you can’t
be gone), take her out for a special dinner ahead of time to celebrate her
special day.
Okay, we aren’t completely delusional. Of course, these things are much
easier said than done. But with commitment and consistency, you can make
your personal life a priority and have a successful business.
The winter holidays, especially between Thanksgiving Day and New Year’s
Day, are incredibly hectic in the bar business. Everyone is celebrating, often
many nights a week, so you are working. It’s not entirely unusual, especially
as the owner or manager of the bar, to have just a single day off, or maybe
two, during this time. During peak times, it’s tough to take time away from
what could be an extremely profitable sales period to attend special events 
in your own family’s life.
Getting support from your family
The support of your family is important in any business. But in the bar busi-
ness, it’s essential. Ultimately, you’re choosing a profession that takes you
away from your family many hours a week, often at special times in their
lives, like holidays. You also change your definition of normal when it comes
to spending time with your family and friends. Instead of being off on
Saturdays like normal people, for example, you may regularly be off on
Mondays. If you have a family or are considering starting one, make sure your
partner understands the ramification that your career choice may have on
your family life.
The right approach can make all the difference. You can shift family days
around and create your own “regular” schedule. Also, you have the benefit 
of not having to be at a regular job early in the day. If you have kids, you can
spend mornings before day care or school with them and help them start
their day because you won’t be there to tuck them in for the night.
Like all parents who work outside their homes, you have to make choices
about how much time you spend with your kids. You can make family life
work, no matter what industry you’re in, if it’s a priority for you.
28
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

Think about nontraditional times you can spend with your kids, no matter
what age they are. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
 If you’re working night shifts, consider stopping by school to have lunch
with your children because you may not be home for dinner.
 Take a dinner break, if possible, a couple nights a week and run home to
see your family.
 Spend extra time in the morning with the kids before you take them to
day care.
 Volunteer to coach or be a scout leader on your day off to schedule reg-
ular time with your kids.
Above all, be proactive in coming up with solutions to the inevitable schedule
conflicts that come up. Don’t just expect your partner to solve all the family
problems and conflicts. Showing concern and taking responsibility goes a
long way in alleviating the stress that being involved in the bar business
eventually brings.
Take time off when you can. Your family will appreciate it. And your business
will ultimately benefit from a more rested, objective owner.
What if you really need a vacation?
Everyone needs some time away now and then, no matter what business
they’re in. The best way you can make sure that happens is to put efficient
systems in place and train your employees to run things effectively. Giving
employees all the information and training they need gives them the confi-
dence to run your business the way you want it to be run.
You also need to find people you trust whom you can lean on for help.
Generally, employees want experience and responsibility, so if you give them
duties to help make the place run better and so you can go on vacation, you’ll
end up helping each other out.
Tell your manager where you will be and call once and give the manager a
phone number where you can be reached. Tell your manager, “If there is any
problem you cannot solve, please call me.” In most cases, you will not be
bothered once.
29

You won’t be able to solve any serious problem over the phone. Take a vaca-
tion, you need it. And if you get a lot of calls . . . you need a new manager.

ing procedures, and cash handling to get your bar into top shape and keep it

Minding the Money and the Law
In This Chapter
 Figuring how much money you need
 Considering places to get financing
 Looking at paperwork and legal requirements
B
ars and taverns are as welcome as asbestos plants in some towns. If bars
aren’t run properly, especially when monitoring their customers’ alcohol
consumption, crime can ensue. Intoxicated patrons can get into fights in the
parking lot, get into trouble walking home, or injure themselves or someone
else in a car accident. Conversely, your patrons could become victims of mug-
gers looking for an easy target. Because of the potential for problems, most
municipalities require extensive paperwork to make sure that people who are
licensed to serve liquor do so responsibly. As a result, navigating your way
through the paperwork to set up your new business is a challenge, even when
everything goes well.
In this chapter, we help you determine how much money you actually need 
to get up and running, and where to get it. We explain what professionals you
may need to help you dot your i’s and cross your t’s. We also help you navi-
gate the head-spinning world of legalese associated with starting your own
business, getting a liquor license, and opening your doors. And we introduce
you to your local health inspector.
Figuring Out Your Start-up Costs
Starting a bar is not cheap. Whether you’re taking over an existing bar or
building your own from scratch, you need money before you can make
money. Many expenses happen only once as you start your venture. You 
have to purchase items like bar stools, soda guns, and bar wells before you
can open your doors and collect that first dollar. Your costs for getting a bar

started vary based on the location you choose, the modifications you make,
your construction costs, the glassware you pick out, the size of your location,
and so on. As much as we’d like to give you an idea of how much you actually
need to get started, your actual costs vary wildly based on what kind of bar
you want to run and where you want to run it.
Chapter 5 contains detailed information on setting up your business plan, but
for now we’re just going to give you an idea of what kind of costs to expect.
Table 3-1 can help you get started. Make lists of all the items you need and
how much you expect them to cost, and then consolidate your list on the
worksheet. So under furniture and décor, include the cost of your bar stools,
tables, chairs, outdoor seating, any furniture in the break room or your office,
and so on.

Don’t forget: You don’t stop needing money the day you open your doors.
When you’re planning for the amount of money you need to get started, plan
to include at least three months’ worth of operating expenses. This cushion,
called an operating reserve, helps you stay open until your business level
picks up.
Failing to have an adequate operating reserve is the failure of many bars and
restaurants early in their life span. Don’t become a casualty because you fail
to have enough in reserve.
Financing Your New Business
Every deal and sale is different. If you’re buying an existing bar, most bar
owners will want money upfront, usually from 20 to 50 percent down. That
means cash! You will have to borrow the rest. Maybe the owner will finance
the remaining balance by taking back a small second mortgage or loan with 
a good interest rate. Ask!
This section is not on following the money; it’s on finding the money. For
more info on finding financing, check out Small Business For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Eric Tyson and Jim Schell (Wiley).
Finding money takes time, a good reputation, and a great business plan (see
Chapter 5). These factors can make the difference between getting the money
and not.
Contacting a bank
Few, if any, banks lend people money to open a bar. They lend money on real
estate, but very few will lend money for a liquor license. Talk to a loan officer
at your local bank or where you keep your savings or checking accounts. It
won’t hurt, and he may give you a few leads.
When you apply for a loan, you’ll be asked to fill out an application and pro-
vide details about your financial background. Here’s the information — some
of which you’ll have to supply — that your bank will use to decide whether to
lend you money:
 Proof of your ability to repay the loan: Show them in detail how you
plan to make money, including a timeline with projected sales and
expenses. Use your business plan to get this point across. For details 
on creating your own business plan, check out Chapter 5.

Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

 Your personal credit history: The bank runs your personal credit report
and assigns you a credit rating. If you want to know what the bank is
going to find when it looks at your credit history, you can request a free
copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com
or calling 1-877-322-8228.
 Equity: Equity is the value of a piece of property or a business after you
subtract the mortgage or other loans owed on it. It usually takes the
form of your investment in the company. It’s sort of like a down payment
on a house.
 Collateral: Any asset that you can use as security, such as your house,
your car, and certain kinds of investments, such as certificates of
deposit, may count as collateral, something the bank will collect if 
you default on your loan.
 Experience: Make sure that your business plan includes details of 
your work and management experience in the business.
Beg, borrow, or sweat: Finding partners
When all else fails, you may have to give part of your dream away by taking
on a partner (or two). A partner is an investor in your company who owns
part of the company and assists in running it.
You have to decide whether it’s worth it to you to share your dream to make
it come true. Having a partner is like getting married. You must love (or at
least like), trust, and respect each other, and be willing to compromise. If you
can get away without having a partner, go for it!
If you can’t stand the thought of sharing power and want to run your bar
your way but still need financial backing, you can always find a couple of
silent partners (investors who only supply money and have little say in the
operations). When you pay investors back, they go away!
Potential business-partner candidates
If you decide you need to take on a partner, here are some places to start
looking:
 Consider looking to your family. Maybe Mom, Dad, Grandma, Granddad,
sisters, brothers, or your rich Uncle Walter (don’t we all have one?) will
be willing to back your business.
Adding the stress of borrowed money to already complicated relation-
ships can be a recipe for disaster. Make sure you’re ready for the conse-
quences of getting involved in business with your family. You don’t want
to lose their support during what’s sure to be a tense time in your life.

Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry 

 Look to friends with knowledge and interest in the industry. If you’ve
worked with them before, you may already know their philosophies and
work ethic. If they match your own, you could do well together.
 Consider a former employer. If you have a great working relationship
with a bar owner you worked for, he may be interested in helping you
get started with your own place.
Too many partners lead to too many bosses and, inevitably, to failure! Five
partners often means they bring five spouses, and now you have ten opinions
and suggestions. It could get tough.
Establishing terms you can live with
Most people make investments to gain a return on their investment: They
expect your business to make money. You must set up a written agreement
for when and how your investors will recoup their investment with you.
There’s no right or wrong way to pay back every investor. Most people have
specific things they’ll want. Both sides have to compromise to reach an
agreement you can both live with. And the sooner you pay them back, the
sooner you get to keep all the financial rewards and lose the headache of
answering to partners.
Here are some things to consider when you’re figuring out how you want to
structure your arrangements:
 What rights do partners have? You should figure out who’s responsible
for what tasks or areas of the restaurant, who makes which decisions,
and who reports to whom.
 Who owns how much? Make sure you identify who owns how much, no
matter what the contribution, including money, time, or both. Spell out
the details of your arrangement clearly so that no one has any confusion.
 Who gets a salary? Spell out who gets a salary and when it starts. Often,
as you’re building a business, the owners take a small salary (or some-
times no salary) until the business has the money to spare. Make sure
that you resolve all financial issues clearly and to the satisfaction of all
parties involved.
 How long will it take to repay any loans? Create a written plan to
return loans to investors. Be sure to include details about any interest
they’re entitled to.
 Which partners are silent? Everyone has an opinion, and you must 
clarify how your decisions will ultimately get made. Your first line of
defense is to discuss, persuade, and then compromise. But the occasion
will arise that requires one person’s opinion to win the day. Write down
who has final say in these situations before you start your business.
35
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

 What happens if someone wants to get out or someone dies? Make
sure that you have an exit procedure outlined in your agreement.
Usually, one partner can buy the other out, either in a lump-sum 
payment (all the cash handed over at once) or over time.
Do not give the place away when looking for partners. Create relationships
you can live with.
Make sure your lawyer reads every sentence in all agreements, and make
sure you know what you’re signing. Don’t let your dream become a nightmare
by agreeing to terms and conditions you can’t live with.
Familiarizing Yourself with Liquor and
Zoning Laws, and Other Legalities
Check with your local town or city hall about all the laws and requirements
before you buy a bar. If you find out something that causes you to change your
mind about operating a bar, you don’t have to go forward with your plans. The
police, building inspector, health inspector, and every other inspector in town
will tell you the hours and days you can be open and what you can and cannot
have in your place. Some towns won’t let you open unless you serve food. You
won’t be able to operate near a school or church (you have to be so many feet
from both). Most areas have very specific requirements and regulations; you
may even run into a blue law, which prohibits certain businesses from opening
on Sundays. They still exist in some states!
Make sure to ask the following questions:
 What kind of liquor license do I need? What’s the fee? How often do I
renew it?
 What are the restrictions on my hours of operation?
 Can I serve food? Do I have to serve food?
 Can I open on Sundays? What time?
 Do I need a license for music? What’s the fee?
 Do I need a license for food? What’s the fee?
 Where do I display the license?
 What are the grounds for revocation?
36
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry 

 How many licenses are issued in the town?
 What areas of town are off limits for my business?
 What are the smoking laws I must abide by?
Obtaining a liquor license
Every bar that serves liquor must have a license to do so. Different agencies
regulate the process in different states. Check out Appendix A to find the
agency in your state. Make sure you start the process of getting your license
early in the timeline of starting up your bar. Depending on the system in your
area, getting this license could take a year or more.
The cost of a liquor license varies greatly. The application fee and taxes
involved may be only a few hundred dollars. But because many communities
limit the number of liquor licenses, you may need to buy one from an existing
bar (like the one you’re taking over perhaps) or even a license broker, which
can wind up costing thousands of dollars. When buying and transferring 
a liquor license, make sure you have a lawyer who has gone through the
process (see the “Bringing In the Big Three: Accountants, Insurance Agents,
and Attorneys” section later in this chapter), and ask questions until you
understand everything.
Sometimes a town will issue a new license when the population increases. 
Go to the town government to find out whether you can acquire a license 
this way and, if so, find out the bidding process. These licenses are usually
awarded on a blind bidding scale, sold to the highest bidder. Again, consult
with an attorney to walk you through the process.
Most licenses are valid for a year and require an initial license fee. If you
maintain good standing with your local agency, you can probably get an auto-
matic renewal for a smaller annual renewal fee. If, however, someone has filed
complaints against you for overserving patrons alcoholic beverages, serving
minors, or violating other terms of the license, your license may be revoked.
Considering the classes of licenses
Your local governing agency offers liquor licenses in different classes. What
kind of establishment you have determines what kind of license you need and
how much you pay for it. The class of license you need depends completely
on what you serve, where you serve it, how you serve it, and whom you
serve it to. If you need help deciding what kind of bar you want to run, take 
a look at Chapter 4.
37
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

Here’s a list of the broad, common classes of licenses used in many areas.
They may be called something different in your area.
 Tavern: Some states require taverns to offer a food menu, but others
don’t. If you serve food but half of your sales are alcohol, your state 
government may require you to apply for a tavern license. In some
states, no such separate license exists.
 Beer and wine: This license allows you to serve only beer and wine.
Licensees cannot sell liquor or distilled spirits. In some areas, smaller
restaurants (40 to 100 seats) can get only this type of license.
 Restaurant: This license usually requires that only a certain percentage
of your sales come from alcohol. States have varying percentages, but
most requirements fall somewhere around 40 percent. Some states have
a minimum number of seats required for your establishment to qualify
for this license. A restaurant license usually allows you to serve beer,
wine, and liquor. Some people call it an all-liquor license for that reason.
 Club: Private clubs, such as country clubs, golf clubs, and so on, are 
eligible for a separate license allowing them to serve alcohol to their
members. Some states only allow beer and wine in clubs, but others
allow for all liquor.
In certain counties, local governments mandate that alcohol may not be
sold within its borders. These counties are known as dry counties. Most
dry counties include an exemption for private clubs, so some creative
owners get club licenses and then create a not-terribly-exclusive policy,
selling membership cards to their patrons ($1 for a lifetime membership,
for example), so they can then sell them cocktails.
 Brewpub: Many places brew their own beer, and in some states, you
need a separate license to serve it to the public. Check your local
agency for details.
Some states issue an alternating premises, or AP, liquor license for places
like wineries and breweries that allows these establishments to brew
and ferment alcohol at certain times and serve patrons at other times.
 Eating place: This license is usually reserved for carryout places, such
as delis, that may serve food but offer a small amount of carryout beer.
Usually, you can only sell beer with this license, and you are restricted in
the amount you can sell to each customer (one six-pack per customer,
for example).
 Retail: A retail license applies to grocery stores, drugstores, liquor
stores, or any other retail establishments that sell bottles of liquor.
Some states offer a few other classes that we don’t cover in detail here, such
as hotel and restaurant, bed and breakfast, arts (for places like theaters that
sell alcohol during intermission), and wholesale (for companies that sell
liquor to bars and restaurants).

Applying for a new liquor license
Make sure you allow plenty of time to go through this process. The timeline
and process vary depending on where you’re bar is located, so check with
your local office. And remember, allow yourself plenty of time to get this
done. Without a liquor license, you can’t serve liquor. And if you can’t serve
liquor, you can’t run a bar.
Here are the general steps to follow when you’re getting your liquor license:
1. Figure out which government agency issues licenses in your area.
Turn to Appendix A for a state-by-state listing. If for some reason this
information isn’t correct for your area, conduct an Internet search,
check with other bars, or get out the local phone book.
2. Research the classes of licenses in your area.
Request a list from your local agency. Many agencies post descriptions
on their Web sites.
At some point, you will need to talk to a real live person about this.
Many agency Web sites are woefully out of date, so don’t rely on them
for the ultimate answer.
3. Figure out which class works for your business.
Based on what you find out, look at your business, your projected food-
to-beverage sales, and the like to determine which license you’ll likely
need. (Your business plan you draw up in Chapter 5 can help you esti-
mate your sales.) Work with your attorney to make sure that you under-
stand the details.
You don’t get a choice of which class of license you need, per se. Rather,
you put together all the information with the appropriate application
forms, and the agency hands down a decision. It’s not exactly like when
you take your vehicle title in and they tell you which class of license
plates (tractor-trailer, truck, car, and so on) you need. It’s more of a
process than that. Nuances and seemingly minor details can sometimes
make the difference in how much you pay for your license.
4. Contact the local agency to find out the availability of licenses, costs,
the application process, and a timeline for getting the whole process
completed.
Your attorney may be able to handle this step for you, but make sure it
gets done.
39
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

5. Update your business plan with the information on the cost and 
timeline.
Make sure that you’ve budgeted both the time and money to get your
license before you open your bar. This step is essential, whether you’re
using your own money or have partners, because if you don’t get it
done, you can’t sell liquor without a license. Revise your plan anytime
you run into a new schedule or budget factor.
6. Apply for the new license or for the transfer of the soon-to-be 
purchased license.
Again, this process varies from state to state, so make sure you 
complete Step 4 thoroughly so you know what to do.
In addition to your attorney, you might consider using a consulting company
that specializes in obtaining liquor licenses. These companies can help you
streamline your applications. They file your paperwork and the like — for a
fee, of course.
Before you agree to work with any third party to secure a license, check with
the state agency that issues licenses and your own attorney. You may be able
to avoid additional fees and charges just by making a couple of phone calls.
Your local agency may have a list of recommended brokers who handle the
buying or selling of existing licenses.
Understanding why you must know your liquor laws upfront
Most areas have very specific liquor laws. The government specifies when,
where, in what container, in what quantity, and sometimes even at what price
a bar, restaurant, or club can serve alcohol to its customers. These laws can
affect how you run your business, like the equipment you must use, the
extent of your food menu, and your hours of operations. If you don’t follow
the law, you risk paying fines, getting sued, facing criminal charges, or losing
your bar.
Here are some specifics that may apply to your business. Be sure to check
with your governing agency (a list is included in Appendix A) for details.
 No discounts: You may not be allowed to discount liquor in your area.
Offers like happy-hour drink specials or 2-for-1 deals are common in
some areas and unheard of in others.
 No location that may corrupt others: You may not be able to locate
your bar within a certain distance of other buildings, such as churches
and schools.
40
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry 

 No doubles: Some areas set the amount of alcohol in individual cocktails
and require that bars use metered pouring systems to dispense the alco-
hol. These systems may include giving individual-serving size bottles
(think airline bottles) to patrons or using automated dispensers.
 No tabs: In some communities, patrons aren’t allowed to run tabs.
 One at a time: Some states don’t allow more than one drink in front of a
patron at a time. Others limit only liquor and allow as many draft beers
in front of a patron as you can fit on the table.
 Food is required: You may not be able to serve liquor to a patron if she
hasn’t also ordered food. Some states require only that the drinker has
access to a menu.
 No alcoholic doggy bags: Some states allow patrons to take their unfin-
ished bottles of wine home. Others prohibit it.
 Limited or no sales on Sunday: Liquor sales may be limited on Sunday.
These laws, lumped together, are called blue laws. Some states don’t
allow the sale of alcohol on Sundays, others allow it in restaurants, and
others have no restrictions.
Other legal requirements
Depending on your local laws, you may be required to get these official permits:
 Employer tax ID: This permit identifies you when you’re paying
employee taxes and other required fees. It’s like your bar’s Social
Security number. Every business in the country must have a tax ID
number.
 Business license: In some communities, every business owner has to
have these permits, whether you run a bar or a dry cleaner.
Depending on your business and your concept, you may also have to get 
separate permits to operate specific parts of your business. Here are a 
couple examples:
 Elevator: You need to get annual inspections done if you have an 
elevator in your establishment.
 Outdoor seating permit: Some areas require you to have a separate
permit for a patio or outdoor seating.
 Retail tobacco license: You’ll need one of these if you sell cigars 
or cigarettes.
41
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

Getting to Know the Health Inspector
When you’re in the town or city hall, take a walk over to your new best friend:
the health inspector! Health inspectors drop in on businesses that serve food
and beverages to the public and look for cleanliness and proper food-handling
procedures, among other things. Ask to see the all the regulations related to
owning and running your establishment before you open your doors.
Even if you don’t serve food, you still have health codes to follow, so you will
get a visit from the health inspector.
Here are some specific questions to ask:
 Which employees (if any) need a food handlers’ permit? How much are
the fees?
 What classes (if any) are employees required to attend? What’s the cost
to the owner or employee?
 How many sinks are required behind the bar? In the kitchen?
 What health code–related signs must be posted? Where must they be
posted? The obvious one is “All employees must wash hands before
returning to work,” but there may be others.
 Are there any uniform requirements (like hats, gloves, or footwear) for
employees?
Your local health inspector will drop by — unannounced, of course — several
times a year to make sure the public is protected from food-borne illness and
disease spread from employees in bars. If you don’t pass inspection, you’ll
get a report detailing your violations and usually have 24 hours to correct 
all the problems or face a shutdown. The best way to keep your inspections
violation free is to create and maintain excellent standards in your bar. Be
prepared any time of the day. Keep the place clean and keep cleaning.
Establishing a regular cleaning schedule
Create daily, weekly, and monthly cleaning schedules to make sure all areas
in your bar are cleaned thoroughly on a regular basis. Besides the obvious
reason (most people prefer to be in clean and sanitary conditions), the law
requires you to keep your bar clean to inhibit the growth of bacteria and
pathogens that can be a serious public health risk.
42
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry 

Here are some things that need to be done several times each shift, as needed:
 Change water in the glass-washing sinks behind the bar.
 Change sanitizer water.
 Empty trash.
 Break down boxes.
 Clear dirty dishes from tables and the bar top.
 Wipe down the bar top, tables, and seats after each use.
 Wash hands.
You can have workers do these cleaning tasks on a shift-by-shift basis:
 Sweep the walk-in and dish area.
 Empty and sanitize all ice wells.
 Mop the entire kitchen.
 Clean the fryer and filter the fryer oil.
 Send range grates to the dish machine.
 Clean and sanitize all surfaces, such as reach-in coolers, prep tables,
counters on the line, and so on.
 Sweep and mop the main bar and any other floor areas.
 Empty the steam table. Clean, sanitize, and refill the steam table with
fresh water.
 Clean employee bathroom and locker room.
 Wipe down all table-top items, like salt and pepper shakers and table tents.
 Clean public restrooms.
Sunday and Monday make great days to do some more-intense cleaning jobs,
like these:
 Empty reach-in coolers and thoroughly clean and sanitize them. Toss
any items past their prime.
 Empty walk-ins and thoroughly clean and sanitize them. Reorganize and
replace things as needed.
 Pull any movable kitchen equipment away from walls. Clean the walls
and floor behind them. Grease can build up here over time and catch 
on fire. Bugs like to find little bits of stuff that fall back here.
43
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

Monthly cleaning jobs are reserved for more time-consuming projects. Here
are just a few examples:
 Empty out all salt and pepper containers and run them through the dish
area. Let them drain overnight and dry thoroughly before refilling them
or you’ll have some clumping condiments on your hands.
 Remove all glassware from shelves and thoroughly clean the shelves
before restacking glassware.
 Hire an exterminator to preventively treat for pests. On “bug night,” staff
members will need to cover any food items that normally stay out (like
crackers, salt and pepper shakers, and so on) to protect them from
harmful pesticides.
Failing to do these things on a regular basis will lead to problems with 
food safety in your restaurant and will eventually show up in lower 
inspection scores.
Avoiding cross-contamination
Cross-contamination (when bacteria or other organisms present in one food
accidentally spread to another) is one of the leading causes of food-borne 
illness. It can occur at many different points along the food-supply chain, 
but you have to make sure it doesn’t happen in your bar.
Here are a few tips to make sure your place isn’t a haven for bacteria and
other organisms:
 Provide plenty of work space for staff working on a variety of foods at
the same time. You don’t want raw chicken on the same prep table as
the salad greens.
 Clean and sanitize knives and other utensils and equipment before and
after use. It may seem like double duty, but bacteria, dust, and other
stuff can end up on equipment in between uses.
 Provide sanitizer buckets with properly concentrated sanitizer solutions
and clean towels. Check with your cleaning-product supplier for details
on how to use your particular products.
A thorough health inspector will walk around the kitchen as employees are
working and confirm that these (and other) regulations are being followed.
For example, the inspector will check the strength of the sanitizer solution 
to make sure it’s the right concentration to kill germs.
44

Keeping critters out
Bits of food, crumbs, spills, food waste, and other organic material attract
unwanted pests. Make sure that when you store any food products you 
thoroughly cover them. This step helps keep rodents and bugs out of your
supplies and out of your bar.
Don’t allow wet boxes in the kitchen or storeroom. Keep cardboard boxes
outside, if at all possible. Most insects are brought in by deliveries.
Your health inspector will be paying attention to your storage areas so make
sure you are, too.
Bringing In the Big Three: Accountants,
Insurance Agents, and Attorneys
Get the best professionals you can afford. If you don’t know how to find good
representation, ask around. Everyone will recommend someone. Make sure
the people you hire have previous experience in the bar business. Someone
once said, “If you want to play baseball, ask Mickey Mantle, not your dentist.”
The same goes for operating your bar. Seek the right advice from those who
know and have the experience.
Contact the National Restaurant Association (NRA) at www.restaurant.
org to see whether it can recommend accountants, attorneys, and insurance
agents in your area.
45
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law
What about the new smoking laws?
Every day a government (state or local) some-
where passes a no-smoking law for bars and
restaurants. Every day! Ask a good lawyer what
the law is in your area and what changes are
being considered. If you’re in a cold area with
harsh winters, these laws will hurt your busi-
ness. Be prepared to open a cigar bar or con-
nect a cigar bar to your place.
What has happened in places that have passed
a no-smoking law for bars and restaurants? In
New Jersey, where Ray runs a bar, the only
place people can smoke, other than in their
homes, is on a casino floor when they’re gam-
bling or outside the casino. For every other public
building, people have to smoke outside. An awful
lot of bar and restaurant owners added patios
with overhangs, heaters, and plastic walls.

Hiring an accountant
Put an accountant at the top of your list of people to hire to help you with
your new business. Before you even open your doors, an accountant can help
you create your business plan (see Chapter 5, too). He can explain big words
like depreciation, amortization, and capitalization. He can work with your
attorney to show you tax advantages to setting up your business one way
versus another.
After you’re up and running, your accountant can help prepare the monthly
books and reports, prepare taxes, and conduct internal audits and reviews.
Work with your accountant to determine what you need to do and what she
needs to do to make sure all your paperwork is in order.
Working with an attorney
Working together, your attorney and accountant can help you decide how to
set up your business. How you set up your business determines how your
bar is taxed, how you earn an income from your business, what your obliga-
tions are if your bar should fail, and many other expensive decisions.
Here are the most common options for setting up your business:
 Sole proprietorship: You (and your spouse) are the only owner. You
keep all the profits and the debt.
 Partnership: You have one or many partners. You all split the profits
(possibly at different percentages based on different rates of invest-
ment) and share the debt.
 Limited partnership: Limited partners share in the profits but none of
the debt. You pay them back on their investment, but if your business
folds, they’re not responsible.
 Corporation: A corporation is a legal entity that you can create to own
your business. You may be the only shareholder in your corporation, so
you still own the whole thing, but you enjoy the legal protection in case
your business goes bust.
 Limited liability company (LLC): You gain some protections, similar 
to those afforded by a corporation, but you have a different tax 
consequence.
46

Because we are not lawyers and we do not want to get in a lawsuit, the only
legal advice we can give you is to have a lawyer review a contract before you
enter into any agreement. It’s smart business and could save you a lot of trou-
ble and money in the future.
Protecting yourself with insurance
The law requires you to obtain certain kinds of insurance. The amount of 
coverage you carry and the deductible (which is the amount you’re required
to pay before your insurance kicks in) you choose affect the amount of your
premiums (or the amount you pay for your insurance).
Talk with your insurance agent to find the best, most appropriate coverage
for your business.
Here is a list of common business insurance coverage:
 Property: Property insurance protects your property in the event of
damage. Many policies only cover specific damages. You may want to
consider additional coverage that you add to your policy, called a rider,
like earthquake, flood, wind, and hail insurance, if those natural disas-
ters are likely in your area.
 General liability: Liability insurance protects you in the event that
someone sues you for something. Maybe they chipped a tooth on a 
beer bottle, cut their finger on a broken glass, or fell off a bar stool.
Check your lease for any required minimums for liability insurance. 
Your agent should give you recommendations for how much liability
insurance you should carry, based on the assets of your business.
 Liquor liability: When you get your liquor license, check with your local
agency to see what amount of liquor liability insurance you need.
 Workers’ compensation: Usually called workers’ comp, this insurance
takes care of medical bills for your employees who get injured on the job.
 Unemployment insurance: If you fire an employee or have to lay some
of your workers off for business reasons, this insurance pays your out-
of-work, ex-employees until they find another job.
The federal government requires workers’ comp and unemployment insur-
ance. Protect what you have with the right insurance. See your agent for the
best coverage for you.

Taking Over an Existing Bar: 
Some Things to Watch For
Taking over an existing bar is the quickest way to get up and running. The
previous owner can leave customers, stock, and staff in place and hand you
the keys. You have a built-in clientele and staff that know the bar, maybe
better than you do. You may pay more for an existing bar because assuming
you buy a successful bar, it’s already making money. You won’t wait as long to
make a profit, depending, of course, on how much of it you’ve had to finance.
Here’s a list of additional financial things to keep in mind if you’re taking over
an existing bar:
 Taxes: Make sure that all taxes incurred by the previous owner have
been paid. If there’s anything outstanding, make sure you agree on a
plan for taking care of those costs and put it in writing.
 Stock: If you are buying the stock (glassware, bottles of alcohol, appli-
ances, furniture, and so on) in the place, make sure a detailed list is
included in the contract. Then, the night before you close the deal, or
maybe a few hours before you sign on the dotted line, make sure that
everything that you and the seller agreed to is still in the bar.
At this walk-through, if the bar isn’t in the condition you’ve agreed upon
or if the stock is missing, do not close the deal. Wait for the lawyers to
work out the details. At a minimum, you should be compensated for any
items that are missing or the cost involved in returning the bar to the
condition you agreed upon.
 Taking over an existing liquor license: The fewer licenses in your area,
the more the liquor license will cost. Like any commodity, the laws of
supply and demand apply. So before you look for a spot to buy or lease,
see whether there is a liquor license for sale or available.
Looking Closely at Contractor Paperwork
A contractor is a professional who can oversee construction projects in your
bar. When you need to hire a contractor to shore up your bar and make it
operational, make sure you get everything — and we mean everything — in
writing. Be sure the start date, deadlines for each part of the job, and a final
completion date are included in the contract.
48
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry 

If your bar isn’t finished on time, you’ll lose business and money. Make sure
to include daily penalties if the work isn’t finished on schedule. Put every-
thing in writing, and lean heavily on your attorney.
As with any professional, you can find great and not-so-great contractors.
Talk to your banker, local government inspectors, and building inspectors for
recommendations. Ask a lot of questions of the contractors when it’s time to
narrow down your choices.
To find a contractor, check with anyone and everyone you know who’s built
anything. Contractors who build homes also build bars. In some areas, you
may find companies that just build restaurants. They are more expensive, 
but they take care of everything. Depending on your situation, the expertise
may be worth the additional money. And always, always check references.
Take a look at Building Your Own Home For Dummies by Kevin Daum, Janice
Brewster, and Peter Economy (Wiley) for more tips on hiring a contractor.
Before you can begin construction or remodeling of your new space, you
need to get the appropriate building permits. Check with your contractor and
your attorney to make sure that you have the appropriate paperwork in hand
before starting construction.
Getting your Certificate of Occupancy
After you finish construction or modification of your space, your local build-
ing department must issue a Certificate of Occupancy (or your CO) before you
can open your doors. After you file your application for the certificate, an
inspector from the building department visits your facility and thoroughly
inspects the interior and exterior of your location.
Some building departments allow you to file for permits and schedule your
inspections online. Check your local office’s Web site for information.
The Certificate of Occupancy shows the following:
 You’ve followed all building codes. You haven’t forgotten to ground 
all your wires or reconnect your plumbing, for example.
 Your facility conforms to the current safety requirements. These 
requirements include making sure that you don’t have any asbestos 
or lead paint around, your fire exits work properly, and so on.
 Any modifications that you’ve made to your space are sufficient and
appropriate for your new use of the space. Typically, you must submit
copies of your plans with your application for the inspector to review.
 Your building is safe to occupy.
49
Chapter 3: Minding the Money and the Law

Your CO is valid indefinitely unless or until you make changes or modifica-
tions to the structure of your bar. Contact your building department if you
plan to add a room, reconfigure your space, or knock down a wall.
Fire codes and capacity
Before you open your bar, you must also get a permit from the fire department.
The fire marshal inspects your facility during and after construction to ensure
that you have appropriate emergency exits, determine maximum capacity, and
check all fire-suppression systems.
Your fire inspector verifies that all your fire extinguishers are in working
order, too. So make sure that you have them located in handy places with
their current inspection tags attached.

Chapter 4
Deciding What Type of Bar to Have
In This Chapter
 Researching your local area
 Considering all your options
 Putting it together
T
he best kind of bar to open is . . . Gotcha! We can’t fill in this blank for you
because ultimately it’s a different answer for everyone. It would be like
choosing your underwear for you or deciding what kind of deodorant you
should wear. Only we’re not your mom. We are, though, the authors of this
book, and we can help you discover the best bar for you to open.
In this chapter, we lead you through developing your plans for what you truly
want your bar to be. We look at different aspects of your soon-to-be business,
including who your customers are and what your market expects from your
place. We also take you through some of the most popular bar formats in the
country, identifying specifics along the way.
Determining Your Bar’s Potential Market
It may seem like a no-brainer to pattern your bar after the other ten that are
on the same street, but it’s not a given. What if you could do much better by
opening the only falafel-and-margarita bar in town? Okay, maybe that won’t
work, but what will? We don’t recommend just doing what everyone else
does. We want you to do your homework and figure out what works for your
market, your patrons, and your budget (all before you open it).

Conducting your own market research
Conducting market research is vitally important to getting your bar up and
running. Market research involves keeping your eye on other bars in your
area to figure out what they’re doing and why. You need to get a clear picture
of what your competition and your clientele will look like. Check out Small
Business Marketing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Barbara Findlay Schenck
(Wiley) for help.
Keeping up with your customers and the market doesn’t stop when you open
the doors. You need to incorporate this process into your regular business
practices to stay on top of what’s going on in your world. Chapter 16 can help
you with this process.
Begin your research by focusing on four areas:
 Location: Determine how important a convenient location is to your
soon-to-be patrons. Maybe you’re close to your customers’ homes or
workplaces, or maybe they drive past your place on their commute.
Check out Chapter 6 for more information about the importance of the
right location.
 Menu: How many drinks or dishes are enough? Will customers be more
likely to come in if you have a full menu, or are they just looking for a
nightcap? Flip to Chapter 9 for some suggestions.
 Price and value: The price is the amount of money that someone pays
for an item, like a drink. The value is how they perceive what they get
(usually in terms of quality and quantity) compared to what they pay.
Consider both when you price your menu. Check out Chapter 9 for tips.
 Entertainment choices: Do your patrons like live music, games, pool,
darts, or dance tunes? Would they rather be able to have a relaxed con-
versation or slam into each other on the dance floor? What’s available
around town that’s similar to what you’re considering offering? Take a
look at Chapter 6 for help choosing your entertainment.
After you understand the basics of the marketplace, you can ask very specific
questions that pertain to your specific concept.
You don’t have to completely rework your concept to simply fit the mold. 
But it’s better to be armed with information about obstacles early in the
game so you can tweak your ideas or add more money to address problems
as necessary.
52
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

What type of clientele do you want?
Decide who you want your customers to be, and make sure they’re likely to
frequent your concept. Figure out what demographic group(s) you’re likely to
attract. The term demographics describes characteristics or traits shared by
a group. A demographic group includes people within a specific age range or
income level, or who share other distinguishing traits like gender or marital
status.
Over time, build a profile of your desired patrons and tweak your concept, as
appropriate, to appeal to this group. Figure out where they eat and drink.
Discover what motivates their decision to choose one place over another. Find
out what kind of entertainment choices they opt for. And lucky for you, you can
find companies who can help you put this information together. Companies like
Claritas (www.claritas.com) can put together specific profiles of consumers
in your area. They can give you information about the people within one mile
of your bar, two miles, five miles, and so on, to help you make sure your bar is
within easy access to people who match your profile.
Unless you own a motorcycle and ride one, don’t open a bikers’ bar! You
should have the same interests, hobbies, and passions as your clientele. You
won’t be happy faking it just to capitalize on a short-lived trend, and your
clients will smell a fake.
Using competitive analysis
Many businesses adopt some form of a competitive analysis process, a
process that compares them to their competition. Sometimes they look at
specific parts of their business, say comparing their respective happy-hour
offerings. Or maybe they compare their overall concepts. Whatever the case,
you need to develop a tool to help you see what’s going on objectively. 
Table 4-1 is an example of how to set up your own competitive analysis. Use
the criteria we’ve chosen, or adapt it to your own concept to do an objective
study of the competition. Study each of your competitors and create an easy-
to-read spreadsheet so you can quickly compare them.

Scratch that niche: Identifying 
an opportunity
After you get all your information together about the bars in your area, you
need to focus your plan (including your business plan and marketing plan) on
capitalizing on your strengths and exploiting the competition’s weaknesses.
Chapter 5 tells you how to put your business plan together.
Here are some ideas to get you started on identifying your niche (what you
offer that your competitors don’t):
 Look for anything missing that you may be able to provide. In the
example in Table 4-1, both bars are closed on Sunday. Maybe you decide
this town needs a sports bar where people can watch their favorite
teams play on Sunday.
54
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

 Think about things that are missing for some groups of customers but
present for others. For example, a 30-something who wants to play pool
on a Friday night has no options based on the info in Table 4-1. (I guess
she could go check out the pool tables at the college bar, but it might be
a little weird.) So you could consider creating a bar with pool tables,
darts, and shuffleboard designed for that particular demographic group.
 Pay attention to the breadth of the offerings. Although both bars in our
example serve beer, neither bar has a huge variety. Maybe that could be
your thing.
 Consider just how you’re going to be different or better. Carefully con-
sider your market differentiation. If you think you’re going to open a bar
just like the place down the street and the customers will come to you
because of your bright smile, you may want to rethink your concept.
What makes you special?
Most people who buy a bar are trying to fill a niche in the area. Why isn’t
there a pool table around here or a good sports bar or a place to get a good
hamburger and a beer? That’s the question you try to answer now.
Exploring Your Options: What Kind 
of Bar Do You Want?
Maybe you knew before you bought this book that you wanted to open a
local watering hole where the neighbors would be your regulars, and your
market analysis supports that idea. On the other hand, maybe you just can’t
decide what sort of bar to open. You may even have your heart set on one
bar, only to realize that your area is ripe for a totally different type of bar. 
In this section, we outline some of the most common types of bars. But don’t
let our ideas limit you. Some of the most unusual bars are the most success-
ful ones.
After you pick what kind of bar and develop your concept, you need to create
a complete plan to go with it. Create your décor, menu, staff uniforms, and
logo to work together. Check out Chapter 6 for choosing and buying decor.
And of course there are wine bars, martini bars, car bars (NASCAR), cowboy
bars, and candy bars (Snickers, yum!).
We definitely recommend taking field trips to existing bars to help you make
your decision. So, grab your wallet (with money and ID) and get out there and
visit some bars (a tough assignment, we know!).
55
Chapter 4: Deciding What Type of Bar to Have

Sports bar
Sports bars are popular today. They’re usually decorated with extensive
sports memorabilia, like hockey sticks, jerseys, action shots of athletes, 
uniform pieces, and so on.
Typically, their draw is a better selection of televised sports than customers
can get at home. Fans who live halfway across the country from their favorite
teams can go to a bar to watch the games, even if the local affiliates don’t
show them. The bars boast many TVs, often showing separate games and
events on each. Patrons generally sit near the TV showing the event that
interests them most.
Menu options typically include traditional American fare like burgers, sand-
wiches, chicken wings, and chili. Some may offer pizza and salads as well.
Beer and mixed drinks are popular here. Higher-end bars may also choose 
to include ribs or steaks on the menu. They may also have a line of signature
cocktails.
Local drinking establishment
These bars are known primarily for good drinks and good conversation. This
is the place “where everyone knows your name.” The clientele is fairly regu-
lar, and low key. Beer and mixed drinks are the “usual” orders here, but a
bottle of wine may make an appearance on your menu. Food is typically
much lower on the list of priorities and may only consist of peanuts or pick-
led eggs served from a huge jar behind the bar. The only entertainment is
likely a jukebox, but you could expand the entertainment choices to include 
a video game, darts, or a pool table. Look for a basic selection of beers and
mixed drinks here.
If you choose to run this kind of a bar, you can focus on a certain theme, like
an Irish pub, a beer bar, or a whiskey bar, and carry the theme through in
your name, décor, and menu.
Upscale lounge
Upscale lounge is just a fancy phrase that simply means high-class, expensive
bar. Décor is typically what sets this bar apart from the rest. Typically, ultra-
modern, sleek designs and über-trendy fixtures set the tone. The flooring is
almost always something special; part of it may be illuminated from under-
neath or have flowing water under glass tiles. Bar stools, tables, and chairs
may have a retro feel but still be very trendy. Wall décor may include original
works of art, artsy photos, and mood lighting. Patrons are often young,
56
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

trendy, and beautiful. People are often there to see and be seen with the
“right” people. Entertainment is often limited to music, often with a trendy DJ
to spin it.
The drink menus typically contain only premium and super-premium spirits
in their house-created cocktails. (See Chapter 9 for more about the different
categories of liquors.) Drink descriptions detail specific ingredients (like
Kaffir lime leaves and unrefined sugar), include various processes (like mud-
dled, shaken, blended), and usually name the liquors by brand.
The staff in this type of bar is known for impeccable service, so if you think
you may go this route, you’ll need to hire experienced, quality employees and
be ready to pay for their expertise. You may need to hire a great flair bar-
tender to flip bottles to delight your patrons.
Martini bar or lounge
Martini bars tend to be trendy, yet nostalgic. They celebrate the tradition of
the cocktail by elevating one of the most beloved, the martini, to renewed
heights. They usually have a list of house martinis and may have a list of the
house’s take on traditional cocktails like Sidecars, Stingers, and Rusty Nails.
See Chapter 12 if you need recipes for these (and other) cocktails.
Many martini bars are furnished with usable antique couches and chairs, set
up in conversational groupings rather than a dining room–type floor plan.
The décor tends to have a vintage feel, often inspired by time periods, like
the 1940s, 1950s, or even the 1960s. The clientele is often a mix of trendy
people, yuppies, and anyone else who’s interested in the atmosphere.
Often, smooth music accompanies the smooth drinks. Music choices for a
martini bar might include
 Jazz melodies.
 Swing, Big Band, ’40s-era tunes.
 Lounge music like Dean Martin, Wayne Newton, or Frank Sinatra.
 New takes on any of the above styles of music. Newer artists are putting
out retro-inspired music they call “space-age pop,” “atomica,” “bachelor
pad music,” or “cocktail jazz.” Much of it has an organ-meets-orchestra-
meets-elevator-music feel to it, preferably with maracas. Take a listen to
www.luxuriamusic.com to hear examples of this music.
These ideas are not absolute rules. It’s your place, so play what you want. 
A real live, retro lounge act may be a fun way to round out your theme and
satisfy patrons who want live music.
57
Chapter 4: Deciding What Type of Bar to Have

Wine bar
Oddly enough, as the name would suggest, a wine bar specializes in wine. In
most cases, a wine bar’s inventory includes a wide variety of wine, varying vin-
tages, many, many vineyards, and likely many different price points. Some wine
bars have 80–150 wines available by the glass, then another 100 (or more) by
the bottle. Many wine bars only serve wine, no beer or liquor available.
Wine, in volume, can be very expensive. To stock a reasonable level of inven-
tory, be prepared to spend thousands of dollars. And you need to have (or
hire someone with) the expertise to talk about wine in general and the wines
on your list, specifically. The expert who can talk for hours about the nuances
of wine is called a sommelier. People want to know why one wine is better or
more expensive than another. They want help deciphering the difference
between a Beaujolais and a Burgundy. Even your bartenders and servers will
need extensive training, extending at least to your wine list. You need to be
prepared to put in the time.
Because of the incredible variety and range of wines available worldwide
today, more people from all walks of life are interested wine. The best way to
learn about wine is to taste it, so if you’re going to open a wine bar, expect a
varied clientele. But, because wine is not cheap, your clientele will have a
decent amount of disposable income. The wine is the entertainment, so other
than some soothing music, you can skip the other entertainment options.
Wine bars often serve food. Most often, the menu is designed to complement
the food. The sommelier and chef work together to develop food and wine
pairings, and sometimes create flights of wine to match a meal. A flight is
made up of small servings (usually around 2 or 3 ounces each) of several 
different wines, sold together.
To take a peek at some wine bars, check out these Web sites:
 EOS Wine Bar in San Francisco: www.eossf.com/wine.html
 Morrell Wine Bar and Café in New York: www.morrellwinebar.com
 Les Zygomates Wine Bar and Bistro in Boston: www.winebar.com
Bar and grill
What’s another way to spell “bar and grill?” R-E-S-T-A-U-R-A-N-T. Okay, basi-
cally a bar and grill is a restaurant without high chairs. And usually, the
lounge or bar area is not separate from the dining area. So in some states
(like Indiana), kids can’t go in to a bar and grill (or a restaurant for that
matter) if there’s no barrier between the bar and the dining area.
58
Part I: Cheers! Getting Started in the Bar Industry

A bar and grill typically has a more expansive menu than just a bar. If you
open this type of bar, you’ll have, presumably, a grill to make burgers and
sandwiches. You may have a fryer as well for things like, um, fries and wings.
Heck, maybe you’ll even toss a couple of salads on the menu for good health
and good measure.
You can choose a theme for a bar and grill and carry it through the menu and
décor. You will sell quite a bit of beer but will likely have success with select
mixed drinks as well.
Entertainment can run the gamut from video games, to pool and darts, to live
music, or even karaoke. Many bar and grills have TVs for the sports enthusiast
or the stay-at-home moms who need their soap opera fix with their lunchtime
glass of wine. Your entertainment options are open with this kind of bar.
If you’re interested in running a bar that’s pretty much a restaurant, check
out Running a Restaurant For Dummies (Wiley) for more information.
Several casual restaurants (like Applebee’s) have quietly dropped the words
“Bar & Grill” from their name, opting for the more family-friendly “restaurant”
instead.
Live entertainment venue
Some bars are absolutely known for their entertainment. (We immediately
think of the now-defunct legendary CBGB in the Bowery in New York, the bar
that launched hundreds of careers like the Ramones and Blondie in the ’70s
and ’80s.) People drink at these places, to be sure, but they’re not typically
looking for specialty cocktails; the music is the draw.
59
Chapter 4: Deciding What Type of Bar to Have
Brewpubs: A two-fer-one business
A brewpub is more than a bar; it’s a bar and
brewery, all in one. You control your production,
manufacturing, warehousing, inventory, and
everything else. You can decide what styles of
beer to serve, whether you want a wheat beer, a
pilsner, or a stout. You can name the beers what-
ever you want. You can even start a sideline busi-
ness of selling your beer to other places in town.
Sounds good, right? Well, it can be good, but it
requires a whole other level of expertise to start
your own brewpub. (So basically you need this
book plus a master brewer to get going.)
If you’re looking to start a brewpub, spend some
time perfecting your beers in the brewery
before you decide to open the pub. You can roll
out the pub after you’ve built a loyal following
for your beer. Otherwise, you have a really
tough nut to crack, essentially opening two
businesses at the same time.

Here are a few ideas if you’re looking to open a bar focused on live 
entertainment:
 Original bands trying to break into the business: These bands are pop-
ular among the college-age set.
 Cover bands: These bands sing familiar songs in their own particular
style. They often have a broad appeal because although the band may
not be well known, everyone likes to sing along to “Brown Eyed Girl” and
“Mustang Sally.”
 Local favorites: These bands often do a mixture of cover tunes and their
own originals that locals love.
 Country & Western: You can have both kinds of music: country and
western. Depending on your geographic location, this may be a huge hit
for you, either because that’s what people like or because it’s a novelty.
For more information on booking and signing live entertainment, check out
Chapter 6.
Remembering to Choose One Theme 
and Be Good at It
Can you be everything to everybody? No, you can’t. But you can choose
something and be the absolute best at it. (Now we do sound like your mom.)
Although there’s no absolute formula for how to succeed, one tenet rings 
true in this business: Hot food, cold beer. We like to add great service, but it
doesn’t seem as catchy that way.
Yes, you can have a cowboy bar with a martini menu and a beer bar with the
best hamburgers. You can break the theme of your place, but only for one or
two items. (Ray always wanted to own a pizza place and give out fortune
cookies with the meal.)
The most important thing is to have a great drink menu. You run a bar, after
all. When you are doing a theme, carry it through both your drink and dining
menus. Jazz bars should name a couple of cocktails after songs or instru-
ments, like the Brass Trumpet, for example. A cowboy bar should have a
cocktail named the Bull Rider. A sports bar should have a Foul Ball cocktail.
Have fun with your theme. You can even ask your customers to suggest 
creative names.

 Understanding what a business plan is
 Creating your business plan
 Presenting your financials on paper
R
unning a bar is not an endeavor to be entered into lightly. Although the
business is a fun one, you have to approach it as a business to be finan-
cially successful. To keep your bar running in the black, you must create a
business plan, follow it closely, and make adjustments as needed. Over the
years, your business plan can become a living, breathing document that
helps you manage your bar successfully.
A business plan can be a great tool in setting yourself up to succeed in this
business. It’s your map to get from Point A (starting out) to Point B (retiring
to the Caribbean, or whatever your personal goal may be). The more detailed
your map is, the less likely you are to get lost along the way. Before you take
the big trip, planning out your route can help you avoid lost time (in the busi-
ness world, time equals money) and make the journey much less hectic.
In this chapter, we cover the basics of the bar business plan and show you
why you need one. We also give you tips for putting it all together.

What’s a Business Plan and Why 
Should You Create One?
A business plan is a written document that includes information about 
your business, your goals, your strategies, and your financial expectations.
Essentially, it’s your road map or blueprint for creating a successful business,
and it helps you figure out how (and when) your bar will make money.
This document persuades investors to invest in you and landlords to rent to
you. Sometimes, it will be the document that helps you form your team. If you
have partners, the document also helps you plot the course. Of course, you
can adjust the sails as the winds change, but the business plan keeps your
focus on that specific point on the horizon.
Here are the basic pieces of most bar business plans, which we cover in
detail in the following sections:
 Cover page and table of contents: The cover page sets a professional
tone for your business plan. The table of contents helps readers see at 
a glance what information is in your plan and where they can find it.
 Definition of your business concept: In this section, you tell your 
readers what they can expect when they visit your bar. You can include
general information about the atmosphere, the types of food and drinks
you’ll serve, and the customers who will frequent your bar.
 Sample drink and food menu: Here is where you can be more specific
about the food — from appetizers to full meals — and drinks — from a
wide variety of wines to every mixed drink imaginable — you’ll serve.
 Market analysis and clientele demographics: This section of your busi-
ness plan explains how your bar will be different from other watering
holes and describes your intended clients.
 Financial data: This is likely to be the most read section of your report.
You use this section to show investors how you’ll spend your money to
have a successful start-up and then how you’ll keep your bar running in
the black.
 Management team: This part of your business plan explains who is
responsible for running the bar (that would be you, maybe your bar
manager, and a head bartender, if it’s a selling point). It helps readers
understand your qualifications for operating a successful bar.
A business plan helps you ensure that you do all the background research
you need to for optimal success, helps you corral your creative thoughts and
define exactly what you want your new business to be, and helps you head
off obstacles before they become big problems.

Considering the Benefits of 
Having a Business Plan
Many bar owners skip creating a business plan; they think it’s not worth their
time because they can’t accurately predict the future, or they may not know
where to begin. Or they’re intimidated by creating such an official-sounding
document, if they even know what a business plan is. Most owners who skip
this step fail to see that their bar is, first and foremost, a business. And with 
a failure rate of 30 percent in the first year, those who plan have a greater
chance to succeed. In fact, creating a business plan may be one of the most
important steps you take in creating a bar that’s built to succeed. If you
already know you want to create a business plan, skip on ahead to “Looking
at the Parts of Your Plan,” later in this chapter.
We firmly believe that your time is well spent creating a solid foundation for
the business you’re building.
A business plan is a road map to your bar’s success. Without a map, you
won’t know where you are on your road to success or when you can expect
to reach that destination. Failing to plan can result in detours (lost time) that
cost you money in the long run. Many successful businesses regularly update
their business plans, every year or two (or more often if you prefer), to make
sure that they’re on track.
You can use a business plan to regularly assess how well your bar is
 Meeting your financial goals: Are you getting enough sales on Friday
nights to justify staying open on slow post-football Sundays in February,
for example?
 Keeping current with changes in the market: Should you consider
adding a mud-wrestling pit on Wednesday nights to compete with the
new one at Slammin’ Sally’s across the road?
 Addressing your customers’ needs: If your new goal is to have a 
competitive dart league on Thursdays, how’s it affecting the regulars?
65
Chapter 5: Putting Your Business Plan Together

Even if you are 100 percent opposed to creating a business plan, create some
sort of financial forecasting tool that helps you see your cash flow. It’s too
easy to see all the money coming in without a plan for how it must go out in
order for you to stay in business. We recommend that you use the financial
tools in Chapter 14 to run your business successfully, but if you find some-
thing that works better for you, use it.
Looking at the Parts of Your Plan
Because writing a business plan is a big job, even for those with extensive
experience in the industry, we break it down for you, piece by piece, in this
section. We split off the financials into their very own section because they’re
the toughest part of this nut to crack. Make sure you don’t miss them in
“Putting Your Financial Forecasts on Paper,” later in this chapter.
The cover page and table of contents
The cover page identifies your plan and distinguishes it from plans for other
bars, restaurants, or companies that your potential investors may be looking
at. Include the name of your bar, the address (assuming your have one), any
taglines (a catchy phrase, such as “The place for all your sports needs”) you
plan to use, your name and contact information, and your logo, if you have
one. These details add a touch of professionalism that shows you’re serious
about your business.
The table of contents provides readers with an outline for perusing your plan
and includes page numbers so they can flip right to the section that interests
them at the moment.
Your business concept
The first official page of your business plan should describe your business
concept. (We usually don’t count the cover page and table of contents as real
pages. They’re really just there to help your potential investors navigate their
way through your plan.) Your business concept describes your business in
five or six sentences. Think about it as a paragraph or two that envisions
what you want your bar to be when it grows up.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Pretend you’re talking to your ideal bar customers. You have 30 seconds to
persuade them that your bar is the place for them to spend their time (and
money). Figure out what you want them to know. Take a look at the two exam-
ples in this section to see what a finished description looks like.
Here are some questions that you need to ask yourself to get started writing
your own business concept.
 What kind of bar are you going to run? (See Chapter 4 for more details.)
 How is it different from other bars? (See Chapter 4.)
 What’s the atmosphere and décor like? (See Chapter 6.)
 What (if any) specialty drinks (or liquors, beers, and so on) will 
you serve? (See Chapter 9.)
 What entertainment (if any) will you have? (See Chapter 6.)
 What kind of food (if any) will you serve? (See Chapter 9.)
 What’s your clientele like? Who are they? (See Chapter 4.)
 What distinctive features can your patrons expect at your place? 
(See Chapter 4.)
All the answers may not make it into the final description, but it helps you to
know all the information anyway.
Ultimately, you can use your business concept to create a succinct mission
statement for employees, a tagline to go on your drink menus, catchphrases
for T-shirts and bumper stickers, or as the introduction to the financial report
after you’ve franchised your new bar internationally. (Dream big, right?)
Example of a business concept for an Irish pub
The Irish Wolfhound is the premier pub and social gathering place in
Manhattan, Kansas, offering high-quality food, drinks, and entertainment in
an upscale, casual environment with ample seating. We offer a broad menu 
of midpriced appetizers and authentic entrees served in generous portions.
In addition, we stock a full-service, gleaming mahogany bar, featuring a wide
selection of major domestic, imported, and specialty beers, including authen-
tic Irish beers, such as Guinness Stout. Our friendly Irish bartender, with a
brogue to match, serves patrons, and he may even take an occasional break
to throw a round of darts with you. Decorated with intricately hand-carved
wooden panels straight from the Book of Kells, The Irish Wolfhound is full of
character, warmth, and comfort.

Chapter 5: Putting Your Business Plan Together

Example of a business concept for a tequila bar
Añejo (named for the Spanish word for aged that describes premium tequila)
is proud to serve the most extensive collection of tequila on the planet. With
more than 120 varieties available, we have something for everyone. For the
true connoisseur, the bar offers rested (aged 2–11 months) and aged (one
year or more) tequilas. We offer an extensive menu of margaritas, featuring
Sauza tequilas, in a variety of flavors, including blueberry, banana, mango,
peach, piña colada, prickly pear, raspberry, strawberry, and lime. To comple-
ment the tequilas’ flavors, we’ve created a tapas menu, including crab
ceviche with avocado, and corn-and-black-bean salsa with blue corn chips.
With a festive atmosphere, Añejo is a great place to relax after work or get
your night started.
A sample drink and food menu
Include a copy of your menus in your business plan. Take the time to actually
make the menus look like finished, professional menus, rather than just lists 
of drinks or products. The menus help make your place more real in the minds 
of your investors and give them a specific picture of what your bar will be like
and why it’s special. For details on developing, formatting, and figuring a cost
for your menu, check out Chapter 9.
Market analysis and clientele demographics
Here, you show the world in detail how your business is different from the
rest. List concrete examples of other bars in your area (or somewhere else, if
appropriate) that are similar to yours and point out your differences. Consider
their menus, prices, locations, entertainment offerings, hours of operation,
clientele, staffing, atmosphere, and anything else that seems relevant to your
business. This sounds like a lot of work, but you should have done a lot of this
analysis when you decided what type of bar to open (see Chapter 4).
Discuss who your patrons will be. Include answers to questions such as:
What is the age range and income level of the people you’re trying to attract?
How much time and money are they likely to spend in your establishment?
Will they be sports fans or theater-goers? Confirm that you have sufficient
numbers of potential customers to draw from in your market to make your
business a success. Also explain why your concept and marketing plan will
appeal to them. For more on developing your marketing plan and keep guests
coming in the door, check out Chapter 16.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Your management team
This section of your business plan provides information about (surprise!)
your management team. Your management team may consist of partners with
a financial stake, operational managers, or even key employees. Whoever
matters to your audience should make an appearance here. Summarize (in
four to five sentences) the experience, expertise, and strengths of your team
in this section. Include industry-related experience, accolades, and accom-
plishments. Place this section up front in your plan if your team is a strong
selling point; otherwise, it’s usually better placed at the end of the document.
Include information about key personnel here (even if they’re not managers)
if it might positively impact the reader. For example, if your head bartender
won the Flair Bartending Associations Pro tour the last six years running, you
probably want to include that information.
Putting Your Financial 
Forecasts on Paper
At some point, your business plan ultimately comes down to numbers. The
financials section explains how much money your venture will cost, how you’re
going to spend the cash, and how you’re going to build upon it. This section also
offers your investors some kind of return on their investment. Every potential
investor will look at this section of your business plan, even if they look at noth-
ing else. In many ways, it’s the most important piece of the puzzle, and it’s usu-
ally the most daunting piece. But lucky you! You have this book to help you out.
When you forecast your financials, you predict how much money you’ll take
in or spend in a given period of time. In the same way a meteorologist makes
predictions about the weather with some degree of accuracy, you can make
predictions about your bar. Will your forecasts be 100 percent correct in
every instance? Definitely not. But these forecasts are better than just making
guesses. Take a look at the following sections for details about how to predict
different numbers that are important to your business.
Include three sets of numbers for each forecast in your business plan:
 A low-end number that projects your worst-case scenario. Yes, Murphy
and his Law make their way into bars now and again.
 A best-case scenario number that shows all the potential you can 
imagine if everything goes your way. You’ll be retiring in no time!
 The midrange number that takes into account when some things go 
your way and other things don’t. In real life, this is usually the most
likely situation, even if you run your bar perfectly.
69
Chapter 5: Putting Your Business Plan Together

Use a calendar to actually count the number of days in your real operating
months. In the scenario in Figure 5-1 (in the “Forecasting your sales” section
later in this chapter), January, March, and May each had 27 operating 
days, while February had 24. Both the income and expenses were higher 
for those days.
Here are a few basic elements you should make sure to include in the 
financial section of your business plan:
 Forecasted sales: This spreadsheet shows anyone reading your plan
how you predict your sales will grow over a period of time. (Very handy
when trying to persuade investors to give you greenbacks.)
 Forecasted expenses: This prediction highlights how you expect to
spend your money. It shows start-up expenses as well as daily expenses.
 Forecasted cash flow: This document shows how you plan for money to
come in and go out of your business.
 Income statement: Sometimes called a profit and loss (or P&L) state-
ment, this standard accounting tool helps you check the health of your
business. It shows you how you’re making and losing money (or how
you plan to, if you’re just getting started).
 Balance sheet: This spreadsheet is a summary, comparing your busi-
ness’s assets (cash, receivables, inventory, or anything valuable the 
business owns) and your business’s liabilities (money you owe). It’s
basically a snapshot used to assess the health of your business at a 
specific point in time.
We cover these elements in more detail in the following sections.
Forecasting your sales
Your forecasted sales are the sales you expect to take in over a given time. 
We recommend you start your exercise in forecasting here. If you don’t know
how much money you’re making, you can’t figure out what you can spend!
In Figure 5-1, we show you a forecast for a tavern in the Midwest. It has 14 bar
stools and six 4-top tables, for a total seating of 38 people at any one time. Of
course, in bars, people do stand and drink during peak times, so we’ve taken
that into account as well. It serves pub grub like burgers and sandwiches,
draft and bottled beers, and just about any cocktail you can order. It has a
very limited wine list, basically one of each color. And finally, the tavern isn’t
open on Sundays. (The owners, of course, may change that plan during foot-
ball season, but they’ll see how it goes.)

Chapter 5: Putting Your Business Plan Together

To start forecasting, estimate how many people will be in your joint at differ-
ent times of the day (often called your number of covers), and how much
each person will spend (usually referred to as the check average, abbreviated
C/A in the figure).
Here are the steps we followed to get this forecast:
1. Predict how many patrons you will have at each meal period.
We’re looking at 25 lunch patrons during the early weekdays and 30
lunch patrons Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
2. Estimate what each patron will spend.
Based on our menu, we estimate that each person will spend, on 
average, $7 on food and $4 on a drink during lunch.
Notice we said average. Some patrons may order iced tea at $1.50 with
free refills, while others will order three martinis at $7 each. It’s not an
exact science, but you gotta start somewhere.
3. Multiply your covers by your check average to get your total sales for
the day.
We recommend breaking down food and beverage sales separately (as
we did in Figure 5-1), so you can see more specifically where you’re
taking in money.
4. Add your total sales for each day together and divide by the number
of days to get your weekly average.
5. Multiply your weekly average by 52 weeks to get annual sales.
6. Estimate your growth percentage year over year.
In our example, we’re planning on growing our sales by 10 percent each
year. So we would multiply our 2007 numbers by 1.1 (or 110 percent) to
figure out how that percentage translates into real dollars.
This example is a simple representation of an average week. But many say
that in this business there are no average weeks. Make sure you take into
account any seasonal events that may affect your business, such as sports
seasons, resort-based ebbs and flows, and holidays.
Forecasting your expenses
Forecasting your expenses is similar to creating your home budget, only it’s 
a whole lot more detailed. When you forecast your expenses, you anticipate
every possible expense that you may incur, but you hope to reduce those
72
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

expenses and control costs as you actually spend the money. For example, if
you estimate your monthly home grocery bill at $100 a week, but you find an
excellent sale, you’re going to save the money rather than just fork it over to
the grocer anyway. It’s the same with forecasting your expenses for your bar:
Plan for the worst case, then manage the money to the best of your abilities.
To help you think of every possible thing you may need to get your bar up 
and running, Figure 5-2 is the list of accounting codes the National Restaurant
Association (NRA; www.restaurant.org) recommends. If you’re starting 
a bar from scratch, use this list to help you anticipate expenses you may 
otherwise skip. The NRA also offers research you can use to help predict your
expenses or check whether any of your expenses are out of line. Your local
restaurant association should also be able to help you estimate some expenses
by obtaining data from other members. This information adds credibility when
you’re asked how you derived your figures.
Pick up a copy of Accounting For Dummies by John A. Tracy (Wiley) to get
more help on using these and other accounting tools.
When you put together your real financial forecast, include a full year of data
and make sure you include every expense you can think of. Check out Figure
5-3 for a sample expense forecast that covers a six-month period. Make sure
you remember to include your best, worst, and midrange set of numbers for 
a complete picture. (Yes, complete the worksheet three times.) In particular,
look at the last column in the chart, Total Percentage of Sales. We used the
forecasted sales from Figure 5-1 to figure out the sales for each month. Then
we multiplied the monthly total by the percentage specified in each row to
figure out how much we could spend on each particular line item each
month.
The expenses in Figure 5-3 are broken down into two categories:
 Controllable expenses: These are expense you have control over. For
example, you choose how much liquor to buy, how you pour it, control
it’s usage and waste, and so on. These expenses often go up as your
sales go up.
 Non-controllable expenses: These expenses, such as the rent, occur 
regularly. You have to pay these costs no matter how much you buy 
and sell.
Technically speaking, you should also accrue for depreciation, interest, and
other accounting-ish items you may not think about on your own. Get with
your accountant for details on how to get this done.

Chapter 5: Putting Your Business Plan Together

Forecasting your cash flow
In a nutshell, your cash flow projection shows you month by month where the
money is coming in and going out. It sort of marries the sales and forecasts
reports and shows you when you’ll have what money. It helps you manage
your money on a timeline. Take a look at Figure 5-4 for an example of a six-
month cash flow projection. For more details on keeping your eye on your
cash flow, see Chapter 15.
You could actually create a week-by-week (or even day-by-day) report after
you’re up and going, but for the business plan, you really only need this
month-by-month version.
Generating an income statement
Your income statement is a tool that estimates your profit by taking your 
forecasted sales and subtracting your forecasted expenses. In Figure 5-5, we
show you a sample using the same numbers we use throughout the chapter.
Some people call this tool a profit and loss statement or P&L. Whatever you
call it, it works the same way.
Creating a balance sheet
A balance sheet is a summary of your business’s assets and liabilities on a
given date. It takes into account all the business’s assets, including inventory
on hand, your receivables (or money owed to the business), cash on hand or
in any accounts, equipment, vehicles, and so on, and compares them to its
liabilities (money the business owes to people like investors and creditors).
You use the balance sheet to assess the health of your business at a specific
point in time. It helps you show investors or anyone else looking at your
books that your business is worth as much as it owes. If you haven’t yet
invested a single dollar in the business and you don’t owe anyone money, it
will look like the blank form in Figure 5-6.

Selecting Your Bar’s Site, 
Décor, and Name
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best location for your bar
 Picking the right name
 Decorating your bar
 Getting the right equipment to entertain your patrons
 Developing your music plan
Your bar should have a certain mood, a feel, an atmosphere that draws
people in and makes them want to linger and spend their money. You, 
as the owner, set the tone for the experience your customers have in your
place from the first moment you start planning. By choosing the location 
that fits your idea, your goals, and your patrons, you set the stage. When
selecting your name, you give your patrons something to talk about that
sticks with them and paints a picture before they’ve even walked in the door.
After they’re inside, the décor, entertainment, and music options complete
the experience.
In this chapter, we walk you through each step of that process, from choosing
just the right spot to open your place to giving your baby (oops, we mean
your bar) a name. We offer suggestions on the ideal furniture and other design
elements to please your patrons visually. And we help you choose how to
entertain them so they come back again and again.
Finding Your Bar’s Ideal Location
Location, location, location is the cardinal rule in real estate. But what does
that have to do with your bar? Ultimately, you have to choose which location
fits your business, your patrons, and your goals. And remember, the better the
location, the more expensive it is. You get what you pay for, so be creative and
you can save money.

Here are a few general ideas to get you thinking about the right place for 
your bar:
 Consider a spot near offices, near residential neighborhoods, in strip
malls, or near a sporting complex. These areas can be great locations
because people are already in the area using related services. Your
prospective patrons can just stop by on their way to or from these
places.
 Corners are desirable because people can see you from two streets
instead of one. You’ll get more exposure, instead of being buried in the
middle of the block. But remember, you typically pay more for corner
locations, so balance the added exposure with your budget to find the
best answer for your business.
 Check with your city or county zoning boards about your intended 
use of different locations. Each town has specific laws about where you
can open a bar. Most governments won’t let you operate a bar within so
many feet of a school or church, for example. Take a look at Chapter 3
for details on getting a liquor license.
In this section, we break down the process of looking for just the right 
location for your bar, with lots of specifics along the way.
Is location truly everything?
At the end of the day, yes, location really is everything when it comes to 
picking a site for your bar. But what constitutes a prime location is different
things to different people. Most people look at the real estate market and
potential locations in one of two ways:
 A sure thing: Many people start a bar in an already hip, trendy area of
town and hope to make some profit. Locations where people are often
mingling provide a built-in customer base. But these locations come at 
a price, usually in the form of high rent.
 Speculation on neighborhood turnaround: Some folks choose to be
prospectors and hit an area before it becomes a great entertainment
neighborhood. If you go this route, you typically pay less rent, but you
won’t have a built-in customer base, at least for a while. You may need 
to spend more on marketing and advertising just to get people to your
door. Just keep in mind that with the greatest potential for profit comes
the greatest possibility of failure. Your real estate agent should be able
to help you find up-and-coming locations.
If you choose to establish your bar in an area before it becomes hot, you
may not realize your business potential for a couple of years. Make sure
that you have enough cash to sustain the wait.
82
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Identifying possible areas
Many different locations can make a great location for your bar. You can con-
sider downtown areas, suburban areas, even abandoned warehouses. With a
little research and a lot of vision, you can find just the right place for your place.
Everything starts with the local real estate market. Here are a few ways to
find potential locations:
 Work with a commercial real estate agent or business broker. Some
real estate agents specialize in buying and selling businesses and busi-
ness property. They may work independently or in a division of a large
real estate company. Finding someone who knows the restaurant and
bar market is preferable.
 Drive around neighborhoods you think you might be interested in.
Get out of your car and take a walk around the area. Look for locations
that interest you, even if it’s not obvious that they’re up for sale or lease.
 Check in with your local chamber of commerce. It’s a good source for
resources. You can get insights into key tourist areas, tax benefits and
consequences of certain areas, and demographic information about
your community.
 Contact your local restaurant or bar owners’ association. These organi-
zations typically have a small membership, and everyone knows who’s
coming and going. Check out www.restaurant.org to find a chapter
near you.
 Get info from your local governing bodies. Town councils, zoning
boards, and any other agency or board that doles out licenses is likely 
to know of new development and rezoning opportunities.
 Talk with liquor, wine, and beer salespeople. They are sometimes the
first to hear about locations opening up and zoning changes.
83
Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name
How much does size matter?
Most bars seat fewer than 75 people at tables
and 20 or fewer at the bar. Bars are warm and
friendly places. Keep yours small and tight for
employees and customers. You should be able
to yell to someone and be heard on the other
side of the room. You’re running a bar! It should
be a place where everyone knows your name,
you can relax, have good conversation, watch
a great ball game, listen to a great jukebox, eat
a great meal, have a great cocktail or beer, play
pool or other bar games, and spend some time
enjoying your life. This is a bar!
If you want a bigger place, check out Running a
Restaurant For Dummies (Wiley) written by
coauthor Heather Dismore, along with Michael
Garvey and Andrew Dismore.

Knowing what to avoid
In a perfect world, people will beat a path to your bar’s door, no matter where
you’re located. But in the real world, outside factors affect your business
more than you may guess. Your best bet is to pinpoint and avoid things that
may keep customers away from your bar.
By asking questions of other shopkeepers in the area you’re considering, you
can get the scoop on what’s being planned and what’s currently going on in
the neighborhood. You can also get a feel for what kind of clientele you may
attract. You may also get an inkling about what kinds of services in the area
might turn off your potential patrons.
It’s very hard to say what to avoid; some of the formerly worst neighborhoods
are now the trendiest.
For starters, avoid locations that feature:
 Businesses that your customers may find unsavory. Consider the
impact of close proximity to places such as adult video or bookstores,
free clinics, and pawn shops. Your patrons may feel uncomfortable and
may stop coming altogether.
 Permanent construction zones. You don’t want heavy machinery and
trucks going through the area during prime business hours. Patrons may
have a tough time navigating their way through the construction mess. If
the construction is short term or pervasive throughout your area, you
may not be able to avoid it. But if your heart is set on the area, give it
your best shot.
Spend the necessary time talking to the people at your city, county, and
state transportation departments. They can tell you what their long-
term plans (one-, three-, and five-year time frames) are regarding road
projects in the areas you’re considering. Surviving and/or recovering
from an extended road construction project can be difficult or impossi-
ble. Many of your potential customers will choose other routes to their
destinations and never even find out that you exist. The ones who know
about you won’t want to deal with the hassle.
On the flip side, you may be able to negotiate a better deal if the site is
going through a transitional time. Eventually, the construction is going
to clear up, and until it does, you may be able to draw the construction
workers in for a brewski after a long day on the job.
 Remote or hard-to-find addresses. If they can’t find it, they won’t! 
(Did Yogi say that?) Don’t locate your bar in a remote or hard-to-get-to
location. Walking through alleys or driving more than 10 or 15 minutes is
unlikely to happen. People are less likely these days to venture far from
home when drinking.
84
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

On the other hand, some patrons look for out-of-the-way places or get-
aways. Do an Internet search for “hideaway bar,” and you’ll find many
successful, longstanding establishments. Whether they’re hiding from
their spouse, boss, or AA sponsor, many people like to drink at remote
and hard-to-find places. You just have to decide if that’s the kind of place
that you want to have.
Contact your local law enforcement agency to get the scoop on crime rates in
your potential location. Find out what kinds of crimes occur and how often, and
get any information about what the agency expects to happen in the future.
Competition for bar business is stiff. Choose the most attractive location you
can afford. Don’t just think “If I build it, they will come.” Unless of course a
whispering cornfield says it to you. Then by all means, build it wherever you
want, Mr. Costner.
Considering traffic and parking in the area
Traffic is the movement of vehicles and people along a route. Notice we said
people as well as vehicles. Consider foot traffic, private vehicles, and public
transportation when you evaluate the ease of getting to your place.
Here are some things to look for to ensure you have good traffic flow and
ample parking:
 Consider the sheer number of people. Granted you can’t stand there 
all day with a counter watching people walk by (you’ve got work to do,
darn it!), but if your business plan requires you to have 200 people a
night to break even and you don’t have a single person of drinking age
near your place, you need to know right away.
 Figure out where people are going. Are they commuting, shopping, or
eating and drinking in nearby establishments? Formulate ideas about how
(and for how long) you can lure them into your new bar. Think about what
may keep them in the bar stools and keep them coming back.
 Look at the pace at which they’re moving. Are people harried, or are
they strolling leisurely? Do they look like they may be interested in stop-
ping in for a beer, or are they in too much of a hurry? If people are driving,
are the vehicles moving fairly steadily? Are there tie-ups that keep cars
from moving? Do people need to wait for a left-turn arrow to turn into
your parking lot?
 Make sure you have parking near your bar. Your patrons shouldn’t
have more than a three-block walk to your bar. If parking is free, even
better. Make sure those three blocks are a safe walk for your patrons. If
you have to hire a valet, it will cost you some cash, so budget for it.
85
Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

If you’re located in an urban area, parking is less of a concern than if
you’re in a suburban area. More walkers will visit your bar in the city;
suburbanites tend to drive.
 Consider whether patrons have easy access to your location. If they
have to drive past your bar, turn left at the next light, and then back-
track to get to you, they may not bother.
Thinking about a location’s security
Security is a key concern for any business owner. Bars tend to be cash rich,
although credit and debit cards definitely claim their share of sales. When the
cash flows (or at least the perception that it flows), bars can be a tempting
target for thieves.
You can head off security problems before they start by making sure that
your bar includes these safety features:
 Working locks and alarms on exterior doors or other secure areas.
 Working security system with cameras.
 Safe access to and from the garbage area. Your trash may be dumped a
few times during the night.
 Plenty of food storage in secured areas.
 Well-lit exterior and parking lots.
 A working safe.
A little bit of time and money on your part will take care of these matters.
No matter where your bar is located, however, you can keep yourself, your
managers, your employees, and your patrons safe by heeding this advice:
 Avoid buildings with blind interior and exterior corners. Blind corners,
like blind driveways, are corners that can’t be seen from the normal flow
of traffic. These spots are a perfect place for a thief to ambush someone.
 Stay away from buildings with poorly lit stairwells and hallways. If
you do choose a location that’s poorly lit, make sure you immediately
make improvements to remedy the situation.
 Consider potential terrorist targets when selecting your location. This
particular point may not be the most important one in making your deci-
sion, but if you’re considering a location near a courthouse, a power plant,
or a federal building, you run the risk that you may have to temporarily
close your doors during bomb threats, evacuations, and the like.
86
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

These potential terrorist targets may be terrifically busy locations, and
you may have absolutely no problems and instead reap the rewards of 
a built-in population ready to imbibe with you. Just consider the full pic-
ture before you sign on the dotted line.
Comparing an apple (martini) to an
orange (whip): The final choice
No two locations are alike, so if you find more than one likely area for your
bar, it can be tough to pick one over the other. After all, if you choose one
(because of the 24-foot mahogany bar), you may be giving up another great
space (with the kitchen that’s already perfect for you). Although this can be 
a good problem to have, you still have a tough decision to make.
After you’ve narrowed your choices down to a few locations, do some good,
old-fashioned detective work to get an intimate feel for the area.
 Be a pedestrian: Walk ten blocks in every direction, and see what’s
going on. Talk to everyone: shop owners, gas station attendants, people
walking down the street, bus drivers, train conductors, ticket sellers. Say
hello, ask if they have a minute to talk, and tell them your plans. It may
surprise you that people like to talk and give you ideas and opinions.
Be an investigator. Look up and down the street, peek in the alleys, go
into every store, and see what business is like. Stop, look, and listen.
 Act like a commuter: Get on the bus or the train, if one is nearby. 
Take the ride and look around. Figure out how easy or difficult it is for a
commuter to make a stop at your place on the way home. Check out the
public transportation stops for advertising opportunities.
If you set up shop in an area with bus or train lines nearby, make sure
you keep the local public transportation schedules handy. People will
ask you about them.
Ideally, you’ll stay in your location a long time; this is a very big move. Get to
know everyone and everything.
You can also research the history of your proposed space, building, and
neighborhood. Find out what was there before and what has succeeded and
failed. Try to figure out why businesses in the area made it or didn’t survive.
Here are a few ways to get started on your research:
 Ask landlords for information. At a minimum, they can give you the
names of previous tenants or information about the businesses that
have come before yours.
87
Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

 Visit the library. Resources such as archived court records, old newspa-
pers, and local histories at your library can be helpful if the space you’re
interested in has been around for a long time. Check with a librarian in
areas like Local History, or other similar areas, to help you find relevant
information.
 Talk to past owners and lessors. They may share invaluable information
on their problems and solutions for the space, saving you some trial and
error down the road.
 Check in with your local building department. All renovations, addi-
tions, and many minor construction projects require permits, which must
be granted by the building department. The building department keeps a
copy of all plans and permits on file. You can use this information to look
at infrastructure improvements or gauge the date of different construc-
tion projects to help you make an informed location selection.
 Contact your local restaurant association. If the space you’re consider-
ing used to be a bar or restaurant, the group may have the scoop on why
it’s not now (or why the owner’s selling). Go to www.restaurant.org
to find a chapter near you.
In the end, you have to be the final decision maker about what you need most
out of a location. You have to look at what each location offers and choose
the best one for your bar.
Choosing and Establishing 
Your Bar’s Name
It may be true that “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Not so
for a bar! Great bar names evoke pictures in patrons’ minds. Sometimes they
choose one bar over another based on the name alone.
People choose names based on important people in their lives, historical 
or fictional characters, heritage, or simply where the bar is located. Maybe
you have a favorite uncle who loved to drink scotch in a big chair by the 
fireplace, so you name your bar Uncle Matty’s Bar. Or maybe you’re Irish by
heritage and want to evoke that feel in your place, so you name your bar the
Donegal Tavern. Whatever your reasons, you can create a name that repre-
sents your vision and connects with your patrons.
At the end of the day, the single most important thing about naming your 
bar is that the name and the atmosphere must be in synch. Your name must
match your concept or theme. People should hear the name and have a pretty
decent idea of what to expect when they walk into your place. (Besides, if you
come up with a great name and logo for your bar, you can print and sell some
great T-shirts!)
88
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

The name: A few words about your bar
When you name your bar, you have your single greatest opportunity to 
connect your vision for your place with potential patrons. You need to 
give them something to remember in a positive way.
Here are a few things to think about when choosing a name for your place.
 Consider geographic locations. This can be based in reality (Mountain
View Bar in Denver) or wishful thinking (Beachfront Bar in St. Louis). Try
words like by the sea, lakeside, landings, creeks, ocean view, river, arctic,
trackside, station, depot, train stop, living room, bedroom, hotel bars,
lobby, terrace, factory, home, and house.

 Think about different themes. Just about anything’s a possibility here:
sports bars, billiard bars, biker bars, eateries, jazz; ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s
bars; seafood, steak, lobster, and ethnic bars.
 Base it on your specialty. If you’re specializing in wine, you could use
words like cellar, cave, cork, grape, vat, and wine in naming your place. If
you’re specializing in beer, consider words related to beer and brewing,
like hops, wort, barley, malt, ferment, styles of beer (ale, stout, and so on),
brewhaus, or brewpub.
 Get creative with the specific type of establishment you run. Words
like bar, place, saloon, joint, lounge, bistro, café, bar and grill, grille, club,
pub, tap room, manor, palace, tavern, inn, and sports bar can pair with a
first (or last) name to finish it up. Just add your name to the front of one
of these, after you decide which one you want to be: Ray’s Manor, Ray’s
Bar, Heather’s Saloon, Heather’s Bistro, or Heather’s Pub.
 Play off the area of town where you’re located. A bar located in the
financial district could be called In the Red. Near government and politi-
cal buildings could be a great place to launch a bar called Hot Air Saloon.
Now that you’re armed with this information, you have to pick a name for
your bar (we think this name is already taken). This is the fun part; you will
get many suggestions from everyone. Take your time, and choose a great
name. This is a very important decision. It will be with you for a long time.
Protecting your bar name and trademarks
As you build your business, you build your reputation. Your patrons have an
expectation when they step in the door. If you’re successful, they associate
all the terrific things about your bar with its name and atmosphere. The last
thing you want someone to do is to sabotage your hard work by stealing your
name and using it to open his own place.
Consider how you want to use your name. Are you hoping to sell merchan-
dise (like beer mugs and T-shirts) that includes your name and logo? And
think about where you want to use your name. Maybe you just want to stay
local, or maybe you want the option to expand and franchise someday.
Depending on your answer, you need to search for your name in a couple 
of different ways.
Performing a search on your potential name
Go to your favorite search engine (like Google, Yahoo, or Ask.com) on the
Internet. Search for bars (or restaurants, delis, and so on) that have the same
name or a name similar to the one you’re choosing.
90
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Next, consider using a domain name lookup service, such as Whois.com
(www.whois.com), to find out whether a particular Web site address that 
corresponds to your name is taken and, if it is, who owns it. If the Web address
you want to use is available, you can register the domain name for as little as
$4.95 a year to hold on to it. And this site offer a service to buy a domain name
for you, even if it’s already registered with someone else. It may cost a bit to
get one that’s already been taken, assuming the owner is even interested in
selling it. (For more on using a Web site to promote your bar, see Chapter 16.)
Trademarking your name
Plan ahead and trademark (or register) your name, logo, taglines, and so on.
Get the proper paperwork to protect your intellectual property in your state
and in the entire country. This prevents other bar owners from slapping your
bar’s name on their business. The nerve!
A trademark or intellectual property attorney can help you navigate through
the confusing landscape, but here are the basic steps you need to follow:
1. Incorporate your restaurant.
This step makes you a legal entity. Look for more information about
incorporation in Chapter 3.
2. File an application with the county or state office that deals with
trademarks.
This step makes the corporation the sole owner of your trademarks in
your class of goods or services (delicatessen, restaurant, and carryout
restaurant are examples of a few classes of services currently registered)
in your state.
This legal jargon basically means that no other restaurant or food service
company in your state can use the same name, logos, and the like. If a
skateboard company wants to use the name to market its skateboard, it
can probably do so, unless you file separate applications for each and
every class of goods or services around.
3. File an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
This step protects your marks throughout the country. Check out the
USPTO Web site at www.uspto.gov to search the database of registered
trademarks.
If you plan to expand your bar, franchise your name, or have several
locations, have your attorney file for international trademarks as well.
Don’t assume that because your future mark isn’t listed that someone hasn’t
applied for it. The only way to be completely sure is to file your own applica-
tion and get it approved. Check out Patents, Copyrights & Trademarks For
Dummies by Henri Charmasson (Wiley) for more information on this process.
91
Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

Picking Out Your Bar’s Décor
Choosing a bar’s décor is critical to creating just the right atmosphere for
your customers. The décor you choose sends a message to your patrons
about your place and who your clientele is. It can even give them clues 
about what kind of drinks you pour and what entertainment you offer. 
Plus, it’s among the super-fun jobs in opening your own place.
Ultimately, you have to decide what style fits with your bar. Are you looking
for sleek modern lines? Do you want retro ’50s-inspired bar stools to match
your retro jukebox? Maybe you’re looking for classic wood chairs and tables
to evoke a warm and comforting tone. What you buy sets the tone for your
bar. This section can help you get started finding the right décor for your bar.
As much as we’d like to give you some guidelines about how much you
should plan to spend on furnishing, lighting, and decorating your bar, it’s just
impossible. Your budget, the size of your bar, the number of furniture pieces
and lighting fixtures you need, and your tastes will determine how much
you’ll spend.
Finding furniture
There’s no shortage of furniture to furnish your bar. So many styles, colors,
and heights to choose from, so little time. In most cases, you probably want
the furniture to coordinate to some extent. Unless, of course, you’re going for
an eclectic style.
Figuring out what you need
No two bars are the same. What works for us may not work for you and vice
versa. But most bars have a few common elements that you need to consider
when setting up your furniture budget.
Here’s a good place to start when you’re figuring out what pieces you 
actually need:
 Bar stools: What’s a bar without bar stools? You can find these guys in a
variety of heights, materials, styles, and colors. Literally, the possibilities
are endless. Consider whether you want a back on the stool, and if you do,
how high you want it. Some modern-style bar stools have a low back that
gently cups the patron’s backside. Others are high-back bar stools that
help keep even the most lounging lizard in his seat. Some come with a
hydraulic lift (think barber chair) that lets customers adjust their seat,
while others are a fixed height. You can find aluminum, wood, chrome,
wrought iron, or stainless steel frames. And if you choose upholstered
92
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

stools, you can select vinyl, leather, or cloth in many different colors and
patterns. Some stools swivel; some don’t. Some are mounted to the floor;
others can be dragged from one side of the bar to the other. Expect to pay
between $100 and $400 apiece for these, depending on the materials and
features you want.
Most bar stools come in varying heights. Consider the height of your bar
before you buy your stools. Take a look at the sidebar “What’s the right
bar height?” later in this chapter for help.
 Chairs: If you’re the matchy-matchy kind of decorator, you can pick from
all sorts of chairs to match your bar stools. In fact, often when you order
bar stools and chairs, you can simply select the same basic chair in
varying heights to fit your bar, counter, or tables. The number of chairs
you need corresponds directly to the number of tables you choose.
Always choose even numbers, either two or four chairs for each table,
depending on its size.
 Tables: Tables come in three basic heights: dining room, counter, and
bar height. You can get tables in lots of materials, styles, and colors, just
like any other furniture, so the sky (and your budget) is the limit. Some
even have a little ledge and hooks under them to hold things like purses
and cellphones. And if you choose tall tables, consider looking for some
that have footrests for comfort.
Consider your menu when you choose your tables. The size of the 
tabletop varies (anywhere from 20 to 48 inches in diameter), and your
patrons need more space if your plates are big. You can skip the big 
60-inch table for a bar. Large parties typically just push small tables
together, and a big table ties up too much space.
 Outdoor tables and chairs if you have outdoor seating: You need durable,
lightweight, and easy-to-clean furniture for outdoor seating. Look for
wrought iron, resin, or PVC depending on what fits your style and budget.
If you opt for glass-top tables, make sure you buy tempered glass. If 
the table flips over in the wind, it will break like auto glass into small, 
relatively harmless pieces, rather than sharp, jagged shards.
Finding places to buy furniture
We suggest always buying your furniture locally. The salespeople at these
companies can become your customers. Check your local furniture stores
and restaurant supply houses in your immediate area, but here are a couple
more recommendations:

If you can find quality used furniture, snap it up! Used furniture is always a
good deal. Many bars go out of business in the first two years (unless they
read this book) and get rid of their furniture, which probably hasn’t seen too
much wear and tear. Some of this furniture can be purchased at very good
prices, but buy only what you need. Don’t buy something because the price
is great unless you have a lot of storage.
Looking at lighting
Lighting options are as varied as the people who buy them. One thing is
essential though: You have to be able to adjust the light level in the bar as the
sunlight comes and goes. Plus you definitely need to turn the lights up at the
end of the night to give everything a thorough cleaning.
Common lighting options include
 Pendant: A pendant light is a single light fixture that hangs directly from
the ceiling. It has a single lamp and shade.
 Track lighting: Track lights usually come in a system, often with four 
to six lamps per set. The track is installed on the ceiling, and the lights
slide along the track. This setup allows you to position the individual
lamps where you need them.
 Recessed lighting: Recessed lighting is actually fixtures and bulbs
installed in holes cut into the ceiling. The bulbs may extend slightly 
from the ceiling, but most of the fixture is in the ceiling.
 Sconces: These fixtures are mounted flush against the wall. They offer
great mood lighting. You can find sconces shaped like streetlamps, can-
dles, glowing boxes, you name it.
 Chandeliers: The word chandelier may conjure images of opulently cut
crystals hanging from the ceilings of ballrooms or swanky hotels, and
you may run the other direction. But the term chandelier really just
means a light fixture that hangs from the ceiling with multiple arms or
branches of lights. They’re made in many styles, colors, and sizes, from
incredibly ornate to simple and sleek.
94
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

 Flush mount: These fixtures are installed flush with the ceiling and offer
general lighting. (They don’t illuminate particular areas; they just generally
light a room.) They’re most often used in bars (or areas in bars) where the
ceiling is low or standard. If you have high ceilings, choose a hanging light
of some sort for the majority of your lighting needs.
 Rope: Rope lights are flexible tubes of light used to accent areas of your
bar, rather than provide lighting per se. Use them to line the corners of
the ceiling, outline artwork, or even write a message that you don’t want
your customers to miss.
Always check with your local electrician and electrical houses for lighting
recommendations. These people can become your customers and, face it, in
your business, you always need an electrician. So hook up with two electri-
cians in your area and always have their phone numbers available.

What’s the right bar height?
A standard bar height is 42 inches from the floor
to the top of the bar. Of course, yours may be
higher or lower, so measure it. Then take these
steps to figure out what height stools you need.
1. Measure the distance from the bottom edge
of the bar on the side where patrons sit to
the floor.
Remember, sometimes bars have thick
wood trim on the public side of the bar that
patrons sit under. We’re assuming it’s a 2-
inch thick counter, so the bottom sits 40
inches from the floor.
2. Subtract 10 or 11 inches or so for your
patrons’ legs to fit comfortably. The result-
ing number is the optimal seat height.
We used 10 because it’s a nice round
number, so we’re now 30 inches from the
floor. We would look for 30-inch bar stools.
Remember, the seat height is the distance from
the ground to the top of the stool’s seat, not the
seat back. Seat backs vary widely, so we’re not
talking about that here. We’re only looking for
the most comfortable seat height for your cus-
tomers when they belly up to your bar.
Here are a few other measurements you might
find handy in your search for the perfect furniture.
 The average dining-room table runs
between 28 to 30 inches high, and your
average dining-room chair has a seat
height of around 18 inches.
 The average bar table is 42 inches high and
takes a 30- to 32-inch stool.
 The typical counter-height table is 36 inches
high. Counter stools to match these typically
have a seat height around 24 to 26 inches.
 Extra-tall bars can be high as 48 inches. You
need stools with seat heights between 34
and 36 inches to sit comfortably. Make sure
you follow the steps to measure the height
to get a perfect fit.
If math isn’t your thing, create a bar-stool model
using a regular chair and phone books (or
newspapers, magazines, whatever you can pile
on the seat). Stack the books to your desired
height on the chair. Push it all under your bar to
see if it fits. (Be careful if you try to sit on it.) If
you’re happy with the fit, measure it and you’re
in business.

be good for your bar, check out these online retailers:

Never buy used lighting. Used lighting can be dangerous; you never know
how the previous owner tinkered with it. And lighting has to meet certain
codes, which is why you should always consult a licensed electrician for 
help with lighting.
Figuring out flooring
Easy-to-clean, durable, and slip-proof are key words to consider when decid-
ing on flooring for your bar. Popular choices include wood, concrete, natural
stone (like slate and granite), vinyl, linoleum, brick, laminates, and ceramic
tile. Many kitchens opt for a slip-resistant tile that’s easy to scrub down at
the end of the night.
We recommend that you stay away from marble or tile floors. Both are slippery
and increase breakage. And stay away from shag carpeting — it’s just ugly!
To get an idea of commercial flooring options check out these online retailers:
 Armstrong Flooring: www.armstrong.com/commflooringna
 Elite Crete Systems: www.elitecrete.com
 Exceptional Flooring: www.exceptionalflooring.com/
flooring.html
 Tarkett Commercial: www.domcotarkettcommercial.com/us
You can also check your local carpenters, flooring houses, carpet showrooms,
Home Depot, and Lowe’s, but make sure you look at commercial products, not
residential.
Legally, you need to use commercial-quality flooring materials that meet the
ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements, rather than residential-
grade flooring. You keep your customers safe and get a longer-lasting product.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Working on the walls
Walls can be as simple as white plaster you decorate with pictures of your
favorite sports stars or as complicated as hand-painted murals. No material
is off limits these days.
Here are just a few common wall treatments you can find in bars today.
 Vinyl wall covering: This is thick, commercial-grade wallpaper. It comes
in lots of textures and patterns and is highly durable. You can find cover-
ing that looks like natural stone, leather, handmade paper, or individual
tiles. You can find wall covering with a fabric look, stripes, wood panel-
ing, or even saw grass.
Take a look at Wallpaper Wholesaler (www.wallpaperwholesaler.
com) and click on “Commercial Wallcovering” to get a feel for the variety
available. Command 54 (www.command54.com) offers edgier designs.
 Acoustic wall carpet: It can cut down on noise. Some people choose to
cover half the wall (either the top or bottom) so they can decorate the rest.
 Paneling: Whether you use rustic, barely finished boards or gleaming
mahogany wainscoting, you can’t go wrong with wood. It gives your bar
a cozy, warm feeling that makes people want to stay.
 Brick: Exposed brick is a great way to bring in an older, traditional feel to
the bar. If you don’t have the luxury of a location that already has brick,
you can cover your walls (or even a single wall) to make it look like brick.
 Faux finishes: Using paint, you can create the look of aged Venetian 
plaster, fibers, or a window to an imaginary courtyard.
After you put all that work into choosing your wall treatment, you’re probably
going to want to cover it up with signs or pictures or trinkets. This, however,
doesn’t have to cost you any money. Hurray!
Many (if not all) beer and liquor companies have bar signs, clocks, neon
signs, and artwork for free. Ask your rep!
You can also ask your customers for items from their companies. (The 21
Club in New York became very famous not only as a fine restaurant and a
one-time speakeasy, but for taking the trucks and toys different patrons had
given them and hanging them from the ceiling.) You will be surprised by how
willing your customers are to give you things for the bar. So ask them already!
Other ideas would be to have a theme, like the most clocks on the wall in
North America, signed sports memorabilia, collectible mugs, bobble heads,
or movie posters. Start a bottle collection, or have the best of something.
Anything to have people say, “Did you see the stuff at Your Place?” which
leads to, “Have you had the ––– at Your Place?”

Fun and Games: TVs, Video Games, 
Pool Tables, and More
Let us entertain you! Like it or not, you’re in the entertainment business, and
the more ways you can entertain customers — and let them escape their
daily lives — the better. Popular choices for entertainment include television,
video games, and more traditional games like pool tables and shuffleboard.
It’s not necessary to have all of these choices, but a couple could help. Not
everyone likes to talk; some customers like to play. Entertainment keeps
patrons in your bar, and the longer they stay, the more they drink. Choose
the best diversions to make the most of your bar.
Tuning in with TVs and programming
You have to decide how many televisions your bar needs based on your goals
for your bar. If your bar serves as the local watering hole and you just want 
to keep a news channel on in the background, one smaller model is probably
okay (but make sure people can still make out the images from a few yards
away). But if you’re opening a sports bar and will be showing the weekend’s
hottest sporting events, you’ll need a couple of larger screens.
Many different types of TVs are available, including high-definition, diagonal,
flat panel, projection, tube, and combo. The technology changes every year,
and the prices keep coming down. Make sure the model you choose can
accommodate components such as sound systems, satellite receivers, video
games, and interactive bar games (check out the “Video and interactive
games” section later in this chapter for more on these).
As you’re researching the hundreds of models on the market, talk to an
expert at your local appliance store. He can recommend a quality brand that
will serve your needs. When it’s time to have your TVs installed, make sure
your installer is experienced, can hook up all the components, and is avail-
able for repairs.
Picking the right spot and installing the TV
You can put a TV just about anywhere these days. In most cases, choose high
locations, at standing eye level or higher, so that most patrons can see the
TVs. When it’s time to choose the location for the TV, mark a spot and then
walk around and make sure there aren’t too many blind spots (areas blocked
by poles or supporting beams). If most patrons won’t be able to see the
screen, choose a different location.
98
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

You have a couple of options when it comes to installing televisions:
 Flush mount to the wall: This option is popular for flat-panel plasma 
or LCD TVs. An experienced technician can hide all the wires and 
components for a clean, sophisticated look.
 Mounting brackets: You can find ceiling and wall mounts, and even
corner brackets, to match your location. Look for a unit that swivels 
so you can reposition the TV as you need to.
 Cabinets: You may prefer the look of cabinets or shelving to hold your
TV. Make sure you measure your TV (both the size and weight) to get
furniture that will work for your equipment.
Keep the remote behind the bar, otherwise the only time you’ll ever see it 
is when you first program the TV’s settings. Only one person should be in
charge of the remote: the bartender or the manager.
Signals from outer space: Satellite systems
Depending on what type of bar you’re running, you may want to get a satellite
TV system. These systems are great because you can get all kinds of sporting
events you can’t get with regular cable television. Say you want to watch
Finnish curling. Satellite has it. And it also has music channels for whatever
fits your mood.
With a satellite system, you need a separate receiver for each TV if you want
to show different programs at the same time.
The big names in satellite systems are
 DirecTV For Business (www.directv.com, click on the “DirecTV for
Business” link in the upper right-hand corner): DirecTV’s big draw for 
bars is its NFL Sunday Ticket (which gives you every NFL game no matter
where it’s played) and Mega March Madness (its exclusive coverage of the
NCAA Basketball tournament). The company offers XM satellite music
commercial-free for businesses.
 Dish Network (http://commercial.dishnetwork.com): This 
company also has lots of sports programming, such as MLS Direct Kick
(soccer) and ESPN Full Court (basketball). It offers Sirius satellite music.
Make sure you purchase a license to broadcast the programming in your bar
or you could get into legal trouble. Also, read the fine print before you sell
tickets to patrons to watch a premium event like a pay-per-view fight to make
sure you’re complying with all the requirements.

Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

Considering games for your bar
Games are extremely popular pastimes for bar patrons. Most require you to
purchase or lease some equipment. When you have games in your bar, you
can sponsor tournaments. Just think of all those people penciling in game
night at your bar on their weekly calendar. We hear the cash register ringing
already!
Traditional live bar games
The first recorded incident of playing pool in an American tavern occurred in
1775. But experts agree that earlier versions appeared in the British colonies,
in what’s now the United States, in the 1600s. These early games were based
on European games, and the first incident of what most Americans play
today, commonly known as “Eight Ball,” occurred in the early 1900s. Darts
made itself a bar mainstay in the early 1900s as well, after the king and queen
of England were spotted tossing a few on a tour of a local pub.
Everyone wants to be the best at something, and these games are meant for
competition and fun. Many places have contests for the best dart player, pool
player, and so forth. Give out prizes and trophies; these help build bigger and
better crowds.
Here’s a list of popular bar games, along with suggestions for where to look
for more information:
 Darts: You can choose several dart options, from the traditional, 
self-healing boards with live (and sharp) darts to the electronic dart
machines with blunt tips that can injure only a few people. Ask your
liquor rep about getting a dartboard; many of the scotch companies 
have quality sets. And check out the National Dart Association (www.
ndadarts.com) or Planet Darts (http://planetdarts.com) for 
information on game play or setting up a league.
 Pool: Pool (also called billiards) is and will always be one of the 
number-one games in bars. The American Poolplayers Association
(www.poolplayers.com) is the final word on rules and organizes 
tournaments. You can choose a pool table from a local game-supply
store or one of these companies:
• Aramith/Preciball: www.saluc.com
• Bumper Tube: www.bumpertube.com
 Table shuffleboard: Table shuffleboard is similar to its cruise ship
cousin in that players push a weight along a game board hoping to 
slide it to its target. Another great tournament choice. Check out
eShuffleboard.com (www.eshuffleboard.com), which includes links
for buying a shuffleboard table, and the Table Shuffleboard Association
(www.tableshuffleboard.org) for more information.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

 Pinball: It’s a classic game of skill beloved by many. More important to
you, pinball machines are a great source of revenue. Check these sites
for a quality machine:
• American Vending Sales: http://americanvending.com
• Fun Merchandise: www.funmerchandise.com
• The Pinball Factory: www.pinball.com
• Pinball Sales: www.pinballsales.com
• Stern Pinball: www.sternpinball.com
Video and interactive games
Whether it’s electronic casino games, like blackjack or Texas Hold’em, trivia,
play-along sports games, or video games, more patrons are testing their skills
and knowledge in bars than ever before. In fact, some bars, like Dave and
Buster’s or Great American Midway, built their concept around games for
adults. And remember, the more they play, the longer they stay.
If you think you want to offer some of the national, interactive games, check
out NTN Buzztime. NTN broadcasts live, interactive entertainment through
its Buzztime Network to more than 4,000 bars and restaurants across the
United States. Players can compete for points, rankings, and prizes. Contact
them by calling 888-752-9686, e-mailing sales@ntn.com, or visiting their
Web site at www.ntn.com.
If your patrons would rather play traditional arcade games, you can cater to
their needs. Choose free-standing video games with the classics like Pacman,
Galaga, Centipede, or Mario Brothers. You can also get an Arcade Legends
game with 50 classic games in one machine; then you don’t have to narrow
down your choices. Or go with something more au courant like Police Trainer,
Golden Tee Golf, or Big Buck Hunter.
You can also choose video-game systems (like Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) to
hook to your TVs. You can’t set them up to be a pay-to-play system (yet!), but
you can provide them as a service to your clients.
If your machines don’t take bills, consider getting a change machine. It will
save your bartenders and waitstaff some time and headaches.
As with just about any other equipment for your bar, you can lease game
equipment and jukeboxes (See “Getting your jukebox,” later in this chapter,
for more details). If you buy it, you own it forever, keeping all the profits. But
you’ll pay a high hourly repair rate if the equipment breaks down. Leasing
ensures that the leasing company takes care of all repairs and maintenance,
while you split the revenue fifty-fifty. Plus, you can switch leased machines
out with other games if your customers get bored.

Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

Music, Professor! Jukeboxes, 
DJs, and Live Tunes
Music is the final piece in setting the tone for your bar. A jukebox is a great
choice to allow people to play what they want to hear when they want to
hear it. You can also get live music, such as bands, DJs, and karaoke systems,
for special occasions. This section gets you started.
It is not absolutely necessary to have music in your bar, but if you choose 
to have it, do it right. Ask your customers what they want to hear. Ask
employees what kind of music is hot in the area. See how their ideas 
match your ideas for your bar.
Getting your jukebox
A jukebox is a bar standard (not to mention a great revenue stream). Even 
if you’re going to have other music options, you probably need a jukebox. 
If you’ve been in a bar lately (and man, we really hope you have), you have
probably seen the two basic styles available, a CD jukebox and a digital 
jukebox. The CD jukebox holds complete CDs of music. The digital variety
updates its playlist using the Internet and offers new tunes to your patrons
regularly. They are constantly being updated.
When installing your jukebox, make sure that the volume and on/off 
switches are located behind the bar or in a closet that only certain people
can access. Also make sure you have some tokens or slugs that you can use
to start some music.
Consider using a great patriotic song to play during last call (the magical
moment that signals the last opportunity for a patron to order a drink for 
the evening). The song should get everyone’s attention, and then you can
turn up the volume to ensure your customers know it’s closing time.
Here’s how to find a local distributor for these specific brands:
 NSM Jukeboxes: www.bmigaming.com
 Rock Ola: www.rock-ola.com
 Rowe International: www.roweinternational.com/distributor_
network.html
 Wurlitzer: www.deutsche-wurlitzerusa.com
102
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Wurlitzer just launched its CD/iPod jukebox that holds 100 CDs and
hooks to an iPod to offer up another 60GB of space (approximately
10,000 songs). The company also has a jukebox that plays old vinyl
records. (For those of you who may not know, records are what we
played before CDs. Hard to imagine, we know.)
Check out your Yellow Pages for listings under “Vending” and “Amusement.”
Many of these companies offer all things coin-operated, including jukeboxes
and video games.
Finding and signing live performers
In most cases, performers will find you as soon as they hear that a new bar 
is opening. Talk to other bar owners to see who the biggest draw is.
Naturally, you should audition performers or go hear them sing at someone
else’s bar. Before you hire, tell them the rules:
 Specify how many breaks they should take. For example, maybe you
agree to one 15-minute break every hour. Your call.
 Agree to discounts on the price of their drinks and the limit for the dis-
count. Identify who qualifies for the discount as well. You may want only
band members to get the discount, rather than girlfriends, boyfriends, or
family members. You may not have to give them a discount at all, or you
can take the bar tab out of what you pay the band.
 Develop a groupies policy. You do not want your bar full of groupies
who buy one drink and sit there all night. You lose customers and 
possibly your bartender if it continues.
 Determine your free or discounted meals policy. Identify who you feed
and the price they pay.
 Approve the set list. You need to make sure that their song choices
appeal to your patrons. (Remember the original Blues Brothers movie,
“We play both kinds of music: country and western.”)
 Negotiate the cost to you. Some bands set a cover charge (an admission
price that patrons pay to hear the band play) and keep it. Others split 
the cover charge with bar owners and take a percentage of sales. Others
simply get a flat fee for performing for a certain amount of time. Figure out
what the plan is before you’re slapped with a bill at the end of a long night.
You can even have amateur or open-mike night at your place if you want
some live entertainment but don’t want to pay a lot. You may or may not
have a lot of patrons participate, but remember: You get what you pay for.

Chapter 6: Selecting Your Bar’s Site, Décor, and Name

Hiring a DJ or karaoke company
A DJ or a karaoke company is basically a live performer, so all the rules for
bands in the previous section apply here. Lay down the ground rules ahead
of time.
You can hire your very own DJ to play the latest rock, rap, or country hits for
your place. Having your own DJ is cheaper in the long run than hiring an out-
side company to come in and entertain the crowd every weekend. You can
also have a guest DJ once a week. The best bet is to have a DJ on one of your
slow nights and, of course, Fridays and Saturdays. These resources can help
get you started:
 ProSound: www.pssl.com
 Rock and Soul: www.rockandsoul.com
 Top DJ Gear: www.topdjgear.com
If you want to buy your own karaoke equipment, here are some places to look:
 Ace Karaoke: www.acekaraoke.com
 Cheap Karaoke: www.cheapkaraoke.com
 Karaoke Now: www.karaokenow.com
You may save yourself some money, but you have to have someone to run
the equipment for you. Even a karaoke night needs an emcee of some sort.
You can hire this out at first while you’re getting your place going, and then
hire a part-time person to act as a DJ or emcee on designated nights.

Stocking Up on Smallwares
and Equipment
In This Chapter
 Getting your bar equipment together
 Checking out kitchen appliances
 Selecting your smallwares
 Setting up your table
 Looking at equipment financing options
T
he wide, wide world of bar equipment can be overwhelming. Trying to
figure out what you need, where you need to put it, and whom to get it
from can be a daunting task.
You’re only as good as the tools and employees you have. Hire good people,
you get great workers. Buy good equipment with good warranties, you have
less trouble (and trouble will find you in this business — you won’t have to
look for it). Take your time and shop around for all your equipment. Buy
quality tools and appliances once, and you won’t have to fix them or take
them back.
This chapter is here to help. We show you what you need (and don’t need).
We help you figure out how to pay for it. And we give you tips on how to put
it all together without breaking your budget.
Picking Out Your Bar Equipment
In this section, we cover everything from glassware and shakers to
smallwares — those little, necessary things that every bar needs, like

serving ware and linens. We help you figure out which items you need 
(and more importantly, which ones you don’t) to get your bar stocked
the right way.
Getting your glassware
You could spend a fortune in terms of dollars and storage space to keep a
slew of glasses for every occasion. Customers expect cocktails and drinks to
be served in specific glasses. Although that’s all well and good, we recom-
mend you keep it simple. And how much you’ll spend depends on the style of
glasses, size, price, number, and so on.
Here are the glasses you really need (check out Figure 7-1 to get a better idea
of what each one looks like):
 Shot glass: You serve, um, shots in these. Some people also use them to
measure liquor for cocktails.
 Wine glass: Choose an all-purpose wine glass for both red and white
wine, rather than one for each type. Most people choose a 5- or 8-ounce
size. In a pinch, you can also use wine glasses to serve drinks that you’d
normally serve in a rocks, highball, or collins glass. Of course, if you
plan to run a wine bar, invest in a variety of glasses to match the variety
of wines you serve. Your customers will expect nothing less.
 Rocks glass: Drinks served on the rocks, or with ice, like martinis and
manhattans, are often served in these glasses. Some people call them
old-fashioned glasses, not because they’re not hip, but because a cock-
tail of the same name is served in them. Use the 5- or 6-ounce variety.
 Highball and collins glasses: You can choose one or the other, depend-
ing on your preference. Use them to make popular drinks, such as a
Bloody Mary or Tom Collins, and cocktails ordered tall (or served in a
taller glass containing the same amount of alcohol, but with extra
mixers). We recommend a 10- to 12-ounce glass.
 Martini glass: The age of the cocktail is back in full swing. You definitely
need many martini glasses, specially because 40 percent of cocktails are
called martinis. Don’t buy really large martini glasses unless martinis are
going to be your specialty cocktail. Stick with a 4- or 5-ounce size.
Only serve martinis in martini glasses if you serve them up, or without
ice. Ice in a martini glass is awkward, so serve martinis on the rocks in a
rocks glass, detailed earlier in this list.
106
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

 Beer glass: The most common choices are pint glass (either 16- or 20-
ounce), pilsner, mug, or beer glass. Ask your beer distributor for good
buys. Fancier choices include the tulip and wheat beer glasses. If you’re
going to be known for your beers (especially draft beer), consider
investing in a few different types to match your styles of beer. Check
out Chapter 12 for more information on different styles of beer.
Consider carrying two sizes of beer glasses, say a pint (16-ounce) glass
and a 10- or 12-ounce glass or mug. You can offer draft beers at two dif-
ferent price points, offering a better value to the customer who chooses
the more expensive pour.
 Coffee glass/mug: Many bars use your average, everyday coffee mugs
for coffee drinks, but some invest in special mugs to differentiate coffee
from coffee cocktails. Choose what fits your budget and your bar.
Do not buy any glasses unless you have a rack to wash them in. We repeat:
Do not buy any glasses unless you have a rack to wash them in. You should
be able to buy racks from the same company you buy your glasses from.
Without the proper rack, glassware can and will get broken in the dish
machine. If yours is a busy bar, don’t try to rely on just an in-sink washing
unit to do the job. You need to be able to wash racks of glasses at a time in
the machine in the kitchen. You can also use the racks to store the glasses.
If you really want to get fancy (and your budget and glass storage space
allows), add a few other stems to your glassware entourage, like these:
 Snifter: This glass is reserved for cognac and brandy.
 Champagne: Two styles are available (flute and saucer), but the flute is
more common these days.
 Margarita: Many versions of this glass are currently available from very
rustic, hand-blown versions, to elegantly simple ones that resemble
champagne saucers.
 Cordial: A cordial glass can be used to serve cordials, layered shots,
port, or anything else served in small, but potent quantities.
Touching on basic bar tools

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

If you stumble on used versions of these supplies and they appear to be
in good condition, go ahead and buy them. Don’t spend your time looking 
for used ones though, because the small savings you get isn’t really worth
the time.
 Bar rail and service mats: A bar rail mat is a long, narrow rubber mat
that lies on the edge of the bar. Bartenders place in-progress cocktails
on them as they pour, mix, and garnish drinks. The mats catch small
spills and clean easily as you run them through the dishwasher. Service
mats are thin, rubberized mats placed on the service bar counter, where
bartenders place completed drinks ordered by waitstaff.
If you don’t mind doing a little advertising for the liquor companies,
you often can get these mats, as well as bar towels, mirrors, beverage
napkins, straw holders, garnish caddies, glass rimmers, cork screws,
and water pitchers, for free from your liquor rep. Because every com-
pany will offer you something, take the items and put the extras in your
storeroom.
 Bar spoon: This is simply a long spoon for stirring cocktails, shown in
Figure 7-2. Keep these handy so bartenders aren’t tempted to use their
fingers.

 Bottle openers: Choose wall-mounted (with a catcher) or handheld
openers to open beer bottles quickly. Take a look at Figure 7-3 for a few
different options.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

A waiter’s wine opener, pictured in Figure 7-8, can also be used to open
beer bottles, but it’s not nearly as fast as either a flat or wall-mounted
opener. Choose wisely, grasshopper.
 Garnish caddy: A garnish caddy is a divided tray that holds several dif-
ferent types of garnishes, such as lime wedges, olives, and onions. Take
a look at Figure 7-4 to see an example of a garnish caddy.
 Glass rimmer: This tool helps you add decorative and tasty garnishes to
the rim of your cocktail glasses. Take a look at the device in Figure 7-2.
 Ice bucket: You need at least one large plastic bucket to carry ice from
the ice machine in the kitchen out to the bar to restock your wells.
Consider using the rolling version if you can because these large 
buckets (5 gallons or more) get heavy. You can save some strain 
on your champagne company if you buy a couple of cases of their 
champagne.
Only use this ice bucket for ice. Label it in big bold letters ICE ONLY
and store it near the ice machine. After you put trash, food, or any-
thing else in the bucket, it’s no longer suitable for ice, even if you
clean and sanitize it. Foreign items impart an unpleasant smell and 
flavor to ice long afterward. The bucket will never be quite clean
enough again.
Figure 7-4:

Chapter 7: Stocking Up on Smallwares and Equipment

 Ice scoop: We highly recommend metal or plastic scoops. You can run
them through the dish machine to sanitize them thoroughly and often.
You can see one in Figure 7-2.
Never, ever use your hands, a glass, or anything other than a proper
scoop to scoop ice. It contaminates the ice, making it unusable for serv-
ing to customers.
If you break this rule (shame on you!), you could break a glass in the ice
or spread germs to your patrons. After you (or more likely someone who
works for you because you are reading this warning) commit this griev-
ous sin, you must burn the ice well (Melt the ice with hot water, remove
any foreign objects, thoroughly sanitize the well, and restock with ice.)
before it can be used again.
 Jigger: A jigger is a metal, double-ended measuring cup. Typically it mea-
sures 1⁄2 ounce on one end, and 2 ounces on the other. Check it out in
Figure 7-2.
 Knives and cutting board: We recommend that you keep at least one
sharp paring knife and a cutting board behind the bar specifically for
cutting garnishes. It’s best to have one set for your bar and one set for
your kitchen (if you’re serving food) so they’re handy when you need
them. We recommend a hard-plastic cutting board that can be sanitized
easily and run through your dish machine.
 Muddler: Use this small wooden bat or pestle to muddle, or crush, herbs
and fruit (like mint and limes for Mojitos) for cocktails. Treat this
wooden tool as you would a wooden cutting board or wooden spoon.
Hand wash only! Take a look at this tool in Figure 7-2.
 Pourers: These plastic pitchers are handy if you don’t have juice on
your soda guns. Keep backups of OJ, Bloody Mary mix, and cranberry
juice handy in these in the reach-in cooler behind the bar. Take a look at
pourers in Figure 7-5.
 Shakers: These must-have tools let you thoroughly mix cocktails and give
them a little foam. Most bartenders use one of two basic styles of shakers:
Boston shaker: These shakers have a glass piece and a tin piece.
The roughly 16-ounce glass fits into the tin, which is shaped like a
cone, and you shake the drink. Never ever pound the tin against
the bar. If the pieces get stuck, run the shaker under hot water and
slowly work the parts apart. The Boston shaker also comes in a
shorter size with just the metal part, and this usually fits over the
glass you serve the drink in. Shake with ice, pull the shaker apart
from the glass, and serve the cocktail on the rocks in the glass.
Standard cocktail shaker: These shakers usually have a tight top
and a strainer that is fitted onto the bottom half. They come in
many types of designs. Some, but not many, bars use them. If they
do, they are usually only for display. There must be at least 1,000
different styles, from planes to birds, and they make great collector
items. (Ray has more than 300 different ones.)
112
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

 Sinks: You need a few sinks behind the bar — three to set up a dish-
washing system (see the “Acquiring Bar Appliances” section, later in this
chapter, for details) and a fourth exclusively for hand washing.
 Soda gun system: Your soda gun connects to your bag-in-the-box (BIB)
system. Soda syrup is mixed on demand with soda as the bartender
makes the cocktail.
 Speed rails: Speed rails are metal trays that hold many of the commonly
poured liquors. Many bars use speed rails, in addition to their wells, to
keep more liquors within reach. Speed rails are usually set up on the
opposite side of the bar and in the area where most cocktails are made.
They are either attached or hung on the sink portion of the bar, near the
ice bins. Speed rails contain items that are usually called for, such as
vodka, gin, scotch, bourbon, or whatever is the most called-for item at
your place. Your bartender will decide which brands or category to
place in the rails.
 Strainers: Strainers are handy if you serve cocktails up, or without ice
(some people say “straight up” for added effect, but the words mean the
same thing). Check out Figure 7-6 for the ever-popular Hawthorn
strainer. Some shakers include their own strainers, but we prefer the
Hawthorn because it’s the original. Color us sentimental. To use the
Hawthorn, just place the strainer over the end of the shaker containing
your shaken cocktail with the coil facing into the shaker. Pour the drink
into your serving glass, through the strainer, and catch the ice.

 Wells: A well is a dedicated area where (usually) a single bartender
works to make drinks. A well should have liquor, ice, garnishes, mixers
(often in the form of a soda gun), and easy access to glassware. Check
out Figure 7-7 to see how a well could be laid out.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

 Wine buckets: You only need wine buckets if you’re serving bottles of
white wine and champagne that you want to keep chilled at the patron’s
table. If you’re selling wine by the glass only, you can skip this particular
tool. Wine buckets come in metal or plastic, and you may be able to
secure a couple from your wine salesperson when you order wine or
champagne. You can also buy them wherever you get smallwares. If
you buy them, get a couple of stands to hold the buckets, rather than
put the bucket on the table. Three buckets is probably enough, depend-
ing on the size of your wine/champagne business.
 Wine openers: Wine openers come in many varieties these days. If you
serve a lot of wine, consider getting a counter-mounted version. If you
only have the occasional oenophile (or wine lover), a pocket-sized ver-
sion like the waiter wine key will do you just fine. Take a look at them
both in Figure 7-8.
Stocking up on smallwares
Smallwares describes all the small stuff in the bar, such as knives, forks,
plates, ramekins, and paper goods. They aren’t terribly exciting, but they’re
necessary.
Flatware
Flatware can be purchased in five-piece settings: dinner fork, salad fork, knife,
tablespoon, and teaspoon. You can add other pieces, such as a fish fork,
butter knife, and steak knife, if you need them. It’s becoming more common
to just provide two regular-sized forks, rather than a standard fork and a
smaller salad fork. Choose which plan works better for you.
Figure 7-8:
Examples of
wine
openers.
115
Chapter 7: Stocking Up on Smallwares and Equipment

Dishware
The category of dishware typically includes plates, platters (particularly
good if you serve multiple items on the same plate), soup bowls, and bread-
and-butter plates. Choose a basic commercial pattern for your dishware.
Look for sturdy and functional. And make sure you can easily get pieces to
match because items will get broken.
Ramekins (they look like small bowls) are handy for serving sides and condi-
ments to your patrons if you serve food in your bar. You can also use them
to bring extra garnishes for that patron who needs ten cherries for his
Amaretto Sour.
Linens
Linens include things like towels, tablecloths, napkins, and even kitchen
uniforms. You can buy or rent your linens. Most restaurants rent them. Bars
are split.
 If you buy, make sure the linens are all made from fabrics that are wash
and wear or wash and use. Make sure you have a washer and dryer on
site to get these ready for the next day. This really will save you money if
you can do it yourself.
 If you rent, keep a good inventory and inspect everything. Do not
accept tablecloths or napkins that are frayed or have holes in them! If
you rent your linens, check them in and check them out. Create a note-
book with a list of all the linens you use, how many of each you rent, and
the dates in and out. This way, you will know where your linens are and
how much is going bye-bye.
Don’t let your staff leave with linens you own or rent. In particular, uniform
pieces, such as chef coats, seem to disappear if you don’t set up a firm policy
on placing them in the dirty linen bin or hanging them back up in employees’
lockers after use.
Avoid linen abuse. It’s not just a cleanliness issue, it’s also a cost issue
because you have to pay to wash a napkin that’s been used. It seems small,
but it adds up quickly! Post signs prohibiting linen abuse:
1. Do not wipe floors with linens.
2. Do not shine shoes with napkins.
3. Please do not abuse linens.
Signed by Ray Foley, Linen Police
116
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Miscellaneous supplies
You need just a few more items for your bar that don’t fit neatly into any of
these categories.
 Ashtrays, assuming you can still smoke in bars in your state
 Trashcans with extra liners (bar lingo for trash bags)
 Pens and pencils
 Telephone books and a diary for behind the bar (See Chapter 18 for tips
on using a diary effectively.)
 Extra pitchers for juice and water
 Floor mats to cushion feet, knees, and backs, and to reduce the danger
of slipping
 Straws and stirrers
 Cocktail napkins, sometimes called bevnaps
Stocking the table
Most tables have something on them when a customer sits down. Maybe
you have a table tent with your beer selection listed, a drink menu, salt and
pepper shakers, or other items people will need when enjoying your estab-
lishment. Ultimately, the table size and your idea of what’s important will
determine what you place on the table. If you serve a lot of burgers, consider
keeping things like ketchup and mustard on the table, within easy reach. If
you don’t, you can probably bring it as needed, saving table space.
Just to clear up a bit of jargon confusion, the items discussed here are defi-
nitely not smallwares (see the previous section). The actual vessels (salt and
pepper shaker) might be, but once they’re filled and out in the dining room,
they move into the category of table stock. Items like Worcestershire and hot
sauce aren’t smallwares in any sense.
When stocking your table, remember to leave room for drinks and food. Do not
overcrowd your patrons. They want somewhere to put purses, cellphones,
planners, laptops, and other necessities.
You’ll need to place these items on the table:
 Salt and pepper shakers
 Flower arrangement or centerpiece (a candle, for example)
 Maybe one table tent listing house specials
117
Chapter 7: Stocking Up on Smallwares and Equipment

Place other items in the waiter station, including these oft-used ones:
 Ketchup
 Mustard
 Hot sauce
 Worcestershire sauce
 Peppermills
 Sugar and sweetener (for coffee and tea)
 Creamer
When the kitchen closes, take all of these items off the tables and put them in
the waiter station or you will lose them!
Acquiring Bar Appliances
In this section, we cover appliances, which are pretty much bar tools with a
plug. Quite a distinction, we know. If you need help figuring out where to get
this stuff, take a look at the section “Leasing versus Buying, New versus
Used,” later in this chapter.
Here’s a list of appliances you need for your bar:
 Blender: Most bars do have blenders, even though bartenders like to hide
them. Because you will get patrons who want frozen daiquiris, margaritas,
Piña Coladas, and other frozen cocktails, you need a good-quality com-
mercial blender with some kind of warranty. Check it out in Figure 7-3.
The most popular bar blender brands are Vita-Mix (www.vitamix.com),
Hamilton Beach (www.hamiltonbeach.com), and Waring Blenders
(www.waringproducts.com).
 Coolers: No, we do not mean that you should put the heavy-duty plastic,
tailgating toy box behind your bar. The term cooler actually refers to a
refrigerator in bar-speak. You can find a variety of sizes to fit in different
spots behind your bar and in your kitchen.
• Reach-in coolers are small coolers, roughly the size of a dorm or
under-the-desk fridge. Bartenders reach in to get what they need
out of them. Highboy coolers are reach-in coolers situated about
118
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

waist level, maybe on top of a counter. Lowboy coolers fit under
the counter. Bartenders keep backup garnishes, bottled beer, 
juice, and other perishables they need regularly in these small 
coolers.
• Beer coolers are large, chest coolers below the bar top. The door is
located on top of the chest, and it slides open, allowing easy access
to quick-selling beers.
• Many bars also have walk-in coolers in or near the kitchen.
Commonly known as walk-ins, these refrigerated rooms allow
staff members to walk into them. You can store large, perishable
items such as kegs, cases of beer, or a flat of salad greens in your
walk-in. Typically, bartenders move what they need from the walk-
ins to the reach-in before their shifts start to keep things handy.
 Ice machine: Making great drinks requires using great ice. And great ice
requires a water purification system and a quality ice maker.
 Smoke eaters: These commercial clean-air systems are a must in any bar
or tavern that has a smoking section or allows smoking at the bar. See
www.smokeeaters.org on the Web or call 1-877-688-2703 for more
information.
 Submersible dishwasher: This dishwashing unit is standard in a restau-
rant, but it’s typically a backup appliance in a bar. A submersible dish-
washer is only for glassware. It usually fills the first of a three-sink system.
The first sink is for washing (or gently rubbing the glasses around on the
rotating brushes). The second sink is for rinsing the soap off the glasses.
The last sink contains sanitizer to dip the glasses in to kill off any lingering
germs.
Selecting Kitchen Appliances
Your menu really dictates what appliances you need (or more accurately,
your appliances determine what foods you can serve). Unless you’re intent
on making food a top priority at your bar, your menu should really take
advantage of basic kitchen equipment. Take a look at Chapter 9 for tips on
how to get your menu and your kitchen totally in synch.
Keep handy a list of electricians and mechanics in your area. The longer your
equipment is down, the more money you’re losing. It’s important, very impor-
tant, to keep everything in working order.
119
Chapter 7: Stocking Up on Smallwares and Equipment

The next section, “Leasing versus Buying, New versus Used,” addresses
where to find appliances, how to pay for them, and things to watch out for.
Here we cover the basics of what kinds of equipment most bars use, but your
list may vary:
 Grills: These are a staple in any bar that serves food, which is why so
many call themselves “Bar and Grill.” You can cook many different
things, from burgers to steaks, or even eggs and bacon. Choose both a
flattop grill (like a big skillet) and a grated grill (with an open flame) if you
have the money and space. You can easily use them both.
Grills are good candidates for buying used, especially if they’re gas.
 Broilers: These appliances are fairly versatile and come in many sizes.
The large size can be used for things like steaks and chops. A smaller
version is handy for quickly melting cheese on soup, nachos, and open-
faced sandwiches.
 Ovens: You’ll need one of these if you plan to serve anything that can’t be
prepared on the grill or broiler. Here are the varieties you might consider:
• Convection: Circulates air around food. Best for quick and even
cooking.
• Conveyer: Heats and cooks top and bottom. Great for sandwiches,
burgers, and pizza.
• Microwave: Great for reheating and cooking quick items.
 Dish machine: Every bar must have one of these. They are beyond
essential. In the bar business, most of your washing will take the form of
racks of glassware, rather than stockpots and skillets. Enter the com-
mercial dish machine, complete with crazy-quick sanitizing cycles.
 Sinks: You’ll need a hand sink for almost every station. Buy the best
and have them installed by a great plumber. Check with your local board
of health for requirements on what supplies should be stocked near a
hand sink.
 Grease traps or interceptors: These are passive devices required by
municipalities to stop grease, fat, oil, wax, or debris from entering the
city’s sanitary sewer system.
Leasing versus Buying, New versus Used
Coming up with the cash to buy an entire kitchen and bar full of brand-new
equipment isn’t easy. Many owners opt to look into other options like leasing
or buying used equipment, instead of going with brand-new stuff. In this
120
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

section, we help you work your way through the process of getting the equip-
ment you need, and also alert you to the pros and cons of leasing and buying,
and then deciding to go with new or used equipment.
Don’t forget to discuss your options for buying and leasing equipment
with your banker and accountant. They have the information about your
particular financial situation that can help you make the best decision for
your bar.
Looking at leasing
Leasing isn’t just for cars these days. Often companies lease equipment for
a set period of time and fully maintain the machine during your lease term.
After the term of the lease is over, you can choose to renew the lease, but
typically you get a brand-new machine to use during the lease period. It can
be an ideal situation for many owners.
Here are a few of the brighter points of leasing equipment:
 Your cash isn’t tied up in equipment. By leasing, you have money for
working capital and cash flow.
 Zero repair costs (assuming maintenance and repair costs are included
in the contract)
 No out-of-date equipment. You lease new equipment. When your lease
expires, you get to sign a new lease for new equipment. Leasing lets
you upgrade your equipment to newer appliances with the latest bells
and whistles, so you don’t own the same, behind-the-times oven for
10 years.
 Tax breaks! Leasing also may be fully tax deductible as an operating
expense. (Check with your accountant.)
 More variety of types of equipment. You can lease almost any type of
equipment that you need, and you can have more equipment because
you’re not tying up your cash.
The biggest downside to leasing is that you don’t own the equipment. You
continue to make payments indefinitely. You can buy some of these appli-
ances used at a very good price. Over time, you can save a lot more money
by buying used equipment, even when you factor in maintenance costs.
Check out the section “Evaluating used equipment,” later in this chapter, for
tips on what to look for in used equipment.
121
Chapter 7: Stocking Up on Smallwares and Equipment

In our opinion, leasing is a good option for ice machines and coolers, and
dishwashers and coffeemakers in particular. In the case of coffeemakers and
dishwashers, many times the company will give you the machine if you buy
the accompanying product (coffee and detergent) from them.
Negotiating for new equipment
The greatest thing about new equipment is that it’s, well, new. No one has
dropped it, dented it, or otherwise abused it . . . yet. The best thing to arm
yourself with when looking at new equipment is information. Do your com-
parison shopping. Know your prices and be ready to negotiate. List price is
for wimps!
Know the answers to these questions before you buy your first piece of
equipment:
 What equipment do I need for my bar? Think about the front of the
house and the back of the house. We included extensive lists of items
throughout this chapter that you need to consider buying for your bar.
 Who can I buy this from in my area? Create a list of restaurant supply
houses, salespeople, other people in the business, and anyone who can
get you in touch with potential suppliers.
 What do these items cost new and used? Create a spreadsheet to keep
track of prices of comparable items.
Answering these questions before you buy can help you know if you’re get-
ting a good deal or being taken for a ride.
When buying new equipment, check all warranties. If you can, buy a service
agreement. Make sure the agreement specifies how long it will take for a
repairperson to get to your place. This timeline can vary greatly. Does the
company guarantee repairs within four hours, a day, or a week? If they
can’t repair the appliance in three hours or less, you could be losing serious
money.
Evaluating used equipment
You can save between 40 and 60 percent of your equipment budget by buying
used equipment. But it’s only a savings if you don’t spend a ton in mainte-
nance and repairs. Voilà! The balancing act begins. We recommend taking
122
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

an electrician and mechanic with you when buying used equipment. Consult
your local phone book and ask around for reliable contractors. Talk to the
town engineer, fire marshal, and local builders. Check with your employees
and the Chamber of Commerce.
Here’s what to do when looking at used equipment:
 Visually inspect the equipment. Missing knobs are usually OK. Warped
grill bottoms are not.
 Be wary of used electrical items. These items are more likely to have
problems than their gas counterparts, especially if they’re not maintained
well. Always have an electrician with you to check out anything electrical
that he may have to repair. He should advise you about appliances that
are beyond repair or always need repair.
 Get written guarantees. You shouldn’t expect to get a long time period
guaranteed, but you need some assurance that if the appliance stops
running next week, you can return it.
 Factor moving and installation costs into the total price. After you figure
in these costs, you may be better off buying new with free installation. It’s
now a matter of money. Is it cheaper to buy new and have it installed, or
buy used and pay to have it installed? Get out your pencil and paper and
add it up. Now make the decision.

Setting Up Your Bar’s Inventory
In This Chapter
 Creating a home for your inventory
 Knowing how much to stock
 Figuring out how much to keep on hand
K
nowing what to stock in your bar is sometimes truly a matter of trial
and error. (Sometimes more error than we’d like, but that’s another
story.) But you can start from an in-the-know place by browsing this chapter.
Here we give you some guidelines to help you figure out how many different
types of liquor, beer, and wine you actually need to carry to balance your 
customers’ wishes with your bottom line. And we also help you figure out
how much to buy and where to put it all.
Creating Your Storerooms
If you’re starting from the ground up, God bless you. Your bar needs to be
designed so that your storeroom (the place where you store extra supplies
until you need them) is convenient to every part of the house that needs it,
especially the kitchen and bar. You need two basic storerooms:
 Dry storage: Keep your canned goods, dry goods, linens, and cleaning
supplies here.
 Cold storage: Here’s where you store, um, cold stuff and perishable
stuff. It most commonly takes the form of a large refrigerated room, 
or a cooler.
If it’s at all possible, use two separate coolers, one for food items that
the kitchen staff has access to and another cooler that liquor is stored
in. The second cooler is for bartenders and managers only. It’s usually
full of expensive inventory, and you need a full accounting of when the
items leave and for what reason. If you can keep kitchen and bar stuff
separated, you’re a step ahead.

Depending on your menu, you may also need a freezer. Some places actually
have freezer rooms, but most bars have smaller, reach-in freezers stationed
underneath or beside the bar itself.
Make sure your storerooms are both out of the way and easily accessible.
You don’t want them taking up valuable seating or working areas.
Tracking your day-to-day inventory
You need to make an inventory sheet for both of your storerooms. An inventory
sheet shows who is taking what items when. Whenever someone takes some-
thing out of the storeroom, he or she marks down the time and date, item
taken, amount, and where the item will be used (bar, kitchen, bathrooms, and
so forth). Then the employee has to sign his or her name. This form should be
as easy to fill in as possible (and don’t forget to keep a pen nearby). Post the
sheet on the inside of the storeroom door.
This basic sheet is all you need for your dry storage area. You will need to
modify the inventory sheet for your cold storeroom. Add a line at the top of
the form that tells your employees that only a manager or bartender can take
items from the cold storage area. Limiting who has access to the cold storage
area helps you keep track of valuable products.
All items should be checked in and out.
Securing your inventory
You can’t keep an eye on everything all the time, so invest in a couple of good
locks for your storerooms. Locks keep honest people honest. When products
go missing, you’re hit with a double whammy: You lose the money you spent
on the item and the money you could have made on the item.
Keep your cooler locked unless someone is actually stocking or restocking it.
Do not allow everyone to have access to storage rooms. Limit the people 
who have keys or lock combinations to your managers, head cook, head 
bartender, and of course, you. When the bar is open, make sure someone 
has a key at all times. For more advice on preventing theft, see Chapter 14.
Extra keys should be placed in the safe. Always make sure that a set of keys is
available during each shift, or you won’t get backup supplies when you need
them. (Yes, this does happen.)
126
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Keeping Your Inventory Well Stocked
You must keep a backup of all the products you sell or products you need for
the kitchen and bar. This is called your inventory. If you run out, you’re 86 on
that item.
Keep your inventory — your entire inventory — in locked rooms. See the
“Securing your inventory” section, earlier in this chapter.
Make sure you take a long look at Chapter 14. It gives you tips for setting 
up ordering and purchasing procedures, maintaining your inventory, and
reducing waste to make your product dollars go further.
Stocking your drink items
Choosing what liquors to carry really can help you define your bar. The
brands you choose (and don’t choose) tell your patrons what kind of place
you run and help convey your bar’s atmosphere. For example, stocking 40
draft beers sends a different message than stocking 40 types of single malt
Scotches.
Stocking a true bar is a different process than stocking a restaurant bar.
Stand-alone bars have more brands and varieties of liquors than an average
restaurant bar.
Evaluate liquors to determine what fits best with your place. You definitely
want variety, but you want your products to move, too. Liquor that sits on a
shelf ties up cash, which is not good for your business.
Liquor
Well liquor is the most basic, least expensive type of liquor. It’s what your
bartender pours when someone orders a “gin and tonic” but doesn’t specify,
or call, a particular brand. Premium liquor is a step up from call liquor, and
super-premium is a step up again. For more about the differences between the
liquors, and pricing drinks accordingly, check out Chapter 9.
Some liquors come in more than one flavor. For example, other vodka flavors
are definitely available (like blueberry, melon, grapefruit, currant, cranberry,
strawberry, peach, watermelon, chocolate, coffee, coconut, grape, apple, cherry,
lime . . .). You have to be the judge (and your customers will be the jury!) of how
many you need and which ones to choose. If you’re looking to create a signature
Bloody Mary, consider Absolut Peppar. If you’re looking to create something like
a Bellini Martini, consider something like Stoli Persik (peach). All the big-name
vodka producers have many flavors available these days.

Chapter 8: Setting Up Your Bar’s Inventory

We strongly recommend that you evaluate your reasons for wanting more than
five flavors of a particular liquor. If you develop a special drink or drink menu
using flavored vodkas, definitely invest in them. But don’t keep a bottle of
Three Olives Green Watermelon Vodka around for the occasional Watermelon
Martini that someone may order. If you invest in a unique liquor, make sure you
promote it.
Whether you decide to go with well or premium liquors, Table 8-1 lists
liquors we think are essential to stock in your bar. We give you a general 
category of liquor, recommended quantities to keep at the bar and in inven-
tory, and a list of brand names to consider when choosing what to stock.
When it comes to choosing brands of well liquor for your bar, talk to your
liquor sales rep. He likely has a bargain vodka, rum, tequila, and so on that
you can use in the well. And as always with well liquor, choose one brand in
each category, but keep two bottles of it handy behind the bar.

Many histories for “86”
Speculation abounds about the origin of the term
86, meaning either to run out of something or to
cut off someone who’s had too much to drink.
One story comes from the legendary Delmonico’s
in New York. The story says the restaurant used
to sell out of menu item 86 often, thus a tradition
may have been born. Others contend 86 is a ref-
erence to article 86 of the New York state liquor
code, which defines when a patron should be
refused service or “86’d.” Yet another explana-
tion is from Chumley’s at 86 Bedford St. in New
York City during the days of Prohibition. When the
cops were going to raid the bar, the bartender
yelled “86!” and everyone would run out the
Bedford Street door because the cops usually
would come in the side door. And finally: The
term is just a variation of the slang term deep six.

Beer
Beer was among the first beverages served in pubs around the world, and 
it’s sure to be the last. After you’ve chosen the beer for your menu (check 
out Chapters 9 and 12 for help), you have to know how much to stock so 
you don’t run out! Table 8-3 is a list of what you need (and how much).

Chapter 8: Setting Up Your Bar’s Inventory

You may have noticed that kegs aren’t mentioned in this list. There’s a good
reason for this. While kegs do contain beer, they’re a different animal. You need
to have one keg connected to each of your taps (preferably with a correspond-
ing tap hand that makes it easy to see what you’re pouring), plus at least one
backup keg for each kind of beer you sell. Notice we did not say for each tap.
(You may be pouring Miller Lite, for example, at three different taps, two inside
and one outside, during the warm months. You may not necessarily need to
keep three backup kegs if you don’t use beer at all those stations quickly.)
You’ll have to judge how quickly you go through kegs in a week. Most places
order beer once or twice a week because they just don’t have the space to
store more than that.
Wine
To help choose wines for your bar, please see Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition,
by Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley), and talk to your local reps.
There are just too many to suggest specific brands and vintages.
We recommend offering no more than two of each variety (red, white, blush,
and sparkling wine). A local wine is always a good choice. Everyone has a
favorite, but you’re running a bar, not a French restaurant. Keep the selection
small (because you have to store it all) and at a medium price. I did know of a
bar that had a special: a bottle of Dom Pérignon and a bologna sandwich for
$125. It was the talk of the area. Good word-of-mouth advertising!
Keep a case of each wine you serve on hand. And keep it at the right tempera-
ture. White wine should be cold, very cold. Red wine should be kept around
70 degrees Fahrenheit. You don’t need to refrigerate it, but don’t store it near
the oven.
Mixers and soft drinks
The most efficient way to store most mixers on your premises is with a bag-in-
the-box (BIB) soda system. Soda water is mixed with concentrated syrup on
demand through a fountain system of some sort, most often a soda gun in
bars. Fruit juice is also used in many cocktails. Please see Chapter 12 for a 
list of the typical mixers you should stock.
Talk to your local food supplier for help getting a system. They may install
the system for free if you agree to buy all your syrup from the company, with
a guaranteed minimum per month.
Keep one backup of each syrup box on hand for easy restocking. If you have
several fountains or guns, you may need a couple of extra boxes of your most
used items, typically cola, diet cola, and lemon-lime soda. Until you get a feel
for how much you go through, consider doubling up on these must-have items.
138
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Also, don’t forget the cocktail mixes currently available on the market.
Cocktail mixes are the premixed bottles of stuff you add to liquor to give it 
its identity. They’re essential for many common cocktails, including Piña
Coladas, margaritas (many different flavors), and Bloody Marys. Popular
mixes include
 Daily’s Fruit Mixers (www.dailysfruitmixers.com)
 Holland House
 Mr. & Mrs. T’s
 Tree Ripe
 Major Peters (www.majorpeters.com)
Sometimes these products are sold by food vendors, rather than liquor 
vendors. Check with your reps to see who carries what in your area.
While you don’t need a full case, you should keep a bottle or two around 
of Rose’s lime juice (it’s a sweetened lime juice-ish thing) and pomegranate
juice. Pomegranate juice is really hot at the moment. If you really want to 
be ahead of the curve, throw in some Açaí juice for good measure. It’s the 
up-and-coming juice with 30 to 40 times the antioxidants of pomegranate
juice. Healthy cocktails — who knew?
Frozen-drink machines make complete frozen cocktails, and many companies
will offer you a great beverage program. (We recommend Island Oasis. You
can check out the company’s products at www.islandoasis.com.)
Water
Bottled water is popular even in bars. It comes in two very broad categories,
sparkling (with bubbles) or still (without bubbles). We recommend you
choose one of each type. Talk to your sales rep to get the information on
where the water comes from, how it’s filtered, what minerals are in it or are
removed from it, and on and on, assuming you’re interested in that. It’s good
to know, in case someone asks you. People like to know the ins and outs of
your business.
A few common brands of still water are Fiji, Poland Spring, Dasani, and
Ozarka. Popular sparkling choices are Perrier, Saratoga Springs, and San
Pellegrino. Keep six bottles of the two brands you choose behind the bar, and
a case of each in the cooler.
139
Chapter 8: Setting Up Your Bar’s Inventory

Stocking your basic food items
Most liquor will last and last (if you keep it at the right temperature, of
course), so when you’re getting started, you may have more inventory 
than you’d like. Ultimately, you sell it, but you tie up your cash in inventory.
However, food is a different story. Food is perishable. You buy too much, 
and it ends up in the trash. You don’t want to throw your money away, so 
buy fresh items judiciously.
Here are a few general tips for stocking food items in your bar:
 Most produce spoils in two to three days, so buy only what you can use
during that time. Strawberries, bananas, and pears are prime culprits.
 Produce stays fresher longer if you don’t wash it or cut it until you need it.
 Uncut citrus and apples last longer, up to a couple of weeks, if refriger-
ated properly.
 After produce is cut, use it quickly. Cut bananas, apples, and pears as you
need them. Use citrus within 11⁄2 days. Use strawberries the same day.
 Overstocking encourages waste. Stock only what you need.
 For food items, fresh is better. If you can get daily deliveries, do it.
Ultimately, the amount and type of food you need to stock depends largely 
on your bar’s menu (see Chapter 9). For now, though, just make sure to plan
ahead with regard to how much and what type of food you need to store, 
and check out Chapter 14 for tips on using your fresh and staple inventory 
to your advantage.
Garnishes
Ultimately, your business levels dictate your garnish levels. Because many 
of these items are perishable, you walk the fine line of making sure you have
enough, but not so much that it goes to waste. It’s truly a trial-and-error situa-
tion. The number of garnishes you have at the ready totally depends on how
many customers you have, what they are drinking, and how you garnish the
beverages. And your garnish level depends on how labor intensive the gar-
nish is. You may choose to dedicate more caddy space to hand-stuffed olives
(which take your bartender some time to make) than to, say, maraschino
cherries (which generally come right out of a jar).
But we don’t want to totally leave you hanging, so Table 8-4 gives you some
help in getting started with figuring out how much you need. And Chapter 12
can help you decide what garnishes to choose for your drinks.
140
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Notice we give you two different par levels, one for weeknights and one for
weekend nights. (For more information on par levels, or how much of an item
you should have on hand at the beginning of a shift, take a look at Chapter 14.)
We’re assuming that Friday and Saturday are busy nights for your bar; if that’s
not the case, adjust accordingly. Many bars create par sheets for each and
every shift.

 Angostura bitters
 Worcestershire sauce
 Hot sauce
 Superfine sugar
 Salt and pepper
Always have at least a case of each of these in backup, especially the hot
sauce; you’ll also use this on the tables.

In most cases, you’ll buy your cleaning supplies from a company that 
specializes in commercial cleaning supplies, like Ecolab (www.ecolab.com).
It provides a full range of products (such as floor degreasers, sanitizers, and
drain cleaners) that work better on the tough dirt, grease, and grime that
bars create.

Planning and Creating Your Menus
In This Chapter
 Deciding what food to serve
 Creating your drink menu
 Pricing your menu
 Putting it all on paper
 Figuring out when to make changes
A
bar is a wonderful gathering place. A place to get away from the world,
relax, hang out with friends, or just watch other people. In most cases,
people come to your bar to eat and drink, in no particular order. So you, as the
owner, need to create menus to give your patrons listings of the drinks and
food items you serve. Your menus show the world your take on food and bev-
erages. Every bar has a martini, but not every bar has your martini. This is
truly your chance to let the world see your passion for the bar business. What
you choose to highlight on your menus, prepare behind your bar and in your
kitchen, and present to your customers is truly the soul of your business.
In this chapter, we give you tips for creating your food and drink menus. We
explain what your patrons want and expect from your bar and help you figure
out what to charge for it.
Planning Your Food Menu 101
Simplicity is essential when developing a food menu for your bar. Ninety-nine
times out of 100, your patrons aren’t coming to you for the latest in avant-
garde gastronomy. Instead, they want easy-to-understand, familiar items they
can snack on while they’re enjoying the beverages you’re pouring.
Yours is a bar, not a restaurant. Your menu should reflect that difference.

Figuring out what kind of food to serve
You can take any of these menu ideas and match it with your bar to create
synergy. (See Chapter 4 if you need help deciding the type of bar to run.) For
example, if your bar specializes in tequila, you can choose a menu category
listed in this section and serve foods that enhance your theme. You can stick
to appetizers that have a Mexican flavor, you can create a tapas menu that
complements your drink menu, or you can offer a full-blown food menu that
matches your bar’s feel. How you pair your bar and food choices is entirely
up to you (and your guests, of course; if they don’t buy, you can’t sell).
The descriptions in this section aren’t hard and fast. They’re intended just to
help you think about your own menu in an organized way.
Appetizing appetizer  
An appetizer is a dish that’s served before the main meal in a restaurant. In
bars, sometimes the appetizer menu is the only menu. The owner chooses
not to offer full-blown meals to patrons, instead giving them a choice of sev-
eral appetizers to snack on.
Common bar appetizers include these tasty options:
 Deep-fried jalapeño peppers stuffed with cream cheese
 Beer-battered onion rings with a special sauce
 Nachos slathered in cheese, refried beans, beef or chicken, black olives,
tomatoes, and anything else that seems tempting to you
 Chips and salsa
 Fried vegetables, like mushrooms, zucchini, or even dill pickles (one of
Heather’s personal favorites)
 Buffalo wings
 Fried mozzarella sticks
Are you sensing a theme here?
Appealing pub grub
Pub grub is the affectionate term for typical bar food, such as wings, onion
rings, cheese sticks, burgers, and so on. All things deep-fried (or high in satu-
rated fat) usually fall into the pub grub category. If you’re interested in serv-
ing food, this is usually a good place to start. People expect bars to offer this
kind of cuisine.
144
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Pub grub menus can include these filling foods designed to please your
patrons’ palates:
 Hamburgers: You can create dozens of variations on the basic burger:
the bacon cheeseburger, blue-cheese burger, mushroom-and-Swiss
burger.
 Sandwiches: Popular ones include the Reuben, grilled cheese, grilled
chicken, and so on.
 Chili: Hearty soups and stews are game-day favorites with bar-goers.
 French fries: Some barkeepers include onion rings and hand-cut chips
on their menu.
 Fried chicken fingers: You can list these as an appetizer, entree, or both.
 Regional specialties: Every area of the country has a food that’s unique
to that region, and bars are a common place to find them. For example,
in Indiana most bars that serve pub grub serve a fried pork tenderloin
sandwich. Many places in the southern U.S. include a po’ boy sandwich
(fried seafood served on a submarine roll).
 Pizza: This dish — deep, pan, or thin — is always a popular item and
can make a great profit. Consider including a small, individual pizza on
your menu.
Because people expect bars to have pub grub, giving them something more
or something different could be your draw and help you define what you
want your bar to be. Giving them something to crave and come back for again
and again can make you a success.
Happy-hour fare
Some bars choose to only serve food during happy hour, a period of time
designed to draw a crowd with special pricing and promotions. Sometimes
the food is the happy-hour draw, for instance. Maybe you set up a free buffet
from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday but keep drinks at their regular
price. Or maybe you sell two drinks for the price of one (assuming that’s legal
in your state), and charge $3 per person for the buffet.
If you’re considering hosting a buffet in your bar, consider these logistics
when selecting your food items:
 Ease of preparation: Choose food that you and your staff can prepare
quickly and easily because you’ll likely be restocking often. Most happy-
hour buffets are made up of appetizer options, simply for ease of eating
(the customer can take as much or as little as she wants).
 Hold times: Choose food that can sit for a little while (like 20 minutes)
and still taste good.
145
Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

 Safe containers for service: You need the appropriate serving contain-
ers (like chafing dishes or ice baths) to keep food out of the danger zone
(between 40 degrees and 140 degrees F). Otherwise, food-borne bacteria
can grow and make your customers sick. Take a look at Chapter 17 for
more help on keeping your customers safe.
Alternatively, you can create special happy-hour pricing (like 2-for-1 deals or
$2 off entrees) for items already on your menu. For more tips on special pro-
motions take a look at Chapter 16.
Tantalizing tapas
Tapas are snacks or small plates in the Spanish tradition. Patrons can order
several tapas to create their own meal or share them with friends. Often pro-
vided free in Spain with the purchase of alcoholic beverages, these small
plates make an appearance in many bars in this country. You can provide
very simple tapas, like a few olives, complimentary to guests, and make more
elaborate offerings, though still small in quantity, available for purchase.
Here are a few examples of tapas Heather recently sampled in bars across the
country:
 Fried new potatoes with chile pasilla aioli
 Ceviche (assorted seafood in a spicy lime vinaigrette)
 Cajun shrimp sautéed in a spicy cream sauce
 Marinated fresh anchovy fillets
 Manchego cheese croquettes
 Plato de fiambres (plate of cured meats)
 Pincho de pollo y chorizo (skewered chicken and chorizo sausage)
 Pimientos fritos (fried green peppers and coarse salt)
Although the original tradition of tapas is Spanish, many bar owners are experi-
menting with Mediterranean dishes, Greek cuisine (called meze), Asian flavors,
and anything else that strikes their fancy. You can call anything tapas — just
think small but shareable quantities.
Tapas food tends to be a bit fancier than your average bar fare, so make sure
you have ample kitchen space and culinary experience if you want to under-
take this ambitious endeavor.
146
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Full-blown menus
Many “bar and grills” or “grill and taverns” or “grill and bars” have larger
menus these days. Owners may start with a pub grub menu (see the section
earlier in this chapter for details) but expand their offerings further to
include items such as salads, entrees (such as ribs, steaks, and pasta),
desserts, and even kids’ menus.
Here are some familiar examples of bars with full-blown menus.
 Bennigan’s Grill & Tavern: www.bennigans.com
 Fox and the Hound Pub & Grille: www.tentcorp.com
 Fado Irish Pub: www.fadoirishpub.com
 Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar: www.buffalowildwings.com
Take a look at these Web sites to get a feel for the breadth and depth of their
menu offerings.
These places calls themselves bars (or pubs, taverns, and so on), but they
really operate more like restaurants. If you’re interested in running a bar with
a full menu, take a look at Running a Restaurant For Dummies by Michael
Garvey and Heather and Andrew Dismore (Wiley) for help with managing
your food inventory, details on setting up a full-service kitchen, and other
topics that are tailored to the restaurant industry.
Just because a bar has a complete food menu doesn’t mean it’s a family
place. Check your local legislation for laws pertaining to allowing children in
your establishment.
Considering what hours to serve food
If you decide to offer more than an appetizer menu, consider opening for
lunch and dinner. You can continue to get income during hours that the “bar
business” is not hopping.
If you serve food, you probably want to limit the hours you serve food, say
from 4 to 11 p.m., for example. Your bar can stay open later to satisfy drink-
ing patrons, but you can close the kitchen when customers are less likely to
order food. You maximize your labor dollars (which increase with the
number of hourly kitchen employees on the clock) during the times you’re
taking in more revenue from food.
147
Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

Determining the size of your menu
As we note in the Introduction to this book, we assume that if you’re reading
this book, you’re running a bar or tavern that may or may not serve food. We
aren’t expecting that your establishment is a restaurant with a bar. Having
said that, we recommend that you keep your menu fairly small, with 10–12
items at the maximum.
Take a look at Table 9-1 for our recommendations for how to break down
your menu.

Analyzing your kitchen space
Most bars have scaled-down kitchens compared to restaurants, so definitely
take into account the size of your kitchen before you finalize your menu. If
you plan on serving full meals, you need a larger kitchen than if you are
simply serving (mostly) fried appetizers. With full meals, you may need an
area to put together salads and bread, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and
of course, equipment to cook and refrigerate many different ingredients. If
you’re, instead, serving eight different fried appetizers you need a few fryers,
a prep table, and a cooler, for example. With a smaller menu, you need less
variety in equipment and preparation space.
Here’s a list of the most common stations, or areas where food is prepared,
you’ll find in a bar kitchen:
 Fryer: The fryer is probably the most common and most frequently used
station in the bar kitchen. Things like, er, fries are made here. You can
use this station to prepare jalapeño poppers, onion rings, egg rolls,
cheese sticks, breaded calamari, and chicken tenders.
148
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Many fried menu items come to you frozen from your suppliers. If you
have space, place a small reach-in freezer near the fryer to keep those
items handy and close.
 Grill: You can choose a flattop grill (similar to a huge griddle) or a grated
grill (a bigger version of the tool in your backyard), depending on what
you want to cook. A grated grill is essential for making those pretty little
checkerboard grill marks on chicken, steaks, and burgers. A flattop grill
is great for things like grilled cheese sandwiches or grilled peppers and
onions. If you have the space, choose both kinds; you’ll have much more
flexibility with your menu items.
 Oven: Depending on your menu, you may not need this particular sta-
tion. An oven is great if you’re making pizza, roasting meats, or baking
lasagna.
You may see many different kinds of ovens at your equipment supplier’s
showroom. Make sure you discuss your specific needs with your sales-
person before he or she sells or leases you more oven than you can use.
And don’t forget to take a peek at Chapter 7 to get tips for choosing your
appliances.
 Sauté: This station consists of a multiburner range, shelving to hold
tools and supplies (such as sauté pans, tongs, and plates), and possibly
a small cooler (a small refrigerator in kitchen lingo) to hold ingredients.
Anything that’s cooked in a pan to order (like pasta or a sautéed shrimp
appetizer) is made at the sauté station.
In a bar, you may not have an actual sauté station, but more than likely,
you need a range with about six burners and someone who knows how
to use it.
 Pantry: The term pantry may be too elevated for a bar kitchen, but basi-
cally, the pantry is the area of the kitchen where cold menu items are
assembled. If you serve salads, ceviche, or cold sandwiches, your
kitchen staff assembles them here. In your bar, this station may simply
be a small area with a bit of counter space and a cooler.
 Other stuff: You may also need a decent-size (5 x 3 feet) prep table and a
microwave. We wouldn’t call them stations, but they’re handy to have in
most bar kitchens.
Use your kitchen to help you determine your final menu. If you don’t have an
oven, for example, it will be tough to include pizzas on the menu. Without a
fryer, you can’t very well make French fries or homemade potato chips. Take a
look at Chapter 7 for information on getting the right equipment for your bar.

Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

Thinking about signature dishes
Many bars become known for a specialty. It may be a particular item high-
lighted on a particular day, like Friday Fish and Chips. Or it could be that you
have the best burgers on the block. Decide what you want your specialty to
be and make sure that you can make money on it and produce it quickly. This
section shows you how.
Insisting on high profit margins
One of the biggest mistakes people make when developing signature dishes is
choosing ones that are too expensive to make or too costly for very many
patrons to buy. So opt for signature dishes that are inexpensive to produce,
but still extremely tasty.
Take a look at the section “Pricing Your Menus Right,” later in this chapter,
for help on figuring out what to charge to make a profit.
Requiring easy preparation
If you create tasty, affordable dishes as signature items, your patrons will
order them in volume. Do yourself a favor and make them a breeze to pre-
pare. After you know how many items you sell on a given night, you’ll be
better able to handle the volume, but make it easy on yourself when you’re
first starting out.
Establishing good-quality recipes
Nothing is more frustrating to a patron than to order something in your bar,
like it a lot, order it the next time, and receive something different. When
patrons become regulars, they will notice variances in your food quality,
sometimes before you do. Whatever menu you decide on, make sure your
staff can execute it consistently every time a customer orders it.
Employees achieve consistently excellent products when they’re trained well.
Don’t skimp on training them how to execute your menu items your way.
Training manuals are excellent tools to give everyone the same message, and
they give them something to refer back to as questions arise. Take a look at
Chapter 10 for help on training your employees.
Consistency in food and drink is very important; it is a very big complaint in
the business. Customers come to your place for that item cooked that way.
Keep a good recipe file in the kitchen and bar. However, in the bar, you will
probably hear, “I like the way Ray makes my drinks,” which you can’t do
much about.
150
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Planning Your Drink Menu 101
Most bars are fully stocked bars, so patrons can order their favorite cock-
tails, such as a gin and tonic, Crown and Coke, or margarita. But many bar
owners create specialized drink menus to steer patrons toward unique bever-
ages and cocktails that customers can only get at their place. Spend some
time thinking about what kinds of drinks you want to be known for, and then
create a menu to match.
For details on the types of liquor, wine, and beer available to bar owners, take
a look at Chapter 8.
Selecting beers for your menu
Select three local brews, three national beers, three light beers, and three
imports. You can choose more or fewer, depending on the size of your place.
And of course, if your theme demands that you keep 80 beers on tap, you can
disregard our aforementioned advice.
Storing beer at the right temperature is an important factor in maintaining its
quality. Beer requires cold storage, so make sure that your walk-in cooler (a
refrigerated room with proper door seals and a thermostat to regulate the
temperature) is large enough to accommodate your inventory.
Creating a signature cocktail menu
When owners concoct signature cocktails for their bars, they often choose to
name one of them after the bar or the bar owner (Hymie Lipshitz Great
Oversized Martini). In some cases, your signature cocktails match your food
menu (like creating special margaritas to go with your happy-hour fajita bar).
Whatever you choose, make sure that your signature cocktails are special to
your place. You want to create a vibe that says, “You can only get this here.”
Martinis are easy to use as a signature cocktail because you can simply
change the garnish. You can use house-stuffed olives — filled with blue
cheese, anchovies, hot peppers, and other stuffings with a strong flavor — to
make a signature impact.
You’ll likely sell many signature drinks, so make sure you choose something
that’s fairly easy to make. Or you can make them up in batches ahead of time
for ease of service.
151
Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

Infusions are a great way to make something truly special to your bar. An infu-
sion is a vodka that’s been infused with fruits, herbs, candies, vegetables, and
the like for three to four days or more. By creating your own recipes for infu-
sions, you can create a one-of-a-kind cocktail.
Here are a few things to keep in mind when making your own infusions:
 Choose organic produce. Pesticides and vodka don’t mix.
 Clean all your ingredients before you place them in the vodka. Impurities
and dirt can ruin the infusion.
 Choose glass jars with tight-fitting lids to create your infusions. Talk to
your liquor purveyor to get free containers.
 Create and test the first batch of a new recipe in the back of the house
(not behind the bar) to make sure that your ingredients don’t turn the
vodka an unappetizing color. The last thing you want is an interesting
bottle filled with brown liquid in full view of your patrons.
 Create drinks using your infusions that appeal to your clientele.
Think about serving your specialty drinks in specialty glassware. Use a local
garnish, a special glass, a special size, or something else that distinguishes
them as your signature drinks.
Planning your wine list
Depending on your expertise, clientele, and food menu, you may have a fairly
small wine list. Most true bars offer two or three reds, two or three whites,
two champagnes, and a blush wine. Consider listing your selections on the
menu in flavor categories. For more details on how wines differ, take a look at
Chapter 8. And take a gander at Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed
McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley).
If you choose to run a wine bar, you will need many more wines than we’ve
recommended here, with extensive menu descriptions and a knowledgeable
staff.
Including nonalcoholic drinks
Don’t forget to include signature nonalcoholic drinks on your menu.
Designated drivers, expectant and nursing mothers, aspiring athletes, and
others enjoy bars without consuming alcohol. Don’t miss the chance to
dazzle them with something beyond a virgin strawberry daiquiri.
152
Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

If you’re not feeling too creative in the nonalcoholic department, consider
serving beverages made by companies such as SoBe, Snapple, or AriZona to
help you fill this niche.
Pricing Your Menus Right
The only way money comes into your bar is when patrons purchase your
menu items at the price you choose. (Money goes out of your bar in so, so
many ways, but that’s covered in Chapters 14 and 15.) So you must price
your menus correctly to cover your overhead expenses (including things like
rent, insurance, and salaries), your costs (like the ice, liquor, and garnish)
and incidentals like napkins, stir sticks, and tiny plastic garnish swords.
You can price your menu several different ways. But if you charge more than
people are willing to pay, you have a problem. And if your patrons will pay
more than you’re charging, you’re leaving money on the table, so to speak.
Using food cost to price your menu
Your food cost percentage (often shortened to simply food cost) is the cost of
all the ingredients used to make the dish divided by the menu price. This per-
centage is a guide to help you control your costs and assess your profitability.
Figuring out the cost of a dish
Here’s how you figure out how much a dish costs you to make it. We use
cheese fries as an example.
1. Figure the cost of the fries you use.
An 8-ounce portion of French fries costs about 30 cents.
2. Add the cost of the cheddar cheese you melt on top.
The cost of 3 ounces of cheddar cheese sauce is about 15 cents. So now
you’re up to 45 cents.
3. Add the cost of the side of ranch and the side of ketchup you serve
with the dish.
Assume you’re giving your patron 2 ounces of each, at around 7 cents
for ranch dressing and 2 cents for ketchup. You’re looking at about 54
cents in food cost so far.
153
Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

4. Add 5 to 10 percent for napkins, foil, plastic wrap, and any paper
goods associated with the item.
To simplify the math, we are going to add 5 cents here, not quite 10 per-
cent of our subtotal, to bring the total food cost for this item to 59 cents.
You also need to figure out the cost of your shortening (or oil), seasonings,
and other service items associated with the dish to get the most accurate
food costing.
If you serve any complimentary items, such as nuts or popcorn, to guests, make
sure you figure in a cost for those items when you’re pricing your menu items.
Pricing items based on food cost
Most bars run an overall food cost percentage in the mid-30s. So you should
price your food no less than three times as much as it costs you to make.
Here’s how you use food cost to set your menu prices:
1. Find the food cost of the item.
See the cheese fries example in the last section to figure this out. Our
portion costs us 59 cents.
2. Divide the cost by your food cost percentage goal.
If you want to run a 35 percent food cost, take the 59 cents the fries cost
you and divide it by 35 percent (.59 ÷ .35= $1.69).
3. Adjust the price to make sense when patrons read it on the menu.
Basically, $1.69 would be a strange price to see on a menu. Round it up
to the next 25-cent increment (like $1.75) or even up to the next dollar
amount ($2.00) or near-dollar amount ($1.99). Your goal is to help the
patron be able to add the prices in his head.
Table 9-2 shows you how you could price cheese fries at different food cost
percentages.

This formula is a guideline, not an absolute rule. If your market will bear
cheese fries priced at $3.95 or $4.95, charge it. Your food cost on these items
will be lower (meaning they will be highly profitable), which could allow you
to charge a lower percentage for more expensive products and still hit your
numbers. Take a look at Chapter 15 for more details on running your bar by
the numbers.
Pricing your drinks
Pricing is a nuance that comes with experience, which is very tough to
explain in a book. Pricing is determined by what you can get, reasonably,
from the customer, and by the area and the kind of bar your have. Of course,
you would like to deposit more money in the bank, but will Joe customer pay
you for it? Difficult question. From the beginning, you have to do comparison
shopping in your area and get your bar prices in the right groove, not too
high and not too low.
Raising prices is very difficult in bars. Raise the price 5 cents on a drink, and
you could have a customer mutiny on your hands.
The majority of your revenue (generally around 80 percent) in the bar busi-
ness comes from drink sales. Consequently, pricing them competitively and
profitably is necessary. You’ll have to do some math, but don’t be scared;
we’ll help you through it.
We can give you formulas and strategies for pricing your drinks, but ulti-
mately your customers have the final say in what you can charge, simply by
their buying decisions.
Your pour size, or how much liquor you include in each drink, is critical to fig-
uring out how much a drink costs you and consequently, how much you can
charge.
Most bars pour either 1 ounce or 11⁄2 ounces of alcohol in each drink. (If the
customer orders a double, you, um, double that amount of liquor in each
drink.) So from a liter bottle you get about 30 or 20 drinks, respectively. Take
a look at Table 9-3 for details on how much different pour sizes of differently
priced liquors cost you.

To complicate matters further (but actually make your life easier, trust us),
most bar owners create a tiered pricing structure for cocktails. They catego-
rize their liquors by price (and presumably by quality): well, call, premium,
and super-premium. Then they set their prices for each category (even if the
cost per bottle within the category varies a bit).
Table 9-4 describes the categories and gives you some examples of brands
that fall within each category.

We’d love to tell you exactly how to price each category of drinks. But given that
we have no idea about the prices in your neighborhood, not to mention the logis-
tical problems involved in printing them all in this less-than-400-page book, we
can tell you to do your research. Don’t feel greedy because remember, you have
to cover way more than just the cost of your liquor with your drink prices. You
have to cover ice, garnishes, glassware, rent, salaries — the list goes on and on.
If you stock high-end cordials, cognacs, and scotch, you can pay hundreds of
dollars for a single bottle. Set special prices for these special items.
Do not overprice your drinks, or you will have no business. Do not under-
price your drinks, or you will go out of business! Balance is the key here.
Check out your area for prices because in order to succeed, you must be
within the price range of your competitors. So do your homework.
Designing and Printing Your Menus
After you’ve decided what you actually want to sell to your patrons, you have
to decide how you want to let them know what you have to offer. Most bar
owners have a few different menu formats, so this section helps you figure
out what you want yours to look like.
For help in laying out your menu, take a look Advertising For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Gary Dahl (Wiley). Many of the techniques used to design ads are
also used to create menus. Plus, you can get some good ideas on how to
advertise your business.

Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

Experimenting with layout
As with choosing your menu items, simple is best when it comes to laying out
(designing what the physical menu is going to look like) the menu. Make it
easy for your customers to decide what they want to order by following these
basic guidelines:
 Choose formatting carefully. Use options like italics, bold, CAPITALIZA-
TION, and underlining sparingly and only for emphasis. Remember:
You’re creating a menu, not a ransom note.
 Separate your food menu from your drink menu. You can choose to
place one menu on each side of the same piece of paper so patrons can
just flip the sheet over. Or you can have a separate sheet for each menu.
 Group like items together. Place beers together, cordials together, mar-
tinis together, shooters together, and so on. This format makes it easy
for patrons to find what they’re thirsty for.
 Create clear headings that tell patrons what they can find in each sec-
tion. This also helps people find what they want. You can even use
descriptors as headings, rather than traditional beverage categories. For
example, instead of just “Draft Beer,” you can have subcategories that
describe the different styles of beer and their tastes. So if a patron’s in
the mood for something “crisp and light,” they can look for that descrip-
tion and select a beer to match.
Menu engineering basics
Menu engineering is the strategy of laying out your menu to encourage your
patrons to order the items you want them to buy, often the items with the
highest profit margins. Choose where you want to place the items on the
menu and what fonts, graphics, and formatting you want to use to highlight
various items.
The first place patrons look is the middle of the upper half of your menu.
Place your high-profit items here to increase your sales. Take a look at 
Figure 9-1 to see this spot. You can also use graphic icons to highlight signa-
ture dishes or other specialty items on your menu. And research shows that
in a long list of menu items, the first, second, and last items are typically the
most often chosen.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Writing the menu text
Writing menu text is similar to writing a commercial for your menu items.
Think about selling the cocktail to your patron. Tell them what’s in it (our
house-infused, lime-coconut vodka), how it’s prepared (shaken with crushed
ice and cream of coconut), what it tastes like (crisp and refreshing), and so
on. Consider telling them how they’ll feel when they’re drinking it (refreshed
after a hot day).
Descriptive text is always better than a boring listing of drinks. The menu
description is your chance to show patrons why your cocktails (and other
menu items) are special and something they can’t get just anywhere.
Placing your menus in the bar
If you want patrons to use your menu, you have to make them visible. Many
times patrons will order something they’re familiar with, without ever looking
at your drink menu. Make menus easy to access for all your patrons.
Specials boards
A specials board is a chalkboard, dry-erase board, or other placard that
allows you to quickly write down the, um, specials each day and display them
prominently for guests and staff members alike to view. You can post them by
the front door, over the bar, or on an easy-to-see wall.

Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

Table tents
A table tent is a small menu that stands alone on a table or at various points
along the bar, with a listing of menu items. Often, table tents promote spe-
cials or list your signature drinks. Unless you have a small menu (like just a
few appetizers), table tents are typically too small to list all your menu items.
You can choose table tents made out of card stock that lasts for a while, and
then toss them when they get soiled. Or you can buy table tent card holders
made of clear plastic. You can easily swap out the cards as you change spe-
cials or decide to promote something else. Take a look at Figure 9-2 for an
example of a table tent.
Don’t forget that your liquor distributors may be willing to give you table tent
holders adorned with their logos for free.
Make sure staff members wipe down table tent covers regularly (at least once
per day). These things can get grimy, and nothing is less appetizing than
thinking about ordering food, only to pick up a filthy menu.

Part II: Gearing Up to Open the Doors 

Drink menus
Many bars have menus that include all their spirits, wine, and beer offerings.
Make them available and accessible to all your patrons.
Food menus
Decide how visible you want your food menus. If you want to sell lots of food,
make sure you have the menus out where patrons can use them. Consider
including a food menu as one side of a table tent.
Making Changes to Your Menu
Every bar changes its menu at some point. So it’s not a questions of if you’ll
change your menu, but when you’ll change your menu.
Here are a few things to consider as you decide to change your menu:
 Give your opening menu a chance to work. Allow at least a month or
so to let your patrons try several things and find their favorites.
 Avoid a tiered menu pricing system (meaning all menu items in a cate-
gory, such as appetizers, are priced the same). If you vary your prices,
you can offer a wider range of items to satisfy a more-diverse clientele.
 Consider seasonal specialties. You may include chili on your fall and
winter menus but remove it during the spring and summer, for example.
Maybe a variety of mojitos dominate your menu in the summer, but
coffee drinks come into play in cold-weather months.
 Commemorate holidays. You can create a special margarita menu to
coincide with Cinco de Mayo. Or develop an all-Irish food menu to com-
memorate St. Patrick’s Day.
 Consider what other bars in your area are serving. Keep a constant
eye on your competition. You should know about their happy hours,
promotions, food menus, and anything else they are offering their (and
your!) patrons.
 Stay true to your goals and mission. Don’t veer from your vision of your
bar to simply follow the crowd, making your bar like every other bar in
town. If you believe in your concept and are running your business well,
you will be successful.
161
Chapter 9: Planning and Creating Your Menus

 Make changes sparingly. We recommend that you change your menu no
more than four times a year. That’s really the maximum. Most bars
change their menus twice a year at most.
 Run specials to try out potential new menu items. Talk to patrons who
order the specials to get their feedback. Consider sending out samples
to your regulars free of charge to let them try new drinks or dishes so
you can get their opinions.
Never change your entire menu all at once. Change can be very unsettling to
your patrons. They come to your place for a reason. They may not come back
if they can’t get their favorites.
Don’t forget that when you change your menu, you have to reprint the darn
thing. Save yourself some time and trouble by opting for plastic, leather, or
vinyl menu sleeves or holders. Then you can just swap out pages as you need
to, instead of reprinting the entire thing. Plus, menus in holders are much
easier to keep clean and reuse than the plain paper variety when the beer
foam flows!

that aspect in this part, too.

Your Employees
In This Chapter

 Hiring the right people for the job
 Training your new staff
 Terminating employees
B
ars tend to take on the personality of the people who work there. So 
you should make sure that the people you hire match the feel of your
bar. If you’re creating a fun, high-energy place to hang out, you have to have
fun, high-energy people working in it.
In this chapter, we cover different staff positions in the bar and give you 
tips on how to choose the best candidates to fill them. We explain how to
train your new staff members and keep them on your payroll for the long
term. And finally, we give you advice for how to end your relationship with
employees who aren’t working out.
Identifying the Players on Your Team
Most bar owners need several kinds of employees to staff their bars: 
bartenders, servers, and cooks. Bartenders make drinks. Servers serve
drinks. Cooks make the occasional pub grub order. We’ve expanded this 
team roster a bit in this section to include a few extra players, just in case
you need some additional help. Feel free to read the parts that apply to 
your bar and skip the rest.

Generally speaking you need one server for every four to five tables in your
bar. And you need two bartenders for every 15 stools. That way you have
plenty (but not too much) help to make drinks for servers and for patrons 
sitting at the bar. If you overstaff (or have too many staff members on duty),
no one makes money and good staff members will leave.
Front of the house: Bartenders, servers,
hostesses, and security staff
The front of the house in bar-speak is anywhere in your bar that a customer
may venture. It includes the bar, any dining areas, the stage, the restrooms,
and so on. Employees who work in the front of the house (often abbreviated
in written form FOH) represent you and your bar at all times, so they need a
few common characteristics.
FOH employees must be
 Polite: FOH employees should generally be “nice.” It seems like a 
no-brainer, but it’s important.
 Friendly: They should have a warm smile and be welcoming. They
should make people feel comfortable the minute they walk in the door.
 Well groomed: In general, employees should be clean, odor free, and not
scraggly. Set your grooming standards and make sure everyone adheres
to them. For more help, see the section “Creating standards and keeping
them up,” later in this chapter.
 Able to evoke the feeling of your bar: This characteristic is probably
the most subjective one. Consider, though, would you expect a yuppie
bartender at a biker bar, or vice versa? Would you expect an elegant
server at a poolside bar? Consider the feel of your bar as you’re hiring
your staff.
In the next sections we give you details on what to look for specifically when
hiring for certain positions in the FOH.
Bartenders
What would a bar be without someone to lovingly tend it? Bartenders make
or break bars, without question. Your bartenders are key employees. They
must be good with customers. They must project the right image for your
bar. And of course, they must be able to mix a good drink.
166
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Bartenders become friends, counselors, and godparents to their patrons.
They are the heart and soul of every bar. They can be gorgeous (as in the
movie Coyote Ugly), they can be entertaining (like in Cocktail), and they can
become like family (think Cheers). All the bartenders in these examples have
charisma and charm. They draw people to them, keep them at the bar, and,
more importantly, keep them coming back.
Here are a few things to look for when hiring your next bartender. A good 
bartender should be able to
 Socialize while working. The best bartenders are those who make it
look effortless. If an applicant can keep up a conversation with a cus-
tomer at the bar and make cocktails for the party of ten that just walked
in, hire him.
You don’t want bartenders socializing at the expense of working. Drinks
that are waiting to be made are drinks that are waiting to be drunk.
Customers can’t order another until they’re finished with the first (and
that’s the whole point, right?). So making drinks has to be the number-
one priority.
 Develop regular customers. Regular customers mean repeat business.
(“Norm!”) Repeat business means more money for you (unless of course
you let them run a tab that they don’t pay). Look for a bartender who
connects with people. She should be able to read people and hold down
conversations with anyone who may come into your place.
 Handle difficult situations. Unfortunately, when alcohol is involved, life
can get even more complicated than normal. Your bartender should know
when to refuse service to an intoxicated patron, anticipate service prob-
lems, and be willing to get help from other staff members appropriately.
 Make a good drink. Last but not least, your bartender should be
schooled in the art of mixology. He may not know every cocktail ever
mixed, but he should be able to make your signature drinks (or have a
quick aptitude for learning). Consider whether you want or need creativ-
ity in the drink-making department. Some bars benefit from having a cre-
ative bartender who whips up nightly specials, while others do better
with sticking to the basics.
If you run across a candidate who you think has the potential but not the
experience to run your bar, consider the person for a barback position. A bar-
back helps a bartender stock and restock the bar, empty the trash, and wash
glasses. He typically helps out with everything except making drinks during a
shift. This experience can help a new bartender get familiar with the pace of
your place before being thrown into the fire of running his own shift.
167
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

Servers
Sometimes called waiters or waitresses, servers take orders and serve drinks
and food to patrons. Servers need to have all the FOH characteristics listed
earlier in this section, and then some. They are responsible for selling your
products to your patrons. The revenue you bring in is a direct reflection of
how good they are at their job.
Check out this list of server-specific qualifications to look for when hiring:
 Aptitude for learning your products: A good server knows your liquors,
wines, and beers inside and out. If patrons ask her what’s on tap, she
should be able to tell them, instead of simply handing them a beer menu.
(Of course, if you have 50-plus beers on tap, a menu is quite helpful to
your patrons, but your servers should still be familiar with all of them.)
Knowing the products is the first step; recommending them appropri-
ately is something else. Quality recommendations come with experience
and education. Assume your patron is looking for a crisp, hoppy beer. If
the server recommends a stout, your patron probably isn’t going to
enjoy it and may not give you another chance to make him happy.
 Ability to develop regular customers: Many servers, like bartenders,
develop customers who come back to see them again and again
(whether they like it or not). Customers are drawn toward happy, posi-
tive people. Look for upbeat, friendly people to fill these positions.
 Organized and efficient: In a bar atmosphere, servers experience differ-
ent demands than they do in a restaurant. In a bar, a server may have
drinks for six separate tables on a single tray. In a bar, patrons move
around more than in a restaurant, so being able to keep track of who
ordered what and where they’ve moved to is a requirement. A good 
bar server remembers faces, orders, and who has paid for what.
Hosts, hostesses, and greeters
These employees greet your customers as they come in the door and show
them to their seats. You’re more likely to employ these particular people if
you run a tavern or bar and grill.
Helpful qualities in a greeter include:
 Friendly and approachable: If a person doesn’t smile easily and gen-
uinely, you probably don’t want her. A greeter may be the first and last
person your customers see in your establishment, so you want a greeter
who will give them a warm welcome and heartfelt so long.
168
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Effective at communicating: To keep a busy bar running smoothly, all
employees need to be able to work together to handle their areas. As the
first link in the chain, a greeter should communicate well with customers
and other employees. Greeters can inform guests about drink specials,
upcoming promotions (like a special live band), or discuss seating
options (like outdoor, at the bar, or pub tables). They can also help
servers by giving them seating updates on new guests in their sections.
 Excellent organization skills: Greeters often answer phones, take to-go
orders, coordinate seating with managers, and handle minor customer
concerns simultaneously. They must stay organized and composed
during the organized chaos.
Security staff
Club security or bouncers have long been hired for their larger-than-life size
and their physical intimidation factor. Owners hoped that by hiring huge
body builders, they would reduce the number of incidents because people
would be afraid to mess with them. That theory is changing somewhat as
more bars and clubs look for improved communication and problem-solving
skills in security personnel.
Security guards, first and foremost, control who gets into your bar. They
must be able to recognize and identify fake identification, keep underage
people from getting in, and screen incoming patrons for potential problems.
In a worst-case scenario, they help you handle any problems.
An effective bouncer can help you head off incidents before they become big
problems. A good security person has
 Effective communication skills: This idea may be new to some people
who have been in the bar business for a while, but the ability to talk to
customers, including those who are intoxicated or potentially violent, is
the best first step in avoiding a fight or other incident.
In a worst-case scenario, a guard who has effective communication skills
can help discuss the details of a bad situation with the authorities,
should the need arise. You need complete documentation of any inci-
dents, from calling a cab for a patron to breaking up a fight, so make
sure your guards can recall and accurately record the details. Take a
look at Chapter 3 for details on what your documentation should look
like to protect yourself.
 A quick wit: It may seem strange, but having a sense of humor can help
diffuse tense situations. Although you don’t want someone who is
extremely sarcastic and will alienate patrons or cause a situation to
escalate, someone with quick one-liners can often keep things on an
even keel. (“Yes, I know the owner too. In fact. he pays me to keep rela-
tives and friends out!”)
169
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

 The ability to make appropriate decisions: Throwing someone out of
the bar is not always the answer. A good security guard needs to have
other tools in his repertoire. Ask the potential guard about how he’s 
handled difficult situations in the past. How has he resolved them? Does
his solution match your philosophy? Also, ask him about a few scenarios
to see how he would react.
Here are a few scenarios you can use as examples to get started:
• A patron hands you a fake ID. What do you do?
• A couple is engaged in a heated argument in the bar. What do 
you do?
• A potential patron offers you money to get into the bar without
waiting in the long line. What’s your reaction?
• A patron may be using illegal drugs in your establishment. What 
do you do?
 Physical presence: Presence doesn’t mean the guard has to look like
they spend 15 hours a day lifting weights and taking steroids. But the
guard should have a cool confidence that tells people, “I am in charge.
Don’t mess with me because you won’t win.”
Don’t hire bullies or showoffs. Watch all new security staff members
closely for a week. Check them all out with the local and state police.
If you have complaints about them from customers, investigate the 
complaints immediately. If you have to replace them, replace them.
 A neat, clean appearance: A great security person will not have long
hair or lots of bling (flashy necklaces or jewelry). These items can be
used against a security person and a good one knows it.
Unless you have a security background, it’s very hard to train a security
person yourself. Retired police, fire, and security people are the best choice
to train others and keep on your payroll.
It’s your name, reputation, money, and liquor license on the line, so make
sure any guards or bouncers you hire properly represent you and consis-
tently act in your best interest.
Back of the house: Cooks and dishwashers
The back of the house (or BOH) describes any part of your bar where guests
can’t go. Typically, it refers to the kitchen and the office. Employees who
work in the BOH can be less friendly than your FOH (front of the house) 
staff, but they should still be focused on customer satisfaction.
170
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Most bars can do without a chef. If you feel like you need one, take a look at
Running a Restaurant For Dummies (Wiley) for details on hiring the right chef
for your business.
Cooks
In bars, the kind (and number of) cooks you need greatly depends on your
type of bar. (Take a look at Chapter 4 for help deciding what kind of bar you
want to run.) Assuming you have a standard pub grub menu, you’ll likely
need a couple of line cooks. Line cooks prepare food as guests order it. You
may also need a prep cook (a cook who comes in before busy shifts to chop
vegetables or make soups, for example). Your menu (see Chapter 9 for help
with this) and your type of bar will dictate how many cooks and which types
you need, but the requirements for hiring them are similar.
Here’s what to look for in a good bar cook:
 Punctuality: You need someone who will be there on time, every time.
 Willingness to learn: You need someone who is open to doing things the
way you want them done. Ideally, look for someone who eventually
wants to take on some responsibility for what goes on in the kitchen.
Ultimately, he may be able to order food supplies and write new menus.
 Previous experience: If you have a small kitchen, you have to have qual-
ified employees. You should hire cooks with experience, unless you’re
willing to spend a lot of time training them.
 Positive attitude: Cooks don’t have to be “people people,” but they 
have to be able to deal with the stress and chaos that goes with working
in a bar kitchen. They’ll need to be able to deal with misordered food,
quickly replace dropped and spilled items, and respond to a whole host
of other problems. Having a naturally positive attitude goes a long way
in this business.
Dishwashers
Despite the lack of glamour, dishwashers are essential if you serve any food
whatsoever. You need someone who can keep the dirty plates from stacking
up, the trashcans from overflowing, and the floors from becoming slippery.
When you’re looking for a dishwasher, pay attention to these characteristics:
 Good work history (if they have a work history): This position can be 
a great starting place for someone who wants to get into the bar or
restaurant business, so don’t discount someone because she doesn’t
have a lot of experience. But if she does have a work history, make 
sure it’s a positive one.
171
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

 Punctuality: Again, your dishwasher needs to be on time, every time.
 Necessary physical attributes: Dishwashing is a physically demanding
job. A person must be able to stand for long periods of time, lift heavy
loads, and carry stacks of dishes without dropping them.
Managers
Depending on the size of your restaurant, you may be the only manager, at
least for a while. But we recommend that you get at least one other person 
to help with these duties as soon as you possibly can, just so you can have
some semblance of a life. Managers supervise employees, ensure the bar is
running smoothly, and communicate with customers. They manage sched-
ules, inventory levels, purchasing practices, and sanitation policies. They are
essential to keep your business running well. If things are going right, the
owner’s doing his job; if things are going wrong the manager is to blame.
When you’re ready to take the plunge and hand over some of the control to
another manager, here’s what you should look for:
 Punctuality: Okay, this may seem totally obvious, but sometimes the 
bar business gets a little lax on this particular point. But remember, a
manager sets the expectation, and employees don’t deal effectively with
the “do as I say, not as I do” mentality.
 Integrity: You need someone you can trust to take care of your bar the
way you want it taken care of. You should be able to trust the person
with your money and your business while you’re away.
 Positive work history: Definitely check references and make sure
anyone on your management team has glowing reviews.
 Previous experience: Anyone in management should have extensive
experience in a bar, restaurant, or hotel. Now, having said that, some
hospitality schools are cranking out qualified candidates who may not
have management experience but could be considered for management-
trainee positions.
Finding the Right Employees
Staffing your bar with quality people isn’t easy. In this business, you’re not
just competing for the public’s drinking dollar; you’re also competing for the
best staff. You have to sort through lots of candidates to find the ones who
best suit your business. In this section, we show you how to find, interview,
and choose the right employees for you.
172
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Sourcing potential employees
Never has the hospitality industry had so many ways to find employees at 
all different levels than it does now. Gone are the days of hanging a “Help
Wanted” sign in your window and waiting. You have Web sites, recruiters, and
organizations all dedicated to hiring and training hospitality workers. In this
section, we give you the inside scoop on finding the right candidates for your
bar today.
The newspaper
The newspaper is still a great way to get local applicants who want to work
today. You can advertise for any position in the newspaper, from dishwasher
to manager, and get a decent response. The day you place the ad, be ready
with a stack of applications because lots of restaurant and bar people are
constantly looking for greener grass at the bar around the corner. Even if you
don’t have tons of positions, you’re likely to get swamped with applicants
when you first open.
Feel free to hang on to applications and resumes for candidates who are quali-
fied for positions you don’t currently have open. There’s always a chance that
someone you hire may not work out, so it’s nice to have a backup plan. But,
remember, the would-be employee is looking for a job now and if they’re a
good candidate for you, they’re likely a good candidate for someone else too.
Don’t wait too long (more than 3–6 months) or so if you really want them.
The Internet
Consider placing an ad or searching for applicants through job placement
Web sites. Although these services are usually free to applicants, they’re not
free to employers. Don’t let that discourage you though. Good help is hard to
find, and you just may need to pay a little for it.
Here are a few of our favorites Web sites for finding qualified candidates:
 Hcareers, www.hcareers.com: As of this printing, this online database
has nearly 400,000 subscribers and charges a maximum of $375 for a
single, 45-day job posting. Rates are discounted for multiple postings
and resume searching.
 Hospitality Career Network, www.hospitalitycareernetwork.com:
The network currently boasts 58,000 active job seekers on its Web site
and charges $200 for a single job posting for 90 days.
 CareerBuilder, www.careerbuilder.com: Many local papers are
hooked into Careerbuilder.com, so if you place an ad in the paper, your
ad goes to this online site as well. The price for these ads varies based
on your location.
173
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

 Monster, www.monster.com: Possibly the best-known job hunting Web
site, Monster is a good choice for the hospitality industry, too. Many job
seekers are looking for a career and start in bars and restaurants until
they can find a “real job.” They end up bringing career drive to their
part-time job and staying because they truly love it. Monster is a good
way to reach people who may not realize the bar business could be just
what they’re looking for.
You can place ads and search for applicants through these Web sites. Separate
fees apply, of course, but it may be a good idea to actively search for candi-
dates who meet your requirements rather than wait for them to find you.
If you live in a larger metro area, take a look at the Web sites for your local TV
stations. Some allow you to place free job postings online. Also consider online
community bulletin boards, such as Craigslist at www.craigslist.org, if you
live in a city with listings. In some cities, you can post jobs for free!
Recruiters
Recruiters are a great way to find high-end hospitality talent. Recruiters,
sometimes known as headhunters, scour the country looking for applicants to
fill specialized positions. They often charge 10 to 25 percent of the candidate’s
starting salary in exchange for their services. If you’re looking to simply staff
standard positions in your bar, skip this method and choose another.
Bartending schools
Many wanna-be bartenders attend a school to learn the basics. Most pro-
grams consist of about 40 hours of classroom and bar experience. Students
are tested on cocktail recipes, opening and closing procedures, and other
must-have bar skills, and they usually complete any required alcohol safety
certifications during their class time.
Most bartending schools offer placement services for their students upon grad-
uation. Contact a school near you for details on its programs and fees, if any.
Here’s a list of nationwide bartending schools that may offer training to 
students in your area:
 ABC Bartending Schools: www.abcbartending.com
 Bartending College: www.bartendingcollege.com
 Professional Bartending Schools of America: www.pbsa.com
174
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Word of mouth
As with many other businesses, in the bar business, people network with
each other. Because bar and restaurant people work similar hours, they
socialize with each other. Ask other bartenders or waitstaff for their recom-
mendations for new staff members. If one of your best servers recommends
someone to you, you can expect that she knows the person is qualified.
Liquor-company representatives are very good sources of potential employ-
ees. They are in other bars and taverns all day and are more than willing to
help you. They are the best; they know which bartenders and servers are
leaving or unhappy with their current situation.
Interviewing candidates
After you have a good selection of applicants, decide on your system for
interviewing candidates. If you’re hiring several staff members at the same
time, like when you’re first opening a bar, you may conduct a first, brief inter-
view just to screen out who not to hire. Then, use the second round to get
down to more details about individual candidates.
The interviewing process generally goes like this:
1. An applicant comes in and fills out an application.
2. Assuming the applicant looks good on paper, you, as the manager, meet
with him and screen him, asking general questions about experience,
goals, and schedule availability.
3. If you think the person is a good fit for your place, you can ask some
more-specific questions during this interview or schedule another. For
great second-tier questions, check out “Selecting the best applicants for
your bar” later in this chapter.
If you have the time to spend with each candidate, you can have more-
extensive conversations, role-play if necessary, and consolidate steps 2 
and 3 into one interview.
Testing bartenders and servers 
before hiring them
Assuming you want experienced bartenders and servers, we strongly 
recommend that you give them a written test during the interview process.
Although testing is not a silver bullet to definitively choose the prime candi-
dates, it can weed out some posers. Take a look at Figure 10-1 and Figure 10-2

Selecting the best applicants for your bar
If candidates pass the screening interview and the written test, the next 
interview gets down to the nitty-gritty. During an interview, you obviously ask
prospective staff members questions about their experience and availability.
But also pay attention to their body language, communication style, and 
ability to carry on a conversation. You want employees in your bar to be
engaging, interesting, and comfortable speaking to people.
Here’s a list of detailed questions you can ask potential candidates to get that
next level of detail about them and how they might fit with your place:
 Name a difficult situation you’ve faced at work. How did you resolve it?
 How do you handle difficult customers?
 Why are you the right person for this job?
 What bars do you like to hang out at? How is this one the same 
or different?
Never, ever ask candidates about their religion, marital status, sexual orienta-
tion, age, gender, race, political affiliation, nationality, or whether they have
children. To do so invites a lawsuit. You can’t ask them about their disabilities,
but you can describe the physical requirements of the job and ask if they have
any concerns about their responsibilities. Check out the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission’s Web site at www.eeoc.gov for details about what
may constitute discrimination. Make sure that everyone who hires in your
organization is familiar with the EEOC requirements, too. You’re responsible
for their actions on your behalf.
Making the job offer
When you think you’ve found the right employees, extend them an offer.
Discuss their pay, regular schedule, a start date, and their training schedule
with them. Make sure they know what they need to wear when they come in
on their first day.
Pay is not typically negotiable for FOH staff members. Servers typically make
one-half of minimum wage plus tips. In most cases, servers make minimum
wage while they’re in training and take no tips. It gives them an incentive to
get up to speed quickly so they can run their own shifts. Bartenders make
minimum wage plus tips. You may negotiate different hourly rates for BOH
staff members, based on the experience level and requirements for your
kitchen, but a general range is minimum wage for dishwashers and $8–$10
per hour for cooks.
178
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

In most cases, restaurant employees start on the first Monday (assuming
you’re open then) after they’re hired. Start them out during your slowest
times to give them some time to get used to the pace of your business.
Must-have forms for hiring staff members
As soon as you hire your staff, give them a copy of your employee manual
with all of your policies and procedures (see the “Creating standards and
keeping them up” section). Have them sign a document confirming that they
received a copy and agree to follow the rules of your place. Have them com-
plete any other necessary paperwork before their first shift.
We recommend you keep these forms on hand for new employees.
 I-9: Also known as the Employment Eligibility Form, every employee
must complete the I-9 in order to work legally in this country. Employers
must keep these documents on file for three years after hiring or one
year after the end of employment. We think it’s a good idea to keep them
on file for every employee at all times, no matter how long they’ve been
employed by you.
 W-4: These forms tell the IRS how much tax to withhold from each 
paycheck. The fewer dependents that an employee claims, the greater
the amount of tax that comes out of her check.
 Attendance calendar: This form isn’t a government requirement, but 
it helps you have a place to quickly jot down sick days, vacation days,
days off, late arrivals, and early departures. If your computer system
synchs up with your time clock, you may be able to keep track of this
more easily on the computer.
 Emergency contact card: Also not a requirement but very handy in case
of, um, an emergency. You also get a backup number to track down an
AWOL employee.
Create a separate file for each employee. Keep copies of all these forms as
well as their employment application, résumé, notes from their mom, and 
any other documentation that may come up in the course of business.
Training New Employees
In the world of bars and restaurants, there are as many ways to do things as
there are owners and managers. Even when you hire experienced employees,
you need to train them to do things the way you want them done. Hiring
experienced employees generally cuts down on the time it takes them to
learn your specific systems though.
179
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

When you start training, assume your employees don’t know anything about
your business. Tell them exactly how you want them to do things.
We recommend you give new employees
 Written materials to read and refer back to
 Hands-on experience to practice and hone their skills
 A mentoring structure to have someone to go to with questions
Training is expensive but necessary. Do it right the first time and hopefully
you’ll keep your people around and not have to train another batch right away.
Creating standards and keeping them up
Written standards are the most foolproof way to maintain consistency. If
someone can look up your vacation policy and see it written in black and
white, you’re likely have fewer discussions about the rules and exceptions 
to them.
Using an employee manual
An employee manual describes your company’s rules and procedures for
every employee. This documentation is the same for all employees, whether
they work in the FOH or BOH (front or back of the house, respectively) and
are a supervisor or staff member. An employee manual is the best way to
communicate your expectations for behavior, dress, level of service, and
more to your newest employees. Make sure each new employee gets a copy
of the manual on Day 1. Have them sign a form agreeing that they received a
copy of the manual to review.
Standard items that make an appearance in many employee manuals include
 Welcome letter
 Mission statement
 Company history
 Orientation period
 Communication policies
 Performance and job standards
 Code of ethics
 Confidentiality policies
180
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Emergency procedures
 Drug and alcohol policies
 Antiharassment policies
 Customer-service program
 Problem-solving procedures
 Safety issues
 Training meetings
 Performance evaluations
 Performance rewards
 Food-safety procedures
 Other policies
The employee manual is your best tool to communicate all the rules to every
employee in a consistent way.
Training for job-specific functions
In addition to understanding how things work in your bar, your new employ-
ees need to know how to do their jobs in your bar. An operations manual helps
you train employees to perform specific duties for each position. Thoroughly
explain each position, including the duties, standards, and objectives. Tell
them what they’re here to do, how to do it, when to do it, your quality stan-
dards, and so on.
Be as detailed as possible when creating your operations manual. Employees
can refer to it during and after training for questions that come up.
Here are some examples of what you should include in your operations 
manuals for different positions:
 Bartenders: Bartenders need the details on your recipes for cocktails,
inventory procedures, opening and closing procedures, standards of 
service, cash-handling procedures, comp drink policies, responsible
alcohol-service guidelines, and anything else you need them to know.
 Servers: Detail for your servers information about the products you sell
(including all liquor, wine, beer, and spirits). Include copies of all food
and drink menus. Give them detailed opening and closing procedures.
 Kitchen staff: Unless you have a very large kitchen with many different
positions, you can probably have a single operations manual for your
kitchen. Include opening and closing procedures, details on using differ-
ent pieces of equipment, and food-safety information.
181
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

Providing on-the-job training
In the bar business, you can memorize all the drink recipes, practice carrying
trays, and pretend to be doing the job all you want. But until you actually do
it, you don’t really know how to do it. There’s just no substitute for doing the
job itself. So training staff members while they’re actually working is a fact of
life in the hospitality business.
Consider having new recruits shadow experienced employees for several
shifts until they get the hang of the inner workings of your place. In most
places, a new employee trails or shadows an experienced employee for a
week. By the last shift in the week, the experienced server is trailing the
newbie just to make sure they have the systems down before they’re running
their own section.
Developing a mentoring program
Many successful bar owners develop their staff by creating a hierarchy. 
For example, giving one bartender the title of “Head Bartender” and making
him the primary contact for new bar staff members helps you in several 
significant ways:
 It develops supervisory skills in your experienced bartender, possibly
preparing him to take on more responsibility as your business grows
and expands.
 It gives new staff members an immediate resource to get answers to
their questions.
 It keeps training consistent because all trainees are hearing the same
information the same way.
 It frees you up to handle the millions of other things that are constantly
going on in your bar.
You can develop trainers in every area of your bar, as you need them. Choose
people who handle the ebb and flow of business well, handle their own respon-
sibilities with ease, and are willing to help other people practice their skills.
Improving Employee Performance
A successful bar is staffed by happy, hardworking people. Keep them in the
know and constantly challenged to keep them satisfied. You can motivate
them by providing opportunities for improving their skills and rewarding
their performance.
182
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Growing employee skill sets
Your bar’s success depends on keeping staff members informed about your
business, products, changes, specials, and promotions. You can keep employ-
ees happy and satisfied with their job through ongoing opportunities to learn
more about their jobs, their co-workers’ jobs, and the industry.
Here are some simple ways to help your employees improve their skills and
knowledge:
 Hold regular staff meetings: Set aside time to communicate with your
staff regularly. Many restaurants use a daily premeal meeting to discuss
what’s going on that day. You can implement a similar schedule in your
bar. Discuss drink promotions, nightly entertainment, and any special
events (such as conventions, for example) going on in your area that
may affect business that day. Have monthly meetings to discuss more
global issues that affect your bar’s systems and processes, menu
changes, or staff changes.
 Encourage cross-training for other positions: The most valuable
employees are those who can do several different jobs. They can jump
in and help out when another employee doesn’t show up. They provide
scheduling flexibility for vacation time, limited schedules, and swing
shifts (that is, shifts that stretch beyond a single “normal” meal period
like 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., for example).
But more importantly, to the employee anyway, cross-training offers
additional opportunities for exposure to different parts of the business.
For example, servers often want to learn to be bartenders. It may take
them awhile to get up to the speed of the most experienced bartender
on your staff, but cross-training them can help them understand more
about mixing drinks, how spirits differ, and what flavors work together
(and what don’t), and open up new worlds to them.
One of the greatest benefits of cross-training employees is the empathy
that develops. If a server has an idea of what it’s like to be behind the
bar with servers impatiently demanding drinks, she’s less likely to be 
so demanding when she’s on the other side.
 Encourage continuing education: Unless you run some megabar corpo-
ration, you probably can’t offer full tuition reimbursement for a complete
four-year degree in bar management for every staff member. But you may
be able to help students and lifelong learners in other ways:
• Post information on your staff bulletin board about relevant 
seminars and classes. Look to your local community colleges 
for personal enrichment classes in bar-related topics, such as
“Wine tasting for beginners.”
• Schedule training for staff members with your liquor, wine, and
beer salespeople.
183
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

• Develop a library of professional resources that staff members can
check out. Include books on customer service, bar management,
and mixology, among others.
 Offer advancement opportunities: Give employees a goal to work toward
and they often will. Of course, you need more Indians than chiefs in any
organization, so you can’t promote them all, but if your employees see
that you reward hard work with increased responsibility, it gives them
incentive to keep reaching.
Motivating your staff
Motivating your staff is essential to keeping them. And ultimately, giving them
respect is the best way to motivate them. People who feel that they are heard
and appreciated are much more likely to stay in a position than those who
feel insignificant and disrespected.
Here are a few specific ideas for keeping your staff motivated:
 Encourage staff communication with you: Don’t just say you have an
open-door policy. Actually mean it. Be willing to listen to their concerns
and ideas.
 Offer constructive criticism in private: Almost all employees need 
to work on some aspect of their performance at some time or another.
Make sure your criticism is constructive and discreet. So instead of
saying, “Your drink service is way too slow,” privately give them tips 
on how to speed it up.
 Praise them often in public: Find something positive to say to every
employee publicly every shift. If you’re having a hard time finding some-
thing positive to say, then you likely need to do more training with them.
 Know your staff and their strengths and weaknesses: All staff members
are not gifted equally. Set them up to succeed by tailoring their responsi-
bilities to match their talents. Have new staff members fully develop
skills before throwing them into the mix on their own.
 Be friendly (not friends) with your staff: Know about their interests and
life outside work. If your bartender is a student, ask about his courses. If
your cook plays drums in a garage band, ask how rehearsal is going.
Balance your interest with their comfort level. If you’re too friendly, they
may be uncomfortable. And don’t get so involved with the drama that
you lose the supervisor-employee balance. Nothing good ever comes
from it.
184
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Encourage camaraderie among your staff: Make sure staff members are
respectful to each other. Encourage them to help (rather than alienate)
newcomers. If your core staff is a closed clique, you’ll have trouble keep-
ing your new hires. Everyone doesn’t have to be friends, but they must
be friendly and respectful during working hours.
 Don’t lose your cool: Easier said than done some days in this business.
When you see tables full of empty glassware, peanut shells littering the
floor, wrecked restrooms, and empty ice wells, you may want to scream.
Stress and tension are incredibly infectious. If you lose it, your staff will,
too. Keep your composure when handling the inevitable chaos, and
you’ll win the battle.
 Develop incentive programs: Bar and restaurant employees love swag
and perks. Coordinate contests with staff training events. Say you’ve just
done a training of top-shelf vodkas. Give a preferred parking space to the
employee who sells the most on Friday night. If you roll out a new appe-
tizer menu, give a gift certificate to the employee who sells the most in a
weekend. Reward kitchen staff members if they hit certain ticket times.
Hold a mixology contest and reward the winning bartender with an extra
day off.
Incentives don’t have to cost you a lot. They just need to be valuable to
the people receiving them.
When It Doesn’t Work Out: 
Dismissing Employees
Unfortunately, rules do get broken and consequences ensue, which may
include terminating an employee. For your own protection, include a clearly
worded policy in the employee manual on how you handle infractions, and
follow it to the letter.
Here’s the standard sequence of escalating action to follow when 
problems arise:
1. Issue a verbal warning: Make a note in the manager’s log and in the
employee’s file that you discussed the situation.
2. Issue a formal written warning: This warning typically describes the
behavior, includes a plan for resolving the situation, and details the next
steps if the behavior doesn’t cease (or improve) immediately. You should
have a conversation with the employee, and then have them read the
warning, agree to the terms, and sign it. Place the warning in their file.
185
Chapter 10: Hiring, Training, and Keeping Your Employees

3. Suspend the employee: A suspension may last from a single shift to a
week, typically. If you’re considering any additional time, you should
likely terminate the employee.
4. Terminate the employee: If the behavior continues beyond suspension,
fire the employee.
You have to decide (and write down for everyone to see) what types of
infractions warrant these discipline steps. I’ve worked in places where this
type of a policy is in effect for punctuality and at other places where it’s
reserved for only very serious breaks in the behavior code.
It may seem obvious, but we’re saying it anyway. Do not, we repeat, do not
discuss any disciplinary situations with nonmanagement staff ever. If you do,
you risk opening yourself up to a whole lotta drama (including potential law-
suits) if the employee catches wind of your indiscretion. What happens in the
office stays in the office!
Looking at causes for immediate termination
Some situations, especially those involving illegal activity and violence, are
causes for immediate termination. When the safety of your staff, patrons, and
property are involved, you can (and should) skip the multitiered discipline
policy described in the previous section and go straight to termination.
Here’s a short list of our recommendations for immediate dismissal:
 Violence toward you, a customer, or another staff member
 Theft
 Flagrant rudeness to a customer
 Drug or alcohol use at work
Considering the legal issues involved
Definitely talk with your attorney before you open your bar to review the
basics of employment law in your area. He can help you get the specifics on
the regulations related to “termination with cause” and “termination without
cause” to make sure you’re covering all your bases.
Your best defense is a good offense. Make sure you have clearly written 
policies that you (and any managers working for you) follow consistently.
Document all infractions, training, and disciplinary situations so you can
clearly show patterns and present evidence if the need arises.
186
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Changing staffing levels during 
a business slowdown
In some areas, particularly seasonal resort areas, staffing up (or hiring addi-
tional people for your busy season) is a given. If you run a bar at an East
Coast beach resort, you may hire extra staff between Memorial Day and
Labor Day, for example. If your bar is located at a ski resort, your staffing
levels may be higher between Halloween and April 1.
Communicate your temporary staffing schedules to staff members when you
hire them. Explain the nature of your seasonal business and let them know
how long they can expect to work for you. You can avoid the uncomfortable
conversation of “you’re a great worker, but we don’t need you anymore” by
being upfront from the beginning.

Rule #1: Practicing Good 
Customer Service
In This Chapter
 Understanding why service makes a difference
 Training your staff with an eye toward service
 Handling situations when things don’t go as planned
T
here’s a business adage floating around estimating that it costs you 
five times more to gain a new customer than to keep an existing one.
Although it’s a tough statistic to calculate in the bar business, it certainly
feels true. Ultimately, you want your customers to be regular customers. 
Not only that, you want them to bring their friends in and have them become
regulars, too.
In this chapter, we unlock the secrets of the elusive art of customer service.
We show you why it’s more important than ever, even though fewer places
practice it consistently. We give you help in forming your own customer ser-
vice plan from Day 1. And we help you resolve customer service problems
with style and grace.
Why Customer Service Is So Important
Customer service is the ability to satisfy your customers’ needs and wants. 
It isn’t just important, it’s everything! And great customer service is more
than just handing your patrons the drinks or food they order with a smile 
and a “thank you.” That’s the minimum. You have to exceed their expecta-
tions on a regular basis to keep them coming back for more.

With a little luck (and a lot of management), your bar will turn into a great
meeting place. People will come in to meet other people and share great food,
a great beer, outstanding cocktails, and good conversation. That’s what it’s all
about. You and your staff have to make this happen! After all, as the saying
goes, “If you aren’t taking care of your customers, your competition will.”
A big step toward good customer service is to create an atmosphere of 
excellence in everything you do. Use the best products. Keep your bar
exceedingly clean. Create and maintain standards for food presentation.
Require spotless uniforms, clean wait stations, and impeccable service. 
Don’t accept anything less. Check out Chapter 10 for more information 
on setting standards for your bar.
Making people feel important
Every time a customer walks into your bar, he or she should feel welcomed
and wanted. No one should ever feel like you (or any staff members) are
doing them a favor by letting them sit at your bar. It should definitely be 
the other way around.
“Hello” and a smile are the best business card you have. Greeting people by
their first or last name makes everyone feel like they belong; it gives them a
sense of “This is my place.”
Here are a few things you can do to help make customers feel important:
 Listen to your customers. They want to tell you something because they
want you to succeed. Listen and say thank you.
 Do not start rumors or be a part of a rumor. If you don’t have anything
nice to say about someone or something, say nothing.
 Be prepared to settle arguments. Always keep a sports almanac, a copy
of Guinness World Records, or your computer on Google to check facts.
Don’t take sides. Just fix arguments. If you take sides, you’re sure to
make two enemies.
 Be hospitable. Get regular customers to schedule group luncheons at
your place. Try to get their softball team, the local Rotary, Kiwanis, or
any service group to have their luncheon meetings at your place. It
makes the regular feel special to say, “Come to my bar.”
Building customer loyalty
Building customer loyalty means creating regular customers, making people feel
like your bar is their bar. Feeling welcomed and appreciated is the key to creat-
ing this experience. Everyone who works for you can add to this experience by
190
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

remembering past orders and experience, calling guests by name, or in a gen-
uine and sincere way, telling them they’re glad they stopped in.
One of Heather’s friends has a philosophy specifically against using drink
specials to build relationships and loyalty with his clientele. He charges 
regular price for drinks, but then selects people each night to buy drinks for.
He walks around talking to people, making sure they’re having a great time.
Then he offers “the prettiest table he’s seen” a round of drinks and thanks
them for coming in. (Yes, he is an outrageous flirt, but his customers love
him.) Incidentally, he doesn’t just buy drinks for women. He buys them for
couples, men, and anyone else he’d like to see come back to his place. He
says he goes for an intimate experience “that appears to be from the heart.”
After he gives them that, he claims, “they’re mine forever.”
It’s more special to a patron to buy them a drink personally than to offer $1
off longnecks to everyone who walks in the door. Your customer feels like
“Wow, they actually care that I’m here, not just that someone is sitting in this
bar stool.” Personal attention builds customer loyalty.

All I really need to know I learned bartending
About ten years ago, I had a cover on BAR-
TENDER magazine. Now you can use it as a
customer service plan. This is for you: Make a
copy and hang it up for your employees to see.
Please don’t forget to give me credit. Thanks.
Ray Foley
Everything I really need to know about how to
exist in this world, personal or business, I learned
bartending. This knowledge was shared with me
by owners, managers, salesmen, waitresses,
waiters, bartenders, and customers. Most of
these teachers were successful in life’s every-
day challenges. These tips you cannot spend;
they are the tips you keep for life:
 Give everyone a fair shot.
 If you haven’t anything nice to say, don’t say it.
 Use the best premium products and you’ll
be the best.
 Serve.
 Be the solution to the problem, not part of
the problem.
 Don’t drink and drive; don’t let others.
 Respect salesmen; you’re one.
 Don’t take sides. You’ll make two enemies.
 Be neat.
 Wear a clean shirt every day.
 Don’t cheat or steal.
 Smile!
 Keep your hands and fingernails clean.
 Use Mr., Sir, or Ms., when talking to strangers.
 Don’t be a part of a rumor.
 Keep your space clean.
 Don’t waste.
 Be on time.
 Help others when they’re busy.
 Don’t use the easy way. Use the right way.
 Don’t give up. Follow your dream.

Here are a few other ideas for creating customer loyalty:
 Move beyond patron-owner mode, into friend mode. Get to know your
customers’ families and what’s going on in their lives.
 Know their business. (Not their personal business, mind you, but their
actual profession.) Be ready and able to discuss something you saw on
the news that made you think of them.
 Buy small, but thoughtful, presents for special occasions, like the birth
of a baby, wedding, or anniversary.
 Ask about their vacation or business trip.
 Know who their significant other is so you can ask about them. Be 
careful though, as not everyone is in a monogamous relationship. 
You don’t want to be in the middle of relationship discord.
Heather walked into one of her favorite places recently with a friend. 
Her favorite bar owner greeted her warmly, as always, and then became
uncomfortable when he saw her guest (a man he knew was not her hus-
band). She introduced her friend and mentioned that her husband and
her guest’s wife would be joining them shortly. The bar owner immedi-
ately relaxed and stopped eyeing the new patron suspiciously.
 Special order a product for them. Maybe you’ve had a discussion with
two of your regulars about their recent trip to Italy. They absolutely fell
in love with limoncello (lee-MON-chel-o), a thick lemon liqueur served
well chilled in a cordial glass. Special order a bottle for the next time the
patrons come in and share a glass with them.
 During Friday happy hour, tell your regulars that the first cocktail is on
the house.
 Have special glasses or mugs for your most loyal patrons with their
names on them.
 Put your regulars’ names on the bar stools or at the bar rail where they
normally sit.
 Name a cocktail after them: Mike’s Martini.
Of course, you can’t do all of this for everyone, every day. Start small, and
then build into long-lasting relationships. Take a look at Chapter 16 for more
information on building a permanent clientele.
You’re only as good as the customers who come to your place. Customers are
first and foremost. Do something nice and they will tell 10 people; do some-
thing wrong and they will tell 100. There is no substitute for good service!
192
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Training Your Team in the 
Art of Customer Service
Customer service must be something you live, not just something you say. It
absolutely starts from the top down. Your employees take their cues for how
to treat your customers from you. If they see you practicing good customer
service, they’ll follow suit. And you can help your employees practice good
customer service in other ways, which we explore in this section.
Hiring people with a service mind-set
Some people enjoy making other people happy and making someone’s experi-
ence a great one by making their day. Others sincerely care about making
sure people enjoy themselves and go out of their way to ensure that every
patron they take care of has a wonderful time. They may not be super-bubbly
or have the ability to talk to anyone about anything, but their desire to make
sure your guests are happy is their number-one priority. These, of course, are
the types of people you want working for you, to ensure that your bar is pro-
viding the best customer service possible.
Here are a few things to look for to get service-oriented employees:
 A smile: This smile should be what your patrons see the entire time
they’re in your bar.
 Sales experience: Often people who are in sales in other industries can
be fantastic bar employees. They bring their experience helping people
buy products in a retail store, for example, and use those skills in your
bar. Different product, same basic idea.
 A problem solver: Problems arise because things don’t go as planned.
(Really, who plans for problems?) Hiring employees who can think on
their feet and come up with solutions that work for you and the cus-
tomer is a terrific bonus to your bar.
 Organization: An employee’s ability to stay organized during the chaos
that is a day in the life of a bar is essential to heading off problems
before they happen.
 Empathy: A service-oriented employee sees the world from the customer’s
point of view. Taking the time to look at a burger and say, “Would I want to
eat this?” can stop a less-than-perfect plate from leaving the kitchen.

Chapter 11: Rule #1: Practicing Good Customer Service

Empowering your staff 
to make things right
Your bartenders and servers will be the first people to hear about something
that’s wrong in your bar, so you need to give them some authority to make
things right. Of course, you don’t want every complaint to end up in free
drinks for a party of four every night. But the easier you make it for a server
or bartender to make sure your patron’s experience is terrific, the chances
are higher that their service will pay off for you in the long run.
You have to balance how much authority you want employees to have, of
course, but here are a few ideas to help you establish your policy:
 A server or bartender should be able to immediately get a replacement
drink or food item if it doesn’t meet a patron’s standard. The longer a
patron waits, the more difficult the situation becomes.
 Consider giving staff members a certain number of drinks they can give
away at their discretion each night.
 Service means service. Your employees need to understand that they
will have to make decisions on the spot; they cannot call the manager
every time there is a problem. When employees must replace a cocktail
or a meal item, tell them to write down what they replaced and an 
explanation. Then you can solve that problem after the customer leaves.
Don’t get into an argument with the customer. The customer is always
right. Remember, though, that some problems should only be handled
by a manager (like cutting off patrons or handling sexual harassment).
Take a look at “Dealing With Difficult Customer Situations,” later in this
chapter, for more help.
Knowing exactly how to handle difficult situations takes time and experience.
Your staff members will learn from their mistakes. Don’t hold it against them
if the situation doesn’t turn out perfectly. Each time they tackle a tough situa-
tion they gain skills to make it work better the next time.
Look for positive coaching opportunities. Anyone can go over what an
employee could have done better in a situation. But also take the time to
praise positive customer service situations.
Keeping your employees in the loop
The more your employees know about your business, the more they feel like
it’s their business. And when they think of it as their business, they’re more
invested in seeing it succeed. They, in turn, can spread the information and
enthusiasm to your customers.
194
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

You can keep them up-to-date in all kinds of ways like scheduling brief meet-
ings each shift, holding longer weekly meetings, putting notes in their pay-
check, or posting memos in a centrally located place (like by the time clock,
on a bulletin board, or in an employee locker area). Make sure all staff mem-
bers are getting the same information consistently.
Consider letting your staff in on these important things going on in your bar:
 Upcoming promotions
 New menu items
 Live entertainment schedules
 New game leagues
Take the next step, and get input from your staff about what they think cus-
tomers want to see. They’re in the trenches day in and day out. They may
have another point of view you hadn’t considered. Or maybe your customers
have made suggestions to your staff. Encourage them to share those ideas
with you. You can offer your employees bonuses for new ideas or promotions.
Dealing With Difficult 
Customer Situations
In every business, customer service problems arise. In the bar business, you
often combine a problem with alcohol, and then you have a real recipe for
trouble. In this section, we give you some advice when things just don’t go
the way you’d like them to. We show you how to keep your cool and diffuse
the situation before it becomes a scene.
Handling unhappy customers
People are in a bar to have a good time. In a restaurant, they may be there 
to actually eat, trying to get in and get out, to get on with their busy day. But
in a bar, most people have come to unwind, relax, and hang out a bit. A bar 
is not a necessity; it’s a luxury to be able to take time out of a busy life and
take a load off. As the bar owner, you can’t survive if you can’t keep your 
customers happy. But you will encounter unhappy customers from time to
time. In this section, we give you some tips for handling these situations.
Take a look at Chapter 16 for help in turning customer service problems into
repeat business.
195
Chapter 11: Rule #1: Practicing Good Customer Service

Beware of providing freebies: Complimentary food and free drinks
Don’t just reach for the comp (complimentary) button on your register if you
have a customer service problem. It’s a very dangerous precedent. Each situa-
tion has to be handled differently. Yes, the customer is always right (that’s why
they’re called customers, not people), but comping food or drinks for bad 
service does not usually bring the customer back. If the customer doesn’t want
to pay because his steak was overcooked, make sure he tells you before he’s
eaten three-quarters of it. If the problem is the house’s fault, take the item off
the bill and say, “I am sorry. I hope you will come back and give us another
chance to serve you.” Giving free cocktails to people who weren’t pleased with
their meal does not help you. Try to get them a meal that they love before they
leave, rather than just comping things off their check. Some customers do this
for a living!
On the other hand, it’s also a dangerous precedent to assume your customer
is trying to cheat you. Do what’s right by the guest, and then make sure
you’re not overcooking your steaks. Sometimes it is your fault, and if you are
sincere in your apologies and in correcting the problem, you can have a cus-
tomer for life and a raving fan.
The bartender should never give free cocktails. If you buy a drink for some-
one, always ring it up on the register. If you’re the owner, have the bartender
give you a check for the patron’s drink, and then pay for it. This step stops
people from saying, “When do I get a free drink? When does the house buy
me a drink?” When they see that you have to pay for it, they change that cry!
Problem-solving policy: Timely and private responses
Problems should be taken care of as soon as possible. Don’t let the customer
steam. If the customer is exceptionally agitated, take the person out of the
room to your office and solve the problem. You don’t want to make the situa-
tion worse by causing a scene in front of other customers and your employ-
ees. Remember, you want to solve the problem, not be part of it! Listen to the
patron’s explanation of the problem and ask, “What would you like me to
do?” or “What can I do to help?” The person usually has a solution in mind.
You can go with the patron’s solution or offer your own.
Avoid telling the patron “No.” If you can’t comply with the request, explain
what you can do. “How ’bout if we get you a new server who probably won’t
spill a tray of beers on you, and get you a complimentary T-shirt because
yours is wet?”
196
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Handling intoxicated patrons
Preventing intoxication is everyone’s responsibility. All FOH employees
should feel responsible and accountable to check IDs, watch for signs of
intoxication, and prevent drunk driving. Individual staff members may be
added to any lawsuits filed against the bar if they were involved in serving a
patron who was harmed or harmed another as a result of drinking. People
who do not practice responsible alcohol service can face criminal charges
and civil-court battles, resulting in fines and possibly jail time. This is serious!
The National Restaurant Association (www.restaurant.org) also has a
new “ServSafe” program for alcohol, which will likely become the industry
standard.
Consider getting your staff members TIPS certification (www.gettips.com)
to help them practice responsible, yet customer-friendly, alcohol service.
TIPS stands for Training for Intervention ProcedureS, and the organization
teaches bar and restaurant employees how to prevent intoxication, underage
drinking, and drunken driving. If TIPS doesn’t offer workshops in your area,
you can sign up for online training. In some states, your insurance company
may give you a discount if your employees are certified.
Watching for signs of intoxication
There’s no magic formula for how much a person can drink before he or 
she is intoxicated. Sure, guidelines based on gender, height, and weight 
have been established, but they’re just guidelines. Many things (such as food,
medication, sleep, and so on) can affect how we process alcohol. So, as a bar
owner, you have to resort to the tried-and-(mostly)-true method of observing
your patrons.
Here are the most common signs of intoxication to help you identify poten-
tially intoxicated patrons, but for the most part, you need to use common
sense and judgment to determine who’s had too much to drink. The Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book includes a more-extensive list of behaviors.
 Loud speech
 Ordering drinks rapidly
 Slurred speech
 Stumbling
 Spilling drinks or missing their own mouth when drinking
 Aggressive behavior
197
Chapter 11: Rule #1: Practicing Good Customer Service

Many people who don’t exhibit the common signs of intoxication may, in fact,
be legally intoxicated. You must know the laws in your area, monitor your
staff members, and execute good judgment to serve your clientele and your
community safely.
Intervening with a potentially intoxicated patron
No one likes to be told they’re “drunk.” Before you totally cut a patron off,
consider slowing down alcohol service to the patron.
If a server or bartender is taking steps to slow down service to a patron,
make sure they include you or another manager in the loop. The manager
needs to begin keeping a close eye on the situation to decide the appropriate
next steps.
Here are some ideas for slowing down service:
 Offer the person some food. Food can slow down the absorption 
of alcohol.
 Remove an empty glass or bottle before coming back with the next one.
 Make yourself scarce. Obviously you don’t want to avoid the person, 
but a bartender or server can find ways to take a little longer to make or
serve a cocktail when necessary. Great excuses include “They’re chang-
ing the keg” or “We have to grab _____ in the back” or “He’s restocking
the cooler.” Any reasonable excuse is usually accepted.
 Coach your staff to offer water or nonalcoholic beverages. “Let’s slow
down a bit.”
Cutting off service entirely
If your bartender or server has just a slight feeling that the customer has
been overserved, they should call the manager. Always get the manager
involved before service is stopped. Managers should have experience in 
handling what could be an explosive situation. Also, they can bring a level 
of objectivity to the situation. A customer may not think that a “lowly”
employee, especially a server, has the authority to cut him off. A customer is
more apt to show a manager some level of respect. Definitely let the manager
make the final call and have the awkward conversation with the patron.
Keep these tips in mind when refusing service to a customer:
 Do not cut anyone off in front of others. The manager should invite the
person to the office, or pull him or her aside, to break the news. Keep it
factual, not accusatory. “I think you should call it a night.”
198
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Quietly give the person’s friends the same information. Tell whoever
the person is with that you’re not serving that customer anymore. Do
not get into any negotiation about it.
 Make sure the patron has a ride home. If the person doesn’t, call a cab
and make sure the person gets into it.
 Do not make a big deal out of cutting someone off, but be firm. “Your
last call has come early.” And last call is last call, after all.
Only cut a customer off away from other customers, even his or her friends.
Always. Be discreet; avoid embarrassment. Stop the drinking before it gets to
be a big deal. Only if the customer won’t cooperate should you walk away
and refuse to serve him or her. Check out “What to do with troublemakers,”
later in this chapter, for help.
If you’re having trouble cutting a person off, consider offering to pay for the
person’s drinks, as long as he or she leaves immediately. Make sure the
patron has a way home, either in the form of a cab or a friend. If someone
who’s been drinking gets into a car accident after leaving your bar, you can
be held legally responsible if you or your employees have overserved them.
What to do with troublemakers
Occasionally, when you add alcohol to a good time, it can turn into a not-so-
good time for some patrons. One guy jumps in front of another at the pool
table, or spills the other’s beer, or dances with someone else’s girlfriend. A
host of problems can arise at any time.
Warn the troublemakers fairly amicably. “You guys need to settle down. We’re
having a good time, but we need to stop (insert problem behavior here).”
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you have to 86 someone (or kick the
person out of your bar). Do it as quietly, but forcefully, as possible.
Here are the steps we recommend.
1. Present the tab. Ask the patron firmly, but politely, to pay it and leave.
If the person resists (which he or she probably will), proceed to Step 2.
2. Firmly explain the person’s options.
“We can part ways amicably, or I will call the police.” If you know the
person is intoxicated, call a cab.
199
Chapter 11: Rule #1: Practicing Good Customer Service

3. Assuming the troublemaker pays and leaves, you’re done. If the
person doesn’t leave, call the police.
Again, you want to be discreet and avoid embarrassment. One customer
is a lot less likely to get feisty if you’re not making a big deal of it in front
of others. Ask the guest to follow you outside and explain to him there
that he was being asked to pay his tab and leave.
The police can diffuse the situation before anyone gets hurt.
If you kick out someone who’s causing trouble, never let the person back in
your place.
Only touch a customer in self-defense or to break up a fight. You may restrain
a customer, but you can’t hit him. You can only stop a patron from harming
someone else, or, believe it or not, you could be the subject of a lawsuit.
Whenever possible, avoid touching, pointing at, or pushing anyone in your
bar. Call the police if you need to.

Boning Up on Bar Beverages
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on liquor products
 Making your cocktails better
 Choosing your garnishes
T
he old saying in the bar business was: “They eat you poor and drink you
rich.” We hope this chapter will get you rich, both in knowledge and the
bar cash register.
Choose your products carefully; would you use cheap meat in the kitchen?
It’s important to use quality and recognizable brands at your bar. Irwin Shaw
said in his short story “The Monument,” “Build a monument to your cus-
tomer and your bartender by using only the best for them. Would you give
your best friend inferior products?”
The heart of any bar is the products you pour. The liquor, beer, and wine flow.
People have their favorites, but you, the bar owner, choose what to pour. We
hope to help you make choices about what items fit your bar better.
In this chapter, we get you started with the basics of wine, beer, and spirits.
We help you understand how you pour is as important as what you pour. And
we show you why the details, like ice and garnishes, matter.
Knowing the Bar Basics and Then Some
Every good bartender or bar owner worth her salt rim knows lots about
liquor. Maybe too much in the personal-experience category, in fact, but
we digress. If you don’t feel like you have yet mastered all you need to
know about the products you sell in your bar, this section is a great place
to start.

Wondering about wines
Wine is a beverage made of fermented juice of any kind of fruit. Most popular
wines are made exclusively from grapes. In fact, most wines are named after
the variety of grapes they are made from.
Although wine has been around for thousands of years, it’s been enjoying a
new popularity in the last 30 years in the United States. It’s no longer
reserved for special occasions. And more important to you as a bar owner,
wine is enjoyed by people across all socioeconomic lines, not just a select
few. Thirty years ago, a bar owner could get away without serving wine, but
these days, you should include it on your menu.
A few things contribute to this new era of wine savviness, including increased
disposable income (wine isn’t always cheap, though many good wines are
available at reasonable prices) and greater access to information (like inter-
esting wine lists in local restaurants and books like Wine For Dummies). As
more people eat out more often, the interest in drinking wine will continue
to grow.
In most cases, we recommend you select one or two wines from each cate-
gory to stock your bar. Take a look at Chapter 9 for more help in putting
together your menus. And don’t bother with the old rules about serving wine
(like white wines with fish and chicken, red wines with beef). Today, it’s
about what wines stack up against spicy and strong, or flaky and delicate,
regardless of color.
Wines today are very trendy; today’s Merlot is yesterday’s Chardonnay. (That
is to say, Merlot, the hot red wine for years, is being replaced by Pinot Noir.)
Read your local paper and wine magazines, and of course, talk to your cus-
tomers to keep up with the changing wines and trends.
For more details about wine than we can possibly include in this chapter (or
this book, for that matter), take a look at Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition, by
Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley).
White wines
Sweet, dry, crisp, light, and fruity all describe various white wines popular
today. Many good wines are available at low prices, so work with your sales
reps to find the right ones for your patrons at a price that works for you.
Here’s a list of some of the more popular white wines with brief descriptions.
 Chablis: In the United States, this sometimes inexpensive “jug” wine (lit-
erally, wine that comes in a jug) with a high acidity is made from a blend
of whatever grapes happen to be available. But in the last ten years,
Chablis more often has been made solely from Chardonnay grapes in
the Chablis region of France.

Winemaker Carlo Rossi (actually the company that uses his name) is
trying to gain a new foothold with young, would-be wine drinkers.
They’ve commissioned artwork and furniture made out of recycled jugs
of wine. You can check out their creations (with how-to videos and
downloadable project instructions) at www.jugsimple.com and submit
your own designs at www.myspace.com/carlorossi.
 Chardonnay: This is among the most popular white wines in the U.S.
today. It tends to be a heavier, buttery white wine and can have oaky,
smoky, or sweet tones.
 Pinot Grigio: This Italian-style wine is made from the Pinot Gris grape.
It’s light-bodied and light in color with a fairly neutral taste, bordering
on the crisp and acidic.
 Riesling: Riesling is a sweet wine traditionally produced in the Alsace
region of France, Germany, and Austria. Chile, South Africa, New Zealand,
and the United States now produce good-quality Rieslings as well.
Although it’s definitely on the sweet end of the taste spectrum, many
winemakers put their mark on Riesling by balancing the green flavors
with the acidic overtones by choosing when to harvest their grapes.
 Sauvignon Blanc: This is a crisp, dry, and refreshing white wine grown
all over the world, most notably New Zealand, South Africa, and Chile.
It’s gaining increased popularity as white-wine drinkers look for
Chardonnay alternatives.
 Verdicchio: This Italian-style wine is known for its high acidity and a
characteristic nutty flavor.
For more information, we recommend White Wine For Dummies by Ed
McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley).
Red wines
Red wines vary greatly in terms of flavor, body, and finish. Taste several to
find some that pair with your food and your place. Check out wines at many
different prices to find what best fits your menu and pricing structure.
Here are a few common styles of red wines that you may want to find a home
for in your bar.
 Cabernet Sauvignon: This strong, robust wine features heavy tannins
(acidity) and a strong finish (or lingering flavor). Cabernets age well,
often improving the longer you keep them. Many countries make caber-
net sauvignon, including France, the U.S., Chile, and Argentina.
 Merlot: Plummy, berry flavors define this more medium-bodied wine.
Because the Merlot grape is mild, it’s often blended with stronger
grapes. Italy, California, and France are the most notable Merlot produc-
ers, but more winemakers in Australia, New Zealand, Croatia, and
Slovenia are jumping into the ring.
203
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Bar Beverages

 Pinot Noir: This wine is at least 2,000 years old (the type, not the actual
bottle) and originated in the Burgundy region in France. Although wines
can have vastly different flavors depending on the soil and climates the
grapes are grown in, in general, Pinot Noir is a light- to medium-bodied
wine with an aroma reminiscent of black cherry, raspberry, or currant.
Pinot Noir is a current favorite among red-wine drinkers.
 Shiraz/Syrah: Called Shiraz in New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, in
France and the U.S. it’s known as Syrah. This wine is gaining popularity
among red-wine drinkers thanks to its excellent aroma and blackberry
and chocolate tones. The wine changes substantially based on the soil
the grapes are grown in. So the same grape grown in New Zealand and
Oregon may taste very different.
 Zinfandel: (No, this is not the same as the sweet, pinky-white zinfandel,
although they are made from the same grapes.) Zinfandel is primarily
found in California, though a similar style is available in Europe under the
name Primitivo. It’s a fruity, but not sweet, wine with a full, lush mouthfeel.
Sparkling wines (commonly called Champagne)
All Champagne must be cultivated and fermented in the Champagne region of
France. If it’s made anywhere else, it’s called a sparkling wine instead. Your
average bar patron will still ask for champagne when referring to any sparkling
wine. For more information, we recommend Champagne For Dummies by Ed
McCarthy (Wiley).
Champagne is wine that is fermented a second time after bottling. This second
fermentation produces the fizzy bubbles associated with this celebratory
beverage.
Here are a few terms related to Champagne that may be helpful when you’re
choosing some for your bar.
 Vintage means all the grapes included in the wine are from the same year.
 Nonvintage refers to Champagne that is made from a blend of different
years. Most Champagne is nonvintage.
 Terms like brut, extra dry, sec, demi-sec, and doux refer to the sweetness
of the Champagne, brut being the driest and doux being the sweetest.
 Some Champagne has a pinkish tinge to it, developed as the fermenting
wine spends more time with the grape skins (or tannins). This blush
Champagne can be called blanc de noirs or even rosé.
For most bars a nonvintage brut champagne is your best bet. It’s what people
who don’t drink a lot of champagne expect champagne to taste like. If you’re
more of a trendy bar with a clientele that would be interested in a higher-end
Champagne, consider adding a sec or demi-sec to your list.

Appreciating beer
Beer is among the most popular beverages consumed in bars in this country.
It is brewed from malted barley, hops, and water. Yeast is added, which con-
verts the natural sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide
gives beer its carbonation.
Here’s a list of some beer terms you may have seen on labels or heard in beer
commercials:
 Ale is top-fermented beer (meaning the yeast collects on top of the fer-
menting vat). Pale ales are usually a little bitter, usually taste hoppy, and
generally have a higher alcohol content. Amber ales are sweeter and
milder with less hops.
 Bitter beer is a strong ale, usually English, with a higher-than-normal
alcohol content and as the name implies, a bittersweet taste.
 Bock beer is a dark, strong, slightly sweet lager beer brewed from
caramelized malt.
 Ice beer is brewed at colder-than-normal temperatures and then chilled
to below freezing, forming crystals. The crystals are filtered out, leaving
a smoother-tasting beer with a slightly higher alcohol content.
 Lager is a bottom-fermented beer (meaning the yeast collects at the bottom
of the vat or even the mug after its poured) that is stored at very low
(cold) temperatures for a long period of time (several months). Lager is
the German word for to store.
 Lambic beer is brewed in Belgium. Ingredients such as peaches, rasp-
berries, cherries, and wheat are added during the brewing process.
 Light beer has fewer calories and less alcohol.
 Low-carb beer has less sugar and fewer calories than its regular
counterpart.
 Malt liquor is fermented at a higher temperature than other beers,
which results in a higher alcohol content.
 Pilsner is a light, hoppy, dry lager.
 Sake is beer brewed and processed from rice. (Some consider sake a
wine.) Sake is served warm or at room temperature.
 Stout is an ale produced from heavily roasted barley. It is darker in color
and has a slightly bitter flavor, reminiscent of coffee or dark chocolate.
 Trappist beer is brewed in Belgium or The Netherlands by Trappist
monks. It contains high levels of alcohol and is usually dark in color.
 Wheat beer is made from, um, wheat. It’s usually garnished with a lemon
or orange wedge. Some people add a little raspberry syrup.
205
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Bar Beverages

Unless you plan to use a huge beer selection as a draw, we recommend
choosing about 12 beers to keep on hand. Select three local brews, three
national beers, three light beers, and three imported beers. Don’t forget you
need adequate cold-storage space to store them all. And definitely take a look
at Chapter 8.
Demystifying distilled spirits and liqueurs
The term distilled spirits is a catchall term for liquor with an alcohol content
of 35 percent or more with a low sugar content. Spirits include liquors like
gin, tequila, and whiskey. If a liquor has a 35 percent alcohol content and a
high sugar content, it’s usually known as a liqueur. Grand Marnier, crème de
menthe, and amaretto are familiar liqueurs.
206
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 
Who made the first cocktail?
The true answer is lost to history, but many sto-
ries abound. Most people agree that it’s an
American invention. The earliest printed use of
the term that we can verify was found in the
Hudson, New York, newspaper The Balance and
Columbian Repository on May 6, 1806. The editor
received many questions about the new term,
present in a concession speech from a losing
political candidate, and here was his response:
Cock tail, then is a stimulating liquor, com-
posed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water
and bitters — it is vulgarly called a bittered
sling, and is supposed to be an excellent
electioneering potion inasmuch as it ren-
ders the heart stout and bold, at the same
time that it fuddles the head.
Here are some of the more colorful stories sur-
rounding the creation of this now ubiquitous
beverage:
 Rumor has it that early in American history,
bartenders used to pour remnants of drinks
and almost empty barrels into a single con-
tainer, selling swigs from this mixture to
patrons at a reduced price. “Cock” was
another name for spigot, and “tailings” is
the last bit of alcohol, so this drink was
called “cock-tailings,” quickly shortened to
“cocktail.” A similar story recollects a bar-
tender who poured his dregs into a con-
tainer shaped like a rooster (or cock) and
the tap was set at the cock’s tail, hence
cocktail.
 Some believe that an apothecary in New
Orleans served his guests a mix of brandy,
sugar, water, and bitters in an eggcup, or
cocquetier in French, which was quickly
shortened to “cocktay” and then “cocktail.”
 Alcohol was often used as a medical treat-
ment, rumored to be applied from the tip of
a feather from a cock’s tail; then, when
people started to drink or gargle the medi-
cine outright, the name “cock’s tail” was
still used.
 Betsy Flanagan ran an inn in Yorktown that
was frequented by American and French
soldiers after the American Revolutionary
War. To impress her patrons one evening,
she stole chickens from her neighbor and
served mixed drinks with the chicken feath-
ers sticking out as garnishes. As her guests
became drunken and rowdy, they continued
to call for more “cock tails.”

Hard liquor brings the people in. In this section, we give you a brief explana-
tion and list of products available for your bar. You should consult with your
managers and bartenders about which brands to have available.
 American whiskey: Whiskey distilled from grain or grains. It has a
warm, spicy flavor that warms your whole body on the way down.
 Bourbon: A whiskey that must be made from at least 51 percent corn
and aged in new white-oak barrels. Its flavor is more pure, but still spicy,
than a scotch that’s aged in barrels previously containing other spirits
(like port or sherry).
Tennessee whiskey differs from bourbon in that it’s filtered through
sugar-maple charcoal before it’s aged. The sugar-maple charcoal
makes the difference. Jack Daniel’s is a sour mash whiskey, not a
bourbon.
 Brandy: Made by distilling wine or fruit and then aging in oak barrels.
Brandy can be American or from other parts of the world. The flavor of
brandy varies based on the wine or fruit used, but it tends to be a bit
sweeter than a whiskey but not as sweet as a liqueur.
 Canadian whisky: Whisky from Canada. No “e” in whisky. Canadian
whisky tends to be a little less strong in flavor than American whiskey.
 Cognac: Brandy from the Cognac region of France. Its flavor fully
depends on the wine used to make it.
 Cordials/liqueurs: Made from infusing the flavors of fruits, herbs,
spices, and other plants with a spirit such as brandy, whiskey, schnapps,
or other mildly flavored liquor. There are hundreds of cordials.
 Gin: A distilled-grain spirit flavored from different plants, mainly the
juniper berry. Its flavor reminds us of chewing on pine needles, but in a
good way.
 Irish whiskey: Triple-distilled from barley and other grains, sometimes
in pot stills, and aged between five and ten years. Its flavor is smooth
and mellow and slightly sweet with honey overtones. The Irish have
been distilling whiskey for at least 600 years. God bless ’em!
 Rum: Distilled from sugar cane, it’s closely akin to vanilla. It’s much less
flavorful than vanilla but accepts flavoring easily. It comes in light, dark,
spiced, and flavored.
 Scotch whisky: Whisky (no “e”) from Scotland. It must be distilled in
Scotland, not necessarily bottled there. Its flavor varies widely based
on where it’s distilled, for how long, and how. It’s traditionally aged in
barrels that previously contained other liquor, like sherry or wine. Most
207
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Bar Beverages

quality scotch is described by connoisseurs as smoky and smooth. Scotch
comes in many different varieties. Look for blended (a combination of malt
and grain whiskies) and single malt (from one barrel) scotch.
 Tequila: Produced from the heart of one species of the agave plant. It’s
a tart liquor with a bit of a bite at the finish. Just as Champagne must
come from the Champagne region in France, tequila must come from
Mexico. Tequila not made in Mexico is mezcal.
 Vodka: Distilled from grain, wheat, potatoes, rye, or corn. It’s known to
be flavorless and pairs well with almost any mixer. It is the most called-
for spirit in America.
For more information, sneak a peek at Ray’s Bartending For Dummies,
3rd Edition (Wiley).
Musing over mixers
The term mixers is the classification given to the endless variety of stuff you
add to liquor to make cocktails. The mixer itself isn’t alcoholic, but many
mixers are manufactured solely for the purpose of mixing with alcohol. We
give you more information about how to mix cocktails later in the chapter,
but for now we’re discussing the mixers themselves.
The precise definition of cocktail is debatable. Purists claim that it takes
more than simply mixing alcohol with something else to make it a true cock-
tail. Things like ice-cream drinks, even though they contain alcohol, don’t
make the cut with purists. In most cases, bartenders agree that a drink pre-
pared by mixing liquor with juice or mixers is a cocktail.
Here’s a list of the most common mixers used in cocktails today:
 Club soda: The original neutral fizzy drink.
 Cola and diet cola: Mixes with anything. Most bars choose either Coke
or Pepsi products, but local favorites like RC are getting some shelf 
space.
 Ginger ale: Familiar brands include Canada Dry, Vernors, and
Schweppes.
 Lemon-lime beverages: Familiar brands include 7-Up, Sprite, and
Sierra Mist.
 Milk or cream: Several common cocktails (like toasted almonds and
white Russians) require milk, half and half, or cream. Keep a pint of
vanilla ice cream behind the bar for very creamy cocktails.
208
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Juice: Common cocktail juices include tomato, orange, pineapple, cran-
berry, grapefruit, cream of coconut, lime juice or Rose’s Lime Juice, and
lemon juice or sweet and sour mix. Some purists will suggest fresh-
squeezed juice; of course, it’s better, but much more expensive.
 Tonic water: Some bars keep both tonic and diet tonic in stock.
We recommend that you include these beverages (at least the soft drinks) on
soda guns at your bar. A soda gun system allows you to dispense liquid
mixers, such as sodas and juices, at the touch of a button. It keeps most of
the regularly used mixers handy in one location so you don’t have to manage
any more bottles. Take a look at Chapter 7 for more details on how to get
equipment for your bar.
Don’t forget the other must-have bar essentials, such as bitters (Angostura
brand is our recommendation), Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, superfine
sugar, and salt and pepper. Many recipes call for these ingredients.
 Bitters: For use in Manhattans, Old Fashioneds, and other cocktails
that call for bitters or for cocktails you would like to add a little bitter
flavor to.
 Worcestershire sauce; Mainly for a Bloody Mary or other tomato-based
cocktails.
 Hot sauce: For any cocktail that you want a little spicy or hot! (See www.
tabascofoodservice.com.)

Making sense of the never-ending stream 
of“new” liquors
What this world needs is another vodka. New
products seem to come out every week. We
used to say, “If something falls off a tree, they’ll
make it a flavored vodka or schnapps.”
Liquor companies are always doing research and
testing new flavors and products. Sometimes they
reintroduce old products with new labeling and
bottles. The bar business is an ever-changing
industry, and that’s what makes it interesting
and challenging. Because there will always be
new products, hot new food items, and innovative
cocktails, you will never be bored in the bar
business!
But every time a new product is introduced, the
liquor companies want placement. You can use
this to your advantage by holding an introduc-
tion party at your place. The liquor companies
will give you T-shirts, key chains, stickers, and
other promotional items for your customers.
Everyone likes something for free, and a new-
product launch is a great way to get people in
the door. The more new products, the better for
your place. Work with your sales representative
and let him know you’re interested in promo-
tional nights and tastings for his products.

Mixing and Pouring the 
Best Drinks inTown
If you use the best liquor, the finest juice, and quality mixers, you make the
best cocktails. There is no substitute for quality. But — here comes the but —
you can’t always use premium ingredients because of cost. You have to figure
out whether your customers will pay what it costs you to make the very best.
So in most cases, you have to balance quality and value.
Remember, you’re in this business to make a profit. You will have to charge
according to cost! If your customers will pay, then use only the best of all
products. If your customers won’t pay for the best of the best, you must price
according to cost. That is why they have well, call, premium, and super-pre-
mium products! You get what you pay for. For more information on pricing
your drinks, take a look at Chapter 9.
When you’re ready to start mixing drinks, pick up a copy of Ray’s Bartending
For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley). It includes hundreds of recipes for popular
cocktails and unusual mixed drinks, as well as recipes for nonalcoholic
beverages.
Choosing your pouring strategy
Some bar owners are rigidly insistent on measuring every pour (how much
liquor goes into a drink) and watching every drop, while many customers
think anything less than free pouring every drink is chintzy. Again, it’s all
about balance and consistency. Measuring equals consistency. But there are
several ways to measure your pours without getting out the old jigger every
time. (A jigger is a double-ended measuring cup usually with a 1⁄2-ounce cup
on one end and a 2-ounce cup on the other.)
With technological innovations, you can measure your pours without count-
ing the seconds (two counts = two seconds = about 1 ounce) while you’re
pouring or using a shot glass every time. Here’s a list of tools you can use to
help you pour perfectly measured drinks every time:
 Metered pour spouts: These spouts fit right into your bottles and dis-
pense precisely measured shots each and every time. Take a look at
Precision Pours’s Web site (www.precisionpours.com) for more
information on this easy-to-use tool that can help you control your
product costs.
210
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Computerized liquor-control systems: Check out Easybar (www.
easybar.com) for controls that integrate with your POS (point of
sale) system (or computerized cash register system). Easybar has 
tools that can portion, measure, and dispense beer, alcohol, wine, and
mixers while adding the purchase price to guest checks automatically.
The Warning icon here may be a little too strong, but we want to mention that
using these tools cuts down on the speed of service a bit. Your bartenders
can’t make drinks as quickly with some of these systems in place. And you’ll
always have some customers who complain, “Is that all?! Fill it up!”
Pouring the perfect beer
Although your customers choose a beer based on its taste, you can impress
them by serving an attractive glass of beer. How that glass looks depends on
two things: how clean the glass is and how you pour the beer into the glass.
Following are a few tips for obtaining a clean glass of beer; that is, an eye-
appealing glass filled with a beer with a clear color and a good, tight collar of
foam. A three- or four-sink setup is ideal for getting glasses beer clean; a
three-tank setup is most common. The first tank is for washing, followed by
two rinsing compartments.
A beer glass should be washed each time it is used — unless the customer
requests that his glass be refilled. Proper cleaning and drying can be accom-
plished in four simple steps:
1. Used glasses should be emptied and rinsed with clear water to remove
any foam or remaining beer that will cause dilution of the cleaning
solution.
2. Each glass should be brushed in water containing a solution of odor-
free and nonfat cleaning compound that will thoroughly clean the sur-
face of the glass and rinse away easily in clean water.
3. The glass must then be rinsed twice in fresh, clean, cool water — with
the proper sanitizer in the last tank.
Proper and complete rinsing is most important for a “beer clean” glass.
4. Dry glasses upside down on a deeply corrugated surface or stainless-
steel glass rack.
Never towel-dry glasses. Store air-dried glasses away from sources
of unpleasant odors, grease, or smoke that is emitted from kitchens,
restrooms, or ashtrays.
211
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Bar Beverages

The right head of foam gives a glass of beer that essential eye appeal. You
control the size of the head by the angle at which you hold the glass at the
beginning of the draw. If you hold the glass straight so the beer drops into
the bottom, a deep head will result. If you tilt the glass sharply so the beer
flows down the side, the head of foam will be minimized.
For most beer glasses — and to please most customers — the head should be
allowed to rise just above the top of the glass without spilling over and then
settle down to a 3⁄4-inch or 1-inch head of frothy, white foam.
Another secret to serving a perfect glass of beer: Rinse the glass with cold,
fresh water just before filling with draft beer.
Maintaining your draft beer equipment
To make sure you’re selling perfect “brewery fresh” draft beer, you also need
to pay attention to proper refrigeration, cleanliness of the dispensing equip-
ment, and proper pressures.
Because draft beer is perishable, it must not be exposed to warm tempera-
tures. The retailer must preserve it by providing equipment that will maintain
the temperature of the beer in the barrel between 38 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit.
When you’re storing and pouring your beer, you must also maintain these tem-
peratures throughout your dispensing equipment so the beer that you serve
to your customers will also be 38 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature
range seems to satisfy the majority of tastes and is too small a variation to
affect its flavor or quality.
Just as it’s important to keep your beer glasses clean (see the previous sec-
tion), you have to make sure your dispensing equipment stays free from dirt
and buildup. You need to thoroughly clean the beer faucets, tubing, hose,
coils, taps, and vents, including direct-draw systems, on a regular basis.
You need to keep beer that’s on tap at the proper pressure to maintain its
brewery-fresh taste and natural carbonation. The pressure of the dispensing
equipment must correspond to the normal carbonation of the beer at its tem-
perature in the barrel. The size and length of the coil in the dispensing equip-
ment will determine what pressure you should use.

Considering the importance of ice
Ice matters more than you may think. To get good ice, you need a good water
purifier and a cube shape and size to your liking. Take a look at Figure 12-1 to
see a few varieties of ice cube sizes.
Some purists (often people who’ve never owned bars or worked at a busy
bar) think you should chop your own ice to make cocktails. Don’t believe the
hype. It’s slow and impossible.
A small, crushed-ice machine can be handy if you make a lot of blended or
frozen cocktails. At a minimum, you need an ice machine in the back. Don’t
make your cubes too big. But for shaking cocktails, many bartenders will tell
you big is better. Honestly, it’s a matter of opinion.
You can find ice machines that make ice in many sizes: full, half, cubelets,
nuggets, flakes, and crushed. Two of the best ice-machine manufacturers are
Manitowoc (www.manitowocice.com) and Kold-Draft (www.kold-draft.
com). Take a look at Chapter 7 for more help on choosing equipment for
your bar.
You should, if possible, have one ice machine behind the bar that can make
ice and be used for storage, and one machine in the back of the house that
can be stacked (or have additional units stacked on top of the existing unit),
so as your business grows you can make more ice by stacking.

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Bar Beverages

Shaking versus stirring
The main reasons for shaking a cocktail is to make the ingredients cold, com-
bine them all, and maybe put a head on the cocktail. Stirring a cocktail mixes
the ingredients but doesn’t create any foam in the drink.
As a general rule, you shake cloudy drinks and stir clear ones. Obviously
there are exceptions, because 007 likes his martinis (clear!) “shaken, not
stirred.”
Shake cloudy cocktails and stir clear cocktails. Never, never, shake a cocktail
with any type of carbonation (soda, champagne). It will spray foam every-
where. It can be a great way to welcome a new bartender to your crew.
Prettifying Drinks with Garnishes
Garnishes, those little decorations that add color or flavor to a drink, can
make or break a cocktail. What’s a Bloody Mary without a crisp and cool
celery spear? Or a gin and tonic without a lime or three? In some cases the
garnish defines the cocktail (the difference between a Gibson and a martini is
the cocktail onion, after all).
The most important point to remember about your garnishes is that they
should be fresh and clean. We talk about different types of garnishes in the
next sections. Use your imagination to decide what garnish you put with
what drink, but always consider price and freshness. It may be a great idea
to garnish every Bloody Mary with a skewer of marinated vegetables and 
deli meats, like a little antipasto on a stick. But if the cost of the garnish eats
into your profit margin, you can’t serve it for long! For more on pricing your
drinks (and covering all your costs), check out Chapter 9.
Having fun with citrus fruit
Citrus fruits can garnish anything from a Long Island Iced Tea to a wheat
beer. Here are a few common cuts of many of your favorite citrus fruits and
how to use them:
 Wedges: A wedge is a section of a citrus fruit, usually one-eighth of the
fruit, sliced lengthwise. Take a look at Figure 12-2 to see how this looks.
Here are the basic steps to create wedges:
214
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

1. Slice the fruit in half the long way.
If you commonly hang your wedges on the edge of a glass, go
ahead and cut a notch in them now. Make a small cut the short way
across the inside of each half at this point. Make sure you don’t
completely cut through the fruit’s peel or you’ll cut the wedges in
half, rather than notching them.
2. Lay the cut halves down (peel side up) and halve them the long
way again.
3. Cut each of those halves the long way to create eight wedges
total.
 Wheels: A wheel is a full circle of fruit, placed on the edge of a glass. You
make wheels simply by cutting the ends off the citrus fruit, then slicing
the fruit the short way to the desired thickness. Make a cut from the
middle of the fruit slice to one side to create a slit to hang the fruit on
the rim of the glass.
 Squeezes: A squeeze is very similar to a wedge, but smaller. In fact, it’s
half the size. Make wedges as pictured in Figure 12-2, and then cut those
wedges in half the short way. Rather than hanging on the side of a glass,
a squeeze is squeezed into the cocktail by the bartender, and then
dropped in the drink.
 Twists: A twist is a small piece of the peel of a citrus fruit. Take a look at
Figure 12-3 for tips on how to cut these.
1. Cut off both ends of the fruit.
2. Insert a sharp knife or spoon between the rind and the meat of
the fruit and carefully separate them.
3. Cut the rind into strips.

Other must-have garnishes
To make a perfect cocktail you must have the perfect garnish. Many gar-
nishes are traditional, but innovative barkeeps can use their creativity to
exceed the patron’s expectation. Add the ribbon on the package; it always
helps to garnish your cocktail because it upgrades the appearance and
makes for a complete presentation.
Here’s our list of other basic garnishes and how you can use them:
 Flags: A flag is a maraschino cherry wrapped in an orange slice and then
stabbed with a sword to hold it all together. Use them to garnish things
like Amaretto Sours.
 Olives and olive juice: Olives are the traditional garnish for martinis.
Add a little olive juice to make a martini “dirty.”
 Celery: It’s a garnish and stir stick in one! Use these to garnish Bloody
Marys and the host of related drinks like Bloody Bulls, Bloody Caesars,
and so on.
 Onions: This garnish is the differentiating factor between a martini and
a Gibson.
 Mint: Whether you muddle it for a Mojito or use it to top off a Razzberry
Lemonade, this herb is becoming a must-have for many bars.
 Cherries: When all else fails, toss a cherry in it.
 Strawberries: Notch these superfoods and hang them on the edge of
anything fruity.

Rimming: Why, when, and how to do it
Rimming is coating the rim of a glass with a granular or crumb-like substance
as a garnish. It adds a decorative touch that improves the presentation of the
cocktail and complements its flavor. The most basic example of rimming is
using salt on the rim of a margarita.
Bartenders are becoming much more creative with rimming choices (like
cocoa, graham-cracker crumbs, or shaved coconut), but the most common
rimmers are sugar and kosher salt. Prime cocktail candidates for rimming
include margaritas and martinis, but that’s not an absolute rule. You can
used toasted coconut to grace the rim of a Piña Colada, salt on a Bloody Mary
or Salty Dog, or superfine sugar on the edge of a Screwdriver. Your imagina-
tion is your only limitation.
Here are the basic steps for rimming a glass:
1. Moisten the rim of the glass.
Choose a complementary flavor to enhance the cocktail. Many people
choose a lime wedge or Triple Sec to rim a margarita, or Kahlua to rim a
Chocolate Martini, for example.
2. Dip the moistened rim into whatever you want to coat the glass with.
Gently turn the glass as you coat it to ensure you coat it evenly.
3. Shake off any excess.
4. Fill the glass with your cocktail.

Getting Ready for Your Grand
Opening, Step by Step
In This Chapter
 Setting up your timeline
 Checking things off your master to-do list
E
very bar is different, and every bar owner goes through a slightly differ-
ent process of getting ready for the grand opening. However, bar owners
tend to follow a series of steps when preparing for the big day. Sure, you can
figure out these steps through trial and error, but there’s nothing wrong with
being prepared and making your grand opening as smooth and successful as
possible.
In this chapter, we give you a series of steps to follow to help you plan for
your bar’s opening, with a detailed timeline of all the tasks you need to
accomplish and keep track of before you open the doors and serve your first
drink. Everything in this chapter is covered in detail somewhere else in the
book, but here we give you an idea of how the information in those chapters
fits together to get you ready for opening night. From deciding what your 
signature cocktail might be to choosing a new logo, if it’s important in the
startup cycle of a new bar, it’s in this chapter.
Every bar is different, so every opening timeline varies. If you’re building 
a bar from scratch, you have more steps (and a longer timeline) than if you
take over an existing place. This chapter is intended to be a guideline. Check
with all relevant state and local government and regulatory offices to deter-
mine how long it takes to get the paperwork you need to open the kind of 
bar you want . . . keeping in mind that the processing time may be longer
than quoted. Take a look at Chapters 2 and 4 in particular for help in 
getting started.

Figuring Out How Much Time 
You Need to Prepare
Early in the planning stages, you may need to adjust your timeline and go
with the flow, accepting the fact that timelines aren’t always set in stone. 
You may not need to have your business plan completed nine months before
your opening if you’re taking over an existing, established restaurant and
don’t want to make any changes to it, for example. As you get closer to 
opening day, you need to create and stick to a firm schedule to get every-
thing completed on time.
If you’re terrible at keeping a timeline, pad your schedule. This approach is
similar to setting your clocks 15 minutes ahead to be on time. But in this case,
time is money. If you hire the chef a month earlier than scheduled, it’s an addi-
tional expense you’ll absorb before you’re even open. You may have a very
good reason, and it may be the right thing to do. Just make sure that you factor
the additional time and money into your schedule and expense projections.
In the sections that follow, we group together similar tasks at each time inter-
val. Use these categories to stay organized and eventually to delegate to the
person in your organization who will handle the functions permanently.
Remember, you won’t have tasks in every category at every point on the
timeline. In fact, depending on your concept you may decide to skip some
categories (like construction if your physical layout is already perfect) 
altogether. Pick which tasks are necessary for you to complete your bar.
Here’s the list of categories we use, shown in the order they appear in each
time interval:
 Administration: Administration tasks include paperwork, phone calls,
planning activities, and so on.
 Construction: Construction tasks consist of work related to designing
and building your restaurant.
 Human resources: Anything concerning hiring, training, or managing
your employees falls in this category.
 Purchasing: Purchasing tasks include buying equipment, supplies, and
just about anything else your restaurant needs to get up and running.
 Front of the house (FOH): Tasks in this category include organizing your
bar, establishing your hours of operation, and all forms of customer 
service.
 Back of the house (BOH): BOH tasks include organizing your storeroom
and placing and receiving your first food orders.
220
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Advertising and promotion: This category includes any publicity,
advertising, and public relations duties you should do.
 Research: Research is ongoing and forever. We list ideas to help you
stay competitive and to reform and refresh your plans as you go along.
One Year Out: Planning!
Planning, planning, planning. Just by picking up a copy of this book you’ve
started the planning phase. Use this time early in your schedule to thor-
oughly research your ideas, articulate your concept and vision, and put
together a comprehensive plan for achieving it. At this point in the process,
your main concerns should involve administrative duties and, yes — believe
it or not — research.
Here are the issues that you should address at this time:
 Construct a detailed and professional business plan. Consult Chapter 5
for details on creating an effective business plan for your bar.
 Get the details for what it takes to get a liquor license in your area.
Because it’s essential and the requirements vary widely from state to
state, county to county, and city to city, get the lowdown on what you
need to run your business well in advance. Take a look at Chapter 3 for
help getting started. And Appendix A gives you a listing of all the state
liquor control boards.
 Develop your logos, trademarks, and brand identity. Chapter 4 helps you
figure out exactly what you want to be. Consider hiring a graphic artist
at this stage to help you create marketing images for your bar. Chapter 6
gives you tips on choosing a name for your place.
 Put together your team of advisors, including an accountant, an attor-
ney, and an insurance agent. Take a look at Chapter 3 for details. Get
your architect and designer on board, if you’re using them.
 Check with the local governing agencies to confirm timelines for your
permits (beyond your liquor license). Requirements and schedules vary
greatly, so get the details as soon as you can and account for them in
your schedule. See Chapter 3 for details on how to get started.
We mentioned doing research earlier. What kind of research, you ask? Well,
research really should be an ongoing habit as long as you’re a bar owner, but
at this point, the purpose of the research is to take advantage of your bar’s
market potential.
221
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

You really should create a plan that ensures that your bar takes advantage of
everything that could affect it — accepted pricing structures, for example —
and stay on top of the competition. Study other bars in your area to know
what they’re doing and how it’s working. Watch how customers respond
(both positively and negatively) to specials, entertainment, and menu
changes to help you figure out how to improve on your own ideas. In other
words, you need to formalize your process for conducting market, trend, and
competitive research. See Chapter 5 for suggestions on watching the compe-
tition and Chapter 16 for tips on building and keeping a bar crowd.
Nine Months Out: Finding Funds, 
a Location, and POS Systems
At the nine-months-and-counting mark, you should have your business plan
in hand and be shopping for money. You can also begin researching specifics
for your business, such as looking at prospective locations and getting infor-
mation about computer systems.
Start meeting with potential investors. Explain your concept, business plan,
and financial forecasts. Check out Chapter 3 for more information about financ-
ing your business, and see Chapter 5 for help creating your business plan.
You should also research point of sale (POS) systems. Much more than a
simple cash register, a POS system can help you track and analyze just about
any type of data you can think of. Some of the super–high-end machines can
actually control your liquor pours too. Check out Chapter 12 for info on con-
trolling your costs with measured pours.
You also need to start shopping for the perfect location for your bar (see
Chapter 6).
Seven Months Out: Signing the 
Lease and Setting Up Finances
Around seven months, your plan starts to become reality. Finalize your
choice for a location and sign your lease. Get your money together and set up
your bank accounts, look into credit card processors, and develop your other
financial systems.
222
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Here are the administration issues that you should address at this time:
 Sign a deal with the landlord. But take a look at Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6,
first to make sure that your location meets all your objectives and
requirements for your concept and sales projections.
 Finalize your financing. Check out Chapter 3 for the full story.
 Set up business bank accounts to pay deposits, rent office space (if you
need it), and deposit all your investors’ money. See Chapters 3 and 15
for help.
 Decide how you will get cash from the bar into your bank account. You
can use an armored car service (a service that comes to you to pick up
your deposits complete with armed guards and an armor-plated vehicle)
or make a daily deposit at your local bank.
 Establish your plan for regular financial reporting. Create the format for
your P&L (profit and loss) statement and any other reports you’ll create
on a regular basis. Check out Chapter 15 for the story on what numbers
to watch and why.
Don’t forget your ongoing research duties! Here’s what you should do now, in
terms of research:
 Research credit card processing systems. Kindly turn to Chapter 15.
 Check out potential payroll companies. Weigh your options for contract-
ing with a company or doing it yourself. Chapter 15 can get you started.
Six Months Out: Getting Organized!
Your biggest task at this point is to get — and stay — organized. Get your per-
mits, licenses, and other legalities straightened out. Set up your temporary
base of operations. And do your homework to figure out what equipment you
need and whom you should buy it from.
Here are your administration issues for now:
 Set up water, electricity, gas, and other required utilities. Make sure that
the billing is set up and the utilities are on before construction begins.
 Complete paperwork for permits and licenses. Figure out which permits
your contractor will handle and which you must apply for on your own.
223
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

Depending on the laws in your area, you may need to apply for your
liquor license sooner. Most governing boards require that you have the
bar’s permanent location before they issue the license. If you change
locations, you’ll likely need to reapply for your license. And in some
places, a finite number of licenses are available; once they’re gone,
they’re gone. Definitely take the time to find out the specifics on what
you need in your area. Check out Chapter 3 for details on liquor licenses
and other legalities.
 Set up your temporary office space. You can use a space in your bar
that’s somewhat secluded or away from the construction noise. You may
choose to work out of your home or even a trailer outside the bar while
it’s under construction. You need a space with electricity, lights, some
form of climate control, desk space, a land-based phone line, and
Internet access.
Get a fax machine earlier rather than later for exchanging plans with
architects, designers, and so on. You can also use it to send and receive
certain documents, such as specifications for equipment and résumés
from management candidates.
And if you don’t already have a computer, now’s the time to get one.
A computer is essential for doing research, ordering, creating all the
manuals you’ll need, and developing your menu.
Another issue you have to start working on now, particularly if you’re 
building your bar, is construction! Here’s what you need to do:
 Interview your contractor candidates. Check out Chapter 4 for informa-
tion on working with a contractor.
Make sure that you give your contractor your full specifications and
your schedule. Make him or her commit to a detailed schedule in writing
to confirm a completion date, with a financial penalty attached for not
meeting the deadline. If your contractor gives you any resistance, con-
sider adding a graduated incentive bonus if they finish early.
 Review your plans for the BOH, FOH, and exterior of your bar to make
sure they fit your actual space. Take a look at Chapter 6 for help.
You also need to start researching equipment suppliers and sourcing equip-
ment. Make sure to consider new versus used equipment and buying versus
leasing options. Chapter 7 can help you.

Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Five Months Out: Building and Buying
Construction begins on your new site! Interview candidates for your key posi-
tions, such as your managers or head bartender, assuming that you’re not
either or both of them. Use any available time to work on manuals, job
descriptions, and anything else you can get out of the way early.
If you’re building your bar, or remodeling an old one, here are your construc-
tion issues at this time:
 Begin construction. This schedule may be too soon or too late, depend-
ing on your operation. Make sure you’ve researched all your permits and
they’re in place when they need to be. Chapter 3 can help.
 Make sure that you and your contractor are still on the same page
regarding the concept, the design, and the schedule and that anyone
else involved with the process (such as designers) shares your thoughts
in these areas.
You knew that at some point you had to start buying the stuff that goes into
your bar, right? Well, now’s the time to get started. Here’s what you should do
at this time:
 Order your bar and kitchen equipment. Chapter 7 has all the details.
 Order your tables, chairs, and fixtures. Specify delivery for 30 days
before opening. This schedule gives you time to allow for shipping 
and delivery delays. Take a peek at Chapter 6 for help in choosing 
your décor.
 Purchase the POS system.
It’s also time to start hiring people! Here’s what you need to do now:
 Interview manager and head bartender candidates. Flip on over to
Chapter 10 for more info.
 Develop job descriptions and pay rates. Take a look at Chapter 10 
for help.
Also be sure to investigate phone systems and phone service companies at
this time, and remember that all systems are not created equal.
225
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

Four Months Out: Manuals and Menus
Construction is well underway. Use this time to work on employee and 
operational manuals and finish up your drink menus. Check out the sidebar
“Things to do in your free time,” later in this chapter, to find tasks that you
can complete now to save yourself time later. Four months out, here’s every-
thing you need to do:
 Check in with your contractor to make sure that construction is 
proceeding according to schedule.
 Finalize exterior construction.
 Create employee and operational manuals. Spend some time in 
Chapter 10 for some direction on what to include in your manuals.
 Finalize job descriptions and pay rates. Chapter 10 can help.
 Finalize your drink menus. Take a look at Chapter 9 for tips.
 Finalize your hours of operation. It’s best to get this out of the way
before you hire your staff so they can immediately coordinate their
schedules with the bar’s schedule.
 Research pest control companies. Set up a regular schedule for treat-
ment after you’re up and running. Take a look at Chapter 17 for help 
running a safe bar.
Three Months Out: Supervisors, 
Suppliers, and Vendors
During this period, most construction should be finishing up. You can start
looking at supervisors and managers now. Research your suppliers and ven-
dors at this stage of the game. You’re still planning, but the planning really
becomes a reality now. Here’s what you should do:
 BOH construction should be complete. FOH construction may be ongoing.
Don’t install your FOH floor until the end of construction. Putting off the
floor installation until as late as possible in your construction cycle mini-
mizes construction-related dirt and damage.
 Review résumés for supervisors and managers.
 Start sourcing food and beverage purveyors. Check out Chapter 8 to
know what to order and Chapter 14 for tips on managing your inventory.
226
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Revise the advertising and promotion plan you developed for your busi-
ness plan. Work with any outside public relations professionals you’re
hiring. Check out Chapter 16 for advice on getting the word out and
growing your business.
 Research your music options. Chapter 6 can get you started.
Two Months Out: Preparing to Hire,
Attending to Details
It’s time to turn your attention to hiring your staff. At two months, you need
to create your plans for hiring, training, scheduling, and retaining your new
team. Here’s what you should do:
 Hire any other supervisors or managers.
 Create a blank interviewing roster for both the FOH and BOH. Look to
Chapter 10 for details.
 Create a schedule for these hiring milestones:
• Initial interview
• Second interview
• Hiring
• Orientation
 Create a training schedule
• Steps of service (greeting, drink orders, offering food menus, 
and the like)
• Product training (menu, beverage, theme, and so on)
• POS
• Menu tastings
• Equipment training (dishwasher, blender, food processor, coffee
machine, and any other equipment you have)
 Finalize employee manuals. Chapter 10 is a great resource for this 
information.
 Coordinate outside trainers (most likely liquor salespeople) as necessary.
 Order any merchandise (like T-shirts, hats, or beer mugs) you plan to
sell to customers. Order any customized uniform items, such as aprons
or shirts.
227
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

Another serious thing to keep in mind two months out — you should have
your liquor license in hand. You should also be working on any purchasing
tools, like ordering procedures and forms, that you’ll use after you’re up and
running.
Here are other things you should do during this stage:
 Make the final food menu adjustments. See Chapter 9 for help making
the hard decisions on what to tweak and what to cut.
 Follow up on any outstanding permits or licenses. Check out Chapter 4
for info on licenses, permits, and other legalities.
 Finalize your music program. See Chapter 6 for details.
 Review and approve your drink menus. Let Chapter 9 be your guide.
 Finalize your operational manuals. Chapter 10 gives you the scoop on
setting up manuals to operate your bar with ease.
 Set up your trash service, including dumpsters and grease removal,
recycling, and pest control services.
 Activate the phone lines in your bar. You may choose to do this later in
the month, especially if you have office space somewhere else. Choose
an on-hold message.
 All FOH areas should be completed at this time.
 Create purchasing sheets with exact specifications of all products.
Chapters 8 and 14 give you a head start on selecting and organizing your
inventory.
 Review all printed materials, trademarks, and proprietary marks.
Approve the specifications on all signage, business cards, menus, 
advertising, takeout bags and containers, letterhead, matches, 
beverage napkins, and stirrers.
 Finalize all purchasing agreements with purveyors.
 Work with BOH to finalize smallwares order list and quantities. Take a
look at Chapter 7 to figure out what you need.
 Create your purchasing forms. Check out Chapter 14 for examples.
 Create your purchase order for linens.
 Finalize your promotional campaign. Look at Chapter 16 for help.
 Create a guest list, ready invitations, and finalize plans for your 
preopening party.
228
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

Six Weeks Out: Finalizing All Paperwork
Use this time to make sure that you have all the paperwork, training materi-
als, and schedules ready when your prospective employees walk through the
door. Set the expectation that you operate a professional, organized, and
well-run business and that you expect nothing less from them. Here’s what
you need to do:
 Create a construction punch list, or a list of unfinished items that must be
completed before opening.
 Print and collate your final employee manual.
 Make sure that you have all hiring paperwork in house, including appli-
cations, government-required forms (such as the I-9 and W-4s), uniform
agreements, emergency-contact cards, training materials, and so on.
Check out Chapter 10 for the details.
 Review controls for maintaining optimum inventory levels while maxi-
mizing cash flow and for minimizing your risk of theft. Take a look at
Chapter 14 to get the full story.
 Design and lay out your physical menu. See Chapter 9.
Thirty Days Out: Navigating 
the Final Month
The last month is a hectic one. You clean every square inch of your new bar.
You set it up exactly the way you want it to look. Take pictures because you’ll
be setting the standard for how both the BOH and FOH should look before
and after every single shift. You hire and train most of your opening staff
during this crazy time, so make sure that you’ve set up your interviewing and
hiring systems in the weeks beforehand to minimize the chaos and maximize
the information transfer.
Here’s your list of things to do:
 Follow up on outstanding punch-list concerns.
 Start the hiring process for general employees. Place your ad and set up
interviews at your location. Chapter 10 guides you through the process
of hiring and training your employees.
229
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

 Place food orders for delivery two to three weeks before your opening.
Coordinate the delivery so you have time to train employees on food
prep and menu tastings.
 Thoroughly clean all FOH spaces, including restrooms, dining areas, the
patio, the lobby (if you have one), the bar, and the lounge to get rid of
any lingering construction dust and dirt.
 Set up all furniture and fixtures.
 Set up the managers’ office.
 Finalize the table settings. See Chapter 7 for more info.
 Run a final test of all equipment (assemble it as it comes in).
 Thoroughly clean the kitchen, storerooms, and coolers to get rid of any
lingering construction dust and dirt.
 Unpack, wash, and store all smallwares.
 Set up all storerooms.
 Get your signage in place.
 Send invitations for your preopening party.
Ten Days Out: Fine-Tuning
T minus ten days means more of the same. You may be “just” the project
manager at this point, overseeing the schedule to make sure that everyone is
doing his or her job (rather than doing any of the jobs yourself). All employ-
ees should be hired by this point. Engage your staff’s help in setting up your
bar and assembling your menus. Continue to train and test your staff to make
sure that they know your menu and processes in time for opening day.
Here’s what you need to do now:
 Follow up on outstanding punch-list concerns.
 Continue setting up new-employee files.
 Continue adding new employees to the POS and payroll systems.
 Continue training and testing your employees on products, processes,
and procedures. Test all FOH employees on menu knowledge, steps 
of service, table numbers, and so on, and test all BOH employees on 
station-specific menu items, station setup and tear down, and sanitation
procedures.
230
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 

 Place your beverage order.
 Receive your beverage order.
 Set up your bar.
 Print and collate your final menu.
Three Days Out: Dress Rehearsal!
Are you getting excited? Your bar should be in full working order by this
point. All your employees should know your drink and food menus inside 
and out. Each line cook should know how to make everything on her station.
Here’s what to do:
 Follow up on outstanding punch-list concerns.
 Continue setting up new-employee files.
 Continue adding new employees to the payroll systems, including 
time clocks.
 Conduct your first trial run. Some people call them dry runs, soft 
openings, or a host of other names. Before you actually open, you 
invite employees’ families, friends, investors, advisors, consultants, 
and others to try out the bar.
You treat them just like regular diners, only they eat and drink for free.
We recommend a two-drink maximum and one entree or appetizer per
person. This is a chance for you to go through a practice shift and see
how everything works together. You’ll likely have a few things to iron out
between your trial run and opening day, which is exactly why you do it.
Trial runs aren’t cheap, but they’re well worth the money.
The Day Before: Relaxing 
before the Big Opening
Hopefully, you’re having a fairly relaxed day. If you’ve followed the steps in
this chapter and kept everything on schedule, everything should be under
control at this point. You can even have a little celebration tonight to congrat-
ulate your team for a job well done. Make sure you don’t let it go on too late;
you want them fresh for the big day.
231
Chapter 13: Getting Ready for Your Grand Opening, Step by Step

Here’s all you should have to do today:
 Follow up on outstanding punch-list concerns.
 Continue setting up new-employee files.
 Continue adding new employees to the payroll systems, including to
time clocks.
Most importantly, give yourself a pat on the back — your bar is ready, and so
are you!
232
Part III: Employees, Customers, and Products: Managing the “Right Stuff” 
Things to do in your free time
Okay, we know free time in the bar business
doesn’t happen, but some tasks associated with
opening a new bar can really be done earlier or
later in the process, depending on when you
have time. It’s simply a matter of choice.
Consider getting some of these out of the way
early in your timeline. Your to-do list can quickly
become unmanageable if you leave them all
until the last couple of months.
 Set up your training schedule. Rough out
how many days you plan to have employees
in the restaurant and what they might do on
those days. Because you’re setting up a bar
rather than a restaurant, your staff probably
doesn’t need as much training as they oth-
erwise might. Usually a week total is more
than enough.
 Establish your procedures for handling
cash, ordering, requisition, and receiving.
 Set up your credit card agreements.
 Figure out how you’re going to get your
money into your account. Are you going to
schedule an armored-car pickup or deposit
it yourself every day?
 Develop any reports and forms you’ll use.
Take a look at Chapter 15 for help in figuring
out which numbers to watch and why.
 Research your music program. Take a look
at Chapter 6 for help in deciding which
musical choices best fit your bar.
 Interview pest control companies. They’re
one of those unmentionable necessities.
 Investigate phone companies and phone
systems.
 Research printers for letterhead, advertis-
ing or promotional materials, matches, nap-
kins, and anything else you’d like to print
with your logo.
 Develop your employee manual. One of those
must-dos that can mostly get done early.
 Write job descriptions and establish pay
rates for job classes.
 Develop your payroll processes. Decide
whether you’re doing it yourself or hiring an
outside service.

Part IV
Managing
Your Inventory,
Revenue, and
Future

In this part . . .
A
fter you have everything you need for your bar and
you get your business going, how do you make the
most of it? This part is your guide to making sure your
bar is financially sound and then some. We give you tools
to help you turn bottles of liquor into buckets of cash.
We help you create things like procedures, reports,
and processes to track and control your inventory and
purchasing. (Trust us, it’s not as painful as it sounds!)
And, most importantly, we show you how to keep your
patrons happy, bring in new customers, and turn them
into regulars.

Chapter 14
Controlling Expenses and
Operating Efficiently
In This Chapter
 Buying your products at the right price
 Keeping an eye on inventory
 Staying vigilant at all times
Your biggest ongoing, controllable expenses in the bar business are your
food and beverage products. You can make or lose money simply by
managing these expenses, so you need to make sure you do so effectively.
In this chapter, we help you keep control of several key areas of your bar
business to maximize your profits. We show you how to buy your products
effectively. We help you keep track of the products after they make their way
to you (along with tips on what to do if they get lost along the way). And we
help you make sure that your products reach your patrons without ending up
in the trash or in someone else’s pocket.
Perusing the Power of Purchasing
Purchasing means buying anything you need for your bar, including liquor,
wine and spirits, other beverages, equipment, paper goods, tables, silver-
ware, and everything else. Paying the lowest price possible for the highest-
quality products ultimately makes you more money.
Because you typically buy equipment fairly infrequently, most of this
chapter focuses on buying food, beverages, and paper goods. (If you need
help buying equipment, take a look at Chapter 7.) If your bar is like most
restaurants, you spend not only lots of time but also lots of money buying

these types of supplies. But you can definitely apply these same principles
and tips to negotiating for and purchasing anything else you need for your
place.
Appoint only a few key personnel to buy products for the bar (like the head
chef, head bartender, manager, and yourself). You all must work together
on this. The more people who are buying for your bar, the more likely that
you will lose control. It can cost you a bundle in unnecessary or wasted
products.
Putting together your list of supplies
Just like you make a shopping list before you head to the grocery store,
you need to put together a comprehensive list of what items you need to
run your bar before you can start buying. Take a look at a sample list in
Table 14-1. Please also refer to Chapter 8 for items that you should keep
in stock.
Here are some tips for setting up your own list:
 Include all the liquor you need (including brand name and bottle
sizes). Chapter 8 gives you details about specific types and brands
of liquors that can work for your bar. We also cover recommended
quantities in that chapter.
 Add all the ingredients necessary to make your menu items. Be as
specific as you can. If you need your mozzarella cheese for pizza to
come to you already shredded, specify it.
 Include everything else your bar needs, such as paper goods, light
bulbs, and glassware. Make sure that you know what paper towels fit
your dispensers, which light bulbs fit your fixtures, and whether you
need to buy ashtrays. If you run a smoke-free bar, ashtrays are a waste
of money.
 Group like items into categories. Most suppliers group products with
common classifications, like baked goods, dairy products, and so on.
This step makes it easier to keep your purchasing and inventory sys-
tems in synch.
 Estimate how much you think you’ll need. Based on your recipes and
menu items, and how much you think you’ll sell of each item during a
week, create your projected weekly sales volume. This number tells you
how much of an item to order.

Don’t worry if you can’t fill in every detail on your list, like the unit size,
before you speak to your first sales rep. Start with your menu specifications
and your projected sales volumes to figure out how much of the specific
items you need. Then you can work with sales reps to get the best prices for
your specific quantities, in a volume that is realistic for your business. When
you’re first starting out, you have to be flexible and follow a trial-and-error
approach.
Use your supply list to create your inventory control sheets and save your-
self some time. Take a look at “Maintaining Your Bar’s Inventory” later in this
chapter for help.
When you’re drawing up your supply list, consider prep time as a factor.
Many bars don’t have a huge kitchen staff to spend hours and hours prepar-
ing every item on the menu from scratch. And your patrons and concept
likely don’t require “from scratch” quality in all things. For example, the local
Italian joint down the street may hand-bread mozzarella triangles before
deep-frying them and serving them with freshly grated parmesan cheese and
house-made marinara sauce. But you may decide to go with a terrific, com-
mercially prepared cheese stick that goes right from the freezer to the fryer
and is served up with a canned marinara sauce. Both products are quality
products from the patrons’ standpoint. The Italian joint’s version probably
costs them less in raw goods but is more expensive in terms of the labor dol-
lars to create it. Your version is more expensive from your distributor, but
you save money in preparation time.
237
Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Finding the best suppliers for your bar
Now that you know what you need, find out what’s available from different
suppliers. Because food-service brands are typically not mentioned on menus,
you have quite a bit of flexibility in deciding whom to buy food products from.
No one knows what brand of canned tomatoes goes in your chili. Liquor is a
bit trickier.
In most areas, a single distributor is available for specific brands of liquor. So,
if for example, you want to carry Bacardi rum, you must buy it from one par-
ticular company. It’s a little trickier to negotiate great deals, especially if you
have to keep certain brands in your bar because the company has a monop-
oly on a particular brand. You may not be able to say, “Forget it. I’m going to
buy Ronrico Rum instead,” if your customers really want Bacardi.
Setting up supplier relationships
Whenever possible, figure out what you need before your sales rep tells you
what you need. Sales reps can be a great source of information, but don’t rely
on them as your only source. Remember, they are in the business of selling
you products. The more you buy, the more money they make.
Here are some tips to keep in mind when working with suppliers:
 Talk to other bar and restaurant owners to see where they buy their
products. For the most part, this business is made up of people willing
to help each other out.
 Be aware enough about your business to know whether something is
good or bad for your business. Easier said than done, we know, but it
gets easier with time and experience. You have to be smarter about your
business than the salespeople. Salespeople often get bonuses for selling
certain products over others. Those products may still be great for your
business, so it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Just know what you want
and why you want it, and stick to your guns.
 Invite your sales reps to your bar to see your setup. Show them your
kitchen and its limitations. Go over your menu with them. Show them
your supply list (like the one in Table 14-1, only longer). Talk to them
about your expectations. Show them your delivery area and storerooms
so they get a feel for any logistical challenges.
Get the supplier’s sales rep and her boss into your bar for the meeting, if
at all possible. This step can shave time off the negotiating game. Often,
the real power in negotiating prices doesn’t lie with the sales rep.
Usually her boss (or boss’s boss) has the final say. If they know that
you’re professional and organized, with specific needs and wants, the
whole process goes much smoother and quicker.
238
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Buy quality products, always. Quality products rarely disappoint cus-
tomers. Depending on how you price your drinks, people may not feel
like they’re getting a value, but we recommend that you maintain a high
quality and charge appropriately.
 Shop for the best price. Don’t shop around for the best price on 
individual items from separate suppliers. Instead, contact potential
vendors with the full list of products you want to purchase, like the
list in Table 14-1, and look at the overall best price. Suppliers have
more leverage to give you better pricing when you do a larger volume
of business with them.
If suppliers aren’t interested in getting your business, they aren’t going to
be interested in servicing your business. Make it clear to them that you
want them to understand your business and how you want it to work.
You’re setting up an ongoing relationship, not just buying groceries for
the week.
Request your sales rep’s office, cell, and home phone numbers. Ask for her
boss’s office and cell numbers, too, but make sure that the sales rep is aware
that you’ve asked for the boss’s contact info. That way, she’s not completely
surprised if you call her boss for some reason, and it keeps the pressure on
because she knows that you may call if you have reason.
Keeping the good vibes going
The best sales reps understand their clients’ business and bring them ideas,
new products, and opportunities in the marketplace that can benefit their
business. They must understand your goals, business, costs, and order and
delivery requirements to do their best job for you. Always ask about return
policies and get them in writing. All suppliers will have one before you buy,
and then might conveniently forget it afterwards.
At the end of the initial meeting, send the sales rep on her way with your list
and an understanding of your goals. Give the rep a specific deadline to get
back to you with a price quote. Be upfront and let her know that you’re
requesting quotes from other companies; you can even mention the competi-
tors by name. This step shows the sales rep that you know what you’re doing
and you’re confident in your research. Remind her that the purveyor who can
meet most of your needs will get the majority of your business.
If you develop a good working relationship with your sales reps, they can
personally deliver small quantities of must-have goods when you run out
midshift. You shouldn’t count on this service, however, because it gets
old fast.
239
Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Using purchase orders (POs)
A purchase order, or PO, is a form that the person in charge of purchasing fills
out and leaves for the person who receives the order. The person in your bar
who accepts delivery of the order compares the stock he receives, the pur-
chase order, and the actual invoice that accompanies the delivery, looking for
things that don’t match. That way, if you know that you got the wrong
chicken, you can fix it before someone starts thawing it and marinating it.
A purchase order includes the details of the products you need in your bar.
After you’ve figured out exactly what items and their sizes you need for your
recipes, you definitely want them to arrive in your bar that way. If you’re
buying wine, and you order a particular vintage of wine but receive another,
it makes a difference in quality, price, and the value to your customers.
Maybe you order 5 pounds of salami, but instead you get 50 pounds; it may
spoil before you can use it. If you want 5-ounce bottles of hot sauce to put on
every table and instead get a case of pint-size bottles, you’ll have to fix the
problem.
You may think these kinds of things don’t happen, but it’s a regular occur-
rence in the food-service industry. The problems get worse when the person
who does the ordering doesn’t do the receiving. A purchase order can help
you minimize the problems, or at least catch them before they become bigger
problems. Check out Figure 14-1 for a sample purchase order.
You can e-mail (or fax) the purchase order to your supplier, and then print a
copy for the receiver. Or you can complete the PO, and then call in your order
to your rep. They may never see the form, but it still helps you communicate
your order accurately. Some suppliers will let you place orders through a
secure Web site and then print a copy of your order for receiving purposes.
It’s an informal purchase order, but it definitely serves the same purpose.
For information about dealing with problems that occur when ordering goes
wrong, check out the next section, “Reordering your supplies.”
Reordering your supplies
These days, most suppliers can give you next-day turnaround on your order.
We recommend that you place orders for delivery of perishable goods, such
as meat and produce, twice a week, once on Tuesday and once on Thursday.
You should be able to order liquor once a week.
240
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Because your business levels increase over the weekend, your Thursday
orders are larger than your Tuesday orders.

Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Require deliveries before 10 a.m. or between 3 and 4 p.m. Refuse deliveries at
any other time because with a bar full of customers, you can’t accurately
check in your order. You’re the buyer; you make the rules.
Only time will prepare you for the quantity of what you need. This is a guess-
ing game until you have experience and are in business for two or three
months. Keep your eye on your inventory. And take a look at Chapter 8,
where we give you our recommendations for the initial order of your most
expensive items, your liquor. This information should get you started until
you can establish how much liquor you actually use.
Using requisition sheets
Only a few people should have the power to spend money on behalf of your
bar. But your bartenders, cooks, and servers will use the actual products
more than you will and may know when you need something before you do.
Use requisitions sheets to give them a written way to communicate ordering
information to you.
Requisition sheets are kind of like POs (purchase orders; see the “Using pur-
chase orders (POs)” section), but they can be less formal. Take a look at
Figure 14-2 for an example. Any form that you use to track requests for sup-
plies can be a requisition sheet. Your bartender can use a copy of the beer
menu to identify needed stock, for example. Whatever system you use, make
sure that it’s a written system, understood by everyone involved. (We recom-
mend that it’s not a collection of sticky notes hanging by the telephone.) A
written system provides an excellent way to communicate requests and start
a paper trail for your supplies. And make sure your employees sign and date
the request, so the purchaser knows how old the request is and who to talk
to if they have questions about the order.
Receiving your products
When a delivery truck pulls up at your back door, check everything in imme-
diately, before the driver leaves your building. Your receiver (the person from
your bar who is checking products in) should have a PO to compare the
invoice (a form that the supplier sends with the goods that lists the items,
quantities, and prices) and products against. The receiver and the delivery
driver both should sign for the shipment.
Use whatever tools are necessary to make sure you get what you intended to
order. (We recommend written tools like purchase orders and requisition
forms.) You can’t assume that the process will work on autopilot. You have to
steer it. More often than not, no one’s trying to cheat anyone out of what they
order. Instead, mistakes are made and are truly accidental. And mistakes
happen on both ends of the telephone. Don’t just assume that your supplier
is at fault. Double-check your documents to confirm that you didn’t order the
wrong stuff.

When trouble occurs, how do you resolve it? Get on the phone ASAP to your
sales rep. Often, she can personally resolve a problem for you, even bringing
you the missing product. If you have the right products, but are charged the
wrong prices, you still want to let her know right away, so she can get your
billing straightened out.
Maintaining Your Bar’s Inventory
Your inventory is the stock of supplies you have on hand at any given time.
It’s an investment, and you get no return on that investment until that prod-
uct sells. It’s truly a balancing act: You want as little money as possible tied
up in inventory, but you want to have enough to efficiently do business.

Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Taking inventory refers to counting your stock to find out how much money
you have invested in it and confirm how much product is actually making its
way to patrons and translating into dollar bills in your pocket.
Inventory is also a warehouse of your cash flow. Excess inventory ties up
money that you can’t use for other necessities until the products sell. Not
managing the balance between cash flow and inventory is the failing of many
a bar. In this competitive business, you want your money where it can work
for you, not tied up in the skid of swizzle sticks you got for half price and that
is now taking up space in the storeroom.
Salespeople love to come up with incentives for you to buy in bulk, but always
examine their offers with a keen eye. For example, they may say, “If you buy
100 cases of tomato juice today, you’ll save $3 a case.” Take a look at that deal.
If you buy 100 cases of tomato juice at $40 per case, you’ve invested $4,000 in
tomato juice. Suppose that it takes you five months to sell this juice, even with
your famous Sunday Bloody Mary Bar. Let’s also assume you have to pay the
$4,000 invoice 15 days from receipt of the goods. In the meantime, at your
margin of 50 percent (which means when you sell a Bloody Mary for $4, $2
goes to cover the cost of the ingredients, one of which is tomato juice), you
have to sell more than 2,000 Bloody Marys to break even on that great deal. All
the while, you “saved” $300. And until you break even, you’re in the red.
Here are a few ideas to keep in mind when a kind-hearted salesperson tries to
lure you into buying more of something than you need:
 Buy quantities that you can realistically use while the item is fresh.
Watch out for deals and large volumes of produce and other perishables.
If you’re throwing out half of what you buy, are you really saving money?
 Balance volume purchases of nonperishable items with the cash flow
you tie up in inventory. It’s great if you’re getting a good deal on three
cases of an expensive, 40-year-old Scotch. But if it takes you four years
to move it, you’ll have lost investment opportunities for that money in
the meantime. Find the balance that works for you.
 Understand that you only bring money in when you sell food and bev-
erages. You have to build all your costs (rent, taxes, insurance, wages,
food costs, and so on) into the prices on your menu. For more on devel-
oping and pricing your menu, check out Chapter 9.
Par levels: Consistently keeping
enough product on hand
Most bars and restaurants resort to the tried-and-true process of manual
counts for inventory purposes. In most cases, food and beverages are counted
on a shift-by-shift basis, using par sheets. Par sheets are lists of items that
244
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

restaurants and bars keep on hand during a shift to help them make food
and drink orders quickly. A par level is the actual number you write on the
par sheet to communicate how much of something your staff should make
ready.
Here are some examples for ways to use par sheets and par levels:
 Set a par level for the number of domestic bottled beers in the reach-in
cooler. (Remember, you will have more bottles in the cold storage
in the back; par sheets help you decide what to keep handy during
a shift.)
 List par levels for garnishes. Bartenders can get these items ready
before their shift begins to ensure they have extra lime wedges or
stuffed olives close by when they need them.
 Decide how much house-made margarita mix you need to have ready
and waiting before your business picks up for the night.
 Estimate how many pizza crusts should be thawed out before your
lunch rush.
A par sheet gives you a place to count what you have on hand, compare it to
what you need to have ready, and communicate to your staff how much to
prepare before the next shift. Take a look at Figure 14-3 for an example of
what a par sheet looks like.
Par levels are a good guide, but they shouldn’t replace thinking entirely.
When ordering and prepping, you must consider the weather, holidays, the
day of the week, and so on, or you run the risk of over- or underprepping.
Keeping par levels and doing shift counts (counting your products before or
after every shift) helps you stay on top of your inventory. Don’t wait until the
end of the month to find out you’re missing supplies.
Taking your bar’s inventory
Knowing how much product you have on hand at any given time is essential
so that you
 Can order product when you get low
 Know where and how your inventory dollars are being used
 Make sure that your inventory is actually making it into your menu items
and out to your paying guests
 Assess the cash value of stock on hand for accounting purposes

Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Everyone seems to have their own way to track inventory. Most bars use one
of these methods (or a combination of several methods). They generally fall
into a couple of categories:
 High-tech systems: These computerized systems include scanner guns
and bar codes and practically update themselves as products come in
and go out of your business. Some systems are fully integrated, tracking
products from the time they’re delivered, through the preparation
process, to the time they make it to the customer. Other systems can
automatically count down your inventory as you use products. If you’re
missing a single can, it shows up. The systems work well if you’re plan-
ning on having an exceptionally stable menu. If you’re planning any kind
of a change, completely automated systems can be more work than
they’re worth. And these systems are more expensive than low-tech
versions.
To use this kind of a system effectively, you have to have someone
who accurately enters all data in a timely manner. This only happens
in a business with sufficient staff to devote the necessary time to this
detailed process. In an independent (rather than a corporately run) bar,
these systems usually end up being scrapped, or underutilized at best.
 Low-tech systems: These rely on paper and people: purchase orders,
requisitions forms, and you or one of your employees physically count-
ing your stock, each shift, each day, each week, and each month.
Even if you use an automated system, you still must physically count your
inventory on a regular basis (monthly, at a minimum, more if you need it) to
account for everything and catch any discrepancies, including simple human
errors and theft. Yes, it’s a big job. Yes, it takes a lot of time. But it’s absolutely
necessary to ensure that your profits are not ending up in a trash can or in
someone’s home pantry.
As part of your monthly P&L (profit and loss statement, which you can read
all about in Chapter 15), you count your inventory. This count is a full and
complete account of all the food and beverage items in your bar. Your goal
here is to reconcile (or match up) your assets on hand (your inventory)
against the liability of the invoices (the bills you must pay).
Take a look at Table 14-2 to see what a snapshot of an inventory worksheet
looks like. We use the same products from Table 14-1 where we decided
which supplies we needed to order.

Here are some general guidelines for taking your monthly inventory count:
 Conduct your inventory late at night or early in the morning. This
way, you minimize the likelihood that you count something twice
because someone moved it while they were working.
 Split up the process over two days. Do dry storage and food one day,
and liquor another. Do not try to do them both on the same day; it’s a lot
of work.
 Enlist the help of several employees. It’s a great lesson to help them
become aware that you have put controls in place.
 Make sure you create and use a complete and consistent format for
your inventory worksheets. Including the unit is essential for getting
an accurate count. The “Unit” column helps everyone know how you
want them to count each product. For example, in Table 14-2, look at
the line for pizza dough balls. If someone went into the freezer and
counted 7 balls of dough and wrote “7” in the “On Hand” column, the
“Value” column would reflect the dollar value for 7 cases of dough (or
$191.38), rather than the value for 7 dough balls, or roughly .3 cases
of dough (or $8.20). That’s a significant difference.
 After you have your count, use a spreadsheet program, like Excel,
to help you calculate the value of your inventory. Multiply the
amount of each item you have on hand by the price you paid for
the item.
248
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Add up the total of all the items in your inventory to get your total
value of inventory. You need this number for your monthly P&L reports
discussed in detail in Chapter 15.
 If at all possible, and to keep people honest, rotate the items that indi-
viduals inventory. In other words, have people inventory things they
are not responsible for. If the bar manager is responsible for the liquor
and the kitchen manager is responsible for the food, have them inven-
tory each others’ area. Otherwise, they may have incentive to fudge the
numbers.
Remember to conduct inventory at the end of a period, like the end of the
week, month, or year. That way you can reconcile all your invoices and state-
ments with the actual physical count to get a true and accurate picture of
your bottom line.
Having too much inventory is as bad as running out. Inventory is money, and
too much money sitting on a shelf is poor planning. Keep records on when you
buy product and when it moves. A good turn on your inventory is 11⁄2 times a
month, which means you go through your entire inventory 11⁄2 times each
month.
Paying Attention to What
Goes On in Your Bar
Being present in your bar is the best way to manage it. It may sound simple,
but when your staff members see you putting in the time, closely watching
what’s going on, they will start to model that behavior. Being aware of what’s
happening can go a long way toward keeping everyone on their toes, which
helps you manage your business the way you want it run.
In this section, we focus on saving you money by managing your business
every minute of every day. We show you ways to reduce money suckers,
such as waste, breakage, and theft, to help you keep more of every dollar.
Reducing waste
Waste costs money, plain and simple. Waste occurs in many places: perish-
able food, utilities, labor, and so on. Spend some time analyzing your opera-
tion. Identify areas where waste occurs.
249
Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Kitchen waste will be the number-one area to check. Almost everything can
be saved in the kitchen (assuming it’s not spoiled). Have a great stockpot for
vegetables, bones, and the like (talk to your chef), and you will have a great
(and inexpensive) base for all your sauces.
Talk about waste with all the kitchen help. Most people don’t intend to waste
and won’t once they know they are throwing away money. Ultimately, if they
do waste money, you will have to close the bar, and they will have to find a
new job. It’s a team thing!
Let everyone know you’re watching for waste and abuse of food, liquor, linen,
and paper products. You can stop the waste and abuse of these items by your
employees, but stopping the customers, that would be another book.
Looking at the most-common wasted items
The easiest way to reduce waste is to be organized and be vigilant. It starts
from the top down. When you’re visible, your employees are less likely to
leave the water running, steal something, forget FIFO (first in, first out or
using the oldest products first). Train your staff to have your eyes for waste.
Financially motivating your employees based on controlling expenses bene-
fits you immediately and forever.
Here are a few key areas to be vigilant about:
 Watch your utility bills. Close the cooler doors and turn off the inside
lights when no one’s working in them. (Are you air conditioning the
neighborhood?) Don’t open windows when you’ve got the AC cranked
and it’s 95 degrees out. Turn off unused burners on your ranges on a
slow night. Turn off lights in vacant storerooms.
 Stay on top of your office supplies. Sticky notes, pens, paper, and
menus add up. Office supplies are the most stolen items in any business.
They’re small, aren’t usually tracked, and everyone can use them. Plus,
many people don’t feel like it’s really stealing if an item or two just hap-
pens to make it home with them in their purse or pocket. Keep them
locked up in the office on a strictly need-to-use basis.
 Ration your linens. Although you want a clean bar, employees can clean
more than a single bar top with a single towel. Remember, every towel
has to go out to the cleaners after it’s dirty, and that’s another expense.
Even if you wash the linens yourself, it’s more work (and water and
detergent and wear and tear) than you need.
250
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Consider rationing your towels. Give each bartender or cook one towel
to last them the whole day. Also, clean up floor spills with dirty linens,
not clean linens. It may seem gross at first, but it’s much more efficient
to clean up half a gallon of ice water with dirty linen, and then sanitize
the floor with a mop, than to do the same exercise with fresh-from-the-
package linen.
 Watch portion and pour sizes. Though unintentional, giving away
an extra half shot in each drink adds up quickly, ultimately subtract-
ing from your bottom line. Dishing up an extra 2 ounces of fries with
each 1-ounce order is like giving away two free orders. Standardized
portions and pour sizes give you a way to monitor use and reduce
waste.
When good food goes bad: Eliminating spoilage
Food products have a much shorter shelf life than liquor, especially those
that fall into the perishable category, such as fresh fruits and vegetables,
dairy products, and meats. Canned foods and frozen foods tend to be more
forgiving of time.
Spoilage in a food-service establishment, like a bar, takes on a whole different
perspective when you consider the volume. If you’ve ever been grumpy
about tossing out a rotten head of lettuce at home, think about tossing out
an entire case in a bar. Ouch!
The good news is that spoilage can be prevented. Begin with an attitude that
spoilage is unacceptable. Keep your staff working on the first in, first out
(FIFO) rule. Train them from Day 1 that they need to use the oldest products
first. Notice we didn’t say spoiled products. No one is advocating that you
serve your patrons rotten food. But you don’t want a carton of sour cream
to continue to get buried behind newer ones and then expire in the cooler
before you can use it.
If you’re ordering in the proper quantities, your staff shouldn’t have too
much extra product to manage.
Believe it or not, beer and wine are perishable. Those little “born on” dates
aren’t just for show. If these products aren’t stored at a consistent, proper
temperature, the perishing process speeds up. If you buy ten cases of wine
and your storage room temperature is fluctuating, you had better be going
through your stock quickly, or the wine’s quality will be affected.
251
Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

Battling breakage
Accidents will happen. But the root of breakage is disorganization. If your
staff is organized and working together, your food is coming out of the
kitchen on time, and your dish area is tidy, you’re much less likely to sustain
breakage than if everything is chaos.
Breakage is an expense that you probably can’t eliminate, but you can take
steps to control it.
 Install magnetic flatware catchers on your trash cans in the dish area.
You’d be amazed at the amount of flatware that gets thrown away in bars
and restaurants. You can also put a sign near the garbage cans: “What
are you throwing away?”
 Only buy glassware with the appropriate washing rack. (Take a look at
more glassware advice in Chapter 7.) Using the wrong racks invites
breakage, especially if the glasses have long stems.
 Organize your dish area so that plates, china, flatware, and so on are
neatly stacked coming in and going out.
 Use rubber mats in the dish area and storerooms where glass items,
from stemware to liquor bottles, are stored. A simple thing can go a long
way in getting more bounce for your buck.
 Hire, train, and communicate with quality employees. Educate them
about your values. Reward them for following the rules you set up.
Assess what hard goods (such as plates, glasses, and the like) you’re buying
on a regular basis. Some items are more delicate and prone to breakage than
you may have originally thought. If the breakage is too much, you may have
to change what you’re serving in.
Another form of breakage amounts to theft. Verifying that a broken bottle of
liquor really was broken is important. Otherwise employees may “drop” bot-
tles right into their lockers. Make sure you save all broken bottles, and know
your suppliers’ return policies. Some will credit your account if you produce
the unopened (albeit broken) top of the bottle. If the seal is intact, you may
be in luck.
Reducing and eliminating theft
Theft means stealing, pure and simple. If a dishwasher pockets silverware from
the restaurant, that’s theft. If a bartender gives a drink away to a customer
252
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

without ringing it up, that’s theft. If a prep cook loads a couple of steaks into a
cooler in his car while he’s stocking the cooler, that’s theft. You can’t possibly
be everywhere at once, so it’s good to have systems in place to help deter the
problem.
Check all your supplies in, lock them up in the correct storeroom, and check
everything out to the correct stations (back of the house, bar, and front of the
house). Keep tight security measures. If you fail to put controls into place,
you will lose good help, and it will be your fault. People are only as honest as
you let them be! Do not give them any temptation. Remember, even churches
are locked.
Using a measuring system (even as simple as a shot glass) can help you get a
consistent pour on your drinks. You can buy systems that mount right on
your bottles, or you can get a computerized liquor control system that works
with your POS (point of sale) system. For more on controlling the amount of
liquor your bartenders pour, see Chapter 12.
Many years ago, Ray learned “There is always one more cocktail in the
bottle.” Pass that mantra along to your bartenders often. Every ounce is
money.
Establish a policy on when the house buys drinks. Some owners buy the first
drink on Friday or offer a special happy-hour rate for regulars. Whatever your
policy is, require all drinks to be rung up on the register. Have a house check
(a check you keep each day to ring up drinks the house buys) because it
keeps everyone honest and slows down the buying of drinks. As staff mem-
bers see the total creeping up for the day, they’re less likely to ask you to add
more to it. Giving a cocktail to a customer for free is like giving away money
from the register.
A great policy is that when the owner buys, you take the money out of your
pocket and pay. This way the customers see you paying with your money,
and your gesture makes them feel that you’re giving them money, not a
cocktail.
Watching out for your staff’s 
sticky fingers
Yes, it’s a sad fact of life. Some people will steal from you. Not all — just a few
dishonest jerks. People are only as honest as you let them be. It’s your job to
keep them honest!
253
Chapter 14: Controlling Expenses and Operating Efficiently

The most important step you can take to prevent theft is to hire smart. (“Hire
smart, fire seldom” is a good hiring policy.) Check out potential employees’
references. You asked for them, now call them. Take a look at Chapter 10 for
more tips on hiring the best employees.
Here are other suggestions to keep your staff from stealing from you:
 Use a ticket system. For every food item and drink, the server must give
a ticket (a piece of paper with the order and the table/check number on
it, also called a dupe in bar lingo) to the employee preparing the order.
Nothing leaves the kitchen or the bar without a dupe or order slip —
nothing!
 Make sure that every customer gets a check, including you. Everyone
sitting at the bar should have a check in front of them. Don’t place the
check behind the bar. Write the customer’s name on the back of the
check. And if you buy someone a drink, ring it up. Everything has to be
rung on the register, even if you comp it later.
 All employees should leave and enter by the same door, and all coats
and bags should be left in an employee area with a closed door with
a camera installed outside or near the door. The employees must
have a place to keep their purses, valuables, and coats. A dishonest
person will steal from anyone, even her co-workers. If people question
your motives, tell them that you’re stopping people from stealing from
you and them.
 Never let a bartender work with an open register (a register that you
simply push a button to open). The register should open only to close
out a sale. Everything has to be rung on the register. If you use an open
register for some reason, watch out for too many “No Sales” on the regis-
ter tape. A “No Sale” is a sign that the bartender opened the register
drawer without ringing something in. The register should only be
opened to settle a bill. Install a change maker to keep the bartender
from having to make change from the register.
 Don’t let a bartender count the money at night. Instead, have him
bring it to the office with a time of closing, the dupes, and any slips
documenting any money taken out and with the specific reason it was
done. (For example, if the bartender has ten $100 bills in the drawer in
the middle of a shift, you may decide to pull that money out and move
it to the safe in the back for safe keeping. If you do that, you need to
replace the money with a note saying who’s taking the money and why.
Only a select few people should ever have reason or authorization to
do this.)
254
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Keep a daily diary behind the bar. It should list the time your bar
opened, the time it closed, and any other facts that are important for
each shift. Managers and supervisors complete the log, and should keep
log entries factual and professional. This tool will be extremely valuable
when you have to reconstruct events for any reason. These documents
can be subpoenaed and read in court, so make sure they accurately rep-
resent your business.
 Watch or have your manager watch employees leaving at night. You
don’t have to pat them down or make them declare their 3 ounces of liq-
uids, but make sure they are not leaving with the store.
 Do not place tip cups next to the register. Have a big tip cup, placed
behind the bar, at least 6 feet from the register.
 Put locks on doors. This suggestion sounds simple, but if you want to
keep people out of something, lock it up. You can lock up coolers, store-
rooms, offices, bar wells, liquor cabinets, and just about anything else.
Locks don’t keep out thieves, but they keep honest people honest. If you
don’t give people the opportunity to steal, most people won’t. If people
want to steal, they’ll figure out a way, but locks are your first line of
defense.
 Give keys to as few people as possible. The fewer people with keys, the
easier it will be to find out what’s going wrong. And in this case, keys are
a deterrent to the few people who do have keys — they know that it’s
usually not hard to figure out what happened.

Keeping Your Bar’s Bottom Line
from Hitting Bottom
In This Chapter
 Checking out forms to keep your business in line
 Setting up payroll parameters
 Keeping your information safe
I
n lots of ways, running a bar is like running any other business. You have
inventory to manage, employees to manage, taxes to pay, invoices to pay,
and customers to keep happy. Many people mistakenly focus on one (or
maybe a couple) of these details at a time. So they miss many opportunities
to dig a little deeper and investigate whether or not they’re making money,
and they spend even less time figuring out why. Without keeping control of
the money and products, you will be out of business fast. (Heather’s dad is a
successful accountant and entrepreneur. His mantra is, “Watch the nickels
and dimes and the dollars take care of themselves.”)
In this chapter, we help you apply standard accounting practices to your bar.
We get you started with understanding some bar- and restaurant-specific
forms that help you analyze your prices, costs, and inventory. We give you
the details about setting up your payroll systems. And finally, we help you
keep all your information safe.
Keep up with your business on a shift-by-shift, daily, weekly, and monthly
basis. Don’t let the details sneak up and surprise you after it’s too late. Don’t
miss the opportunity to make corrections. Use the worksheets, reports, logs,
and other tools in this chapter and throughout the book to keep up with your
numbers and the real dollars they represent.
Reading Your Income Statement
An income statement (sometimes called a profit and loss statement or P&L for
short) summarizes your expenses and sales for the month. Then it allows you

to compare these two figures and determine your bottom-line profit (or loss)
for the month. Take a look at Figure 5-5 in Chapter 5 to see what an income
statement looks like. You must look at this report to see whether your bar is
profitable. If the income statement doesn’t match your expectations, check
your math; errors do happen. But if the actual numbers are correct but not
what you need them to be, start looking for the causes.
Here are just a few examples of what symptoms an ailing income statement
might have with ideas on how to investigate further:
 If your cost of goods sold (COGS; see “Creating a cost of goods sold
(COGS) report” later in this chapter) is a higher percentage than you
had hoped, look at your past invoices to make sure you haven’t over-
paid for the goods you received.
 If your beverage costs are high, investigate waste and theft.
 If your sales are low, go back to your daily business review to see
whether you can isolate which days and shifts were below normal and
start piecing together the problems to find a solution.
 If your marketing expenses are high, evaluate whether sales are increas-
ing at the rate you hoped they would. If not, figure out why.
 If repair costs are high during a period, consider looking at leasing
newer equipment without maintenance fees.
Some establishments create (or run) income statements and other financial
reports to span different periods of time, like quarterly or annually. Feel free
to add these to your must-have financial documents list, but make sure
you’re staying on top of your business on a short-term basis, too.
Deciphering Your Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is a financial tool that compares your assets (like your inven-
tory, furniture, and bank accounts) to your liabilities (your debt, including
invoices you owe). See a sample balance sheet in Chapter 5.
Ultimately, a balance sheet gives you a snapshot of where your business
stands at a specific point in time. Potential investors and creditors look
at these reports to assess your financial health. Watching these reports
over time can help you understand how your business is growing. Keep
an eye on this tool every month, even though it’s the least dynamic report
you run.

Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

We strongly recommend getting an accountant, preferably one with a bar or
food-service background, to help you create and analyze these financial
forms. He can help you with the ins and outs of accounting (like the scary
words depreciation and accruals) that are beyond the scope of this book. And
take a look at Accounting For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by John A. Tracy (Wiley)
to get familiar with accounting terms and practices.
Analyzing Reports in the Bar Business
Your business levels and sales will change from day to day and shift to shift.
Getting the most-current information available is essential to help you adjust
your purchasing plans, preparation schedules, and even staffing schedules.
(For example, if you have an extremely busy lunch that lasts well beyond the
normal for your 1:30 p.m. drop-off, you might consider calling in an extra staff
member or two to help you restock your depleted supplies.) Because this
business is extremely fast paced, you need reports that keep up with you.
This section gets you started.
We strongly recommend doing as much of this reporting as possible using a
computer. It saves a ton of time and tends to be more accurate than old-
school arithmetic by hand.
Using a daily business review
Your daily business review is a report that you create by recording relevant
details (like your sales figures, labor costs, and customer counts) every day.
By recording this info in one place, every day, you build a history of your
business that allows you to compare figures across previous days, months,
and years to establish patterns and determine whether you’ve gained or lost
ground in individual categories.
You can find a sample daily business review in Figure 15-1, but you should
develop your own review that tracks data in the categories important to your
particular establishment. In our sample, we include a line item (like “Sales”)
then add a row just below it [Sales (L/Y)] so you can quickly compare your
current sales to those from the previous year.
Among other things, a daily business review can help you
 Determine whether a current promotional event is affecting your sales.
 Confirm whether your overall volume is increasing over time.

Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Identify whether you have a problem somewhere in your business. For
example, if your sales numbers continue to rise, but your profits aren’t
keeping pace, you have a starting place to begin an investigation.
Because this document, in and of itself, is simply a summary of what
happened on a given day, you’ll likely need to delve into other docu-
ments and operational practices to find the root of any problems.
 Clue into trends in your business levels. The trends, in turn, can help
you make more-accurate buying decisions and set your par levels (or
how much stock you should could keep on hand). For more information
on setting par levels and keeping your inventory under control, check
out Chapter 8.
 Keep your cash flow in check. Many people track their cash deposits
and credit card receipt totals on this form so they know how much is
coming in and when.
Controlling cash flow
Your cash flow is simply the movement of money into and out of your bar.
Money flows into the bar when patrons buy drinks. Money flows out of the
bar when you pay the electric bill. If you think keeping your checkbook bal-
anced is a challenge, consider how tough it is when you don’t know what
your paycheck (in this case, your sales) is going to be and when it might find
its way to you.
Figure 15-2 shows how cash flow fluctuates over the course of a month. We
had to make some assumptions about your business to put this example into
motion, so here’s what we assumed:
❑You started the month with no money in your account.
❑You’re working on a 30-day month.
❑Your sales are constant at $2,500 each day.
❑Your rent is $2,000 each month, paid on the 15th.
❑Your operating expenses (like food costs, labor, and so on) are 88 per-
cent of your sales.
❑You pay half of your bills weekly (on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th) and
the other half on the last day of the month (the 30th). We include payroll
in the bill category here.
❑Half of your diners pay in cash, while the others pay with credit cards.
❑Your credit card companies charge you 3 percent of the total transaction
for the privilege of taking their cards. They deposit the remaining funds
into your bank account with a three-day lag time.
❑You deposit your cash every day.
261
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Bar’s Bottom Line from Hitting Bottom

After all is said and done, you end the month with a little cash left over and
you didn’t run out along the way. Nicely done! But when you realize how little
you had on a few days of the month, you can see that depositing your cash
regularly (at least a couple times a week) is essential. And think about how
delays in transmitting your credit card charges, and spending extra money
when you buy something in bulk, and on and on, can affect your cash flow.
Lots to watch out for!
Creating a cost of goods sold
(COGS) report
A cost of goods sold (COGS) report measures your actual food and beverage
cost percentages, rather than an estimate. (See Chapter 9 for more on pricing
your drinks and meals.) It helps you figure out how much of your food (in
dollars) turns into actual sales (in dollars). It shows you how much you’re
spending on inventory items compared to your sales, which is the ultimate
test of how well you manage your inventory.
Write COGS, but say “cost of goods sold.” No one really says “COGS.”
Take a look at Table 15-1 for a sample COGS report.

To create your own COGS report, follow these steps:
1. Figure out your beginning inventory (A).
If you’re just starting and had nothing on the shelf at the beginning of
the month, your beginning inventory is $0. If you’ve been in business,
just use your ending inventory number from the previous month’s
report.
You can break down your inventory categories in as much detail as you
want. The more detailed you are, the better you’ll be able to spot trends
within larger categories (so you could split beer into multiple categories
like Draft and Bottled, or even further like Bottled–Domestic,
Bottled–Import, Bottled–Microbrew). Just make sure that you track both
your inventory and purchases in a consistent manner so you can get
accurate numbers.
2. Tally your invoices for the products you purchased during the time
period you’re reporting on (B).
Help yourself by keeping an invoice log (list of invoices). Assign each
invoice to a category that matches with a category on your COGS report.
If you make this a habit, you’ll save yourself a ton of time when you go to
create the report. And you’ll make sure you don’t miss any invoices.
If several items from different categories are listed on a single invoice,
make sure you put the correct amount in each category, rather than just
assigning the total invoice amount to a single category.
3. Figure out your ending inventory (C).
For this report to be truly accurate, you must do a full and accurate
physical count of your inventory, and determine the full dollar value it
represents. We give you the details for completing a physical count of
goods in your bar in Chapter 14.
263
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Bar’s Bottom Line from Hitting Bottom

4. Figure out your sales for the inventory period (D).
Your computer system should track this total for you regularly. If not,
add up your daily sales totals from each day during the inventory period
to get this total.
5. Add your beginning inventory and your purchases (A+B). Then sub-
tract your ending inventory (now A+B–C).
6. Divide that total by your sales (D), so [(A+B–C) ÷ D] to get your cost of
goods sold.
Your POS system (computerized sales system) may have much of this report-
ing built in. If it doesn’t, you can purchase spreadsheets and forms from sev-
eral sources, like RestaurantForms.net (www.restaurantforms.net). They
sell individual forms and packages of forms in a range of prices.
RestaurantOwner.com gives lots of tools free to members; you can find more
information at www.restaurantowner.com.
Setting Up Your Payroll System
You will lose good people if you don’t keep your word by paying them on
time, every time. Setting up a payroll system helps keep you happy — you
don’t have to hire new employees — and your staff happy — they get paid,
which is why they’re spending time in your bar in the first place. Heather
managed an independent restaurant for an owner who was constantly
moving money back and forth between his accounts. Her paycheck bounced
two times in a row, and she found another job.
The first rule of payroll (there is no fight club!) is to open two separate bank
accounts:
 Operating account: Your operating account is your main account.
Money from things like credit card transactions and cash deposits go
into this account. You pay all of your bills and invoices from this
account.
 Payroll account: This bank account is only for payroll purposes. Period.
End of story. You move money from your operating account to your pay-
roll account by payday. Never move money from your payroll account to
your operating account. As far as you’re concerned, the money in your
payroll account is no longer your money. If, after payday, an employee
chooses to hold his check rather than cash it immediately, so be it.
Resist the urge to borrow from this account, even temporarily, no matter
how tight money may seem.
264
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Determining your payroll period
There’s really no right or wrong way to pay your people, unless you’re incon-
sistent. Remember, this bar is not only your baby; it’s your employees’ liveli-
hood. It’s how they support their families, make car payments, and pay for
school. Set up a system and stick to it.
Most bars pay weekly or every other week. (Some choose twice a month, usu-
ally the 1st and 15th, but this schedule can make calculating pay for hourly
employees really tough.) Here’s the rundown on the advantages and disad-
vantages to you, the bar owner, for both periods.
 Weekly: The upside is that you have a steadier payout of payroll
expenses. Each week you transfer roughly the same amount of money to
your payroll account. On the downside, you double your management
time. Under this system, you have to verify hours, pay rates, and so on,
four or five times a month, rather than two or three times.
 Every other week: The upside is that you spend less time managing pay-
roll. You can probably cut your payroll costs in half (assuming you’re
farming it out) because you need the service less often. The downside is
that you have a much larger payroll expense every other week.
Doing payroll yourself or outsourcing it
Depending on the size of your operation, you may opt to do all the payroll
duties yourself from start to finish (or assign it to someone in your opera-
tion), or you can outsource some of the work to a payroll company.
Here are the basic steps involved in completing the payroll process:
1. Calculate and verify the hours each of your employees worked.
No matter what kind of system you use, you or one of your other man-
agers needs to look at this information and confirm it before paychecks
are issued. If you use a computerized system to track hours worked, you
can print a report that gives you the recorded hours worked. If not, col-
lect those timecards and start adding.
By verifying the hours, we don’t mean that you need to interrogate every
employee (“Did you work 38 hours or 37 hours last week?”). Instead, you
just scan over the information looking for discrepancies, especially
unexpected overtime.
265
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Bar’s Bottom Line from Hitting Bottom

2. Confirm employee pay rates.
Data entry errors are common, so again someone needs to double-check
this important piece of info even if (or especially if) your time clock is
computerized.
After you do this a few times, it becomes second nature. If you notice that
your favorite dishwasher worked 32 hours this week at a rate of $132 an
hour, you won’t have trouble figuring out that something is amiss.
Starting at this point, a payroll company can take over for you (except
for Step 7, probably) or you can continue the process on your own. This
process does become a bit more tedious at this point because you have
lots of calculations to make.
3. Crunch the numbers.
You have to calculate gross pay and deduct taxes and FICA (better
known as Social Security) for each employee to arrive at the net pay (the
amount owed the employee after all the withholding is withheld).
Employee checks are issued for the net pay amount, but the check
stub should give them details such as their gross pay and itemized
deductions.
As an employer, you send payment for taxes and FICA to the appropriate
government agency on a regular basis. Get with your accountant for the
details.
4. Tally the net pay for all of your employees to determine your total
deposit for the payroll account.
5. Transfer the payroll deposit from the operations account to the pay-
roll account.
Keep both accounts at the same bank so you can make a phone call or
complete an online transaction to move money from one account to
another and post it by the end of the day.
6. Cut checks for each employee.
Print a separate check for each employee. Make sure each check
includes details about the number of hours the employee worked, his or
her gross pay, and any deductions taken out.
7. Distribute checks to employees on payday.
Establish a scheduled time, usually midafternoon, to distribute checks.
Even if you hire a payroll company, you still need someone in house to
double-check the information before checks are handed out. Decide whether
a payroll company’s service (to basically crunch numbers and issue checks)
is worth the amount of money you’ll pay for it.

Keeping and Protecting Your Records
All businesses must keep records for all kinds of things . . . just in case of
audits, court cases, police investigations, and so on. Right now, it may not
seem like such a big deal, but next month, next year, or even five years from
now, how do you know what to keep? Does the IRS really need to see how
much you spent on keg beer six years ago? Yes, it does, believe it or not. Take
a look at Table 15-2. It gives you our recommendations for how long to keep
certain documents.
If you get information from a reputable source that differs from the informa-
tion in this book (like from the IRS, your accountant, or your dentist — no,
scratch that last one), follow the most conservative recommendation to
cover yourself.

Preventing identity theft
Identity theft is regularly in the news today. Basically, crooks steal vital per-
sonal information of unsuspecting people and open credit cards in their
names, using their Social Security numbers, birth dates, last known address,
and so on. They then max out the credit, never pay the bills, and stick the vic-
tims with a huge mess to try to unravel. As a business owner, you have a
responsibility to protect your customers and your employees from unscrupu-
lous, would-be thieves.
Keep a security camera in your coat-check area. Despite the warnings, people
do leave identification in their coats. The IDs can be stolen and used to
commit identity theft.
You’ll have all sorts of paperwork with sensitive information on it — yours,
your employees’, and your customers’. Keep your employees’ Social Security
numbers and other highly personal information locked up in your office, and
store bank account numbers for your business and customer credit card
numbers out of reach. Locks don’t keep criminals and thieves out of your
stuff. But they do keep honest people honest. Ultimately, if someone wants
to get into your file cabinet, they will.
268
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Hackers be gone! Protecting 
your computer system
You will probably store just as much sensitive information on your computer
as you will in the filing cabinet in your office, so you need to protect your
computer from hackers. Hackers are computer-savvy criminals who want to
gain access to your records to either destroy them or use the information for
illegal gain. A firewall is a software application that protects the restaurant
and its clientele from attack from hackers. Talk to the sales rep who sells you
your computer system about the best plan for protecting your system. At a
minimum, limit access to the system to managers and make sure everyone
has their own password so you can track who’s doing what in the system.
Hackers can attack your credit card system as well. Make sure that you’re
using a reputable credit card company. It should have protection, insurance,
and encrypted, or secure, systems. Talk about what services the company
offers, and pick what’s best for your business.

In This Chapter
 Spreading the word about your bar
 Finding new bar customers
 Keeping your customers coming back for more
 Getting started on the right foot
You may pour the best drinks, tell the best jokes, and have the best selec-
tion of games on your 35 TVs, but if your potential customers don’t
know it, you’re not going to make any money. Getting people in the door for
the first time is half the battle. Keeping them coming back requires you to do
an excellent job of entertaining and pleasing them while they’re in your place.
In this chapter, we show you how to spread the word about your new bar and
keep it spreading. We give you concrete ideas for letting people know about
your bar so they can come in to check you out. We have tips for competing
with all the other bars and restaurants that are vying for your customers, and
we give you ideas for keeping your customers coming back again and again.
Generating Word of Mouth
The best form of marketing and advertising is word of mouth, having others
speak about your place. People connect and trust other people who’ve had
a good experience. Hearing good comments about your bar from another
person makes a potential patron much more likely to stop in than if they
had read your ad in the newspaper. In fact, ultimately you want your main
advertising to be word of mouth. But you can’t have it until you start it. So

get going! This section shows you how. For more great information, take a
look at Advertising For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Gary Dahl (Wiley). It has
a whole chapter on word-of-mouth advertising.
Above all, give your customers excellent service and products. No one com-
plains about them, and no one complains about the price if the food and ser-
vice are great.
Making sure everyone knows
your name (and logo)
Name recognition goes a long way, just ask the politicians. All public relations
(PR) is good PR (unless the health department is involved, of course). So get
your name out there in front of people.
Ray has a friend who puts his bar’s name on everything in his place, from the
front door to the line where you sign your credit card. You can have your
bar’s name printed on just about anything — you make the choice.
Choose a great name and hire a professional to create a great logo. For more
on choosing the right name, take a look at Chapter 6.
We recommend putting your name and logo on these items to spread the word:
 Local newspaper: Run a small ad, but run it often. Ask that it be placed
in the entertainment section so people see it when they’re planning their
evenings.
 T-shirts: You can sell T-shirts for a small profit and have walking bill-
boards all over town.
Remember, T-shirts have space on the back. Use it.
 Pens and pencils: Everyone uses them, so give patrons one of yours
with your phone number, Web site, or tagline on it.
 Business cards: Carry them and hand them out. Put a free drink coupon
on the back.
Consider printing business cards for bartenders and longtime staff mem-
bers, too. They can pass them out to their mechanic, dental hygienist, or
other people they come into contact with.
 Bumper stickers: People put stickers on everything, not just cars.
College kids use them to decorate dorms, fraternities, notebooks, beer
fridges, and backpacks.
272
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Frisbees and other toys: Frisbees are a great choice if your community
has large, open parks or campuses where people play ultimate Frisbee
or use them as dog toys. Patrons may take other silly toys and set them
on their desk at home or work. If a particular gimmick fits your demo-
graphic, put your name on it and give it away.
Whipping up a Web site
Web sites are a must-have item for any business these days. A Web site can
tell people on the other side of town or on the other side of the world about
your place. Its reach is limitless. Your Web site doesn’t have to be full of the
latest dropdowns, rollovers, superslick graphics, or Flash videos. And it
doesn’t have to be expensive.
Register your Web site address as soon as you choose a name for the bar.
Make sure you make it simple and closely related to the name of your bar.
For example, if your bar’s name is Muldoon’s, www.muldoons.com is a natu-
ral choice. Unfortunately, it’s already the home of Muldoon’s Menswear,
so you’ll have to pick another one. Keep the address reasonable, like www.
muldoonsbar.com or www.muldoonspub.com and so on. (Incidentally,
both of these are taken as well, so if you’re going to open up a bar called
Muldoon’s, you’re going to have a challenge on your hands when it comes to
choosing a Web-site address.) Skip the crazy punctuation or weird spelling
(unless the name of your bar is truly unique, Muldoonz, for example).
You can register your address, get design help, and launch a Web site quickly
with a company like Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com),
Yahoo! (http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/services), or NetFirms
(www.netfirms.com).
Here are the basics for your bar Web site:
 Your address and phone number. Most people look up bars online to
order drinks for delivery — no! — to find out the location. If you’re really
thinking, include a map and directions from different areas of town.
 Your hours of operation.
 Your menu.
 Your calendar of events.
 Your drink specials.
 An opportunity for patrons to sign up for newsletters, mailings, or Web
site updates.
273
Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd

If you have merchandise like sweatshirts, T-shirts, and gift certificates that
you sell in the bar, consider making them available for sale. A shopping-cart
feature is a little more complicated and expensive, so if you don’t want to
start out with one, it’s okay. You can always add one later.
You only need to update the Web site when you have changes to the menu,
entertainment, or specials. It won’t be a huge time commitment, but you can
reap the benefits.
Getting your employees excited
about your place
You want your staff to want to come to work. You want them to encourage
other people to come to the bar. You want great synergy between the front of
the house (FOH) and the back of the house (BOH). Treat your staff with
respect and insist that they treat each other with respect.
Take their ideas to heart. Encourage them to develop new drinks, menu
items, or merchandising plans, as the ideas are appropriate in their position.
Making employees feel like they have a say gives them a greater sense of
ownership and pride in your business. Employees are often the driving force
behind community involvement efforts (see the next section, “Making the
most of community involvement”).
Having daily meetings before opening to explain new menus and hear any
suggestions from the employees is very important. Respecting and listening
to your employees sets an example that they’ll follow with your customers.
To show your employees that you appreciate them, have an employee of the
week or month, and give them something small to go along with the honor.
Your staff can be your most loyal supporters or your quickest road to ruin.
Make sure they’re advocating for you, building your bar up in the eyes of
your patrons, and representing the bar the way they should.
Making the most of community 
involvement
Community involvement means being a caring and contributing member of
your community. Maybe you give money to charity, host charity events at
your bar or, donate gift certificates for silent auctions. Being involved in your
community makes people feel like you’re a member of their world, like you’re
all in it together, and they’re more likely to make yours a regular stop when
they’re bar hopping.

Sponsoring amateur sports teams in your town is a no-brainer for a bar.
When you’re approached by a coed softball team (and you will be, trust us),
say yes if you can swing it financially. You’ll reap the benefits by getting your
name and logo on the uniforms and by, likely, getting the team and their fans
in after their games.
Stay away from sponsoring teams with players under 21 years old. You don’t
want to be seen corrupting tomorrow’s leaders. Most kids’ leagues have regu-
lations against it anyway, so this likely won’t be a problem.
Here are some other ideas that may be less obvious to the bar newbie but
can get your bar’s name in the public eye:
 Host charity events. A local bar in Heather’s neighborhood sponsors the
Red Ribbon Ride to support AIDS research every year. The bar is on the
ride’s route and hosts the party afterward, too.
 Sponsor runners or walkers in charity events.
 Give a check to local hospitals and VA hospitals for charity drives.
 Help with school or church magazine drives.
 Search out food-rescue programs that repurpose restaurant food for
homeless shelters.
 Sponsor a team at your local chili cook-off, wing-apalooza, or other food
competition.
 At Christmas, give a bag full of toys and games to Toys for Tots (www.
toysfortots.org).
 Have a fun float for any and all parades (think St. Patrick’s Day, Veterans
Day, and so on).
You must limit yourself when it comes to community involvement because
every nonprofit organization in town will visit you. Prioritize which ones are
important to you. Three of the most important for your business are police,
fire, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). You need them.
Keep all records of any donation for a tax write-off. Talk to your accountant to
get the complete information on what you can and can’t write off.
Also, consider getting involved personally in nonprofit groups that are
important to you, whether it’s neighborhood revitalization efforts, scholar-
ship programs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Habitat for Humanity, or something
else. Being a board member or a volunteer exposes you to more people
who may be interested in your business and impressed by your largesse.
And volunteering definitely makes most of us feel good to genuinely help
others.

Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd

Getting New Customers in the Door
Before your customers can be regulars, they need to be customers. Getting
them in the door is half the battle. And as the line between bars and restau-
rants becomes more blurry (even before you’ve had a drink!), you compete
with new businesses every day for the almighty drinking dollar. This section
helps you help your soon-to-be customers sift through their options and see
your bar for what it is: Their soon-to-be favorite place.
Remember, if you start one of these programs and then take it away, it
reflects negatively on your business. Do it right the first time. You may
not have the opportunity to do it right the second time. Keep an eye on
all promos. When they start to get old and don’t bring any new customers
in, change them! Nothing lasts for ever.
Handling your first customers: 
The grand-opening crowd
Your grand opening is a great opportunity to get lots of buzz going about
your bar. Human curiosity makes people want to try out something new, so
opening your place is likely to bring in a crowd looking for what you have to
offer. Do it right, and that crowd will continue and build over time. Do it
wrong, and that crowd will be the only one you get.
In Chapter 13, we show you everything you need to do to prepare for the
grand opening, but here are some basic tips for building on your opening
crowd:
 Make sure your bar, kitchen, and waitstaff are ready to go.
 Invite business leaders, local celebrities, beautiful people, and anyone
else whom your demographic relates to or aspires to be.
 Consider hiring a PR firm to spread the word about your opening. You
don’t necessarily need to sign a year-long contract with a PR firm, but do
seriously consider the benefit a firm provides for getting you off on the
right foot.
 Create a memorable invitation. Don’t simply print up your invites on
stationery and mail them out. Consider sending them in custom-printed
pint glasses, on a coaster, or with logoed items like silicone bracelets,
stress balls, or bottled water.
276
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 Invite people from the local luxury-car enthusiast club (along with their
luxurious cars). Parking sweet rides right outside your door can set a
very hip tone for your place.
Make sure you keep those customers coming back by running your bar the
right way every day!
Promoting your, uh, promotions
Promotions are special events going on in your bar on a not-so-regular basis.
Specials (see the next section) and promotions are the second-best way of
getting new customers (word of mouth is number one). Typically, promotions
involve some sort of theme or event that goes on for a set period of time — a
night, a week, or a maybe a month.
Here are a few examples of promotions that may be successful in your place:
 “Insert-beverage-brand-here” parties: Your liquor representatives have
special liquors or beer they’re always promoting. They have all the swag
and tchotchkes to go with it: buttons, beads, bumper stickers, and so
on. They may also have a staff of attractive young women to walk
around your bar and hand out all the stuff. Just ask your salesperson
and keep asking.
 Trivia nights: Teams and individuals compete on electronic trivia games
in the bar.
 Karaoke nights: Everyone can sing or thinks they can.
 Open-mike nights: You choose the genre — singing, telling jokes, or
whatever fits your place.
 Speed dating: This one is hot. Speed dating allows single men and
women to meet several potential dates in one evening. Two people talk
one on one for a couple of minutes and then move on to the next person.
Check out 8minute Dating (www.8minutedating.com), PreDating from
Cupid.com (www.pre-dating.com), or HurryDate (www.hurrydate.
com) to host an event in your bar. Most parties take place early in the
evening and on weeknights when your bar may not be packed already.
You also get the benefit of getting mentioned on the dating Web site.
 Bartending contests: Invite all the bartenders in the area. Choose
a theme, like the fastest mixologist, funniest barkeep, or let’s-name-a-
cocktail-after-the-town.
 Déjà vu celebrations: Have a grand reopening or birthday party for
your bar.
277
Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd

 New menu items: Try adding new ethnic dishes or cocktails. The
change, even a temporary one, brings in a different customer.
 Customer contests: Hold a contest to name a new cocktail or dish. Or
sponsor a contest to buy a recipe of the best homemade entree in
the area.
Don’t forget to put your best foot forward during these events because
you will have new (and potentially regular) customers in your place. If
they get great food and service and have a great time, they’re more likely
to come back.
Drink and food specials
People like to get a bargain. Sometimes the lure of the bargain helps them
decide to visit your place rather than someone else’s. Most bars try specials
of some sort until they find something that works for them. In the following
sections, we explain some of the most common specials.
Cheap food and liquor brings people in the door. Period. But you always have
to consider who it’s bringing in and how they’ll behave after they sit down at
your bar and fill up on cheap liquor. If your drinks are too cheap, it can
encourage overconsumption and intoxication, both of which can be a
headache in terms of liability and the PITA (Pain In The Abdomen) factor.
Consider the consequences before you drop your drink prices.
Setting up your happy hour
Happy hours are designed to bring customers into your bar early, let them
relax after traditional working hours (9 a.m.–5 p.m.), and, hopefully, get them
to stick around. Half-price cocktails, special beer prices, and food are the
common fare. Serve appetizer-type foods — items that are small but good
quality. Don’t have tasteless fried food that just fills up chafing dishes; have
items that will make you look great, items that people will talk about. Consult
with your chef — don’t make it just chips and dips.
278
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 
Early-bird specials
These food specials offer reduced-priced items
in the late afternoon to early evening. In most
cases, senior citizens take advantage of them
and don’t stick around. Consider this only if
you’re ready to split one $5 entree in half and
serve it up with two glasses of water.

Have something special food-wise that your patrons can’t get anywhere else.
Work with your food vendors to find unique, easy-to-prepare appetizers that
you can restock easily.
If the food is supposed to be hot, keep it hot. If it’s cold, keep it cold. A bad
happy hour will hurt, not help, your business. If you’re going to do it, do it
great. See Chapter 9 for more about setting up a happy hour.
Offering drink nights
Some bar owners choose to discount certain drinks on certain nights. You
can focus on a special price or a special category of drinks for a special night.
Thursday night seems to be a popular night for these specials, but remember
that you’re competing with other bars looking for the same drinking dollars.
Here are a few successful drink-night ideas:
 $2 pints
 $2 domestic bottled beer
 $3 well drinks
 Martini specials
 Margarita specials
Please, never do all-you-can-drink nights. You won’t make money, and more
importantly you encourage overconsumption and all the legal problems that
go along with it.
Catering to certain groups
Depending on your location, you may want to run early-week or early-evening
specials for certain groups.
Here are a few ideas for doling out special group privileges:
 College night: Discount with a student ID.
 Greek night: Discounts for fraternity and sorority members.
 Ladies night: Ladies get half-priced drinks (and food). Men and women
both come — chicks to get the drinks, dudes to get the chicks. This
promo is good for your really slow night, maybe Tuesdays.
Ladies Nights have been banned in some areas due to gender discrimi-
nation. Some bars get around it by offering the discounts to people
wearing skirts or lipstick.
279
Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd

 Amateur sports teams: Players in uniform after their game get a discount.
 Public servants: Give a nod to police officers, soldiers, firemen, and EMTs.
 Restaurant employees: Consider running late-night specials for these
night owls.
 After the game: Fans can bring in a ticket stub from that day’s game for
a 10 percent discount.
Cater your specials to your area and clientele. This list is only the beginning.
Promoting specific dishes
You can make every day a banquet. If you serve meals in your bar, offer cer-
tain meals only on certain days at a lower-than-average price.
Make Monday Lobster Night; Tuesday All-the-corned-beef-you-can-eat Night;
Wednesday All-the-pasta-you can-eat Night; Thursday Thanksgiving Night with
turkey and all the trimmings; Friday Fish-fry Night. You can do just about any-
thing you want (Mexican or Chinese nights, farmers’ market nights, potluck
nights), but be consistent. Make sure everyone knows what you serve when,
and they’ll pass the word. As always, make these meals great, or you’re wast-
ing your time and money. Most bars don’t run specials on the weekends
because bars are typically busy during those times.
If you’ve got a hook, use it: the best burger in town, the biggest burger, the
only Buffalo burger, the largest pizza. Big, best, and any words that tell your
customers how unique your meals are (in a good way, of course) are the
key words.
Making the most of music
Make your current and potential customers aware of your music and enter-
tainment offerings. Check out Chapter 6 to figure out what kind of entertain-
ment works for your bar and how to get it.
After you’ve decided what entertainment to have, use it as a mechanism to
spread your name around town. When you book hot bands, post fliers around
the local college campus. Consider running ads on the radio station that
plays the same type of music the band plays. Newspapers routinely look for
content in the what’s happening sections and often print entertainment
schedules for free.
Don’t forget to include professional posters in your own place about upcom-
ing bands and entertainment engagements.

Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

Giving Your Customers a 
Reason to Come Back
Getting customers in once is good, but creating repeat customers and even
regulars is essential to keeping your bar afloat. The surest way to keep them
coming back is to give them a quality experience and, to some extent, a value.
That’s not to say you have to be a bargain, but your customers should feel like
they’re getting what they pay for at your place.
To make your bar successful, you have to meet your customers’ needs, and
to meet your customers’ needs, you first have to know who they are. After
you figure that out, you can figure out what they want and decide how you
can give it to them. Try to determine your demographic profile, or the set of
traits or characteristics the group shares.
For demographic data on the people near your particular location, consider
contacting a company like Claritas (www.claritas.com) to do the research
for you. They can help you target your customers more effectively than you
can on your own.
Here’s a list of questions to ask yourself when you’re trying to figure out who
your customers are:
 Are they men, women, or both? Are you looking for singles, couples,
or a mix?
 Do you attract a particular segment of the community, like a college
crowd, the after-work-people-in-suits crowd, or a hard-hat lunch group?
Maybe you get different groups at different times of the day, week, or
month.
 What age are your patrons?
281
Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd
Considering coupons
We don’t like the idea of coupons or buy one, get
one free. It can look like your business isn’t doing
well, and word travels fast (almost always faster
than any positive news coming out of your
place). Coupons seem to carry a stigma (think
cheap, low quality, cheesy) that you probably
don’t want associated with your bar, with one
exception: Drink coupons for one cocktail to get
people into your bar. They work. Offering two-for-
one meals won’t attract the customers you’re
looking for. Trust us!

 What’s the economic level of your customer? Does it match the economic
level of the area your bar’s in?
 What types of cars fill up your parking lot?
 Do you draw in tourists, business travelers, locals, or a mix?
You’re not trying to exclude anyone from your bar. You’re trying to create a
picture of the patrons you want to attract so you can gear your products,
menus, and entertainment options to them.
Ensuring good customer service
All the marketing, advertising, and promotions don’t keep customers. Service
brings customers back again and again. Do something right, and a customer
will tell ten people. Do something wrong, and that customer will tell a
hundred. In fact, we think good customer service is so critical to your success
that we include a whole chapter on the subject, Chapter 11.
Service doesn’t begin or end with the person who’s handing your patrons
their drinks. You as the manager or owner can go a long way toward provid-
ing excellent service. Talk to your customers and make sure they’re having a
great time. Approach a table or patron with open-ended questions like “What
can I do for you tonight?” or “How is everything?” rather than “Is everything
all right?” (Is “all right” or “okay” your goal? We doubt it.)
Figuring out what your customers want
After you know who your customers are, you have to figure out what they
want. (We call this the psychographic profile.) You can do this by determining
the answers to a set of very simple questions:
 What do they drink? Do you sell tons of draft beer and hardly any wine?
Do your martinis fly off the bar while your sidecar special sits around?
 What food do they order?
 Where do they eat and drink when they’re not visiting your bar?
 How often do they visit you?
 What do they enjoy doing besides sitting in your bar?
 What do they eat elsewhere that they can’t get at your place?
“Great questions, but how do you get the answers?” you ask. Talk to your
patrons. Get to know them. And consider creating a comment/suggestion card.
282
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

You don’t have to change a single thing based on their answers to your ques-
tions. It’s your bar, for crying out loud! But knowing the answers can help you
make better choices when you’re ready to make changes. If 50 more people
would come in daily for lunch if you only had a nice 8-inch pizza, wouldn’t
you want to know that?
Start a database of customers and include information such as birthdays,
anniversaries, and other special occasions. Place comment cards with table
tents and give customers an incentive (like a complimentary appetizer or
drink) to join the mailing list.
Turning complaints into repeat customers
Although no one likes to hear what they’re doing wrong, many bar owners
overlook the immense opportunity that customers provide when they’re
chewing you out because your place sucks. Granted, it doesn’t always feel
like an opportunity at the time, which is why we’re telling you about it now,
in a moment of cool, calm collectedness. You do, indeed, want people to
complain to you on occasion. The alternative is that a customer is disap-
pointed, doesn’t tell you, never comes back again, and tells 15 other people
how bad your place is. Yikes!
Okay, so here’s how you make sure they not only leave happy but also come
back and stay happy.
1. Listen to the patron.
Close your mouth, make solid, continuous eye contact, and just listen.
Too many times managers rush to fix the problem without listening to
what the customer is telling them. In essence, the manager interrupts
them, causing even more problems.
Remove whatever is disappointing or offending the customer immedi-
ately. If it’s a drink or food item, remove the glass or plate immediately
after you’ve heard their complaint. If it sits there in front of them, it
continues to be a source of negative emotions and can prevent you
from turning around the situation.
2. Apologize or thank them for the feedback, depending on the situation.
Believe it or not, many patrons just want to know that you hear their
problem and feel their pain. Your sincerity can go a long way in resolving
the problem in their mind. Sometimes guests just want to tell you an
idea that would make your place better for them, so it’s not a complaint,
it’s just a suggestion. Thank them for their interest in your business and
let them know you’ll consider their idea.
283
Chapter 16: Building and Keeping Your Bar Crowd

3. Fix the current problem.
Don’t just start comping drinks off their check. If the problem is that
their glass is chipped, get them a new one. If the Coke in their Jack and
Coke tastes funny, go check the soda system. Give them a quality experi-
ence first, and consider giving something away as a last resort.
4. Rectify the long-term problem.
Let them know that you’ll definitely take care of the long-term problem.
In the chipped-glass example, maybe you institute a more-careful inspec-
tion of glassware at some stage in your stocking process. In the Coke
example, you can set up a system where a barback makes more frequent
checks of the soda system. Whatever it is, figure out what systematically
let the offending experience occur and take steps to fix it.
Making patrons feel special
When customers feel like your bar is their home away from home, you know
you’re treating them right. One bar owner Heather knows maintains a photo
album of regular guests, including details about them like their favorite
drinks, significant other, kids, alma maters, and profession. He quizzes his
employees during staff meetings about the details of each Very Important
Patron. Almost everyone feels a special connection to the bar because the
staff members can call them by name after just a few times. Talk about creat-
ing repeat business.
284
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 
Who needs a reason to party?
We all do, to some extent. Whether the refrain is
“It’s 5 o’clock somewhere!” or “Paycheck
Friday,” many people can have a better time
when they celebrate something. Personally, we
celebrate only on days that end in y, but we’re
sticklers for that kind of thing.
Here’s a list of good reasons to throw a party at
your place:
Back to school
School’s out
Graduation
Oktoberfest
Spring Break
Homecoming
Racing events (IndyCar, Formula One, NASCAR)
NBA Finals
Stanley Cup Playoffs

staff for feedback on what changes to make to better serve your patrons.
Maybe they regularly request a brand of vodka that you’re not pouring. They
may let you know that your restrooms need more attention on weekend
nights than they’re currently getting. Or if every third chicken sandwich is
sent back to the kitchen, you can find the problem. Check out “Maintaining
Your Success” later in this chapter for help in analyzing your market and
staying on top of the competition.
When you make changes, make them slowly — every other week, for exam-
ple. For many people, gradual change is better. You can give people a chance
to get used to new menu items and drink offerings without too much stress.
Strike a balance between keeping your regulars happy and bringing in fresh
meat — we mean, new customers. Your regulars became regulars for a
reason. You don’t want to unwittingly do away with the reason.
Maintaining Your Success
So you’re open. Now what? Maybe you have a feel for what works in your bar,
a process to keep it moving and shaking. If you don’t, you’ve come to the
right place. Most of the work of keeping your profits pointed in the right
direction involves staying on top of what other people are doing and doing
it better.
Researching your competition
Know thy enemy is true in any business, and the bar business is no excep-
tion. Conduct regular reviews of your competitors, and know what they’re
doing right and how they’re missing the boat.
Here are some questions to help you when you’re shopping your competition:
 What’s on the menu?
 How much does it cost?
 What’s it taste like?
 How’s the quality?
 What draft beers are they pouring?
286
Part IV: Managing Your Inventory, Revenue, and Future 

 What’s their pricing structure for beer, wine, cocktails, and so on?
 What bottle beers do they stock?
 What’s featured on their drink menu?
 What glassware are they using?
 What specials are they plugging?
 What entertainment are they advertising?
 What kinds of customers do they draw?
 How are their bathrooms?
 How’s the general atmosphere?
 What’s their draw?
 What do they do that’s special or intriguing?
 How does their location affect them?
 How was the service?
If you’re looking at a specific part of your competitor’s business, make sure to
include it in your list. Maybe you don’t care what their bathroom is like and
only want feedback on the chicken wings. Develop your own list of questions
that get you answers to your concerns.
It may go without saying (too bad, we’re saying it anyway), but when you
shop (or have someone else shop) your competition, do it very stealthily.
Don’t sit at the bar asking questions and filling out your little form unless, of
course, you approach the bar owner and ask for permission to do so. Instead,
you typically get your questions in mind and then experience the bar like any
other patron. Yes, like any incredibly observant and curious patron.
Staying marketplace savvy
Knowing what’s going on in the bar industry is essential for you to succeed.
Stay in the know with trade publications and organizations. Join your local
chapter of the National Restaurant Association (www.restaurant.org) or
your state affiliate of the American Beverage Licensees (www.ablusa.org).
Talk to real estate agents in the area; they know the changing scene. And
don’t forget the Chamber of Commerce. Folks there may be in the know
about long-term plans for different areas in your community.

Subscribe to trade publications such as BARTENDER magazine (www.
bartender.com) to keep up with trends throughout the field. (Yes, a
cheap plug — Ray’s the founder — but a good magazine.)
The most important advice we can give you is to listen to your customers.
Talk to them every chance you get. Get feedback from your servers and

 Slips on a spill.
 Can’t find the emergency exit.
Help keep your patrons and employees safe with the pointers in this chapter.
Hiring Safely
Be very cautious when hiring. Make sure applicants provide references and
check them. Call all previous employers and ask about their experiences with
your potential employee. You don’t want to find out after you’ve hired some-
one that he or she has a criminal record or a history of violent or deviant
behavior. Make sure you make the workplace safe for all your employees.
Don’t hire someone if you have the least bit of doubt.
It’s your responsibility to maintain a safe environment for everyone who
works for you, and that means protecting your staff from people who may
want to harm them, including other employees. Take a look at Chapter 10 for
more help on hiring employees.
Practicing Fire Safety
Call the fire department first if a fire starts. Then try and extinguish it with a
fire extinguisher. Keep extinguishers near the kitchen, grills, and behind the

bar, and make sure all employees know how to use them. You can buy extin-
guishers from companies that inspect them on a regular basis to make sure
they’ll work properly when needed. Contact your local fire department to
find out what fire codes apply to your bar and for tips on fire safety.
You need to have lighted exit signs at all doors that lead out of your bar.
Make sure the signs can remain lighted during a power outage. (The same
company that maintains your fire extinguishers can help you with emergency
lighting.) Keep all doors unlocked during business hours, and make sure the
doors are never blocked. Have fire drills at least every other month, and
instruct employees on how to get customers and staff members out quickly
and safely.
Using Video Cameras
Video cameras deter criminal behavior, including theft and violent crime from
everyone! These days, you don’t pay too much to have video cameras
installed at your bar. Post signs notifying the public that you have the cam-
eras. Have one camera at the front door and one at the back. They pay off ten
times plus in the long run. Check with your insurance company because you
may get a discount on your premiums if you install video cameras. And check
with the local police — they may want you to have them too. Make sure you
change the tapes regularly and keep them up-to-date.
Tell your employees that the cameras are for their own protection and that
you’re not spying on them. Ultimately, it’s your decision where to put the
cameras, but never infringe on your employees’ privacy!
Using Locks and Alarms
All your supply rooms should be locked, and only managers should have
access to the keys. Remember, locks keep honest people honest. Keep these
storerooms locked at all times unless someone is actually stocking.
Your liquor and supplies cost you lots of money and have the potential to
make you even more money. Keep them locked up!
Make sure employees have lockers with locks. What does this have to do
with safety? It stops everyone’s temptation to steal. Stealing an employee’s
keys can lead to much more than stealing their car. It can lead to breaking
into their house or worse. Keep everyone safe, not sorry!
All your exit doors need alarms so you know who’s leaving and when they’re
leaving. You don’t necessarily need them on interior doors, but they can’t hurt.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Most alarm companies install systems for a very low fee and charge you a
monthly maintenance.
Consult with both your police and fire departments on alarm systems and
which ones they recommend. Sometimes they charge for false alarms; ask
them!
Preventing Slips and Falls
Keep floors clean, and use only slip-proof cleaning and waxing supplies. When
a spill occurs, make sure someone stays near the spill, or put chairs over it to
keep people from walking into the spill. Clean up any spills immediately and
place a Caution Wet Floor sign in the area until you’re sure the floor’s dry.
Place rubber mats where possible behind the bar and in the kitchen for
better traction. Rubber mats give you the added benefit of cushioning the
floor, making it easier on employees’ feet. All stairways need rubber treads
and handrails. Ask your local fire and building inspectors for guidance. They
can work with you.
Taking proactive steps can help you keep insurance premiums down and min-
imize any legal problems.
Installing Lighting
To ensure safe working conditions, have lighting at all doors and parking
areas. Install emergency lighting in all rooms, including the kitchen. Always
have backup lighting, which can include flashlights and power lights. If you
have the money and space, consider buying an emergency generator, which
can also maintain your refrigeration system. If the lights go out, you’ll be the
only one with COLD BEER! The generator will pay for itself! Working grids
(lights installed in the floor on the floor) are also very helpful. In case of a
blackout, your customers can find their way out.
Checking IDs
Train all front-of-the-house employees how to check IDs. The legal drinking
age in every state in the United States is 21 years old. Check carefully. Look
for the expiration date, the word duplicate, and any smudges. Use a flashlight
or magnifying glass to make sure the ID is authentic. If you’re not sure, don’t
serve.
293
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Run a Safe Bar

In some communities, no one under 21 is allowed to even enter the premises.
Make sure you know which laws and regulations apply to your business.
You can get an ID-checking guide from your beer wholesaler, or contact the
Driver License Guide Company, 1492 Oddstad Drive, Redwood City, CA 94063;
phone 800-227-8827; Web site www.driverslicenseguide.com.
Serving Hot Food
People want their coffee, tea, and food hot. Train your employees to be very
careful when serving hot food. The rule for serving is to serve on the right,
pick up on the left. Your servers need to use extreme care when carrying hot
food to the table and always tell the guest, “This plate’s hot,” or “The soup’s
hot.” Keep serving areas free of clutter, and remind your employees to work
slowly and safely with hot food. It burns!
Keeping a First-Aid Kit
Make sure employees carry a band-aid in their wallet or purse. Keep first-aid
kits behind the bar, in the kitchen and coatroom, and next to the fire extin-
guisher. Post phone numbers for the ambulance, police, and fire depart-
ments. Post instructions for performing the Heimlich maneuver in the locker
room and kitchen. Hold first-aid and Heimlich training every two months. It’s
worth it. You can also find a service company to stock and maintain your
first-aid kit.
Following Handicapped and
Discrimination Laws
Your bar must be handicapped accessible; that includes the restrooms,
entrances, and exits. Make sure you post all state and local ordinances and
discrimination bulletins where your employees can read them.

Ten Myths about Running a Bar
In This Chapter
 Looking at some common misconceptions in the bar business
 Preparing yourself for the reality of running your own place
You probably came to this business expecting it to be fun. Well, you’re
right. It can be a ton of fun when you run your business well. But you
may have some other ideas that aren’t as realistic. This chapter helps you
compare your expectations against reality to make sure you know what
you’re getting into.
The Hours and Days Are Short
The hours and days are long, but time does pass quickly when you’re having
fun. Busy days go by fast. Slow days last twice as long. Be prepared for long
hours.
You’re not only the owner; you’re also the employee when someone doesn’t
show up. Hint: Open your tavern six days a week instead of seven when you
first start your business. This way you can give everyone, including yourself,
a break. It’s also a good idea to have two shifts. Overworked people don’t
perform at their best capabilities. Careful scheduling and good managers
make your life easier. Hire well; fire seldom.
Free Drinks All Day, Every Day
Your job is to serve, not drink. Don’t make the mistake of sitting around par-
tying with your friends while the business goes on around you. This job is an
investment designed to make money. Work hard in your bar. Play hard at
other places. Every cocktail is money, so don’t drink your profits.

Don’t confuse being friendly with your staff and being friends with your staff.
If you’re hanging out in the bar with your staff, you’re in the danger zone.
Ultimately, if you’re drinking in your place of business, you’re taking a risk. At
some point you’ll embarrass yourself or someone will take advantage of you,
most likely by stealing from you in some way.
There’s Not Too Much Paperwork
As a bar owner, you take care of lots of details, and many of those details
require — you guessed it — paperwork! Your life can be overrun by paper-
work: invoices, statements, income-tax forms, state forms, alcohol beverage
control forms, and employment forms. And that’s just for starters! Have an
experienced accountant help you with the bills and taxes to eliminate 50 per-
cent of the paperwork you have to handle. Then you can spend your time
with the other paperwork: scheduling forms, monthly promotions calendar,
inventory forms, checkbook, order forms, payroll, and other stuff. You’re not
finished until the paperwork is done.
Your Family Will Want to Work for You
If you’re very lucky, your family will help you, and it’ll be a pleasant experience
for everyone. But always remember that people will disagree (with you or each
other), and someone has to be the owner. Have a job description for every
position (whether or not family members fill those jobs) so no one’s feelings
get hurt. Take a look at Chapter 10 for more job-description information.
If you do decide to work with your family, explicitly go over your expecta-
tions with them, especially your rules about handling cash and inventory.
When you mix money with family, relatives can become accustomed to unin-
tended perks, including helping themselves to loans, a bottle of scotch, or
free draft beers. Make sure they understand what’s acceptable and what isn’t.
You Can Hire Good Help in a Snap
Help means just that: Help! Good, experienced help is hard to find and harder
to keep. As the saying goes, if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. If your
place is busy and everyone makes money, everyone will be happy. But you’ll
have bumps in the road — slow days, bad weather. Be prepared!
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Showing respect to your employees is the most important step in keeping
good help. Don’t correct anyone in front of customers or other employees.
Treat them fairly, always. Good employees are hard to find. And remember,
you’re only as good as those who work for you!
You Know Everything about Everything
Every owner and bartender at one time or another is asked to settle an
argument. Don’t be the expert; let the facts speak for themselves. Keep a
sports almanac, the latest copy of the Guinness World Records, plus a general
cinema and movie trivia guide behind the bar. Let these references solve the
arguments. If you have a computer, go to your favorite Internet search engine
to get the facts. No one can argue with the facts.
Do not get into arguments with customers. Some people are always right, or
think they are. Worst-case scenario: Agree to disagree. You don’t want to lose
customers over a trivial discussion over who was the MVP in the 1977 Major
League Baseball All-Star game or who won the 1962 Academy Award for Best
Achievement in Sound Editing.
Nobody Would Steal from You
Know your inventories. Watch them daily, monthly, whatever you need to
stay on top of your business. Take a look at Part IV for all the details on keep-
ing adequate tabs on your numbers. Check out more strategies for curbing
sticky-finger syndrome in Chapter 14.
Here are a few specific rules to help you keep honest people honest:
 Ensure that all cocktails are rung up immediately.
 Use a computer-generated ticket that includes the table and check
number for all food and cocktails.
 Keep staff coats, purses, and other personal belongings in a safe place —
away from the door.
 Have your managers and bar staff keep a diary or communication log.
Include the opening and closing times, who tended bar, and which wait-
staff members were on duty. Immediately write down any problems and
the solution. Keep good records; don’t rely on your memory.
297
Chapter 18: Ten Myths about Running a Bar

Everyone Is Trustworthy
Set up effective cash-handling procedures and consistently follow them.
Establish your policy for complimentary drinks and stick to it. If you’ve
established a firm policy, it’s tougher for employees not to follow it. Take
a look at Chapter 11 for establishing procedures.
We strongly recommend that bartenders send the cash drawers to the closing
managers rather than count the drawers themselves. At a minimum, the bar-
tender counts the drawer and the closing manager recounts and verifies it.
This may seem unnecessary, but double-check all your orders. Check in every-
thing before signing the delivery invoices. Double-check your copies against
any mailed statements and pricing agreements to make sure you’re charged
only for what you receive at the agreed-upon price. Verify everything, every-
thing. Keep everyone honest!
Everyone Loves the Boss
No one likes the boss! Respects, admires, fears — yes, it’s possible. If you
treat people with respect, you’ll be respected. But it’s nearly impossible to
successfully run a bar or tavern and be liked by everyone. You’re running a
business, not running for governor. Write down the rules and regulations and
explain them the day you hire someone. Establish a consistent orientation
process and go through it with employees on their first day. Ask them to read
the rules and sign off on them the same day. You’ll have fewer mistakes.
Anyone Can Run a Bar or Tavern
The bar business captivates and intrigues people. People think it’s glamorous
and exciting. Customers see you working where they play and assume that it’s
always a party. It can be a party, and it can be fun. But to be successful, you
must maintain firm control, consistent procedures, and vigilance. Running
a bar or tavern is definitely not easy. But hard work, a great attitude, and
determination do pay off!

Chapter 19
Ten Bar Owner Sins
Not to Make, Ever
In This Chapter
 Recognizing errors that can spell disaster for your business
 Setting up the ground rules before you begin your venture
M
any first-time bar owners can’t see the long-term problems that come
from seemingly minor or insignificant decisions. By thinking about
some ground rules and making decisions before sticky situations arise, you
can avoid the consequences of making the wrong decision. Here are our tips
for avoiding some of the biggest problems in the business.
Depending on Your Friends and Family
You have to attract and retain customers. Don’t depend on your family,
friends, or relatives. They probably will patronize your place, but they’ll
expect to get freebies and deep discounts. Your customers will become like
family and friends, only they will pay you for what they eat and drink. For tips
on building up your bar business and attracting and keeping customers,
check out Chapter 16.
You have to pay your suppliers, not supply your family and friends.
Extending Lines of Credit to Customers
“In God we trust. All others pay.” After someone starts a long-term bar tab, it’s
too easy to say, “Put it on my tab.” It will get out of hand. Make it a house policy
to not start bar tabs, and put in an ATM so customers have quick access to
cash. Do not chase your own money! Credit cards are easy to come by these
days if a customer really needs a loan, so let real lenders take the risk.

Starting a nightly tab, with a credit card to secure it, is convenient for both
you and the customer. You don’t have to do the cash-out dance every time
someone orders a drink, but make sure you settle up at the end of every
night. With a credit card to secure the tab, you’re practically guaranteed that
your customer isn’t going to “accidentally” leave without settling up.
Some customers (we call them customers, after they walk in the door) will
run a tab at your place, and then say they can’t pay, but will go down the
street and pay cash! Please trust us on this one.
Allowing Gambling or Betting
Without a license that is. . . . In most areas, allowing gambling without the
proper paperwork is against the law, and you will lose your liquor license. A
patron who loses too much cash will turn you in to the authorities, and you
will be out of business. Do not let anyone in your establishment take bets,
make bets, or be in any way involved in gambling. Period.
Not Taking the Keys from
an Intoxicated Patron
Be safe and you will never be sorry. If a customer who has had too much to
drink gets in an accident, he or she will sue you. You will be a part of a law-
suit. Take the customer’s keys and call a cab to take the customer home.
Always be safe, not sorry.
Train your staff how to recognize when a patron has had enough to drink so
they can make these serious decisions. Take a look at Chapter 11 for training
tips and for help in dealing with difficult customers.
Believing the Customer Needs
“Just One More”
If you are concerned about the rate someone is drinking, slow them down!
One more becomes two more becomes three more. Watch your customers;
you want them to come back. Bartender training is very important, and so is
waitperson training. Monitoring how much customers have had to drink is a
team effort. Everyone should watch and help each other. Remember, you
want that customer back, so you want them to leave happy and sober.
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Lending Money to Anyone
You’re not a bank — you’re a bar. Like extending credit, the likelihood that
you’ll see that loaned money again is pretty low. “Neither a lender nor bor-
rower be” is excellent advice. That $10 becomes $20, then $30, and then
goodbye friendship, money, and, most importantly, customer!
Becoming Romantically Involved
with an Employee
It’s not love. It’s lust, the liquor, or just being stupid. Don’t play where you get
paid. It’s dangerous. Everyone who works for you will know that you’re seeing
an employee after hours; there are no secrets in the bar business. Be careful;
be smart. Workplace romance causes serious tension for everyone, including
the people not in the relationship. The staff’s attitudes toward you and your
paramour will change because everyone will think you’re treating that person
better, and that will cause turmoil in your business. Ask any owner!
Drinking and Working
Combine these two and you have the absolute worst cocktail. First of all, you
have to be sober when counting and handling money (assuming you want to
make sure you get every dime you’re due). Second, you are dealing with cus-
tomers and employees. No one can drink and handle either one. Your job is
to supervise, not sip and serve.
You’re the innkeeper, not gin sleeper. It’s not a good idea to get into the habit
of drinking at your bar with customers and employees.
Drinking and Working (Did We Say
This Twice?)
Drinking at work: NO! Did we repeat ourselves?
301
Chapter 19: Ten Bar Owner Sins Not to Make, Ever

Last Call Is Last Call. The End. No More!
Give last call (the magic moment when you take final drink orders for the
night) at least 20 minutes before closing. When it’s 5 minutes before closing,
all drinks must be off the tables and the bar. This step must be done as a
team. Last call is last call — it’s not first call before last call — it’s last call.
To make enforcing last call easier, allow only one drink per person, not two
or three drinks per person. This rule is very important and should never
be broken. If you make one single exception, you’ll have a losing battle on
your hands.
Have the bartenders come out from behind the bar after last call. That way,
no one can make another cocktail!

Bar Jokes You Can Tell
Your Customers
In This Chapter
 Revisiting some classics
 Adding some one-liners to your joke repertoire
B
ars are havens for jokes and jokesters. Some of those jokes, of course,
aren’t suitable for printing in this type of book. But we’ve put together a
collection that you can tell to just about any customer, anywhere, anytime.
Bounce This!
A big man approached the bartender and said, “I see by the sign in your
window that you’re looking for a bouncer. Has the job been filled yet?” “Not
yet,” the bartender replied. “Do you have experience?” “No,” the man admitted,
“but watch this!” He walked over to a loudmouthed man at the back of the
room, lifted him off his feet, and threw him out into the street. Then he turned
to the bartender and said, “How’s that?” “Great!” said the bartender. “But you’ll
have to ask the boss about the job.” “Fine,” said the man. “Where is he?” “Just
coming back in the front door.”
Generous to a Fault
A man walks into the tavern, sits at the bar, and says to the bartender, “Give
everyone a drink and have one yourself!” The bartender complies. A little
later the man says, “Bartender, give everyone a drink and have one yourself!”

Again, the bartender complies. Now the bartender presents the man with a
check for $30, and the man says that he has no money. This infuriates the
bartender, who immediately comes from behind the bar and bodily throws
the man out. About an hour later, the man comes back into the bar and says
to the bartender, “Give everyone a drink but leave yourself out. You get nasty
when you drink!”
Sign of the Times
Three deaf-mutes walk into a tavern and sit down at a table. The bartender
greets them and takes their order using sign language. After returning to the
bar, he is complimented by a patron on his knowledge of sign language just to
better serve his patrons. After a few rounds of drinks, the bartender notices
the three deaf-mutes’ hands moving a mile a minute. He quickly grabs a bat
from under the bar and chases the deaf-mutes out. When he returns, the
same patron who complimented him earlier questions why he ran the three
out of the bar. He replies, “If I told them once, I told them a thousand times,
no singing in this joint!”
If You Haven’t Got Your Health . . .
Doctor: “The best thing for you to do is to give up drinking and smoking. Get
up early every morning and go to bed early every night.”
Patient: “What’s the second best thing to do?”
When Do You Open?
The owner of a corner saloon was sleeping peacefully at 3 o’clock in the
morning when his phone rang: “What time does your saloon open?” asked a
voice. “Eleven o’clock,” said the saloonkeeper and slammed down the phone.
A minute later the bell rang again. The same voice asked, “What time did you
say your saloon opened?” “Eleven o’clock, darn it,” roared the proprietor,
“and you can’t get in a minute before.” “Who wants to get in?” said a very
hurt voice. “I want to get out!”

Which Are You?
When intoxicated, a Frenchman wants to dance; a German, to sing; a Spaniard,
to gamble; an Englishman, to boast; an Italian, to eat; an Irishman, to fight; and
an American, to make a speech.
Your Wife’s Not Looking for You
A bartender tapped a drinker on the arm and apologized. “Excuse me, mister,
but if you’re the pale-faced runt who looks like a lop-eared rabbit, I’m to tell
you your wife got tired of waiting and drove the car home without you.”
Nurse or Bartender?
What’s the difference between a nurse and a bartender? A bartender gives
you a shot in a glass.
Bartender (bärtndr)
BARTENDER:
1. An irrigation engineer.
2. The only psychiatrist who works in an apron.
3. A good mixer in more ways than one.
4. A person who brings you in contact with the spirit world.
5. A person to whom almost everything is a stirring event.
6. One who knows that the emptiest men in the world are those who
are full.
A Horse
A horse walks into a bar, and the bartender says, “Why the long face?”

A Duck
A duck walks into a bar and says, “I’ll take a shot of bourbon and put it on
my bill.”
A Pony
A pony walks into a bar and says, “Bartender, may I have a drink?”
The bartender says, “Speak up, I can’t hear you.”
The pony says again, “Bartender, may I have a drink?”
The bartender replies, “Look, if you don’t speak up, I won’t serve you.”
The pony replies, “I’m awfully sorry, I’m just a little hoarse.”
A Snake
A snake walks into a bar, and the bartender says, “I’m sorry, but I can’t
serve you.”
“Why not?” the snake asks.
“Because you can’t hold your liquor.”
A Giraffe
A man and giraffe walk into a bar and start drinking. The giraffe passes out,
and the man gets up to leave.
The barman says, “You can’t leave that lying there.”
The man says, “It’s not a lion, it’s a giraffe.”

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Famous Quasimodo Bar Joke
Quasimodo has retired. The priest holds interviews and auditions to fill the
vacancy, to which a man with no arms shows up. The priest asks how he
intends to ring the bell. The man replies, “With my face.” The skeptical priest
laughs, the man backs up, runs full tilt at the bell, and smacks it with the
bridge of his nose. “That’s all well and good,” replies the priest, “but my con-
gregation is spread out over 10 miles. I’ve got to have volume.” The man asks
for a second chance, backs up farther, runs hell bent for leather, and careens
into the bell, which gives a high, resonant bong. Unfortunately, the man rico-
chets off the left side and falls off the parapet to his death. The priest runs
downstairs to the crowd surrounding the body.
People ask him, “Father, do you know who this is?”
“Well, I don’t know his name, but his face rings a bell.”
Part two:
Three days later, a second man with no arms shows up for the same job. The
priest refuses the man admittance, saying he doesn’t want to go through that
again. “What do you mean, again?” the man asks.
“Three days ago another no-arm guy showed . . .”
“That’s my brother! I’ve been following him for years! How’s he doing?” The
priest tells him how his brother had unfortunately passed away, whereupon
the man urges the priest to hire him so he can spend the rest of his life work-
ing where his brother had passed away.
“I’ve corrected the fault he had on his approach to the bell,” he says, “so just
let me work here for my brother.” The priest hesitates, so the man backs up
and hurls himself into the bell, which gives a resplendent bong. But the man
falls off the parapet to the courtyard below. The priest rushes downstairs.
Startled onlookers ask, “Do you know this one, Father?”
“No, but he’s a dead ringer for his brother.”
307

Part three:
After the second armless man falls off the tower, the priest places another
ad in the paper, and a third armless man shows up, the third brother. Once
again, the priest explains the rigors of the job and impresses on the man that
the “gong” has to be heard all over the city. The man answers that he can do
it and is given a tryout. He goes back as far as he can, speeds toward the
great bell at an alarming rate, misses the bell completely, goes off the tower,
and smashes to the street below.
The priest jumps down the spiral staircase, and when asked by the crowd if
he knows the man, states, “No, I don’t know his name, and his face doesn’t
ring a bell with me.”
