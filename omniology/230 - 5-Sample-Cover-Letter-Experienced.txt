Dear Mr. Russell, 
 
Please accept the attached resume for the position of System Administrator as recently 
advertised on indeed.com. I've had the pleasure to review the companyâ€™s website and went over 
the job description, and am very enthusiastic about the position. I believe that my combination 
of technical skills, experience and business sensibilities would serve Vandelay industries well in 
this position. 
 
Attached resume includes all the details about my career and education background but here is 
a quick summary about myself that will highlight how I can be the perfect match: 
At my current position as a Help desk technician I build, manage and troubleshoot hundreds of 
servers.  I provide first/second level support to thousands of internal or external customers.  My 
professional experience includes diagnosing and addressing complex hardware and software 
issues.  Also I maintain the highest level of system security and educate users on the latest 
system updates and technologies.  I have saved millions to my company by introducing XYZ. 
 
I am very much interested in speaking with you to discuss the value I can bring to Vandelay 
industries.  I can be reached at the above telephone number or email address. I look forward to 
hearing from you. 
 
 
 
With best regards, 
Imran Afzal
