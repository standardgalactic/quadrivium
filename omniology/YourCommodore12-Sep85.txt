HAVE YOU EVER HAD A HANKERING TO
be the computer generation's Leonardo
Da Vinci? Have you ever wondered if your
Commodore could be the instrument
which will lead to the achievement of
great heights of art and design? There is a
whole world of artistic creation hidden
away i n  your computer and it's just
waiting to be let out. Think of all the
marvellous programs you could enhance
when y our artistic talents have been
unleashed upon the world.
You may think that this is just a ﬂight of
fantasy on our part. Maybe we're hoping
that our readers are the best thing since
sliced bread (which you are, of course!).
However, now's your chance to realise all
that potential talent by taking a look at our
special graphics features this month.
First on the list is a special review
section on graphics software packages.
You can get expert opinion on how good
each one is and how much use it will be to
help y o u  ac hiev e y o u r  partic ular
ambitions on the graphics front. It's also
packed with lots  o f  really important
information lik e prices and names of
manufacturers to make it all easier for you
to get hold of. Not to be missed.
Graphics hardware is also dealt with in
detail this month. We look at four items of
hardware - two lightpens, a touch pad and
an electronic mouse ( no, that's n o t
something to keep your cat happy on a
rainy day!) Even if you don't want to buy
any of these particular items then you'll
ﬁnd it interesting to know the facts about
them for future reference.
Last, but by no means least, is our
graphics program for the C64 which you
can type in to get your own personal
sketch pad for no extra charge. So if the
prices of all these other items have scared
you to death then never fear because
we're still looking after you and your
pockets.
The sporting life
This is also an issue for those lazy armchair
sports people who have never managed
to get outside and pick up a racket of any
description and the only things they ever
run for  are number 15 buses. We've
brought together a collection of sports
games currently available and had a really
good lo o k  a t  them. There's tennis,
snooker, •squash, baseball, soccer and
ﬁshing so if we haven't catered for your
particular taste then it's not for want of
trying.
There's now a very wide choice of this
type of sports simulation on the market
and we've realised that armchair addicts
need someone to take the strain out of
making a decision, so once again we've
rallied round and done what's expected
of us. Eric the energetic reviewer was
positively whacked by the time he'd been
through them all, but we feel that it's
done him a lot of good as his hands are
now very slim and supple which is more
than can be said for the rest of him.
So, just sit down in a quiet corner and
have a read of the fruit of his great efforts.
There's certainly something to be said for
an energetic game of footer in your own
home on a drizzly English summer day.
For those who are more interested in
the ever popular sport o f  golf, then
there's something for you too. We've
managed to put together a competition
with a sporting theme and we've got hold
of 50 copies of APS's Nick Faido's Open to
give away. There's absolutely no end to
our efforts to get you all ﬁt and pander to
your whims. So if you don't like baseball
and t h e  excess o f  tennis  i n  t h e
Wimbledon fortnight is still giving you
nightmares then turn to our competition
and you could ﬁnd yourself having to
choose between a wedge and a driver and
wondering what on earth par is anyway!
And that's not all, of course, we've got
all our regular features and lots of series to
keep you at your keyboard for the whole
month till we come at you in October with
all your old favourites and some new stuff
as well.

Top of the League
ANOTHER FOOTBALL GAME HAS Ap-
peared, but this one, rather than being an
all action arcade game, is  actually a
computer moderated board game.
'Bryan Robson's Super League' is a
game for upto eight players, that puts you
in the position of a football club manager.
Along with the computer cassette, dice,
money, a n d  'other  accessories' ar e
included, a n d  Br y an Robs on has
apparently said 'This is the best football
board game I have played' (though he
doesn't say how many of these games he

years old, and to join in the celebrations
of this great occasion, Argus Press
Software plan to release 'Rupert and the
Toymaker's Party' on the Quicksilva label,
for both 64 and Spectrum.
It seems that old Rupert has been left
behind on the way to the party. To get to
the party Rupert has to follow a trail of
invitations leading t hrough t h e
Toymaker's castle.
With excellent cartoonlike graphics,
it's 'challenging, addictive and jolly good

ALL AMERICAN ADVENTURES LTD HAVE
just launched 'Exodus-Ultima III' upon
the British public. Described as an 'epic
fantasy role-play ing experience' i t
certainly sounds lik e  t h e  closest a
computer game has  y e t  c ome t o
duplicating t he game Dungeons and
Dragons.
Before starting the game, you must
equip a party of four players determining
their s ex , s tr ength, intelligenc e,
profession and so on, just as in D&D.
Once all this has been done, your players
then enter the world of Sosaria, where
you must track down your enemies and
defeat them.
If the press release is anything logo by,
then it sounds like a very complex and
challenging game. Available for the '64
from 20th June, Ultima II retails at f19.95
(disc), and further details are available
from: All American Adventures, Unit 10,
Parkway Industrial Centre, Heneage St,
Birmingham.

EVESHAM MICRO CENTRE HAVE PRO-
duces what sounds like an excellent value
cartridge in the Quickdisc+. Designed to
speed up the '64's 1541 disc drive, the
Quickdisc+ costs only  £19.95, muc h
cheaper than many similar cartridges,and
offers the following facilities: Fast save
and load (4 to 5 times faster than usual),
Fast format (10 seconds), Fast ﬁle copy and
disc format as well as other features.
At f19.95. it sounds like very good
value, and further details can be obtained
from Evesham Micro Centre. Bridge St,
Evesham, Worcester.
FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF
CBS from the software scene, Epyx, their
software subsidiary, have signed on with
U.S. Gold, who will market the Epyx titles
under their own label from July of this
year.
Epyx titles include the past and present
bestsellers, Temple o f  Apshai, and
Impossible Mission, and planned releases
for the next year include Summer Games
II, Winter Games and F.B.I.
The people at U.S. Gold are describing
Summer Games II as 'the greatest sports
simulation product ever produced'. And
Geoff Brown, MD of U.S. Gold, claims
that the major share of the U.S. market
that Epyx currently enjoy will assure an
unparalleled success in the U.K.'

The long awaited Elite at last
makes an appearance on the
C64
FOR THOSE OF YOU NEW TO COM-
outing (if you've been around awhile, you
must have been a hermit not to have
heard it), Elite has been the most talked
about game since Space InvAders. Now, at
last, it is ﬁnally outside the domain of the
BBC micro owners for whom the game
was ﬁrst written.
Basically, you are meant to be a trader,
buying and selling goods to the planets
within the galaxy. As you gain credits, it is
possible t o jump t o  the other seven
galaxies within the Elite universe (though
you won't have to worry about this for
your ﬁrst few weeks). Your aim is to gain
credits by trading goods and also blasting
pirate ships. As you do so, it becomes
possible to increase the facilities of your
ship. The cost of add-ons varies from 30
credits fora new missile, up to 6000 credits
for a military laser. The availability of any
given item is dependent on the 'tech
level' of the particular planet you are
docket at.
One of the ﬁrst things you notice with
the Elite packaging is the high quality
maintained throughout. This isn't your
average game w it h  t h e  instructions
G a m e  O f  T h e  M o n t
Front V i e w
printed on the sleeve of the cassette case.
This box contains plenty to keep you
amused for hours, and that's before you
even load the game. Before you read the
instruction manual (called t he 'space
traders ﬂight  t r aining manual')  I
recommend that you read 'The dark
wheel' a mini (48 pages) novel by Robert
Holdstock which is also included in the
pack. It's quite good and should get you in
the right frame of mind for the game.
The training manual, like the rest of
the pack is a high quality document and is
even longer than the mini novel at 64
pages. T her e a r e  v er y  f e w  ac tual
instructions in the manual. It deals more
with the many aspects of being a space
trader. There are eight chapters covering
navigation and ﬂying, interplanetary
travel, combat, intergalactic trading, a
political proﬁle of the universe, and a
guide to the other types of ship you may
encounter on your travels. Screen and
keyboard shots are used throughout to
aid clarity. Other items of documentation
include, a mini ship identiﬁcation poster,
a quick guide to the keys that control your
ship (53 keys are used in all in 6 different
modes), and the last thing to come out of
the box before the cassette is a cardboard
keyboard overlay showing some of the
more important commands.
If you have the cassette version of the
game, it takes quite a while to load, but
don't fear, it's well worth waiting for. The
LU
•
LU
screen display is split into two sections,
the main view outside the cockpit (either
right, left, front or  back, whichever is
selected). The other section of the screen
shows the internal cockpit indicators.
There are twelve of these in all, the largest
being a 30 short range scanner. Also on
view; front and aft shield strength, cabin
and laser temperature, altitude, number
of missiles remaining, compass, speed
indicator, roll and climb status, and the
amount of energy remaining in the four
energy banks.
All transactions take place in  the
spinning space stations above the planets.
It is here you start and this is the only place
where you can save the game. For those of
you who have never seen the game on the
BBC, I am not going to give any hints as to
how you can amass lots of credits quickly.
Needless to say, it is important to gain
conﬁdence of ﬂying and combat, as this is
the way to achieve Elite status. There are
many small things along the way that will
help towards your goal, some that simply
prevent you being destroyed. Keep your
eyes peeled on to the various magazines,
and I'm sure that you'll pick up all sorts of
bits and pieces.
From the brief description of the game
that I've given here, you will realise that
there is  a high degree of  complexity
involved. Don't let this put you off, if you
miss out on Elite, you miss out on one of
the best computer games ever written.

IN THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT REPORT
from Her Majesty's Inspectors on the
ability or otherwise of our children to
tackle mathematics competently it is
worth looking at the range of material
available for the Commodore 64.
It has been suggested that more use
should be made of calculators in the
classroom. This is all very well as long as
the user has the  basic ability t o
understand the numbers being used and
be able to spot any errors made. This all
leads back to early learning and a good •
grounding in basic number skills. With
good foundations i n  the concepts
involved more advanced skills should slip
easily into place.
There are computer programs to cover
all levels of mathematical skills from pre-
school through to '0' level revision and
even a package aimed at the adult market
dealing with mathematics in a business
context. However, just because there are
plenty of programs it does not mean that
they are all good. As with the material
available for the teaching of reading great
care must be taken before purchasing a
program and all considerations, as to what
is to be taught, examined.
As with the teaching of reading even
the youngest child can be caught using
the computer as a medium. One of the
ﬁrst skills to be learnt is the relationship
between a number of objects and the
numeric ﬁgure. There are several games
on the  market dealing with this.
Commodore market an A.S.K. package
called 'Let's Count'. This is a two cassette
box containing four games. The ﬁrst game
Treasure island has the child matching
equal quantities of shield on pirate ships
to treasure chests on islands. The second
game moves on to matching objects in a
space station to numbers. Space Hopper
deals with the difﬁcult concept of more,
less or the same by asking the child to
decide whether there are more red
packages or brown before they are
loaded onto the space ship. The ﬁnal
game in the package gives the child
practise in getting the numbers in their
right order: a correct answer gains a
reward in the shape of Mr Muscles ringing
bells.
Each of the games is well thought out,
has beautiful graphics and effective use of
sound.
Mirrorsoft have a package with similar
aims to Let's Count. 'Count with Oliver' is
a double sided cassette. On one side
Oliver, a delightful cartoon character.
fanletettrt.,,
learns how to count in a toyshop. He also
teaches the user the ﬁgure that ﬁts the
number. On the reverse Oliver learns
simple addition and subtraction in a
sweetshop. This consists of Oliver buying
sweets, adding more and then eating —
subtracting — some.
One o f  the  best early learning
programs I have seen recently is marketed
by Fisher Price, a ﬁrm with a good name in
the toy world. Their 'Up and Add' Em' is a
cartridge based program which aims to
teach number, ﬁgure relationships and
simple addition. I t  does this using
bunnies, ducks and penguins ﬂoating on
strings of balloons to create a rainbow.
This program is so appealing and easy to
use that my four year old sits and plays by
himself — he is learning too.
Further programs dealing with this
part of learning numbers are Mr T's
Number Games in which the child counts
spots as they jump on and off a ladybird
and Toddler Tutor — Channel 8 software
— which has a section on counting toys.
Of course, as with reading, all the
concepts and skills learnt with the
programs discussed are the Sort of thing
that most others automatically teach their
children in the course of a normal day. We
count eyes, shoes, milk bottles on the
draining board, in fact anything that
comes to hand. We teach through hands
on experience so why bother using the
computer? Well, as every mother knows,
there is more to a day's housework than
counting biscuits and it is handy to be able
to sit a four year old down for a little time
with a game which has been developed by
a team of educationalists and computer
experts. I am not advocating leaving your
child with the computer for hours on end
- you must take an active role in his
education - but the Commodore 64 has
the power in its graphics and sound
capabilities t o captivate him  a nd
hopefully he will get that basic foundation
from which he will be able to build real
understanding of mathematics.

Eric Doyle has worn himself
out looking over some of the
sports simulations that are
available for the Commdore
64.
LAST SATURDAY I  PLAYED A  FEW
frames o f  snooker followed by  three
tennis matches, a game of squash, two
games of baseball, a game of soccer and
then went ﬁshing and after lunch... OK,
I'm not Superman but with such a range of
computer sport simulations available I can
dream, can't I?
The range o f  sports programs is
daunting and the recent growth in this
area o f  computer games has many
puzzling aspects. For example, baseball
had never proved popular in this country
until the release of imagine's World Series
Baseball game which shot to Number 2 in
the Charts.
As athlete's foot gives way to joystick
linger the time is right for a sporting guide
to the 64.
Tennis
Tennis was probably the ﬁrst sport to be
simulated as a  computer game some
ﬁfteen to twenty years ago. By modern
standards these arcade machines were
crude bat and ball games which would
probably be turned down as a reader's
contribution t o  our  listings pages. It's
amazing how standards change.
Match Point by Psion was an excellent
game on the Spectrum but the conversion
for the 64 failed to impress.
The problem with the game is one
which i s  c ommon w i t h  ma n y  3 D
simulations and stems from the difﬁculty
of estimating the ball's position in space.
With Match Point such spacial awareness
was essential because the stroke played
depended upon the direction o f  the
player's movement and where the ball
made contact with the racquet in its arc of
SW ing.
Such precision proved frustratingly
impossible and for a long time I blamed
the programmer, then along c ame

SPORTS
GA
Activision's On Court Tennis. Like most of
Activisions sport games the options are
mind boggling. Not only can you decide
which shot to play by careful joystick
selection, but you can also opt for a style
of p l a y  b y  s elec ting f r o m  f o u r
'personalities' based around current
tennis champions.
Despite this ﬂexibility and control I still
found positioning my player for return
shots to be difﬁcult. It was only when I
tried Commodore's own International
Tennis that I realised why. It all hinges on
viewpoint. Both Match Point and O n
Court take the standard TV viewpoint
from the baseline, parallel to the net. This
has a double disadvantage. The arc and
speed of the ball can only be judged by
the relative positions of the ball and its
shadow but its angle across the court can
be easily seen.
International Tennis uses a viewpoint
which is at right angles to the net. In this
case the speed and arc of the ball can be
seen b u t  t h e  cross-court angle c an
deceive. Despite this last point I found this
version to be the most satisfying version,
In this section I shall also include Jonah
Barrington's Squash (New Generation
Software). This is one of my personal
favourites despite the fact that the voice
synthesis of Jonah calling out the score
gets on my nerves, The court is viewed
from behind the players and the game is
Athletics
as cunning as anything seen in a real
squash court.
This is the most competitive area in terms
of t h e  number o f  games available.
Activision ar e there w ith Decathlon,
Ocean h a v e  D a l e y  T homps on's
Decathlon (with the promise of more
when their  conversions o f  Konames
arcade games  bec ome av ailable),
Martech's Superstar Challenge a n d
Quicksilva's Summer games.
The unique factor with these games is
that you must actually expend energy to
achieve success, just as in the real track
and ﬁeld events. Each program is in fact a
compendium of games but the principle
in most cases in the same. Waggling the
joystick from side to side causes the
athlete to exert himself according to the
rate of waggle; the faster you go, the
faster he goes!
Having watched a room of summer
camp kids trying to outdo one another
with the Activision game, I think I know
what Ken Russell's ﬁlm of Doomsday at
the Wailing Wall would look  like. A
deeply Freudian scenario, indeed.
The real exception to this rule is
Superstar Challenge which requires a
slightly different approach because it
includes a system called powersync. This
means that the speed must be built up
slowly, desperate waggling has very little
effect. In addition to this the squat thrust

S o f t w a r e  r e v i e w s
section requires rapid, co-ordinated
joystick movements to score points. The
range of games is also much wider than
with the other packages, encompassing
cycling, swimming a ls o  featured i n
Summer Games), ball control, canoeing
amongst others including the dreaded
arm dips.
Basketball and Soccer
Until t h e  release o f  Commodore's
International Basketball, the only version
of this sport for the 64 was One-in-One
from Ariolasoft. This is an implementation
of what was a training exercise with only
two players alternately attacking o r
defending a single basket one from the
other. Despite t h e  fac t that i t  was
endorsed by two of America's basketball
greats it never really got through to me.
International Basketball is a different
proposition and its only drawback is the
way it reminds me of the much earlier
International Soccer. In both games you
control the player who is either nearest to
or in possession of the ball. The choice is
then yours as to whether you should pass,
dribble or shoot.
Both ﬁrm favourites of mine, it looks as
if Basketball is going to emulate soccer in
a period of chart domination (and quite
right too).
American imports
America's National Sports, baseball and
football, a r e  av ailable u n d e r  t h e
Activision name which isn't surprising
since the ﬁrm is based in the US. Unfor-
tunately it is this ethnic origination which
will probably hold up the games' progress
in the British software stakes.
As usual, Activision have gone for
complexity o f  game options a t  t h e
expense of graphic display. This makes
the instructions difﬁcult for us Limey's to
grasp and sends someone like me reeling
towards I m a g i n e ' s  m u c h  m o r e
comprehensible World Series Baseball
with its stunning graphic display and well
thought out viewpoint. The game has not
got the versatility of Activision's program
but its position in the software charts in
recent months speaks volumes,
- Unfortunately, the only  version o f
American Football to come from across
the sea is  the Activision one with its
enormous spreadsheet o f  instructions
which I'm still trying to fathom out pro-
perly (wish I'd watched the series o n
Channel 4), I only hope that someone
feels inspired enough t o  devise a
computer rugby game_
Motor racing
Principal contenders in this group are
Pole Position (US Gold) and Pitstop II
(CBS-Epyx), For once I  have n o  real
preference since these are two totally
different approaches t o  t h e  s ame
problem.
Pole Position is the older of the two
games in the sense that it has long been a
favourite with Atari owners. I believe it
was also the inspiration for Bubble Bus'
Aqua Racer which is a wet version of Pole
Position in most senses of the word. The
art of the game is to stay on the track and
overtake the other cars t o  reach o r
maintain ﬁrst place. To summarise the
aims they  are: steering, speed and
position.
Pitstop II on the other hand will not
allow the car to leave the track but tyre
wear results from rubbing along the edge
of the track. Petrol can also run short so
pitstops are essential, hence the name.
The screen is split horizontally to show
your c ar  i n  o n e  window and y our
opponents car in the other. The nice point
about this is that you can watch your car
streak away in your opponent's window,
or vice versa. Your aim in this game
revolves around strategy, can you afford
to make a pitstop or will your petrol and
tyres hold out?
And the rest
When I think of all the sports I've missed it
makes me realise why I  called this a
daunting task earlier. For example there's
Karate in the form of The Way of the
Exploding Fis t ( Melbour ne House),
Graham Gooch's Test Cricket (Audio-
genic), pool and billiards from Bub-
ble Bus  (Hustler) a n d  Visions, t h e
excellent ice-hockey simulation called
Slapshot (Anirog), t h e  n o t  s o good
Motocross (System 3) and BMX Stunts
(letsoft), the punch-drunk Knockout and
esoteric Match Fishing (both Alligata).
I'd especially like to mention Nick
Faido's Open from Argus Press Software
which sets a new level for golf simulations.
Perhaps one day a new sport will be
invented by a computer programmer in
the way that Rollerball was invented by a
ﬁlm crew. Which reminds me there's also
a computer version of that, Rocketball
(OK).
Finally a word of advice. Most sports
games have two player options, use them,
it's muc h mor e fun than playing an
intransigent heap of plastic.

The man with the soldering
iron, Mike Roberts', builds a
device to make the
Commodore cartridge port
more accessible.
THE PROJECT THIS MONTH REQUIRES -
horror of horrors -  the construction of a
PCB, or Printed Circuit Board. Actually for
our purposes the meaning of 'printed' is
different from the usual ink on paper
method.
A PCB is a sheet of  ﬁbreglass (or
possibly other media) that has on one or
more sides a network of copper strips.
Components are attached to the strips
and thus make a circuit. The PCB is made
by getting your bare board, which starts
off with copper all over it. Printing your
design on the side or sides as necessary,
and then removing all the excess copper.
The design is printed on the board in
resistant strips or in etch resistant ink. You
then place the board in a mild acid. The
acid disolves away all the bits you don't
want and hey presto! the ﬁrst stage is
ﬁnished. Next you take a drill and drill any
holes needed for components and solder
them in. Then you're ﬁnished.
As usual all the equipment is available
from Tandys. I  hav e been critisized
recently by naming Tandys as a source of
all components. This is because they are
expensive. True they are a bit pricier, but
they are local and have everything you
want. Other sources tend to be mail order
only, and you have to know what you are
doing to order the bits. However other
suppliers that I  c an recommend are
Maplin, Radio Spares (RS), and Watford
Electronics -  see adverts in electronic
magazines for details and addresses.
Tandy have a PCB etching kit at about
04, how ev er  t h e y  als o s e ll t h e
component parts of this separately and at
a cheaper price, so it may well be worth
asking the assistant for help in getting
exactly what you need. If you do just get
the kit you will also need a saw to cut the
board, and a double sided PCB board,
instead of the single sided one in the kit.
Other items are useful such as ﬁles,
knives, and wire cutters. Otherwise you
will only need the equipment listed in
earlier articles.
Now you've got all the gear you will
want to know what you are building. Well,
it is a bus extension device that connects
cartridges and add ons to the C64 via a
cable. This means that you can attach
switches and LEDs to the bus without
disturbing the cartridge port. Next month
I will be dealing with the various things
that you can attach.
Also as everything attaches onto a
cable it gives you more room to play with
D . I . Y .  H a r d w a r e
at the rear of the machine lot the longer
peripherals that can be attached.
To do this you will need in addition to
that which has been mentioned a length
of ribbon cable (44 lines, though you can
use strips of less such as two strips of 25
way cable as it's cheaper), and a 22 way
double sided 0.1 inch edge connector,
Tandy do not sell these but they are
available from most of the sources listed
above.
Now you must cut the board to the
same size as indicated in the diagram,
check that it ﬁts by shoving it into the
cartridge slot at the back of the CM (with
the power turned off of course!). Next
you must lay out both sides of the board in
the same way as is in the diagram, with the
etch resist pen. The same pattern must go
on both sides of the board and must be of
exactly t he same dimensions as  t he
diagram end of zhe board.
When you have etched your PCB you
can strip the wires at both ends of the
ribbon cable and separate the wires from
each other for about three quarters of an
inch down the insulation. Now bend
alternate wires up and down so that odd
numbered wires go on top of the board
and even numbered wires go down to the
bottom. Tin the wires and the edge of the
board with the thin lines and solder the
wires to the thin lines. Do the same with
the edge connector at the other end. You
will now have your completed board.
Before plugging it in make sure that you
have checked that there are no shorts
between the lines as solder can ﬂy, and
the connections are very close together.
Important Safety Note
The acid used to remove the copper on
the board is  Frerric Chloride and is
extremely dangerous. It should not be
used by persons under 14 at all and only
by people under 16 with supervision. Also
read the diposal instructions carefully -
you wouldn't believe what it  does to
copper piping!

STOCK CONTROL
A superb program which makes extensive use of machine code
to optimise the use of the computer's memory and greatly
improve speed.
Up to 220 stock records may be held on each ﬁle with details
including stock reference code, description, supplier name,
quantity in stock, cost price, sale price, etc.
The program includes the facility to add/modify/delete records,
sort, search, enter stock in or out, or produce a stock summary.
Several printout routines are available, and a ﬁnancial summary
maybe produced giving the total of your stock holding (cost and
sale value), the gross proﬁt margin and the replacement cost
of bringing understocked items up to minimum stock levels.
This program will take much of the tedium out of stock
control and save time and money.

and typing the resulting DATA
statements, it is usual to enter
the points using a digitiser or
graphics tablet.
Knowing the ﬁrst and last
pictures of the sequence, the
picture t h a t  i s  half- w ay
between them can be found in
the way illustrated in Figure 2.
A scheme for drawing it, based
on this, is:
THE O BJ EC T  O F  T H I S
month's project is to develop a
program that, when given the
ﬁrst and last pictures o f  a
sequence, can then draw all the
pictures in between them on
the high-resolution graphics
screen.
The t e c h n i q u e  t h a t
produces a ll t h e  pictures
between the ﬁrst and the last,
and in  the correct order, is
known as "in-betweening". It
is used in the production of
sequences for cartoon ﬁlms.
where computers have taken
much or the drudgery out the
jobs of animation artists.
As this suggests, a successful
program for generating picture
sequences c an b e  used t o
create a n im a t e d  effec ts ,
mobile graphics, or even just a
developing sequence of  still
pictures for  use at different
stages in an adventure game.
The Solution
We can begin from the idea
that a picture can be drawn by
joining up a number of points
with straight lines. Even an
image as complex as that in
Figure 1 can be seen, on close
inspection, t o  c ons is t o f
nothing but straight lines. To
draw on the high resolution
screen, then, we can record the
positions o f  the points that
must be joined by storing the
number of the column and row
of each of the points in the
corresponding elements of a
pair of arrays. If the arrays are
named X and Y, the column
number of the ﬁrst point will be
stored i n  X(1) and its  r ow
number in Y(1), and so on for
the other points. Using N to
C
1 8
make up the picture, it can now
 b e  drawn, with the aid of a
subroutine starting at line 2000
that draws a line from the point
in column X1 and row Vito that
in column X2 and row Y2, by:
PROGRAMMING
PROJECTS

60 X1=X(K-1): Y1=Y(K-1)
70 X2=X(K): Y2=Y(K)
80 GOSUB 2000
90 NEXT K
If we want to join the last point
to the ﬁrst one, making a closed
shape, then we must not forget
to add:
100 X1=X(N): Y1=Y(N)
110 X2=X(1): Y2=Y(1)
120 GOSUB 2000
The subroutine for drawing
the straight line is one that we
have used before in more than
one project, and we will not
dwell on it further (While on
this topic, we shall also make
use o f  a  previously-used
subroutine t o  prepare t he
high-res olution gr aphic s
screen. This one starts at line
500).
In our program, we shall
store t he column and r ow
positions of the points in the
ﬁrst shape in the sequence in
arrays called, respectively, XI-
and YE. In the same spirit, the
positions of the points of the
last picture in the sequence will
be stored in the arrays XL and
YL. Tht program will create its
shapes by  joining only four
points. This is quite enough to
show the idea, but nothing like
enough t o  p r o d u c e  a
convincing picture o f  some
real object. The trouble with
producing realistic pictures
such as Figure 1 is that a very
large number of points must be
joined. To make this possible
without spending days working
out the positions of the points

THE COMMODORE SHOW, KNOWN AS
the PET Show by us Old Timers, is an
annual event eagerly awaited. What new
hardware and software will emerge this
year? Which way is Commodore going,
and, this year, is survival going to be an
issue? These are questions uppermost in
the minds o f  thinking visitors t o  the
Novotel Hammersmith.
These questions ar e made mor e
poignant this year, when we know that
the absence of Jack Tramiel at the top of
Commodore in the United States, and his
re-emergence as the head of Atari, with
the possible intention of taking revenge
on those w ho were responsible for
disposing of him, is making executives
look over their shoulders! Furthermore,
the recent sudden "amicable" departure
of the top U.K. executive is another straw
in the wind for anxious executives.
Finding t h e  Novotel i s  t h e  ﬁrst
problem for  newcomers. Taxi drivers,
usually up to date, do not recognise the
fact that the old Cunard Hotel is now
under new French ownership! The ﬁrst
thing we ﬁnd is that the show is on one
ﬂoor only this year. We remember that
last year's northern show was cancelled at
relatively short notice and we wonder.
We hear that just before this show,
potential exhibitors were offered stands
for no fee at all, and we wonder some
At the time of writing, Apple has just
closed two factories in the United States,
making 1200 people redundant. Here at
home Sinclair seems to be going through
a traumatic period, with Robert Maxwell
bailing out the company, and forcing
Uncle Clive t o  step down as  Chief
Executive. Worrying times indeed, so the
marketing boy s  mus t g e t  i t  r ight!
However, remember the VIC. It sold two
million units and it's memory available
was minute compared with contemporary
machines. A brilliant marketing success.
What about the Plus/4 and the C16?
These have not been well received,
although Guru Jim Butterﬁeld maintains
that they are good machines which have
been u n d e r r a t e d .  N o b o d y  a t
Commodore seems to want to talk much
about these machines, save to say that the
bundling process will continue unabated.
The Plus/4 will now be bundled with an
accounting package from IMPEX, a 1541
disk unit, and a MPS 801 Dot Matrix
Printer, at a saving of (198.
Existing users of the 64 are to be
tempted with a package which enables
them t o save (201 o n a disk drive, a
modem, the disk-based software. Alter-
natively, they offer 1541 disk units, MPS
801 Printer, and the Easyscript Word Pro-
cessor for a saving of [214.
There is one apparent certainty - the
price of the 64 will not come down!
more! Is Commodore cutting back on
However, new buyers are to receive a
E C C I N I N I O D D R I E
P.R. ex penditure, as  w e l l  a s  t o p
personnel?
To the Commodore stand! Here we
ﬁnd displays of the much-announced and
previewed Commodore 128. There it is, as
large as life, with programs running, and
the very smart three speed (automatic
gearbox?) 1571 dis k  dr iv e as  well.
Attempts to ﬁnd out when this will be in
the shops are, as usual in the micro-
computer business, rather fruitless, but
September, or at least by Christmas seems
to be the best guess.
A U n i x - t y p e  m a c h i n e ,  t h e
Commodore 900, is around but prices are
very hush hush. Very high resolution
graphics, multitas k ing, a n d  m u c h
mousework are a feature of this machine.
Is Commodore going back int o the
business sector, after its great success with
games machines? What about the Amiga?
Guarded comments seem to amount to
this; G ail Wellington, Commodore's
dynamic chief of Software (Europe) has
been despatched to the United States as a
trouble-shooting "Shaker and Mover" to
get the Amiga out as soon as possible.
What will it look like? Nobody knows,
because t h e  Marketing people w ill
package it in whatever way seems likely to
bring in the sales.
cassette unit, and International Soccer
same within the current recommended
price of (199.
Commodore PCs are also much in
evidence at the show, although the hard
disk version is not in the shops yet. All the
new gear looks very good and functions
well. The PCscan be seen to operate the
Flight Simulator perfectly, whic h is
normally taken as a good indication of
compatibility.
A Press Launch of the International
Tennis, attended by  Roger Kitter, the
Television Ac tor  w h o  appears i n  a
commercial as a certain aggressive young
tennis player, was absolutely hilarious.
The game its elf following o n  t h e
immensely successful International
Soccer, a n d  t h e  recently launched
International Basketball complete a very
interesting sporting trilogy.
The preview of future music programs
was equally impressive. In addition to
showing the programs which play Beatie
music, pop songs, and also classics, the
same team of programmers and musicians
demonstrated a Sound Synthesiser and
Sampler. It was fascinating to hear how
you could modify the sounds produced
by y o u r  synthesised tr umpet u n t il
satisﬁed, and then turn your attention to
another "instrument". The Sampler,
which showed how the amateur will soon
be able to produce tapes similar in style to
the c ur r ent h i t  " 1 9 "  w as  equally
impressive. These products ar e near
completion but not yet ﬁnished.
This was the story when visiting other
stands too. The Graham Gooch Cricket
Game launched by Audiogenic was on
show, but not for sale, It looked a pretty
good game. A crowd was often present
around t h e  Melbourne House stand,
where their new Karate game was being
played. The graphics on this were really
good, and its attractions were enhanced
by the opportunity to play against the
World Karate champion.
Celebrities were much in evidence
this year. The show was opened by two
actresses from the new James Bond ﬁlm,
and Graham Gooch was on hand on
Sunday morning. Jeff Minter was busily
putting his Psychedelia programs through
their paces on a variety of machines,
including (heresy, this) an Atari! These
programs produce a light show which you
program yourself to ﬂash along with your
Hi Fi system. Really impressive! Especially
so since you can try out your patterns and
record them for future playback, perhaps
at a party!
First Software h a d  a n  impressive
display o f  book s  a n d  software, a l l
translated f r om german Databecker
products, Their books dealt with a v a n ,
of aspects of the Commodore 64, from
machine code to graphics. In addition,
they had an impressive Compiler, called,
misleadingly enough, "Basic 64"I This is
worth examining if you want to compile
BASIC programs into real machine code,
or if you want to compile programs using
extensions t o  BASIC such as Master,
Simon's Basic, Victree and so on.
Phoenix had a range of books for the
64, plus a very good Cribcard, containing
all those references which you waste so
much time looking for  i n  reference
works!
C. Itoh were showing a new version of
their 105 cps. tractor/friction dot matrix
printer. Priced at only £240 and interfaced
through a Commodore Serial connector,
this provided full Commodore compati-
bility including graphics characters and
reverse-ﬁeld printing, in addition t o  a
whole variety o f  enhanced printing
capability, including Bit-image graphics.
Holt Saunders were showing a wide
range of Shiva and "Compute" Books,
including one on the Commodore 128!
Impex were showing their various
interfaces for the 64, together with their
Three-in-One Ac c ounting package,
recently purchased by  Commodore to
boost the Plus/4.
=

N e w .
Handic were showing a  range o f
software, together with some hardware
add-ons, perhaps the most interesting of
which was the sturdy Superbox, which
enables y o u  t o  us e IEEE par allel
Commodore devices with the M, at their
full speeds, and also to choose between
three cartridges plugged into the sockets
provided.
Precision Software had their latest
versions of Superbase and Superscript for
the 64, together with a new program
called Supertype. This enables you to
learn to touch-type with a continuous
skill-rating.
Compunet was being promoted, not
only on its own, but also by the addition of
a three month free trial subscription to
Compucard. This is a computer-based
purchasing network whic h is  usually
accessed by telephone, but which can
now b e accessed b y  owners o f  t he
Commodore 64 and Modern.
Connexions w e r e  s howing their
"Magic mouse" complete with graphics
and oper ational s oftwar e, w h ic h
competed with the Datex MSt Graphic
Mouse on the Ram stand. Ram themselves
were showing a variety of hardware add-
ons, perhaps the most interesting o f
which was the add-on RAM/boards for
the Commodore PC which were very
competitively priced.
Domark Ltd were previewing their
James Bond Game "A View To a Kill",
S H O W N
together with , a very dramatic display
involving a car!
Supersoft had all their usual games and •
utilities on display, but pride of place
went to The Music Synthesiser which had
taken Andrew Trott, the author of the
very successful "Mikro" Assembler some
nine months to create. Very impressive,
and attracting a lot of attention.
The Anirog Stand was also crowded
with enthusiasts. They were showing their
Voicemaster speech synthesiser, the
"Jump Jet" game which is more of a ﬂight
simulator for potential Harrier pilots, and
their very impressive Sprite Machine 64.
This is a really interesting Sprite designer
and animator package. The Mirrorsoft
Company was  showing a t  it s  mos t
prominent in  the Events room, where
Spitﬁre 40 could be played as part of a
competition, complete with a  lifesize
ﬁgure of a Battle of Britain Fighter Pilot,
It is not possible to cover the entire
Show in a short report, there were hard
disk drives, ﬂoppy drives which acted like
hard dis k  driv es , ex tremely  h i g h
resolution gr aphic s  packages f o r
CAD/CAM, the Firebird game Elite was at
last on show, but not yet on sale, a robot, a
turtle etc etc. My best advice to you is do
not miss it next year, if you did this year!.

Alien Webb continues his
series with an explanation of
raster interrupts.
WELL LAS1 MONTH'S EPISODE WAS
a little short and easy to type in. This
month you're going to work for your
living. Whilst the main loader will take a
while typing in, I feel sure that you will
ﬁnd the investment in effort worthwhile.
This month's subject is the vital area of
raster interrupts. I'm probably on fairly
safe ground if I say that there aren't many
games which don't use this handy feature
to some extent. By the time you've read
this article, you'll know why.
First a small dose of gentle background
theory. In order to produce a picture, TVs
and monitors have an electron gun which,
under the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld,
scans the end of the tube. The picture
information is carried down this electron
beam. Each picture is built u p as the
electron beam scans across the screen as a
sequence of raster lines. This all happens
so quickly that you don't actually see the
scanning. The 64, however, has a couple
of registers at $D011 and $D012 which
keep a record of the raster line being
scanned at any given instant. You can also
write a value to these registers and by
setting bit 1 of register $D019 tell the 64 to
perform a n interrupt every time the
speciﬁed raster line is  scanned. This
feature, combined with a little jiggery
pokery t o  allow f o r  t h e  difference
between the SO hertz interrupt rate and
the 60 hertz mains frequency and you
have a  raster interrupt routine. This
routine can be directed to any machine
code routine you choose. Since • we're
talking about scanning the screen, the
usual application is to graphics.
The most frequent applications of
raster interrupts are the generation of
more than eight sprites on the screen and
the creation of different graphics zones.
will ignore sprites since this application is
tricky to implement and not necessary if
you u s e  a  s ens ible appr oac h t o
programming.
The basic of the program given here is
to provide the means of specifying the

The basic loader is all you need to set
up the interrupts. If you have a machine
code monitor and want to save it as a
direct loading ﬁle, the routine occupies
$C000 to SC24F. Three commands are
available as summarised in Figure 1.
On activating the interrupts, you
will be greeted with a rather diabolical
effect of grey bands across the screen and
border. This is simply to let you know
something has happened. The parameters
in the other two commands are described
in Figure 2.

extended mode and bit map. R2 selects
normal text or  multicolour mode. ME
selects the character memory position.
Some examples are shown in Figure 3.
The system detects the current bank
setting so that you can use any bank you
choose (the addresses for ME in table 2
must be adjusted by adding BANK NO *
16384). If you use the default bank 0, life is
simple until you want to use redeﬁned
characters or bit mapping. To use these,
you must raise the start of BASIC (very
messy). It is better to use another bank.
Listing 2 shows how to move to Bank 2.
This Bank has an image of the character
ROM so that it's easy to use. Don't forget
to protect this area, however with:
Effect
Upper case text
lower case text
multicolour bit map at $2000
multicolour lower case text
This effectively reduces the memory for
your programs to 37141 bytes.
The bes t solution, f o r  t h e  more
knowledgeable, is to use bank 3 with the
screen put at $C400. It will be necessary to
copy a character set to $C800. With this
arrangement, the area behind the Kernal
ROM can be used for bit mapping with no
loss in BASIC memory at all.
The second command in  Figure 1
updates the entire screen. This enables
you to rapidly change the screen. The
screen is effectively divided into 49 strips.
Their positioning i s  such that they
correspond t o  t h e  normal lines  o f
characters. The last command enables
you to alter any speciﬁed strip. Both of
these commands can be called before to
initialise the interrupts should you want to
get an instantaneous display.
Initially, the system assumes that the
screen is at its default value of $0400 or
the corresponding position in the other
banks. If you need t o  use a different
position by poking 835 as follows:

The simplest way to get to grips with the
routines is to try the two demonstration
routines. NOTE that both of these use
BANK 2 so you must run listing 2 ﬁrst.
I hope you ﬁnd these routines both
versatile and fascinating. In the ﬁnal part
of this series, I will discuss the concepts of
screen windows and provide a machine
code routine for their manipulation.

the mysteries of
searching and sorting.
1 he various methods of sorting
data into some kind of order
has occupied the minds o f
programmers for many years.
Sorting data can be a lengthy
process even to a computer
and there are many different
solutions to the problem. In
fact, to cover the subject of
sorting i n  any detail would
justify a  separate series o f
articles lasting several months.
You may be asking why so
many routines are necessary,
surely there must be one better
than the rest so why burden the
literature w it h  t h e  others?
Unfortunately, i t  i s  n o t  as
simple as this. Choosing the
right one could depend on a
variety o f  fac tors . Some
solutions are easy to program
and r e l a t i v e l y  e a s y  t o
understand so it may be that
these factors alone might
inﬂuence t h e  choice. F o r
example, the solution known
as the bubble sort is popular
because it is simple. Indeed,
the bubble sort is reasonably
efﬁcient providing there is only
a small number of items to be
sorted. However, when the
number of items increases, the
bubble sort takes far too long
for most practical purposes
because the sorting time is
proportional to the square of
the number of items. Thus, to
sort 400 items  c ould tak e
sixteen times as long as to sort
100 items. In this article, we
shall go straight t o  a highly
efﬁcient solution for sorting a
large number of items when
they are in random order. It is
called the Quicksort and there
is probably n o  signiﬁcantly
faster method for  sorting a

contribute signiﬁcantly to the
time so it follows that the sor-
ting time approaches the ideal
linear relationship. That is to
say, it is almost directly propor-
tional to n. For example, the
time t o  sort 400 items can,
under the best case conditions,
be not much more than four
times longer than the time to
sort 100 items . Compar e
this with the bubblesort ﬁgures
given i n  t h e  p r e v i o u s
paragraph.
The central idea behind the
Quicksort is  based o n  t h e
observation that the speed of
the simple bubble sort is quite
acceptable pr ov iding t h e
number of items in the list is
small. It follows that if we have
a large array and split it into two
sublists containing different
ranges of numbers and sort
each list separately, we will save
a lot of sorting time. To do this,
we make an intelligent guess as
to the array element that,
hopefully, will have a value
s omewhere a r o u n d  t h e
middle. This element will be
known as the pivot. All array
elements having a value less
than the pivot will be placed
above it in the lower half of the
array and all elements having a
value greater than the pivot
placed in the higher half. If
these two portions of the array
are sorted separately, either
side of the pivot, then the array
will be completely sorted. The
estimate of the pivot value is
very important. For instance,
we could choose the ﬁrst array
element o r  t h e  las t array
element in  a  random array.
However, if the list is partially
sorted, a s  m a y  oc c ur  i n
practice, t h e  performance
may b e  seriously degraded
because the pivot will be too
far offset fr om t he median
value t o  m a k e  t h e  s p lit
worthwhile. It would be like
cutting a pack of cards leaving
about 4 on one side and 48 on
the other. This effect can be
reduced s tatis tic ally  b y
choosing the pivot as the mid
point element o f  the array.
There are, o f  course, many
other ways o f  obtaining the
pivot but we will employ this
method. Incidentally, it is only
fair to point out that, under
worst case conditions, t h e
sorting time can be as poor as
that for a bubble sort but this is
extremely unlikely to happen
in practice.
One method o f  imple-
menting Quicksort is to keep
splitting down the main array
holding the items until they
each contain, say, 15 elements
at most and then bubble sort
them. Taking this idea to the
extreme, if we carry on taking
this partitioning process to the
limit, then each sublist will
eventually contain only  one
element -  in which case there
will be no need to employ a

bubble sort at all!
To understand the Quick-
sort and to experiment with
various numbers of items in an
array, i t  is  nic e t o  have a
program w h i c h  inc ludes
facilities f o r  ﬁlling i t  w it h
random characters. We hope
you w ill ﬁnd Program 12.1
useful in this respect.
Using the program
The ﬁrst screen prompt will be
"Set up how many strings?".
We suggest you try this ﬁrst
with a small number, say 10 in
order to check if everything is
OK. (It is conceivable that you
may have made one or more
keying er r or s  w h e n  y o u
entered the listing.) It will be
easy to spot any out-of-order
items because there is plenty of
room on the screen to hold 10
of them. Once the number of
items to be sorted have been
entered, t h e  program ﬁrst
27

displays the items in random
order. The clock then starts and
the sorting commences. At the
end of the sort, the time taken
is displayed. The program then
arranges for the sorted list to be
stored on cassette tape which
means, o f  course, y ou w ill
have to respond to the usual
screen pr ompts  f o r  t a p e
transfer. In case you may be
wondering why we want to put
the list on tape, it should be
explained that the tape will be
required for the next program
which deals  w i t h  b in a r y
searching.
After you are satisﬁed that
the program works with 10 you
should s ettle d o w n  t o  a
marathon session, trying out
successively larger numbers of
items a n d  r ec or ding t h e
timings. Finally try it with a few
thousand items t o  convince
yourself that the Quicksort is a
vast improv ement o n  t h e
primitive bubble sort. You will
notice that successive timings
on the same number of items
can differ . T his  is  under-
standable since the array is
ﬁlled with random characters.

How t h e  program
works
Dimensioning
The array AS(B%) holds the list
of string items. T he stack
requires t w o  arrays, eac h
reserving a  conservative 1 6
locations, S1(16) and S2(16).
These arrays are dimensioned
in line 50.
Filling the dummy array
The random characters ar e
generated b y  t h e  nes ted
FOR/NEXT loops in lines 60 to
130. The inner loop, amongst
other things, ensures that only
upper case letters are allowed
to enter the array. Random
numbers between 1 and 26 are
generated in line 100 and the
next line adds 65 to them which
lifts them to the ASCII region
for upper case letters.
Displaying the array items
The outer loop repeats the
process for all array items and
prints them out in the unsorted
state (see line 150). The time
clock is started in line 200. The
sort routine requires the last
and ﬁrst array index t o  b e
included in the sort, called the
head (H%) and tail (T%) which
are assigned in line 210 before
the c all t o  GOSUB 1000.
Quicksort thus has the advant-
age of sorting items within any
chosen limits of the array. For
instance by setting T% to 20, we
may s ort jus t t h e  ﬁrst 2 0
array elements.
On returning from the sub-
routine, the sorted items are
displayed by  the FOR/NEXT
loop, lines 240 to 260.
Quicksort subroutine
This occupies the bottom of the
program f r o m  l i n e  1000
onwards. As you can see, it is
not exactly light reading so it
will require more than the
casual glance to unravel it all.
Line 1000: initialises the stack
pointer SP% to zero.
Line 1010: Form an outer loop
which executes repeatedly
while t h e  H%<T%. These
variables represent the head
and tail pointers of the current
list respectively.
Line 1020: The pivot, PS, is
obtained by adding the head
and tail pointers (H% and -
and dividing by two. Taking the
integer value of the result will
hopefully index the median
value string of the list or sublist
(see above).
Line 1030: Initialis es  t h e
pointers I% and J% to start the
scans from the head and tail of
the current list.
Line 1040: The index I% scans
the current list from its head
until an element is found that is
greater than or equal to the
pivot string, PS.
Line 1050: The index J% scans
the current list from its tail until
an item is found that is less than
or equal to the pivot string, PS
Line 1060: Pr ov ided t h e
indexed I% and J% have not
met or crossed the elements
are swopped over so that they
are in the correct half of the list.
Further s c ans  a r e  t h e n
performed until another pair of
elements ar e found i n  the
wrong sublist.
Lines 1070 to 1080: When the
indexes I% and J% eventually
meet or pass (I% ->=1%) the list
is split into two sublists. All
elements above I% will be less
than o r  equal t o  the pivot
string, PS, and all elements
below J% will be greater than
or equal to the pivot string. If
both scans terminate w it h
I%=J% then the element at this
array position is equal to the
pivot string, PS and is placed in
neither sublist. (It is already in
its correct array position). On
the other hand i f  the scans
terminate with I% >J% then the
items between I% and J% are
all equal to the pivot string, PS,
and are excluded from either
sublist.
Lines 1090 to 1130: The stack
pointer SP% is  incremented
ready for placing sublist limits
on the stack. The array index
limits of the lower sublist are
P% and Q %  (head and tail
respectively) and R% and S%
for the higher sublist. The head
and tail parameters o f  t he
sublists yet to be stored are put
on the stack. Thus if we are
presently sorting t h e  array
between ASS(PcX3) and AS(Q%)
then It% and 5% would be
placed on the stack s o the
sublist AS(R'X,) t o  AS(Q%)
could b e  sorted later. I n
practice it is better to put the
longer sublist limits o n  the
stack and process the shorter
sublist immediately. This is the
task performed in line 1100.
Each t ime a  lis t is  further
partitioned in the outer loop
the process is repeated. On exit
of the loop in line 1130, the
sublists, whos e parameters
were placed on the stack, are
taken in sequence (last in, ﬁrst
out) and sorted in  a similar
manner.
It i s  o f t e n  s tated t h a t
Quicksort uses a lot of memory
because the program listing is
much longer than, say, a simple
bubble sort. Also it uses more
variables and needs to employ
a ﬁxed stack area of memory.
However, the extra memory
used by the stack itself is not
excessive. The number of stack
levels needed by Quicksort is
given by LOG2(N). Therefore
to sort say 4,096 numbers the
number of stack levels needed
would only be LOG2(4096) =12.

times to be expected see Table

Searching arrays
Searching for a particular item
within an array is a common
processing requirement, even
more common than sorting.
The problem is concerned with
comparing items in the array
with the search key until a
match is found.
Sequential o r  linear
search
This is  the search algorithm
most widely used because it is
simple and obvious. It involves
starting from the beginning of a
list and sequentially comparing
each element in turn with the
search k ey  i n  order that a
match m a y  eventually b e
found. If the end of the list is
reached without ﬁnding a
match the search is deemed to
have failed. W e  us ed this
simple technique in the ﬁling
program listed in the June issue
of 'Your Commodore'.

compared with the item to be
matched. If the item is smaller
than the required item, the
search continues in  the ﬁrst
half of the array. If the item is
larger, the search concentrates
on the second half of the array.
On locating which half, the
process continues as before by
ﬁrst testing the middle item in
that half. Eventually, by
continually halving, a nd
testing, the required data item
is either found or declared to
be non existent. O n  the

surface, this may seem a longer
process t h a n  t h e  s imple
sequential search but this is
only because i t  has  taken
longer t o  explain. ( As  a n
analogy, a spiral staircase is easy
to visualise but try explaining
what it looks like to those who
have never seen one.)
The equation of interest is
Average number  o f  c om-
parisons = LOG (N)
where N is the total number of
data items to be searched.
This is a startling result and
worth studying an example, if
only to illustrate the superiority
of the binary search over the
simple s equential search.
Assume we wish t o  locate a
speciﬁc item from within a total
list of 10,000 items. We will
compare both methods
(a) Sequential
Av er age n u m b e r  o f
comparisons =  N / 2  =
10,000/2 --,- 5000
(b)Binary search:
Average number of com-
parisons = LOG(N) = LOG
(10,000) =  1 3  ( w h e n
rounded).
Even with one million items,
the number o f  comparisons
would o n ly  b e  about 2 0
whereas 500,000 w ould b e
needed with linear searching.
Assuming each comparison in
BASIC takes 20 milliseconds,
this would mean a linear search
time of 10,000 seconds (nearly
three hours!). However, it is
only fair to stress once more
that a binary search can only be
carried out o n a  previously
sorted array, whereas t h e
sequential search makes n o
demands at all on the order of
the ﬁle items. If an array is small
in size, it may not always be
worth t r o u b lin g  t o  s o r t
beforehand and i t  certainly
would not be sensible to sort it
just for  the sake of  using a
binary search. O n the other
hand, if a ﬁle is to be accessed
often and additions to the ﬁle
are infrequent t h e n binary
searching is the ideal solution.
Demonstration
program
Program 12.2 will allow you to
judge for yourself whether the
binary is superior to the linear
search method because either
may be used in the program.
You will remember that you
will already have a randomly
ﬁlled dummy array already on
tape, a  res idue f r o m  t h e
previou; program.
Using the program
The p r o g r a m  b e g in s  b y
expecting you to load the array.
Make sure that before running
the program, that the tape is set
to the correct position and all
tape keys are OFF, otherwise
there w ill b e  none o f  the
customary screen prompts.
Once t h e  tape has  been
loaded, you will be asked to
supply the search string. Next,
you will answer the question
P r o g r a m m i n g
whether you want to use the
linear, (L) or binary, (B) method
of searching. The search then
begins. I f  t h e  s earc h i s
successful, the array position
number of the matching item is
displayed followed by the time
taken t o  ﬁnd it. It is worth
trying this  o u t  w it h  b o t h
methods many times over in
order to be satisﬁed that the
binary method is far superior.
Try it with strings in several
array positions including the
ﬁrst and last. You should have a
look a t  t h e  unsorted array
positions in order to pick out in
advance a few matching items.
This can be easily done in direct
mode. F or  example, PRINT
AS(50).
How t h e  program
works
The body of the program is
quite straightforward, r e -
quiring o n l y  a n  o u t l i n e
explanation. The ﬁrst item on
the tape is the number of items
which is read into B% ready for
DIMensioning the array in line
60. The FOR/NEXT loop which
follows, reads the tape data
into the array AS(N). The search
key (the character string which
is to be searched for) entered
by the operator in line 110, is
assigned to F$. Depending on
whether t h e  oper ator , i n
response to the prompt at line
130, enters L or B, either the
linear or the binary search sub-
routine is called.
The l i n ear  search
subroutine
This extends from 1000 to 1050.
The loop counter is I% which is
ﬁrst initialised to zero before
entering the loop and is then
incremented each time round.
The end of loop test, that all
items have been checked, is at
the top (line 1020). Also in this
line, a ﬂag. FL% is set to zero.
The loop begins by comparing
FS with the ﬁrst array item
which will be A$(1). The loop
continues t o  revolve until a
match is found, at which point,
the ﬂat FL% is set to 1 and the
loop exits prematurely by  a
branch t o  RETURN. Af t er
returning to the main program,
lines 190 or 200 (depending on
whether the ﬂag was left at 1 or
0) will display either the item
position, which will be inj%, or
display t h e  " S t r i n g  n o t
present" message.
The binary search
subroutine
This occupies lines 2000 to 2070.
Line 2000 assigns the index
numbers, L O %  a n d  H I %
respectively, to the initial array
limits. The next line is the start
of the main loop and ﬁnds the
mid point of the current sublist
by simply halving the sum of
the supplied limits LO% and
HI% each time round the loop.
Lines 2020, 2030 and 2040
perform the comparisons.
Line 2020 tests for equality
between the search string F$
and the middle array item. If
the match is found, the ﬂag,
FL% i s  s et t o  1  a n d  t h e
subroutine returns.
Line 2030 tests if the search
string is less that AS(J%). (This
means i f  t h e  ASCII c ode
numbers are less, not the array
numbers.) If they are, then HI%
is then assigned to one less than
the half way position. Line 2040
is similar except that it tests if
F% is greater than AS(j%). If so,
then LO% is assigned to 1 more
than the half way position.
These t h r e e  tes ts  a r e
carried out, each time round
the main loop, until either a
match is found or all data has
been s e a r c h e d  w i t h o u t
success. The latter condition
occurs when LO% becomes
higher than HI% in line 2050 in
which case the ﬂag FL% is set to
0 before the RETURN.

PROGRAMMING
THE C16
mommilmimmammamm
ﬁnd out lust what goes
where with the ﬁrst of Joe
Nicholson's four part series
for the C-16.
THE C-16 USER MANUAL IS A  FINE
introduction t o  BASIC, b u t  lacks a
description o f  t h e  many powerful
facilities accessible outside o f  t h e
standard BASIC commands. Instead, it
refers you t o  the C-16 Programmer's
Reference Guide which remains unpub-
lished at the time of writing. This series of
articles sets out to explain these extra
facilities.
The Memory Map
As explained in the December issue of
'Your Commodore', much o f  t h e
hardware of the C-16 is based on one
large chip, the 7501 or TED chip, which
combines a 6510 processor with a two
channel sound generator, a ﬁrst class
graphics generator, and some other
important functions.
To plan a machine code program, it is
important to know the way in which the
processor uses the available memory. The
overall memory map of the C-16 is shown
in Figure 1. The main partitions are as
follows:
$0000-$07FF (0-2047)
2K of RAM used by the operating
system. As on all 6502 based computers,
ZERO PAGE is from $0000 to SOOFF and the
STACK is between $0100 and $01FF (256 to
511).
$0800-SURFF (2048-3071)
TED attribute bytes. Used by the C-16
for the colour (Bits 0-3) and luminance
(Bits 4-6) of the low resolution screen. As
only 1000 of the 1024 bytes are used,
addresses S0B8E-$013FF (3048-3071)
appear to be unused.
SOCOO-SOF (3072-4095)
TED character pointers. These are the
characters for the low resolution screen.
Again only 1000 bytes are used, so
addresses SOFE8-SOFFF appear t o  b e
unused.
$1000- (4096 -)
This is the area reserved for BASIC. In
fact, BASIC starts at address $1001 (4097),
as address $1000 (409€) must always
contain 0. If high resolution mode has not
been selected, BASIC can go u p  t o
address S3FFF (16383), but if it has been
selected BASIC can only be written up to
address $17FF (6143).
If high resolution mode has been
selected, the area of memory between
$1800 and $.3FFF (6144 and 16383) is used as
follows:
$1800-$113FF (6144-7167)
Contains the luminance information
for the Hi-res screen,
S1C00-$1FFF (7168-8191)
Contains the colour information for
the Hi-res screen,
$2000-$3FFF (8192-16383)
Contains the Hi-res screen data.
$4000-57FFF (16384-32767)
A mirror image of the bottom 16K of
memory. Rumour has it that this space
would have been occupied by an extra
16K of RAM, but perhaps Commodore
thought this might be too competitive
with the '64.
$8000- (32768- )
The Commodore-16's operating
system in ROM.
S13000-SD7FF (53248-55295)
The two ROM character sets (upper
case/graphics, and upper/lower case).
$F 00-SF F3F (65280-65343)
Registers to control the TED chip.
These registers are used to control sound,
graphics, timers and other important
functions. A number of these registers will
be explained in detail in later articles.
F81-$F 3  (65409-65523)
The Kernal jump table. This contains
jump statements to important routines in
the C-16's operating system such as store
or retrieve data on tape or disk, output
text t o  screen o r  printer, scan the
keyboard, update the system clock, ttc.
These routines function in the same way,
and have the same entry points as the
Kernal in the Commodore 64.
SHFC-SFFFID (65532-65533)
These registers hold the address that
the microprocessor will jump to on a Cold
Start, le, when the computer is ﬁrst
turned on, or when the reset button is
pushed. This address is $FFF6 (65526)
$FFFE-$FFFF (65534-65535)
These registers hold the address that
the microprocessor jumps t o  o n  a
machine code BRK instruction. This
address i s  SFC133 (64691). A  BRK
instruction makes the C-16 jump into the
Monitor with the message 'BREAK'.
The Plus-4 achieves 60K of RAM free
for BASIC because it banks the top 32K of
memory, switching out the operating
system and switching in 32K of RAM. This
memory banking is achieved using small
machine code routines stored in RAM,
which bank in the top 32K of memory,
read or write to a byte of the memory and
then bank the operating system back in.
These routines are still in the C-16, and are
called by the operating system whenever
a byte of RAM in the BASIC area is to be
read from or written to. This means that
the C-16 is capable of expansion to give
the same amount of memory for BASIC as
the Plus-4. Also it may be one of the
reasons why the C-16 SAVEs and LOADs
slower than the C-64!
Where To Store Machine Code
Unlike the Commodore 64, there is no
deﬁnite area in memory set aside for
machine code. Code cannot just b e
popped into any free space however.
When t h e operating system handles
strings it continually ﬁlls up the free part
of t h e  BASIC area w it h  garbage,
overwriting even the best machine code
Space Invaders game stored there. There
are, however, three ways to overcome
this:
1. U se the area below BASIC.
The following regions appear to be
unused on the C-16:
$05F5-$0650 (1525-1629)
Covers the ' RAM areas used for
banking.' These do not appear to be used
on the C-16 (no doubt they are on the
Plus-4) making the space available for
machine code.
$065E-$06EB (1630-1771)
These were intended for some speech
package, so if you don't happen to own
one, this is also free for machine code.
$06EC-$07AF (1772-1967)
This is the BASIC run time (or GOSUB)
stack. If your BASIC program does not
have dozens of nested GOSUBs, then a
large proportion o f  this memory is
available also. As the run time stack writes
downwards from $07AF, it is wise not to
use the top part of this area. SO6EC-50760

(1772-1888) is as much as I would normally
use.
Therefore, an area from $05F5 to about
$0760 (1525 to about 1888, about 363 bytes)
appears to be usable for machine code.
On the Plus-4 from 1630 to 1888 would be
available. On the C-16, the area between
$05F 5 (1525) and S06FF (1791) is not wiped
when the machine is completely reset,
making permanent routines, such as
extensions to BASIC, possible.
2. M o v e  up the start of BASIC.
This is an excellent place in which to
store machine code as it allows machine
code programs of virtually any length to
be written t o an area that cannot be
touched by BASIC. Unlike lowering the
top of BASIC (see section 3), it allows the
use o f  both low  and high resolution
screens, Addresses $2B and $2C (43 and
44) contain the low byte and high byte
respectively o f  t h e  'Start o f  BASIC'
pointer. This  initially contains $1001
1,4097). To move the start of BASIC up 1K to
$1401 (5121), therefore type:
POKE 44,20
The byte before the start o f  BASIC,
initially 4096, but 5120 when BASIC is
moved up 1K, must contain a 0 for BASIC
programs t o  work. Therefore i n  this
example ty pe t h e  following BEFORE
moving the start of BASIC:
POKE 5120,0
Finally, it is always wise to perform a NEW
command, to set the string pointers to
their correct values. BASIC is now moved.
All programs loaded after this  w ill
automatically load into the new address
(including the C-16 Assembler recently
published i n  this magazine) enabling
machine code to be assembled straight
into the free 1K block.
3. M o v e  down the top of BASIC.
This has the disadvantage of limiting
the user to either low resolution or high
resolution screen memory conﬁgurations.
To move the top of BASIC, the 'Highest
address us ed b y  BASIC' pointer a t
addresses $37 and $38 (55 and 56) and the
'Bottom o f  string storage' pointer at
addresses 133 and $34 (51 and 52) must be
altered as desired. Finally a CLR command
should be executed.
For instance in low resolution mode,
to make 1K available at the top of memory
between $3C00 and $3FFF (15360 and
16383), type the following:
POKE 56,59:POKE 52,59:CLR
Addresses 55 and 51 already contain 255
and d o  not need t o be changed. ie,
59°156+255=15359. This instruction sets
the top of BASIC pointers to one less than
the start of the desired block. As 'CLR' is
used it should be placed at the start of the
program to preserve the variables.
Next month we shall be dealing with
programmable graphic characters, one of
the m o s t  impor tant fac ilities  n o t
explained in the manual.

DO YOU LIKE FLYING? OR PERHAPS you
prefer underground tunnels, f u ll o f
ghostly beings. On the other hand, you
may be the sort of person who enjoys
underwater exploration? Well, in  this
game you will need to do all three, in
whichever order you like, and in each
phase you will encounter enough hazards
to last a lifetime!
Timeslip owes something to Scramble-
type games, but it gives a new and original
twist to the theme which must surely
make it a winner. The screen is divided
laterally into three sections, each of which
scrolls independently and very smoothly.
In each section there are a dozen time-

orbs (they look like clocks to me) which
you must destroy in order to neutralise
the rather frequent, worrying timeslips
which threaten to destroy your planet.
Depending o n  t h e  scenario y ou
choose, you are equipped with a star-
ﬁghter, a submarine or just Shanks's Pony,
and you have a very effective ray gun.
Points are scored for each hazard you
destroy, ranging from trees to cannon,
but the most important factor is the time
taken. You are allowed 24 "hours" to
accomplish your mission and„ although
you have unlimited lives, you lose 30
precious minutes for each collision. In
some mysterious manner you can gain
extra time by shooting fuel pods and oil
barrels.
Graphically, the game is quite superb.

THE LATEST OFFERING FROM US GOLD
has been given the most impressive
launch to date. This took place at the RAF
Museum i n  Hendon and was even
attended by a number of members of the
original hastily-formed a n d  her oic
squadron.
The strategic effect of  the raid on
which t h e  same is  based has been
disputed in recent years, but its impact on
the morale of both sides has never been
seriously questioned. It remains to be
seen whether the game lives up to the real
event and all its publicity.
By and large I think it succeeds.
I should say straight away that I think
that the most enjoyment will come if you
have read the history of the raid, either in
Paul Brickhill's book, or Guy Gibson's
own 'Enemy  Coas t A h e a d " .  T h e
peculiarities o f  the raid, involving two
lights s hining downwards fr om t h e
bottom o f  the bomber, and a  crude
home-made range-ﬁnder for dropping
the bouncing bomb will then be fully
understood. Packaging is very good. The
booklet contains reports by  both the
bomb's designer and the leader of the
programmer has worked miracles to ﬁt it
into 16K. The sound effects are limited,
but perfectly adequate.
Of the two dozen or more C16 games I
have seen, this is undoubtedly the best
and I recommend it without hesitation -it
just shows what can be achieved with

realism.
During the game you play a series of
roles, from pilot through navigator,

You must plan your course, avoiding
anti-aircraft ﬁre. There is an intelligence

(surprise!) - you can damage the engines
with excessive revs!. If you have selected
the Squadron Leader option, (in which
you must make a successful take-off with
your heavily loaded bomber), then the
rudder trim is also your department.
Very good graphics of the quality of
those in "Beachhead" accompany your
attempts to shoot down night ﬁghters and
barrage balloons, whilst avoiding enemy
"ﬂak" too.
For successful pilots, (or those who

done. If you keep height and speed right,
and release t h e  b o mb  at  t h e  right
moment, you may manage to wreck the

Great Value for money and a lot of fun.

THIS IS AN IMPORT BY ARIOLASOFT,
previously produced by Broderbund in

to cruising power. The radar display
shows an enemy aircraft to be eight miles

Suddenly I feel very lonely. My hours of

being just another ﬂight simulator. The
turbo program loads in 90 seconds and
while you decide which skill level to select

level set, ﬂight control informs you that
you are "Clear for take-off Lieutenant/

Many extra features make this a very

cheat your way onto later screens, if

Either of these manoeuvres means your

score table; they are purely for practice!.
The best feature of all is that you can
design your own game. If you are not
satisﬁed with the 150 different puzzles
and scenes, you can design as many new
games as you like for yourself.
The k it  o f  parts can b e  used t o
construct an inﬁnite number of different
screens, simply by using numeric keys to
put diggable and undiggable ﬂoors,
ladders, bar s  f o r  hand-ov er-hand
movement, g o ld  chests, and enemy
forces, wherever you wish. Very complete
instructions are given which seem to be
foolproof, even going so far as to advise
you about only having one player on your
screen, and saving the game onto your
own data disc.
Graphics are good and sound quite
good.
All in all this is an excellent buy and
highly recommended.
I was rather disappointed with the
combat sequence. The enemy aircraft
approaches head on and it is necessary to
cover it with a gun-sight before ﬁring a
missile. If the enemy gets closer than two
miles you will b e destroyed and the
Mayday message transmitted. I n  m y
opnion, a full-blooded dog ﬁght, with
each aircraft jostling for position, would
have been more exciting.
The landing sequence, as one would
expect, is the most difﬁcult. Depending
on the skill level, the conditions can vary
from calm to mountainous seas and from
calm to stormy weather. In the toughest
conditions, the aircraft bounces around in
a manner likely to drain the colour from
the cheeks of the squeamish! No wonder
it takes so long to train Harrier pilots!
As with all ﬂight simulators, thorough
reading of the manual, coupled with a
mastery of joystick and key control, is
required for a successful ﬂight. Because
the combat sequence is so tame, by
today's standards, I doubt if this program
will have lasting appeal to the younger
player. I f  the price had been E2 less

have given this program 4 stars.

them. T h e  enemies  t h a t  y o u  c an
encounter while defending the eggs are
Hedgehogs, Rats, Stoats, Snakes and other

Zeppelin Rescue
IT IS A PLEASURE TO PLAY AN ARCADE
type game which does not involve rapid
movement. Piloting a Zeppelin or airship
around the skies of Los Angeles trying to
rescue people is not the simplest of tasks.
This is particularly true when you are
endangered by acid rain clouds which will
instantly break through the envelope of
your airship. You must also avoid hitting
bridges, buildings and even your home
base. The slow but inexorable progress of
your airship means that y o u  mus t
anticipate the need to stop in good time
and give the appropriate command. It
must be rather like commanding one of
those ocean going fuel tankers which take
about a mile to stop. This game will be
enjoyed b y  people w h o  g e t  their
excitement fr om creative endeavour,
namely rescuing people, rather than
destroying them.

difﬁculty, you will probably want the
maximum number of four, at least to start
with.
The joystick enables you to move the
airship hor iz ontally , v er tic ally  o r
diagonally. Somewhat strangely this last is
achieved by moving the joystick twice,
once in each direction making up the
angle, that is hit North and East to go
Northeast. This produces a ﬁne sense of
confusion. The airship has two speeds, the
faster speed being induced by a second
push of the joystick in the same direction.
To stop you must touch the joystick once
if you are travelling at low speed and twice
if at high. If you hit it once too often, the
airship w ill rotate o n  its  axis before
starting t o  move off in  the opposite
direction! Inexperienced pilots will ﬁnd
the realistic unresponsive nature of the
airship takes some getting used to! Speed
seems to be correct, and the engine note
seems to be particularly realistic.
You have ﬁve different screens, each
of them contains skyscrapers inhabited by
panic stricken people, 48 in all. They are
under threat from various environmental
hazards and need to be rescued using the
people scooper. This is a small hook at the
bottom of the machine.

You must economise on fuel because
each time you touch the joystick you use
up ﬁve gallons out of 1000, and of course
time is running out. If you should manage
to rescue 48 people you are supplied with
another 48. A hero's work is never done!
One of the problems with designing a
game is the compromise between making
it difﬁcult enough to maintain interest,
whilst easy enough t o  encourage
perseverence in the early stages. This has
been well covered in Zeppelin Rescue, by
providing a practice mode, in which the
acid rainclouds are missing. thus you can
learn t o  manoeuvre the craft before
things get tricky.
This i s  a  w e l l  des igned game
combining difﬁculty with slow action.
There is a need for this type of game, for
not everyone can respond to the more
frenetic type of Arcade experience. The
use of graphics and colour is of a high
standard, and the limited use of sound is
extremely realistic. M o r e  levels o f
difﬁculty would be an advantage.

Murder on the Zinderneuf is based on
a good idea. Being placed in the 1930s,
and in a conﬁned space, it is very clearly
set in Agatha Christie country.
The characters cannot escape your
questioning, since the airship will not land
for another 15 hours, when the trans-
Atlantic journey ends. You have 36
minutes of real time to solve the mystery
in this graphical adventure. You choose
which detective you are going to be. The
origins of the names are not difﬁcult to
see: Agatha Marbles, Inspector Klutzeau,
lieutenant Cincinnato etc.
You put your questions in one of a
number of styles, and can wander about
merely observing suspects' behaviour.
You start off in the Dining Room. Once
you have been told who is missing, you
are on your own. You will probably soon
wish you had chosen to be a different
detective, because your effectiveness is
determined by who you are! Clues are
found by entering a room and moving
round it. The scrolling graphics as you do
this are good. Some of the clues may be
downright misleading. This is no mere
"Cleudo" type game.

circumstances except that Willy has been
in hospital while little green men
extended his house, which could account
for the inclusion of a spaceship. The
house is full of a dazzling array of hazards,
platforms, ropes and ladders must be
negotiated t o  complete the clean-up
mission.
In all there are over 100 rooms some of
which can only be accessed by the more
'enterprising' space traveller after

cannot question the same subject twice
without having a go at someone else in
between.
You can accuse a suspect whenever
you feel you have enough evidence. If
that suspect is guilty. AND if the suspect
believes you have enough evidence to
make the accusation stick, the game ends.
You will get a rating dependent on your
performance. Speed, a large amount of
evidence found, and a small number of
wrong accusations will give a high rating.
When your journey ends, you can
have one last go at a Final Accusation. The
suspect's room is searched for clues, and if
you are right your reputation as a

long (You know the feeling?) and you
must get new ones to complete the task.
There is no point in craftily switching off
the volume to save power, because your
score of people whom you have already
got to dance is lost!
There is a map provided, but you had
better memorise the district, because you
are kept too busy to refer to it. You must
avoid being caught by the beat-walking
policeman, and encounters with a very
persistant Tone-deaf Walker are best

ANOTHER CHEAP GAME FROM FIRE-
bird, but is it any good? Well, this game is a
text/graphics adventure and a good one
at that.
You ar e Seafarer Gazette's ac e
reporter, and y ou are i n  a  nuclear
submarine trapped on a sea-bed. The
object is to send a message to GHQ for
help. This may sound like a piece of cake,
but I must emphasise that this is no mean
task.
avoided too, since this  charmer w ill
damage your Blaster! You must then call
in to have it repaired!
The scoring in the game is simple. You
either make it or you don't! This has a
serious effec t o n  t h e  c ontinuing
playability of the game.
The action takes place over the top of a
very accurate representation of a ghetto
blaster, complete with tape hubs turning,
rev c ounter , batter y  a n d  v o lu me
indicator, the lot!
There is a very good demo with music.
The music your machine plays covers ten
different tunes, played very well.
The s ub contains a  number  o f
locations in which you will ﬁnd an object,
or more than one, and a few of these are
useful in your effort to send the message.
There are plenty of them to make it hard
to decide which ones to use.
The graphics are well drawn, and
appear on screen in no time at all.
There is a wide-ranging vocabulary
which can be used to aid your effort to
get help. This vocabulary contains most of
the words which you expect to be able to
use whilst playing your adventure, and a
few more which have only been in the
very best adventures, for example, there is
'Attach', 'Dismantle' and 'Fire'.
I was rather pleased to see that you
could use abbreviations for directions and
All in all I liked this game a lot. It shows
off how very good 3D High-Res Graphics
can be, and uses the sound chip very well.
As a demonstration program to impress
your friends it scores highly. However,
lacking as it does any way in which you
can return to the game again-and-again to
try to beat your previous scores, I have a
feeling i t  will b e  a nine-day-wonder.
Maybe when you get tired of it you can
swap it with a friend!
for obtaining a list of the possessions that
you are carrying, and the ability to save
the state of play at any point, for reloading
later if you failed is a handy addition to
any adventure.
This adventure has some hints and
clues which can be found if you look hard
enough! The vocabulary that is shown in
the instructions you get with the game, is
by no means complete.. .there are plenty
of other words you can use, to get the
result you are looking for.
All in all this is a pleasing adventure to
play. The relatively small playing area
makes it suitable for novice adventurers,
and it even had some humour in it too!
Good value at the price.

Programming the Commodore

WHEN RAY WEST BRINGS OUT A NEW
book , k n o w le d g e a b le  us er s  o f
Commodore machinery at once take an
interest. The reason is not hard to ﬁnd.
The very large sales, and world-wide
accolades poured on "Programming the
Pet/CBM" guarantees curiosity. Has he
once again produced an encyclopaedia
which enables you to relegate all other
reference books to a far corner of the
bookcase? Is the new book really the
"Deﬁnitive guide to the Commodore 64",
as the publishers claim?
Firstly let us see what exactly you
receive for your money. The book runs to
610 pages including the index, and costs
04.90. In addition you can buy a disk or
two tapes containing all the programs
within the book, for 0.40, and £10.40
respectively.
There is a school of thought which
suggests that it is good for your soul, or at
least for your understanding for you to
type in the programs yourself. It is claimed
that you will get a better idea of how the
code operates that way. I would dispute
this. It is quite difﬁcult enough to try to
enter programs in accurately, especially if
they have many DATA statements in
them, without trying to understand them
at the same time. Studying the printed
version of the program in the book is
likely to be much more fruitful. In any
case, most of us want to get cracking
using new facilities, and not to be held
back by tedious typing.
The ﬁr s t t w o  chapters a r e  a n
introduction t o  the book and t o  the
machine.
The Basic Reference Guide follows,

A Lou& Ltd. Publication
which is likely to be the section of the
book most-referred t o  b y  readers.
Introductory material is followed by  a
detailed analysis of every Basic keyword,
Each keyword is  covered in  whatever
degree of detail is necessary. Its Type,
Syntax, Modes , Token, Abbreviated
entry, and Purpose, are all spelt out, and
then a number of examples follows. The
examples are fully annotated, so as to be
understood by beginner and experienced
users alike. A very useful feature is the
cross-referencing to the contents of other
chapters where relevant. This saves much
fruitless searching, and avoids repetitions
in the text. Especially attractive is cross-
referencing t o  machine-code ways of
doing something that is being shown in
Basic. Similarly, the details about LIST
include reference t o  programs which
carry out UNLIST and TRACE. Similarly, if
you are reading about NEW, you are told
where to ﬁnd a piece of code which will

explanatory notes, at the end o f  this
chapter.
Chapter 4  c ov er s  " Ef f e c t iv e
Programming in Basic". This is a highly
welcome facility, usually missing from
books of this type. It covers ﬂowcharting,
System des ign, a n d  ( again usually
neglected), File Structure. The section on
Serious and Less-serious Programming
introduces t h e  id e a s  o f  menus ,
documentation, ease o f  modiﬁcation,
easy data input.
This section draws  attention t o
unusual characteristics of Basic, which
create pitfalls for  the unwary and/or
inexperienced. Speeding-up BASIC is
covered, although I would have preferred
to see a little more detail. However, once

LIBRARY
again cross-referencing to other chapters
comes to your aid.
Chapter 5 covers the architecture of
the 64, a n d  giv es  information o n
programming t h e  Complex Interface
Adapters. I f  you think the CIA is an
intelligence network, then the section on
investigating the CIA's will help to de-
mystify the subject. A section on resetting,
and autostaring leads into a discussion of
commercial software, in cartridge, and on
disc and tape.
The next chapter covers Advanced
Basic. In addition to showing how Basic
and its variables are stored, y ou are
exposed t o  the special locations and
features of Basic. Full details are given of
the operation of the keyboard buffer.
A machine-language program i s
offered for programming Function keys.
You ar e encouraged t o  modify  the
manner in which the 64 operates in a
whole host of ways. You want to make
certain keys repeat if held down? You are
shown.
However, the real meat comes when
the section "Dictionary of Extensions to
BASIC" is reached.
Unlike the book on the PET/CBM,
this volume gives a lot of Basic routines,
and fewer machine-code ones. Three
factors appear to have inﬂuenced this.
Firstly there is the recent publication of a
book of Machine-language Routines by
Mr. West's American publisher, which
gives machine language alternatives,
secondly there is the fact that BASIC
routines are more readily understood,
and thirdly the book could be published
sooner if Basic routines were included,
simply because the debugging time is
reduced!
That said, you are able to Append Basic
program lines , hav e l i n e  numbers
provided automatic ally , r enumber
selected sections of your program, chain
program segmented together, and carry
Out a  whole host o f  other esoteric
activities at will. A variety of sorts is given,
and this is a most valuable chapter.
Chapter 7 brings you into the area of
Machine-Language. " Super mon" is
provided in an Appendix, for those who
do not have a monitor available. The
introduction offer s  s hor t mac hine
language programs to get your feet wet.
Addressing modes are then dealt with,
with admirable clarity, and after  a
description of Op-codes, you are taken
on a guided tour through various useful
machine-language techniques. e.g. two-
byte operation, loops, two's complement
arithmetic, and probably most important
of all, Debugging machine-language
programs. The use o f  monitors, and
assemblers rounds off this chapter.
Next c omes  "Machine-language
methods speciﬁc to the 64. Including the
use of Kernal routines, using both ROM-
routines, and the RAM which is hidden
under ROM, modifying BASIC, Vectors
and Interrupts.
Chapter 9 deals with mixing Machine-
language and BASIC.
Chapter 10 gives the entire Vocabulary
of the 6510 chip, aided and abetted by
helpful notes.
Chapter 11 i s  a  fully  annotated
memory-map for  the 64 and the VIC,
covering the ﬁrst new hundreed RAM
locations, t he BASIC RO M, and t he
KERNAL ROM.
Chapter 12 is
graphics.
This is  a  m in o r  masterpiece o f
condensation. I t  inc ludes  a  cross-
reference table of Key, CHR$ value, POKE
value and a picture of the graphic itself.
Screen scrolling is  covered, as is
character editing, and of course, Sprites.
However, as we might expect the sprite
coverage inc ludes  s uc h ex otic a as
extending of sprites available. (A program
using 32 sprites is given), animation, and
smooth motion.
Sound is given the same thorough
treatment in chapter 13. A very detailed
analysis of the SID chip is followed by a
music theory and music programs. These
are pretty  lengthy, and i f  y ou ar e
interested, they will push you towards
buying the tapes or disc!
Tape storage i s  giv en t h e  f u l l
treatment in the next chapter, including
copy protection (creation not breaking!),.
Disc activities are covered in chapter
15. Useful programs abound. Problems
with disc drives are examined, and the
programs on the disc which comes with
the 1541 Disc drive are looked into.
Changing device number, in  both
software and hardware is covered, Sorted
directories can be printed using one of
the utilities provided. File handling in
Machine-language is covered.
The ﬁnal chapters c ov er  ot her
peripherals including printers, plotters,
joysticks, paddles etc. An example of the
thoroughness of this section shows when
we are told how much an Atari Paddle
varies in use from a Commodore one,and
how to use the RS232 interface.
The book ﬁnishes with 18 Appendices,
covering ASCII codes, Commodore ASCII
codes, 6502/6510 op-codes, Dec/Hex
conversion tables, etc. etc.
There is no doubt that the serious
user of the 64 will ﬁnd this the sort of book
which is referred to again and again, and
in which forgotten or missed material will
be found o n  every reading. Highly
recommended!

SO FAR IN THIS ISSUE YOU WILL HAVE
read about all sorts of clever software and.,
hardware for the creation o f  artistic
masterpieces. For those of you with the
energy to type it in, here is a program
which, whilst n o t  being particularly
sophisticated will enable you to doodle to
your heart's content.
The program operates i n  high
resolution bit map mode and offers the
limitation of two colours per character
space. For convenience, I  will adopt
Uncle Clive's nomenclature of ink and
paint. This does limit the complexity of
the colours you can use, but more
detailed pictures are possible. T h e
program is menu driven with seven
Options. The drawing options offer a
number of operations and for simplicity I
have used a  consistant approach t o
commands. Extensive use o f  border
colour is made to ease matters.
The program is controlled by a joystick
in port 2 only,
The option enables free hand drawing
and manipulation of individual points.
Press ﬁre button to toggle between pen
up and pen down.
Pen down.. .cyan border.. .draws o r
erases.
Pen up.. white border...cursor. moves
without altering picture.
Draw...black cursor.. .press D
Erase.. .red cursor.. .press E
Clear screen.. .press HOME key.
With the pen down, the movement of
the joystick/cursor is drawn or erased.
With speed set at 1 you get a solid line,
with higher speeds you get dotted lines.
Speed
Changes speed of travel. You can choose
from 1 to 9 pixels per step.
Lines
Initial border is dark blue (command
mode). In this mode you can move the
cursor and perform other commands.
Erase/draw and clear screen as for
draw mode. There is no need for pen up,
so I've omitted it.
To draw a line:
1. Move cursor to one end of the line and
press Fire once. The border will go light
blue. A dot is drawn to show the end of
the line.
2. Move cursor to other end and press
Fire. The line will be drawn.
Circles
Command mode has a black border. All
commands are used as for Li nes. To draw a
circle:
1. Place the cursor at centre point and
press Fire. The border will turn one shade
lighter, and the centre will be marked.
2. Move the cursor to the point where the
circle will cross the horizontal axis due
east from the centre. Press Fire. The
border will turn one shade lighter, and
the point will be marked.
3. Move the cursor to the point where the
circle will cross the Y axis, ie due north of
the centre. Press Fire, and the circle will
be draw. The centre dot is then erased.
Using this routine any shape of ellipse can
be drawn.
Air Brush
Yellow border.
This command allows you to shade areas
with dots. The command ﬁlls a square
area, with the cursor at its top left corner,
with a number of random dots. Two box
sizes are available, 16 by 16 and 8 by 8
pixels. Draw/erase work as before.
To draw with the brush, press ﬁre. To
move the cursor without drawing release
ﬁre.
Brush Parameters
This enables you to specify how many dots
per squirt (1 to 255) and to choose the size
of spray area.
Colours
This allows you to redeﬁne the ink and
paper colours. All drawing actions update
the area concerned with the current
colour. Careful use of erase in draw mode
will allow you to paint areas of paper.
To enter status mode press F2 when in
any drawing mode. To exit speed, brush
parameters status and colour options,
press any key. To return to main menu
from a drawing mode, press El.

Old square eyes Phil South is
back with more games and a
few high scores.
A MO NT H OVER ALREADY? ( O R
blimey, don't lime ﬂy when you're 'avin'
fun. Still, off w e go! In  this months
packed column we've got lots of what can
only be described as "stuff"; a squint at
new games, readers letters, hi-scores and
comment, all bound up in the deathless
prose you've come to know and love.
Oh yes, wait a minute Mr
postman...
Last month I  got a letter from David
Edwards of Carlisle asking abot M.U.L.E.
and Archon (Ariolasoft), as to whether
they were any good, well, yes they are.
Archon is a cross between a shoot 'em-
up, Dungeons & Dragons and Chess. It is
totally !riff, but I highly recommend that
you play against a Human player, rather
than against the computer, because on
the Combat screens (the shooty bit) the
computer will beat you every time, by
virtue of the fact it doesn't have to use a
joystick. (Fiendishly clever these
computers!)
M.U.L.E. is a strategy game which by
rights ought to be very boring. But it isn't!
In places, i t  even manages t o  b e
educational! (Streuth!) You are a little
bongley looking alien (you even get to
choose what colour you are) who is put on
a planet to try and grow and sell crops;
you are i n  competition with three
opponents. The name of the game is
buying, selling and bidding and generally
managing funds. (A handy skill, which
everyone needs. Just ask m y  bank
manager.) with the help of your friendly
robot mule. Terriﬁc fun and a  real
challenge.
This brings me to a good point. I
reckon that arcade games are ﬁnally
coming of age. Arcade/Strategy involves
thinking. If you have to use your head,
you won't turn into a brainless moron,
whose onl expression of a creative act is
to blast a pretty coloured sprite into a
zillion sparkling pixels. I  mean REAL
strategy, not the phoney strategy of a
game like Raid o n  Bungeling Bay
(Ariolosoft), which impresses the strategic
advantage t o  b e  gained b y blasting
everything that moves out of the water (a
tactic favoured by US Generals). No, I
mean winning a game byskill of the brain,
rather than JUST reﬂexes. Software
houses take note!
Sneaky peeks of the last four
weeks
From time to time, I get to see new US
games. Sooner o r  later, these little
nuggets will ﬁnd their way into English
shops, so here is my ﬁrst Transatlantic
Preview.
One to look ot for is Henry's House. I
didn't catch the name of the software
house, but look out for it anyway: it's a
platform game, with it's roots ﬁrmly
burrowe&into Manic Miner. (There is
even a guest appearance by the rolling pin
waving chefs!) It's got the most amazing
graphics; makes the 64 perform like a
souped-up Atari!
Survivor is the most aptly named shoot-
'em-up I've ever played! At ﬁrst it's not
apparent what the point is, just spinning
around in space in a little round spaceship
that ﬁres back and front simultaneously.
You score for everything you hit (and
there's lots to hit), but the trick is to stay
alive. Metorites and bug-eyed monsters
are out to get you while you're blasting at
lasercannon protected fortresses. Believe
me. it's difﬁcult. The ship has inertia, soil's
easy to lose control and if you bump into
anything at all, Baboom I My best try on
this game got me 6080: draw your own
conclusions. Watch out for Survivor, it's
fantastic!
Faves from the rave
Games I've been playing this month:
Drelbs (Synsoft/US GOLD) a really zippy
strategy game
Cavelon II (Jetsoft) a  medieval Manic
Miner clone HI SCORE 22900
Chuckie Egg (A&F) a  sort o f  Manic
Chicken HI SCORE 17480
Toy Bizzare (Activision) yet  another
platform format 20800
Boulder Dash (First Star) the only Dig
game I can bear HI SCORE 13089
I've forsaken C A D  C A M Warrior
(Taskset) in favour of Boulder Dash as the
game I play every day. There is always one
favourite game that absorbs me more
than all others, and it changes from time
to time. This set me to thinking; why don't
you write in and tell me why you like it so
much! Let's hear from you. This is YOUR
page as much as it is mine, so pen me a
note, drop me a line, send me a card, ﬂy
me a carrier pidgeon...
By far the most surprisingly brilliant
thing I've seen lately is The Rocky Horror
Show (CRL). It is the most original and
absorbing video game I've seen in a very
long time. The graphics are ﬁrst class, the
action amusing and highly challenging
(watch out for the entrance to the Lab!)
but it's the music that really knocks
everything into a cocked hat. Watch for
my full playtest in a near future issue.
Not wishing to come on like your
social secretary or something, but if you
never saw the Rocky Horrow Show the
ﬁrst time around, you're in  luck. A
fantastic new production of the show is
currently doing a  coiuntry-wide tour.
Write to the theatre company HQ at the
Threatre Royale. Henley, for details.
Have you got elite, boy!
Elite 64 (Firebird), contrary to what other
mags would have you believe, is not
ﬁnished yet. But very soon (my inside
sources say) the best reason for buying a
Beeb will be on the 64! Thank goodness
for that. I thought I was going to have to
trade in for a Beeb, just to play this game.
It really is VERY good, I  really can't
recommend it highly enough; a kind of
mega-arcade/strategy all in 3D with great
sound. You buy and sell (or shoot) your
way to Elite Class in this galaxy of the
future. If you've never seen this game, or
haven't heard of it,or don't want a copy of
your very own, then you must be an
ostritch. (Put this magazine down, and get
back to the Zoo, at once! Shoo!)
And now, the end is near...
-.and so I face the ﬁnal curtain. That's all
of this month's helping of stuff. See you in
four weeks, when we will be making a
modem out of plastic squeezy bottles,
collecting bone buttons out of rashers of
bacon and.. oh yeah, we might look at a
few arcade games and your letters too!
Be seeing you!

Brendin Lewis takes a
discerning look at some411111
graphics packages that a r e .
available.
Gas Kit 64
4
11
THERE ARE A  GREAT NUMBER O F
graphics packages available for the C64,
maybe this is a reﬂection on the difﬁculty
of accessing the graphics capabilities
directly. Four such packages are covered
here, some good, some not so good.
These a r e  n o t  a ll s imply  graphics
packages, some offer sound, animation
and sprite f a c i l i t i e s . /
Gas Kit 64 from Anirog is a general
purpose utility  package which offers
graphics, animation and sound. Control
of the various aspects of the package can
be controlled either interactively or via
program control. Again, the software
relies upon the keyboard for almost all
command input, rather than by the use of
onscreen menu selection by the joystick.
The only difference here is that to draw
lines, the key must be held down as well as
moving the joystick. User friendliness
does not c ome high o n  t he lis t o f
priorities with this one.
Artkit is the graphics section of the
package, though it offers virtually none of
the facilities one would expect from a
graphics package. Basically you can draw
lines with a pencil (small cursor) or a brush
(big cursor). Limited line drawing is also
E
copy, zoom, mirror, move, or any shapes
except circle. As mentioned, there are
only two brush sizes. The manual states
that you can draw any picture you like.
The thing is, you're going to have to be
very patient, as it will take quite a while, It
is also possible to deﬁne sprites with
Artkit, but that b it  really isn't worth
mentioning.
The next section is called Composer,
this section from its name obviously deals
with sound. From the demo which can be
run from the main menu, quite good
sound effects are possible. Because you
expect to play music with your hands, this
package is  far easier t o  use than its
brother. You actually have to play the
tune you want with the normal keys,
which are shown on the screen in piano
format. You can choose one or two out of
ten instrument sounds at various pitches.
When you've decided what you want to
play and gone through the above steps,
-
-
faster, or much faster than. the original
way it was played by you.
If and when you are ﬁnally satisﬁed
with your masterpiece, various methods
of storage and manipulation are available
to you. You can store your ditty w hat 's
called replay memory, fetch from replay
memory, append to the tune in replay
memory and load or save with the disc.
As w e l l  a s  us ing t h e  utilities
interactively, as mentioned, they can also
be used from within BASIC programs by
means of commands. In all there are 26
BASIC extension commands which allow
you to do everything mentioned above.
In this form, even the graphics section can
be made use of, though the sound
sections are pretty good anyway.
Scope
Unlike the other packages, this one is
subtitled 'games designer'. When loaded,
it moves itself up into high memory. It is
from here that its routines are called by
BASIC via embedded commands in REM
statements. There are 46 new commands
in all, which deal with colour, sound,
music and graphics. Scope can only
handle integer numbers, most of which
are single byte values (0 to 255) but it is
possible to use double byte words thus
extending the range to 0 to 65535. Scope is
actually a  compiler, all words are
compiled into machine code, and once
compiled Scope need no longer remain in
memory. The use of Scope itself does rely
on a working knowledge of BASIC.

p
As mentioned, Scope adds 46 BASIC
extension commands, what follows is a
brief explanation of some of the more
useful commands. SCR allows scrolling of
the screen in all four directions. SPRTS
allows s et u p  o f  t h e  number  and
colour o f  sprites. HWAVE sets u p  a
waveform. MUSIC instructs the sound
generator to play a tune. The manual
covers all the commands in detail. It also
gives many example programs for the user
to access the compiler commands.
As well as the Scope compiler, the
cassette also contains a number of demo
programs. These are loaded from the tape
then compiled and run. Both the compile
and run commands are actually SYS calls.
The demos themselves do quite a good
job of showing the facilities of Scope.
What they do not is show that the package
lives up to its boast of games designer.
As ever, t h e  package contains a
number of demo screens and these were
of a similar standard to the rest of the
package. It seems that very little effort has
been put into this, though nearly all the
usual facilities are available, they are all of
such low standard. I very rarely criticise
software in this manner, but the best thing
about this system was the goodbye option
on the menu; even then, it had the cheek
to ask me if I was sure I wanted to leave the
program!
Doodle
This is another package heavily reliant on
the keyboard, even though it is designed
for use with a  joystick or  trackerball.
Unlike some of its rivals it also does not
use ic ons  a n d  windows  f o r  menu
selection, This seems a shame because,
even though icon is one of the latest
buzzwords, they do actually make things
much easier to use in most cases, and most
deﬁnitely with this type of package.
This is actually the third package I've
looked at and so far the various methods
of drawing lines etc  have a ll been
different. This is  probably t he most
difﬁcult to get used to. Actually, it seems
that even with practice, mistakes will still
be made, particularly when line drawing.
On the other hand, the ﬁll is excellent if
you don't use the small brush sizes. If you
do, the ﬁll colour leaks out and ﬁlls the
whole screen.
One of the main drawbacks for me
when testing this product was that I didn't
have a trackerball available. If I had done
then I wouldn't have had to rely on the
joystick for cursor positioning. Drawing
straight vertical and horizontal lines is
great but anything else becomes very time
consuming as you need to make the pen
speed very slow. The one advantage of
using the joystick is that you don't get line
breakup when in sketch mode as you do
with the mouse and the touchpad (see
other graphics feature).
As with the previous packages, this
one contains a disc and printer input/
output section allowing the user to load
and save pictures tor doodles as Quick-
silva call them) and also dump screens to a
printer. The demo screens were of a high
quality, I congratulate the person who
actually drew them, it must have taken
some time; assuming o f  course that
Doodle was used to draw them.
Activity centre
Of all the packages reviewed, this was the
ﬁrst that offered mor e than simply
graphics and/or sprite editing. This offers
a music option whereby the user can
design their own tunes, Also, the ﬁles
here are called pages rather than screens,
implying t h a t  s ome f o r m  o f  t e x t
processing can also be done. As a bonus, it
is also possible to produce animation. I
was a little dubious when I read this part
but read on and all will be revealed.
Activity centre is  a  misnomer, i t
should really be called Inactivity Centre.
Everything is so slow, whether it be line,
circle or ﬁll. When I  say ﬁll, don't be
misled, this version of ﬁll simply allows
you to deﬁne a rectangle to be ﬁlled,
ﬁlling any complicated shape could and
probably would take all day.
The only similarity I've found with
some of the other packages is that you rely
on t h e  keyboard f o r  mos t o f  t h e
command input. I t  does theoretically
offer additional features, these being
animation and music. Animation allows
you t o  deﬁne t w o  shapes that w ill
alternate while moving. The music section
is probably the best of the three, and this
isn't wonderful by any means. It allows
you t o deﬁne notes from the musical
scale, vary their length and let them be
sharp or ﬂat. Once you've done this, the
tune can be played and modiﬁed. Various
pre-deﬁned instrument s ounds ar e
available to increase the scope of what
really is a limited utility.

Get to grips with Commodore
graphics with this range of
hardware reviewed by
Brendin Lewis.
WITH T HE WIDE SPREAD USE O F
microcomputers with high resolution
graphics, i t  seems reasonable f o r a
number o f  companiei t o  produce
hardware to make things a little easier to
use. This article covers four such items of
hardware: two lightpens, a touchpad, and
an electronic mouse. All these hardware
packages contain some form of software
so this is covered also.
Magic mouse
Though not the ﬁrst mouse I've used, this
is the ﬁrst that I've encountered for the
C64. The immediate impression one gets
when the mouse is unpacked is that it's
more of a rat than a mouse. The size of the
Magic mouse is rather larger than that of
the Apple Macintosh or the one supplied
by Microsoft.
Other than its size, the mouse is well
constructed. The electronic mouse got its
name because of its shape and the fact
that the cable came from the back like a
tail. Using this analogy, this poor beast has
a tail growing out of its ear. Sarcastic
remarks aside, the mouse ﬁts quite
comfortably in the hand and has three
coloured control buttons on the front.
Underneath is the ball and ball housing,
the ball bearing in this case has got a
plastic coating. I can see no advantage
in this as it just seems to gather more dirt
than the normal type. The other thing that
is different to the norm are the two
positioning screws. These are used to
ensure correct positioning of the mouse
cursor on the screen; the problem is that
they don't - the cursor still goes well off
screen.
Along with the mouse come four
software packages: a  hi-res graphics
The Koala Pad is an excellent graphks aid
GRAPHICS
HARDWARE
designer, and both sprite and icon
designers. The ﬁnal piece of software is
not really a package, it is the control
software to let you build mouse routines
into your own software. Of the three
packages, the hi-res designer is the most
interesting. It allows the user to draw
lines, circles, ﬁll shapes, change
foreground and background colours etc.
The package itself is fun to use, though
there are some faults. Exact positioning of
the mouse is difﬁcult thus joining lines for
ﬁlling is a little hit and miss.
Filling shapes has always fascinated
me, so one of the ﬁrst things I did was to
draw the most complicated shape I could
think of. Filling the inside of this shape
was a marvel to watch. Although slow, it
did do a perfect ﬁll. Problems do arise if
you get lots of colours on the screen at the
same time and then try a ﬁll. The result is
very similar to the effect on the Spectrum
where colours go into a stair pattern. This
is due to the fact that the 64 will not allow
more than three colours to occupy the
same block of 4*8 pixels at the same time.
All that is required is a little care when
choosing colours that are to be next to
each other.
The icon and sprite designers are very
similar in operation, with the same screen
layout. Positioning the mouse is not so
much of a problem in this case as the
cursor always goes to the nearest point on
the enlarged pixel layout. All three
packages were well designed and easy to
use.
The Koala Pad
The Koala pad is a touch-sensitive pad,
and a  peripheral not often seen on
micros, as they are normally only found
on expensive computer aided design
(CAD) systems. They offer, as does this
one, a big advantage to the user over
joysticks, lightpens and mice. This is that
the user actually draws on a ﬂat horizontal
surface, in much the same way as with
paper and pen. The mouse is the only
thing that comes close, but the unnatural
feel takes some getting used to.
As with all the peripherals in this
article, the touch pad includes a graphics
package. This is quite similar to that of the
mouse, b u t  o f  a  higher quality.
Positioning of the cursor on the screen is
much easier as only the hand and eye are
used as opposed to the hand, eye and
mechanics of the other devices. In fact
you can actually trace the image with your
ﬁnger or with a purpose-built stylus.
The graphics features include line,
box, circle, rays, as does the mouse
software. Additional features available are
mirror imaging, where anything drawn is
mirrored in the other three corners of the

1
1
screen. Zoom, where a portion of the
screen is enlarged for ﬁne work. Copying
and swapping o f  various parts of the
screen to another. An option called oops
which negates the operation performed
by the previous command.
Finally, shaded colours are available,
where the normal colour is cross hatched
with the current background colour.
There are actually two graphics screens
available and the command swap allows
the user to alternate between the two.
The other command that utilises both
screens is the copy command. This allows
you to copy a portion of one screen to the
other and vice versa. Thus when using the
demos, there is one called VAN which is
the shell of a motor van. There is also
another which contains all the accessories
for the van like wheels etc. By loading
both these frames, one into each graphic
screen the whole picture can be made up
by moving parts of one to the other.
Although ﬁll., circle, line and multiple
lines are pretty standard, this software
does make a rather good job of them. Line
and multiple line us e rubber band
techniques, so that the line can be seen
before it is drawn. The ﬁll is far more
efﬁcient and a lot quicker than that with
the mouse software. When circles are
deﬁned they can be moved to any part of
the screen before drawing commences.
transistor to detect the light. Also, some
form of switch is required so that the pen
is only active when required. This switch
can take the form of an actual switch built
into the pen, touch sensitive contacts on
the pen,or,as in this case, can be switched
by one or  more of  the keys o n the
keyboard. The keyboard method is the
most inconvenient of  the three, as it
requires both hands to operate.
'The Ed umate pen is attractively styled,
with a thin burgundy pen and coiled lead.
Contained in the package as well as the
pen is  the Peripheral Vision graphics
package; designed for the pen by the
same manufacturers. The package itself
contains all the usual features plus a few of
its own.
One of the most interesting features is
the textures. For those of you who have
seen the Macpaint package for the Apple
Macintosh, you will have already seen this
feature. Simply, instead of only being able
to draw, paint and ﬁll in onlyone colour
you are able t o paint with u p  t o 35
textures. These are two colour patterns of
cross hatching, bars and stripes etc and
are excellent for ﬁlling and painting. They
do cause a problem when in thin line
mode, they cause strange dotted rather
than solid lines Thus, when using this
mode, it is wise to use the more usual solid
colours in the normal way.
The magic mouse is extremely well constructed
Another n i c e  f e a t u r e  i s  t h e
input/output section of the software, this
allows the swap over between disc and
tape, initialisation of discs plus the loading
and saving of picture ﬁles. A number of
demonstration picture ﬁles are supplied
on the disc all of which are high quality,
but my  heavy handed drawing soon
destroys their good looks. One thing to
look out for is the picture called Eyefull;
striking is the only way to describe it.
Overall this system is a joy to use, the
graphics package fast and clear, the Koala
pad was simplicity itself in use though my
only criticism might be that the actual
touch surface could have been slightly
bigger. Excellent.
The Edumate lightpen
The lightpen has always been a popular
peripheral for use with graphics packages,
mainly d u e  t o  it s  cheapness a n d
versatility. Various types are available,
though all operate on basically the same
principle. All use some form of photo-
One option whic h is  different t o
the others is the ﬁll mode, this package
checks to see if the shape is closed before
it attempts to ﬁll it. If it isn't then it brieﬂy
points to the place where the gap is so that
it can be repaired before retrying.
Unlike some of the packages, all
options are selected on the screen, this
makes it all the more a shame that there is
no switch on the pen itself. This very
minor problem aside, the pen is quite
accurate, if rather slow when drawing.
There is an option on the menu which
offers a trade off between speed and
accuracy. This is subdivided into ﬁve steps
between accurate but slow to fast but not
so accurate. A very useful feature but
possibly ﬁve steps are too many, I only
used the fastest and the slowest.
The demo software that comes with
the pen is not part of the main graphics
package. Four programs are provided; a
draw routine, a disc utility, a 3D tic-tac-toe
game and pen music. The draw routine is
similar to the draw section of the main
graphics package and is nothing special.
The disc utility allows you to access the
disc for a directory or to run programs.
The game is slow and easy to beat, but
difﬁculty isn't its  purpose. Pen music
allows you to play notes printed on the
screen by touching the pen to them.
Data lightpen
As mentioned previously, all light pens
work on roughly the same principle this
one though offers one major advantage.
Unlike most lightpens, which react to all
types of light, this one is tuned so that it
only reacts to the high frequency light
signals that are produced by televisions
and monitors. This is difﬁcult to prove, but
the pen does have an LED (light emitting
diode) mounted into its case which does
come on when held up to the TV screen
but is normally not lit. Also, unlike the
Edumate pen, this one has a switch
mounted into its case.
There is also one major difference
between this package and the others. The
whole thing is  designed as a  budget
system, there are no ﬂashy boxes and
manuals with this one. Even the hole for
the LED looks as though it's been gouged
out with a knife. The one thing that must
be remembered is that even though it
doesn't lo o k  lik e  muc h, i t  doesn't
therefore mean that the product itself is
going to be poor. In fact the pen itself is
very comfortable to use, and it's a shame
that there is not more software available
for use with it.
The software that does come with the
pen is pretty basic, the ﬁrst is an intro
package which lets you know what the
pen is and how it works. This is done by
displaying the status of the LED, the status
of the switch, and the coordinates of the
pen on the screen. Finally, it lets you drag
eight different coloured sprites around
the screen, just for fun.
The second program on the tape is
called Colour draw and is not up to much;
drawing is limited to the large, cursor
sized blocks. The accuracy of the pen is
poor here, with the cursor being about
three blocks away from the pen. Also the
response to the button is very slow.
The ﬁnal pr ogr am i s  t h e  h ig h
resolution drawing package. I was quite
looking forward to trying this one after
seeing t h e  accuracy o f  the previous
software. T h e  software offers  t h e
following drawing modes; line, dot,
turtle, continuous, a n d  erase. T he
problem was that only dot mode could be
accessed and this was widely inaccurate.
From the instructions, it should have been
possible to swap modes by using the pen,
no chance. As you will have gathered, the 
E
demo software provided with the pen was
not of a high standard. The important
thing here though, is that all the pen
control routines are available to the user
for t h e m  t o  build in t o  their  o w n
programs.

Anagram Sales
IT IS A NICE CHANGE TO HAVE SOME
really good software t o  write about,
especially software which can prove that
the 64 is a machine which really can be
useful to the business man.
Anagram is  a  name that has been
about for almost as long as Commodore.
It has produced software for most of the
Commodore range and i f  you ﬁnd a
Commodore p e t  r unning business
software there is a good chance that it wil
have Anagram programs.
I ﬁrs t us ed Anagrams sales and
purchase ledgers before I got hooked on
computers. That was on a Pet. When I
loaded this sales ledger it was like running
the same program. It has been improved
of course but the style was the same. Easy
to use and hard to mess up. Why change a
successful formula.
Sales Ledger
The mechanics of all sales ledgers are
essentially the same. Running a ledger can
appear very easy or nearly impossible.
Anagram make it almost as easy as it could
be for a non-bookkeeper. It would still
help things if you read a book such as
BOOKKEEPING MADE SIMPLE but it is by
no means vital. The Anagram manuals are
easy to read and go through the whole
process step by step.
Capacity
If you are thinking of running a sales
ledger the ﬁrst thing you must be very
careful and realistic about is capacity. On
more than one occasion I  have seen
people stuck b y  underestimating the
number of accounts they have or the
number o f  outstanding invoices t he
average account has. Look into the future,
think about expansion and prepare.
As a guideline Anagram offer realistic
and accurate maximums. 220 customers
with 1 3  invoices outstanding (max)
without settlement discounts.
220 customers with 8 invoices outstanding
(max) with settlement discounts.
110 c us tomer s  w i t h  2 5  inv oic es
outstanding (max) without settlement
discounts.
110 c us tomer s  w i t h  1 6  inv oic es
outstanding (max) w it h  s ettlement
discounts.
This should be adequate for many
businesses.
To quote the manual. Trade discounts,
either line by  line and/or across the
invoice as a whole, are allowed for and
provision is  also made for  settlement
discounts. An invoice may be of up to 20
lines. Cash i s  pos ted t o  customer
accounts, a n d  a  suspense account
provides for cash which is received but
cannot be allocated. The reason I have
quoted the manual on that is because they
have described it in the best way possible.

obtainable are

There is little that can be said about
sales ledgers without wafﬂeing on about
what they should do and where they
should be used, Anagram Sales Ledger is a
very good program and very professional.
It has been used successfully on the 64
by many businesses and has a pedigree
that few other programs can claim.
I have looked long and hard at many
sales legers in  order t o  operate one
myself. I now use this one. It has not let me
down, And certainly makes my accounts
intelligable to the accountant and I think
will pay for itself.
Good one Anagram.
Electronic Files
PH FILE is a database program. Not in the
same league as Superbase or Vizastar, but
not as simple as the Gemini type. It falls
midway between both. I tell a lie. It only
falls between the two with the addition of
PH REPORT but more on that later,
Create
PFS FILE allows you to create a card index
type record by moving the cursor around
the screen while typing in ﬁeld headings.
An unusual feature of this is that each
'card' can contain up to 32 'cards'. For
those with verbal diarrhoea this should
allow them to squeeze everything in.
Once your card is designed you can
save the template ready for ﬁlling in.
Because o f  t h e  structure o f  t h e
program and its use of ramdom ﬁling it is
only possible t o  hav e o n e  created
database per disc.
Depending on what you want the ﬁle
for this could be either good or bad. I ﬁnd
that 1 ﬁle per disc saves confusion.
Forget a ﬁeld?
If after using your ﬁle for a while you
decide you need to add an extra ﬁeld or
somehow make slight modiﬁcations to
the ﬁle this is quite simply done providing
you have used less than 50% of the disc.
This is a nice touch as it is often only after
some use that you ﬁnd you need an extra
ﬁeld for the odd comment.
I was quite disappointed to ﬁnd that
ﬁles created by PFS ﬁle could not be
transported to wordprocessors. At least if
they can be it was not in the book. This is a
delinate restriction as I ﬁnd that one of my
most common uses for a database is to
create a mailing list,
Hardcopy
To printout the information you have in
your database you can design a print
template. You can choose which ﬁelds are
to be printed and they can be printed with
or without the heading. You can only
print out ﬁelds in the order in which they
appear on the ﬁle, although in most cases
this is not an inconvenience.
Searches can be made on either the
keyﬁeld or each ﬁeld. The manual says
that searches on the keyﬁeld take about 5
seconds. I found that a little optimistic but
on the whole times were reasonably
quick. Searches on the main body of the
ﬁle was a very different story and seemed
to take forever.
Records can be sorted on any ﬁeld and
can also be printed according to the sort.
Pfs report
Then c ame PFS REPORT. I t s  sister
program. This claims to be the piece of
software that makes PFS FILE complete. In
my opinion this is the piece of software
that was missing in the ﬁrstplace and
should hav e been par t o f  t h e  ﬁrst
program.
At its simplest PFS REPORT allows
more versatility in printing out your ﬁles.
Quite complex designs can be built up
even tabular reports can be printed.
The main beneﬁt though with PFS
REPORT is  its  facilities t o  calculate.
Running totals can be kept and printed
midform throughout a print run. This is
particularly useful with ﬁle such as stock
cards and records of payments/recipts.
Close encounter of a similar
kind
Its style is the same as PFS REPORTS and so
learning to use it is easy.
Comprehensive research a n d  s ort
facilities are provided once again and
-
adequately explained in the manual. This
program is the one that turns the database
from a  static database t o  a  s emi-
programmable database.
Big moans
If while y ou ar e using y our  report
program you -feel you need to add a card.
Tough. Turn off. Load PFS FILE. Add re-
cord. Turn off. Load PFS REPORT. Carry
on with what you were doing. In practice
it is as tedious as it sounds. There could at
least have been an option to load the
other program from within its opposite
number. A grave ommison and one which
would have made it far more versatile.
How do they rate?
On the whole then not so good. Very
professionally presented and would have
seemed very good if it had been released
about six months after the 64 was released
but now gives the impression of being a
little dated and tired.
5 out of 10

In the second and ﬁnal part
of our series, David Janda
looks at some more
extensions for your 64.
THIS M O N T H  I ' V E  LO O KED  A T
another four Basic extensions for the C64.
Just like last month, the variety and quality
is mixed, with each package offering its
good and sometimes very bad points.
Each review focuses on one particular
aspect of the package which stands out,
and a table listing another area of interest
can also be found.
Superbasic
This package from Interceptor Micro's is
rather unsusual It offers the programmer
72 commands and functions, many of
which are unique to Superbasic, yet it
lacks features you would expect from a
Basic extension.
Superbasic is supplied on tape or disc
with a 39 page manual and demonstration
program. For the purpose of this review I
used the tape version.
The commands and functions cover
graphics, sound, programming aiods,
sprites, I/O, numeric and string functions,
memory manipulation a n d  s c reen
control. T h e  syntax us ed f o r  eac h
command i s  s imple a n d  eas y  t o
remember, and getting to grips with the
package was very easy.
As mentioned, the package is a little
unusual and I ' ll concentrate o n  t he
graphics commands to illustrate this (see
table 1). Worthy of particular note are the
SHAPE and DRAW commands. SHAPE is
used to specify a pre-deﬁned shape which
is deﬁned in by a string of digits. Each digit
performs a different action, and this is
best illustrated with an example.
SHAPE 40, 35,1, 10, "1357"
This will draw a square at position 40,35 in
white (colour 1). Each side of the shape
will be 10 pixels in length, and the shape
itself is deﬁned by the string 1357. One
will draw up, threee will draw right,ﬁve to
the left and so on.
The DRAW command is also pretty
useful. Unlike many Basic extensions that
require two sets o f  co-ordinates in a
DRAW statement, Superbasic simply
requires one. The result is that a line will
be drawn from the last graphics origin.
The origin can be moved by one of the
graphic commands or invisibly by using
the MOVE command.
What is not so useful is the co-ordinate
system used by Superbasic. Unlike the
majority of packages which specify the
BASIC
EXTENSIONS
column then the row, Sperbasic reverses
this, and this can be confusing!
Simon's BASIC
This is the package that probably set off
the trend in Basic Extensions for the 64.
Simons' Basic was written by thirteen year
old David Simon. Commodore was so
impressed with the efforts of this young
man, that it was marketed by the company
in cartridge form.
Since the ﬁrst version, Simons' Basic
has h a d  a  f e w  modiﬁcations a n d
buggettes removed, but it is basically the
same. Unlike most extensions the 114
commands emphasise programming aids
(see table 2) and structured programming
rather than graphics. Graphic, sound and
sprite commands are i ncorporated, and in
a very good manner, but the structured
programming side is worth looking at
here.
The IF.. .THEN.. ELSE construct is
=

1
implemented a n d  expands o n  t h e
IF. .THEN by allowing program ﬂow to
branch to a second instruction if the IF test
is false. Unlik e standard Basic, i t  is
necessary to precede and follow the ELSE
with a colon.
RCOMP i s  o n e  o f  t h e  'weir d'
commands contained in Simons' Basic. Its
function i s  t o  re-execute t h e  tes t
condition of the last IF. .THEN. .ELSE. The
example in the manual best illustrates
this:
10 INPUT A
20 IF A=10 THEN PRINT "HELLO"; :ELSE:
"BYE";
30 RCOMP: PRINT "MIKE"; :ELSE: PRINT
"STRANGER";
40 RCOMP: PRINT "WELCOME" : ELSE:
PRINT "SEE YOU AGAIN I HOPE"
50 GOTO 10
Not a command that you're going to use
every day!
Two new loop structures have been
added, namely  REPEAT. ,UNTIL and
LOOP. ,EXIT I F .  .END LO O P. T h e
REPEAT. .UNTIL construct (which is part
of the Pascal programming language) will
cause a block of lines to be repeated until
a condition is met. The second type of
loop is similar except it allows more than
one exit condition to be placed anywhere
within the program block. Very handy,
but not very structured!
Finally, a  f o r m  o f  procedure i s
included. A Simons' Basic procedure is a
group of lines enclosed by a PROC name
and END PROC. The named procedure
can be executed by using CALL name,
which will jump to the procedure (a la
GOTO), or  by EXEC name, which will
return control t o the next l i n e  (a la
GOSUB). Simons' Basic doesn't cater for
parameter passing, which is a pity, as it
does have a crude implementation of
local and global variables.
Breden's Basic
This package is  v ery  professionally
presented in a metal-ring binder and an
excellent 160 page cross-referenced
manual. The software itself is available on
tape, disc or cartridge, and contains over
130 commands and functions. The areas
covered include; sprites, graphics, sound,
I/O, n u m e r i c ,  e r r o r  t r a p p i n g ,
programming aids and so on.
The package is quite complex to use
and I  wouldn't recommend i t  t o  a
beginner. Unfortunately, the syntax used
For the commands is quite short, and thus
makes remembering the commands and
functions a little difﬁcult.
The main feature of this package is the
graphics/sprite handling -  almos t
everything y ou could need is  there.
Breden's Basic does  inc lude other
interesting f eat ur es  s u c h  a s  a
comprehensive s et o f  mathematical
functions (see table 3).
Eleven sprite commands allow for the
deﬁnition and manipulation of sprites. A
sprite shape in Breden's Basic is deﬁned
with the MOBSLOT command which
stores the shape of a MOB into one of the
16 slots. There are no special utilities to
facilitate sprite design, and users are
referred to the sprite editor from Visions!
It is possible to enable, disable, set
colour, expand and alter priority of a
MOB with individual commands. It is also
possible to do the same thing with just
one command -  SETM013. This has 10
parameters, and if used correctly can save
on program space.

Video Basic-64 is by far the best Basic
Extension I have used on the C64. The
reasons for this are numerous, but take it
from me, it is a very professional package!
The whole of Video Basic-64 is geared
towards graphics i n  a  big way. The
package only offers about 50 commands,
but the way they are implemented makes
them very powerful.
The average Basic extension w ill

performs. Video Basic-64 differs insofar as
each c ommand performs a  us eful,
effective process. What's mor e, t h e
majority of commands can be used in a
simple or more complex manner, it all
depends on the number of parameters
you wish to specify.
As mentioned, Video Basic-64 is
geared tow ar ds  c r eating gr aphic
programs. The program wedges itself into
Basic thus  allowing t h e  'ordinary '
Commodore Basic to be incorporated
within the source code. I say source code
because it is possible to produce a stand-
alone program that uses Video Basic
commands without having the compiler
in memory!
The package is divided into a number
of sections, each of which contains a
number of commands, some of these are
described below.
Both the high-res and multi colour
modes are supported as well as the
normal text mode. Screens of both modes
(an be loaded or saved to tape or disc.
The DRAW, BOX, DOT and CIRCLE
commands are the primary commands
used for producing graphics, Each can be
followed by several parameters which can
set colour, plot type (invert, unplot etc.)
and s o on. A  very versatile BLOCK
command can be used to ﬁll an area with
colour or with a deﬁned pattern.
Sprite deﬁnition and management is
quite ﬂexible. A  sprite shape can be
deﬁned i n  b i n a r y ,  d e c im a l o r
hexadecimal. ROTATE allows a sprite to
be rotated by 90 within its slot, but besides
these, and a few others, there are no fancy
movement commands.
The package also incorporates turtle
graphics, game control features, a n
extensive range of sound commands and
some v e r y  s ophis tic ated memor y
management commands that allow areas
of screens to be swapped, inverted and so
on.
Summary
Of the eight Basic extensions reviewed in
this series, there isn't one that I could say
"go out and get". The reason for this is
simple. Even though the majority orBasic
extensions include a  common set of
commands, they do tend to offer features
for a particular type of user.
It is hoped that you will have gained a
better understanding o f  what a  Basic
extension package can and cannot offer.

few more handy

IT IS PROBABLY NO  EXAG-
geration to say that more time
has been devoted to devising
efﬁcient sorting methods than
to any other single problem in
computing -  t h is i s  n o t
surprising in view of the fact
that sorting methods are so
important, particularly i n
commercial programming.
In general terms, the sorts
that are quick and easy to code
such as the (infamous) 'bubble
sort' take a fairly long time to
execute whilst t h e  m o re
efﬁcient so rt s, su ch  a s
SHELLSORT and QUICKSORT
achieve their speed by utilising
much m o re  complex a l -
gorithms,
In this article, I present two
sorts - the ﬁrst in BASIC and the
second in machine code. They
are both based upon t h e
SHELLSORT method which is a
reasonable compromise
between speed an d  com-
plexity. However most of the
coding in the accompanying
listing is concerned with the
machine code version of the
SHELLSORT about which more
later.
Shellsort — BASIC
version
One o f  the problems with
sorting methods that involve
string arrays is the dreaded
'garbage collection' problem
in many of the CBM BASICs.
This occurs when the memory
becomes cluttered u p  with
redundant strings and t h e
computer pauses for seconds
(or occasionally minutes) t o
clear the unwanted strings out
of memory. The solution to this
problem is to ensure that the
string data does not actually
move around in memory but
stays exactly where i t  is.
Instead, individual array
elements are 'pointed to' by a
pointer array and whilst it isthe
strings themselves that are
compared is their pointers that
eventually get swapped. This is
the method employed in the
BASIC version o f  t h e sort

presented f r o m  lines  2000
onwards, A  c ollec tion, of
randomly generated strings has
already been f e d  in t o  t w o
identical arrays, AS and B$ in
lines 1000-1080: AS is to be used
for the machine code demo
and the identical array in B$ is
to be used for the BASIC demo.
In lines 2000-2010 a 'pointer
array' is dimensioned and an
index number ranging from 1
to the N of the total array size
fed into it. The sort itself starts
in line 3000 and has been
expanded t o  5  lines  f o r
readability although it can be
squeezed into three. There is
some pretty complex coding
included here but for our pur-
poses we might note that in line
3020 the strings 'pointed to' by
the pointer array are compared
whilst the swops (if necessary)
are made t o  t h e  pointers
themselves in line 3030. There
is also an interesting use of a
DO-WHILE loop in the outer
(A) loop which loops whilst M
is greater than 0 but drops out
otherwise. This actually makes
the program highly efﬁcient
(for a BASIC program) as the
alternative would be a COTO
statement. Loops are always
more efﬁcient than GOTOs as
the addres s es  a r e  h e l d
internally on the stack and line
numbers do not have to be
'sought for' by the BASIC inter-
preter w hic h c an hav e a
marked s l o w i n g  e f f e c t ,
particularly i f  t h e  SORT is
appended to the end of a large
program where there are many
lines of code to be searched.
This BASIC version will take
about 227 seconds to sort 500
strings w h ic h  i s  ac tually
considerably faster than a
bubble sort which could well
take an hour for a sort of this
magnitude.
Shellsort —
machine code
version
This is a very long and complex
version o f  SHELLSORT i n
machine code but t o  some
extent it is an 'all-singing all-
dancing' model. It was written
in 1982 by Barrett and Wardill
my own contribution to it has
been t o  ensure that i t  will
transfer successfully to the avit
and the ViC and also to make it
completely relocateable so that
it can be put into any safe area
of memory.

As it is so long, the BASIC
loader will enable a check to be
made on every line of entry to
help to minimise typing errors
(but note here that if you get
two numbers i n  the wrong
order the checksum which is a
simple a d d it io n  w i l l  n o t
generate an error but the code
will not run correctly).
This sort will sort either real
or s tr ing arrays ( b u t  n o t
integers - read them into a real
array if necessary). The arrays
can be anywhere in memory
and you can specify the starting
point for the array which is
usually element 1, leaving 0 for
a header or a name. In the case
of string arrays, the routine is
designed to exit as soon as a
null string is encountered -this
means that you can insert a null
string at a particular point to
generate a n  ex it and thus
protect a 'tail' of data if this is
what you want to do.
This sort is extremely fast -
even for  machine code. For
example, it will sort 1000 strings
in-just over 4 seconds (whereas
a comparable machine code
bubble sort takes about 97
seconds). So the extra coding
actually buys a big increase in
speed and the ﬂexibility to use
with two types of arrays. It will
not work, though, with two-
dimensional arrays. In internal
construction, i t  is  n o t  t o o
dissimilar to the BASIC sort and
itself works by  manipulating
pointers in the string 'headers'
rather t h a n  t h e  s tr ings
themselves -  t his  i s  w e ll

Runecaster delves into a
number of new adventures,
including some for the Plus/4.
SOME MONTHS AGO I COMMENTED
fairly favourably on a book called 'The
Secret of Arendarvon Castle' published
by Addison-Wesley of Wokingham. The
book contained an adventure program
for you to type in, together with reams of
background material to assist you in
solving the adventure.
The program itself creates a n
adventure that is text only, takes quite
some time to load, has an unusual
movement control routine and does not
have a  particularly fast response
time...but nevertheless is original in
concept and well worth looking at.
Now there is another! Using a similar
format 'The Antagonists' also enables you
to create an interesting adventure game.
The programming follows a  similar
pattern to 'Arendarvon Castle'. Program
lines are set out in such a manner, that you
start keying in on Monday and continue
with daily doses, until the following
Sunday. O n  Monday you can start
playing...
The game itself is text only and uses a
fairly classic VERB-NOUN or  VERB-
NOUN-NOUN (unlock door with key)
input routine. Movement control uses the
standard North, South, Up, Down etc. The
range of commands given seems very
small, so at least there should be no
frustration trying to ﬁnd the correct words
to use.
There is no command to EXAMINE,
win adding to the simplicity of 'game
play'. Response to inputs is not fast but is
by no means annoyingly slow.
The attraction of 'The Antagonists'
apart from the simple, direct playing style,
is the storyline... Again the book supplies
much background material t o  the
adventure, and is a good 'read' in its own
right.
The scene is set on Earth, far in the
future, with the insects having taken over
from mankind, are any other humans still
alive?
One man escaped (but to where?),
leaving various clues behind him -  can
you follow him... The book has a host of
intriguing a nd original titbits o f
information. Can you read between the
lines and make sense of them?
The book is readily available, pick it up
Start them young
and have a quick browse. If you have not
got time to key in the program (that is a
good excuse anyway!) then a cassette of
the game can be purchased from Addison
Wesley.
If you have young children or younger
brothers or sisters, perhaps you would
like to introduce them to the joys and
frustrations o f  adventure gaming.
Admittedly this could mean less time for
you at the keyboard but then they may be
able to help you in the future.
There are one or two programs that
may serve as 'tasters' for a would-be
young adventurer. Mirrorsoft has several
ﬁne educational games aimed at the very
young. One is an obvious adventure
primer - 'Caesar's Travels' - not so much
an adventure in the sense that we

normally talk about, more an interactive
animated story.
Caesar the cat ﬁrst appeared as an
arcade game for  children, not of
tremendous interest to the adult but great
fun for  kids. Noteworthy, was the
excellent animation of Caesar himself:
Caesar's Travels is a  multi-choice
illustrated story, with some eighteeen
different endings, dependent upon the
choices made as the story unfolds.
Numbers and tune recognition play a
part to the story and a key card is supplied
to ﬁt over the function keys to help show
the choices t o  be  made. A  book
accompanies the cassette, which mimics
the program - even to the choices to be
made as it is read.
A true adventure aimed at the 7-14
year old is 'Super Gran - The Adventure'
from Tynesoft. Written by Brian Howath
and Mike Woodruff of  Adventure
International, based of course on the kid's

The instructions provided are not very
long but give several hints and tips that
may well help the younger player (not to
mention you too!). I'm not at all sure that
the average seven year old could tackle
this game from scratch but they would
certainly make a good 'member of the
team'.
The initial sequence only allows
movement between two locations and
offers only two objects to manipulate!
Not a  good start for the impatient
youngster... All I will say, is - read the
instructions carefully, all the hints you
need to start are there!
The graphics are drawn fairly quickly
and compliment the story, the input
routine is similar to others used by
Adventure International, with responses
appearing in a scrolling text window
below t he  picture a nd location
description.
You may save your present position to
tape for later re-loading... this is a useful
ability, as there are a  number of
unpleasant things that can happen to
Super Gran on her quest to hunt and
apprehend the evil Scunner Campbell.

adventure games are included together
with a  copy of  'The Adventurer's
Notebook' by Mike Gerrard.
The four games are all by Peter
Gerrard and are: Colossal Cave, a near
'clone' of  the original mainframe
adventure game; True Spit, set in the wild
west where you are a bounty hunter out
for blood; Spaced Out, science ﬁction in
deep space and ﬁnally; Underground
Adventure, the not uncommon situation
of exploring a vast network of caverns
The collection is worth the E14.95 it
costs just to get a copy of the classic
Colossal Cave for your Plus 4. Each
adventure allows you t o save your
progress and position to disc at any time.

The Fourth Protocol: The Game, is from
Hutchinson Computer Publishing Ltd and
is programmed by the Electronic Pencil
Company. It is another of the latest ﬂock
of 'icon driven' games and is loosely based
upon Frederick Forsyth's best seller of the
same name.
The storyline is that there is a Russian
plot to undermine the Western Alliance
by the use of a nuclear device - the blame
for this explosion to be put on the
Americans. The subsequent political
upheaval, forcing the election of a hard
left government, our withdrawal from
NATO and the establishment of a total-
itarian state in the UK.
The game is divided into three parts,
each is an independent program which
has to be solved before the next may be
attempted. The game starts with you
playing the role of John Preston, an MI5
investigator, who, on 1st June, has just
been made head of Section CI(A).
The initial game is  The NATO
Documents. Certain secret documents
turn up amongst the haul from a robbery
somewhere in England. The security
services are notiﬁed and John Preston
(you) is given the task of ﬁnding out who is
leaking secrets, to whom and why. The
answers to these questions will lead to the
uncovering of the Russian plot.
The game proceeds with you spending
most of your time in your ofﬁce! From
here you have access to the unit's central
computer (Cencom) and you will receive
reports from various sources.. ,which you
will have to evaluate and act upon. Apart
from the computer's ﬁles that you have
access, your principle method of
acquiring information is your network of
'watchers'...
You have one hundred operatives
who may be 'targeted' on people that you
consider may lead you towards a solution
to the problems that surround you.
The screen display consists of  a
number of pictures (or icons...) together
with a  movable cursor (a  pointing)
hand?). Position the cursor by using the
space-bar or the up/down cursor key and
press RETURN to activate any particular
action. This in turn produces a sub-menu
(again usually pictorial) from which to
choose a further relevant option.
The main menu options are:
1. Cencom Filing System, which holds
ﬁles generated by the player, together
with some of its own - but you have to
ﬁnd out what these are!
2 Surveillance, for assigning/recalling
watchers to and from suspects.
3 Calendar, automatically updates
throughout the game -  two a half
minutes roughly equal one day. The
player may advance the date if
required.

4 Telephone, rings if an incoming call,
calls out may be made - but you have
to know the number!
5 Assessment, this indicates your
progress and also your prestige within
MIS. If it drops too low then some
facilities will be withdrawn from your
control.
6 Information, three computer terminals
display Memos, Reports and Situation
Reports from your watchers.
7 Utilities, allows you to save and load
your game position.
On receiving the  various reports,
memos or telephone calls, you must
decide what course of action to take.
Whether to assign watchers or perhaps
delve into the Cencom for  more
information. Not all that is reported or
that you have to take action upon, is
relevant to the prime enquiry.. .what is,
YOU have to ﬁnd out for yourself!
Taxi...taxi!
The second section of The Fourth Protocol
is also icon driven, but more closely
resembles t he  classic format f or
adventure games. Move, examine, pick
up, drop, inventory; are all there but
because of the simpliﬁed usage brought
about by the icons you do not have to
think of 'how to use an object'...
You merely activate the icon for use
and the program presumes the correct
use,. .assuming of course that its use is
signiﬁcant at that location. The moving
icons cover not only the usual four
cardinal points but also stairs, doors and
enable you to hail a taxi! Telephones may
still be used and you also have the facility
to talk directly to anyone present.
The scenario for this part of the game
(The Bomb...) is that from your previous
investigations you

The third episode is called: The SAS
Assault. You have located the bomb, the
SAS are mixing it with the KGB and all you
have to do is defuse the device by using
the information you have gleaned in the
ﬁrst two parts! Instructions are typed in,
in the form VERB, VERB-NOUN or VERB-
ADJECTIVE-NOUN.
Whilst performing this rather delicate
operation, you must also keep a weather
eye open for KGB agents! If they realise
what you are doing they most certainly
will try to stop you. YOU must eliminate
them ﬁrst! You are armed, and the
joystick (or cursor keys) will move an
aiming 'cross-hair' around the screen.
You ﬁre using either the ﬁre button or
CTRL.
You have control...
The hallmark of a good game, arcade
action or adventure, is how addictive it is
and how easily the player can become
'involved' within the conﬁnes of the
game's 'universe'. The Fourth Protocol has
all the makings of  a  ﬁne strategy/
adventure, but be warned, the clues are
not all that obvious!
You should not expect to solve any
game worth its salt at the ﬁrst sitting, or
even at the second or third. But what you
should expect, is a growing awareness of
the right approach. This is particularly
true here, with over a dozen 'sub-plots'
that although not directly leading you to
the location of  the nuclear device
determine your effectiveness in the
department. This in turn may affect the
resources at your disposal.
Memos or Reports will mention places
and people - you will need to remember
these names in order to assign watchers.
Help is at hand in the form of Cencom,
not only can you read its existing ﬁles but
you can also save any incoming Reports or
Memos by your own ﬁle names.
Amongst other things, you will be
asked to check the security of 'Building
17', on doing so you are given a map of
the building and must decide where
security locks are to be ﬁtted. Do not
ignore the requests...or you will be
plagued by memo after memo!
Although correct action here is
unlikely to help you with the major task -
failure will affect your prestige.. .be
warned, do not lock up the toilets.
Once you have read the telephone
numbers in Cencom you also have access
to the main security computer a t
Blenheim but once again you will need to
know the name of a ﬁle before you can
read it!
Voice analysis, one time code pads,
passwords and codes, The Fourth Protocol
has them all! The pressure mounts (you
have until llth July...) and the frustrating
feeling that red-tape is bogging down a
vital investigation overcomes you. You
may be sitting behind a desk but what an
exciting desk!
Having made your deductions and
double checked your ﬁles, you have to
report y our  suspicions t o  y our
superiors, get it right and you get the
password to the next section. Wrong and
you may as well start again!
The second part has over 150 locations
for you to visit (no watchers this time!)
and a number of infuriating reasons to
impede your progress. Clues gleaned
from the ﬁrst section are followed up in
your attempts to locate the bomb.
Start by examining everything so as to
build up items that you may need. Not all
of these are in the building you start in, so
you must remember mention of other
Ministry buildings in the vicinity. Find the
location of the bomb (I haven't!) and
once again a password allows access to the
next program.
The concept of The Fourth Protocol, is
really quite exciting, especially the
deskbound ﬁrst episode. The icons are
few enough to be represented by large
pictures and are therefore very clear and
easily understood.
The second section is somewhat
reminiscent o f  Melbourne House's
Sherlock, I just hope it does not give me so
much frustration to solve! I suspect that
the third part is going to be the weakest
link, but then having got that far I do not
think I shall grumble too much!
The Forth Protocol: The Game, is
available for the CBM 64 on fast load
cassette at £12.95 and as we go to press, a
disc version is in the pipeline.

It's easy to
complain about
advertisements.
But which ones?
Every week millions of advertisements
appear in print. on posters or in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules
contained in the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
But some of them break the rules and
warrant your complaints.
If you're not sure about which ones they
are, however, drop us a line and we'll send you
an abridged copy of the Advertising Code.
Then, if an advertisement bothers
you, you'll be justiﬁed in bothering us.

If an advertisement is mrrong,wire here to put it right.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start -- but can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Wealdstone, Harrow, Middlesex H43 75J
Telephone; 01-861 1166
Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, t he only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer. 
•
Of course, we do also publish games
program5. and with classics like STIX. QUIRK
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer—
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card,
