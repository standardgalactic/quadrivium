Lecture 16 ~ Segment 1 
One-way ANOVA 
3 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  Appropriate when the predictors (IVs) are 
all categorical and the outcome (DV) is 
continuous 
– Most common application is to analyze data 
from randomized controlled experiments

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  More specifically, randomized controlled 
experiments that generate more than two 
group means 
– If only two group means then use: 
•  Independent t-test 
•  Dependent t-test 
5 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  If more than two group means then use: 
– Between groups ANOVA  
– Repeated measures ANOVA 
6 
Example 
•  Working memory training 
– Four independent groups (8, 12, 17, 19) 
•  IV: Number of training sessions 
•  DV: IQ gain 
•  Null hypothesis: All groups are equal

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  ANOVA typically involves NHST 
•  The test statistic is the F-test (F-ratio) 
–  F = (Variance between groups) /  
 
 
 (Variance within groups) 
9 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  Like the t-test and family of t-distributions 
•  The F-test has a family of F-distributions 
– The distribution to assume depends on 
•  Number of subjects per group 
•  Number of groups 
10 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
11 
One-way ANOVA 
•  F-ratio 
12 
F = between-groups variance / within-groups variance	

F = MSBetween / MSWithin 	

F = MSA / MSS/A

One-way ANOVA 
•  F = MSA / MSS/A 
•  MSA = SSA / dfA 
•  MSS/A = SSS/A/ dfS/A 
13 
One-way ANOVA 
•  SSA = n Σ(Yj - YT)2 
•  Yj are the group means 
•  YT is the grand mean 
14 
One-way ANOVA 
•  SSS/A = Σ(Yij - Yj)2 
•  Yij are individual scores 
•  Yj are the group means 
15 
One-way ANOVA 
•  dfA = a - 1 
•  dfS/A = a(n - 1) 
•  dfTOTAL = N - 1

Effect size 
•  R2 = η2 (eta-sqaured) 
•  η2 = SSA / SSTotal 
18 
Assumptions 
•  DV is continuous (interval or ratio variable) 
•  DV is normally distributed 
•  Homogeneity of variance 
•  Within-groups variance is equivalent for all groups 
–  Levene’s test 
19 
Homogeneity of variance 
•  If Levene’s test is significant then 
homogeneity of variance assumption has 
been violated 
– Conduct pairwise comparisons using a 
restricted error term

Segment summary 
•  ANOVA is used to compare means, 
typically in experimental research 
– Categorical IV 
– Continuous DV 
26 
Segment summary 
•  ANOVA assumes homogeneity of variance 
– Evaluate with Levene’s test 
27 
Segment summary 
•  Post-hoc tests, such as Tukey’s 
procedure, allow for multiple pairwise 
comparisons without an increase in the 
probability of a Type I error

Post-hoc tests

Post-hoc tests 
•  Post-hoc tests, such as Tukey’s 
procedure, allow for multiple pairwise 
comparisons without an increase in the 
probability of a Type I error 
31 
Post-hoc tests 
•  Many procedures are available; the degree 
to which p-values are adjusted varies 
according to procedure 
– Most liberal: No adjustment 
– Most conservative: Bonferroni procedure
