Introduction
D

ata visualization (also known as data viz) is a hot topic. 
With the development of more data sources, such as social 
media platforms, photos, and customer reviews, Big Data has 
become a concern for small businesses and large corporations 
alike. Data is coming from all parts of the business like finance, 
customer service, and sales, and using it effectively helps you gain 
a ­competitive advantage.
It’s no longer sufficient to use a multiple-page spreadsheet to pres­
ent findings about your data. You need to tell visual data stories 
that produce important insights. This book shows you some ways 
to create and display data visualizations, including infographics, 
dashboards, and business intelligence (BI) graphics.
Many experts in the field have created inspiring data visualizations 
that dazzle the eye. You should be inspired by them, rather than 
humbled. Not every data viz can — or should — be a devastating 
work of art. Some visualizations just need to get the job done. But 
you do want to give yourself every opportunity to create some­
thing special. We believe that reading this book will put you on the 
right path.
About This Book
This book was written to provide you all the information you need 
to get started creating high-value data visualizations. Use it as a 
reference guide when you’re trying to select the right data, charts, 
text, and menus to add 
to your creations.
Data visualizations can be visually creative, such as infographics, 
or straightforward, such as dashboards. The key to creating the 
right one for you is to follow the Business Intelligence Dashboard 
Formula (BIDF), outlined in Part III of this book, and apply it to the 
different types of visualizations you need to create. It is suggested 
that you go through Part III in the order in which it is written so 
that you can follow the progression of the data viz from start 
to finish.

Within this book, you may note that some web addresses break 
across two lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and 
want to visit one of these web pages, simply key in the web 
address exactly as it’s noted in the text, pretending that the line 
break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as an e-book, you’ve got 
it easy; just click the web address to be taken directly to the web 
page.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you’re a highly intelligent person who is both 
creative and business-minded, with a flair for presenting visually 
appealing graphics — you wouldn’t be reading this book if you 
weren’t, right? — but you may be making your first foray into the 
world of data viz. So we also assume that you’re reading this book 
for any of the following reasons:
	
✓	You want to demonstrate to your colleagues that you can make 
data more useful by displaying it visually.
	
✓	You need to gain more direct knowledge about how your 
customers feel about your products.
	
✓	You’re tired of using a spreadsheet program to create all your 
data visualizations and want to try other techniques.
	
✓	Your manager wants to use BI dashboards, and you’ve been 
chosen to make that happen.
	
✓	You want to provide your customers with useful data visualiza­
tions that help raise your company’s visibility when it is shared 
by others.
Icons Used in This Book
We packed this book with all sorts of tips, warnings, and other 
good hints so that you can benefit from our experience. They’re 
identified by the following icons:
	
This icon lets you know about a way to make things easier, faster,

Visualization”
	
✓	Additional information on using the Business Intelligence 
Dashboard Formula (BIDF) Blueprint
	
✓	A downloadable worksheet to help you determine what to 
include in your data viz
	
✓	A Part of Tens called “Top Ten Blunders to Avoid When Creating 
a Data Visualization”
Where to Go from Here
You can travel at least two paths when reading this book: You 
can start at the beginning and wend your way around the topics 
to familiarize yourself with each one, or you can skip right to the 
juicy parts that interest you. It’s up to you. Either way, we want 
you to feel confident that you’ve chosen the right path for yourself. 
We hope that this book will get you where you want to go. Enjoy 
the journey!

Introducing Data Visualization
In This Chapter
▶	Delving into data visualization
▶	Deploying data visualizations for your audience
▶	Embracing the data visualization design process
I

f you’re reading this book, you’re probably interested in finding better ways 
to visualize your information. When you help people visualize the meaning 
of data, you add tremendous value to any organization. In this chapter, we look 
at what data visualization is and what it means to different groups.
When it comes to gaining valuable insight in a company setting, the use of 
data visualization is critical. Companies are desperate to view and learn from 
their Big Data. Data visualization, however, is a growing field with a critical 
shortage of true experts.
	
Big Data refers to the voluminous amounts of infor­
mation that can be collected from social media data 
as well as internal company data. Analyzing and 
extracting insights from it is the goal.
After reading this book, you’ll be able to help fill that 
role for your company, whether you’re building your 
first data visualization or your hundredth one.
Understanding Data Visualization
Here’s a simple definition of data visualization: It’s 
the study of how to represent data by using a visual 
or artistic approach rather than the traditional 
reporting method.

Part I: Getting Started with Data Visualization 
Two of the most popular types of data visualizations are dashboards and 
infographics, both of which use a combination of charts, text, and images to 
communicate the message of the data. The practice of transforming data into 
meaningful and useful information via some form of visualization or report is 
called Business Intelligence (BI).
Understanding the importance of data viz
Data visualizations (you can call them data viz for short) are widely used 
in companies of all sizes to communicate their data stories. This practice, 
known as BI, is a multibillion-dollar industry. It continues to grow exponen­
tially as more companies seek ways to use their big data to gain valuable 
insight into past, current, and future events.
With the recent popularity of social media and mobile apps, the amount of 
data that’s generated on a moment-to-moment basis is astounding. For this 
reason, many companies find that making sense of that data requires the use 
of some form of data visualization. It’s virtually impossible to view 1 million 
rows of data and try to make sense of it!
Imagine going out to your garage every morning, jumping into your car, and 
then heading to work blindfolded. Chances are that you wouldn’t make it 
past the driveway without having an accident. The same is true for a 
company that lacks insight into what its data is telling it. This lack of insight 
is dangerous, and its ramifications could be quite costly, both short- and 
long-term. Therefore, it’s critical that companies use their data to gain 
insights about their performance.
	
This book focuses specifically on data visualizations that contain intelligent data 
(data that is actionable) and that provide some value to a company by enabling 
a person or group of people to make faster decisions based on that data.
Discovering who uses data viz
Data visualizations are for everybody. All of us use them, whether or not we 
realize it. If you use apps on your smartphone, for example, chances are that 
you depend on data visualizations to make critical decisions on an almost 
daily basis. Do you ever use a weather app to determine how to dress for that 
day? If you open the app and see a cloud with lightning at the top of the app, 
you have a good idea that it’s going to be a stormy, rainy day without having 
to read any data about temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity.
This example shows you how a simple visual helps you gain quick insight 
and make a quick decision (in this case, to wear a raincoat and carry an 
umbrella). Believe it or not, you just consumed a good data visualization!

 Chapter 1: Introducing Data Visualization
Recognizing the Traits of Good Data Viz
Good data visualizations come in all shapes and sizes, but all of them have 
certain traits, which we discuss in this section.
Mico once worked with a talented graphic-design expert named Natasha 
Lloyd to deliver a well-received presentation called “How to Build a 
Successful Business Intelligence Dashboard” at a major global conference. 
When she was asked what she thought was important about creating visu­
alizations, Natasha said her focus wasn’t on what was pretty versus ugly; 
her focus was on the end-user experience. Table 1-1 shows the key items 
discussed during the presentation.
Table 1-1	
Traits of a Good Data Visualization
Trait
Description
Useful
People use it on a regular basis and can make relevant decisions 
by viewing all the information they need in one place.
Desirable
It’s not only easy to use but also pleasurable to use.
Usable
People who use it can accomplish their goals quickly and easily.
Although these traits sound more like descriptions of a new car than descrip­
tions of business data, focusing on these three traits for all your data visual­
izations should ensure that you produce something that’s not only great to 
look at but that also provides value and deep insight to those who use it.
	
Although the information in Table 1-1 may seem to be simple, we advise you 
to use it the way we do: as a tool to measure every data viz against, to ensure 
that you’re focusing on the most important items. Your main goal should be 
to develop a data visualization that provides key insights to its users.
Embracing the Design Process
One of the main goals of this book is to guide you through the process of 
scoping, designing, and building your first data viz utilizing intelligence data.
Many methodologies and best practices are available in the marketplace. The 
ones described in this book are based on Mico’s experience in building more 
than 400 enterprise-grade intelligent data visualizations, first as a consultant 
and then as founder of her company (BI Brainz). The methods in the book

have been tried and tested not only by Mico’s team but also by thousands of 
people at some of the biggest companies in the world.
	
Although our recommended approach has been tested around the globe with 
lots of success, you may find that you can improve on or tweak it to better 
match your current environment or situation. Treat it as a starting point and 
solid foundation.
This book uses a methodology that Mico developed, called the BI Dashboard 
Formula (BIDF). To help you understand the process, we provide access to 
some of the templates and openly discuss our proven approach to developing 
these very powerful intelligent data visualizations. This method shows you 
the “what” (as in what data to display) as well as the “how” (as in how to add 
the right visuals to derive a powerful and compelling data viz).
	
Think of the data viz development process as being like building a house. 
First, you need to ensure you have the right location. Then you must develop 
a clear blueprint that shows exactly how the house will look. Last but not 
least, you lay the foundation and build the house. BIDF teaches you how to 
develop a visualization from start to finish.
We advise that you read this book from start to finish and avoid skipping any 
chapters, especially in Part II. Although the sky is the limit when it comes to 
building fancy data visualizations, creating useful data viz that provide true 
value by displaying intelligent data does require some background and a 
well-outlined process. A step-by-step process is explained in this book.
Ensuring Excellence in Your Data Visualization
Before you move on to the basics of building your data visualization, you 
should have some idea of what criteria make a data visualization excellent. 
An excellent data visualization has the following qualities: 
	
✓	It’s visually appealing. The advent of more sophisticated visual creation 
tools and the high quality of mobile apps have raised the bar very high 
on the user experience. It’s only going to get higher with the evolution of 
technology such as Google Glass. Your visualization will go unused if it 
looks like it was designed with old technology.
	
✓	It’s scalable. If your data viz is successful, others will want to use and 
leverage it. Be sure to build your visualization on a system that’s scal­
able for accessibility and for future maintenance and modifications.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Data Visualization
	
✓	It gives the user the right information. It’s a problem when users focus 
on the visual or a particular feature and not on what they really need. 
Before creating a visualization, define exactly how it will be used, such 
as for self-service, drill-down, deep analysis, or executive overview.
	
✓	It’s accessible. An accessible visualization is easy to use and can be 
modified easily when necessary. Also, the data must be accessible on 
any device, at any time, at any place. This feature is critical to user 
adoption.
	
✓	It allows rapid development and deployment. Gone are the days of 
waterfall (chart-type) projects and drawn-out data-viz deployments and 
builds. Users need their information today, and if you can’t provide it in 
a timely fashion, they’ll find other ways to get it.

Exploring Common Types of Data 
Visualizations
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding interactive graphics
▶	Selecting content for visualizations
▶	Looking at how different fields use visualizations
▶	Using cool infographics
W

e’ve all seen impressive visualizations that make us feel humble. You 
may ask, “Could I do something like that?” Chances are that if you’re 
creating a data visualization for the first time, the answer may be “not 
yet.” Creating data visualizations, like anything else, requires you 
to acquire some basic information and build your knowledge 
over time.
This chapter presents different types of visualizations 
so that you can familiarize yourself with the many 
options you have for creating data visualizations of 
your own.
Understanding the Difference 
between Data Visualization 
and Infographics
To simplify the process of understanding visualizations, 
we focus on the two most popular types: data visualizations 
and infographics. Because the use of graphical data visualizations is

Part I: Getting Started with Data Visualization 
growing quickly, there is a bit of disagreement about how to define a data 
visualization versus an infographic. You may believe that the definition is clear, 
but when you get into more complex visualizations, you can start to wonder.
In their book Designing Data Visualizations (O’Reilly Media), Noah Iliinsky 
and Julie Steele use the following three criteria to determine whether to call a 
graphic a data visualization or an infographic: 
	
✓	Method of generation: This criterion refers to what goes into creating 
the graphic itself. If a lot of original illustrations are created to explain 
the data, for example, it’s likely to be an infographic. You often see info­
graphics with beautiful, elaborate images created to explain the infor­
mation. Figure 2-1 shows an example created by Coleen Corcoran and 
Joe Prichard. You can see the original image at http://thumbnails.
visually.netdna-cdn.com/carland-a-century-of-motoring-
in-america_50290aaca56d5.jpg.
Figure 2-1: Carland displays history in an easy-to-follow way.
	
✓	Quantity of data represented: Typically, data visualizations have more 
and different kinds of data from infographics. Also, the data in data visu­
alizations changes frequently to indicate changes in status. In addition, 
an infographic is less likely to include interactive numbers.
	
✓	Degree of aesthetic treatment applied: This criterion refers to the art­
fulness of the graphic. If a lot of design work has gone into displaying 
information, the graphic is likely to be an infographic.

 Chapter 2: Exploring Common Types of Data Visualizations
We have another criterion to help you determine the difference between a 
data visualization and an infographic: whether the graphic is interactive or 
static.
An interactive graphic tells a different story each time new data is inserted. 
An interactive visualization helps you determine what the data is telling you. 
A static visualization depicts a data story that you want to explain to others.

You can use the information in Table 2-1 to determine whether you’re work­
ing with an infographic or a data visualization. This table becomes useful 
when you want to decide what type of visualization to create for specific 
information and/or low-quality graphics.

Read on to find out what types of content you can put in an infographic 
or data visualization.
Picking the Right Content Type
When you’re creating a data visualization to tell the story of your data, you 
can use many content types other than text and numbers. The key is to select 
visuals that are not only attractive but that also match the data you have. 
This is not an insignificant task. Your data viz will benefit from careful consid­
eration of a variety of different content types.
Following are several to consider:
	
✓	Graph: An x and y axis is used to depict data as a visualization.
	
✓	Diagram: A visual that shows how something works.
	
✓	Timeline: A chronology is depicted on a graph to show how something 
happens or changes.
	
✓	Template: A guide for something that a user needs to fill in or develop.
	
✓	Checklist: A list of tasks to be completed that can be crossed off when 
they have been accomplished.

 Chapter 2: Exploring Common Types of Data Visualizations
	
✓	Flow chart: A sequential set of instructions that show how something 
works.
	
✓	Metaphor: Comparisons of two dissimilar things for the purpose of 
making a vivid description.
	
✓	Mind map: Maps that enable you to show the big picture and the 
details of a topic on one sheet of paper. The main topic is in the 
center and the subtopics radiate out from it. Figure 2-3 shows an 
example of a mind map about the best-selling book Brain Rules by John 
Medina (Pear Press). It was created using the MindMeister software 
(https://www.mindmeister.com/100879355/brain-rules-
12-principles-for-surviving-and-thriving-at-work-home-
and-school).
	
When you see a visualization that contains interesting content types, you 
should clip the image and save it to a file for future reference. That way, you’ll 
always have images that really inspire you. You can also refer to Chapter 15, 
which provides a list of hand-picked resources to keep you informed and 
inspired.
	
One caveat: Make sure that your data fits the visualization that you choose. 
Don’t try to shoehorn data in just for the sake of art.

a data viz.

Appreciating Interactive Data Visualizations
Sophisticated software allows people to do analysis today that they only 
dared dream about five years ago. Couple this with mounting data stores, 
and you have an interesting choice. You can put your head in the sand and 
hope that the data stops multiplying, or you can work at making it a valu­
able asset.
Some companies choose to ignore the growing stacks of data and continue to 
rely on standard methods like spreadsheets that offer little customer insight. 
Others take a leap and bring in software that helps them analyze both their 
structured and their unstructured data (such as social media data). They 
can then create data visualizations that help them make more educated, fact-
based business decisions and predictions.
The jury is still out as to whether most corporations will take full advan­
tage of their data for competitive purposes. Companies that do realize 
that being able to analyze many forms of data at the same time in the form 
of interactive visualizations have a competitive advantage. From under­
standing the sentiments of their customers to examining their buying 
habits, the possibilities to get ahead of one’s competitors by viewing one’s 
data are endless!
Companies that take advantage of their available data by putting it into inter­
active data visualizations can reap the following benefits:
	
✓	Self-service: Users can manipulate the data to find out specific things 
they need to know.
	
✓	Immediacy: Users can be alerted to situations that require immediate 
attention.
	
✓	Improved collaboration: When everyone on a team is looking at the 
same data, the team can solve problems more easily.
	
✓	Simplicity: Users are presented with only the key elements that enable 
them to get both the big picture and the details in one visualization.
	
✓	Insight: Users can glean important revelations about the company’s per­
formance from a good interactive visualization.
	
✓	Depiction of patterns: Patterns make it easier for users to analyze 
the data and identify trends. It is unlikely that users would be able 
to recognize patterns when presented with millions of lines of data in 
a spreadsheet; visualizations make it easier to identify patterns at 
a glance.

 Chapter 2: Exploring Common Types of Data Visualizations
Groups that use data visualization receive many of these benefits. Next, we 
look at how different fields use data visualizations to their advantage.
Observing Visualizations in Different Fields
Many fields of study now use data visualization to provide insight to their 
audiences about all types of data — political, financial, scientific, and his­
torical. Like anything that gains popularity, you can find both good and bad 
examples of data visualizations (see Chapter 13).
Politics and government
In the field of politics and government, data analysis has taken center stage. 
Government agencies are combining social media data with demographic 
information to inform decisions and convey information. Figure 2-4 shows a 
couple of visualizations that describe how recovery funds are distributed. You 
can see the original image at www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx.
Figure 2-4: Government Recovery data by zip code.
Finance/social economics
Many financial institutions use visualizations to inform their clients about 
their own portfolios as well as current economic issues, such as interest 
rates and tax implications. Social data is also a common topic for visualiza­
tions — things like Tweets, shares, and check-ins, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Part I: Getting Started with Data Visualization 
Science
Science has always relied on some kind of visual to depict information. 
Advances in technology allow much more data to be analyzed at one time so 
that patterns can be more easily identified. Figure 2-6 shows a visualization 
that plots the occurrence of hurricanes since 1851. You can clearly see that 
some areas are more heavily affected than others. You can see the original 
image at www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/29/every-
hurricane-visualised-since-1851.
History
Historical data is a great use of visualizations because it incorporates 
a large amount of data in a relatively small space. For example, you can 
follow the evolution of an idea or the growth of a company. You can also 
choose the segments to fit the data instead of forcing the data into some 
artificial designation.

For example, Figure 2-7 is an infographic showing how modes of communica­
tion have changed over the years. Notice that the segments of time are not 
uniform. However, if you are showing the growth of something, like the car 
industry, you could designate uniform periods to show which periods had 
the most explosive growth over the century. Check out the original image at

Part I: Getting Started with Data Visualization 
Using Dashboards
As we discuss in several chapters of the book, Mico’s company 
BIBrainz.com uses her Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula (BIDF) to help 
users around the world build their dashboards and understand their data.
Dashboards allow staff to see their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and 
important alerts on one screen. They have become increasingly popu­
lar because of the growing amount of data companies need to harness. 
Dashboards enable companies to put measures from different departments in 
one graphic.
Following are some benefits of dashboards:
	
✓	They remove the need to update manual calculations.
	
✓	They focus on the measures that are most important to the audience.
	
✓	They alert stakeholders to action(s) that must be taken.
	
✓	They increase productivity by showing the most important data on one 
screen so that users don’t have to go searching for it.
How do you know whether you’re on the right track when creating your first 
dashboard? Here are three questions to ask yourself:
	
✓	Will any stakeholders champion the use of the dashboard going 
­forward? Unless some people believe in the data and want the dash­
board to be used, the dashboard could languish unnoticed after the first 
flurry of interest.
	
✓	Will someone update and maintain the numbers in the dashboard? 
You need to make sure that whoever looks at the data is seeing current 
data that takes changes in company direction into account. Having a 
dashboard that reflects bad or outdated data is as unhelpful as having 
no data.
	
✓	Is the dashboard truly easy to understand? This issue probably is 
the most important one that we cover in this book. If the visualization 
in the dashboard is confusing, no one will use it, no matter how 
pretty it is.
Discovering Infographics
Infographics have gained great favor of late. If done well, they can illumi­
nate a problem and tell an interesting story. Infographics have generated 
great interest on the Internet because of their ability to entertain as well as 
enlighten.

23
 Chapter 2: Exploring Common Types of Data Visualizations
Infographics use design rules to artfully display text, numbers, metaphors, 
and other data types. You should use a few key guidelines when you’re 
planning your own infographic or evaluating one:
	
✓	Make the infographic easy to understand. First and foremost, an info­
graphic should be simple. If the information isn’t clear or leads to 
confusion, you’ve failed.
	
✓	Make it accurate. Infographics reflect actual data. The artwork must 
accurately reflect the data and carefully report the trends or patterns of 
the data. Double-check your work.
	
✓	Provide your sources. Data sources typically are listed at the bottom of 
an infographic. If you want yours to have credibility, list all the places 
where the data was gathered.
	
✓	Choose complementary colors. An infographic should be eye-catching. 
If you have trouble determining what colors to use, many online tools 
can help. For more information using color in your visualizations, read 
Chapter 10.
	
✓	Make it worthwhile. Although it’s true that infographics can be frivo­
lous or silly, most business users are looking for solid information. Take 
the time to create something that others will want to share.
Examining different types of infographics
Several types of infographics are currently popular. The following list can 
help you choose the right type for the information you’re trying 
to ­illustrate:
	
✓	Case study: If you’ve conducted a specific inquiry about a particular 
topic and want to share the results, try a case study. In the context of an 
infographic, a case study shows the goals, objectives, and outcome of a 
particular campaign or action plan.
	
✓	Chronology: The content of a chronology follows a logical, dated 
order, as shown in Figure 2-8. Use this type of infographic if you want 
to recount something like the history of a product or the growth 
of an industry. You can view the chronology shown in the figure at 
http://educationcloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
creativity-infographic.jpg.
	
✓	Comparison: When you’re trying to show the difference between one 
item and another, try a comparison. Figure 2-9 shows a comparison 
of iOS 6 and iOS 7 icons; in the comparison you can see that some 
changes make sense, whereas others seem to change simply for 
the sake of change. See the original image at http://mashable.

✓	Compilation: If you want to inform your audience about a key topic and 
make it memorable, use a compilation of information as an infographic. 
A compilation refers to a collection of information that is gathered from 
a variety of sources into one cohesive whole.
	
✓	Expert advice: Dispensing expert advice in an infographic is a great way 
to establish yourself as an expert. It also “helps the medicine go down” if 
you’re recommending something difficult.

a great way to educate your audience. Infographics often use visuals to 
get the message across, as shown in Figure 2-10. The original image is 
available at www.stack.com/2012/06/20/how-to-properly-use-

Sometimes, infographics are just for fun. Don’t hesitate to use humor when 
you display data on a lighthearted subject. It’s okay to entertain your users 
as you provide information. Just be sure to represent the data accurately.
Taking advantage of online infographic tools
If you want to try your hand at infographics, a lot of great online tools are 
available. Many of them supply graphic and design templates that simplify 
things for do-it-yourselfers.
Here are some tools that you may want to consider:
	
✓	Piktochart (http://piktochart.com): Create your own infographics 
by using templates. Free and fee versions are available.
	
✓	Venngage (https://venngage.com): This tool is a great way to create

Knowing What You Must 
about Big Data
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding Big Data
▶	Seeing how Big Data is used in business
▶	Choosing tools for visualization
A

nyone who spends time online instinctively knows that data is continu­
ing to grow at a rapid rate. But the magnitude of data growth may shock 
you. According to Marcia Conner, in her article “Data on Big Data,” 90 percent 
of all the data in the world has been created in the last two years. (See the 
article at http://marciaconner.com/blog/data-on-
big-data.)
If you’re doing business today, it’s no secret that you’re 
bombarded by all kinds of data. The key is to use this 
data as an opportunity to create a competitive advan­
tage. In other words, if you take steps to harness 
and analyze the data you have, you will be ahead of 
many of your competitors who are still waiting to 
figure out what to do with their Big Data.
Defining Big Data
Suddenly, everyone is talking about the presence of Big 
Data and its impact. Hasn’t there always been a steady 
stream of data that companies can employ? What makes the 
data so “big” that its mere presence can’t be managed?

Part I: Getting Started with  Data Visualization 
These questions and many others probably come to mind. The best way 
to answer them is to think about how you currently interact with devices 
throughout your day:
	
✓	Communicate via smartphones
	
✓	Send reports, proposals, and contracts digitally
	
✓	Buy products via online accounts
	
✓	Use credit cards at retail stores
	
✓	Monitor your car and house with various electronic devices such as tem­
perature gauges and dashboard computers
	
Don’t forget that data is generated when you interact on social media 
and in search engines. Most of this data was unavailable a mere 
20 years ago.
Every one of the preceding activities throws off mountains of data. The 
retailer sees what you buy; the smartphone provider knows who you call; 
the car dashboard records your driving habits. You (and your customers) 
are a walking mass of data. All this acquired information is what we’re talking 
about when we say Big Data.
Seeing How Big Data Changes Business
It’s interesting to note that Big Data changes the way employees work. Here 
are a few examples:
	
✓	Salespeople can access data and make decisions about offers right from 
the customer’s location.
	
✓	Customer service representatives can access information about buying 
habits and needs while they’re online or on the phone with customers.
	
✓	Financial managers can access specific data to meet their needs, and 
marketing departments can drill down to specific campaign details.
We’re sure that you can see the value Big Data brings to any organization that 
makes an effort to use it. You get not only productivity gains but also faster 
insight into your problems. Interestingly, most CEOs used to believe that 
their fortunes were strictly in their customer lists. Now, many are coming to 
believe that the inclusion of Big Data and the attendant insights it brings will 
be the source of their fortunes.
With Big Data, you can become customer-centric in ways you never could 
before. You can go beyond transactional reports about customer buying 
habits and drill down to customer sentiment and motivation. This chapter 
looks at what Big Data is and how you can harness it to create data 
visualizations. The opportunities are limitless.

 Chapter 3: Knowing What You Must about Big Data 
	
One thing that businesses should focus on is the fact that they can now get 
answers to questions they couldn’t previously ask, which makes asking the 
right questions a very important factor in Big Data analysis. You’re only as 
good as the questions you ask.
Getting to know your customers
Companies today have the opportunity to “know” each customer’s individual 
habits. Instead of creating artificial groups of customers who may have some 
similar interests, businesses can effectively segment and customize their 
offers to each customer. By knowing customers’ habits, companies can not 
only target niches more accurately but also uncover new markets for their 
goods, understand customer needs more fully, and extend well-timed special 
offers.
Here are three major benefits of using Big Data to understand your customers:
	
✓	Customer satisfaction: You can create fans who are loyal and who speak 
about your products to others on social media. This situation creates a 
sales force that money can’t buy.
	
✓	More money per customer: Offering just the right product at the right 
time increases buying.
	
✓	Retention: You keep customers longer by showing them that you 
understand their needs and can provide them with products that meet 
those needs.
Companies that use Big Data can extract value in several new ways. The 
following key factors shed light on why companies believe that Big Data 
presents such a great opportunity:
	
✓	New tools are available. You can use the tools that are now available to 
analyze this new data in near real time. These tools include data sensors 
that collect massive amounts of information about how machines and 
electronics are performing.
	
✓	New insights are possible. Being able to analyze the data provides the 
capability to extract major insights that can increase profits.
	
✓	New types of data are being generated. Some of social data deals with 
customer sentiment, which is invaluable to companies. Customer senti­
ment data lets companies know what offers will succeed because they 
learn how customers talk about and review their products.
	
✓	New developments make cloud storage a reality. Warehousing data 
is less an issue now that businesses can use cloud storage, which is 
cheaper and just as accessible.
All this sounds pretty good. But Big Data also presents a few challenges. The 
next section looks at the essence of the problem.

Discovering the Four V’s
To understand the challenges of Big Data, the Business Intelligence (BI) 
community commonly designates what it calls the Four V’s:
	
✓	Volume: Tons of data is generated around the globe, and the volume will 
continue to increase exponentially in the coming years.
	
✓	Variety: Different and new kinds of structured and unstructured 
data (such as social media data) are being created. (For more 
information, see “Collecting structured and unstructured data,” 
later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Velocity: The pace at which data is mounting is accelerating, and 
companies’ ability to analyze it in real time is crucial to the development 
of tangible offers that turn shoppers into actual customers.
	
✓	Veracity:Veracity refers to the trustworthiness of data. Is the data that’s 
being generated valid? When analyzing data about customer sentiment 
on social media, for example, can you trust everything that’s been 
written?
IBM has created an excellent infographic illustrating the Four V’s, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. (You can find the image at http://cdn.dashburst.com/
wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-four-v-s-of-big-data.jpg.)
Figure 3-1: The Four V’s.
These four factors influence the management of Big Data. Whether you’re 
a small-business owner or an executive of a major corporation, you are 
affected by the onslaught of data. The following sections dig a bit deeper into 
the kinds of data you will be working with.

 Chapter 3: Knowing What You Must about Big Data 
Collecting structured and unstructured data
Data collected in the past was structured and could fit into neat rows and 
columns. An example of this would be an Excel spreadsheet with delimited 
data (data that was separated by a specific character, such as a comma). 
Most internal information specialists were content to display this data 
(such as customer records) in long spreadsheets. They were tasked with 
reporting what the data said, and everyone used the same results. There 
was no opportunity to visualize the story that the data told to extract 
valuable insights. The data wasn’t interactive and didn’t allow for customiza­
tion. It was valuable to a point, but there was no way to understand what the 
customer thought about the product after they bought it. You would only 
know that the product had been bought. And that data is only one part of 
the puzzle.
Today, companies are facing a mountain of a new type of data: unstructured 
data, which doesn’t always come in a neat package. Following are a few 
examples of this type of data:
	
✓	Opinions: Opinions are gathered by review sites such as Yelp, shown 
in Figure 3-2. You can access the reviews directly or use a tool that 
scrapes the data from the site so that you can put that data in your 
own data-viz tool.
Figure 3-2: Restaurant reviews on Yelp.
	
✓	Visuals: Visuals are chosen by users of sites such as Pinterest, shown in 
Figure 3-3. In the case of Pinterest, you can access the site to see what 
images about and by your company have been pinned by customers 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part I: Getting Started with  Data Visualization 
who are searching for your company’s name. You may have data about 
which of your company’s pins are being re-pinned by others as well as 
data about people who have seen your company’s product or image 
elsewhere on the web and have pinned it directly to Pinterest for others 
to find.
Figure 3-3: The Pinterest site can generate a lot of data for a company.
	
✓	Smartphone data: Phone records, e-mails, and other search data are 
available from your phone.
This unstructured content represents data that’s incredibly valuable to any 
online business. The key to using the data is to utilize software programs 
(such SAP) that enable you to combine structured data with unstructured 
data to gain a greater understanding of the business and its customers. From 
this analysis, companies can begin to make predictions about customer 
behavior and revenue generation.
	
Typically, organizations that use unstructured data use natural language 
processing software to analyze it.
Ensuring the use of quality data
The quality of your data, not your choice of tool, determines the value of 
your visualization. In a 2013 article in the Harvard Business Review titled 
“When Data Visualization Works — and When It Doesn’t,” author Jim 
Stikeleather pointed out three elements that affect the efficacy of data:
	
✓	Data quality: Obviously, if your data is incomplete or full of errors, your 
data visualization will be useless. But it’s not always easy to determine 
what data is missing and, therefore, how reliable the predictions you 
make with it will be. It’s important to pay attention to the quality of

35
 Chapter 3: Knowing What You Must about Big Data 
your data up front to make sure that your conclusions are usable. Work 
with your IT department and major stakeholders to determine as much 
about your data as you can. Find out about its origins and how often it is 
updated.
	
✓	Context: Context refers to your ability to draw conclusions from your 
data. If you don’t understand how the data was sourced, how current it 
is, and so on, you risk drawing faulty conclusions from it.
	
✓	Biases: It’s important to acknowledge any biases you have about the 
data before you create your visualization. Do you want the conclusions 
to support a pet theory? Are you making the data visualization look a 
certain way to support your conclusions? You must divest yourself of 
these notions before you begin.
	
Regarding biases, when you look at any data visualization, it’s a good idea to 
ask yourself whether the data was created by someone who may have a stake 
in a certain outcome. Sometimes, the developer’s bias may be unconscious. 
Make an agreement with the major stakeholders that the data you use must 
be certified by IT so that you avoid any bias that might be introduced when 
the stakeholders themselves provide the data.
Avoiding Dying by Tool Choice
Throughout this book, we state that the most important thing to focus on is 
data preparation, not tools. That said, we understand that it’s easy to be dis­
tracted by the variety of tools that are available for creating visualization.
All tools are not created equal. Tying yourself to a tool before you know what 
needs to be displayed is a recipe for failure. If your company has already 
chosen a specific tool, obviously, you have to figure out how to work with 
that one. But if you have the freedom to decide on a tool, make sure to let the 
data drive your choice.
When choosing a tool, it’s important to know what separates truly advanced 
tools from simpler ones. In a 2012 Forrester Wave report titled “Advanced 
Data Visualization (ADV) Platforms,” Bob Evelson and Noel Yuhanna outlined 
several points that separate the current crop of advanced tools from older, 
less powerful tools:
	
✓	Dynamic data content: The data is interactive and can be updated regu­
larly to show changes.
	
✓	Visual querying: Users can click icons and other visuals to update the 
data.
	
✓	Multiple-dimension, linked visualization: Multiple types of data can be 
linked to show different dimensions.

✓	Animated visualization: An animated visualization enables you to 
quickly go to the data you want to see so that you don’t have to spend 
time clicking through data that’s not relevant to you.
	
✓	Personalization: The software assigns different levels of access to 
the data as well as access to different slices of that data based on the 
particular user.
	
✓	Business-actionable alerts: The software triggers alerts that can notify 
various stakeholders when appropriate.
You may want to evaluate your tools based on these measures. You can

We can’t know which tool is right for you, of course. Tableau and QlikView 
have growing adoption rates, so we discuss them in more detail in the 
following sections.
Tableau
Tableau has gained popularity because it’s an easy-to-use, drag-and-drop soft­
ware tool. Both free and fee-based versions of the software are available.
The free version (www.tableausoftware.com/public), shown in 
Figure 3-4, allows users to craft public data to tell a story. Typically, it’s used 
by individuals or small companies. It’s optimized for the iPad and Android 
devices.

Using Charts Effectively
In This Chapter
▶	Keeping charts simple
▶	Using charts that are clear to users
▶	Knowing when to use dials
M

ost people are introduced to charts pretty early in their school 
careers. Teachers use charts for attendance, seating, spelling, history 
lessons, and so on. This is probably why, unless you’re a math major, you 
hope you never have to deal with charts again.
But it’s time to take a second look. New tools have made it much easier 
to turn raw data into a good-looking chart. In addition, as a person facing 
the Big Data age, you probably can’t escape it anyway. It’s time to 
embrace data visualizations.
This chapter looks at different types of charts and their 
use. You need to know which charts are best for begin­
ners and which ones to avoid.
Deciding Which Charts to Use and 
When to Use Them
The purpose of a chart is to package information 
in a way that makes it quickly understandable. The 
thing that makes charts so useful is that they provide 
a quickly recognizable shape for your data. Think about 
that for a moment. Each graph you create has its own 
shape that is dictated by the data inside it. It’s a visual expla­
nation of a story.
A good chart can be understood at a glance. The information is communi­
cated by telling you, for example, whether something is going up or going 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
down — for example, whether prices are rising or falling. If you want to 
know whether a widget is selling, you can consult a chart that shows the 
trend line.
Understanding where newbies should start
When you’re new to a subject, you seek guidelines that help you master the 
content. Creating charts is no exception. Here are a few rules to get you off to 
a fast start:
	
✓	Employ simplicity. Simplicity is the key to creating effective data visual­
izations. You should focus on using simple charts that are easy to digest. 
You won’t get points for most amount of data displayed.
	
✓	Display only the most important information. When you’re new to 
charting, you may want to put in a lot of information so that you don’t 
leave out anything of value. Resist this urge, because people can take in 
only so much information before their eyes glaze over.
	
✓	Require little explanation. Don’t make things so complicated that your 
users require a manual to understand what you’re trying to convey. 
If you can’t get something at a glance, it’s too complicated for your 
reader.
	
✓	Don’t overload your data. It’s important to avoid overloading your data 
visualization, but the trend toward the use of mobile devices makes this 
practice even more important. Mobile devices reduce the screen real 
estate to almost half of what’s available on a desktop. Typically, a visual­
ization isn’t manipulated on a mobile phone; it’s only viewed.
	
✓	Stay away from 3-D. At some point in your data career, you may 
become a whiz at depicting charts in 3-D. We recommend that you 
avoid this type of chart, however, until you get more experience under 
your belt.
Next, you want to know what elements make up a good chart so that you can 
incorporate those elements:
	
✓	Labels: Labels are so important, yet many people forget to add them. 
Whether it’s the title of the chart, the chart legend, or the labels for the 
axes, letting users know what is being displayed is vital. Users typically 
look at the title of a chart before the actual chart, so be aware that you 
need one.
	
✓	Color: Choosing the correct colors for your chart is critical. Whether 
you are displaying different quantities or pointing out specific measures, 
choosing appropriate colors is an absolute must. At a glance, most users 
are likely to focus on brighter colors first, sometimes completely over­
looking less highlighted colors, such as gray. Strategically using the right 
colors in your chart guides your users and adds value by enabling them 
to decide what to focus on first.

 Chapter 4: Using Charts Effectively
	
✓	Chart Type: Choosing the correct chart to tell the story of your data 
is quite a challenge. It’s not surprising that the use of pie charts is so 
highly debated. Many newbies tend to go with what makes their data 
look pretty, often choosing the wrong chart for the wrong reasons. 
There are, in fact, very specific uses for the different chart styles, 
many of which are covered in this chapter.
	
	Figure 4-1 shows how you might set up a chart to display some data on 
the x- and y-axes. In the figure, each axis is clearly labeled in its correct 
position.
Figure 4-1: A simple chart with an appropriate title and axis labels.
	
✓	Labels: Users have to know what they’re seeing at a glance. Make sure to 
include labels for everything that isn’t readily apparent.
	
Always include the source of the data at the bottom of the chart if the chart 
will be viewed outside your company. Read more about copyrights in 
Chapter 11.
Choosing simple and effective charts
Although you have many chart types to choose among, we recommend 
starting with some of the simple and most commonly used charts for the 
most chance for success: bar and column charts, line charts, and pie charts. 
No doubt you’re familiar with them and have seen many examples. In the 
following sections, we discuss these chart types and show you when to 
use them.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
Bar and column charts
Some people use the term bar chart when speaking about a chart that shows 
the data horizontally or vertically; others call a chart that displays the data 
vertically a column chart. Whatever you call them, these charts are best used 
for comparisons.
Figure 4-2 shows an example of a column chart. (You can also see the image at 
http://www.smartdraw.com/examples/view/future+wealth+holde
r%27s+gender+shift+bar+chart.) Notice that the chart is simple, with a 
title, a labeled axis, and clear labels to show what the columns represent.
	
When you use a column chart, be sure to shorten or use smaller labels on 
your x-axis below each bar to ensure they display horizontally. Utilizing 
longer labels will result in needing to display the title vertically (as shown in 
Figure 4-2), which is hard for the user to read.
Line charts
A line chart connects data points over a period of time, as shown in 
Figure 4-3. (You can also find the image at http://www.smartdraw.com/
examples/view/cost+of+crude+oil+line+chart.)
Line charts are best used for something like a trend to show movement. 
These charts are easy to read and fairly easy to create. This type of chart 
should be one of your staples.
Pie charts
The use of pie charts is controversial, and the debate is more than a decade 
old. Just type the words avoid pie chart in a search engine, and you’ll 
literally find more than 1 million entries. One of the best-known data

 Chapter 4: Using Charts Effectively
design experts, Edward Tufte, refers to pie charts as “dumb” in his book 
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Graphics Press). Tufte argues 
that pie charts are dumb because they fail to show comparisons and trends 
as well as bar or line charts do. Many experts argue that the eyes are not 
good at estimating areas, which you must do when viewing a pie chart.
Although we agree with the main argument that the human eye isn’t very 
good at estimating areas, it’s hard to ignore the fact that pie charts remain 
among the most beloved types of charts. We believe that it’s primarily 
because of their round shape.
The more you tell data visualization authors to avoid pie charts, the more 
they want to use them, either because their users request them or because 
they hope to add some variety to their visualizations.
We believe that you can indeed use pie charts as effective data visualizations 
if — and only if — you stick to the purpose they were meant to serve and 
follow the guidelines we provide in this section.
By definition, pie charts are circular charts divided into slices, with the size 
of each slice showing the relative value. In other words, at a glance, it should 
be easy to see which slices of the pie contribute the most and least to the 
whole pie. Well, it’s not quite as easy as you may think.
Take a look at the two most common ways pie charts are misused:
	
✓	Too many slices are displayed. We recommend that you limit the number 
of pie slices to five. Displaying additional slices that are too small to be 
sorted will only distract the user from the main point. Figure 4-4 shows a 
pie chart displaying how much (by percentage) each revenue stream has 
contributed to the company’s overall revenue in the last quarter.
Figure 4-3: Line chart.

	At a glance, it’s clear that T-shirts, capris, and baseball caps combined 
account for 90 percent of the company’s sales. What isn’t so clear are 
the products that make up the remaining 10 percent of the revenue.
	
	Figure 4-5 shows a better way to display the same data. Notice that the 
other products are combined in a slice titled Other. This makes the chart 
easier to digest. You highlight the top contributors and show the contri­
butions of the additional slices as a single sector.
	
✓	Slices of equal value are displayed. This is another common mistake. The 
pie chart in Figure 4-5 has fewer than five slices, but because the value of 
some of the slices are relatively the same, it’s hard to compare the actual 
contribution of those individual slices relative to another one another.
	
	Figure 4-6 displays the same data from Figure 4-5 in a column chart that 
has been set to sort in ascending order.
	
	Notice how much easier it is to see which products have contributed the 
most revenue, even if the differences in some of the values are very slim?

combined into the Other group.

Figure 4-6: The data is sorted in ascending order.
	
Unless you’re developing static data visualizations such as infographics or a 
yearly report in which the data isn’t updated dynamically, avoid using pie 
charts. The reality is that most Big Data visualizations are going to be 
updated dynamically from some real-time database, making it nearly impossi­
ble to control the data output. The risk of breaking one, if not both, of the 
rules of pie charts we provide in this section is very high; ultimately, the 
risk isn’t worth making the data hard to read.
Using gauges and scorecards to monitor
Here’s a question you probably thought you wouldn’t see in this chapter on 
using charts: Do you always need to create a chart for your data? The answer is 
“Not always.” You can use other devices instead, such as a gauge or scorecard. 
People are familiar with gauges because we use them in everyday life. You glance 
at your car’s gas gauge to determine how much gas you have, for example.
In data visualizations, gauges are often used to monitor the status of key per­
formance indicators or something with known data parameters. If you know 
the lowest and highest measurements, you can use tick marks to 
Who created these charts?
You may not have thought about it before, but 
somebody had to invent the first bar, line, and 
pie charts. That person was William Playfair, a 
Scottish engineer who used the first pie chart 
in 1801. If you want to impress your friends with 
trivia, this item is useful to know.

display them and use a pointer to show where the data is at the present time. 
Figure 4-7 shows examples of how gauges are used to display data. (See the 
image at www.infragistics.com/help/topic/780FF79B-3E5A-40B3-
9AA3-3EB8A2683798.)
Just like pie charts, gauges have their critics. Some people believe that a 
gauge doesn’t provide historical data, so it’s not as useful as it could be. The 
same is true for scorecards.
Considered to be a separate form of data visualization altogether (depend­
ing on the source), scorecards are also used to monitor measurements. As 
opposed to a gauge, which is limited to monitoring a single measurement, a 
single scorecard can monitor multiple measurements at the same time, which 
makes it more useful to more users. Figure 4-8 show how a scorecard 
can be used to view sales data across two quarters (see the image at 
www.otusanalytics.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/
salesRepPerformanceScorecard.png).

Dipping Into Less-Common Charts
We’ve provided a clear list of charts to stick with if you’re new to charting. 
We use the KISS acronym, which means “Keep It Simple, Superstar!” We real­
ize, however, that you’ll get bored using the same vanilla charts, as we all do, 
and you’ll want to make your data visualization “sexy” by venturing into more 
exotic chart territory.
	
While you’re trying to find sexier charts to display your data, it’s important 
to keep in mind that the ultimate goal of any data visualization is to take a 
huge data set and display intelligence data in the form of charts, text, and 
other visual elements that are easy for the user to digest.
Here are three common chart types that lure newbies with their sex appeal 
but provide little to no value to readers, who are often confused by them:
	
✓	Radar charts: Also known as spider or star charts because of their 
appearance, radar charts are designed to plot the values of different 
categories along a separate axis that starts from the center and ends 
in the outer ring, as shown in Figure 4-9.
	
	Although this cobweb of a chart definitely adds some sex appeal to your 
Big Data visualization, most users have no idea how to read the data. 
They get confused trying to decipher it without some accompanying 
text. We advise sticking to a bar or column chart instead.
	
✓	Candlestick charts: Candlestick charts were invented for the stock 
market and are used to describe the price movements of derivatives, 
securities, or currency over time. Stock-market data is the only type of 
data for which this chart type should be used. Understanding when a 
candlestick is high or low isn’t a concept that most readers are familiar 
with, so this type of chart will only serve to confuse them.

(You can find the image at www.visifire.com/documentation/
Visifire_Documentation/Charts/Common_Tasks/creating_
candlestick_chart_using_axisxlabel.htm.)
	
✓	Waterfall charts: These charts display the effect of positive and nega­
tive changes on a specific value over time. Waterfall charts are nick­
named “flying bricks” because they appear to be flying in midair.
	
	Figure 4-11 shows a typical waterfall chart displaying financial profit/loss 
data. Colors on the bars indicate a negative or positive change in value, 
so you can easily see the $100,000 plunge that the company’s profit took 
(from $420,000 to $320,000) and all the contribution costs in between.

 Chapter 4: Using Charts Effectively
	
We recommend that you avoid using radar and candlestick charts. On the 
other hand, we advise using waterfall charts after you’ve mastered the simple 
charts we recommend earlier in this chapter. Waterfall charts aren’t all bad, 
and their meaning isn’t difficult for users to discern. When you do decide to 
use these charts, we highly recommend putting some text at the bottom to 
help readers who are encountering this type of chart for the first time.
	
Don’t get carried away trying to fit your data into a sexy chart. Instead, focus 
on the message you’re trying to convey. Charts were made for data; data 
wasn’t made for charts. The message of your data should always dictate the 
charts you use. If you choose a sexy chart and then try to fit in data, you 
almost always confuse users, which lowers user adoption.

emember the saying “A picture is worth a thousand words”? Well, 
although this saying may hold true for museum art, it doesn’t apply to 
most data visualizations. One of the main reasons why users request data 
visualizations is to get away from tons of reports with loads of data and text 
that either take too long to interpret or are too difficult to understand.
If you want to create truly powerful data visualizations, adding some context 
in the form of text is one of the most effective ways to communicate your 
data. Take a stop sign, for example. Have you ever noticed that 
besides the unique shape and color of it, the text STOP is right 
in the middle? (See Figure 5-1.) Globally this is probably 
one of the most recognized signs — identifiable just 
by its shape and color. The text on the sign text just 
makes it that much easier to recognize what the sign 
is telling you. There is no room for misinterpreta­
tion; the stop sign is a good example of using text to 
add smart context to a visualization.
You should apply the same practice to your data 
visualizations. You shouldn’t make the assumption 
that a visualization that’s clear to one user will be as 
clear to 100 other users. This is where adding some 
context to your data visualization becomes important. 
Adding context in the form of text is a foolproof way to 
ensure that all your users get the same message.

Adding any form of text to data visualizations may seem to be counterintui­
tive, but this chapter shows you that with the right application, text can 
be a powerful addition to any data visualization. The chapter also explores 
the notion of text analysis, because applying it to your data visualization 
may make the difference between displaying intelligent data and displaying 
useless data.

 Chapter 5: Adding a Little Context
Making Text Useful
One of the easiest ways to add context to any data visualization is to add text 
on or around a given visualization. Although you have an infinite number of 
ways to do this, this chapter focuses on a few specific techniques that make 
the process simple.
Before you go crazy adding text to your visuals, however, you should adhere 
to certain rules to avoid cluttering your visuals:
	
✓	Use as few words as possible. Text added to any data visualization 
must be complementary. Space is usually very limited, so your goal is 
to explain your visual with as few words as possible. E-mail marketers 
do this all the time, sometimes spending hours or even days on a single 
subject line, hoping to gain the highest e-mail open rate possible. The 
open rate is calculated by expressing the number of e-mails opened as a 
percentage of total e-mails.
	
	This process usually requires careful word choices, consideration of 
the limited space available in a single line, and multiple split tests to 
confirm the effectiveness of the chosen subject line. Done correctly, 
the process can increase e-mail open rates astronomically. The same 
is true of adding a line or two of text to a given data visualization. 
Done correctly, it can virtually eliminate misinterpretation of 
the data.
	
	Split testing is a marketing method that splits e-mail subscribers into 
two groups. Each group is sent a separate e-mail that is then tracked 
and compared based on specific metrics. The one with the better 
metrics is used.
	
✓	Stick to simple words or single characters. Using simple words is the 
key to providing your users an at-a-glance understanding of your visual 
and accompanying text. Say that a number has “gone up” or use an up 
arrow (↑) instead of saying that something has “increased,” or say that 
something is “bad” rather than “negative.” These examples present 
information in a way that’s easy for anyone to digest.
	
	Simplicity is key when it comes to choosing words.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
	
	Avoid using acronyms that require some existing knowledge or addi­
tional action to interpret.
	
✓	Use single lines of text. Besides keeping text simple, you need to keep 
it short. Just the sight of multiple lines of text may make a user hesitant 
to start reading that text. Your goal should be to use a single line of text 
that’s easy to read and interpret.
	
✓	Apply color sparingly. Although adding RAG (red, amber, and green) 
alert colors can be useful, adding random colors to make text stand out 
against your visuals isn’t a good idea. In general, data visualizations 
are color-rich, and adding text in a color that contrasts with the visual 
causes the text to compete with the visual. When you’re a beginner, try 
to stick to text colors such as black, blue, and gray. Read more about 
using color in Chapter 10.
	
	Colors are used as alert colors in data visualizations. Think of a traffic 
light: Red means “Stop, something is wrong!”; yellow means “Proceed, 
but with caution!”; and green means “Go, everything is OK!.”
	
✓	Know your data. One cardinal rule about adding any form of text to 
describe a visualization is to make sure that the text applies to every 
scenario of the data being displayed — especially if the data is dynamic. 
This means that you can’t include a static set of text for only one sce­
nario of the data visualization, because the text won’t be applicable 
when the data changes along with the scenario. This situation is where 
dynamic text comes in handy. You can read more about dynamic text in 
“Exploring Text Analysis,” later in this chapter.
Now that you know the five main rules for adding text to data visualizations, 
it’s time to explore a few techniques for applying those rules effectively.
Adding text labeling
The quickest way to apply text to any data visualization is to add labels. 
Labels describe what the user is seeing. They’re easy to use, easy to read, 
and easy to apply.
Table 5-1 lists three types of text labels that you can add to any data 
visualization.

 Chapter 5: Adding a Little Context
Table 5-1	
Text Label Types
Label Type
Description
Title
Usually placed at the top of, inside, or alongside a specific visual. 
The title describes what the visual is displaying — Economic 
Growth in 2012, for example. Some higher-level titles may 
describe a section that includes multiple visuals.
Description
Normally located alongside or below a specific visual. These 
labels use a single word, text fragment, or sentence to describe 
the behavior of the visual. A good description sums up the mes­
sage of any data scenario in a single sentence.
Value
May include a single number, letter, or combination of both in or 
on a given visual. The label usually stands alone or refers to a 
specific part of the visualization. A single visualization may have 
multiple values.
	
Most good data visualizations include all three types of labels.
	
Labels should be strategically positioned (see the next section), sized, and 
worded so that the text complements the visuals without overshadowing 
them. Going overboard with text can lead to something your users will see as 
just another report with some visuals.
Considering text positioning
You may have heard the saying “It’s all about where you place it,” which 
could not be truer when it comes to adding text to data visualizations. 
Wrongly placed text can lead to misinterpretation of the data.
You should follow two best practices in placing text on your data 
visualizations:
	
✓	Keep all text horizontal. Nonhorizontal text may confuse some of 
your potential users. We strongly advise that you stay away from 
positioning your text vertically or diagonally. Never force a user to 
tilt “his” or “her” head to read something! Stick to the basics by keeping 
all text horizontal.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
	
	Keep in mind that text is included to complement the visual, not 
overshadow or complicate it.
	
✓	Keep all text within range of the visual. The human eye naturally asso­
ciates any text within a few centimeters of it as being related to it. In 
general, ensure that all text is within the range of the visual it’s related 
to, because positioning text too far from the targeted visual can lead to 
confusion.
	
	Figure 5-2 shows two basic bar charts. Both charts have a title label 
(refer to Table 5-1, earlier in this chapter), which is one of the most 
intuitive and common uses of text in any data visualization. The 
chart on the left has an easy-to-read horizontal label; the chart on 
the right has the same label tilted. Do you have to tilt your head 
to read the chart on the right? That label might be mistaken for an 
axis label.
Choosing text fonts
Choosing the perfect text font for any given data visualization can be a tricky 
process. Although increasing the size of a word may convey emphasis or 
importance, it’s not always the best route as it may overshadow the visuals.

 Chapter 5: Adding a Little Context
Font sizes and formats
Here are some ideas to consider when you choose font sizes and formats:
	
✓	Make important text a little bigger. A general rule of thumb is that 
low-hierarchy text should be in a smaller font than high-hierarchy text. 
Figure 5-3 shows how the font sizes of various labels in a hierarchy may 
vary based on level.
	
✓	Consistency is key. If you decide that all your main titles will be in a 
size 30 font, for example, you must ensure that all your main titles are 
exactly the same size.
	
	The key factor is to have consistency for each individual label type. 
Consistent label sizes for each level are easy for users to grasp, and the 
sizes help users identify certain areas of your data visualization at a 
glance.
	
✓	Avoid using all caps. The era of text messages and social media has cre­
ated a new set of rules for using text. Today, using all caps indicates that 
someone is shouting, which usually evokes hostility and defensiveness. 
All caps are also harder to read, as all the letters are the same size. In 
addition, readers may gloss over or skip all-caps words.
	
	It may be fine to use a simple all-caps title such as SALES EXECUTIVE 
DASHBOARD, but don’t use all caps in labels throughout your data 
visualization. In general, you have very little to gain from using all caps, 
so it’s best to avoid the practice.
Font types
Thanks to web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, most 
people have become accustomed to a few standard fonts, such as Verdana, 
Garamond, Arial, Helvetica, and Times New Roman.
Figure 5-3: Fonts vary in size based on level.

60
Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
These fonts are somewhat boring, but we highly recommend sticking to one 
or more of them, for two reasons:
	
✓	Each user’s web browser may be different. Data visualizations are 
commonly hosted on company sites or portals that must be viewed in 
a web browser (unless, of course, you’re developing a static image like 
an infographic). No matter what fonts you use to create a data viz, each 
user’s web browser automatically defaults displaying any text using one 
or more of the browser-safe fonts mentioned earlier.
	
	If you use unusual fonts, your visualization may look distorted or 
become unreadable when your fonts are replaced with browser-safe 
fonts. It’s safer to design your visualization with the common fonts.
	
	One way to get around having to use browser-safe fonts is by posting 
your visualization in an Adobe PDF or Microsoft PowerPoint format. 
These file types are not affected by the browser, but these options are 
not available in all tools.
	
✓	Avoid fancy or custom fonts. Using fancy or custom fonts may make it 
harder for someone else to understand or edit your data viz, especially 
if you use nonstandard or specialized fonts that need to be individually 
downloaded and installed on a desktop. Yes, custom fonts may look 
great, but they are simply not worth the risk of having the user not being 
able to view them.
	
We recommend using Verdana and Garamond, both of which are on the 
extended list of browser-safe fonts. They add a little bit of flair without having 
the straight military feel of Arial.
Choosing text color
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, you should choose a font color that’s 
easy to read, such as black, gray, or dark blue. You should use this color 
scheme consistently throughout your data visualizations. The last thing you 
want is a bunch of color-rich visuals that are accompanied by colorful text; 
users would have a hard time deciphering what’s important!
Consider a few guidelines when choosing text colors:
	
✓	Consistency is king. This won’t be the last time we’ll tell you to be con­
sistent. Maintaining consistency of font color for specific label types is 
an absolute must. If you choose to put all descriptions in a dark gray 
color, then it’s important that all descriptions receive this same treat­
ment. Newbies often get the urge to change the color of particular text in 
an effort to bring more attention to it. They don’t take into consideration 
how the change affects the entire data visualization. Avoid falling into 
the trap of using too many colors.

61
 Chapter 5: Adding a Little Context
	
✓	RAG colors are sacred. The use of red, amber, and green in all data 
visualizations is sacred, especially in the financial world. When it comes 
to data visualizations, these colors are automatically interpreted as 
meaning that something has gone wrong (red), something is about to 
go wrong (yellow), and everything is fine (green). These alert colors are 
used in data visualizations to provide notification when a measurement 
is heading to a good or bad status. When it comes to text, you should 
use only RAG colors to indicate alerts.
	
✓	Bright colors are hard to read. What happens when you see a neon-
colored sign? It definitely captures your attention at first. But imagine 
having to look at the same sign every day! After a short period, you find 
that the sign isn’t as easy to look at as it was when it first caught your 
attention. For this reason, avoid using bright-colored text in your data 
visualizations. Over time, muted colors will prove to be much easier for 
your users to read.
	
	In some situations, however, a specialized color is required. See 
Chapter 10 for more information about those situations, which occur at 
a later stage in your data visualization journey.
Exploring Text Analysis
One of the most powerful ways to add context to your data visualizations 
is to include text analysis. In the Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula 
world (BIDF; see Chapter 1), text analysis is defined as a short sentence or 
fragment that contains a combination of static text and dynamic values that 
describe one or more visualizations.
Figure 5-4 shows a simple text analysis. The underlined words are dynamic, 
which means that they change based on the behavior of the data.
Avoid data overload
Mainstream advertisers often use the term data 
overload to scare the user community. Just type 
data overload in a search engine, and you’ll see 
a series of data visualization software choices 
that are guaranteed to help even the most 
novice of users avoid the dreaded data over­
load syndrome by supposedly automating the 
generation of “useful” data visualizations! This 
promise is often an advertising ploy, though, so 
it’s very important not to fall for this marketing 
trap.
A good rule of thumb is to ensure that your text-
to-visuals ratio is 1:5, which means that you limit 
the use of text to roughly 20 percent of your 
overall data visualization. This ratio is a surefire 
way to ensure that you add value rather than 
clutter to your data viz.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
Think of text analysis as being a real-time description of what’s happening 
with the data. As the data changes, so does the descriptor. The trick is to 
create a statement that’s smart enough to suit all scenarios of the data as it 
changes. Let’s take a closer look at Figure 5-4 and how we built it.
First, you must know the data, as we mentioned earlier when we sug­
gested rules you should follow for producing uncluttered visuals. For 
instance, in the example in Figure 5-4, we know that the chart is displaying 
expenses on a monthly basis. Therefore we establish the static parts of 
our sentence:
(ALERT): Expenses (dynamic text #1) monthly budget by (dynamic
 text #2).
Next you establish all the possible scenarios of the dynamic text (marked 
as blanks in the preceding example). In the case of Figure 5-4, we know that 
the possibilities for dynamic text #1 are that the expenses can exceed, not 
change, or remain below the monthly budget. Hence this sentence could have 
three different scenarios:
	
✓	Scenario #1: ALERT: Expenses (have exceeded) monthly budget by 
(dynamic text #2).
	
✓	Scenario #2: ALERT: Expenses (have not changed) monthly budget by 
(dynamic text #2).
	
✓	Scenario #3: ALERT: Expenses (remain below) monthly budget by 
(dynamic text #2).
Lastly, we need to fill in dynamic text #2. To calculate that rate for scenarios 
1 and 3, we do a simple formula to find out by what percentage the expenses 
exceed or are below the budget.

changes with the data.

 Chapter 5: Adding a Little Context
Be sure to note the importance of not only covering all scenarios of the 
data but also changing the wording as needed to ensure the sentence 
makes sense. This is obviously a simple example, but it’s a great place to 
start!
Determining what makes text analysis so important
When they first view a data visualization, most users do a two-part analysis. 
At first glance, they scan the visuals to get a sense of how the measurement 
is performing. Then, if time permits, they take a closer look at each visual to 
try to interpret what they’re seeing. Their brains do a series of scans, captur­
ing numbers, words, and colors to gain a clear idea of the message that the 
data is conveying.
You can use text analysis to eliminate this two-part process, however, by pro­
viding users with everything that they need to know in a single glance.
Text analysis serves two important purposes:
	
✓	It prevents misinterpretation. If 50 people see a single visualization, 
chances are that none of them will interpret the visualization exactly the 
same way. By providing text analysis, you essentially help users inter­
pret the visualization clearly and make informed decisions.
	
✓	It saves time. Providing a clear, text-based interpretation of what a 
visual portrays saves users time, because they no longer have to 
stare closely at the visualization to gain a deeper understanding of 
the data.
Building a text analysis statement
How do you build a text analysis statement? Over the years, we’ve broken 
down thousands of text analysis statements and discovered that most of 
them contain the same four elements:
	
✓	What: This element refers to what you’re actually measuring and usually 
is some form of key performance indicator or metric. Sales, expenses, 
margin, performance, and retention are all examples of measurements 
that you include at the beginning of your statement to let the user know 
what you’re referring to.

64
Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
	
✓	What happened: This element describes the behavior of the metric 
and uses measurement terms such as high, low, up, down, increasing, or 
decreasing. This behavior can also be represented with symbols, such as 
arrows.
	
✓	By how much: This element describes the magnitude of change in some 
numerical value.
	
	Gauging the magnitude of any change is one of the best use cases for 
text analysis.
	
✓	When: A good guideline (when possible) is to include some reference to 
a time period to enable the user to gauge the effect of the change.
Figure 5-5 shows two simple text analysis statements that describe the same 
chart. Notice that the underlined dynamic words change as the data in the 
chart changes.

In This Chapter
▶	Knowing how people see design
▶	Communicating with pattern layouts
▶	Selecting a template
▶	Designing for different devices
T

his chapter examines the way that people see and digest information. If 
you familiarize yourself with the common design conventions described 
in this chapter, you’ll find it easier to create powerful visualizations that con­
tain intelligent (actionable) data. In this chapter we look at principles that 
make up what is called “Gestalt” theory. It defines how what we see is trans­
lated into meaning. All the actions required to make meaning of things hap­
pens in our brains when we view things based on size and position.
This chapter also discusses the specific patterns that 
people use when viewing information. If you are aware 
of these patterns, you can more effectively structure 
your information. In addition, you see how to use a 
template to build on the knowledge of designers 
who have already thought through the issues you 
are facing as you build your data viz. Finally you 
look at the issues involved in designing for mobile 
devices and how that relates to the creation of your 
data viz.
Uncovering How People Digest Data
Recent advances in cognitive science have made it possible 
to scan the human brain and understand what happens when 
people view something. Researchers have learned more about the brain in 
the past ten years than they did in the previous hundred, which has made it 
possible to analyze brain function in exciting new ways.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
Think about how we see. Our eyes gather information in small chunks, for 
example, even though we think we’re seeing everything as a whole. When 
you’re reading, your eyes take in several words, your brain makes mental 
pictures, and then your eyes move on to the next chunk of text. This process 
happens so quickly that you’re unaware of it.
You may think that web designers create user experiences based solely on 
intuition and imagination. But believe it or not, today’s designers adhere to 
Gestalt theory, which are principles uncovered by German psychologists in 
the early 20th century.
Gestalt means unified whole in English and is generally associated with the 
idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Gestalt theory is 
made up of several principles — including the concepts of proximity, similar­
ity, closure, continuation, and figure/ground — that describe how the human 
brain sees visual information. Designers who understand this theory can 
develop visuals that communicate information in the most effective ways. 
We discuss each of these principles in turn.
	
Gestalt theory guides good designers when they create visualizations. You 
should also use the theory when you design your own data viz. You’ll proba­
bly be surprised to find that you intuitively know the principles of Gestalt 
theory, which makes them even more powerful.
Here’s how each principle influences what people see:
	
✓	Proximity: When items are placed in close proximity, people assume 
that they’re in the same group because they’re close to one another and 
apart from other groups. Figure 6-1 shows a visualization that includes 
grouped items. You can see the original image at www.socialnomics.

 Chapter 6: Paying Attention to Detail
	
✓	Similarity: When items look the same, people perceive them to be of 
the same type. We naturally assume that shapes that look the same are 
related. When you create a data viz and you keep items together that 
look the same, you make it easy for someone to understand that those 
items represent a group.
	
✓	Closure: Our eyes tend to add any missing pieces of a familiar shape. If 
two sections are taken out of a circle, as shown in Figure 6-2, people still 
perceive the whole circle.

they see them as continuing to move that way. Figure 6-3 shows an example.

✓	Figure/ground: Depending on how people look at a picture, they see 
either the figure (foreground) or the ground (background) as standing 
out, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Presenting Common Visual Patterns
When you begin to create visualizations, you may be concerned about the 
placement of your charts, graphs, and other key data. Because you are 
new to data visualization, you may feel that you don’t have accumulated 
knowledge about what works and what doesn’t. Some reasons you may feel 
concerned include the following:
	
✓	You aren’t sure about the placement of each element in the chart.
	
✓	You aren’t clear about who your users will be for the data viz.
	
✓	You don’t know where to put your menu items so they will be seen.
Fortunately, cognitive scientists have determined that people read text and 
images in certain specific patterns. As you organize the information in your 
visualization, using these standard patterns helps your users to scan the 
information quickly and easily.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
Z and F patterns
Here are the two most common visual patterns:
	
✓	Z pattern: The Z pattern is often used for text and visual layouts. As 
you would expect, when a person’s eyes follow the Z pattern, his 
eyes track from left to right across the top, down to the left, and then 
across the page at the bottom. Figure 6-5 shows the points of the 
Z numbered in the order in which the reader’s eyes track across 
information on a page.
	
	How does this pattern affect the layout of your content in a visualiza­
tion? Your reader will scan the content along the path of the Z, so you 
should place the title at the top of the Z, along with any key content. 
Position more visual content in the middle and along the bottom.
	
✓	F pattern: Cognitive scientists have created heat maps to determine where 
the human eye goes when it looks at a web page. As shown in Figure 6-6, 
heat maps are composed of concentrations of colors that show where 
readers scanned the page. The most intense colors (red and yellow) show 
Figure 6-5: The Z pattern.

the blue areas. As you can see, the red and yellow areas resemble an F.

✓	Balance: When you place items in your visualization, be sure to maintain 
balance. When too many items are clustered together, it’s difficult for 
people to see how those items are related.
	
✓	Color: Random use of colors such as red can be misleading, causing the 
viewer to see an alert when there’s no cause for alarm. Read Chapter 10 
for more about using color in your visualizations.
	
✓	Hierarchy: You’re familiar with the use of hierarchy as it pertains to a 
text outline. The top level of the outline may have a Roman numeral, 
the next level may have a capital letter, and then the third level may 
have a number. In a visualization, you can tell based on size or position 
which items are higher or lower on the hierarchy. You don’t need to 
use numbering as you do in a written outline.
	
✓	Repetition: Repetition helps people become familiar with the items in 
a design. If you use the same elements throughout, people see a unified 
whole and don’t have to guess what certain elements mean because 
they’ve seen those elements before.
	
✓	White space: The use of white space has been championed for 
decades. White space allows content to “breathe” — that is, your 
image benefits from ample space around the objects in the visualiza­
tion. Too much clutter makes it hard for people to take in the image at 
a glance.
Deciding to Use a Template
Templates have become popular because they help novice designers use the 
expertise of more experienced designers. A template is a guide that helps you 
to create something using a model designed by others.
Many people feel that templates are confining because you have to place the 
objects in the spot that’s been designated for them. In reality, though, tem­
plates are freeing, because they ensure that you create a balanced layout but 
still allow you to add your own look and feel. Here are some other benefits of 
templates:
	
✓	Quick start: Rather than sitting and puzzling over where to place your 
charts, numbers, and objects, you can begin to place those objects as 
designated by your template.
	
✓	Expert design: A template lets you draw on the skills of trained experts, 
which is a benefit if you’re not a designer (and sometimes even if you 
are). There’s clearly no downside to following the advice of people who 
are more skilled in an area than you are.
	
✓	Cost savings: Using a template enables you to forgo the services of 
a designer (although you may want to use a designer for complex 
projects).

Achieving Consistency across Devices
As the popularity of mobile devices has increased, designers have had to face 
two new design issues:
	
✓	Design of mobile device interfaces
	
✓	Creation of apps for mobile devices
Until a few years ago, when a designer created a paper-based ad or brochure, 
she could plan exactly how it would look after it was printed. The designer 
knew the format and how customers would view it.
With the advent of the Internet, online designers used the few web browsers 
that were available to plan how their designs would look onscreen. The avail­
able tools were somewhat crude, but design was pretty straightforward. If he 
tested each web browser, a designer could determine what he needed to fix 
so the design would look right online.
Now designers have to design for a host of mobile devices, each of which has 
its own quirky needs. Consequently, the complexities of designing visualiza­
tions have grown.
Where less is more
Throughout this chapter, we talk about ways 
to incorporate design to make visualiza­
tions better. Restrictions can be good ways to 
improve your design. Think about how you’re 
limited by space, for example. When you know 
that you can put only a few items in a data viz, 
you’re forced to think harder about what is 
necessary.
Other design concepts follow the idea that 
less is more. Too many colors or typefaces 
are distracting, for example. Many designers 
like to limit the use of typefaces to two. Being 
familiar with design guidelines can help you 
avoid having a design that closely resembles a 
ransom note.

Part II: Mastering Basic Data Visualization Concepts 
Embracing responsive design
To deal with the issue of multiple screen sizes and operating systems, design­
ers use the principle of responsive design (RD). RD refers to an interface or 
layout that can reconfigure itself based on where it’s being viewed. The term 
was coined by Ethan Marcotte in a 2010 article (http://alistapart.com/
article/responsive-web-design) that recognized the need for design­
ers to address the issue of multiple screen requirements.
A website design that’s responsive still looks good whether you view it on 
your desktop computer or on your smartphone. The rounded edges and 
icons that are common on smaller devices automatically fall into place.
In his article, Marcotte cited the three areas where RD can have the most 
effect in web design:
	
✓	Fluid grids: The grid is the tool that designers use to lay out their designs, 
regardless of whether those designs will be viewed online or offline. In 
Figure 6-7, a grid design has been transformed for three screen shapes. 
(You can find the original image at http://searchengineland.com/
figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/06/responsive-design-
alone-not-mobile-seo.png.)
	
✓	Flexible images: When you have images in a blog post or on your 
website, you want to ensure that they’re not cut off or distorted. 
Making sure that your images can reformat themselves is important.
	
✓	Media queries: When you enter a search term in a search engine such 
as Google or Bing, you want to be able to view the results on any of your 
screens. This is a key principle of RD. The content needs to be viewed

 Chapter 6: Paying Attention to Detail
on any mobile device a user might have. What makes viewing it on a 
variety of devices a challenge is that the designer has no way to know 
what the returned result will be.
These ideas apply to data visualizations as well. You want to make sure that 
your grid isn’t distorted when the data viz is viewed on a mobile device. 
The images must be clear, and the aspect ratio (length to width) should be 
aligned regardless of the device the user is working with.
Following app design standards
Designers not only want an interface to look good but also want it to do all 
sorts of tricks. As a result, app design has become a discipline unto itself.
You may wonder why you should care about app design. Everyone who has 
to visualize anything online is subject to the same standards as any app 
designer.
In his article “Apple’s 6 Simple Rules for Designing a Killer iOS App” 
(http://mashable.com/2012/12/20/spun-ios-design), Pete Pachal 
describes what he had to do to get his news app Spun certified for Apple’s 
App Store. (At this writing, the app isn’t available in the U.S. App Store.) 
Pachal’s team had to work with Apple for five months to get everything 
perfected. During that time, Pachal codified six rules for his team. We’ve 
singled out four of these rules that apply to data viz design:
	
✓	Simplicity is strength. This rule is probably the most important rule 
for data visualizations. The goal is to explain or uncover new informa­
tion that can be used to develop insights. If you focus on too many data 
points, the story will be lost. If you’re creating a dashboard, this rule is 
particularly important because each piece of data needs to support the 
whole. (As Gestalt theory says, the whole is greater than the sum of its 
parts. See “Uncovering How People Digest Data,” earlier in this chapter, 
for more about this theory.)
	
✓	Don’t sacrifice quality for time. This rule is important for data visualiza­
tion. If you slap together a visualization that’s hard to decipher or just 
plain sloppy, no one will want to use it. Take the time to develop 
something great, and continue to refine it over time.
	
✓	Reward the user with every touch. Every menu item should do some­
thing useful. The print link should work, for example. Also, every click 
should provide information.
	
✓	Details matter. Before the user clicks a link in a data visualization, it 
should be apparent where that link will take her or what type of data 
she’ll see.

▶	Choosing what to build
▶	Developing your first storyboard
W

hen you’re applying data visualization to Big Data, storytelling 
is perhaps one of the easiest ways to engage your audi­
ence. As social media continues to evolve, attention spans 
continue to reduce from minutes to seconds. As a result, 
complex reports and visualizations that require lots of 
deep analysis are losing their relevance. Hence, it’s 
critical that you develop the “correct” story.
This chapter provides an overview of the prac­
tice of using data visualizations to drive decision 
making and then covers all the steps to defining 
your first storyboard. We start with identifying the 
audience, documenting their key measures, and 
then finally putting those measure into a visual story­
board. Defining an easy-to-follow storyboard requires 
some homework, and this chapter shows you how to 
work through a series of steps using a proven methodology 
and templates.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Business Intelligence Overview
Did you know that there is an entire multi-billion-dollar industry that focuses 
on the practice of building and using analytics reports and data visualiza­
tions (usually referred to as dashboards) to drive the decision-making pro­
cess in large and small organizations? It’s called Business Intelligence (BI). BI 
involves creating any type of data visualization (report, dashboard, or info­
graphic) that provides insight into a business for the purpose of making 
a decision or taking an action.
Many people who are reading this book have been in the BI industry for many 
years without even realizing it. Whether you’ve been consuming some type 
of data for professional or personal use or building a report, dashboard, or 
infographic for others to use to make decisions, you’ve been part of the 
BI industry.
Now that you’re clear on the definition of BI, you’re probably wondering why 
BI is so important, especially if you’re not familiar with it. There are two rea­
sons why business intelligence should be important to anyone in the data 
visualization arena:
	
✓	BI drives industry trends. Trends in BI influence trends in many other 
areas, such as Big Data, mobility, social collaboration, and the cloud. 
These trends affect you as a data visualization consumer or creator, so 
it’s important that you stay abreast of trends in the BI industry.
	
	If you’re a consumer, for example, the rise of mobile and social collabo­
ration determines where you access data visualizations, how you inter­
act with them, and how you gain deeper insights from them.
	
✓	BI drives the evolution of data visualization tools. The BI industry is 
very competitive, and chances are that any tool you choose for building 
your data visualization will be classified as a BI tool. On one hand, this 
competition among different software vendors to build the ultimate tool 
works to everyone’s benefit. It drives innovation that focuses on ease-
of-use, better insight, and lower cost.
	
	On the other hand, the choice of tools is becoming so extensive that it’s 
sometimes hard to decide on the best tool for the job. Consider the most 
widely used BI tool in the world: Microsoft Excel. Some members of the 
BI industry suggest that Excel, despite its wide adoption, is the most 
dangerous and least effective tool available. It’s important to understand 
that the evolution of new software in this industry directly affects what 
types of tools are available to you.
After you have selected the right BI tools, it’s time to develop a storyboard 
that will help you display the data. Throughout the rest of the chapter, we 
discuss the steps you need to take to set up your storyboard.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
Delving Into Your Story
The most important step in building any data visualization is developing an 
easy-to-follow storyboard. In the BI community, storyboarding has a broad 
range of definitions.
For the purposes of this book, we use the Business Intelligence Dashboard 
Formula (BIDF) definition of storyboarding to keep it simple. This formula 
defines storyboarding as the act of translating user requirements into a 
four-part diagram that states the goal, measurements, and data visualization 
types. Using the BIDF storyboard, as shown in Figure 7-1, you can easily docu­
ment each section discussed in this chapter to develop your story.
The four main sections are
	
✓	Current State: Where are you now?
	
✓	Trends: How did you get here,?
	
✓	Forecast: Where will you end up?
	
✓	What-if: What can you change to achieve or exceed your goals?

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Uncovering storyboard content
Before creating your first storyboard, you must decide what will be in it. If 
you focus on creating an easy-to-follow storyboard composed of actionable, 
intelligent data that outlines a clear story, building your final data visualiza­
tion is fairly simple. First, you need to identify and document some key 
elements of your story by following these steps:
	
1.	Identify your audience.
	
	 Knowing your audience helps you quickly establish what kind of story­
board you’re building and understand how to approach gathering the 
users’ data and visual requirements.
	
	 If your audience is comprised of C-level executives (such as the CEO, CFO, 
CIO, and so) or senior managers (such as vice presidents), you should 
expect them to have very little time to examine great detail. Your resulting 
data visualization and key performance indicators (KPIs) must be very high 
level, summarized views that give a 360-degree view of the company or spe­
cific area while allowing the user to drill down for further details.
	
2.	Document the audience’s goals.
	
	 Gaining a clear understanding of your audience’s goals and existing pain 
points will help you determine what to include and — more importantly —
what not to include in the storyboard.
	
	
Our BIDF team once worked with the president of a sales division who 
was responsible for annual revenue of more than $6 billion at one of the 
largest consumer-food-goods companies in the world. He explained to us 
that his goal was to drive his organization toward a sales level that 
would enable the sales team to receive their bonuses. He explained with 
great confidence, “If we can just get our sales team to do that, every­
thing else will take care of itself.” We immediately knew that our story­
board would have to focus on the year-end sales team bonuses; anything 
that didn’t focus on helping the sales division hit its goal wouldn’t 
appear in the storyboard.
	
3.	Define the audience’s KPIs.
	
	 Understanding the key measurements that your audience must view, 
monitor, or track is the last step in developing your story. We recommend 
keeping your KPI count to fewer than 10 items combined because atten­
tion spans have gotten smaller, as has the average computer screen size!
	
	 Our BIDF team once worked for a global telecommunications company 
that does about $10 billion in sales across the Caribbean and Latin 
America. The company identified almost 400 KPIs at the start of the 
project, and our team was admittedly a bit intimidated. Using the BIDF 
methodology discussed in this book, however, after two weeks and some 
late-night scoping sessions, we reduced the KPIs to fewer than 20.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
Identifying your audience
The first step in developing a clear storyboard is identifying your audience. 
Who you’re building your data visualization for ultimately determines what 
kind of storyboard you develop and what level of data you display.
The easiest way to classify your audience is to look at two simple compo­
nents: line of business and job roles.
Line of business
Line of business (LOB) refers to an internal corporate business unit. The iden­
tified LOBs determine what kind of data to display. Human-resources data is 
very different from sales data, for example, in that it requires a lot of security 
and often the masking of sensitive employee data such as salary information.
Most big organizations have some of the following LOBs:
	
✓	Asset management
	
✓	Finance
	
✓	Human resources
	
✓	Information technology
	
✓	Manufacturing
	
✓	Marketing
	
✓	Procurement
	
✓	Research and development
	
✓	Engineering
	
✓	Sales
	
✓	Service
	
✓	Supply chain
	
✓	Sustainability
	
Although it’s common to have multiple LOBs in a single storyboard, we rec­
ommend using a maximum of two related LOBs per storyboard.
	
The “one data visualization fits everyone” approach is a common pitfall 
for data visualization newbies, who often find themselves with an unused 
data-rich Picasso, as shown in Figure 7-2.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Job roles
This category refers to the role of a person or group of people in a given LOB 
and their stake in the resulting data visualization. The job titles and stakes of 
your audience members directly affect the level of data you should display in 
your data visualization.
Table 7-1 shows some of the most common job roles within an organization. 
Levels may vary by company size.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
Documenting Goals
Now that you’ve clearly established your audience type, you need to identify 
and document the audience’s goals. The easiest way to do this may be to 
hold a small planning session that includes the executive sponsor (if there is 
one) and representatives of each job role in each LOB.
If the sales manager is requesting the data visualization, for example, it’s 
important that you have that sales manager present, as well as one or two 
members of her reporting team to ensure that all parties agree on the identi­
fied goals. Although in-person meetings are preferable, most global organiza­
tions find it challenging to do planning sessions in person. We recommend 
requesting a simple conference call.
	
Avoid sending e-mails to accomplish this task. You’ll only receive multiple, 
conflicting goals that take extensive time to track down and align with each 
job role.
	
Although goal gathering can appear to be a simple task, chances are that it 
will reveal conflicting agendas and priorities across different job roles. This is 
why it’s critical to have the executive sponsor or most senior job role present 
to dictate and align the goal of the data visualization. If a senior-level sponsor 
is missing, your audience members may be confused and may distance them­
selves from the rest of the process. This scenario is your worst nightmare. 
Don’t overlook this requirement.
To guide the goal-gathering process, ask each person present the following 
two questions, and be sure to document their individual answers:
	
✓	What are your problems and pain points today?
	
	Ask the audience members to focus on problems that can be fixed with 
a resolution that can be measured quantitatively. Here are examples of 
quantifiable and nonquantifiable problems:
	
• Quantifiable problem: If the sales manager states that sales are 
declining because too much money is being spent on old market­
ing campaigns that aren’t producing results anymore, an oppor­
tunity exists. You can review historical trends, identify declining 
campaigns, and reallocate the spending to boost high-performing 
marketing campaigns, thereby increasing sales.
	
• Nonquantifiable problem: If the sales manager states that the sales 
have declined by 5 percent to 10 percent for the past four years 
due to a lack of motivation among the sales reps, you should avoid 
trying to measure this decline. Avoid statistical measurements that 
require heavy data modeling, such as regression and T-models.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
	
✓	What are your goals, and what does success look like?
	
	These questions usually invoke a wealth of responses. You want to be 
sure to get each goal down to a simple statement and keep the count to 
the top three or four most important goals.
	
In addition, the goals need to include quantifiable responses that can be mea­
sured with a defined target. Each goal should tie directly to solving one or 
more of the problems identified in the responses to the first question, which 
is the only way you’ll be able to measure the return on investment of your Big 
Data visualization project.
Here are two examples that show you the difference between good and bad 
goals:
	
✓	CFO (Chief Financial Officer): “We want to increase our company’s rev­
enue by 10 percent in the next 12 months. This will require that we bring 
in an additional $500 million in revenue across all divisions.”
	
	We consider this to be a good goal because it has a clear target with a set 
timeframe that can be measured.
	
✓	Sales Manager: “We hope to influence when our product hits the sales 
shelves, to drastically improve our ability to sell more, and therefore to 
hit our target of a 10 percent revenue increase in the next 12 months. 
However, because we are distributors and have no actual control over 
the shelving process in the stores, our sales rep will be required to visit 
the store managers twice as much each month to build the relation­
ships, hopefully influencing our products hitting the shelf sooner.”
	
	This is considered to be a bad goal because the sales manager is seeking 
to increase his revenue by reducing the time it takes for products to hit 
the shelf — an action that he today has no influence over. This is a 
typical case of users wanting to view data that is not intelligent 
(unactionable).
	
When you’re able to document one to four solid goals, your aim is to gain 
consensus for each goal among the entire group to prevent confusion going 
forward.
Table 7-2 shows the answers that members of a sales team provided when 
they were asked to complete the BIDF Planning Guide.
As you can see, some of the problems listed in Table 7-2 refer to cultural issues 
and broken processes, which is common for most customers. This confirms 
the need for a data visualization that provides a single version of the truth.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
The good news is that these goals are very quantitative. After you confirm the 
expected target, bonus, and increase in profitability for each person, you can 
create the storyboard easily. We discuss this topic more in the next chapter.
Documenting KPIs
After you’ve documented the high-level goals, you need to capture and docu­
ment your audience’s KPIs. In simple terms, a KPI is a core measurement that 
ties directly to the company’s goals. In the sales-team example, the sales 
manager might identify revenue as a KPI, as it’s critical that this number is 
tracked on a regular basis to ensure it will hit the company target.
Conducting scoping workshops
The best way to work with your audience to document their KPIs is to con­
duct a series of scoping workshops. These workshops can be done virtually 
or (preferably) in person, like the planning sessions.
For the purposes of this book, we use the BIDF definition of scoping: an event 
where a group of identified super users from each LOB gather (physically or 
remotely) to openly discuss and define their business requirements.
Although conducting these workshops may seem to be innocent, if not han­
dled properly, they can quickly turn into a never-ending list of requirements 
that will never fit into a single data visualization.
After all of the KPIs are identified and documented, it’s important to ask the 
following question about each one: Does this KPI help the user achieve one 
or more of the goals listed in the Planning Guide?

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
If the answer is yes, proceed to collect and document the next KPI. If the 
answer is no or undecided, question the relevance of the KPI to this data 
visualization project and try to discourage group members from putting any 
useless information in the data visualization.
	
A data visualization should tell a clear story. Like any story in the multimedia 
world, it should have a clear narrative that includes a plot (in this case, 
achieving goals).
We recommend using the BIDF BI Blueprint (which you can download online 
for free at www.dummies.com/extras/datavisualization), shown in 
Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3: BIDF BI Blueprint.
	
Understanding the key measurements that must be viewed, monitored, or 
tracked by your audience members is a vital but tricky process. Most users 
want to see more data than they actually need to address their problems.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
The KPIs listed in Table 7-3 are well defined and include concise definitions 
that resonate with all the business users.
By now, you should have a clear idea of what your audience members need 
to see to accomplish their goals. Pat yourself on the back. At this stage, 40 
percent of the heavy lifting is done. But before you can proceed to create a 
mock-up (the first-draft preview of your data viz), you need to choose what 
kind of data visualization to build.
Building Your First Storyboard
Although the concept of storyboarding isn’t new, the approaches and tools 
available to create storyboards continue to evolve. Mico recalls building her 
first storyboards with pencil and paper or on whiteboards with dry-erase 
markers. Over time, she scanned and moved those sketches to Microsoft 
PowerPoint. Fortunately, a plethora of tools specifically geared to this task 
is available now.
This book uses the BIDF storyboard section for section outline shown in 
Figure 7-1, earlier in this chapter, to make the process easy to follow.
Section 1: Current State
Section 1: Current State of the storyboard describes the user’s current state. 
It should answer two simple questions: What is the current status of the main 
goal(s)? What is the likelihood of hitting or missing the main goal(s)?
In the continuing sales example, the sales managers identified their overall 
goal as hitting their bonuses. Therefore, you determine that Section 1 should 
display the information shown in Figure 7-4.

State.

Time is relative to the actual KPI. “Where you are now?” could mean today, 
yesterday, last quarter, or last year. It really is based on how it makes sense 
to measure that goal.
In the sales storyboard example, you’re tracking whether the sales team will 
hit its bonuses. So your main KPIs would be
	
✓	Probability to hit sales bonus: Likelihood of the sales reps actually 
getting their bonuses
	
✓	Trending status of sales: Comparison of behavior of sales over a 
specified period
	
✓	Actual sales: Current sales amount
Although the data is being updated and viewed on a daily basis, it’s being 
tracked on a monthly and yearly basis to keep track of the long-term goal. 
Bonuses are paid at year-end, but viewing them on a monthly basis breaks 
the tasks into smaller, achievable milestones, which makes it more digestible 
for the user.
	
When developing the KPIs for this section and all other sections, it’s impor­
tant to focus on the behavior of your typical user, who is likely to have less 
than a minute to scan his or her status before a big meeting. This section 
should let the user see at a glance whether things are going well or badly.
Section 2: Trends
Section 2: Trends of the storyboard describes how the user got to the current 
state. For example, if the current state shows that the main goal is off target, 
then the trends area should display a set of measurements that show exactly 
what factors contributed to missing the target. Conversely, if the current 
state shows that the main goal is on or above target, then the trends area 
should display a set of measurements that shows the factors that contributed 
to this success.
The description of the measurements that will be shown in the sales story­
board is shown in Figure 7-5. Assume that the probability of the manager 
hitting his goal is low. Your next step is to work with the users to determine 
the top reasons why sales managers may or may not hit their goals and the 
effect of those measurements on the overall goal.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
Figure 7-5: Sales Storyboard Example Section 2: Trends.
Following are some of the top reasons that the main sales goal may be miss­
ing its target, which you might derive after talking with the users and study­
ing some of the data from their existing reports:
	
✓	Marketing-campaign performance: Money spent on a given marketing 
campaign versus the ROI (return on investment) received is low.
	
✓	Unshipped items: Items expected to be shipped on a given date are not 
shipped, leading to a loss in sales.
	
✓	Customer missed sales targets: Projected sales targets for given retail 
customer(s) has not been met.
	
✓	Speed to shelf: The time it takes a retailer to place items on the shelf 
(can’t be influenced by a sales manager) is delayed, resulting in a loss in 
sales.
There are always going to be a host of reasons why a goal is not being met. 
The idea is to focus on the 20 percent of the reasons that are resulting in 80 
percent of the failure.
	
Focus on metrics that are within the user’s control, as data visualizations 
need to contain actionable data. Displaying information that isn’t actionable 
is a waste of the user’s time and leads to low user adoption. In the example, 
the speed-to-shelf measure, for instance, is one that should be questioned.
	
Don’t display data just for the sake of displaying it — a common mistake 
among data visualization newbies.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
	
To ensure that the user understands why you’re displaying these particular 
measures, show the cumulative and individual impact of each measure on the 
overall sales goal.
	
This is why you don’t want to have low-impact or nonactionable measure­
ments. If users can’t immediately gauge the importance of the measurements 
as a part of the story, you lose their attention. Worse, users may proceed to 
do their own analysis, which defeats the purpose of providing useful informa­
tion in your data visualization.
Section 3: Forecast
Section 3: Forecast of the storyboard should provide a clear projection of 
where the main sales goal will end up if no action is taken. It should also pro­
vide a clear view of where the main goal will end up compared with the origi­
nal target and highlight any gaps.
For the sales storyboard example, you can use the metrics from Section 2: 
Trends of the storyboard, this time highlighting future behavior and effect on 
the existing goal:
	
✓	Sales forecast: Projections of sales figures for the next 12 months based 
on existing trends
	
✓	Marketing-campaign performance: Projection of performance for rest of 
month based on existing trend
Figure 7-6 shows what Section 3: Forecast of the storyboard might look like.

 Chapter 7: Defining an Easy-to-Follow Storyboard
	
Just like all elements of your storyboard, the forecast referred to in this book 
has to be actionable. It should either encourage the actions described in 
Section 4: What-if of the storyboard (the what-if section) or discourage the 
actions of the user that have led to the current outcome.
Section 1: Current State of the storyboard (refer to Figure 7-4) displays sales 
versus target, sometimes confused with the forecast. Therefore, including the 
same information in Section 3: Forecast would be repetitive. To continue the 
story, simply display a projection of the metrics from Section 2: Trends of 
the storyboard.
	
After the correct list of measurements has been established, it’s sometimes 
easier to display the forecast as a function of the current state or trends sec­
tion. Not only is real estate of most data visualizations very limited, but 
including the forecast as a simple line on a chart or number display next to 
the KPI helps to effectively get the point across in most cases.
Section 4: What-if
The way we approach this section in the BIDF world is very different from tra­
ditional BI practice, and it truly delivers value when you’re developing a Big 
Data visualization.
	
What-if is defined in most data visualizations today as a scenario, often dis­
played as a series of sliders or dials, that enables the user to choose specific 
criteria and watch how they affect the goals. By modifying certain measures, 
the user can see how those changes will directly affect a specific KPI.
We assume that you’re reading this book because you truly want to provide 
insight into your organization’s Big Data. You want to avoid just placing 
charts on a sheet and calling the sheet a data visualization. We also assume 
that you’re actually trying to develop something that folks might view as 
being highly intelligent.
	
Now that we’re on the same page, let us repeat that truly valuable Big Data 
visualizations focus on providing intelligent actionable data to users. 
Providing a set of sliders on the data viz that let users go on a wild goose 
hunt for the ultimate scenario is a waste of their time. When that happens, 
users will abandon the data viz for something that provides the answer so 
that they don’t have to find the ideal scenario through trial and error.
The what-if section of your BIDF storyboard provides the missing piece of 
the story: a clear set of recommendations that, if followed, will help the users 
improve their current state. You provide the most optimal combinations of 
actions the users can take to have the greatest effect on achieving their goals.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Suppose that the sales manager isn’t meeting her goal. From the trends, we 
already know what happened. In Section 4 we want to display some sugges­
tions for improving the current situation. The suggestion may look like this:
	
✓	Bad marketing-campaign performance: Money spent on a given market­
ing campaign(s) didn’t provide the expected return in sales.
	
	Based on the available historic and existing data, an example recommen­
dation may be to move money from the existing campaign to a campaign 
that has been performing consistently for the last 5 years, though with 
much lower returns.
	
✓	Missed shipped items (dollars): Items expected to ship on a given date 
either shipped late or not at all.
	
	Based on the available historic and existing data, an example recommen­
dation may be to immediately source the product from a warehouse that 
is stocked and has historically shipped on time to avoid the loss in sales.
	
✓	Top 3 unmet customer sales targets: Sales targets with given retail 
customer(s) were lower than projected.
	
	Based on the available historic and existing data, an example recommen­
dation may be to focus on a set of smaller customers who have a history 
of great sales to make up for the missed sales targets with the other 
customers.
One easy way to make these recommendations digestible to the user is to pro­
vide three buckets of options with different risk levels, as shown in Table 7-4.
Table 7-4	
What-if Examples
What-if Buckets
Recommendations
Option A
Risk Level – High
Impact – 98%+
Reallocate 100% of Campaign A funding to Campaign B, 
which has been performing in a similar region.
Launch a new campaign in the East Coast region based on 
previous-year sales at a specific store.
Option B
Risk Level – 
Medium
Impact – 87%+
Reduce funding of Campaign A to less than 70%.
Add a discount to existing promotion to make it more 
attractive.
Focus on three smaller customers who have a solid sales 
history to make up the two missed customer sales targets.
Option C
Risk Level – Low
Impact – 60%+
Reduce funding of Campaign A to less than 30%.
Add an online coupon option to existing promotion.
Re-allocate the order to Warehouse A, which is fully 
stocked and historically ships on time.

This example gives users several options with varying levels of risks and 
effect to contemplate. The system has already done the analysis that would 
otherwise be done manually in an Excel spreadsheet and provides a clear 
path for users to achieve their goal and ultimately achieve success.
Give yourself a pat on the back! The process that you just went through 
is perhaps the most difficult part of building any data visualization. It’s 
essentially the blueprint by which you provide true intelligence.
The sales storyboard sums up the customer’s sales story by letting the sales 
manager know
	
✓	Whether he’s going to hit his goal
	
✓	How far he is from hitting or missing his goal
	
✓	What actions led to missing or hitting his goal (show the exact effect 
those trends had on the goal)
	
✓	Where he will end up if he continues down the same course (show the 
exact effect those trends will have on his goal)
	
✓	What actions he can take to hit or exceed his goal (show a list of actions, 
their risk factors, and how they will affect the goal)
Be excited. At this stage, your user is going to think you’re a data visualiza­
tion god!

Developing a Clear Mock-Up
In This Chapter
▶	Going from storyboard to mock-up
▶	Knowing when to use color
▶	Using a template
▶	Developing your first mock-up
A

fter you’ve done the hard work of defining and outlining your story­
board, it’s time to develop your mock-up. Mock-ups are also referred to 
as wireframes or prototypes. Think of them as rough sketches that help you 
visualize what the final output will look like.
Much like developing your storyboard, developing a clear, effective mock-up 
requires working very closely with your users. This is where many 
newbies get into trouble. If the process isn’t handled correctly, 
it can quickly turn into a never-ending cycle of layout and 
color changes.
You’ll quickly discover that the Big Data visualiza­
tion world is full of what we call “color-crazy users.” 
They can become your worst nightmare unless you 
follow the proven, untraditional approach we use 
in the Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula 
(BIDF) described in this book.
In this chapter, you discover how to start with a 
simple black-and-white sketch to focus your users 
on confirming your mock-up layout. In Chapter 9, you 
see how to apply effective visuals that convey your 
storyboard message. In Chapter 10, you discover how 
to add functionality and color to finalize your mock-up.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Getting Started with Your Mock-Up
Mico learned the hard way that working with users to develop anything 
visual is like handing candy to a baby. Without some guidance and hand-
holding, users can’t help but overindulge in color and chart changes. They 
lose focus and miss the opportunity to effectively display the story their data 
is trying to tell.
Mock-ups are particularly important in the Big Data visualization process for 
two reasons:
	
✓	They help accelerate the overall design discussion and process with 
the users. It’s much easier to change a sketch of the data than it is to 
change the final model.
	
✓	They help users understand the look, feel, and functionality of the 
final data visualization. Mock-ups help to prevent any cosmetic sur­
prises for the users when they see the final data visualization.
	
In the Big Data visualization world, visuals are made for data — not data for 
visualizations. This means that any design choice made based on the idea 
that it will be “sexy” often leads to a non-user-friendly visualization that 
doesn’t convey the message of the storyboard effectively.
Sticking to black and white
You may find the title of this section a bit unexpected. After all, isn’t one of 
the main points of data visualization to use elements like color to tell the 
most effective stories from the data? The answer is yes, but not during the 
mock-up stage.
	
If you start the mock-up process with color, your users won’t focus on 
anything else — not on the data, on the layout, or even on whether the 
message is being conveyed correctly. The color discussion will become the 
focal point of the entire mock-up process, and your final data visualization 
will suffer.
Mico clearly remembers her first experience working with five color-crazy 
users at a Fortune 50 company. The discussion about the final shade of the 
colors for the alerts lasted days beyond the allotted project time. The result­
ing data visualization, which was late, was not worth showing.
	
Don’t be perturbed if you have a similar experience. Sticking to black and 
white in initial mock-ups is the key to avoiding repeats of that experience. By 
using mock-ups without color, you force users to focus on what you need 
them to focus on.

 Chapter 8: Developing a Clear Mock-Up
Your only goal at this stage is to get participants to sign off on the layout 
of your mock-up. You don’t need to do anything fancy or artsy to get that 
approval.
Although this approach seems to be fairly logical, we realize that some of 
you may be nervous about taking it. You may fear that users may grow impa­
tient with or be turned off by a plain black-and-white mock-up. To overcome 
this worry, you should make it a habit to reiterate and set expectations 
up front about what users should expect to happen next and in the final 
outcome.
	
We always tell the users that color will be added as the last step, but we need 
them to focus on the layout before they can get to the fun stuff. This discus­
sion is fairly easy to have, and most users won’t object.
	
The exception to this rule is mock-ups created for an executive audience. 
Your time with executives is likely to be limited, so it’s critical that you don’t 
approach them until you have a fully functional, well-branded visualization 
(see Chapter 10). Anything less, and you risk being axed!
Some other benefits of sticking to black and white for your initial mock-up 
include the following:
	
✓	Saves time and money when making changes: It’s less expensive 
to make design modifications on a black-and-white sketch than it is 
to make changes on a system-ready visualization connected to live 
data.
	
✓	Keeps the focus on the placement, position, and size of each element 
on the visualization: Laying things out in a flat, colorless space helps 
you figure out where to place each component to provide a nice, clear 
user interface that tells a compelling story. Color sometimes distorts 
your view of the overall layout and causes you to focus on the shiniest 
items in the model.
Now that you know why it’s so important to stick to black and white for your 
mock-ups, we’ll discuss the most effective tools to use.
Using good ol’ pencil and paper
Although software is available for doing just about everything, includ­
ing drawing your mock-ups, don’t overlook the good old pencil-and-paper 
approach. It’s as good now as it was in 1801, when the first pie chart 
appeared in William Playfair’s publication The Statistical Breviary.
Figure 8-1 shows the most basic tools you can use to create a mock-up: 
papers and a pencil and an eraser.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Figure 8-1: Pencil and paper worked in the 1800’s, and they still work today.
To get started, you should have some blank white paper (or a sketch pad of 
some sort), two pencils, and a big eraser. You’ll be doing a lot of erasing.
As software continues to evolve, however, there are fewer arguments for 
using pencil and paper. Here are a few pros for the old-fashioned method:
	
✓	Low cost: A few sheets of white paper, a pack of pencils, and a big eraser 
will set you back $10 at most, although it’s likely that you already have 
most of these items in your possession.
	
✓	No learning curve: You can just pick up a pencil and start drawing. You 
don’t need to learn how to use a toolbar or menu options in software.
	
✓	More creative freedom for newbies: It would be great if we were all 
blessed with graphic design skills. We’re sure that you’d love to know 
how to use advanced graphics tools like Adobe Photoshop to whip 
up any visualization you desire. But most of us have no formal design 
training and need to stick to the basics. Pencil and paper provide the 
freedom to be as creative as you want without being hampered by a key­
board, mouse, or annoying pop-ups on the screen.
Here are a few arguments against using pencil and paper:
	
✓	Sharing can be difficult. You won’t have convenient options for sharing 
your mock-up to collaborate with your users or get their feedback.
	
✓	Paper pages are often too small to share with a large audience. Even 
big sheets of paper may be hard for everyone to see at once.

 Chapter 8: Developing a Clear Mock-Up
	
✓	Paper lacks security. To ensure the highest level of security, most 
organizations encourage their employees to embrace a digital lifestyle. 
Doing nightly backups on employees’ PCs enables the company to 
minimize the impact of a disaster. Having a paper trail with no backup 
is asking for an accident. Based on some embarrassing experiences, 
we’ve exchanged some of our pencil-and-paper habits for more
web-based ones.
Using web-based or desktop tools
Although this market is still maturing, using a software-based tool to do your 
mock-up can be quite beneficial for several reasons:
	
✓	It’s easy to get feedback. Collecting feedback on your mock-up is easy 
when you use online or web-based tools. Most applications provide 
multiple options that allow you to export mock-ups in the form of PDF or 
image files. You can send these files to your users electronically to get 
their feedback.
	
✓	Inviting collaborators is simple on the web. Knowledge sharing and 
collaboration are vital parts of the mock-up process. By hosting mock-
ups on the web, you can invite co-workers and other team members to 
provide their input or feedback.
	
	Be very careful about giving other people permission to modify your 
mock-ups directly. Not knowing who did what can lead to chaos.
	
✓	You save time when making modifications. The beauty of using soft­
ware is that you can easily save old and new versions of your model for 
comparison purposes. Then it’s easy to incorporate users’ feedback and 
present updated mock-ups.
	
✓	You can build a reusable library. One much-overlooked benefit is the 
ability to create a library of template mock-ups that you can save and 
then reuse for future products. Templates save time, and it’s much 
easier to start with a previous mock-up than it is to start with a blank 
canvas.
	
✓	Most software tools are free or inexpensive. Most tools on the market 
today are free to individual users for a specified number of mock-ups. If 
you want to invite more collaborators or have multiple projects running 
at the same time, the most sophisticated web tools cost anywhere from 
$5 to $100 per month for use by an entire team.
	
As the market for software that allows users to design prototypes rapidly 
continues to evolve, do an Internet search for online mock-up tools to get an 
updated list of software choices.

Discovering some software tools
Here are two of our top software choices.
Balsamiq Mockups
One of the best-known, most popular mock-up tools is Balsamiq Mockups (http://balsamiq.
com), a cloud-based service (with an accompanying desktop application) that enables you to create 
fun and interactive website mock-ups quickly and easily. With its trademark sketchy, hand-drawn look, 
as shown in Figure 8-2, Balsamiq Mockups is currently our number-one choice for black-and-white 
mock-ups, and we like the fact that adding color or images is simple.
The application comes with a huge collection of drop-in components, reusable libraries, and an 
easy drag-and-drop interface. Because it’s cross-platform and has full offline support, you can 
create mockups anywhere. At this writing, the desktop application starts at around $79 (one-time 
fee) for a single-user license. Plans start at $12 per month.
Mockup Tiger
Mockup Tiger (www.mockuptiger.com) is a web-based/desktop application that enables you 
to create dashboard mock-ups as shown in Figure 8-3 and share them with clients or co-workers.
Mockup Tiger comes with even more components than Balsamiq Mockups that can be used spe­
cifically for dashboarding. It includes an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.
When you’re ready to share your mock-up, you can export projects as PDF or image files, or you can 
share them directly with others who have access to Mockup Tiger. People with access can leave 
feedback and comments on the project.

Building Template Layouts
Whether you’ve chosen to use pencil and paper or a software mock-up tool, the 
good news is that you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Building and using tem­
plates is the quickest and smartest way to approach designing your mock-ups.
The elements shown in Figure 8-2 make up your first mock-up template. Each 
element corresponds to one of the following steps:

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
	
1.	Start with a frame.
	
	 Start by drawing a simple, square frame. Think of this frame as being the 
home of all your data visualization elements.
	
2.	Determine where to place the logo.
	
	 Company branding is a top priority for most organizations. We recom­
mend placing your logo in the top-right or top-left corner of your frame. 
Although some people argue that placement in the bottom-left corner of 
the frame works well, we prefer to place elements such as logos at the top.
	
3.	Add a title.
	
	 The title of your mock-up is very important and should be housed in 
the top-right corner or center of your frame. The title is the first thing 
that most users will see, and you want to make it very clear what they’re 
viewing.
	
4.	Provide a help menu section.
	
	 You may want to include a set of help buttons in your data visualization. 
Some of the most popular options include
	
• Print button: Allows users to print the data viz from their devices as 
needed
	
• Reset button: Allows users to start from the beginning
	
• Help button: Provides helpful information about the data viz
	
• FAQ button: Provides information about various aspects of the 
data viz
	
5.	Add a navigation area.
	
	 The easiest way to tackle this section is to think about your three 
favorite websites. The navigation elements of those sites are probably 
along the top, on the left side, or in both places. Because users read in 
a backward Z pattern, these areas are the most effective places for any 
navigational menus.
	
6.	Add a copyright line.
	
	 This line usually goes at the bottom of the data visualization to ensure 
that users see that the work is copyrighted.
Now that you’ve included the main elements, it’s time to decide on a layout 
to display your data elements, as shown in Figure 8-3.

Adding Effective Visuals to 
Your Mock-Up
In This Chapter
▶	Examining common traits of effective visuals
▶	Creating insight and not hindsight
▶	Transitioning from storyboard to visual mock-up
W

hen your black-and-white mock-up is complete, you’re ready to add 
the oh-so-powerful visuals that will make it pop. That’s why you 
started this journey to begin with, right? When adding visuals to your mock-
up, it’s important to focus on adding effective visuals. Unfortunately, due to 
a lack of thought leadership and training in the business intelligence 
(BI) industry, tons of visually attractive but ineffective data 
visualizations provide zero value. Just do an Internet search 
for data visualizations to see a few examples.
This chapter takes a closer look at what constitutes 
effective visuals. By way of comparison, it also looks 
at the qualities of some ineffective visuals.
	
Visuals are much more than just charts. As you can 
see from the topics covered in this book, great data 
visualizations are a combination of charts, objects, 
and text placed strategically to tell a story of 
the data.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Recognize the Three Traits of 
an Effective Visual
Table 9-1 lists the three main traits of an effective visual.
Table 9-1	
Three Traits of an Effective Visual
Trait
Details
Data is clear
Make sure that the data is clear, both in purpose and 
display.
Visual fits the data
Whether you choose a chart or text, be sure that 
you’re using the right visual for the job.
Exceptions are easy to 
spot
Whether you’re highlighting a comparison or outliers 
in the data, you should make it easy for your users to 
identify exceptions in the data.
	
The preceding table was influenced by Edward Tufte, who is considered to 
be the godfather of data visualization. His book The Visual Display of 
Quantitative Information, 2nd Edition (Graphics Press), is one of the most 
highly regarded books in the data visualization field. Though it takes a 
scientific approach, it’s a must-read for data viz beginners and experts alike.
The following sections provide more detail on the traits listed in Table 9-1.
	
These three traits aren’t all-inclusive, so you shouldn’t expect to have all of 
them to decide whether a visual should make it into your mock-up. Instead, 
use them as guidelines as you choose your visuals. The more traits you have 
in each visual, the more effective your overall data viz will be!
Data is clear
Effective visuals display data that’s clear in both presentation and purpose, 
not distorted in any way. A common mistake is to push too much data into a 
single visual, causing the important point of the data to be hidden, overshad­
owed, or distorted by all the noise. Figure 9-1 shows a good example of a data

popular mobile devices.
It’s also important to ensure that the purpose of the visual is super-clear so 
that the user has no room for misinterpretation. As we mention in Chapter 5, 
good data visualizations tell a story at a glance, leaving the reader wanting 
more. If the data visualization is confusing or misinterpreted, most users get 
turned off and abandon it. Figure 9-2 (which you can find at the same URL as 
Figure 9-1) shows an example of a confusing visualization that depicts the 
usage of social networks. Unfortunately the colors and percentages seem to 
have no correlation and are therefore very confusing. Can you tell what the 
visualization is portraying?

top social networks.

Visual fits the data
The visual has to fit the data. (See Chapter 4 for information about choos­
ing effective charts.) Visuals are more than just charts, however, and certain 
visuals just don’t fit certain data. Usually, you can present data in multiple 
ways. Your job is to find the most effective way to do so.
	
You should never use a pie chart, for example, to show data with more than 
five data points or to display any data set with little to no variation in 
magnitude. Similarly, you should never use a table or scorecard to show a 
trend over time. Chapter 14 covers the challenge of choosing the right visual 
and other pitfalls of data visualizations.
Figure 9-3 shows two visualizations that chart the same data. The line chart 
at the top is the best option for showing the Sales Margin trend in 2014, 
because it makes it blatantly clear that the company’s expenses are soaring 
way above its profits. The column chart at the bottom doesn’t convey that 
trend as clearly. Column charts are best used to compare items.
Line chart

trend.

comparison,
not a trend.
Figure 9-3: The line chart is the better representation of this data.
Exceptions are easy to spot
Whether they’re in the form of alerts, comparisons, or outliers, exceptions in 
the data should be easy to spot in an effective visual. If an exception requires 
additional deep analysis to understand, chances are that your visual isn’t 
effective.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
Exceptions in data visualizations are extremely powerful and can add great 
value. When users can spot exceptions and decipher them quickly, they 
know whether immediate, moderate, or light attention is needed. Highlighting 
exceptions also provides insight into potential trends that may require 
attention. We discuss this topic in the next section.
Figure 9-4 shows a chart that uses an alert to highlight some of the excep­
tions in the sales data trend. This image is at www.metricinsights.com/
product/kpi-warehouse/.
Figure 9-4: This daily sales line chart points out the exceptions using 
alert colors and a visual cue.
Focus on Insight, Not Hindsight
Sadly, many organizations today look in the rearview mirror when it comes 
to making critical business decisions. Whether the problems are due to a lack 
of data availability or the use of the wrong measurements, problems often 
become visible in the data viz only after they occur. As a result, the user can 
only react to what has already happened, acting on hindsight.
When you include what we call intelligent data to make your data visualiza­
tion useful, you try to provide as much insight as possible by using the data 
to hint at what the future may hold. Using past trends to forecast future 
behavior is one way to do this. You want to give the user insight so that he or 
she can be proactive in making decisions that may prevent problems.
	
The combination of Big Data with a good data visualization can tell you not 
only where you’ve been (hindsight) but also where you’re going and even 
how to get there (insight). Therefore, your data visualization should provide 
a preview of what may be coming next.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Add Visuals to Your Mock-Up
Drum roll! This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. It’s time to add visuals 
to your storyboard. For the sake of consistency, the examples in this chapter 
build on the storyboard example from Chapter 7.
This section shows you how to transform your BI storyboard into an effective 
mock-up. You pull together all the pieces of your storyboard to develop an 
effective data visualization that your users will adopt and find great value in.
	
Your BI storyboard has four sections:
	
✓	Current State: Where are you now?
	
✓	Trends: How did you get here?
	
✓	Forecast: Where will you end up?
	
✓	What-if: What can you change to achieve or exceed your goals?
At this stage, you should have the main layout of your mock-up completed, 
with all the required elements (logo, title, and so on) that we discuss in 
Chapter 8. All the visuals that we discuss in this chapter will be placed into 
the layout section of the mock up, as shown in Figure 9-5.
	
Effective visuals aren’t limited to charts, so at times, you may use text or 
colors in the header and navigation sections to make your message more 
effective. See Chapter 5 for more details on how to use visual cues to 
humanize your message and make it more effective.
Figure 9-5: The layout section is where 95 percent of the 
visuals will be housed.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
	
Before you get into the following sections that describe how to put together 
our example mock-up, it’s important that you understand that the user of the 
data in the example is Steve Johnson, the senior director of sales for a major 
toy company, whose main interest is, of course, sales numbers. His division is 
responsible for more than $2 billion dollars in transactions annually. He’s 
been giving a mandate to grow his business by 5 percent ($100MIL) in the 
next three years, and he wants to track that goal both on macro (annual) and 
micro (weekly) levels.
Section 1: Current State
Based on our discussions with our senior sales director and his team, we 
used our BIDF Blueprint to really understand and document his requirements 
(see Chapter 8). As a result, in Section 1: Current State, we display two sales-
related KPIs to give the user a good view of what is currently happening with 
respect to the annual and weekly goals. Those two KPIs are
	
✓	Probability to Hit Sales Target: Measures the likelihood that the sales 
reps will hit their sales targets to get their bonuses
	
✓	Sales: Measure the actual sales amount on a weekly and year-to-date 
(YTD) basis
	
See Chapter 7 for more information about the Section 1: Current State portion 
of the storyboard.
Using these two measurements, we then do a further evaluation of each to 
find the most effective way to visualize them on the mock-up, as the following 
sections illustrate.
Showing the Probability to Hit Sales Target KPI
First, examine Figure 9-6, and note details on this measurement from the 
Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula (BIDF) Blueprint:
	
✓	Format: Percentage
	
✓	Alerts: Green if more than 90 percent, yellow if 85 percent to 89 percent, 
red if less than 84 percent
	
✓	Viewing Period: Daily
	
✓	Reporting Period: Daily

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Figure 9-6: The BIDF Blueprint with the details of the two metrics for 
Section 1: Current State.
To further decide how we could most effectively visualize the probability 
to hit sales target KPI, we closely studied the attributes of it in the BIDF 
Blueprint, as shown in Figure 9-6, and made a few key observations:
	
✓	Priority: The Probability to Hit Sales Target KPI should be front and 
center in the data viz, and easy to read at a glance.
	
✓	Visibility: The Probability to Hit Sales Target KPI needs to be large 
enough in size to stand out from the other visuals.
	
✓	Visual: The appropriate visuals for the Probability to Hit Sales Target KPI 
are a donut chart to show visual progress and alerts with text to show 
the actual probability percentage.
	
✓	Color: The KPI (RAG) red, amber, and green colors must stand out.
	
✓	Interactivity: The Probability to Hit Sales Target KPI will be updated 
daily, but it has no drill down so it will not be interactive.
	
The preceding observations are the exact thought process that our teams go 
through as we translate the BIDF Blueprint into effective visuals for our mock-
up. Please be sure to read through the observations carefully to ensure you 
understand our logic before moving on. Many data viz fail during the transla­
tion process, so this is an area you’ll want to spend some time on. The good 
news is that with experience it becomes much easier to translate your BIDF 
Blueprint into a mock-up.
After studying the requirements that we gathered and documented from the 
users in the BIDF Blueprint, we developed the visualization shown in Figure 9-7 
using a wireframe tool called Balsamiq. (See Chapter 8 for more details on great 
wireframing tools.)

chart and text.
Figure 9-7: Displaying the probability of hitting a target by 
using two large circles and some text.
In Figure 9-7, notice that the big circles in this visualization were made to 
stand out from the rectangles. This detail draws attention to the current state 
and the probability that the goal will be reached.
Showing the Sales KPI
If you look back at the BIDF Blueprint in Figure 9-6, you see that the second 
KPI is Sales. In the chart view column for this KPI, it says that one of the 
requested views is actual sales over a 12-month period. To determine the 
most effective way to display this visual, we need to take a closer look at the 
other attributes of the Sales KPI:
	
✓	Format: Dollar ($0,000)
	
✓	Reporting Period: Daily
	
✓	Viewing Period: Weekly/YTD
	
✓	Alerts: None
To further decide how we could most effectively visualize the Sales KPI, we 
closely studied the attributes of it in the BIDF Blueprint, as shown in Figure 9-6, 
and made a few key observations:
	
✓	Priority: The users want to see their actual sales amount to help them 
gain a sense of their true current state and to relate it to the Probability 
to Hit Sales Target KPI.
	
✓	Visibility: The actual sales should be placed next to the Probability to 
Hit Sales Target KPI.
	
✓	Visual: The Sales KPI needs some context as discussed in Chapter 5; we 
can display the actual sales number and a simple horizontal thermom­
eter to let the user quickly identify the progress against the actual sales 
target for the given time period.

✓	Color: Red and green colors show if the actual sales are trending up or 
down.
	
✓	Interactivity: The Sales KPI will be updated daily, but it has no drill 
down so it will not be interactive.
	
When you develop your mock-up, before you place any visuals onscreen, you 
need to study the BIDF Blueprint and then work to make sense of why and how 
users would want to see certain data (sales, in this example) represented.
Figure 9-8 shows how the actual sales will be represented on the storyboard.
Text and color help the user
understand the current state
Figure 9-8: Add the Sales KPI to the mock-up.
	
Sometimes it helps to also include a visual. See Figure 9-9 in which we’ve 
added a horizontal thermometer to show the actual sales amount versus the 
target sales amount for the given period. For purposes of this book, we’re 
sticking to the idea of KISS (Keep It Simple, Superstar). Don’t be afraid to ven­
ture into the visual wilderness and use your creative nature, however.
The thermometers help the user
quickly see the status.
Figure 9-9: The Sales KPI is also displayed using a horizontal 
thermometer to compare the actual against the target.
Section 2: Trends
Section 2: Trends of the storyboard focuses on trends. This section should 
display how sales got to their current state, whether that state is good or 
bad. This section explains the history of the KPIs from Section 1: Current 
State.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
	
In the Trends sections, your visuals should highlight both good and bad sto­
ries of Section 1: Current State. For the example of the Sales storyboard we’ve 
been using, if a user met or exceeded her sales target, this section displays 
what she did to get there. For instance, let’s say a particular marketing cam­
paign provided a larger than expected ROI (return on investment). That’s a 
factor that directly affects the sales revenue and could explain why the user’s 
probability to hit her sales target may be 110 percent. Trust us: Any sales 
person would like to know this kind of information.
Similarly, if things aren’t going as planned and the user isn’t on schedule to 
meet her sales target, this section shows what’s wrong. Section 2: Trends pro­
vides great insight to the users and should help to drive proactive behavior.
Techniques for showing trends
There’s more than one way to visually represent trends. As always, you should consider the space 
you have available and the data that you’re representing and choose the best possible visual for 
the job.
For example, you can show upward or downward trends using a simple arrow as shown in this 
figure. (You can find this image online at www.bu.edu/campaign/2012/08/09/alumni-
participation-bu-bucks-the-trends/.)
A column chart is also an effective way to show trends, as shown here. (See the original image 
at http://makanaka.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/global-trends-to-
2030-and-the-confusion-of-alternative-worlds/.)

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
Referring back to Section 1: Current State, it’s clear that although our user, 
Steve Johnson, is on track to meet his MTD (month to date) sales target, his 
YTD (year to date) is in big trouble, with only a 35 percent chance of meeting 
the goal. Consequently, we had further discussion and asked, “Can you help 
us understand what factors would contribute to you exceeding or missing 
your sales target?”
We then documented those factors in our BIDF Blueprint using the same format 
that we did for Section 1: Current State. We came up with five measures, but in 
keeping with our KISS approach, we are using only two for this example:
	
✓	Sales Trend: Compares the behavior/trend of the sales revenue over a 
specified period of time.
	
✓	Marketing Campaign Performance: Displays the performances of the 
top five and bottom five marketing campaigns and shows their direct 
effect on the main goal of hitting the sales target.
	
Many organizations get stuck displaying trends in their data visualizations 
that have no relation to the bigger picture (the current state). Then they 
wonder why users don’t bother with or trust the data. This lack of informa­
tion only scratches the surface and forces the user to perform tons of addi­
tional analysis to determine the effects of those trends on their goals. You 
want to avoid this situation. You want your users to get as much of the 
information they need directly from your visualization.
	
Focus on showing what we call the impact of each visual. For our sales story­
board example, we did this by displaying how the performance of each mar­
keting campaign affected the overall sales. Figure 9-10 shows a way to display 
impact for the Trends section.
Shows the possible 
ﬁnancial impact each 
product could have on 
the annual revenue
Figure 9-10: Notice how each marketing campaign affects 
the sales.
One good thing about trends is they always occur over some period of time, 
such as hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. Your goal is to show 
a pattern (if one exists) to explain how the user ended up at his existing

current state, as well as to point out any exceptions that may have had a 
major impact on the current state. You’re essentially looking for outliers or 
patterns in the data that tell a story. Figure 9-11 shows a dual access chart 
with some outliers circled in red.
Figure 9-11: The exceptions (highs and lows) are clearly highlighted 
in this area chart.
Showing 12-month sales trend
If you have another look at the BIDF Blueprint in Figure 9-6, in the Chart View 
column it specifies that the users want to see a 12-month trend for Sales. As a 
reminder, the attributes of the sales KPI on the BIDF Blueprint are
	
✓	Format: Dollar ($0,000)
	
✓	Reporting Period: Daily
	
✓	Viewing Period: Weekly
	
✓	Alerts: None
To determine how to effectively visualize the 12-month sales trend view, we 
studied all of the attributes of the Sales KPI in the BIDF Blueprint and made a 
few key observations:
	
✓	Priority: The users want to see a trend of their sales likely to identify 
any exceptions or to determine if their sales are trending downward.
	
✓	Visibility: The 12-month sales view will be shown on a separate chart.
	
✓	Visual: Line charts are the best representation of trends over time.
	
✓	Color: Unless the user’s sales are trending down, alerts will not be used.
	
✓	Interactivity: The 12-month trend should have pop-ups for each month 
to show actual values.

When you develop your mock-up, before you place any visuals onscreen, you 
need to study the BIDF Blueprint and then work to make sense of why and how 
users would want to see certain data (sales, in this example) represented.
Figure 9-12 shows a line chart we built using Balsamiq to display 12 months 
of sales.
Figure 9-12: The line chart illustrates the trend in sales over 
a 12-month period.
Showing Marketing Campaign Performance
The second measurement covered in Section 2: Trends is Marketing 
Campaign Performance. It measures the effectiveness and ROI of each mar­
keting campaign. For instance, if the company invests $200K to run an ad 
campaign at all the local Target Stores for the holidays and expects a $500K 
return ($300K gain) but only receives a $450K return, then they received $50K 
less than expected and their projections need to be adjusted.
Figure 9-13 shows the BIDF Blueprint we’ve been using after we added a line 
for Marketing Campaign Performance. You can see what we learned about 
this metric:
	
✓	Format: Dollar ($0,000)
	
✓	Reporting Period: Daily
	
✓	Viewing Period: Daily
	
✓	Alerts: None

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Figure 9-13: Attributes of the Marketing Campaign Performance measurement in the 
BIDF Blueprint.
To further decide how we could most effectively visualize the Marketing 
Campaign Performance KPI as a part of the Section 2: Trends view to ensure 
it fits into the story we want to tell, we again closely studied the attributes 
of it in the BIDF Blueprint as shown in Figure 9-13 and made a few key 
­observations:
	
✓	Priority: After the users are finished with viewing their current state, 
this is the second layer to explain how they got to the current state.
	
✓	Visibility: When marketing campaigns fail or succeed, they directly 
affect the sales revenue projections and actuals. Hence, Marketing 
Campaign Performance KPI should be placed either to the right (as 
users read in a backward Z pattern as we discussed in Chapter 6) or on 
the right of Section 1: Current State.
	
✓	Visual: Because marketing campaigns can make or break sales reps 
when it comes to hitting sales targets, campaigns that have exceeded 
expectations or that have been performing below expectations in the 
past 6 months need to be identified. Essentially, the visualization should 
show the campaigns that had the biggest effect on the current state of 
the sales measurement. For our example, we will use a combination of 
text, a trending icon, and a chart. In addition, marketing campaigns that 
worked last year may not work this year, so the visualization should 
highlight any major exceptions that occur from year to year.
	
✓	Color: Red and green colors will only be used for the trending icon (an 
arrow) to show if the actual sales are trending up or down.
	
✓	Interactivity: The Marketing Campaign Performance KPI will be updated 
daily, and it has a drill-down so users can see why those campaigns are 
failing and identify the top 5 or 10 failing campaigns to give a broader 
view and more details than we can hold on the data viz.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
Figure 9-14 shows a snippet of the Balsamiq mock-up version of the visual 
that we used to display the Marketing Campaign Performance KPI. Notice 
that we focus not only on the actual performance amounts but also on the 
variance (difference in actual versus Target). Magnitude of change is very 
important when it comes to trends.
Actual sales to date is stated as well as the variance
compared to the target and to last year.
Figure 9-14: A wireframe version of how the Marketing 
Campaign Performance KPI may look.
	
When we prepared the visualization shown in Figure 9-15, we avoided using 
only a line chart that would show the trend without providing any actual indi­
cation of the magnitude of the gap between actual and planned sales. In the 
data visualization industry, best practices call for using a line chart when 
showing trends. We’ve found that using a line chart doesn’t always show 
enough information, however. The line indicates overall behavior. What the 
user really needs to know is the change over a given period. In addition, 
drawing attention to the campaigns that overperformed or underperformed 
and their direct effect on hitting the annual sales goal makes it easy for users 
to see how they got to their current state, which is why we used the bar chart 
on the right of Figure 9-14.
Section 3: Forecast
Finally, it’s the moment of truth. The users are on a journey, and now they need 
to know where they’ll end up at a given time if they don’t change their current 
course. Section 3 of the BI storyboard shows the forecast (see Figure 9-15).

Whereas we make the forecast a separate section for purposes of this book, 
many of our BIDF students actually embed it in Section 1: Current State. We’re 
making it a separate section in this book to explain the forecast before we 
show you how you can eventually incorporate it into Section 1: Current State. 
It’s a matter of personal preference and available real estate whether you 
keep the forecast as a separate Section 3: Forecast or incorporate it into 
Section 1: Current State. We’ve seen forecasts executed well both ways. 
Referring to our BI storyboard model, notice that most of the metrics have 
already been identified or displayed in previous sections. One of the main 
metrics in Section 1: Current State, Status of Sales Target, is also shown in 
Section 3: Forecast. Because we’ve already defined the metrics in Section 1, 
we just need to add a visual in Section 3 that shows users where they’ll end 
up at their current pace and, most important, the final outcome with regard 
to the goal. The forecast projects the outcome based on the current state.
In many organizations, the forecast numbers are often confused with the 
plan numbers. The difference is that planned numbers are usually preset by 
someone, whereas the forecast numbers are projected based on the current 
behavior of the metric (such as sales).
Figure 9-16 shows how to display the forecast number as part of Section 1: 
Current State.
Adding the forecast to Section 1: Current State is not only a smart use of the lim­
ited real estate on your data viz but it also aligns well with the idea of providing 
the reader a way to see where she’s heading compared to where she is today.
	
We’ve found that when we add text next to the actual sales figures as we did 
with Section 1: Current State, and we blatantly tell customers that they’re not 
going to hit their goals, we are often requested to soften the tone. 
Corporations, especially big ones, are very sensitive to the language being 
used in any type of internal communication, even data visualizations.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
Therefore, we caution you to use phrases that may be more encouraging, 
such as these:
	
✓	“Heads up! It’s time to change course to meet your goals.” This type of 
statement is best used when the numbers are heading in an unfavorable 
direction.
	
✓	“Don’t worry — you can still hit your goals with a few minor tweaks to 
your master plan.” This kind of phrase is best used when the numbers 
are slightly off and there’s still time to fix them.
	
These phrases may sound weird for a corporate setting, but you’re talking to 
human beings, not robots. (We cover the practice of using text analysis in 
more detail in Chapter 5, and we cover the idea of humanizing your visualiza­
tions in Chapter 10.) For good examples of humanized data visualizations, 
visit an infographic-rich site like http://visual.ly.
	
Your goal is to use a visualization to make the user’s story personal, relevant, 
and actionable.
Section 4: What-If
Perhaps the most powerful section, What-If is really the brains of the entire 
data visualization. Compared with traditional definitions, in the BIDF world, 
the What-If section provides a series of actionable recommendations, each 
with a different degree of risk, that users can act on directly to change the 
course of their future state.
After you’ve shown the users why their sales have been performing as they 
have been, you need to show them opportunities to improve their current 
status. One way to think of the BIDF What-If section is as a bucket of intel­
ligent recommendations that have been generated based on the statuses, 
trends, and forecasts shown in Sections 1, 2, and 3.
The forecast has been added
to Section 1: Current State.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
	
Both data viz developers and stakeholders often avoid the What-If section 
because of the level of involvement it takes for the business users and ana­
lysts to gain the logic that the what-if scenarios are based on and the exten­
sive effort required to develop a database to display the scenarios on the 
data viz. For this reason, this section isn’t used in 95 percent of today’s data 
visualizations. We recommend that after you master the other three ­sections 
you work on this area.
	
Gathering the information for Section 4 usually requires coordinating with 
data analysts or thoroughly questioning stakeholders to find the root of the 
problems. Most data viz novices aren’t prepared to handle this type of discus­
sion up front, as it takes some practice to engage the stakeholders to complete 
the BIDF Blueprint (which should be done first). After you master that conver­
sation, it’s much easier to steer the What-If discussion with your stakeholders.
We encourage you to get familiar with and think about the What-If section 
and then build on it as you hone your data viz skills. We could fill a book 
trying to explain what to cover in Section 4, but we’re focusing here on a 
slightly easier approach that helps you populate it without diving too deep 
into research conversations with your users. Table 9-2 shows an example of 
how we could formulate the recommendations based on the information we 
gathered for our example sales storyboard.

 Chapter 9: Adding Effective Visuals to Your Mock-Up 
	
If you’re new to data viz, we highly recommend that you master Sections 1, 2, 
and 3 in your first couple of data visualizations before taking on the informa­
tion in Section 4. Although Section 4 is a game-changer, if you do it incor­
rectly and the recommendations turn out to be inaccurate or have a negative 
financial impact, the professional ramifications can be devastating. The rec­
ommendations in this section have to be driven and controlled by your busi­
ness users. Your only aim is to ensure that the data is visualized correctly 
and that the data (if that’s your responsibility) is modeled correctly to pro­
duce the most optimal recommendations.

Adding Functionality and 
Applying Color
In This Chapter
▶	Humanizing your data viz
▶	Choosing effective colors
▶	Understanding navigation
N

ow that you’ve completed the mockup of each section of your storyboard 
and added some visuals, it’s time to add some functionality and color to 
your data viz. Adding functionality to your mockup requires that you bring it 
into your tool of choice. See Chapter 3 for more details on choosing the correct 
business intelligence (BI) tool to build your data visualization.
This chapter shows you how to develop a mobile-first 
mentality, add easy-to-use navigation by choosing 
the correct menu types, and choose and apply an 
effective color scheme to your data viz.
Adding these formatting and style components 
is what we refer to as the human side of data viz. 
Humanizing your data viz is a critical component 
of any data visualization.
Recognizing the Human Components
As compelling mobile apps continue to evolve, user 
expectations are at an all-time high. Gone are the days when 
apps could survive based simply on their usefulness. In the app 
world, having an attractive and intuitive user interface (UI) is a do-or-die 
proposition. In the data-viz world, a nice UI has typically been considered 
to be something that is nice to have, but that school of thought is changing. 
No matter how great the data is, if your data-viz UI is not user friendly then 
no one will use it.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Humanizing your visualizations
Adding the human component to your data visualization is a must, though 
sadly, many people overlook this task.
Following are some easy ways to humanize any data viz:
	
✓	Use simple navigation. Imagine having a car with the lock/unlock door 
buttons hiding under the seat, or a car with the open/close window but­
tons located in the trunk. Is that a car that you would buy or want to 
use? Probably not. The same is true of a data viz with confusing menus. 
It not only frustrates users as they attempt to get to their data but also 
causes them to stop using it.
	
✓	Use colors effectively. When it comes to color, what is effective and inef­
fective is always subjective. There are always users who don’t like a par­
ticular color. It’s your job to ensure that your data visualization follows 
some best practices for effectively applying color regardless of the color 
scheme.
	
✓	Use intuitive images and visual cues. One of the most overlooked 
humanization techniques is to apply easy-to-understand visual cues and 
images that appeal to the human mind. The emergence of social media 
sites such as Instagram and Flickr — which have hundreds of millions 
of users who gather online to share their images — demonstrates that 
human beings like to see images.
Thinking mobile first
Another thing to consider in the humanization of your data viz is the goal of 
designing first for mobile users. Let’s face it — the use of desktop computers 
is dwindling. Laptop sizes are shrinking at alarming rates, and mobile phones 
and tablets are becoming the main choices among users.
With this trend in mind, it’s important that you build your data viz first and 
foremost to fit on mobile devices. If you don’t, you risk having very low user 
adoption.
Here are a few benefits of building mobile visualizations first:
	
✓	The desktop is included. If you focus on building your data visualization 
for a mobile environment, it will certainly be usable on a desktop. Being 
forced to use a 7-inch screen (the size of most tablets) to display Big Data 
limits what can and can’t be shown in your data viz.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
133
 Chapter 10: Adding Functionality and Applying Color 
	
	That is why using our Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula (BIDF) 
method and narrowing down the story to make it concise and useful 
(see Chapter 7) are so important.
	
	You don’t have enough real estate on mobile devices to show every­
thing, hence, you’ll be forced to focus on what’s needed in the 7-inch 
display most tablets. Because most desktop screens tend to be bigger 
than 14 inches, anything that you design for a tablet will likely fit on any 
desktop as well.
	
✓	It forces simplicity. Another benefit of having limited real estate for your 
data viz is simplicity. A 7-inch screen can only hold one or two visuals 
at any given time before scrolling is required. Scrolls or swipes should 
be limited to two to three to avoid the risk of losing the user. This limit 
equates to a maximum of six visuals per data viz.
	
✓	It encourages easy user access and collaboration. If you build a house, 
but it doesn’t show up on GPS, visitors will have a problem finding 
where you live. The same is true of data visualizations. If you don’t make 
your data visualizations accessible on the devices people use most, 
don’t expect to get much foot traffic. Working from home and traveling 
have become vital parts of most professional careers, so users shouldn’t 
have to sit down and open a heavy laptop to see their data.
	
✓	It enhances collaboration. Giving users a way to take a screen shot and 
post comments to a collective knowledge base on a topic before making 
a decision leads to better decisions in less time.
Adding functionality
It’s important to understand functionality in the data-viz world: a series of 
actions that you expect users to take, usually in a sequential manner, that 
helps them have the most optimal experience with a given data viz. To deter­
mine what functionality to choose, ask yourself two questions:
	
✓	Where do I want the users to go? In most cases, when users enter your 
data viz, you want their eyes to focus on Section 1, their current state. 
A glance at the current snapshot should let them decide whether they 
need to address the matter immediately or come back later, based on 
whether their current state is negative or positive. (Refer to Chapter 7 
for a description of the different sections of a storyboard.)
	
✓	When the users get where I want them to be in the data viz, what 
happens next? The answer to this question is critical, as it dictates what 
you expect to happen after the users look at the data viz. The users’ 
next steps need to be clear.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Table 10-1 shows several common actions that users may take after they 
enter a data viz.
Table 10-1	
List of Common User Next-Step Actions
Action
Outcome
Make a decision
After the user sees the resulting data, he or she decides the 
next steps, which is your desired outcome. 
Use a menu 
selector
When using menu selectors, the user can filter or drill down 
into the visualization or even change what’s being displayed.
Move to next 
section
The user understands the message that the data is commu­
nicating and needs to move to another section to continue 
the story.
Share visual(s)
The user decides to take a screen shot and then e-mail all 
or part of the data viz to someone else for the purpose of 
gaining collective knowledge or delegating next steps.
	
Although Table 10-1 doesn’t cover every scenario, the list accounts for about 
80 percent of the actions a user will take. In this book, we focus on making 
the actions of using a menu selector or moving to another section intuitive 
and easy for the user to follow.
To finish defining the functionality, simply ask yourself “What happens next?” 
until the user makes a decision. Intelligent data helps users make faster 
decisions.
Choosing navigation by using rules
Imagine having a business that can’t be found using one of the popular GPS 
systems, such as Google Maps. Revenue will suffer, and the business could 
fail. The same applies to a data viz that has poor navigation. If users can’t 
find their data with little to no effort, they’re not coming back. You have to 
make it crystal clear where you want them to go to see the complete story.
	
One way to do this is to add navigation to your mock-up. Usually, you add 
navigation to a data viz through a combination of menus, images, and words.
The good news for data-viz geeks is that the web development industry has 
tested and set standards and rules for effective ways to include navigation in 
any user interface.

 Chapter 10: Adding Functionality and Applying Color 
Take a look at the navigation on two popular websites. The site shown in 
Figure 10-1 has the navigation across the top and on the left side, and the 
site shown in Figure 10-2 has the navigation at the top. Both locations are 
common. Just go to any of your favorite sites, and it’s likely that you’ll see 
the same setup.

It’s also important to note that some data visualizations may not need naviga­
tion because they just display data for the purposes of monitoring. A good 
example of this specific type of data visualization is a dashboard that is used 
to monitor the number of calls in queue at a call center. The user can take a 
glance at the data viz on the wall and become aware that he probably needs 
to wrap up the existing call to be able to address the calls in queue.
The logic behind where to place the navigation on your data viz — be it at the 
top, left, or bottom rather than in the middle — has to do with the way that 
most humans read information. Most people tend to read from left to right in 
a Z pattern, as shown in Figure 10-3.

Figure 10-3: The proven reading pattern of most people is in a Z pattern.
Identifying the most popular menu types
You may not realize how heavily dependent you are on menus to navigate 
your favorite apps and websites. Most people use up to a hundred menus a 
day without even realizing it! To ensure great navigation on your data viz, you 
need to choose the right menu type. These include
	
✓	Menu selectors: Including such items as drop-down menus, list boxes, 
radio buttons, and tabs
	
✓	Navigational icons: Arrows or text
We discuss each menu type in the following sections.
Menu selectors
A menu selector is a component such as a drop-down menu or list box that 
enables the user to filter and/or navigate through different data views on a 
given data visualization.

137
 Chapter 10: Adding Functionality and Applying Color 
The most common menu selectors used today include the following:
	
✓	Drop-down menus: Drop-down menus are among the most popular 
menu selectors because they’re compact and can display a long list of 
items. At times, however, you shouldn’t use a drop-down menu, like 
when the list of menu options is too long (30 or more), as shown in 
Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4: The drop-down menu has too many options and is too long.
	
✓	List boxes: Another very popular option is the list box. Used to display 
huge lists of data, list boxes are straightforward and work well with huge 
data sets, as shown in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5: A list box with a scroll bar is useful for long lists.

✓	Radio buttons: Radio buttons are less popular but work well when you 
have a small set of selections, as shown in Figure 10-6. We recommend 
avoiding this menu type if you have more than five options; the display 
could quickly exhibit data overload.
Figure 10-6: Typical radio-button menus.
	
✓	Tab sets (vertical or horizontal): The highest-level menu selector is a 
tab set. Tab sets are best used when you need to differentiate sections 
in a collection of visuals. You could use separate tabs to show the visu­
als for four sales regions (North, South, East, and West) in the same data 
viz, as shown in Figure 10-7.

 Chapter 10: Adding Functionality and Applying Color 
Navigational icons
Another way to provide navigation is to use icons, such as arrows or text, to 
guide the user (see Figure 10-8). These visual cues are easy to read and serve 
the same purpose as a street sign. They guide the user through the data viz.
Figure 10-8: Common navigation icons and words used to guide users.
Dipping Into Color
Choosing a color scheme can be one of the most daunting tasks in your data 
visualization journey. It’s the Achilles heel of most newbies. Whether you’re 
working with a user or simply trying to determine what combination to use in 
your own data viz, the task of choosing effective colors can be difficult.
Many things can go wrong during this phase, including overusing color, using 
the wrong colors, and using the right colors in all the wrong places.
We’ve experienced this “color anxiety” firsthand, so we’re going to share the 
best tricks we use to overcome this hurdle. The following guidelines not only 
eliminate guesswork but also significantly reduce the amount of time you 
spend choosing the best color for data viz.
Taking advantage of company branding guidelines
One way to determine the right colors is to use the company branding 
guidelines — a document that many companies develop to ensure that 
materials produced by the company always look the same. The marketing 
team usually owns this document, which clearly defines the company’s logo, 
specific colors, fonts, and even shapes or textures that are used on anything 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
that is branded as belonging to the company. If you’ve never heard of this 
document, or if you’ve heard of it but had no idea how it could be of any use 
to you, you’re in for a surprise. In the data-viz world, the company branding 
guidelines are life-savers, because they take most of the guesswork out of 
choosing a correct color scheme because you use the colors of the brand.
Two good examples of branding guidelines are shown in Figure 10-9 and 
Figure 10-10. Figure 10-9 displays a screenshot of the Google Visual Assets 
page (image found at www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Visual-
Assets-Guidelines-Part-1/9028077) along with a preview of Google 
Analytics (image found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/
commons/3/3f/Google_Analytics_Sample_Dashboard.jpg). Though 
Google’s branding is very simplistic, it does show how Google utilizes its own 
branding guideline in its analytics displays.
The left side of Figure 10-10 displays the brand standards for Ohio University. 
The right side of the figure is an infographic on the school’s website that 
utilizes the brand standard very precisely. Also notice the consistency in the 
website. The quickest way to get a feel for a company’s brand, especially in 
the absence of an available branding guideline, is to take a look at the com­
pany’s website. You can determine the colors and fonts by taking a peek at 
the page source code.

 Chapter 10: Adding Functionality and Applying Color 
Figure 10-10: The screen on the right is an example Ohio University’s publicly available branding 
standards in action.
Why are the branding guidelines such a big deal? You can use the same 
colors (usually available in pantone or RGB [red, green, blue] format) and use 
them in your data viz. See Chapter 10 for more on using color in your data 
visualization.
	
If you want to check out some examples of branding guidelines, the Logo 
Design Love website (www.logodesignlove.com/brand-identity-
style-guides) lists guidelines for some major organizations, including 
Walmart and Adobe.
Consider an example section of a sales mock-up. Here are the details we were 
provided regarding the logo guidelines:
Logo colors: Pantone Cool Gray 10
Company colors: Additional colors are red (Pantone 193), brown 
(Pantone 483), blue (Pantone 280), and green (Pantone 329). (See 
Figure 10-11.)

Figure 10-12 shows some of the colors provided in the company branding 
guidelines applied to Section 1 of our mock-up. It displays the current state, 
using two probability circles and a column chart, accompanied by a combina­
tion of words and a variety of sizes.
Figure 10-12: Mock-up section uses color from the company branding guidelines.
	
It’s important to note that the use of white space in a data viz enables the 
user to focus on what is important. Although dark backgrounds may seem to 
be attractive up front, over time, the user gets tired of trying to view almost-
neon text on a dark background. See Chapter 8 for more information.
Choosing colors without guidelines
On the Internet, you can find software to do just about anything — even 
select your color scheme! In the event that you don’t have access to a set of 
branding guidelines, you can use the following method to create your own 
color guidelines:

1.	Choose a color from the company’s logo as a base color.
	
	 When you’re in doubt, a color like blue is always a safe choice as it’s 
been proven to be among the top sales colors.
	
2.	Go to the Color Scheme Designer website (or some equivalent site).
	
	 Color Scheme Designer (http://colorschemedesigner.com), which 
is shown in Figure 10-13, is a free tool that suggests complementary 
colors.

After you’ve finalized your color scheme, you can apply the colors the same 
way you would if you had company branding guidelines.
Using RAG colors
Some colors in the data-viz color scheme are considered to be sacred, in that 
they’re used only for a specific purpose. These colors are known as RAG (red, 
amber, green) or alert colors, similar to the ones you see in traffic stoplights. 
They hold the same meanings in the data-viz world:
	
✓	Red means “Stop!” Red says that something is going wrong with one of 
your measurements. If the probability of hitting your sales goal drops 
below 50 percent, for example, the visual should display red to tell the 
user at a glance that this measure isn’t going as planned and requires 
immediate attention.

✓	Yellow means “Proceed with caution.” Yellow means that this measure­
ment needs to be monitored closely. Typically, some action should be 
taken before the measurement moves to red. Yellow is meant to drive 
proactive behavior.
	
✓	Green means “Everything is okay.” Usually, no action is required when 
a measurement is green. For this reason, we usually don’t show green 
status in a data viz; that way, the user won’t waste mental space.
Figure 10-16 shows how RAG colors are used.

Adding Some Finishing Touches
In This Chapter
▶	Making your links useful
▶	Remembering the legal stuff
▶	Seeing why visual cues matter
▶	Adding location information
B

efore you can sign off on your data viz as complete, it’s time to add a 
few finishing touches to make it user friendly. This chapter describes 
how to add useful links such as Print, Share, Help, and FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions).
You also need to include some legal verbiage to ensure that you cover all 
your bases and protect your artwork. Last, we explain how strategi­
cally adding visual cues and some location intelligence can add 
clarity and curb appeal to your data viz.
	
As always, the devil is in the details. Although adding a 
small element such as the Help link may seem trivial, 
it’s critical to the overall adoption and success of 
your data viz.
Choosing Useful Links
When it comes to determining what links to include, 
start with actions that you know every user wants to 
perform, such as Print, Share, and Help. Your goal is 
to make it as easy as possible for the user to perform 
these actions.
Where do you place those links on your data viz so that the user can easily 
find them, but they’re not in the way of the critical details you’re showing? 
The website design community has developed specific layout standards that 
you probably intuitively know, whether you realize it or not.

If you take a closer look at your three favorite websites, you’ll notice that all 
of them have three common areas:
	
✓	Header at the top: The company logo typically is located here. In some 
cases, the header includes a navigation bar and some useful links such 
as the Home, Share, and About links so that the visitor can easily move 
around the site.
	
✓	Body in the middle: This area is where the most important data on the 
page is displayed. It may also house some navigation.
	
✓	Footer at the bottom: The footer may include copyright labels, a link to 
a privacy policy, or a link to legal disclaimers, but it may also repeat a 
set of useful links that help users navigate the site.
	
Notice that useful links can be included in both the header and the footer of 
the visualization. Useful links have a clear call to action, and you should 
place them in easy-to-find locations on the data viz to save the user time and 
make your data viz easier to use.
Figure 11-1 shows the BIDashboardFormula.com website, outlining the 
header, body, and footer areas with some of the useful links we discuss in this 
chapter.

 Chapter 11: Adding Some Finishing Touches
Introducing six mandatory links
Although you can include many useful links in a data viz, we consider six 
links to be mandatory:
	
✓	Home
	
✓	Reset
	
✓	Print
	
✓	Share
	
✓	About
	
✓	Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
Some designers argue that these six links are nice to have but not necessary. 
But most users today expect to do more with less — fewer clicks to get to the 
home page, fewer clicks to share with friends. Including the six mandatory links 
makes it possible for users to get where they want to be as quickly as possible.
The following sections describe each of these mandatory links and explain 
where we recommend that you locate them.
Home
The Home link returns the user to a main page or the first page of your data viz. 
No matter how simple your data viz is, the user will always need to return home. 
We recommend that you place this link in the header, as shown in Figure 11-2.
The Home link
Figure 11-2: It’s useful to have a Home link on the top of your data viz.
	
Home links can have different purposes depending on the requirements of 
your visualization. If you have a one-page data viz, it may be appropriate to 
have the Home link take the user to the company’s intranet site. If the data 
viz has multiple pages, however, having a Home link to take the user back to 
page one is highly appropriate. Don’t forget to include it!
Reset
The Reset link returns the user to the original state of the data viz before he 
performed any action on the interactive visualization. When the user clicks the 
Reset link, the data viz is restored to its original state. This enables the user to 
start from the beginning of the data viz with the single click of a button.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
The Reset button usually sits in the top-right corner of a data viz, as shown in 
Figure 11-3. This location makes it easy for users to spot. When the links are 
well designed and properly arranged, the header usually doesn’t become too 
congested with links, buttons, or content.
The Reset link
Figure 11-3: A Reset link makes it easy for the user to reset all the settings 
on the data viz and start from scratch.
Print
The Print function is becoming less popular due to the global push for com­
panies to go green, but it is still a must. Some organizations continue to rely 
on printed reports; consequently, it’s imperative that you make it easy for 
users to print your visualization.
As shown in Figure 11-4, the Print link usually sits in the top-right corner. 
It can be represented by a print icon rather than a text link to reduce the 
amount of real estate it takes up.
The Print link
Figure 11-4: Example of the Print icon on the top right of a data viz.
	
In some rare cases, you may need to include a more customized Print link. 
Most Print links default to a portrait shape, whereas most data visualizations 
require a landscape setting to fit on a standard page.

Be sure to test your Print link. You want to ensure that the user doesn’t get 
stuck figuring out how to configure the data viz in the print preview settings.
Share
The Share link is one of the newest links in the bunch, but it has become one 
of the most important. Social collaboration has become part of many users’ 
lives. Sharing links increases productivity by allowing users to delegate tasks, 
gather opinions from other stakeholders, and accelerate the decision-making 
process. By being able to share and discuss their views on a specific area of 
the data viz, users can use social collaboration to combine their knowledge 
and make faster and more informed decisions.
At minimum, you can program a Share link to enable users to share screen shots 
from their e-mail accounts. When a user clicks a simple link like the one shown 
in Figure 11-5, a new e-mail message launches automatically. In some cases, the 
Share link enables the user to send the visualization directly to the company’s 
internal social networking account. In the example shown in Figure 11-5, when 
the user clicks the link, she will be able to choose among the available social 
networking options, such as E-mail, Post to Yammer, and Post to Chatter.
The Share link
Figure 11-5: The Share link enables users to connect to some popular 
internal company social networks, such as Yammer and Chatter.
On most websites, the Share link is in the header (refer to Figure 11-5), 
although you can also place it in the footer of your data viz. Your primary 
objective is to make it easy for your users to collaborate.
	
The Share link doesn’t have to be a text link. Another effective and popular 
method is to use an icon, such as an envelope, or individual social-media icons 
that indicate which social networks the user can share with. Figure 11-6 shows 
a site that includes icons for sharing via Facebook, Twitter, and an RSS feed.

More information
Although some designers feel that the More Information link is optional, we 
believe that it’s important to include it to provide background or supplemen­
tal information. When the user clicks the About link, she sees helpful informa­
tion such as the purpose of the data viz, who owns it, and any background 
details that may help her better understand the visualization.
More Information links are often in the headers of websites, and the same 
holds true for data visualizations, as shown in Figure 11-7. One school of 
thought is that the About link should be displayed in the footer because it’s 
less important than the links that are placed in the header. That said, it’s 
really up to your preference and the available real estate on the data viz.
More Information
Figure 11-7: On this data viz, the More Information link is an icon.
If your data viz project has a small audience, you probably can engage all your 
users during the entire BI Dashboard Formula process. However, when it comes 
to Big Data and big enterprises, it is virtually impossible to get your entire audi­
ence involved. On projects for which you haven’t been able to engage all users 
during the development of your data visualization, a More Information link that 
provides solid details about the project is important for establishing credibility 
and also for providing context for what is being displayed.
Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
The FAQ link is also on most websites, and it’s critical for every data viz. 
It’s virtually impossible to answer all the questions any user may have, but 
you make the user’s life much easier when you provide answers to the top 
ten questions on an FAQ page. It can be shown as an icon or a text label, as 
shown in Figure 11-8.
Information in the FAQ may range from explaining how to complete some 
tasks with the interactive elements of the visualization to telling users where 
to find a particular element. You may decide to include contact information in 
case a user needs additional help.
	
Ideally, you want to order the questions based on how frequently they’re 
asked. When you first launch your data viz, you may find it challenging to 
arrange the questions in order of importance. When you’re unsure of the 
order, take an educated guess and then arrange the questions in order of 
importance based on information you receive during the user testing phase. 
You can also run the final list by your super-users to request their feedback.

 Chapter 11: Adding Some Finishing Touches
The FAQ link usually sits neatly next to the About link. As it has a good 
deal of textual information, it usually works best as a pop-up or mouseover 
window.
The FAQ link is a great place to include general information, clarification 
on any important items, or a brief explanation of how to use the data viz. 
If you want a more visual representation for your FAQ and other help 
information, or if you are tight on available space, consider using a ? 
(question mark) link.
	
Some data viz experts suggest that the need to include an FAQ button is a 
sign that the data viz is too complex and therefore requires a manual to assist 
the user. Based on our experience, no matter how clean your data viz is, 
users always have questions — some of which may seem trivial. The main 
goal of the FAQ is to help users address those questions as fast as possible so 
that they can proceed with reviewing the data viz. It’s better to make the 
information readily accessible than to have users who are frustrated because 
they have questions for which they can’t easily find answers.
	
You should consider the FAQ section to be a living part of the data viz that 
is subject to change based on the feedback you receive from users after 
the data viz is launched. In addition, be receptive to requests about the 
context, definition, or location of any component of your data viz. Some of 
those requests may turn into refinements of your data viz; others will be 
information that you can add to the FAQs.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Including a last updated timestamp
	
With the rise of Big Data, users need to have real-time information available 
because they depend on the latest and greatest data to drive proactive 
decision-making. Working from old data — which is what most organizations 
are still doing — undermines the value of your data viz and usually leads to 
reactive decision-making. Ideally, you want the data to update every time a 
user logs in to review the data so that he can make timely decisions about 
the appropriate course of action.
You can easily let users know the last time the data was refreshed by includ­
ing that information as simple text. You can display it in terms of month, day, 
and year or hours, minutes, and seconds. The Last Updated information is 
particularly useful for your users who view the data on a regular basis. It 
provides an idea of how fresh or reliable the current data is.
The most popular location for this information is at the right end of the 
footer, as shown in Figure 11-9. (You could include it in the header instead, 
if you prefer.) Typically it is displayed using a small font. You want to make 
the information available if the user is looking for it, but you do not want it 
to distract from the more important components of the visualization.
The Last Updated
 information
Figure 11-9: The last updated timestamp is usually in the footer.
Many organizations pull data from multiple sources, and it’s often difficult to 
have all the data updated at the same time. If your data viz is built from multiple 
sources, you can provide Last Updated information in two ways:
	
✓	Display the oldest date: By providing the last updated date of the system 
with the oldest data, the user gets an idea of how old the most out-of-date 
piece of information is. This solution is generic, but it’s a good start to 
addressing the issues created when you’re using multiple data sources.
	
✓	Display individually updated dates and times: Although it may prove to 
be complex and may add clutter if you execute it incorrectly, an alterna­
tive solution is to display the last updated date and time for each 
section or measure of your data viz.
	
You want to include the most up-to-date and frequently refreshed information 
at the forefront of your data viz, with less-frequently updated details at the 
side or bottom of your data viz.

 Chapter 11: Adding Some Finishing Touches
Adding Legal Stuff
Like any good piece of art or specialized system, your data viz is a valuable 
piece of your company’s intellectual property. Therefore, it’s critical that 
you include some information to protect the user and the distribution of the 
data viz.
Two important pieces of information that you may want to include to protect 
your company are the copyright and the terms and conditions.
Embracing the copyright
Some people believe that including a copyright on a data viz is optional 
because it consumes too much space. We recommend that you always add 
one, however.
Any data viz that you produce automatically becomes the property of your 
company. In the age of social collaboration and sharing, it’s easy for a screen 
shot of a data viz to float outside company walls. For this reason, you must 
ensure that anyone outside the company who views this data viz is aware of 
the following facts:
	
✓	The data viz is the legal property of your company.
	
✓	The data viz should not be used without permission from your company 
unless otherwise stated.
The footer is the most appropriate place for copyright information (see 
Figure 11-10); that’s the location where many websites place it. Like the Last 
Updated text, the copyright text should be big enough that it’s legible but 
small enough that it doesn’t draw attention away from the data viz itself.
The copyright 
information
Figure 11-10: The copyright information is often placed in the footer.
	
Mico has seen individuals illegally use screen shots of data visualizations in 
presentations. In one severe case, this led to a lawsuit. Millions of dollars in 
damages were awarded to the company who owned the copyright of the 
data viz that was illegally used. It’s better to be safe than sorry, which is why 
we advise you to include a copyright on all your data visualizations.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Delving into terms and conditions
Another useful link that you may want to include in your data viz is Terms 
and Conditions. The terms and conditions spell out how and when the data 
viz may be used outside its intended use.
Similar to any content-rich piece of work, such as a company’s profit and 
loss statement or the marketing ROI (return on investment) sheet, a data 
visualization often contains sensitive information that should not be viewed 
outside the company. By defining who may review and use the visualization 
in the terms and conditions, you legally define what is acceptable from a use 
standpoint. Explicitly stating the guidelines makes anyone who goes against 
the defined terms of use liable for legal damages.
	
To avoid attracting the user’s attention unnecessarily, you should format the 
Terms and Conditions link in a small font so that it doesn’t draw attention 
away from the important content of the data viz. Preferably you should place 
it in the footer, as shown in Figure 11-11. To keep things simple, we recom­
mend linking to your company’s Terms and Conditions text on the company 
website.
The terms and 
conditions link
Figure 11-11: Terms and Conditions link.
	
Although including these links to legal information may seem to be a bit 
out of scope, you’d be surprised by how easily data visualizations can be 
misused. The safest approach is to contact your company’s legal department 
and get specific wording for the terms and conditions information. Be proactive.
Discovering Visual Cues
Have you ever taken a long road trip? You probably remember seeing road 
signs warning you of upcoming construction zones, accidents, or other unex­
pected roadblocks that required you to modify your original plans. We’re 
sure that you were grateful to see signs like “Construction 5 miles ahead on 
left,” which provided you enough notice to decide to proceed forward and 
risk being delayed or to find an alternative route. Those types of road signs

 Chapter 11: Adding Some Finishing Touches
are calls to action. They enable you to decide which route to take so you can 
avoid being stuck in a construction-zone traffic jam.
Like road signs, visual cues in data visualizations are helpful to users. Visual 
cues are combinations of text and shapes that are strategically placed to 
draw attention to a specific area or enforce a call to action.
Figure 11-12 shows an example of some popular visual cues that may be used to 
draw the user’s attention to various exceptions or calls to action in a data viz.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
The most effective visual cues are dynamic and appear only when needed. 
As shown in Figure 11-12, effective visual cues are often a good combina­
tion of colors and shapes. They can be graphical icons or only text. The one 
common theme is that they stand out at a glance.
	
One common method of providing visual cues is through conditional format­
ting or alerts. Colors can imply what the current situation is. Red, for exam­
ple, automatically implies some type of problem or risk associated with a 
given area or measurement. Green, on the other hand, implies that all is well 
and no further action is required. See Chapter 10 for more information about 
using color in your visualizations.
Adding Location Intelligence
Geographic apps, such as Google Maps, help people find their way around 
unfamiliar locations via mobile devices. One particularly useful app called 
Waze uses social collaboration, in which drivers inform one another of cur­
rent road conditions. These types of navigation apps have given rise to the 
concept of location intelligence, which is the mashup of information that can 
be used to provide enriched data for navigating the world.
Although the specific use cases for including location intelligence in your 
data viz are broad, it’s important not to get distracted by the alluring nature 
of maps and ensure that you truly have a good use case first. This chapter 
takes a look at a few areas where maps can be used to help organizations gain 
critical insights and make better decisions.
Figure 11-13 shows how you can use a combination of branding and visual 
cues to make your data viz compelling. This coffee data viz displays some 
very interesting stats about the world’s coffee consumption.
Traditional data visualization best practices consider maps to be an inef­
ficient way to display data because they use too much real estate on an 
already-limited screen. Although we agree that some maps don’t make 
efficient use of space, we feel that as the use of mobile devices with built-in 
location tracking evolves, there are good uses for maps in the world of data 
viz. Some effective use cases for maps include the following:
	
✓	Transportation: Data involving any kind of motor vehicle or fleet is a 
great scenario for using maps.
	
✓	Retail: Indoor mapping is a hot topic that continues to gain steam as 
technology evolves. Putting intelligence around foot traffic in a retail 
store can tell a company a lot about their consumers.

 Chapter 11: Adding Some Finishing Touches
	
✓	Financial: Looking at financial data geographically is a great way to identify 
areas for improvement or trends in specific regions.
	
✓	Marketing: Demographic information in the marketing world has deter­
mined where and when advertisers choose to place their valuable ads. 
With the rise of built-in location technology, it’s easier than ever for 
advertisers to target the correct markets for their ads.
Compared with traditional charts and graphs, maps are a lot easier for users 
to digest. Their interactive nature helps users who are already accustomed to 
touching a screen to make changes. The widespread popularity of Google has 
made using maps a familiar and comfortable experience for many users.
We consider incorporating location intelligence to be a luxury in the data 
visualization world right now, although in the near future, it may become the 
norm as mobile use continues to grow and Big Data continues to call for more 
innovative ways for data to be presented.

Exploring User Adoption
In This Chapter
▶	Encouraging user adoption
▶	Measuring user adoption
▶	Marketing to increase adoption rates
E

verything you’ve done up to this point has been preparation to meet 
your most important goal: getting a high user adoption rate for your 
data visualization. Although this may seem obvious, user adoption (UA) is an 
afterthought in many organizations. It’s the thing that everyone focuses on 
after the solution is rolled out to users.
Big companies in particular invest millions of dollars in business intelligence 
(BI) solutions, which includes developing and deploying data visualizations. 
But they drop the ball when trying to facilitate high UA rates. 
They squander both their limited budget and the opportu­
nity to ensure that users get insights from the data.
According to a study done by Cindi Howson, a well-
known BI analyst, author, and founder of BIScorecard 
(http://biscorecard.com), the average UA rate 
for data visualizations is between 25 and 35 percent. 
Contributing factors to the low adoption rates 
were tool complexity (existing tools are too hard 
for users to use), lack of agility (existing systems 
make it difficult to adjust to ever-changing business 
needs), and lack of collaboration during the process. 
You can read more about the barriers to user adoption

In addition, a BI report posted by Gartner in February 2012 estimates that 
70 percent of global business intelligence projects undertaken between 2012 
and 2014 will fail. Those odds aren’t very encouraging if your project includes 
data visualizations.
This chapter explains what UA is and how to avoid UA traps. It also provides 
suggestions of things that will help increase your user adoption rate.
Understanding User Adoption
User adoption (UA) is defined as the measure of how much of the intended 
audience uses the provided solution (in this case, the data visualization). 
This concept gets a bit murky, however, when you delve into what should 
actually be measured. Should you measure how many times the data viz is 
being viewed or the average length of time for which the data is viewed? 
Perhaps you should measure how many times the data is used to conduct 
exploratory activities.
	
The secret of measuring UA is that UA is a combination of many elements. 
In the business data world, UA isn’t just a measure of use but also a measure 
of the value added to a user.
Considering Five UA Measurements
As you begin to analyze UA rates, you need to understand the following five 
metrics:
	
✓	Frequency of use: Frequency of use measures the number of times an 
individual user uses your data viz. To gain an accurate number, you want 
to make this metric an average based on overall frequency of use.
	
✓	Interval of frequency of use: This measures when your data viz is actu­
ally being used, as in time of day, month, quarter, year, and so on. For 
example, you could look at data that has been used between January 
2013 and December 2013. Interval of frequency of use involves how often 
the data being displayed is updated, but it should measure when users 
access the data viz and perhaps when they find the most value.
	
✓	Area of frequency of use: This metric is one of the most important to 
consider. It tells you which sections of the data viz users visit most. It 
also tells you what areas need to be enhanced or removed from future 
updates. Finally, it provides a clear focus on what is most valuable to 
the user. When you see what is used and what is ignored, you get a clear 
idea about what is truly useful to viewers.

 Chapter 12: Exploring User Adoption
	
✓	Type of use: Measuring how a data viz is actually being used may be a 
bit tricky, but it’s critical to the long-term adoption and success of the 
tool. If you build a data viz that has drill-down capability, and no one 
ever clicks to go to more details, that particular feature (or type of use) 
isn’t providing much value to the user.
	
	Unfortunately, many of the data viz tools or systems in the market lack 
the ability to track UA metrics. We recommend doing monthly or quar­
terly polls or surveys of your users to gain insight into how, when, and 
for what purpose the data viz is being used. Doing your own investiga­
tion is the only sure-fire way to ensure that you can provide continuous 
improvements to your data viz so that it will be continually used by your 
audience.
	
	If you find that users are frequently exporting the raw data in a visualiza­
tion, that’s a clear indication that users don’t trust the data viz itself and 
are using the data viz as nothing more than an export tool. This measure 
in conjunction with the frequency of use metric tells you a lot about the 
actual value, or lack thereof, that the users are getting from the data viz.
	
✓	Number of total users compared with targeted audience size: This 
metric is perhaps the most popular measure of user adoption and is 
best measured as a percentage. You derive it by taking the total count of 
the intended audience and the number of users who are actually using 
the data viz and expressing that figure as a percentage. Suppose that 
you build a data viz for a sales organization of 500 people. If 50 of those 
people access the data viz on a regular basis, you have a 10 percent 
UA rate.
Marketing to Data Viz Users
If you think that when you’re done building your data viz that you can simply 
send an e-mail with the subject “The Sales Pulse app is now available” and 
users will come flocking, you’re going to be very disappointed. This scenario 
almost never happens. In fact, you can count on users meeting your e-mail 
with great indifference.
	
One study found that most applications or solutions that are built for busi­
ness users have low adoption rates simply because the users were never 
aware of the application to begin with. You have to put some effort into 
making your audience aware of your product and the ways that users can 
benefit from it.
To combat low UA rates, the first thing you need to do is put on your 
marketing hat. Just like marketing e-mails and thousands of ads that users 
are exposed to on a daily basis, users will see your data viz as just another app.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
It won’t stand out unless you do something to market it. To gain the attention 
of your audience, you need to provide a reason for them to use your data viz 
and then provide reasons for them to return to it repeatedly.
We have some foolproof ways to boost UA. Many of the suggestions are part 
of our BI Dashboard Formula (BIDF) program. The following sections list 
some of the most important techniques for marketing to your users.
Ensure data availability and accuracy
This technique is of key importance. If users can’t trust your data, your data 
viz will never be used. Period. Ensure that your data viz is always painting 
accurate pictures of the correct data. If the data is found to be unavailable or 
unreliable for any reason, users are unlikely to revisit the data viz.
To help users believe that your data is reliable, you can look at the data from 
two different perspectives. They are:
	
✓	Internal company data: Typically when you use internal data you want 
to work hand in hand with your IT department to select the most cur­
rent, error-free data. They will know what holes exist in the data they 
have. Establish a good working relationship with them so that they will 
freely tell you the good and bad about the data. If you point fingers or 
try to blame them for what’s missing, you will ensure failure. You also 
want to make sure that they have been told that your project is a high 
priority or they may relegate your requests to the end of a long queue.
	
✓	External data from government agencies and other public or private 
sources: If you are using this type of data, make sure to provide the 
source notes. Some users may want to look at the raw data themselves 
just to be sure it’s trustworthy. Others will take your word for it, but if 
you have no references, you run the risk of appearing unserious, and the 
data viz will be discarded.
Use buy-in and ownership to engage users
You want to ensure that you’re targeting the correct key performance indica­
tors (KPIs) and gaining the audience’s buy-in. This is also critical from future 
advertising and word-of-mouth standpoints. Users will tell others about the 
value of your data viz, which will help others find and use it.
Give each data viz the right name
We can’t emphasize enough how important a name is. This is certainly true of 
book titles and movies. Also, think about how many e-mails and Twitter hash 
tags go viral because of their titles.

 Chapter 12: Exploring User Adoption
Great data visualizations use words that directly describe what they show. 
Consider the fact that many people around the world have been told by their 
doctors to cut down on their salt intake. Figure 12-1 shows a visualization 
called Salt Mountains, in which salt intake is represented by peaks of various 
heights. The catchy title goes a long way toward grabbing the interest of 
readers. You can see the original image at www.nextgenerationfood.com/
news/salt-levels-in-our-food.
Use internal social media platforms and intranets
Many organizations have internal social media platforms, such as Salesforce 
Chatter and Yammer (https://www.yammer.com), which is like a corporate 
version of Facebook for enterprises.
As soon as a data-viz project launches, create an internal company group by 
using a tool such as Yammer and invite your team to join the community. It’s 
a great way to create excitement by
	
✓	Posting regular visual updates
	
✓	Adding new screen shots
	
✓	Starting conversations about a particular data viz
	
✓	Highlighting the comments of expert users
	
Using a social network to discuss upcoming meetings or interesting trends in 
the data is a great way to attract other users and provide a place for the data 
viz to grow and attract new users.

Part III: Building Your First Data Visualization 
Go live on internal platforms
You should treat the announcement of your data viz as you would treat the 
marketing for a product launch. Depending on the size of your audience, the 
cost of the data viz, and effort required, you may be able to go live on a social 
media platform. Your announcement can be as simple as conducting a short 
webinar for users or as big as a formal event with keynote speakers, prizes, 
and live use cases presented by your superusers (the major stakeholders).
Do away with training
When someone says that he’s going to train users to use his data viz, that 
statement is a sure sign that he’s living in the Dinosaur Age. Ease of use 
(EOU) is in, and training is out! With the emergence of apps that take two 
seconds to download and another three seconds to start using, few people 
will tolerate the need for training. That’s why keeping things simple is so 
important. Apps are successful because they do one thing, and they do it 
very well. Follow the same line of thinking for your data viz, and it will prove 
to be successful.
Make sure that the data viz looks great
A house that’s for sale needs to have curb appeal; it has to look good from 
the street so that buyers will want to check out the inside. In the same way, 
your data viz needs to look good so that people will want to dive deeper into 
it. Without providing an attractive package, you won’t be able to get users to 
enter the data viz, so why would you expect them to use it? Having a good 
user interface is a must.
Provide 24/7 accessibility
Allowing users to access your data viz anytime and anywhere is critical 
for user adoption. With the click or tap of a button, they should be able to 
view and use your data viz regardless of what device they’re using: a mobile 
device, a tablet, a company laptop, or a desktop computer.
Provide speed and reliability
Yes, speed is a huge factor! Just imagine accessing an app on your phone and 
then having to wait a long time for it to load, but it crashes after 10 seconds. 
Most users instantly delete an app that performs that way, and a smaller 
percentage of users will take the extra step of providing bad feedback in a 
review. The same goes for your data viz. If your data viz doesn’t work cor­
rectly and quickly, you can expect users to give up on using it — or, worse, 
to spread the word to other users that the data viz is a dud.

 Chapter 12: Exploring User Adoption
A Gartner report released about 7 years ago stated that the average user 
has a 5- to 8-second attention span, after which he or she simply switches 
to something else. Based on our experience, we would even suggest that the 
evolution of smartphones has reduced the average user attention span to as 
low as 2 seconds. This means that if you’re unable to load data within that 
time frame, you’ll lose most of your users. If the data viz crashes, it’s likely 
that the users are never going to return and that they’ll lose confidence in the 
application and in you.
Speed the delivery of your data viz
Delivering your data viz in a short cycle is a key component of building and 
maintaining momentum with your user base. You can use this momentum to 
build interest for future releases. We recommend that you deliver even the 
most complex data viz in two to three months maximum and tag it as a proof 
of concept. This usually sets the stage for great future releases and opens 
discussions about how to further enhance the application.
	
Taking six months to a year to build and release your first data viz is a 
surefire way to ensure that you’ll have no users.

Evaluating Real Data 
Visualizations
In This Chapter
▶	Using a data viz worksheet
▶	Analyzing examples of data visualizations
I

t’s easy to look at data visualizations in a superficial way and just 
enjoy the effect of the visuals. Some visualizations are dazzlingly 
interactive; others are funny or clever. But when it comes to real-
world business data, the stakes are high.
The true power of a data visualization is realized when it provides 
insight, tells a story, and sheds light on key issues. These insights 
would be overlooked if they were presented in other, less 
visual formats.
In this chapter, we provide a worksheet that you can 
use to evaluate data visualizations, whether you cre­
ated them or someone else did. We also show you 
some real examples of data visualizations so that 
you can see what works and what doesn’t. Feel 
free to try out the worksheet as you examine the 
examples!
Analyzing Data Visualizations 
by Category
There’s no better way to build confidence in your own data viz 
choices than to know how to evaluate what you’re looking at. A work­
sheet that guides you through the major data viz categories is a must.

We’ve compiled the categories into Table 13-1, which you can use as a work­
sheet as you’re evaluating data visualizations that you use or create. The cat­
egories we’ve included in the worksheet are described in detail later in this 
chapter. As you evaluate data visualizations, make notes about your impres­
sions of how the data viz succeeds (or falls short) in each of the categories.
The following sections describe the categories in detail.

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Real Data Visualizations
Big-picture considerations
The big-picture considerations are the general ones that you make about 
design, quantity of data, and format when you’re beginning to create your 
data viz. These considerations include
	
✓	Simplicity: Simplicity is key to making your data viz usable. You want to 
eliminate everything that isn’t essential. Don’t use a feature just because 
it looks pretty. Everything in your data viz must have a function.
	
✓	Data overload: Bombarding your user with too much data is as bad as 
not giving the user enough data. Test your visualizations with a small 
focus group to see whether users are overwhelmed by the quantity of 
data. If they are, you know that you need to make changes before releas­
ing the data viz to your full audience.
	
✓	Chart choice: The type of chart you use is important. It can be helpful 
to try several types of charts before you decide which one is best. When 
you place your specific data into a chart type, you can check to see 
whether the visual representation enhances or obscures the story the 
data is telling.
	
✓	Metadata: Metadata is information about the source of your data. It 
tells you when you obtained the data, for example, or where you got it. 
Metadata helps you give context to your user. Without context, the user 
has to make up his own interpretation of the data viz, which wastes time 
and could be incorrect.
Color
Color has a major impact on your data viz, so you want to choose wisely. In 
“Evaluating Data Visualizations,” later in this chapter, we present several data 
visualizations that demonstrate poor color choices. You’ll see that the colors 
used instantly deflate the value of the data viz.
Whatever colors you choose, you have to be consistent in how you apply 
them. You’re probably familiar with the idea of color coding, in which a par­
ticular color stands for one concept. You can have blue signify sales data, for 
example. Every time you use blue, the users know that they’re looking at data 
about sales. If you’re consistent in how you apply color, you help your users 
understand data at a glance.
Design issues
Understanding some key design issues makes creating a data viz easier:
	
✓	White space: One important component of any good design is white 
space. In the various visualizations that we show later in this chapter, 
you see that effective use of white space helps separate a good data viz 
from a bad one.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
	
✓	Layout: You must decide how the features of your data viz will be laid 
out before you start positioning data. Check out an example of a good 
layout in data visualization 6, later in this chapter.
	
✓	Tables: Think carefully about using tables in a data viz, and use them in 
small doses. Using a big table defeats the purpose of using visuals.
	
✓	Icons: Icons are great communicators, but don’t get carried away with 
stylish ones that add no real meaning.
	
✓	Duplication: Duplicating data is a waste of important real estate. Err on 
the side of simplicity.
	
✓	Discrete sections: Make sure that data items don’t overlap so that data 
won’t be misinterpreted.
	
✓	Personalization: As you see in data visualization 8, later in this chapter, 
the use of a personal photo enhances the entire visualization as well as 
provides useful information.
	
We cover each of the following topics in more detail in Chapter 6.
Text formatting
Text plays a critical role in giving your data viz the context users need to 
quickly understand what’s being displayed. When you add text, pay attention 
to the following aspects:
	
✓	Size: If text is too small or too large, it interferes with users’ understand­
ing of the data viz. Don’t make people squint!
	
✓	Labels: Clear labels make a huge difference, but data viz designers often 
forget to include them because they think that everyone in the audience 
knows what’s being shown. Your users shouldn’t have to solve a mys­
tery to get to the true meaning of your data viz. Use explicit labels.
	
✓	Consistency: Using too many font styles, colors, and sizes can make 
your data viz look like a ransom note. Limit yourself to two fonts, and be 
consistent in their use.
	
✓	Cut-off text: Text that runs off the edge of the data viz or that’s covered 
by a graphic is a serious blunder. Don’t make your users guess what the 
text says. They may guess incorrectly, and that outcome could be as bad 
as the outcome of providing incorrect data.

Menus
Most users spend a lot of time online; consequently, they have certain expecta­
tions about how menus work. Your users rely on the menus in your data viz to 
navigate the data you’re providing, so the way you use the menus is important. 
You need to take the following aspects of your data viz into consideration:
	
✓	Location of menu options: Intuitively, you know that the locations of 
menu options are critical to their use. Look at other data visualizations 
to see how other designers implement menus.
	
✓	Filtering: Filtering removes nonessential data. It sets parameters like 
date range or data type. You want to prevent your users from having to 
sift through one big data dump. It’s just as important to determine what 
data goes out as it is to determine what goes in.
Interactivity
When you make it possible for users to use interactive features to drill down 
and get exactly what they need from a data viz, you ensure that they’ll return 
to the visualization on a regular basis. It’s essential to figure out how a data 
viz will be used before you create any interactive features. The following list 
describes some types of interactivity you can consider:
	
✓	Develop what-if scenarios. Talk to major stakeholders about the sce­
narios that they believe are most important. What-if simulations can 
produce great insights into how users will work with the visualization.
	
✓	Implement location intelligence. Location intelligence is the capability 
of the data viz to sort data according to location (see Chapter 11). When 
you mash up data with its location, you can pull out insights that you 
wouldn’t see if you weren’t combing location data with your primary data. 
You would have no way to determine that sales were very high in a small 
region in the Northwest, for example, unless you could parse that data. 
You ­certainly couldn’t guess at what the location was without identifying it.
Design for mobile
As we discuss in Chapter 6, mobile layouts are no longer optional. You need 
to test your data visualizations to make sure that they’re readable on tablets, 
smartphones, and other portable devices.
	
Responsive design refers to a layout’s capability to modify according to the 
device on which it’s being viewed. It’s key to have grids that can be reformed 
for each device. Visual presentations on the web and mobile devices rely on 
a standard way of placing items called a grid. If the grid resizes itself properly 
on each device, the design remains intact.
In addition, images must be flexible so that none of the data is cut off. This 
means that if an image is able to make itself proportionately smaller or larger 
to fit the screen, you don’t lose any part of the image.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Evaluating Data Visualizations
In this section, we provide ten visualizations and describe what’s good and 
bad about each of them. Keep Table 13-1 handy so that you can see how we 
evaluate each category.
Data visualization 1
Figure 13-1 shows a dashboard that analyzes the status of domestic loans 
in the United States. The original image is here: http://data-informed.
com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tableau-illo-Domestic_Loan_
Analysis-650x438.jpg.
Slider for interactivity
Figure 13-1: Domestic loans in the United States.
Things that work well:
	
✓	Color consistency: One thing that’s evident throughout this visualization 
is the consistency of the colors in the dashboard. On the right is a single 
legend — Highlight Segment — that shows the legend for the color, which 
remains in both the bar chart at the bottom and the pie charts on the map.
	
✓	Simplicity: The two large charts make digesting the data easy.
	
✓	Interactivity: The slider in the top-right corner controls the time period 
displayed on the charts. That interactive feature puts users in control of 
what they view.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

177
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Chart choice: The small pie charts that are overlaid on the map are of 
little value. They’re hard to view, and without clicking every single one, 
the user can’t determine which of them are worth evaluating. It’s also 
virtually impossible to tell which states or regions the charts pertain to.
	
✓	Color choice: The abundant use of red, blue, and orange are misleading, 
especially in the stacked bar chart at the bottom of the data viz. At a 
glance, users may think that the colors could mean good versus bad; in 
fact, they’re just associated with a specific segment. This type of color 
usage harkens back to our recommendation about being careful with the 
use of RAG colors (see Chapter 10). An alternative is to use more muted 
colors, such as a range of grays and blues.
	
✓	Data overload: There’s a lot of data on the screen, but none of it really iden­
tifies the most important data or trends that users need to pay attention to. 
This visualization displays data for viewing instead of adding real value.
Data visualization 2

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Things that work well:
	
✓	Colors: The colors are very safe. The dark brown background comple­
ments the colors in the charts.
	
✓	White space: The use of white space makes the chart data easy to read.
	
✓	Icons: The icons, such as the mannequins with coats and the tablet, 
really help emphasize that they are business owners. Notice the use of 
a mobile phone’s outline to hold some of the statistical data.
	
✓	Interactivity: Allowing users to view and change the number of employees 
and thereby modify the data on all the charts is a nice interactive touch.
Things that don’t work:
The component of this visualization that works least well is text size. 
Although the titles are clearly marked, the text in some areas is small, which 
makes it hard to read.
	
Don’t compromise font size in the interest of adding more text. Instead, find a 
simpler way to add the text.
Data visualization 3
Figure 13-3 shows the SalesForce data visualization, which shows the 
names of the salespeople and the size of the deal they have either closed 
or have pending. You can view the original image here: http://eu.demo.
qlikview.com/QvAJAXZfc/opendoc.htm?document=qvdocs%2FSales
force.qvw&host=Demo11&anonymous=true.
Things that work well:
	
✓	White space: White space separates the graphical areas and text, which 
is especially important in a data visualization with a lot of metadata 
(information about the data itself).
	
✓	Text size: The larger fonts emphasize the most important values, which 
stand out from the less important information.
	
✓	Color choice: The legend for the color and story of the journey is very 
clearly labeled at the top left as past (red), present (gold), and future 
(green). The use of color in this visualization is understandable and 
consistent.
	
✓	Text labels: The bold text labels clearly show what each section dis­
plays. Notice the consistency of the text size and the colors of the labels 
at each level, from top to bottom.

Top 3 pending 
opps Q1 and Q2
Figure 13-3: SalesForce.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Chart choice: The most confusing part of this data viz is the use of 
charts, particularly the one in the middle. A closer look shows that the 
charts in the middle repeat the charts on the left and the right. Although 
it’s clear that the author is trying to show how the past and future com­
pare with the present, repeating charts seldom provides much value.
	
	Duplication is a waste of valuable real estate.
	
✓	Cut-off text: Notice that the names of the top-three pending “opps” are 
cut off. Cutting off text on a data viz can make it very hard for users to 
read. In a large organization, it’s unlikely that everyone will be familiar 
with every piece of data in a visualization, such as the opportunity name 
in this case.
	
	When you follow the Business Intelligence Dashboard Formula (BIDF) 
blueprint, you begin by asking for the short names that you can use on 
the data viz. Knowing how to abbreviate terminology helps you avoid 
cut-off text.
	
✓	Metadata: The data is well laid out, but there’s still a lot of it. This data 
viz gives a complete picture, but it’s hard to determine on first viewing 
whether there are any real problems.
	
	Because there’s so much metadata, it would be helpful to highlight any 
exceptions or areas that require the user’s immediate attention.

Data visualization 4

finance charts. To see the original dashboard, visit http://blog.mgm-tp.

Black background
Same colors for 
different pie charts
Figure 13-4: Sales dashboard.
Things that work well:
Unfortunately, we can’t find much in this data viz that works very well.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Color choice: Black backgrounds are tricky. Many newbies use a large 
dark background to make the charts stand out. Over time, however, 
most users get tired of the dark background, and if they have to print the 
data visualization, this background is surely a great waste of ink. Avoid 
using black or very dark backgrounds throughout a data viz unless you 
can overlay each section with a much lighter color. If you look back at 
Figure 13-2, you can see that the black background worked on that data 
viz because it was broken up by large amounts of white space.
	
✓	Chart choice: The Status pie chart on the left has four almost-equal 
slices and tells the user absolutely nothing. (Chapter 4 explains why pie 
charts can be a problem.) Using an ascending bar chart would make the 
small change in the values more evident.

181
	
✓	Chart choice: The Line of Business bar charts are tiny and hard to read. 
Moving the Line of Business column charts to where the line charts are 
currently located and increasing the height would allow more of the 
values to be shown. Presently it looks like it just got stuck in the corner.

Filtering menu
No labels on axes
Figure 13-5: Retail dashboard.
Things that work well:
	
✓	White space: The use of white space separates the graphical areas and 
the text.
	
✓	Text labels: Each section is well labeled, making it easy for users to 
understand what they’re looking at. In addition, the boxes around sec­
tions help users see each section as a discrete entity.
	
✓	Menu: The filtering menu is vertical and provides an array of options 
that allow users to drill down into the data.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Chart choice: The choices of charts for Top Products Per Category and 
Profit over Time are questionable. In addition, on the Profit over Time 
chart the axes are not labeled.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
	
	Instead of showing Top Products Per Category as bubbles of varying sizes, 
a pie chart showing the top five slices, with the remaining products 
grouped in an Other category, might work better. The Profit over Time 
chart could be represented with a simple line chart with some form of 
legend to help determine what the time frame is. The lack of labels on the 
axes of this chart limits its value. The users can’t tell what the time period 
is or what the spread of profit is from the lowest point to the highest.
	
✓	Menu filters: Having the pull-down menus on the right side instead of 
the left side isn’t consistent with what users expect. (See Chapter 6 for 
more information on the patterns in which humans digest information.)
	
	You should never reinvent the wheel with the design of your data viz. 
The filtering menu should be on the left side of the page, where the user 
will look first.
	
✓	Color choice: There’s no coordination of colors in this dashboard, 
and the color choices lack clarity. It appears that random colors were 
selected, which detracts from the overall visualization. It’s very difficult 
to determine what’s important or where to look first.
	
	A better solution would be to use RAG colors (red, amber, green) to 
show trends and to use muted colors for the rest of the information. See 
information about RAG colors in Chapter 10.
Data visualization 6
Figure 13-6 shows a data visualization created for policy information in the 
insurance industry. See the original image here: http://users.
infragistics.com/tsnyder/Pomegranate_Dashboard.PNG.
Things that work well:
	
✓	Color choice: The blue, green, and yellow color scheme is well executed. 
It’s very easy to follow the three categories in the chart legend through­
out the data viz. In addition, the white background on the left and the 
light blue background on the right separate the two areas nicely.
	
✓	Layout: The layout is easy to digest and doesn’t crowd any of the 
information. Note that a subtle line divides each of the areas.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Tables: The Pending Quote table needs more context to explain whether 
the quotes shown are the top five pending quotes or just the ones for 
that month. Their importance is vague.
	
✓	Chart choice: The stacked bar chart that shows New Policy Per Year by 
type is clear, although we question the value of showing the data this 
way. It would be more efficient to show the data in columns so that you 
can instantly see the different heights.

183
Column bars would be a better
choice than stackable bars. 
Figure 13-6: Policy information.
	
	The change from year to year seems to be so small that it might make 
more sense to add some context and perhaps also display the variance 
from year to year.
	
	In addition, the Active Policy by Type 3-D doughnut chart is unneces­
sary and ineffective. Although we often see these types of fussy charts, 
it would be more effective to use a simple pie chart.
	
✓	What-if scenario: It’s not apparent how to use the slider in the Active 
Policy by Type section. A simple label that explains would be quite 
helpful. Also, making the 3-D doughnut chart interactive is fun the first 
few times, but it distracts from the meaning of the data over the long 
term.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Size of slices hard to determine in 
3D pie chart
Figure 13-7: Cluttered data visualization.
Things that work well:
	
✓	Chart choice: The bubble chart at the top clearly shows the demo­
graphic progression of the membership and is a great use of a bubble 
chart.
	
✓	Sections: Using three clear sections makes it easy for users to view the 
visualizations.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Chart choice: This visualization shows how 3-D pie charts can get out 
of control. Showing 2012 Membership Stats in a 3-D horizontal pie chart 
is not only ineffective but also severely dilutes the message of the data 
because it’s hard to tell what the size of the actual slices are.
	
	Because the sizes aren’t very different, an ascending bar chart would 
work better so that you can more easily see the difference.
	
✓	Color consistency: All the charts use the same colors, but those colors 
have different meanings.
	
	As we state in Chapter 10, you need to use consistent colors to convey 
meaning. In this case, it would have been better to use a gradient of soft 
colors for the bottom charts to avoid having to reuse so many colors in 
different ways across each chart. The effect is quite confusing.

Icons
Personalization
Figure 13-8: City Smart Meter.
Things that work well:
	
✓	Personalization: Some people may argue that adding a friendly human 
face is a waste of space. In this case, the photo makes the data viz very 
inviting and provides information for users.
	
✓	Icons: The icons that show different divisions or categories are very 
effective. The icons not only save space but also bring to life the dif­
ferent types of buildings at which the power company checks meters. 
The same goes for the lightning icon in the Overall Voltage chart at the 
bottom. Again, although some people may argue that humanizing a data 
viz is a waste of space, it’s a good thing if it’s done correctly.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Color choice: The dark red, yellow, and green used in the thermometers 
and the values are overkill. Restricting these colors to the thermom­
eters would have been effective enough. When everything has an alert 
of some kind, nothing stands out. We also question whether using green 
adds any value. Sticking to a light gray would allow more focus on the 
red and yellow values.
	
✓	Chart choice: Thermometer bonanza! The data viz has too many ther­
mometers; as a result, their effects are diluted.

Things that work well:
	
✓	Chart choice: The bullet charts on the left tell a clear story about how

✓	Location intelligence: The use of proportionally sized, brightly colored 
circles on each country makes this display fairly easy to digest.

✓	Mobile viewing: A great feature of this data viz is that it shows you how 
it will look on mobile devices. You can see a consistent layout in the two 
versions.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Color choice: The striped background colors are distracting. The spec­
trum of colors attracts users’ attention, but in the wrong direction —
away from the data. A solid background would be better.
	
✓	Chart choice: The four micro line charts on the left, which show some 
sort of trend, add no value. Can you tell how Sales Last Year is trending 
by looking at the lines? Removing the lines and just displaying the num­
bers in large text would be much more effective. Also, the map uses a 
large amount of real estate compared to the value it adds.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Things that work well:
	
✓	Location intelligence: The chart in this data viz is clear and narrows 
down a specific region. The interactive nature of this map is great for 
users.
	
✓	Color choice: The colors in the map and chart on the left have the same 
meaning as the colors in map and chart on the right, making it easy for 
users to relate the data.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Interactivity: When it comes to maps, a user’s first reaction typically is 
to click the map to see location-specific information (and to simply see 
if it works). The designer missed an opportunity to provide more insight 
by not providing any interactivity.
	
✓	Duplication: Because the two visualizations are identical, using a simple 
filter to show the data on the right in the same display as on the left 
would enable users to gain more value.

Things that work well:
	
✓	Personalization: Although some people may consider the huge sailboat 
in the middle to be over the top and a bad use of real estate, the image 
on this executive dashboard — which was made to display on large 
screens and also to be used daily by executives — helps personalize the 
data viz. Other touches that make this data viz specific to this company 
are the deep blue colors and the stock ticker component. This visualiza­
tion really drives home data that is on the pulse of the company’s most 
important financial figures.
	
✓	Layout: The layout is fairly easy to digest. The charts are big and visible, 
and the numbers in the bottom bar are easy to read.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Noisy background: This particular background is a bit noisy for our 
taste. The light blues swooshing across the back can distract from some 
of the charts and data in that area. A darker or solid color background 
would be more efficient and compete less with the charts.
	
✓	Animation: When this data viz is in action, the picture of the sailboat 
automatically changes every 10 seconds to scroll through five different 
images. Although this may be great for the big screens in the office, it’s 
not so great for everyday use and consumption on a desktop or mobile 
device. A bit less animation would help to keep the user focused on 
the data.
	
	There always has to be a good balance between design and functional­
ity. Analysis Factory surely pushed the pendulum with the flashy nature 
of this data viz, and the users loved it. It’s good to remember that your 
users will get attached to data visualizations that feel personalized. This 
data viz does that, even though we question how much real estate is 
consumed by the sailboat pictures. Ultimately, what’s important is that 
the users are happy with the data viz, which was the case for this 
particular data viz.

BI Dashboard Formula team for a large food and beverage company. This 
visualization is the basis of our main example in Chapters 7 through 11.
Things that work well:
	
✓	Color choice: The muted gray color allows the alert colors to stand out.
	
✓	Layout: The layout is easy to digest as it uses a variety of circles and 
squares to highlight critical information. In addition, the sections are 
clearly labeled.

Tabular data should be 
replaced with visuals.
Figure 13-12: Food and beverage company sales dashboard.
	
	Even when you try your best to stick to the guidelines we provide in this 
book, there are always compromises that you have to make with the 
business users. In the example of Figure 13-12, one of the major compro­
mises we had to make was to include some reporting data and formatting 
to help the customer adapt to the experience of using visualizations. 
Previously, this customer had used too many reports and Excel sheets. 
The list of things that don’t work reflects some of the compromises we 
had to make on the design with those users and what we hope to see 
them change as their environment matures.
Things that don’t work:
	
✓	Tables: The entire bottom half looks like a big report, although we tried 
to give it a scorecard feel. In an ideal world, we would find a way to visu­
alize the most important parts of this data instead of presenting it in 
tables. Also notice that we included horizontal thermometer-style charts 
to try to incorporate a visual aspect.
	
	One way to improve Section b (which should be the Trends) would be to 
highlight the top three to five outliers in a more visual format. This 
could be done by using text mixed with some labeling and icons in place 
of the running, row-by-row format we currently have.

Recognizing Newbie Pitfalls
In This Chapter
▶	Contracting data overload syndrome
▶	Forgetting about mobile
▶	Using confusing alert colors
▶	Avoiding statistics
A

fter training so many data viz newbies globally, we have concluded 
that the first encounter most of our students have with any type of 
data visualization is with Microsoft Excel. Excel remains the number-one 
business intelligence (BI) tool in the world from a market-share standpoint. 
Unfortunately, its flexibility often allows users to hoard tons of raw data to 
devise a single answer, and the problem becomes overly complex.
Data visualization is usually treated as an afterthought; it 
doesn’t come into play until data has grown beyond the 
point where it can be reasonably distilled from spread­
sheets and reports. Only then do people seek to 
understand how data visualizations can help them 
communicate their message 
effectively.
The transition from a pure reporting tool like Excel 
to a more advanced software visualization tool is 
where new users succumb to common pitfalls. In 
this chapter we look at pitfalls that relate to how the 
data is used and designed.
Bear the topics in this chapter in mind as you build your 
visualizations. As you’ll discover, it’s very easy to fall into 
one of these traps.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Going Overboard with Data
The temptation to keep adding data to any visualization is almost impossible 
to resist. Data overload is not only hands down the most common pitfall but 
also one of the hardest habits to break.
Most data visualization newbies fall into one of two categories:
	
✓	Business analysts/super users (aka Excel addicts): These folks love 
using Excel, but they usually create a monster Excel application that has 
reached its limit. As a result, they’ve been asked to simplify the applica­
tion to include visuals that users can easily digest.
	
✓	Report or data developers: These people tend to have a deep reporting 
background, using tools way more advanced than Excel. When confronted 
with Big Data, they find that they need to simplify their message. Their 
users complain about the complexity of their reporting applications. 
In a desperate attempt to simplify, they stumble upon data visualization 
as the solution. They try to find ways to effectively apply visuals to their 
complicated systems to make them easier to digest.
If Big Data has become unmanageable, the use of visuals will help deliver true 
insight into the data. No set of Excel spreadsheets or reports can hold or ana­
lyze a gigabyte of data.
	
Like any addiction, data hoarding is hard to overcome. The first step in over­
coming it is admitting that you have a problem. You can change your ways. If 
you haven’t yet fallen into this trap, be extra-cautious going forward.
Figure 14-1 shows a first data visualization by someone who falls into one 
of the two preceding categories. The figure resembles a report with a few 
charts. Imagine trying to view a gigabyte’s worth of data in this format!

 Chapter 14: Recognizing Newbie Pitfalls
What can you do to stop yourself from getting sucked into the habit of adding 
more and more data? Here are two things to consider when you find yourself 
in this predicament:
	
✓	Make sure that you spend the necessary time completing the business 
intelligence (BI) blueprint. You need to work with the users to narrow 
down and focus on the key performance indicators and metrics that 
need to be tracked.
	
✓	Create a clear message for all four sections of the blueprint. When 
you have a clear idea of what story the data viz is going to tell, it’s 
much easier to determine what combination of visuals you need to 
use to communicate the message effectively.
	
See Chapter 7 for details on developing your BI blueprint.
	
Don’t be surprised if your users continually request a ton of unnecessary 
data and even rebel against displaying simplified visuals. We call this phe­
nomenon an emotional loss of data. Users won’t trust the visualization unless 
you present all the data for them to analyze. Curing this type of data overload 
usually requires a paradigm shift and retraining about how knowledge is to 
be shared across an organization.
Falling into the One-Shoe-Fits-All Trap
If you try to build a data visualization for everybody, absolutely nobody will 
use it. We call this situation the One-Shoe-Fits-All Trap.
	
As a data visualization newbie, your focus should be on building intelligent 
data visualizations with actionable data. The data visualization should have a 
clear story that the audience can identify. Therefore, focusing on audiences 
with similar needs is important.
You may be tempted to cram everything into a single data visualization for 
several reasons, such as a low budget, user pressure, or corporate politics. 
Succumbing to any of these reasons is a lose–lose situation for all parties 
involved. If you’re in Finance, viewing Human Resources (HR) data is of no 
value to you, and the same applies to the HR person who now has to view 
Financial data. This examples illustrates why choosing related audiences is 
so important.
One exception to this rule occurs when you’re building visualizations for a 
C-level audience — such as a CEO, the CEO’s direct staff, or a board of 
directors. Those people need to see a summarized view of all the divisions 
in an organization on a daily basis. In this case, it’s normal to have separate 
areas or tabs for Sales, HR, Finance, Information Technology, and so on.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
To duck this trap, be sure to follow the storyboard model prescribed in 
Chapter 7. It ensures that you always tell a story that’s unique to your audi­
ence, which is the key to long-term user adoption. If you don’t craft your 
story for your specific audience, your users will resent you and your product 
for wasting their time with information that’s irrelevant to them.
Focusing on the Tool Instead of the Story
You may notice that in several chapters of this book, we emphasize that 
you do not build a data visualization based on the functionality of a spe­
cific tool. When the tool is more important to you than the story, you find 
yourself saying “No” or “I can’t” too often, and you also find your users and 
future projects disappearing. For in-depth information about choosing a 
tool, see Chapter 3.
	
Business users have zero interest in what you can’t do. The key to success is 
focusing on their needs and then deciding, based on your own research, 
which tool is the best fit. You have many tools to choose among, and new 
tools are always entering this growing market. Finding the right tool may not 
be as hard as you think.
If you’re looking for suggestions, just do an Internet search for business intel­
ligence data visualization tools, and you’ll find an expansive list of tools to try.
	
If you can’t build a data viz because you can’t do it with a particular tool, the 
business user will pay someone else to do it — or attempt to do it himself. 
Don’t let this happen to you.
Users won’t wait for approval
In the past, if you were in an enterprise environ-
ment, your technology (IT) department probably 
wanted to approve any new tools to be used. 
Many organizations required you to go through 
months of compliance investigations before 
you could adopt any new technology — even 
a cheap one.
But gone are the days when users patiently 
waited for their IT departments to perform time-
consuming investigations of organizational 
compliance before adopting a new technology. 
The fast pace of the business world, combined 
with the accessibility of mobile devices, has left 
this archaic practice in the dust. The last thing 
you want to do is lose your users as they wait 
for a tool to be chosen.
As you gather requirements, make sure that you 
are simultaneously working on choosing the 
right tool in the background, away from your 
users. They’ll thank you for being open-minded 
and delivering the best possible tool to meet 
their needs.

Building Mobile Last
Let’s face it: If you’re not thinking mobile, you’re probably in the wrong indus­
try. Smartphones and tablets have forever changed the way that humans 
expect to interact with applications. The iTunes and Google Play stores are 
full of shiny, well-designed, interactive apps. They cause users to want all 
data visualizations to be accessible via mobile devices and to look and feel 
like apps.
Figure 14-2 shows a complex data viz that would be very hard to navigate on 
a mobile device because of the amount of information and the numerous drill-
down menus. (You can find this visualization at www.dashboardinsight.
com/CMS/627c6149-6dfd-432c-9b12-d6b6aa578084/Screen%20

shows a simplified but easy-to-digest and clear data viz that was built with 
mobile devices in mind. Notice the great use of white space, text, and loca­
tion intelligence. (You can see this image at http://data-ink.com/

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
You need to have a mobile-first mindset when you’re developing a data 
visualization. You should do several things:
	
✓	Make it intuitive. One thing that we all love about apps is that we don’t 
have to read a manual before using them. Be sure to carry this same 
experience over to your data visualizations on mobile devices. By using 
visual cues and clever treatments of colors, fonts, and textures, you 
make your data visualization easy to digest on a desktop computer or a 
mobile device.
	
✓	Account for reduced design space. The average mobile device today is 
3 to 10 inches (length and width), which represents a loss of almost half 
the screen real estate available on desktops. To work on mobile devices, 
your data visualization must take reduced screen size into consideration 
with regard to fonts, menus, and overall display. Smaller devices force 
you to develop concise data visualizations that convey your points 
quickly and clearly.
	
✓	Use native mobile functionality. Have you ever noticed that when you 
open an app on a mobile device and tap a menu, the specific menu for 
that device pops up? Be sure that all the menu options that you use in 
your data visualizations — be they drop-down menus or combo boxes — 
are compatible with all the mobile devices that your users may have. 
The last thing you want is for a user to get frustrated trying to use a 
data viz that doesn’t work well on his device.

197
 Chapter 14: Recognizing Newbie Pitfalls
	
✓	Enable sharing and social collaboration. Social collaboration is the 
name of the game in the 21st century. Your users expect to have an easy 
and intuitive way to share their data visualization findings with others. 
Be sure to make this capability native and not an afterthought.
	
✓	Make data quality a priority. When your users can access your data 
visualizations at any time, from any place, it’s important to ensure that 
your data visualization always outputs quality data. There’s a high 
chance that if the system is outputting garbage data, one of your users 
will detect that problem before you do.
	
✓	Be flexible. Part of the appeal of mobile apps is their interactivity, clean 
design, and capability to adapt quickly to new requirements. It is impor­
tant that you develop or choose a mobile tool for your visualization that 
you can easily adapt to your users’ needs.
	
✓	Plan for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). As policing the use of devices 
becomes a daunting task for IT, many companies are resorting to allow­
ing their users to use their own devices in the workplace. When you’re 
planning a data visualization, plan so that the data viz will work on the 
most common devices on the market: iOS devices, Android devices, and 
BlackBerry.
Abusing Pie Charts
There is a lot of controversy in the data-viz world about the efficacy of pie 
charts. Seasoned data-viz designers often look down on pie charts and 
believe that there are more effective ways to show the kind of data that is 
often displayed in a pie chart.
New data-viz designers love pie charts because they are simple to execute 
and easy to understand. However, you should never select a chart or graph 
type only because you are familiar with it. You need to make sure that you are 
choosing the best chart for the job. Be aware of the pie-chart trap.
Using Green for Alerts
A highly debated topic in the data visualization world is the use of green for 
alerts in Big Data visualizations. Most alerts, however, track negative events. 
As in the traffic-light scenario, red, yellow, and green are often used to signify 
the status of a specific event. Table 14-1 lists the most common RAG colors.

Table 14-1	
Alert Colors
Color
Use
Red
Indicates a serious problem that requires action
Yellow

Green
Provides information but doesn’t require user action
	
Chapter 7 covers how to use the business intelligence (BI) blueprint to gather 
user data requirements. As part of that process, you ask the user to define 
the thresholds at which a metric should display an alert.
The general consensus is that red alerts are very effective at capturing read­
ers’ attention and that green alerts are a waste of space.
Figure 14-4 shows a visual dashboard that uses both red and green alerts. 
Notice how difficult it is to focus on the red alerts, which are overshadowed by 
the green areas. You can find the original image at http://support.

 Chapter 14: Recognizing Newbie Pitfalls
	
Constantly displaying green alerts dilutes the message that urgent action is 
needed for a metric; it also makes it hard for the reader to distinguish 
between what’s good and what’s bad without deeper analysis.
	
Use only red or yellow for alerts, and display everything else in a neutral 
color such as gray so that the alerts stand out at a glance.
Figure 14-5 shows a good example of how to include a High Risk button that 
shows the red alerts on the BI dashboard when the user clicks it. This makes 
it easy to focus the reader’s attention on the events that require immediate 
action.
Click to see all  red alerts
	
We call green alerts in data visualizations happy because they give users a 
false sense of peace even when the most important measurements are red.
	
Many users insist on displaying green alerts because they believe that a Big 
Data visualization that displays only red is depressing, negative, or unhappy. 
Try to make it clear that your goal is to make the data as easy to digest as 
possible. You want to display only actionable data to reduce the time it takes 
users to focus their attention.

view only red alerts.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Ignoring Basic Statistics
We realize that the word statistics may evoke fear in some newbies, but we 
can’t ignore this topic, lest we overlook one of the most powerful ways to 
gain true insight and value from Big Data.
Statistics is the practice or science of collecting numerical data in large 
quantities. We’re not recommending that you go out and become a data sci­
entist (a term used for statisticians who are also data geeks in disguise and 
who usually hold some type of advanced degree, such as a PhD). You may 
want to consider picking up a Statistics 101 book or class, however, if you 
have any interest.
Statistical formulas such as probability, variance, and forecast are popular 
today. They’re fairly easy to apply to any data set, and most readers will 
clearly understand them. You can incorporate some of these statistical 
formulas into your Big Data visualizations to provide true value to users by 
using the techniques discussed in the following sections.
Knowing the probability that an event will occur
One statistical formula that you may be familiar with is probability — the like­
lihood or chance that an event may occur. The following formula calculates 
basic probability for a linear scenario. (Nonlinear scenarios are a bit complex 
and too much of an undertaking for a newbie.)
Probability = Probability an Event Will Occur / Number of Possible 
Outcomes
	
On a storyboard (refer to Chapter 7), a perfect place to insert the probability 
is Section 1: Current State. The idea is to give users a quick overview showing 
whether they’re likely to hit their goal.
Figure 14-6 shows a probability with some alert colors added to make the 
message easy to read and, most important, to clearly indicate that immediate 
action is needed.

 Chapter 14: Recognizing Newbie Pitfalls
	
Probabilities provide a quick reality check and set the overall tone for the 
story the data visualization will be providing during a given period (day, 
week, quarter, and so on).
Applying variance to show the magnitude 
of change
Another popular statistical measure is variance, which is the difference 
between a set of data points.
The most commonly used formula for calculating variance is
Variance = Final Desired – Current State
Whether the output displayed is a whole number or percentage, the formula 
shows the magnitude of change between the beginning state and the ending 
state of a data point.
Displaying the variance is always a quick win and a great substitute for the 
line/bar chart combo, which is how the variance relationship is displayed in 
most visualizations. Compare Figure 14-7 and Figure 14-8 to see how much 
more effective a visualization can be with a plotted variance.
The chart in Figure 14-7 shows a line/bar chart combo that lets the user deci­
pher the variance for each month. The original image is at http://
peltiertech.com/images/2009-11/BarLine_ColumnLine.png.

The second chart, shown in Figure 14-8, clearly plots the variance and 
takes all the guesswork out of the visual. You can find the original image 
at http://ksrowell.com/blog-visualizing-data/2013/02/14/
how-to-make-a-deviation-graph.
Forecasting the future
Yet another popular statistical formula that you may be familiar with is the 
forecast, which is the act of predicting or estimating an event or trend. For 
more details about forecasts, see Chapter 7.
When you calculate a forecast, you’re really using a certain amount of his­
toric data to predict behavior, a specific event, or a trend. For example, you 
could calculate the sales for the year based on the historic fact that January, 
usually accounts for 5 percent of the sales. If you made $500 in sales in 
January, you would use the following formula to forecast how much sales 
you can anticipate for the year:
$500 / .05 = $10,000
In this equation, $500 is the sales in January; .05 is the historic percentage 
of sales that January accounts for; and $10,000 is the projected sales for 
the year.

Figure 14-9 shows how forecasts are displayed in most data visualizations 
as a simple line in a chart. (This image is from www.exactsoftware.
com/docs/DocBinBlob.aspx?ID=%7B67d0ec85-71ae-4188-9646-
13831136cc53%7D.) Forecasts indicate how a given activity may perform in 
the future.
Displayed as a simple line on a chart
Changing the future with predictive analysis
Forecasts have been used for decades. With 
the introduction of Big Data, however, the field 
of predictive analysis is being invigorated. In 
predictive analysis, you take the data you have 
and make authoritative decisions about what 
the data means and how it can be applied to 
improve something.
Most organizations are finally realizing that 
the best ways to use Big Data are to react to 
events and to prevent them. For example, if you 
get data about the failure rate from an assembly 
line part, you can use that to predict when to 
change that part instead of waiting for it to fail. 
You become proactive instead of reactive.
The insights generated by predictive analysis 
often produce return on investment data that 
you can provide to your organization. Think of 
using predictive data as providing an option to 
change the future.

cash flow will eventually become an issue for this organization.

Part IV: Putting Data Viz Techniques into Practice 
Not Mastering User Engagement
If you build a data visualization, but it doesn’t engage the interest of your 
audience, all your work is for naught. User engagement throughout the devel­
opment process is the key to success.
Problems with user engagement usually take one of these forms:
	
✓	No user engagement: Lack of user engagement is the most common 
scenario. Data visualization developers go off into a dark corner to 
gather requirements and create; then they pop up later with something 
that the user is unhappy with. We call this situation the “nuclear bomb.” 
The data viz is built delicately and secretly, but when it’s finally 
presented, the effect is like a destructive explosion.
	
✓	Too much user engagement: The other extreme is too much user 
engagement — particularly when you lose control of the conversation 
and get a never-ending list of change requests from your users.
To avoid both of these problems, follow the steps in Chapters 7 and 8 for 
developing your story, creating your first storyboard, and creating your 
mockup.
Some other key elements may help you strike the right balance with your 
users. When you have the appropriate amount of user engagement, you can 
gain your users’ trust, maintain it, and deliver a big data visualization that 
exceeds their expectations.
Table 14-2 lists some ways to engage users. These techniques go a long way 
toward building trust and credibility.

Top Ten Fears of New 
Data-Viz Creators
W

e know that you’re very interested in finding out how to create great 
data visualizations. If you weren’t, you wouldn’t be reading this book. 
But admit it: You’re also a bit scared. There’s no shame in that. As newbies, 
we were a bit overwhelmed when we created our first data visualizations. 
Tackling something new is always unsettling. Often, a lot is riding on 
producing a data viz that people find useful.
So how can you conquer these fears? The best way is to face them, and we 
want to help. This chapter looks at the top ten fears you may have as you 
start your first data viz.
We’ve worked with data viz clients for several years, and the same fears 
come up time and time again. We hope this list will show you that 
you’re on the right track and among friends. Just jump in and 
get started — after reading this chapter.
Telling the Wrong Story
You’ve heard that data viz is about storytelling. 
Good data visualizations tell important stories that 
generate fabulous insights, right? But as you start 
developing your data viz, you have no idea what 
story you’re going to tell. You can’t know what the 
story is until you get everything assembled and put 
in place. So fear rears its ugly head. You wonder, “What 
if I don’t have a story to tell? What if it’s not inspiring and 
compelling?”
First things first. You can’t tell your story until you know what the 
data says, and you can’t know what the data says until you figure out what 
data you will use. You need to start at the beginning and put all the elements

Part V: The Part of Tens 
together. Your first step is to figure out what questions you want to answer. 
For ­step-by-step guidelines, see Chapter 4. When you have all your prepara­
tion done, you’ll feel less overwhelmed and ready to make story choices.
Creating an Ugly Data Viz
One major reason why data visualizations have become so popular is that they 
look great online and make a big splash. Think about the ones you’ve seen that 
have really made an impression on you. Starting with the idea that you’ll create 
a great-looking data viz too, however, only amplifies the anxiety you feel.
Ugly data visualizations are just as useless as beautiful ones that have no 
meaning. It’s true that people will judge the quality of your data viz by its 
design. As visual beings, we respond to images. If a data viz has no real value 
apart from being eye candy, users won’t continue to use it. For this reason, your 
first goal is to answer the questions you and your stakeholders have about the 
data. After you’ve done that, you can concern yourself with the visual aspects.
Picking the Wrong Things to Measure
You may think that if you choose to include the company’s current key 
performance indicators (KPIs) in the data viz, you can’t go too far wrong. 
That’s partially true, but there’s much more to it than that, and that’s 
what concerns you. You know that the KPIs will include some of the right 
data, but what about all the other measures that your department cares 
about? And if your department (or the client) doesn’t have KPIs, how 
should you proceed?
One way is to begin by understanding what the data viz will accomplish. 
Will it answer questions about how the sales force is performing? Will it try 
to show which territories are generating the most revenue? After you decide 
what the purpose of your data viz will be, try to agree on a title for it. That 
title likely won’t be the final one. Lots of things can happen during the proj­
ect’s duration to change it. But at least you can see whether everyone is in 
agreement at the beginning about where you’re headed. After you’ve picked 
the title, ask everyone to agree on the measures that should be used to fulfill 
the promise of the title. If you get a dialogue started, you are moving forward 
in an intelligent way.

 Chapter 16: Top Ten Fears of New Data-Viz Creators 
Alienating Other Stakeholders
You may be alienating other data viz stakeholders by speaking your mind. 
How can this be? You want to do your best for your collaborators and your 
company, but you find that you just don’t agree with their ideas about 
the data viz. You wonder whether you should speak up and risk their 
­disapproval. The answer probably is yes.
Voicing your ideas about how to proceed can make your data viz stronger. 
It’s also important to hear what your colleagues have to say. You want to 
be aware if someone has a vested interest in a particular outcome. If you 
­determine that someone does have a bias, you should speak to them about 
how it might affect the outcome. On the other hand, someone may have a 
different viewpoint that’s worth considering. Either way, don’t be afraid to 
speak your mind, and encourage others to do the same. You can be sure 
that your managers will voice their opinions when the data viz is presented 
to them. Then you’ll wish that you’d considered all the angles; otherwise, 
you may appear to be unprepared to answer questions and may fail to 
demonstrate that you understand the data.
Misunderstanding the Audience 
for Your Data Viz
You may think that you know the audience for your data viz. If you have an 
internal audience, you believe that you know what the users want. You do 
your homework and speak to all the major stakeholders. You want to have a 
clear vision of users’ expectations and work to understand how they intend 
to use the data viz.
If you have an external audience, you do your best to research who your 
users are and what they need. But you still have a nagging feeling that you 
haven’t connected with all the groups who will use your data viz. This fear 
isn’t unfounded. It’s possible that you can miss speaking to someone who will 
use your data viz. You can rectify this problem by asking all your major stake­
holders to use the data visualization for several days as a pretest. A data viz 
isn’t set in stone; you can modify it. By pretesting, you can gain confidence 
that you have hit your target.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Forgetting about Copyrights and 
Legal Matters
When you set out to create a data viz, it’s unlikely that your first thought 
is about legal considerations. Your focus probably is on taking massive 
amounts of data and turning it into useful information. (Your corporate 
lawyers would be disappointed if they knew that.) When you’ve completed 
the task of creating your data viz, however, your thoughts do turn to the legal 
aspects, and you may feel intimidated.
	
If you know a few simple rules, you can feel more confident that you’re taking 
the right actions to protect your company:
	
✓	Put a copyright date and your company’s name at the bottom of the 
data viz. You may think that this is unnecessary for an internal audience, 
but just in case the data viz finds its way outside the company, you should 
put in the copyright.
	
✓	Set out the terms and conditions that users of the data viz must 
adhere to. If you’re unsure what’s required, ask your manager. You can 
find more detail about copyrights, terms, and conditions in Chapter 11.
Selecting the Wrong Tool
If you’re a newbie, one of the following descriptions probably applies to you:
	
✓	You aren’t sure what tool to use, and your anxiety is sky-high.
	
✓	You’ve used a simple tool like Microsoft Excel in the past, and you want 
to step up your game and use something more powerful, but you aren’t 
sure what tool fits the bill.
	
✓	You’ve fallen in love with a specific data viz tool because you’ve seen 
others use it, but you have no experience with it.
In all these cases, you have valid concerns. They all involve learning some­
thing new. You wonder whether you’re up to the task. The answer is yes, but 
you need to know how to go about selecting the right tool. The good news is 
that there’s a rule of thumb. The key to picking the right tool is picking it 
last — after all the data preparation is done.
This idea may make you uncomfortable, because you want to know every­
thing you’re going to do before you begin a new data viz. But picking the right 
tool is akin to picking the right chart (see the next section): You need to know 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

217
 Chapter 16: Top Ten Fears of New Data-Viz Creators 
what data you want to display before selecting a chart type. Each tool has 
its own positives and negatives. You want to choose a tool that fits with your 
capabilities, goals, and data. For some ideas, see Chapter 3.
Making the Wrong Chart Choices
Choosing the right chart to display your data greatly influences the value of 
your completed data viz. Chapter 13 includes some examples of poor chart 
choices. From looking at these examples, you see that the use of the right 
chart can make or break a data viz.
To avoid making the wrong choice, it’s best to try a few options with live 
data. Sometimes, the only way to find out what works is to experiment.
	
To make choosing the right chart less baffling, presentation expert 
Dr. Andrew V. Abela, chairman of the School of Business and Economics 
at The Catholic University of America, created a “chart chooser” 
that you can use to help ­facilitate your choice. You can find it at 
http://­extremepresentation.­typepad.com/blog/2006/09/
choosing_a_good.html. It helps you match your situation with the 
right chart.
Picking Bad/Noncomplementary Colors
If you fear choosing the right colors for your data viz, you’re in good 
­company. This fear is ever-present in new data-viz creators. You’re likely 
to find selecting colors for your data viz daunting, because it’s no easy feat 
to pick the right colors. You can use online tools to help you make color 
choices, however. See Chapter 10 for details about those tools.
	
Some colors have a meaning, and you need to be aware of them. The RAG 
(red, amber, green) colors, for example, are the same colors used for traffic 
lights. Because most users are familiar with stoplights, they intuitively 
­recognize that red means “stop,” amber means “caution,” and green means 
“go.” When you use these colors in a data viz, your users apply what they 
already know about them to the information you’re presenting. Consequently, 
if you want to alert them to something that requires attention, make sure to 
use red, not purple or blue.
	
Also, some people are color-blind. For genetic reasons, they don’t see colors 
quite the same way that others do. For this reason, don’t get carried away 
with wild colors. Your best bet is to choose colors with which everyone is 
familiar. Leave the fancy stuff to the designers.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using Too Much Data
Feeling that you’re inundated with data can make you fearful that you’re 
­displaying too much data. You want to get to the heart of the matter and 
­eliminate extraneous data, but you don’t want to eliminate any data that 
could be valuable. So you wonder what data you should choose and how 
much of it you should include.
Displaying too much data in your data viz is definitely a concern. You want to 
start with the minimum amount of data and add more as necessary. Examples 
sprinkled throughout the book illustrate how messy things get when a visu­
alization has too much data. You want to show as much as you can so that 
users can gain serendipitous insights, but you have to make sure that you’re 
not obscuring the most important insights. Displaying too much data can 
cause confusion. If you have more data than you can use in one data viz, 
­perhaps it’s wise to create another data viz for that data.

Author’s Acknowledgments
It’s an honor to write about something that I’m so passionate about: data 
visualization. A big thank you to John Wiley & Sons, Inc. for providing me the 
opportunity to share my experiences with the world.
The following list of people I owe a sincere thanks for their influence, enthusi­
asm, and ability to make me think outside the box for this book.

Katie Mohr and Project Editor Charlotte Kughen — for working around 
my crazy schedule and helping me to pursue this dream.

Grygorcewicz from (SAP Power Networks), and John Boughflower (Royal

It is my great privilege to write a book on data visualization. I want to offer 
great thanks to John Wiley Publishing, Inc. for letting me present my ideas
