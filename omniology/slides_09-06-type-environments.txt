` false : Bool 
 
 
s is a string literal 
` s: String 
 
[False] 
[String]

new T produces an object of type T 
– Ignore SELF_TYPE for now . . . 
 
 
` new T : T 
 
[New]

` e:  Bool 
` !e : Bool 
 
 
` e1: Bool 
` e2:T 
` while e1 loop e2 pool:Object 
 
[Not] 
[Loop]

Type Environments 
• What is the type of a variable reference? 
 
x is a variable 
` x: ? 
 
• The local, structural rule does not carry enough 
information to give x a type. 
 
 
[Var]

• Put more information in the rules! 
 
• A type environment gives types for free variables 
– A type environment is a function from 
ObjectIdentifiers to Types 
– A variable is free in an expression if it is not 
defined within the expression

Let O be a function from ObjectIdentifiers to Types 
 
The sentence  O ` e: T 
 
is read: Under the assumption that variables have the 
types given by O, it is provable that the expression e 
has the type T

The type environment is added to the earlier rules: 
  
i is an integer literal 
O ` i : Int 
 
 
O ` e1: Int   O ` e2: Int   
O ` e1 + e2 : Int 
 
[Int] 
[Add]

And we can write new rules: 
 
O(x) = T 
` x: T 
 
 
 
 
[Var] 

Alex Aiken 
Type Environments 
 
 
O[T0/x] ` e1: T1 
O ` let x:T0 in e1 : T1 
 
 
 
 
[Let-No-Init] 

Type Environments 
O1 ` e1: T1 
O2 ` e2: T2 
O ` let x: T1 <- e1 in e2 : T2 
[Let-Init] 
Fill in the correct type environments in 
the following type rule 
O1 = O[T1/x]; O2 = O[T1/x] 
O1 = O[T1/x]; O2 = O[T2/x] 
O1 = O; O2 = O[T1/x] 
O1 = O; O2 = O[T2/x] 

Alex Aiken 
Type Environments 
• The type environment gives types to the free 
identifiers in the current scope 
 
• The type environment is passed down the AST from 
the root towards the leaves 
 
• Types are computed up the AST from the leaves 
towards the root
