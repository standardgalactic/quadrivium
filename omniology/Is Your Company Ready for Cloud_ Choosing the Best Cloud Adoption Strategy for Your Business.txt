Developing and Hosting 
Applications on the Cloud
By Alexander Amies, Harm Sluiman,
Qiang Guo Tong, and Guo Ning Liu
ISBN: 0-13-306684-3
The promise of cloud computing is that 
centralization, standardization, and automa-
tion will simplify user experience and reduce 
costs. However, achieving these beneﬁts 
requires a new mind set. Developing and 
Hosting Applications on the Cloud covers 
these aspects of application development and 
operation and provides practical guidance,
giving numerous code examples and demon-
strations of system utilities for deployment,
security, and maintenance.
This title makes special reference to the IBM 
SmartCloud Enterprise, but the principles 
explained are general and useful to anyone 
planning to automate management of IT 
infrastructure using the cloud. Developers us-
ing cloud management application program-
ming, architects planning projects, or others 
wanting to automate management of IT 
infrastructure will value this end to end story 
for why they would want to develop a cloud 
application, how to do it, and how to make it 
part of their business.

cost, including ITIL, IT ﬁ nancial management,
balanced scorecards, and business cases. You’ll

Acknowledgments
T
he book was written in acknowledgment of several passion points
of mine. The first is my clients: I find you interesting and I
thank you for being you. The second is strategy, which is what I focus on
to keep my clients satisfied. The third is cloud computing, which is an
exciting process enabler and business technology. And the fourth is
enterprise architecture (EA)—there is something about that holistic,
integrated approach to anticipating the need for change and solving
business problems that I find extremely valuable. I hope you find my
experiences insightful as you read this book. I thank God first and fore-
most for the ability, and for doing great things for me.
I thank my family for unwavering support. To my darling husband
and Vietnam veteran, Frank, well, first of all thank you for your service.
I love you and I appreciate you, your encouragement, and your amazing
faith. I am so glad you came home. And then came you, Frank, and then
came you.
I thank my baby girl, Talea. What an amazing and beautiful young
lady you are. I am so very proud of you, your intelligence, your stamina,
and your ability to remain genuine and true to your word. These com-
bined characteristics are and will continue to take you far so hold on to
them. And you know something else, Talea, thank you for keeping me
positive while I worked on this book and your insights on supercomput-
ers—only my girl can do that!
I am thankful for my baby brother, Sgt. McCoy; I am so glad that you
made it back from two wars. I know you don’t mind serving, but I hope
you stay home! To the rest of my family you are special, and you are
loved and you know it.
Claus, thank you for co-authoring Chapter 7—there certainly is a lot
to think about when it comes to planning the transition to cloud. Thank
you, Althea Hopkins, Robert Carter, and James Jamison, for reviewing
content; Omkhar Arasaratnam, I appreciate your insights when it comes
to both managing and mitigating risk (Chapter 6); Chris Molloy for
making the time as well as for your contributions to Appendix A; John
Caldwell, Tina Abdollah Martin Jowett, Rob High, Hector Hernandez,

Steve Stansel, Mary Beth Ray, Sham Vaidya, Faried Abrahams, Sugandh
Mehta, Sue Miller-Sylvia, and Ruthie Lyle; Emily Koenig, and the entire
corporate executive board for graphics that you shared to help enforce
some key messages; Mark Carlson from Oracle Corporation; Lydia
Duijvestijn and husband for your contributions to the financial chapter;
the late Mark Ernest for including me in the cloud adoption framework
development initiative at IBM; Jeffrey Caldwell from SonicWALL—
what a friend you are indeed; Elisabeth Stahl for your support and con-
tributions to the financial chapter; Susanne Glissman, for your
perspectives on component modeling and cloud, which landed in
Chapter 4; John Lamb, for your case study that is referenced repeatedly
and elaborated in Appendix B; I also appreciate Ms. Hayes-Angiono and
my students of 2011, Talia, Julissa, Kayla, Natalia, Jacque A.,
Jacquelyn V., Lizbeth, Vivian, and Esmeralda; yes, it is possible!
—Pamela Isom
I want to acknowledge my two sons for their spirit and love: To my
oldest son, Kier Holley, for his maturity, kindness, intellect, kindred
spirit, and paving a road that always reminds me that the future is
bright. As a freshman in high school, he is beginning to build his
future, and I am quite proud of him. Quiet in disposition, always think-
ing, he will be brilliant at whatever he decides to do in life.  I love him
dearly and watching him expand his horizons is pure pleasure. His love
of mathematics, science, and the arts is most excellent.
To my youngest son, Hugo Holley, for his old soul spirit, his sweet
soul, who torched the road ahead for me in writing, and makes my soul
shine whenever he says, “You are the best dad ever.” I love his critical
thinking and optimism. His love for his brother and mother warms my
heart. I love him with all my heart.  It is a pleasure to see him excel in
mathematics and science.
To my brother, Laurence Holley, for his support throughout my life,
and my late sister, Lynette Holley, whose love and support has always
created a steady path in my life. It is to her memory that I dedicate this
book.
Finally to Sue Duncan, founder of the Susan Duncan Children’s
Center, for creating a world I could live in as a child and making the
road I travel today possible.

W
hile numerous books in the market describe implementation
details of cloud computing, this book emphasizes the need for
a cloud adoption strategy offering guidance on cloud investment deci-
sion making as well as how to evolve your strategy so that it remains rel-
evant during changing business conditions.
We have had the pleasure of working with companies that are 
business-centric when it comes to cloud decision making as well as those
that are more technology-centric. The business-centric consumer tends
to focus on ensuring that cloud investments will strengthen the com-
pany’s presence in the marketplace; these companies are concerned with
establishing the right business portfolio that encompasses cloud and
understanding the buying behaviors of targeted consumers. The technol-
ogy-centric consumer on the other hand tends to lean on cloud services
to build up IT capability and improve business performance. In both
cases increasing profitability and agility are at the forefront of business
objectives.
When it comes to developing your cloud adoption strategy a mixed
business and technical strategy is significant, and that is why we wrote
this book—to share experiences and insights on how to integrate busi-
ness and information technology (IT) decision points as well as offer
holistic, companywide considerations in an effort to guide development
of an effective strategy that generates sustainable business outcomes!
Written from a cloud consumer’s point of view, this book offers cloud
service providers insight into how to motivate consumption of their
cloud services, while both consumers and providers will learn how to go
about developing an effective cloud adoption strategy tailored for their
business.

Business Influence and Cloud
Having 25 plus years of experience in IT, I have worked with a vast
array of executives, business leaders, and practitioners from small,
midrange, and large companies that face challenges of varying degrees. I
enjoy working with clients, and I really enjoy getting to know the teams
so that we solve business problems together and in such a way that iden-
tified changes are actionable and easier to embrace. Examples include
ensuring that adequate sourcing strategies are understood and put in
place within organizations, as well as ensuring that appropriate business
technologies are adopted for the right business reasons.
In general, most client business drivers fall into two main categories.
First, change to improve business performance. This may as an example
involve offering guidance on how to expand global business operations
or conduct process improvements. Second, improving efficiencies, which
often translates to reducing the costs of conducting business. This typi-
cally involves streamlining business as well as IT costs while maximiz-
ing service efficiencies. The magnitude of these drivers has bubbled up
and down over the years. For instance, both the dot-com and the 2007
economic experiences were prefaced with optimistic spending followed
by stringent cutbacks. Now considering the economic recovery, busi-
nesses are promoting cautious spending while investing in established
capital using strategies such as outsourcing, business partnering, and
there is a notable increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to
strengthen business portfolios.
In fact, the economic bubble (although unpleasant at times) attrib-
utes in many aspects to innovation. I mean think about it; business
today is conducted over the Internet using more cost-effective and effi-
cient capabilities such as AppStore services; the use of social collabora-
tion or “social-ware” is more profound in business decision making;
mobile technologies have been around but global growth and consump-
tion patterns continue to expand; and cloud computing—or “cloud” for
short—is becoming more prevalent for providing core, not just minor,
business competencies.

Cloud in Context
Most businesses have heard the term cloud and understand it to mean
a business service model that enables consumption and delivery of busi-
ness and IT services on a “pay for what you use” basis. This capability is
enabled through subscription or flat rate service charges, similar to the
rates you pay for mobile use or magazine subscriptions, and consump-
tion-based pricing or metered charges, which are more exact charges or
up to the minute. Purchasing services in the cloud allows you to invest
in assets that are off-premise as opposed to investing in-house. In gen-
eral, it is less expensive and more efficient to purchase cloud solutions
off-premise than it is to outright buy assets that you may or may not
use, or build the capability internally. Private clouds are different in that
you own the assets so there may be some up-front costs, but there are
tangible benefits due to ready-made solutions, economies of scale, and
again consumption-based pricing. That being said, you probably are not
surprised that the adoption of cloud makes for a compelling business
case. Many companies for instance are concerned that their IT staff has
been spread pretty thin over the past years and would benefit from
“ready-made” solutions that are available in the cloud. Cloud delivery
models, although necessary to understand, are not as interesting as
understanding the business innovation and opportunities presented with
the adoption of cloud computing.
Why the Strategic Emphasis?
I certainly agree with the benefits of cloud and support the use whole-
heartedly, but I also believe that you can get even more out of your cloud
investments if you strategically position and ready your company for
cloud. To me, and this may have to do with my upbringing in athletics,
strategy is your combined vision and playbook. You must have a vision,
one that others can imagine and embrace, and you have to execute the
right plays to attain your vision. In addition, you must evolve your
strategy to grow and remain competitive, especially considering that a
cloud adoption strategy today requires market analysis and agility to
remain effective tomorrow. To prepare for cloud adoption, you might
specifically require the immediate discipline of portfolio management
and governance at executive levels so that good decision making and
Preface
xxi

exception handling practices are carried forward into adoption decisions;
you may need to strategize business patterns for adoption that include
development of a diversified cloud portfolio or stronger business part-
nerships so that you contain business risk; you might choose to broaden
the marketing depth of your CTO so that you, as a company, are more
business savvy when it comes to ideation and propelling the use of cloud
across your value net; or quite frankly, you might decide to focus on
building internal assurances so that members of your highly regulated
vertical organization (e.g., healthcare) are trained on compliance proce-
dures and can apply these requirements to guide cloud adoption choices.
Whatever your situation, you need to sharpen your readiness for cloud
by developing a strategy that embraces change so that you effectively
perform now and in the future. In essence, it is not about the adoption;
it is how you strategically plan, grow, execute, and maintain the adop-
tion of cloud in your company. One thing is for certain, and you hear
this as you read: There is so much more to cloud than technology.
One way to ready your company for cloud is to incorporate cloud into
your enterprise architecture (EA)—your integrated business and IT
strategy. To provide some context, there are three dimensions of EA:
strategy (which is the focus of this book), management and control, and
execution. There are numerous ways to depict an EA, and essentially
there are four domains: business architecture, information systems archi-
tecture (which are applications and data), technology/infrastructure
architecture, and governance. Definitions of each domain are provided in
the glossary. As you contemplate your decision to adopt cloud, albeit
now or in the future, you should consider each domain and incorporate
cloud considerations for two primary reasons. First, the value of cloud
continues to generate a compelling business case for small and large
companies, and as such it is never too soon to begin preparations; and
second when you think about the domains it is important to understand
that each can be outsourced in its entirety or in part to cloud and there-
fore strategic consideration is prudent and will make your transition
that much smoother. Suppose you are interested in consuming SaaS
(Software-as-a-Service) collaboration services because you feel that devel-
oping applications internally is too costly and simply not worth the
investment at a given point in time. The question emerges: What are
some key business considerations for SaaS adoption in your company?
For example, are you prepared to intertwine your SaaS applications with
your current business processes and applications, and are others willing

and ready to embrace the required changes? The magnitude of adoption
of course depends on your business needs, and you learn as you read that
sometimes cloud is not the right fit or course corrections are needed to
sustain the adoption.
One of the central messages in this book is the need to create an
enterprise cloud adoption strategy; one that is reusable and positions
you to make sound choices. Figure P.1 illustrates the life cycle of an
enterprise cloud adoption strategy that commences with initial plan-
ning and concludes with implementation planning ensuring that there
is a smooth transition from strategy to project delivery. As you read, you
find the topics expounded throughout this book with expressed focus on
the cloud adoption life cycle in Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your
Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy.”

Yes, This Book Is Applicable to You
Is this book applicable to you if you are a small to mid-market com-
pany or perhaps if you do not have an EA? Yes. Consider the following
three points. First, the value and expectations of a cloud adoption strat-
egy are described as well as key considerations such augmenting your
delivery model with cloud that includes dealing with multisourced
environments, risk mitigation, financial considerations, and other
strategic imperatives such as roadmap development. All of these are
business criteria that must be considered to develop an effective strat-
egy, and such insights are significant for all business models irrespective
of the size of your company. Second, special considerations for the small
to mid-market company are incorporated into this book. Third, if you
have a business strategy and if you have an IT strategy, you have some
basic EA fundamentals and you will learn techniques for incorporating
cloud so that your organization reaps optimal benefits. So read on and

discover how you can ready your company for cloud, and learn how you
can enable yourself to make more effective, strategic cloud adoption
choices. Finally, if you are wondering how cloud computing can make
your business more nimble, differentiate your business, or open new
markets the content herein will be invaluable.
Introduction
If you are too tactical (implementation focused) in your cloud adop-
tion pursuits, you run the risk of adopting solutions that temporarily
add value with a rate of diminishing returns that is faster than you are
able to offset. If your approach is too strategic, you run the risk of devel-
oping a strategy that is too high level, one that is difficult to relate to
and might not get executed as you intended or your strategy becomes
shelfware. What then can you do to guide successful cloud adoption in
your company?
Understanding your business classification as well as your competen-
cies (as discussed in Chapter 4, “Identifying Cloud Candidates”) is one
example consideration that is critical to establishing a value-centric
cloud adoption strategy. Knowledge as to where you are as well as your
target state can influence cloud adoption decisions. Listed are some com-
mon consumer considerations:
1. Small-medium businesses (SMB) might be more interested in Storage-
as-a-Service and at a smaller capacity than larger enterprises.
2. Industry verticals, such as healthcare providers, might lean more toward
private or community clouds in an effort to meet regulatory stipulations.
3. Large enterprises are more likely to pay for cloud services on account as
opposed to credit card purchases.
4. Value added resellers (VAR) add value on top of cloud offerings in the
form of customized services. You need to understand the markup and
total costs to you as a consumer.
5. Cloud service brokers (CSB) are likely to partner with numerous vendors
to generate the best cloud solution for your company. In this book, the
expression CSB, systems integrator, and service integrator are used inter-
changeably and scenarios are elaborated throughout with descriptions in
the glossary.
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
xxiv

Consider the following business scenario for a mid-market cloud 
consumer:
The company decided to authorize designated purchases of cloud services using
corporate credit cards only. This mid-market company’s business requirement
therefore was that cloud service providers allow credit card purchases knowing
that it is more common for larger companies to purchase solutions using other
mechanisms such as purchase orders because of the larger quantities. A key busi-
ness discussion pertained to credit authorization and more important, billing
services. How consumers would be billed for services in a pay per use model,
would charges occur daily to credit cards or accrue on a monthly basis, and when
would payments get processed? What exactly does pay per use imply with respect
to service charges? Another key discussion was how services would be disabled if,
for example, usage exceeded an authorized credit limit. In this particular case,
the company negotiated the appropriate activation and deactivation of cloud serv-
ices with the provider with an eye for maintaining outstanding service levels.
You learn more about this case study in the epilogue; however, a key message for
you to consider is that as you go about planning adoption of cloud in your com-
pany, you need to establish enterprise business policies (e.g., purchasing standards
for cloud services) as well as establish a governance model that requires appropri-
ate parties to engage in the decision making process at appropriate times.
This book, Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?, is a first complete guide
to cloud decision making for executives and leaders in both business and
technical strategy roles. Using practical experiences with enterprise cus-
tomers, situational analogies, and vignette style business scenarios, this
book contains strategies for readying your organization for cloud adop-
tion and explores cloud business trends and consumption patterns.
Included are techniques for selecting cloud products and services, and
strategies for driving business value into organizations by planning your
adoption through the use and/or extension of enterprise architecture
(your integrated business and IT strategy).
This book is not an introduction to cloud computing or EA, but
rather illustrates the business value aspects of cloud, offering insights to
help you the consumer determine which cloud adoption strategy is the
most suitable for your business. If you do not have an EA, this book is
applicable as you learn some strategic principles that you can embrace to
guide decisions such as data center considerations, operating in multi-
sourced environments, intellectual property management, and how to
recognize and apply cloud business adoption patterns. Example topics
include identification and prioritization of cloud candidates and
Preface
xxv

enablers, techniques for developing an enterprise cloud adoption strat-
egy, business integration, and governance of your adoption for optimal
usage of cloud within your company. At times you find contrasts to
organizations with and without an EA and the respective cloud adoption
experiences.
Cloud-Sourcing and Traditional Sourcing Options
The expression cloud-sourcing is referenced throughout because there
are similarities as well as differences in approaches that you must con-
sider. For instance, from a transition planning perspective, if you are
accustomed to working with outsourcing vendors, you may be able to
leverage those same vendors as cloud providers, which could lead to
more favorable contracts along with a smoother transition due to inter-
nal acclimation to outsourced services albeit on-premise or off-premise.
At the same time, there are differences in cloud-sourcing that for
instance require more self-service in the areas of service selection as well
as problem ticketing with which you must become accustomed. In
essence, you have some advantages to cloud-sourcing if you currently
practice traditional sourcing strategies such as outsourcing and managed
operations, but there are challenges that you must consider as you pre-
pare your company for a successful cloud experience.

■Chapter 2, “Business Value of Incorporating Cloud into Your EA”:
What value is expected by incorporating cloud into your enterprise archi-
tecture? This chapter answers such questions and describes the impacts of
considering both business and technology to guide cloud adoption deci-
sions. You learn of key considerations for organizations that may not have
or practice the discipline of EA and the effectiveness when it comes to
cloud adoption.
■Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption
Strategy”: This chapter describes the life cycle of an enterprise cloud
adoption strategy. You review new additions and/or augmentations to
existing EA work artifacts as applicable from a consumer’s perspective.
You review examples and approaches for determining key considerations
that help you recognize and capture cloud-specific business requirements.
And you find specific considerations for organizations that have incorpo-
rated service oriented architecture (SOA) into their enterprise.
■Chapter 4, “Identifying Cloud Candidates”: How do you go about
deciding the contents of your cloud service portfolio? This chapter pro-
vides techniques for identifying cloud candidate components (including
components within larger outsourcing or managed services solutions) as
viable solution alternatives.

the outcomes of organizations where governance is strong as well as those
situations where governance is merely paperwork with no compliance.
This chapter provides practical considerations for enabling governance in
an enterprise where cloud is a part of the organizational landscape.
Because cloud solutions often involve outsourcing, this chapter also pro-
vides guidance for governing in the presence of outsourcing.
■Chapter 6, “Mitigating Risk”: Learn how to recognize and mitigate
cloud adoption risks, including information security breaches, cost over-
runs, and inadequate operational performance by making explicit mitiga-
tions, which are implicit with older alternatives to cloud such as IT

This page intentionally left blank 

Sharon is a cloud business consultant for a boutique consulting firm. In a con-
versation with a colleague, Paul, she expressed that one of her clients
(Distributors, Incorporated) was intrigued by the possibilities of cloud computing
and expressed interest in eliminating all in-house Information Technology (IT)
software and hardware capacity in exchange for cloud-sourcing. Paul found the
conversation intriguing because his experiences had been with clients using cloud
computing to address moving specific workloads, but never offloading all soft-
ware and hardware to the cloud. Paul did not think this approach was feasible.
His rationale was that although support, servers, and services can be offloaded,
some core networking and security solutions are required internally to support
cloud adoption. Sharon expressed that the CIO of Distributors’ survived the eco-
nomic downturn by effectively controlling expenditures and planned to continue
on this course as a major part of the business strategy to maintain profitability.
Sharon and Paul agreed that offloading IT capability to the cloud is a growing
reality, as industry analysts predict that by the year 2014, 20 percent of businesses
will shift the ownership of IT assets to third parties, causing a decrease in the total
1

amount of IT asset requirements.1 Sharon and Paul then asked themselves is this how
Distributors’ should be looking at cloud computing?
Sharon and Paul exchanged client experiences and decided that Distributors,
Inc., was looking at cloud adoption too narrowly. The CIO views cloud adoption
solely as a way of reducing costs and increasing IT efficiency. However, Sharon
and Paul knew that cloud computing could offer a much greater value proposi-
tion than cost reduction or expense control. Sharon concluded that a critical suc-
cess factor for Distributors’ is to develop and realize a cloud adoption strategy
that has the potential to be the next driver of business innovation by focusing
beyond cloud sourcing, where the emphasis is purely on sourcing IT services (e.g.,
platform, middleware, infrastructure, and applications) from a public cloud.
NOTE
A company’s recipe for success in adopting cloud computing entails
creating a strategy that explores a multitude of factors: business process as
a service, as well as software, platform, and infrastructure as a service.
However, these factors are not enough. Examining how cloud provides
access to new markets and increases the value proposition of IT are
essential elements of a cloud adoption strategy. Socializing a common
definition of cloud computing within the enterprise solidifies and
communicates an organization’s point of view and business objectives for
cloud adoption. Each of these subjects is explored later in this chapter.
Ten Expectations of Your Cloud Adoption Strategy
You can expect cloud to become an integral part of your company (if
it isn’t already) as cloud computing matures (e.g., standards and tech-
nologies), associated ecosystems (e.g., BPaaS or open cloud computing)
grow, and as more and more companies use cloud as a catalyst and engine
for business innovation. If you consider the range of application func-
tions, software and platform services available in the public cloud at a
fraction of the cost of traditional IT services, you can expect your busi-
ness units to continue adoption at an increased pace (without IT
approvals, mind you), while at the same time looking to both business
and IT stakeholders to participate in the decision process. Your teams,

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
3
whether directly making cloud purchases or not, can expect to offer
insights on how to use cloud to improve business outcomes, they should
be prepared and ready to provide insights relative to cloud vendor and
solution evaluations, and you should expect that guidance will be given
on how to adopt cloud for your company’s strategic advantage.
Cloud computing is more than a model for elastic workloads, cost
reduction, capital preservation, and improved IT efficiency. Cloud com-
puting is evolving and has the potential to be a major driver of your
business innovation, opening up new customer segments and markets.
Hence, your cloud adoption strategy should consider additional and
potential benefits as part of its target state. Key business and IT stake-
holders can accomplish this by collaborating and brainstorming where
several key questions are addressed:
■Where can productivity be improved with cloud adoption? For example,
can we provide business stakeholders new tools such as process modeling?
■Any opportunities to alleviate the IT queue, to eliminate IT for develop-
ing business solutions?
■What opportunities exist for innovation? Such opportunities might exist
in leveraging mobile computing, big data, analytics, or the holistic use of
all three.
■Any new geography that can be tapped for new opportunities? Perhaps
new markets can be examined for localized solutions or new services can
be offered.
■Can the workforce be transformed for greater collaboration and produc-
tivity?
■Where can we converge business and IT to create faster and greater
value?
■Do opportunities for experimentation exist to tap into innovation?
A first step toward understanding the business value of a cloud adoption
strategy is to explore the expectations or elements of an effective strategy.
The following list outlines ten expectations. As you read through this chap-
ter, you find applicability to both consumers and buyers of cloud services, as
well as for providers and sellers of cloud solutions. This list serves as a pre-
liminary table of contents for your cloud adoption strategy. The remaining
chapters provide guidance for evolving your strategy and infusing cloud
throughout your company using enterprise architecture.

1. Create Your Cloud Vision
Your cloud adoption strategy sets the direction toward realization of
your vision. Although this might sound trivial, coming to terms on a
common definition and perspective of cloud where stakeholders agree is
essential to have a common language to form a cloud vision. Two similar
definitions of cloud are listed below. The first is an enterprise cloud
provider’s definition perspective, while the second is a published indus-
try point of view:
1. Cloud is the industrialization of delivery for IT services. Cloud is a
new consumption and delivery model inspired by consumer Internet
services; enabled by service automation, virtualization, and stan-
dardization enabling self-service, economies of scale, flexible pric-
ing models, and workload based IT resource provisioning.
2. Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can
be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
effort or service provider interaction.2
Once you have agreed to a common perspective and definition, a logi-
cal next step is to determine your opportunities for increasing business
value. Your strategic entry point should be identified, your vision
articulated, and a roadmap to incrementally realize the vision put in
place.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy

■Opportunities for differentiation, market share growth, increased rev-
enue, capital preservation, transformation, or improved efficiency should
be identified as part of your vision, your cloud position.
■Entry points are where adoption commences pertaining to the identified
opportunities ranging from the basic offloading of workload to the
greater value of business innovation.
■Your vision is an amalgamation of strategic and tactical goals; use cases
that can make a difference today and some in the future. The vision
should enable innovation, which may require transformation to reach the
end state.
■Your roadmap is a living plan, managed and implemented incrementally,
grounded in risk management, and doing the art of what is possible.
It is necessary to realize that cloud computing continues to evolve,
which means its definition, use cases, and technologies are evolving. In
the opening scenario, Sharon faced a client experience in which the
vision was to eliminate all IT assets and services. Through analysis, it
became clear that business process sourcing to cloud was in scope and
not just offloading of IT assets. It was also clear that the full value
proposition of cloud was not well understood, thereby limiting the
vision of what is possible for Distributors, Inc. Sharon’s challenge was
helping Distributors, Inc., understand the value propositions of cloud
for its business and how to go about realizing the company vision while
helping the client maintain optimal business performance.
Depending on your vision, your entry point for cloud adoption can be
vertical where you cloud-source one or more business processes such as
order fulfillment; or your entry point can be horizontal where cloud is
adopted to provide cross-business unit capability. A good example of a
horizontal service is virtual desktops. You can choose an entry point that
provides both vertical and horizontal capabilities, where, for instance,
the mobility line of business commences use of virtual desktops prior to
other business units, and you can have more than one entry point. Your
end point outlines where you plan to be at a designated point in time.
Your roadmap, which is discussed later in this chapter, reflects the
actions required to reach your end point along with a timeline.

Your cloud adoption strategy should reflect your statement of posi-
tion. A cloud statement of position comprises three elements:
■Roles: Address roles of cloud consumer, provider, or hybrid.
■Service types and deployment models: Consider types of services (i.e.,
BPaaS, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS) and type of deployment (i.e., private, public,
hybrid, or community cloud).
■Sphere of influence: Clarifies the scope of your adoption strategy and 
identifies consumption patterns.
Figure 1.1 presents each of these elements, and the following text
elaborates further.
The first element of your statement of position describes the roles you
will play in the cloud. For instance, does becoming a cloud service
provider make sense for your company? Is the role of cloud service con-
sumer more appropriate for your organization? Perhaps you are consider-
ing a combined role or would prefer to take on the responsibilities of
cloud service integrator.

The second element of your statement of position describes the service
types and deployment models appropriate for your company. Valid serv-
ice types, as described in Table 1.1, are Business Process-as-a-Service
(BPaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Valid deployment models, as
described in Table 1.2, are public, private, hybrid, and community.
Table 1.1
Cloud Service Types
Service Type
Description
Business Process-as-a-
Service (BPaaS)
Business process services are any business processes (horizontal or
vertical) delivered through the cloud service model to multiple
internal or external consumers. Example services are employee
benefits management and procurement processes.
In BPaaS, the provider is responsible for delivery of the cloud
services.
Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS)
SaaS is generally (but not always) a public cloud offering. These
are predefined applications such as customer relationship man-
agement (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP).
In SaaS, the consumer uses provider-based applications that are
available in the cloud and accessible from various client devices.
Generally, consumers from multiple organizations share a single
application instance, with virtualization technologies employed
to segregate customer data and maintain privacy.
In SaaS, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying
cloud infrastructure with the possible exception of user-specific
configurations, such as to set up user profiles or to customize the
user experience.
Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS)
PaaS services deliver compute infrastructure plus a predefined
middleware stack that is typically structured for developers or
advanced IT users. Providers can choose to offer a variety of serv-
ice products that are configurable by the consumer. Examples
include database, Web, or application server software.
Configuration and management of these middleware resources are
the responsibility of the consumer, but the provider may offer to
maintain standard images once they are defined.
In PaaS, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying
cloud infrastructure, but has control over the deployed applica-
tions.

Table 1.1
Cloud Service Types
Service Type
Description
Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS)
IaaS provides cloud service consumers with the ability to rent
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing
resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary
software, which can include operating systems and applications.
IaaS can be delivered in a consumption-based business model, for
example, by the instance-hour used or gigabytes transferred; or as
a fixed fee for a virtual device with predefined capacity and con-
figurations. Either way, resources are accessed via the network,
typically over the Internet.
In IaaS, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying
cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, stor-
age, deployed applications, and possibly select networking com-
ponents, such as firewalls.

Table 1.2
Cloud Deployment Models
Deployment
Model
Description
Private cloud
Both the consumer of cloud services and the provider of those services exist
within the same company although services can be managed by a third
party. The services are utilized by a single company and the ownership of
the cloud assets typically resides within that same company.
Public cloud
The consumer and the provider of cloud services exist in separate enter-
prises. The ownership of the assets used to deliver cloud services typically
remains with the provider.
Hybrid cloud
Combines multiple elements of public and private cloud, including any
combination of providers and consumers, and might also contain multiple
service types. An example hybrid case study is provided in Appendix B.
Community
cloud
Supports a specific community of shared services that support shared inter-
ests (e.g., healthcare provider community). Ownership of the cloud assets
might be the organizations or a third party and the services can reside on or
off premise.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy

Service types are often referenced as a part of a cloud “stack,” as
depicted in Figure 1.2, to demonstrate the required level of structure,
standards, and the relationships among the service types. Higher layers,
such as BPaaS for instance, require more business process structure than
PaaS or IaaS. Deploying the underlying IT infrastructure should be
unnecessary when you purchase BPaaS services because these service
types are typically provided with underlying software, platform, and
infrastructure services. Lower layers of the stack, on the other hand are
foundational centric services such as compute and storage capacity.
These services are typically horizontal which means they require less
business process structure since they provide services for numerous ini-
tiatives and/or business processes.
Any of the service types are viable entry points for cloud adoption
addressing your specific business requirements. Some of the more com-
mon entry points are IaaS and PaaS. This approach can lay a foundation
for future adoption of cloud services that are farther up the stack. Each
entry point comes with its own set of requirements; for example, BPaaS

may require multilanguage support or geographic awareness for business
rules. As a consumer, you need to clearly understand and articulate your
requirements and usage scenarios prior to partaking in cloud vendor
(e.g., SaaS or BPaaS) negotiations. The same is applicable to providers
who must understand usage scenarios and workloads to meet service
level commitments.
The third element of your statement of position is sphere of influence.
The focus is your business users. Consider the role of the cloud service
consumer. What are viable consumption patterns, and who are the
expected end users of the cloud services that will be adopted? For exam-
ple, do you want the services to be available to your existing customers,
internal employees only, or both? Do cultural or bilingual considerations
exist, influencing your decision to invest in cloud or drive selection of
cloud providers? For example, the allowance of public clouds for
research and experimentation may be suitable while a private cloud is
required for searching driver records to address insurance claims. Similar
to the requirements as a cloud consumer, cloud service providers need to
know the sphere of influence of their service offerings. 
Just as service types and deployment models suitable for your organi-
zation should be articulated, workloads that are not suitable should be
specified. The cloud adoption strategy provides referential and action-
able guidance to enterprise stakeholders, and defining patterns in scope
and out of scope provides suitable guidance. Regulatory requirements
generally dictate acceptable and unacceptable deployment models. For
example, in several countries, it is not permissible for data to be trans-
ported across geographical boundaries. This regulatory requirement
impacts the use of public clouds for exports and international business
transactions.
2. Identify Cloud Use Cases
These scenarios present a set of archetypal usage scenarios to illustrate
a few of the ways in which cloud computing might be adopted and
leveraged for your organization:
■Business process improvement. Is there an opportunity to do any of the
following in one or more lines of business or IT:

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
11
■
Skills improvement in process modeling
■
Delivery maturity in lean six sigma, business process 
re-engineering or other process-centric programs
■
Platform provisioning where a BPM Enterprise Platform in the
cloud provides lines of business a ready-made platform and solu-
tion for business process management
■
Standardization of process models for accelerating horizontal and
vertical processes within the business
■
Transformation of how modeling is done from representing
process models as drawings to durable engineering artifacts that
can be more readily converted into deployed solutions
■Business intelligence and Big Data. Is there a benefit to business stake-
holders for improved decision making, and analytics, in any of these
areas:
■
Opportunity for predictive analytics to create models that can
foresee customer behavior with analysis of large data sets (struc-
tured and unstructured)
■
Analytical infrastructure providing for new classes of analytical
algorithms such as scoring engines, risk models, direct market-
ing models, or any online models
■
Information supply chain where the cloud platform provides data
warehousing, integration capabilities, and analysis capabilities
for cubes, Big Data, and streams
■Establishing or advancing an innovation center that would benefit from
additional computing power, infrastructure, middleware, or platform
support. The innovation center could take advantage or leverage any or
all of the cloud service types: BPaaS, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. The innovation
center focuses on exploring new opportunities for business value such as
e-commerce, mobile computing, Big Data, social media, or other. Any
business line requiring experimentation to explore new market opportu-
nities would leverage an innovation center.
■Development a proof of concept capability used by enterprise architects
or development teams to leverage cloud service types (primarily Paas or
IaaS) to shorten the time necessary to test drive new technology whether
for functional or technical fit (i.e., performance).
■Model-driven development platform using cloud for middleware, infra-
structure, and platform where a complete end-to-end life cycle of devel-
opment tools is provisioned through cloud computing. For example, the

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
12
cloud environment could be a multinode, multiproduct software environ-
ment, where there are different instances. This environment would sup-
port developers using modeling and design tools for more efficient
application development, testing, and management of solutions.
■Cloud provisioning life-cycle platform, which embraces all software con-
figuration management life cycles. Release management would be per-
formed as well as part of this life cycle.
■Cloud services. Cloud-based storage and disaster recovery are examples of
cloud services, while an example enablement candidate is secured access
to storage and disaster recovery services to mitigate business risks.
Your evolving portfolio of use cases (candidate services and enablers)
serves as a baseline for not only adoption but also management of your
internal and external clouds. At a minimum, your portfolio should con-
tain a description of the services, the business purpose, owners, enable-
ment candidates, and vendor-specific requirements.
3. Drive Business Innovation
Business innovation incorporates the process for exploring and con-
sidering new ideas such as new business models, collaboration, work-
force transformation, and alternative product development approaches,
leveraging new technologies (e.g., Big Data, social media, or mobile
computing), or simply alternatives for how to eliminate IT for business
solution development across your enterprise. At the core of business
innovation is business agility. Your cloud adoption strategy should fuel
innovation by providing techniques and patterns that equip your com-
pany and stakeholders to anticipate business challenges, address com-
plexities, and accelerate problem resolution.
Innovation should be a key element of your cloud adoption strategy.
Analyst firm IDC describes the emergence of the intelligent enterprise,
where the convergence of social networking, intelligent devices, ubiqui-
tous broadband, and analytics ushers new opportunities. For some com-
panies, this translates to cloud-based mobile applications tracking
inventory or leveraging social technologies to determine customer senti-
ment. Big Data represents the flood of new data where predictive or
sophisticated analytics can be used to make better decisions, allowing
retailers or telecommunication carriers, for example, to optimize deci-
sion processes such as pricing in response to real-time sales.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
13
You can try out applications and see if they fit your business situa-
tion, and you can do this at a fraction of the cost. For instance, numerous
wellness plans are available in the cloud that you might offer to employ-
ees with usage incentives. Considering the wealth of information and
interconnectivity enabled with cloud, your suppliers are instantly noti-
fied of product demands so that supplies remain available on demand.
Many universities require students to use secured compute servers and
dedicated supercomputers that are available in the cloud for assignments
as well as to promote social connectivity and team collaborations. Your
ability to provision fully configured development and test environments
without the expense of buying assets that you may only use for a season
allows you to address peak season performance requirements. And as you
will read in the case study presented in the Epilogue, “Thinking Beyond
the Race,” Sta-up International is excited about cloud and has decided to
become a reseller of storage as a service and virtual desktops as a service
in an effort to increase its international customer base although its tradi-
tional business model is communications. This is an example of leverag-
ing cloud to add new products and services that might be considered
outside your core competencies.
4. Define Business Outcomes and Projected ROI
Your cloud adoption strategy should be business-centric and contain
business cases that add value to your organization. While you might
think solely in terms of generating revenue streams or making more
money, a senior vice president from IBM responded to that notion in a
recent exchange pertaining to the business expectations of cloud, stating
that one of her business objectives is to drive cost takeout, in other
words keep revenues steady while eliminating costs so that profits
increase. Business outcomes of cloud adoption should be described and
corresponding ROI projected. Business outcomes must be measurable
and developed with key c-suite business stakeholders.
ROI is a financial ratio that indicates the degree of profitability of a
business. Simple cloud ROI is the result of calculating projected gains
from cloud investments divided by the projected investment costs. The
computation is
((total benefit – total cost)/ (total cost) * 100)
For example, if you expect to invest $2,500 in cloud services and sup-
port for year 1, and you project earnings of $10,000 after the first year as

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
14
a result of your investment, then your projected ROI is 300 percent,
computed as follows:
(($10,000 – $2,500) / 2500) * 100)) = 300 percent
A positive ROI indicates that your projected gains compare favorably
to your projected investment costs. To understand the true value of ROI
implications, you must compare your projected ROI with cloud to your
projected ROI without cloud. For instance, if without cloud, you project
a higher ROI in the first year, you should examine the projected benefits
for years 2 and 3 before making a final decision on moving forward with
cloud. Appendix B, “Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions,” con-
tains example ROI projections for adoption of a private cloud develop-
ment and test environment and considers the savings in comparison to
traditional hardware/software investments.
Examples of business outcomes include expanded market share to
become first in the market in retail sales or reduced operational costs by
5%. The ability to quickly expand business operations locally and
abroad due to instant, secure access to the information, software, and
hardware that without cloud adoption could take months to purchase
and deploy versus days is also a business outcome and an example agility
improvement. Another example is faster time to market of goods and
services, which stems from the improved cycles as a result of instant or
near real-time access to cloud solutions such as real-time analytical busi-
ness process as a service. Predictive business analytical applications are
available faster and at a fraction of the cost than it would take to launch
a project to conduct requirements analysis, design, development, test-
ing, and deployment. Examination of the total cost of ownership (TCO)
of cloud investments helps determine the lifetime costs associated with
acquiring and implementing cloud. TCO analysis along with ROI facili-
tates making prudent cloud investment choices.
Business areas and processes that benefit from cloud-sourcing are
essential inputs to TCO and ROI analysis. Strategies are not static but
fluid hence continued research of your business and market opportuni-
ties is necessary for your strategy to be active and impactful. It is essen-
tial that your strategy describes imperatives that can be realized with
use cases and supported by measurable business goals. Armed with
strategic imperatives where measurable business outcomes take center
stage the implementation can be tracked and realized.
Whether you adopt internal or external cloud services, knowledge of
your company, customers, and market accelerates sound cloud adoption

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
15
choices reaping optimal, enduring business benefits and viable ROI pro-
jections. A wealth of public knowledge exists on creating sound ROI
projections for cloud. Various models exist in the public domain provid-
ing an excellent set of models for ROI creation.
The Open Group provides ROI models demonstrating how cloud
benefits your company’s stakeholders. This is an excellent contribution
to the industry that should be reviewed as part of building an ROI
model for cloud and for developing cloud adoption metrics. In addition
to the models provided by the Open Group your ROI model should fac-
tor the following measurements:
■IT queue reduction as business stakeholders no longer require internal IT
or system integrators for IT services allowing the business to do more
with less
■Preservation of capital for key business imperatives reducing investment
dollars when developing and implementing solutions due to asset reuse
and availability
■Time to value improvement where a category of projects can now be
deployed faster
■Ability to innovate where capital preservation, IT queue reduction, and
time to value are all applicable to experiment, prototype, or research new
opportunities to create sustained value
5. Determine Opportunities for Cloud as a Fifth Utility
To ensure you are optimizing returns and controlling the level of risk
introduced, you should rationalize and determine supplemental actions
that support your cloud adoption strategy. This might mean, for
instance, as a cloud consumer creating a private cloud provider environ-
ment, for the potential use cases identified earlier. Creating such an
environment requires billing and metering tools. Determining opportu-
nities for cloud as a fifth utility (others are gas, water, electricity, and
miscellaneous utilities, such as trash removal or your telephone bill)
means leveraging cloud computing, where applications run over the
Internet, SaaS, without having to buy, install, or manage your own
servers. You run your company’s IT operations simply using a browser
and a high-speed Internet connection. Applications (SaaS), middleware
(PaaS), servers (IaaS), and network switches all sit in the cloud and are

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
16
managed by your cloud-computing vendor. The cloud ecosystem contin-
ues to evolve requiring continuous awareness of the growing cloud
ecosystem by your vendor management. Moving out of the comfort zone
of IaaS (a focus of traditional utility-based adoption) and onward to
BPaaS and SaaS planning will be required.
Utility computing is often compared to public utilities and the
metered accounting and billing mechanisms for electricity, water, and
other services rendered. Cloud computing can solely be the fifth utility,
providing IT as a service. During the mainframe days, multiple users
who were charged for the actual system resources consumed shared a
computer. As with cloud, mainframes are centralized, which drive costs
down due to economies of scale and increased efficiencies due to the use
of a high performing computer and timesharing, which made the main-
frame more affordable for both small and large companies.
Utility computing and its corresponding pay-per-use subscription
style services and flexible pricing structures should be included as a part
of your cloud adoption strategy in an effort to meet your consumption-
based goals for consumers. A difference in strategy, however, is that with
cloud, you are not limited to IT-focused outsourcing (as is the case with
utility computing). Instead, your emphasis is to optimize your business
processes, which might very well involve outsourcing all four of the
service types described in this chapter.
Grid computing links disparate computers over a network (public,
private, or Internet) to form a virtual system that solves problems that
have large processing requirements, often by dividing them into smaller
ones and carrying out computations simultaneously. Grid or high per-
formance computing (HPC) options should be considered as a part of
your overall cloud adoption strategy particularly for those large work-
loads that require distributed, parallel, and specialized processing.
Remember to discuss the risks and alternatives with your stakeholders
and of course your cloud provider unless you elect to be the provider and
consumer.
Several benefits accrue from leveraging the cloud as a fifth utility.
These include eliminating the need for upgrades, dealing with down
systems, and war rooms for trying to find or fix infrastructure issues.
Just as with any utility the cloud is always on, 24 by 7, which may pro-
vide availability improvement and continuous service. The ability to
access any application from anywhere is a powerful capability of cloud as
the fifth utility. Sites that must be adjusted for spikes because of 
promotions are advanced as cloud adjusts to the site’s performance needs.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
17
Finally, cash flow is improved with a subscription or pay-as-you go
model.
6. Specify Cloud Ecosystem
Your cloud adoption strategy should be viewed as a supply chain that
delivers computing power, BPM platforms, analytical platforms, develop-
ment platforms, services and applications such as CRM or ERP, and other
services. Like all supply chains its requires governance to address privacy
and security, and must be actively managed and optimized for all stake-
holders. The supply chain may contain a hybrid of service types and
deployment models. Cloud computing will be a driver for increasing busi-
ness value, where an early Stage 1 of your cloud computing supply chain is
to standardize and baseline where opportunities (i.e., cloud use cases) exist
for innovation and business improvement. Stage 2 is characterized by its
focus on capital preservation, cost reductions, and IT efficiency improve-
ments. Stage 3 stresses innovation, where the business takes advantage of
new opportunities that were not as viable without cloud computing. Stage
4 extends cloud computing to partners, suppliers, and the outside world.
This indicates that when choosing suppliers great care should be given
toward establishing your network of strategic partners, building both
short- and long-term relationships, and utilizing your ecosystem in a way
that maximizes business growth and stability. 
In the past, the notion of the extended enterprise centered on business
partner relationships coupled with end-to-end supply chain manage-
ment. Cloud has, however, brought a different perspective to the con-
cept. The performance of your business is only as good as the
performance of your cloud, which as a consumer you may not have total
control over. Your cloud adoption strategy describes actions in accor-
dance with your defined enterprise boundaries. For example, it makes
sense to express requirements for on- and off-premise visibility into the
performance of business critical cloud services. On the other hand, the
use of search engines, for example, Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft’s® Bing,
is noncritical, and therefore monitoring the information flow using
worldwide repositories as results are retrieved is simply not necessary.
What is relevant, however, is to know what providers are doing with
your data. For instance, besides returning results, you want to under-
stand how companies are using your credentials, such as who are your
providers reporting what you search on to and why, and what are your
provider’s content management policies?3

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
18
Your choices for cloud solutions must consider interoperability and
integration within your existing environment. If, for instance, you are
considering cloud services for your payroll needs, what are your inten-
tions for in-house payroll systems and processes so that you do not open
the door to fraudulent activities? It is important to consider and plan to
eliminate duplicate processing and systems, as certainly you want your
company to operate in a consistent manner, adhere to regulatory guide-
lines, and maintain all required certifications. In addition to perform-
ance efficiencies, this approach helps you prevent inappropriate systems
use or fraud. Subsequently, your cloud provider’s security model must
integrate with your existing security framework. Where it doesn’t, you
should develop compensating controls or document and accept the risk.
You must also be careful to control and maintain a system of record of
information, such as customer and billing data. If you do not do this,
you will end up with duplicate or excessive data sources that are difficult
to maintain and defeat the purpose of your investment in cloud, one of
which is simplifying business complexities.
You must consider the integration of cloud and the implications of
using cloud within your organization, across business units, across other
enterprises, and within the cloud itself. And as a consumer, one of your
central objectives should be to leverage cloud to simplify business opera-
tions. So while an element of trust is established between consumers and
providers, both parties can manage several requirements. For example,
explicit service level requirements—policies such as nondisclosures,
proactive management of information sources including establishing a
single system of record, and more importantly, appropriate and viable
service level agreements and operations (SLAs and SLOs).
7. Determine and Publish Stakeholder Involvement
It can be daunting to figure out who should be involved in the devel-
opment and evolution of your cloud adoption strategy; however, the bot-
tom line is your strategy should not be developed in a silo, given that
the information and insights that you need to establish a solid strategy
are dispersed throughout your organization. Understanding that this is
easier said than done, the more socialization on the relevancy of the
adoption to your business, and the more you listen and apply pertinent
considerations from enterprise stakeholders including business partners
and buyers as well as sellers of your services, the more effective and
actionable your strategy becomes.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
19
Consider the article, “Spotlight on the effective organization: the execu-
tion trap,” published by Harvard Business Review (HBR), in which the
author describes a choice-cascade model for strategy evolution. The goal is to
empower employees to willingly partake in the process as opposed to operat-
ing as “choiceless-doers”4 of executive decisions. The author encourages bidi-
rectional collaborations as signals that although executives might initiate
strategies, they are open to feedback and reconsideration, which leads more
readily to adoption. Continuous stakeholder involvement is essential to a suc-
cessful cloud adoption strategy.
8. Develop Metrics
One way to measure the value of your adoption strategy as well as the
value of using cloud in your enterprise is through the use of metrics.
This requires understanding your existing environment to assess the
implications of cloud decisions. Each metric should be traceable to your
business goals and expected benefits so that you are effectively measur-
ing the results, impacts, and business outcomes from cloud adoption.
The following examples provide a goal and corresponding metrics for
measuring the impacts of your cloud adoption strategy:
Goal
Metric
Reuse of cloud adoption strategy to
avoid cloud silos and cloud clutter
Number of cloud instances
Reduction in capital expenditures
Increase in number of customers
Improved customer satisfaction
Improved release cycles for projects due to
automation and standardization
Increased self-service opportunities
Additional metrics for measuring the impacts of cloud adoption can be
developed for continuous improvement of your cloud adoption strategy:
■Who is spending what on cloud by measuring the cost of cloud by busi-
ness unit
■How much does cloud cost as a percentage of line of business revenue
■Cost of cloud by workload
■Number of mobile applications deployed because of cloud
■Number of social media solutions enabled by cloud

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
20
■Reduction in IT queue by line of business
■Capital preservation by line of business
■Decrease in software license costs
9. Define Governance
Governance pertains to decision making at the right time by the right
business and technical stakeholders where decisions are implemented
and remain relevant in changing business conditions. Cloud-specific
governance includes stakeholder and decision rights establishment and
enablement, such as determining authority figures for procuring solu-
tions and the required level of stakeholder involvement; developing
cloud decision making processes, for instance, deciding that internal
social media usage is appropriate for collaboration while decisions are
finalized through steering committee meetings; and management,
which includes establishing and enforcing decommissioning policies for
cloud providers.
Cloud silos or cloud clutter where the goals for cloud computing frag-
ment or diffuse intent is a real possibility with any cloud adoption.
Implementing a governance strategy provides consistency in data usage,
integration, and policy management. Your cloud adoption strategy out-
lines the enterprise governance model that encompasses cloud. The gov-
ernance model refines and prioritizes during roadmap creation and
implementation. Chapter 5, “What About Governance?,” provides an
enterprise governance framework and elaborated discussions.
10. Develop Roadmaps
The purpose of the roadmap is to establish the technology investment
initiatives and to lay the groundwork for realizing your cloud vision.
The roadmap serves as a baseline for reviewing the plan and implemen-
tation strategy with the various stakeholders—thereby helping to estab-
lish a common cloud adoption strategy for communicating business
strategy, technology strategy, and laying a clear path toward accomplish-
ment of future business goals.
Your roadmaps describe the prioritized approach and alternatives for
reaching your target state, your vision. The roadmap reflects immediate
to three years of activity and includes targeted rates of adoption as well

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
21
as metrics. The metrics are used to assess continuously the success of the
roadmap item and to adjust as necessary. Roadmaps are derived from the
entry points with the necessary details to move forward with cloud
adoption while maintaining optimal business performance. Your
roadmaps are reflective of your current and anticipated business condi-
tions. For instance, if new product development is underway in your
organization, it is reasonable to commence your adoption with market-
ing and sales divisions in anticipation of increased product advertise-
ments and order fulfillment workloads. The archetypal usage scenarios
should be codified as actual use cases providing input of actual initia-
tives or projects in the roadmap.
The emergence of governance maturity models provides an opportu-
nity to further develop a roadmap. For example, most emerging models
leverage the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) process
approach, where the goal is to help organizations improve performance.
CMMI provides five maturity levels:
■Level 1: Initial where processes are unpredictable and poorly controlled
■Level 2: Managed characterizes processes are now controlled and 
managed
■Level 3: Defined where proactive management of processes and standards
are in place
■Level 4: Quantitatively managed where processes are measured
■Level 5: Optimized where the focus is on process improvement
In cloud computing, several such models (search “Cloud Maturity
Models”) have been published that should be reviewed for applicability.
Your roadmap may encompass moving toward level 5 of such maturity
models, or you may elect to develop your own maturity model. Your
roadmap describes how you advance in your defined maturity model.
You will learn more on applying CMMI in Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of
Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy.”
Harvesting the Value
An executive once stated, “If I forgot and left my strategy on an air-
plane and it was retrieved by a competitor, I would not be concerned.
Strategy does not work because it’s articulated or written down, strategy

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
22
works if people can implement the strategy.” Strategies become paper-
weights when there is no viable roadmap and the governance to make
the strategy happen. Strategies become nightmares when coupled with
expensive and time-consuming transformational and restructuring activ-
ities. Your cloud adoption strategy can avoid these pitfalls with a vision
grounded in use cases that produce strategic and tactical business out-
comes, governance focused on continuous improvement, metrics
designed to determine what’s working and what’s not, and a roadmap
that incrementally reaches the vision by creating outcomes that matter
to the business. Without a cloud adoption strategy focused on meeting
the expectations outlined, you are gambling with the performance of
cloud computing making a strategic, positive impact to your business.
Strategic planning and adoption guides decisions pertaining to the
inclusion and deliberate omission of cloud and helps realize and measure
the benefits that led to initial considerations. Examples are increased
profits, faster and more efficient procurement of assets, development of
products and services that customers want, optimized ROI, a more agile
and elastic capacity to adjust to changing market conditions, easier inte-
gration of cloud services, and innovative opportunities to expediently
bring competitive products and differentiating solutions to bear.
Summary
Our economic climate forces us to make our companies lean and effi-
cient with a strategic “lookout” for opportunities to do more with less.
As we recover from the economic downturn, many of you are expressing
the intent to continue on the lean path and are turning to cloud for per-
formance efficiencies, service optimization, and demonstrable financial
advantage. This is why it is important to develop a cloud adoption strat-
egy that helps identify where to begin and how to successfully proceed
with your journey. Your strategy must encompass candidate scenario
enablers along with the actual cloud services, and you must develop
roadmaps that drive positive, realistic business outcomes.
Your cloud adoption strategy is a critical success factor for providers
who need to be able to respond to your requirements for cloud comput-
ing and provide specifics on how they will meet service level agree-
ments. It is prudent to leverage cloud providers and vendors while
forming your cloud adoption strategy as they will be integral in its
development and implementation.

1: Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy
23
Cloud adoption strategies should be innovative and actionable; the
intention should be on business innovation, increasing business agility,
and while dealing with a world of increasing complexity, optimizing
your return on investment, and lowering your total cost of ownership to
preserve capital. Without a strategy your vision might be compromised
and growth and assurance of business value diminished over time due to
planning shortfalls and disappointing business results.
This chapter discussed ten expectations of a cloud adoption strategy,
including a vision for leveraging and increasing cloud computing value
and benefits that can be realized when the expectations are fulfilled.
Success depends on the ability to integrate across your value chain
(internal and external) and build upon the capabilities provided by oth-
ers as well as learned expertise. The next two chapters share activities
and techniques for developing a cloud adoption strategy and further
elaborates Sharon’s interchange with Distributors, Inc.

Sharon and her team conducted cloud adoption interviews with C-suite execu-
tives as well as business and IT leaders at Distributors, Inc., to further under-
stand their business objectives and requirements. Findings revealed the desire for
cloud-sourcing was driven by the lack of in-house resources to deliver products
and services to market when needed. Issues pertaining to business and IT per-
formance levels were shared, and high frustration levels were evident among some
of the interviewees.
Some of the interviewees displayed confidence that cloud-sourcing was the way
to go, but this information was based solely on what they read and from some
competitor testimonials. IT leaders were in agreement with cloud adoption
because they were stretched thin in their day jobs and would benefit from the
help. On the other hand, not all IT leaders agreed that all IT capability would
or should be delivered from the cloud.
However, what Sharon found most interesting were insights on why the focus
now on cloud, and what some described as new technology architecture. There was
a perception that the diverse and complex environment in play at Distributors,
Inc., was built because of silo planning and that current IT course and speed do
not support Distributors’ growth plans nor was it sustainable in the long term.

Business trends were unmistakable: time to market pressures, diverse regulatory
environments, and the continuous cost and margin pressures. Several
Distributors, Inc., executives commented that new growth must be sustained by
entering new markets and countries. Currently, this was a challenge given mar-
gin pressures and the cost of putting IT capabilities in those markets.
Sharon and her team made recommendations for Distributors to strategically
move forward with cloud. In the process, she shared with the team that cloud
should be incorporated into the enterprise architecture (EA) for current and
future-state cloud adoption, and why this incorporation would be required to
achieve tactical and strategic objectives of cloud computing. She further discussed
the business value of such actions as EA advances business and IT strategy
through codifying best practices and through its approach to governance—the key
organizational construct that ensures your strategic intent is realized through
initiatives and projects.
Your Integrated Business and IT Strategy
As EA evolves and becomes focused on business value outcomes1
through coordinated efforts of business and IT, it is important that cloud
is incorporated accelerating time to value. This inclusion is particularly
necessary for understanding the impacts of adoption and generating
shared value across your enterprise network. With cloud considerations
incorporated in EA, several assertions come to life:
■Your cloud adoption strategy becomes business centric and cost 
efficient.
■Your enterprise increases agility.
■You gain more benefits from enterprise portfolio management.
■Your projects when implemented naturally conform to cloud enterprise
standards due to the holistic and federated nature of EA.
The federal government, for instance, applies federated EA2 (Federal
Enterprise Architecture) principles for strategic alignment of initiatives,
information, real-time portfolio management, and asset reuse. A finan-
cial services company encompasses cloud in its enterprise reference
architecture to sustain situational-based card services enablement that
includes standardized on-boarding and credit verification services. More
details of these case studies and additional examples can be found in

2: Business Value of Incorporating Cloud into Your EA
27
Appendix B, “Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions.” These
examples demonstrate how the adoption of cloud improves agility and
enables increased value across your value networks.
Your EA is an evolving representation of your enterprise strategy and
business platform. That is, EA incorporates both the business and IT
architecture and specifies the standards necessary for realization. EA
should be written and stored in a way that makes it easy for all stake-
holders to leverage. Ensuring projects can exploit the architecture stan-
dard cloud components requires each part to be described and published
in an easy-to-use, easy-to-find catalog style and format. Incorporating
cloud considerations (public, private, and hybrid) and other aspects adds
value by strengthening your business agility.
Business agility is the collective capabilities and constructs allowing
a business to continuously transform to achieve its business outcomes, be
predictive, flexible, responsive, and launch business initiatives in times
of change and uncertainty. EA with cloud incorporated provides a cata-
logue of these capabilities. The ability of a business to continuously
adapt rapidly, effectively, and cost efficiently in response to changes in
the business environment is business agility, and EA increases the
opportunity for such. Adoption of cloud enables organizations to nimbly
adjust to and take advantage of emerging opportunities. For example,
the use of cloud can reveal opportunities that support the dynamic
means in which you conduct business (today, it’s Internet and desktop
productivity for your employees and lines of business, and tomorrow, it
might be that you run entire business operations from smart phones).
The perception of some prominent stakeholders is that EA is an IT
responsibility that exists solely to serve the IT community. However,
such adoption patterns fail to take advantage of the value of EA. EA
must include both business aspects of the enterprise as well as underly-
ing IT and operational strategies. In fact, the way your business
processes are managed can be a differentiator for you in the marketplace
in terms of agility, growth and industry perception; and internally in
terms of performance optimization and speed. The transformational
impacts of cloud on your business (not just IT) warrant enterprise con-
sideration and thus EA inclusion.
EA should be a living and evolving construct embodying business and
IT strategic and tactical ends. Considering this context, EA is defined
throughout this book as your integrated business and IT strategy, which
considers and directly influences your operational model. Cloud is

28
incorporated within your EA to drive business and IT alignment and
adoption; and to ensure consideration of internal and external enterprise
ecosystems with the adoption. Some expected outcomes are business
value endurance, enhanced ROI (return on investment), service opti-
mization, and stronger business performance. A primary value proposi-
tion of EA is driving portfolio planning in a strategic context and
directing change toward common enterprise goals. This is a primary rea-
son why cloud should be incorporated into your EA, so that the right
changes relative to readying your organization for cloud are determined
and enacted in the right way.
Figure 2.1 depicts EA with cloud incorporated. When cloud is incor-
porated into your EA, you naturally form an enterprise cloud adoption

strategy. Identifying viable projects that help realize your cloud adop-
tion requires a good set of models, capable of portraying the overall “as is”
and “to be” architectural landscape. EA provides these models for your
cloud adoption strategy.
Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption
Strategy,” elaborates on this topic with demonstrable examples on how
to incorporate cloud into your EA, and you find various viewpoints on
how to illustrate the core EA domains (business architecture, informa-
tion systems architecture, technology/infrastructure architecture, and
governance) with embedded cloud considerations. Each of these domains
supports respective cloud adoption entry points as discussed in Chapter
1, “Business Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy,” enabling you to deter-
mine the best, holistic strategy for your business.
For organizations that might not have an EA or don’t effectively use
an EA, an upcoming section, “What If You Do Not Use EA?,” elabo-
rates, with business scenarios, why EA should become visible and
actionable in your organization. The business benefits of embracing EA,
for effective enterprise cloud adoption, is described using examples.
Business Benefits of the Convergence
What are the impacts of your converged business, IT, and cloud strat-
egy? Convergence allows you to exploit all the benefits of cloud: con-
sumption based pricing models, speedy builds and delivery of products
and services, on-demand provisioning and decommissioning of what you
need when you need it with impacts that positively affect your enter-
prise core capabilities and beyond.
A primary benefit of convergence is business agility. Incorporating
cloud within EA enables you to better predict and respond to market
changes and environmental pressures rapidly and with optimal effective-
ness, which drives organizational agility that extends beyond technol-
ogy. Critical to measuring the effectiveness of convergence is the use of
the following:
■Key agility indicators (KAIs): How well your business can adapt to
change. KAI measures how well your company is sensing and able to
respond to the market fluctuations. Example KAIs are time to collaborate
across your enterprise network, your speed to adapt to a merger or an

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
30
acquisition prior to its occurrence, and time to reflect market demands
into your enterprise strategy.
■Key performance indicators (KPIs): How well you are performing
business as usual. KPIs measure your business based on performance or an
occurrence of an event. Example KPIs are rate of cloud adoption and per-
cent of business processes eliminated.
As Figure 2.2 illustrates, increased business agility, which is an outcome
of the convergence, has a positive impact on your business’s performance.
A second benefit of convergence is federation. Investing in cloud that
serves a single department or sits idle is a waste of resources. Federation
facilitates leveraging the cloud to a wider set of stakeholders within the
enterprise. Experiences show that federation should not be an after-
thought but a keen part of your enterprise strategy. Think about the
business complexities and adoption possibilities such as on-premise; off-
premise; security; all, part, or none of your business sourced from cloud;
varying service-types; and more, and the enterprise interoperability
requirements to support varying cloud scenarios.

Figure 2.3 illustrates how federation can be applied to optimize adop-
tion of departmental approved clouds. In the example, you as a consumer
request services from your private cloud (Cloud A) that applies your EA
standards and regulatory requirements to collaborate with other
approved public or private clouds to address your business requirements.
Federation, in this example, is about enterprise clouds seamlessly and
legally using other clouds to meet service level commitments. Legality
is important because the federated pattern takes into account enterprise
regulatory requirements and governmental restrictions. Two significant
benefits of applying federation are no additional asset investment
expenses and no additional sign on efforts, both due to the shared serv-
ices aspects of federation.
Many organizations begin EA at a divisional and propagate processes
and assets across divisions while respecting autonomy and specialized
departmental requirements. This concept is known as federation, where
each division retains autonomy while at the same time standardized
practices are introduced and applied in the organization. On a financial
services engagement, for instance, executive sponsors expressed specific
requirements to commence definition of EA, first as a model for the
Asset Management division, followed with strategic planning, reuse,
and governance across other organizations. With cloud embedded in EA,

the natural application of federation contributes to greater rewards and
sustained use of cloud investments.
For organizations that are early adopters of cloud, the best practices
that you apply and the experiences that you gain should be incorporated
into your EA so that other business divisions and tactical initiatives
apply the same best practices.
In the early stages of cloud adoption, it is natural to consider
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) as an
entry point. Because these are infrastructure related, you might consider
sole reliance on IT teams to determine your cloud opportunities, or you
might bypass IT as a whole and empower business units to purchase
solutions that are readily available. The problem with this model, and
this happens quite often, is the omission of integrated stakeholder per-
spectives and thus the omission of an integrated cloud strategy. So
regardless of your role, you need to consider the perspectives of business,
IT, and potential users of these services so that optimized value is real-
ized as you make cloud adoption decisions.
Recall from the chapter-opening scenario that Sharon listened to com-
plaints of stakeholders regarding performance levels that resulted in
high frustration levels. Well, a prominent problem was that
Distributors’ business and IT teams operated in isolation and did not
coordinate work efforts. This behavior resulted in IT solutions that the
business did not want and solutions that were delivered too late. In
addition, the business units did not set clear or realistic expectations,
primarily due to misaligned budgeting and planning processes between
the two teams. This is an example of organizational behaviors that
should not be carried forward with cloud adoption.
Instead, a third benefit of convergence, improved collaborations, should
transpire. Sharon brought this issue to the team’s attention and offered
ways to improve collaborations using basic EA principles. EA governance
and business architecture (BA) helps you identify the required coordina-
tion and tools necessary for achieving cross-collaborative business solu-
tions, while adding tangible business value.
Executives generally view enterprise architects as front-line contacts
and a conduit for translating business needs into IT needs. They trust
the advice of enterprise architects to guide them with thought leader-
ship and best practices. This means your EA practitioners need to be
well informed and able to discuss advantages and disadvantages of cloud

2: Business Value of Incorporating Cloud into Your EA
33
in the context of business enablement and transformation. At the same
time, decision makers look to your EA as a foundation for cloud enable-
ment and a baseline for making strategic adoption decisions. If enter-
prise architect resources are ill-equipped, or unavailable, decision
makers might turn to less reliable sources for guidance, which simply
does not lead to positive outcomes. Accordingly, a fourth benefit of con-
vergence is sustained trust and emerging reliance on EA resources for
cloud purposes. Consider the following:
■Consumers rely on EA for simplicity in cloud adoption, which involves
interoperability with existing enterprise initiatives and standardization
(e.g., self-service catalogs or integration with existing IT—front, middle,
and back office—solutions and services). Simplicity in this context means
your ability to make more informed decisions is easier due to readily
available information that is represented through EA, while enabling
faster fulfillment of service requests.
■Providers rely on EA for enablement requirements such as the network,
storage, and relative assets so that cloud services perform. An added capa-
bility, such as ubiquitous access to your cloud, enables consumers to use
their technology of choice from any location at any given time and thus
adds to your value as a service provider. At the same time, performance of
your network (which is generally taken for granted) can negatively
impact your credibility if consumers perceive slowness or bottlenecks.
■Systems integrators rely on EA for an understanding of business core
competencies and cross-agency or line of business collaboration—they use
these inputs to help customers choose business processes and associated
workloads that are suitable for cloud.
Figure 2.4 illustrates some scenarios that must be considered when
determining whether cloud is appropriate for your company. Reading
from the top left to right, the consumer leverages a storefront to pur-
chase cloud solutions from a marketplace. Business support services
(BSS) are components put in place by providers so that you can order
cloud services. Some examples are the service offering catalog or as illus-
trated in the marketplace, your dashboard profile and entitlements, pric-
ing and rating of services, accounting and billing of services per the
terms and conditions, and offering management. The BSS are the com-
ponents that you, the consumer, see and directly interface with.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
34
Operational support services (OSS) are required to run the cloud environ-
ment; these components actually carry out your specific service requests.
While the component details are seamless to you, some core capabilities are
service provisioning, monitoring and event management, automation, virtu-
alization, image management, incident management, and capacity/
performance management. Your EA should contain a list of company
approved service offerings and providers. Your EA should provide guidelines
for cloud vendor selection as well as BSS/OSS considerations.
Your backend systems are significant when it comes to cloud con-
sumption. As discussed in the previous chapter, it is important that
should you choose to leverage the cloud for key processes that you avoid
duplicate systems and processes, and maintain a single system of record
of data. In the example, the consumers’ enterprise standard is to use a
predetermined payment gateway to process online payments while
accounts are managed using the Financials system that, in this case,
addresses billing and subscriber reconciliations. Your EA should be a
reference point for you to understand approved enterprise systems and
all official systems of record. This information helps you understand the
key integrations so that your decision to adopt cloud is holistically
thought through and the impacts of adoption are understood from a
companywide point of view.

Again, returning to the specifics in the chapter-opening case study,
Sharon evaluated the core competencies of the division in scope, and
based on ROI and risk analysis along with her understanding of business
goals, drivers, key processes, and pain points—all attributes of BA—she
produced a prioritized list of cloud enablement and service candidates.
At the top of the list were marketing and advertising and a Human
Resource Information System (HRIS) in which she proposed vendor
evaluations as part of the requirements for BPaaS and SaaS enablement.
Key vendor assessment areas include financial viability, product strategy,
industry-specific compensation management, and pricing for services.
Key functional assessment areas include campaign management, per-
formance management, and key HR and payroll processes. Interestingly
enough, IaaS and PaaS opportunities were identified, but Sharon did not
isolate these as suggested entry points.
In a nutshell, your EA should be leveraged to influence your cloud
investments along with any usage and integration decisions. When you
can think about EA and cloud in the same breath with coordinated
processes and resources, then you have an EA that can execute at the
speed of business. This is why an investment in EA is prudent—to equip
and enable your business with the right technologies and resources at
the right time.
Developing Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
Keeping in mind that EA is your integrated business and IT strategy,
you can leverage the EA methodology to prepare and validate your cloud
adoption strategy, as depicted in Figure 2.5. The EA method is applied
to form your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. This leads to a fifth ben-
efit of convergence, which is optimized ROI and total cost of ownership
(TCO), where a significant portion of this optimization is attributed to
strategic asset development and reuse. Recall the expectations of your
cloud adoption strategy were described in Chapter 1 with elaborations
on both ROI and TCO.
The following is a list of steps (or phases) for defining and evolving
EA with cloud incorporated. The section demonstrates a prescriptive
technique to prepare and validate your cloud adoption strategy. You use
EA to identify and prioritize cloud enablement and service candidates,
establish an adoption roadmap, and conduct governance of the cloud
implementation and adoption. As you read on, it is important to note

36
1. Conduct initial planning: Conduct initial planning of the engage-
ment, determine stakeholder requirements, and determine your
delivery approach. This phase is often referenced as the homework
phase. During this phase, you plan activities that enable you to
determine your cloud adoption goals and objectives.
2. Understand your current enterprise capabilities and establish your
vision: Conduct evaluations of the business and IT (including opera-
tional) landscape. Include company resources (people, process, infor-
mation, and technology) and the capabilities required for
establishing your cloud vision.
Here is where you determine your cloud position as a company.
3. Baseline and define your future state business architecture: Using
a prescriptive approach, capture the following items so that it is
clear which relationships create value for the business and to ensure
that an appropriate level of traceability exists for managing change
as your company transforms and grows:3

■Key business functions
■Key business interactions and interrelationships with partners,

■Business process models
■Key performance and agility indicators relative to the various 
business processes
■Business information model, which is the key information required
to run your scope of business
Here is where commencement of cloud enablement and service candidates
occurs, integrating with your business architecture (BA). In this phase,
your governance approach is also determined and outlined. Business
Process-as-a-Services (BPaaS) enablement is a focus area, and it is expected
that BA will influence cloud adoption decisions in the other domains.
4. Baseline and define your future state application architecture and
data architecture: Derive which information systems are relevant to
your company, and what those systems need to do; determine the
required applications and the major types of information sources,
content, and high level relationships.
Here is where commencement of your cloud enablement and service
candidates occurs and integrates with your information systems archi-
tecture. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) enablement is a focus area, and it is
expected that associated application and data requirements will influ-
ence cloud adoption decisions in downstream domains.
5. Baseline and define your future state technology and infrastruc-
ture architectures: Map application and information requirements
from the previous step into a set of software, middleware, and hard-
ware building blocks.
Here is where commencement of your cloud enablement and service
candidates occurs and integrates with your technology and infrastruc-
ture architecture. PaaS and IaaS enablement are general focus areas and
cloud-specific decisions should be traceable to steps 3 and 4 to help
drive business value.

6. Conduct strategic gap analysis and transition planning: Derived
from a compilation of the findings collected during steps 2 through
5, conduct strategic gap analysis and prepare transition plans for
evolving to your target state. Gaps include identification of key
building blocks, such as the need to re-train staff to support the
identified cloud business opportunities.
Here is where your enterprise cloud adoption roadmaps are formed.
7. Conduct implementation planning: Using inputs from the prior
steps, prepare implementation plans to ensure that activities are
coordinated and prioritized.
Here is where your cloud implementation plans are developed and proj-
ects initiated.
8. Govern the implementation: Govern the EA and ensure that proj-
ects are implemented to the standards and per the strategic
roadmap. Determine how change is to be managed and include
methodologies and tools.
While governance is an ongoing activity, here is where governance
of your cloud implementation commences.

information systems architecture for use within that organization.4
What If You Do Not Use EA?
In practice, it is unlikely that you do not have an EA because it is
your integrated business and IT strategy, but it is likely that the disci-
pline of EA is not practiced at all or it is practiced insufficiently.
Referencing Figure 2.5, recall the terms prepare and validate. The 

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
40
diagram implies that although not required, EA is recommended to val-
idate that you meet the ten expectations, but more importantly to
ensure preparation and development of an actionable enterprise cloud
adoption strategy.
The scenarios in the following sections demonstrate the three business
benefits of embracing EA principles to develop your strategy:
■Effective business transformation
■Reducing costs and redundancies
■Developing or refining your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
Scenario 1: Effective Business Transformation
Distributors, Inc., required assurance that public cloud adoption
would transform business operations without causing downtimes. This
assurance was in direct response to executive support of using cloud
services to improve product delivery cycles and to apply widespread
adoption—beyond immediate departmental needs. Though Distributors
did not have an EA (per se), Sharon worked closely with the vice presi-
dent of business process transformation and the recently hired enterprise
architect applying business architecture (BA) concepts and governance
to gain an understanding of goals and drivers, key corporate events, and
categorizations of differentiating and rudimentary processes. This
approach enabled her to determine opportunities to improve business
operations with cloud-sourcing. Together, they formed a visual depic-
tion of the EA with an emphasis on BA as an immediate starting point
and for future reference for others to use to guide cloud decision making.
Sharon addressed each of the ten expectations including initial formation
and prioritization of cloud enablement and service candidates, and the team
developed a three-year enterprise cloud adoption roadmap. Significant bene-
fits were the opportunity to offload rudimentary workloads to cloud, a shift
of IT resources to focus on more strategic and business critical tasks,
improved governance and coordination of budget and planning activities
across business and IT, and refinements to existing governance processes to
include cloud as well as other enterprise recommendations.

41
Scenario 2: Reducing Costs and Redundancies
A South African cell phone company experienced test and develop-
ment environment resource availability issues, poor scheduling processes
for sharing resources, and a significant amount of test server waste due
to poor enterprise governance and management. The company experi-
enced a situation where every project request for test and development
resources was easily approved and virtualized capacity went unreleased
once development-testing initiatives were completed.
Building and maintaining the enterprise environments that now
incorporate cloud involved a multitude of tasks that required involve-
ment and coordination across various teams. The team embraced EA
governance and management to overcome the obstacles generated from a
complex, hybrid IT landscape with issues that included an over prolifer-
ation of cloud environments and an architecture review board that
needed to actively engage in cloud adoption, procurement, and excep-
tion processes.
In this case study, the financial benefits were projected over a five-
year timeframe to be $1.9 M, breakeven (BE) in 8 months, net present
value (NPV) of $1.9M, and a total return on investment (ROI) of 316
percent. You can find more on this case study in Appendix B.
Scenario 3: Validating and Forming Your Enterprise
Cloud Adoption Strategy
Provider A (a private cloud provider in financial services) reviewed
the ten expectations of a cloud adoption strategy and conducted a formal
assessment to address each for an organization. Provider A created the
adoption strategy referencing an industry provided EA methodology
that contained steps similar to those described in this chapter as a check-
point and for validation of the completeness of the strategy. Provider A
ultimately formed an enterprise cloud adoption strategy, executed the
strategy, and continues evolution today.
While this initiative was an infrastructure focus at the start, the
strong business collaboration and interdependencies excited the business
units in a manner that they actively engaged and are planning use of the
cloud solutions to accelerate their business models. In addition, IT orga-
nizational improvements surfaced and were implemented as a result of
cross-divisional teaming that include centralizing a decentralized IT
organization.

Summary
When you think about cloud, you may likely presume that you don’t
need an EA, thinking that you will outsource all of your business needs
to someone else. In reality, you need your EA for overall business conti-
nuity whether you consider cloud-sourcing as a small or large percentage
of your operations. In fact, your EA is more critical the more you lever-
age system integrators and third parties for your delivery of IT services.
EA provides both the standards and guidelines for third parties to oper-
ate while providing you with the framework for bringing back in-house
at selected times those services or capabilities that provide better return
if sourced in-house.
Your integrated business and IT strategy ensures that your business
will perform by first and foremost enabling your company for cloud con-
sumption and second, focusing your company on choosing the right
strategy, projects, and business solutions for the business outcomes that
make a difference. From an adoption perspective, you can use EA to
identify and prioritize enablement candidates and cloud services, estab-
lish an adoption roadmap, and conduct governance of the adoption in
your organization. The following list summarizes the value statements
of incorporating cloud into your EA as discussed in this chapter:
■Business agility which directly attributes to performance optimization
■Federation
■Increased collaboration
■Sustained and emerging EA capabilities
■Optimized cloud ROI and TCO
■Integrated business transformation
■Reduced costs and redundancies
■Enterprise cloud adoption strategy
Discussed were correlations between organizations with an EA, well-
defined or not, and techniques for meeting the ten strategic expectations
of a cloud adoption strategy (from Chapter 1). Included also is a section
specifically for those who may not have or use EA, or feel as though your
EA is inadequately applied in your organization. To help clarify some of
the benefits of embracing EA principles in your cloud adoption, three

business scenarios were provided—one of which is Distributors, Inc.
Although the use of EA principles is optional, the scenarios share bene-
fits of applying some key principles to prepare or refine your strategy for
cloud adoption so that you reap optimal benefits.
While this chapter focused on the business value of incorporating
cloud into your EA, the next chapter introduces you to the life cycle of
an enterprise cloud adoption strategy, sharing practical guidance and
some applied experiences on how to augment your EA with cloud con-
siderations. You will also find discussions relative to the applicability of
service oriented architecture (SOA) and the implications to your plans
for cloud adoption.

In the previous chapters, you learned about the business value of developing a
cloud adoption strategy and the value of incorporating cloud into your enterprise
architecture (EA). You also learned some EA principles that you can embrace to
help you determine and develop the appropriate strategy for your company. Armed
with an understanding of the value of enterprise architecture for cloud adoption,
you are ready for this chapter, which describes the life cycle of your enterprise cloud
adoption strategy, an outcome of integrating cloud into your EA. You use the life
cycle as your foundation for strategically planning your cloud adoption as well as
to evolve your EA to include cloud specific goals, cloud standards, best practices,
and project guidance on cloud usage. The focus is “how and what to” incorporate to
ready your company for success along your cloud adoption journey. In this chapter:
■You review supporting cloud adoption activities and learn key work arti-
facts—points of view for documenting details such as your organization’s
readiness for cloud adoption and models for capturing your cloud service
portfolio. These work artifacts can be leveraged with cloud providers for
requirements specificity, and they should be added to your EA so that
your business goals are realized through active governance and manage-
ment using EA.

Strategically plan and position your company for successful cloud adoption.
The following sections examine each phase of the cloud adoption life cycle in
greater detail.
Initial Planning
The initial planning phase involves exploration of your business to
establish the context for enterprise cloud adoption and produce the ini-
tial, high level plan. You should review the existing case studies, such as
those depicted in Appendix B, “Cloud Case Studies and Common
Questions,” to justify development and execution of your strategy.
In addition to business and IT executives, you should assign an enter-
prise architect with cloud business strategy and governance experiences
as this leadership facilitates the process now and in subsequent phases.
Requests for Information and Proposals (RFIs/RFPs) are submitted for
budget, planning, preliminary return on investment (ROI) analysis, and

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
47
vendor selection criteria are determined. Security considerations are
incorporated throughout each phase as is governance.
NOTE
At this point, you are focused on determining and developing the appro-
priate cloud adoption strategy so vendors with synergistic strategies,
adoption, and governance experiences are selected.
Key activities in the initial planning include
■Determine business context: Your business context helps stakeholders
understand the purpose, goals and expected business outcomes for cloud
adoption. Adoption of cloud computing must be treated as a strategic
choice not a technology or outsourcing choice. Cloud is a huge change in
how you acquire and use technology and how you interact and support
your employees and your customers.
Envision new opportunities, new markets, and where cloud computing
accelerates the strategic direction of your company.
Envision an IT infrastructure capable of supporting a rapidly changing
business model—one in which IT is not a queue or bottleneck for new
business capability.
Envision a computing architecture in which platform or systems no
longer constrain business agility—one in which business solutions could
be composed rapidly and deployed on demand to any authorized user on
any system, anywhere in the world.
This is your vision for a powerful new computing architecture. This
vision is not about building castles in the sky but rather about a target
state for your new computing environment fueled by cloud computing.
■Describe the business environment, boundaries, and targeted bene-
ficiaries of your strategy: This is where you get more specific using sce-
narios and or use cases to describe what will be possible, what will be
different, what future business capabilities will be made possible with
cloud computing.
You examine the benefits of cloud adoption and these benefits translate to
scenarios, which accelerate realizing strategic imperatives.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
48
You work with key stakeholders to identify, detail, and prioritize use
cases for cloud adoption. These use cases are specific and detailed such
that all stakeholders see the value proposition of cloud adoption.
■Determine required stakeholders: Some lines of business or some busi-
ness processes will gain greater value of cloud adoption than others.
Adoption may create dependencies between stakeholders and processes.
Hence, key stakeholders must be understood and identified by key initia-
tives for cloud adoption. Stakeholders can make or break the success of
cloud adoption in terms of their willingness to sponsor the transformation
required in organizational changes, governance, vendor partnerships, and
possibly technology adoption. Stakeholder influence must be considered
along with their ability to motivate and navigate their key influencers.
■Explore cloud case studies: Gaining visibility into what other compa-
nies have experienced as value, risks, and lessons learned from cloud
adoption is essential. This requires working with analyst companies,
technology vendors, and system integrators to understand the art of what
is possible with cloud. Grounded in the context of actual successes of
other companies’ business results with cloud adoption.
■Establish your approach for developing your strategy: Making a
determination of how the strategy will be developed and realized is essen-
tial. Strategy without implementation is worthless as it’s the implemen-
tation of the strategy that creates business results. Developing a strategy
armed with an actionable roadmap or plan is a requirement.
Determining whether facilitated workshops, blogging or social collabora-
tion, or all of the above will be used to solicit input and feedback for
strategy development is required. This is where identifying the key
stakeholders makes a difference because interviews with each will be
required to define the approach as well as defining the strategy.
Publishing your high level plan and a clear set of expectations for moving
onward to the next phases of the life cycle is necessary.
■Establish vendor selection criteria: Understanding your partners nec-
essary to realize your cloud adoption strategy defines key elements of
your eco system for cloud adoption. Determining where gaps lie in your
current cloud capabilities that are necessary to reach your vision makes it
possible to radically improve and implement your cloud strategy. The
vendor selection criterion becomes a tool for selecting and maintaining
the necessary vendor and partner mix.

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
49
■Secure executive sponsorship: Identifying and gaining commitment
from the necessary executives are fundamental to successful cloud adop-
tion. Executive sponsors must possess authority to make binding deci-
sions and the willingness to exercise this authority. Hence, executive
sponsors must be cultivated.
Key work artifacts resulting from the initial planning include
■Business context, which describes the future for your organization in
adopting cloud—for example, new business models enabled or new capa-
bilities made possible.
■High level plan, which is more than a Gantt chart. It should consist of a
plan of projects along with the expected business outcome to be realized,
the project owner, metrics for gauging the success of the project, depend-
encies and risks that must be managed.
Enterprise Capabilities and Cloud Vision
It is essential that you understand your enterprise goals and objec-
tives. You need this information so that you establish a realistic cloud
adoption strategy, and just as with EA you want alignment between
your enterprise vision and your strategic vision for cloud adoption so
that activities and outcomes add value to your organization. Specifically,
you want to understand your enterprise goals and objectives in the fol-
lowing areas:
■New capabilities that the business needs to bring to the market in the
next 12 months
■Services or applications currently constrained due to time to market needs
■Opportunities to preserve capital or avoidance of operating expense
■Requirements or needs to provide ubiquitous access to consumers, cus-
tomers, or devices
■Needs for improved scalability

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
50
Factoring in your understanding of enterprise goals and needs into
the formation of your cloud vision provides the business context to make
cloud computing transformational for your business. That is, the busi-
ness use of technology changes as technology related business risk is
identified and managed; and IT queues get eliminated as a barrier for
creating new business capabilities.
All of this requires you to plan for governing your cloud adoption
strategy as it ensures appropriate development with proper controls for
progression with business continuity, and upon execution governs
implementations so that cloud projects are in alignment with your strat-
egy. The introduction of any new technology or technology paradigm
shift creates pressure on the organization. Previously, enterprise archi-
tecture may have evolved solely to address internal provided technology
solutions, and now it extends to address unique aspects of cloud comput-
ing in improving agility, enabling new business models, or simply pre-
serving capital investments.
Questions such as the following must be answered during this phase
of the life cycle:
■Is your business and IT aligned? If not, can cloud computing facilitate
this convergence between business and IT?
■Do your applications and IT architecture support your changing market
needs?
■Is your IT environment inflexible?
■How does your cloud adoption strategy support strategic imperatives—
that is, your company’s vision?
■How is your company performing today—that is, what’s not working
that would make a difference in business performance?
■Does cloud computing make your processes more effective and more effi-
cient?
■What cloud business adoption patterns are suitable for your company?
■Who is accountable for making cloud adoption decisions?
■What is your organizational readiness capacity for cloud adoption? 
■How will you ensure that your cloud adoption strategy is realized?

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
51
While you might have started preparation of your business case in the
previous step, it is most likely that stakeholders require additional
information to sustain initial approvals. In this second phase, you focus
on understanding your overarching ability to undertake or extend busi-
ness operations to support private, public, hybrid, and/or community
clouds. Approaches for obtaining information include conducting
visioning workshops and capability assessments. Pilots and/or proofs of
concepts are optional, but highly recommended.
NOTE
It is important to recognize that a proof of concept (PoC) is not intended
to be a production deliverable. It is generally applied to validate or
demonstrate a capability such as a new technology or product feature. A
pilot, on the other hand, is usually intended as an early production deliv-
erable and requires change control and requirements management.
Experiences show that projects can quickly get out of control when the
two are inappropriately applied. For instance, your PoC becomes a pro-
duction deliverable and you are soon required to manage defects although
that was not the original intention, or there is no change control applied
to the pilot and it therefore becomes dormant. Be sure to explicitly spec-
ify your desired outcomes (i.e., success criteria) and then plan your PoCs
and pilots accordingly.
Key activities in the enterprise capabilities and cloud vision include
■Develop your cloud decision model: Developing the cloud decision
model is described in Chapter 4, “Identifying Cloud Candidates.” This
model provides the use cases for cloud adoption based on strategic goals
of the business. This model is essential to understand the future state
made possible for your enterprise with cloud adoption. This decision
model is grounded in the reality of what is possible coupled with the
optimism of a future state.
■Develop your cloud business case and ROI inputs: The business case
and corresponding return on investment (ROI) model should look at a
comprehensive cloud adoption versus ad hoc adoption. It’s not easy to do
ROI analysis as most companies use intuition or guesswork. You might

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
52
also easily spend months or a year doing ROI analysis necessary for busi-
ness case development. Using the following approach can help:
1.
Create a benefit value tree where when selecting benefits (such as
those described in Chapter 1, “Business Value of a Cloud
Adoption Strategy”) you distill the value drivers for cloud adop-
tion such as capital preservation, increased time to market, new
business opportunities, workforce transformation, accelerated
time to market, and so on. Scenarios or use cases should be
created for each value proposition..
2.
Identify the applicable cost scenario for each use case.
3.
Calculate the initial, simple return.
4.
Assess and select the cost scenario for the second and subse-
quent implementations.
5.
Keeping the benefits constant, calculate the returns for the sec-
ond and subsequent implementations.
■Assess your enterprise’s cloud adoption maturity level: Understanding
shortfalls between your target state, your cloud vision, and the current
state is essential for successful planning and realization of your cloud
adoption strategy. Using the traditional CMMI (Capability Maturity
Model Integration) thinking, organizations can easily determine whether
they are in the formative stages or optimized stages of cloud adoption
maturity. Figure 3.2 depicts this model. This determines what level of
assistance is required to move faster or whether the current pace is suffi-
cient. You should plan for improvements and incorporate this input into
your roadmap as a natural outcome of this assessment.
■Conduct vendor selections: A vendor selection process is necessary to
select the partners and vendors for enablement of your cloud adoption
strategy. A team should be assembled with a vested interest in the cloud
selection process. The first task that the vendor selection team needs to
accomplish is to define, in writing, the service, capability, and features
required from a partner. This gets further elaborated into a defined set of
business and technical needs or requirements. Also, define the vendor
requirements. Finally, publish your document to the areas relevant to this
vendor selection process and seek both internal stakeholders and vendor
inputs. Now you are ready to select vendors.
■Determine areas to assess to fully understand your capabilities to
succeed with cloud adoption: Figure 3.3 illustrates the cloud capabil-
ity assessment areas. Customer and market insights provide clarity on the
art of what is possible and how other companies are both innovating and

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
53
differentiating themselves with cloud computing. Areas where business
innovation can occur must be assessed and understood. Are your EA
and/or SOA capability where it needs to be for the cloud adoption
strategy to be successful? Assessing yourself in these areas provides a
baseline for improvement and successful realization of your cloud
adoption strategy.
■Outline your enterprise governance strategy: Governance will be
mandatory for achieving the goals of your cloud adoption strategy. This
includes defining roles and responsibilities for stakeholders essential to
cloud adoption.
Your EA governance processes should be utilized, as EA will be a critical
success factor in accelerating cloud adoption. Your governance should
include a governing body that can create and manage the following
aspects of a cloud computing environment:
■
Policies
■
Procedures
■
Organizational effectiveness
■
Accountability and reporting
■
Communications
■
Standards adaptation
■Secure executive endorsements: Making sure key executive stakehold-
ers and the executive sponsor are onboard and committed is another criti-
cal success factor of your cloud adoption strategy. Establishing steering
committees or other mechanism for reporting and regular, timely com-
munication is required.
Key work artifacts resulting from the enterprise capabilities and
cloud vision phase include
■Cloud Vision, which has a vision statement. Examples of vision state-
ments include
■
The enterprise cloud adoption strategy is the playbook for cloud
adoption at our company. We will use cloud computing to drive
revenue growth of 50 billion by 2017 and promote our business
theme “Win, Drive, and Innovate through the use of smarter
business technologies.”
Motivation: Business value is maximized through consistent and
effective adoption of cloud solutions.

■
We will adopt strategies that expand business efficiencies by
enabling our enterprise to operate more effectively during con-
stantly changing business conditions, with ready access to global
markets while delivering enterprise-grade performance and cross-
border compliance.

stating clearly how you expect the value propositions for cloud computing
to materialize. You can derive aspects of the vision document by conduct-
ing a cloud adoption maturity assessment. Your Cloud Vision document
may be necessary for final executive endorsements and to firm detailed
plans.

How will cloud service types get distributed within your company or
a specific business unit? In other words, what percentage of cloud-
sourcing will be Business Process-as-a-Service (BPaaS), Software-as-a-
Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-
Service (IaaS), or other emerging service types?
Broker
Should you leverage a third-party company (e.g., a cloud consultant
or service integrator) to make cloud adoption decisions or suggest rec-
ommendations for you?
Bundling
Is your preference to buy bundled offerings such as SaaS that is pack-
aged with additional cloud solutions and/or services?
Diversification
What cloud service types and deployment models make the most
sense for your company?
Federation
Is it feasible to standardize the use of multiple clouds to collaborate
to solve your business challenges without your explicit request prior
to each occurrence?
Rebalancing
Will you govern and manage your cloud portfolio such that the bene-
fits balance with solution alternatives and update your portfolio
accordingly? For example, shift from IaaS (bottom up) to more BPaaS
(top down) or rebalance cloud-sourcing and outsourcing for greater
business impacts and to stir innovation.
Resell
Are you interested in reselling cloud services that you buy? And if so,
how will you manage profitability?
Self-Service
Should direct interactions with cloud providers be permitted for mak-
ing cloud purchases, and if so, how and for which stakeholders?
Sourcing
Should you invest in-house, outsource, or cloud-source business solu-
tions?
Trade
How will you handle unused assets due to cloud adoption? Will you
sell the assets, repurpose in your organization, trade (e.g., rent out use
of assets* or spot trade)?

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
57
The successful adoption of cloud computing increases with organiza-
tions having effective enterprise architecture practices. Organizations
without effective EA practices can start with the transition to cloud
computing. Maturity models have come under criticism and praise, but
nonetheless such models provide a tool for performing gap analysis when
adopting new architectures or computing models.
Figure 3.2 illustrates common enterprise capability measures that are
derived from the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI).1 The
model is frequently used for EA capability assessments. By applying the
cloud-specific considerations discussed in the next section, you can use this
maturity model to determine your cloud adoption capability and develop an
actionable, comprehensive strategy suitable for your business.

Enterprise cloud adoption—Capability Maturity Model
1. Initial: EA program is not well-defined and most likely generated
solely by and for IT. Projects tend to run over budget and success is
nonrepeatable. Company has exploratory or project-specific cloud
adoption capability.
2. Managed: EA program is forming. There is some manageability and
repeatability across departments; however, project compliance in
the organization is unpredictable and usually reactionary in nature.
Company has departmental and business unit cloud adoption 
capability.

3. Defined: EA program is well-defined, governed, and managed
across the organization enabling and generating measurable busi-
ness outcomes and companywide standards. Project compliance and
executive accountability are the norm. IT collaboration is critical to
achieving business agility and performance objectives. Company has
enterprisewide cloud adoption capability.
4. Quantitative: EA program is both qualitatively and quantitatively
managed. Quantitative objectives are based on the needs of the cus-
tomer, end users, and the organization. EA process and performance
are managed from strategy throughout project implementations.
Company has capability to sense and respond to market demands—a
differentiating capability. Company has complex cloud adoption
capability that encompasses collaborative partnering and innovation
with business partners.
5. Optimized: EA program is advanced and continuously improved to
support current and emerging business models. Analysis of project
data identifies shortfalls or gaps in performance and process
improvements. Company has complex cloud adoption capability
that encompasses on-demand, dynamic business partnering and
innovation.
In theory, the more the discipline of EA is applied throughout your
company (whether small, midsized, or large), the greater the opportu-
nity for positive business impacts and a sustainable cloud adoption
strategy. For instance, organizations that operate in silos have a lower
EA maturity level2 and are more likely to have a lower capacity for cloud
adoption (levels 1 or 2) and smaller business impacts, while enterprise
wide capacity is reflected at levels 3 and above signaling business and IT
alignment of cloud undertakings along with governance and manage-
ment that optimizes the adoption across the entire value network (levels
4 and 5), indicating sustained and larger business impacts.
During this phase of the life cycle, you determine areas to assess to
fully understand your capabilities to succeed with cloud adoption. The
information collected helps derive your target state as well as what is
required to get you to your desired state. Figure 3.3 suggests assessment
areas.

The enterprise cloud capability assessment areas provide the mecha-
nism to make informed decisions in your cloud adoption. Such assess-
ments ensure a common understanding of your organization’s
experiences and business capabilities so that you make informed 
business decisions. A description of the enterprise cloud capability
assessment areas follows:
■Customer and Market Insights are evaluated to determine your capability
to anticipate and respond to demands. This assessment intends to
uncover whether your organization actively seeks to understand market
trends and directions that impact your business and enterprise. Does your
organization proactively seek external viewpoints to improve? Keeping a
pulse on trends and directions allows your organization to choose its
proper path of innovator/leader, fast follower, or an organization that only
pursues paths with historical proven track records.

■Business Innovation is evaluated to determine your innovative talent and
practicing skills base. This is essentially an ideation capability and is
influenced by your business networks and your ability to partner to create
and explore new ideas. Also explored is your process for determining
high-value ideas and transforming them into business solutions.
NOTE
The relationship between UPS and Toshiba provides an example of part-
nering for business innovation. When someone sends in a Toshiba laptop
for repair, the UPS company is actually responsible for the repairs
although this is not a UPS core business competency. The arrangement
stemmed from a business relationship where UPS was warehousing the
laptops while Toshiba had repair locations across the U.S. The agreement
was that Toshiba repair technicians would become a part of UPS. UPS
would thereby cut the mean-time-to-repair (MTTR) cycles by reducing
the need to redistribute laptops to Toshiba locations across the U.S. for
repair. The agreement reportedly saved in transportation and inventory
overhead, and reduced Toshiba’s carbon footprint.3 Your enterprise capa-
bilities and cloud vision should seek to identify partnering to innovate.
■Cloud Sourcing experiences are evaluated to determine your skills and
experiences using external providers to source solutions. This includes
traditional sourcing experiences such as service level agreement (SLA)
creation, contract management, and transfer of services to and from serv-
ice providers. The objective is to learn from what works and what does
not work in your culture in working with vendors and partners.
■Service Orientation and Management are assessed to determine your
familiarity and capability to operate in a service-oriented capacity. Are
you using services and SOA thinking to improve the effectiveness of your
business and IT?
■Enterprise Architecture assessments of your practices include integrated
business and information technology architecture and capability. The key
components assessed are business architecture, information systems archi-
tecture, infrastructure architecture, and governance.
■Metrics must be identified to enable continuous improvement. Metrics
provide a measurable attainable goal and can be used to improve the

61
adoption approach. The objective is to understand what metrics have
been captured in your company to-date and the experience and confi-
dence levels in the organization with measurement programs.
■Organization Readiness assesses your culture and organization readiness
for adoption of cloud. Purchasing patterns are examined to determine
whether there is a culture of objective based decision making in pur-
chases and procuring of services.
■Products and Services are assessed to determine your core competencies
and for tracking delivery of products and services.
Target Architecture and Cloud Enablers
This phase is a reminder that whether you are pursuing cloud adop-
tion now or anticipate adoption in the future, it is a good idea to update
your architecture to include cloud considerations. For example, what are
your business principles for cloud adoption? Such principles represent
durable statements of direction and guide adoption decisions when the
principles have been vetted with the proper stakeholders. How should
you govern in a single or multisource environment, and what are your
standards for conducting business in virtualized environments? Other
examples of cloud considerations are to understand the targeted con-
sumers of your cloud services, their locations, and your potential for new
business. The answers to these types of questions form the basis for a sta-
ble foundation (your architecture) that all business units can reference
and leverage for creating sustained value. It frees your teams to focus on
more business critical initiatives such as innovation and developing
practices to effectively manage cloud service providers, bringing com-
petitive advantages to your organization. If a solid foundation is not in
place, extra work might be required to plug in adopted solutions, which
most likely will cause inefficiencies in your cloud adoption.
You are encouraged to select cloud solutions that are business driven.
Focus on business processes that might be enhanced with cloud comput-
ing, innovated, augmented, or newly formed due to cloud. Your business
drivers and processes are reflected in your business architecture (BA).
Regardless of your target entry point (SaaS, IaaS, and others), your BA
can influence architectural decisions in each of the respective domains to
enable any selected entry point, and it helps you determine requirements

for your cloud providers. If, for instance, your targeted business markets
(reflected in your BA) are of international scale, you should team with
your business and technical teams first, followed by potential providers
to ensure that your networks can handle the added capacity in a secure
manner and that potential cloud solutions are compliant with regional
and corporate regulations.
The following sections provide recommended conceptual considera-
tions and updates to your EA to promote enterprise cloud adoption
readiness and consistency in adoption throughout your company. Three
areas are explored for updates in your enterprise architecture:
■Business Architecture and BPaaS
■Information Systems and SaaS
■Technology & Architecture and PaaS and IaaS
NOTE
High level requirements are depicted in each of the following discussion
topics. These requirements influence cloud adoption decisions and are
inputs into service and operational level agreements generated during the
implementation phases. In addition, the requirements can represent orga-
nizational change (people, process, information, and technology).
Business Architecture (BA) and Business-Process-as-a-
Service (BPaaS)
Now that you understand your business capabilities, and have estab-
lished a vision for cloud adoption in your organization, the next step is
to establish your target BA. This includes your core competencies and
strategic business priorities, as discussed previously, where you leverage
this information to determine key business events, processes, and oppor-
tunities for cloud sourcing. In essence, your BA is a visual, comprehen-
sive representation of your company’s business strategy. It contains all
the information discussed and is a cloud enabler. Figure 3.4 illustrates a
high level, one page view of a BA. There are minor augmentations to BA
when it comes to cloud consumers; however, the role of the business

architect and the use of BA can significantly influence your cloud adop-
tion decisions.
Consider that you decide to use a provider’s platform to support your
SaaS solutions. In this situation, you still need to ensure that the appro-
priate stakeholders (generally reflected in your BA) are able to consume
the appropriate services. You also need to ensure that there is an infor-
mation taxonomy and business information model (described later) that
is shared and understood by your organization and can be discussed with
your provider so that, for instance, a Sales ID that is used on premise
means and is applied as a Sales ID in your cloud environment.
NOTE
A business’s information taxonomy represents a division of a subject into
ordered groups or categories along with the logical relationships between
them. The understanding of the information an enterprise uses is
expressed in a business information model.
If the decision is to adopt one or more on-premise private clouds,
understanding your business events and processes (which are elements of
your BA) is required so that you know your elasticity needs as volumes
are expected to peak as well as hit low points. You are required to com-
municate these business requirements to your providers (in-house in

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
64
this situation) so that they can ensure that the solutions are interopera-
ble, but also to adequately plan to meet your service capacity require-
ments such as when they can expect and plan automated ramp-ups of
server and storage capacity.
Your BA contains information such as business events, stakeholders,
business rules, geographical locations, and policies. For example a busi-
ness policy for key business processes is that there is zero tolerance for
provider inaccessibility and system downtime. These influence your
cloud business requirements and adoption decisions. You should utilize
your BA as a first point of reference in guiding your cloud adoption
decisions regardless of expressed entry points. You should review your
BA, frequently, with key stakeholders so that it continuously evolves as
your business priorities evolve.
In this phase, you establish mechanisms for displaying your BA and
cloud opportunities, and you incorporate decision considerations for out-
sourcing business processes in entirety or in part to cloud. This informa-
tion is captured and reflected as a part of your integrated business and
IT strategy as guidance for cloud implementation planning and develop-
ment initiatives.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture and cloud enablers, business architecture and BPaaS include updat-
ing your BA:
■Document your business competencies: Review and document your
business competencies: abilities, skills, proficiencies, experience, and
expertise. That is, essential capabilities necessary for the success of your
business.
■Identify core business processes and events: Document business
operational locations, business interactions, and actors.
Document the relationship interactions between organizations and busi-
ness functions across the enterprise using a Business Interaction Matrix.
This helps illuminate the value chain across organizational boundaries.
The Business Interaction Matrix shows several key entities and relation-
ships: business services rendered by business function and/or organiza-
tion, dependencies, and business service relationships.
■Capture BPaaS business requirements: Understand which applica-
tions and supporting processes can be replaced with a shift to a vendor-
provided application platform. This requires an understanding of what

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
65
information can be shared and lives in the cloud and business processes
that can operate in the cloud.
■Review and document business agility indicators: Documenting the
agility indicators for a process is necessary in making the decision on
BPaaS. For example, what is the degree of customization required? How
often do regulatory changes occur? What is the impact of loss, data secu-
rity, or non-compliance? Answering these questions helps define the flex-
ibility (i.e., agility) needs of a given function or process.
■Capture your financial strategy: This entails defining acceptable BPaaS
pricing models for your stakeholders.
NOTE
Consumability4 is an example high level cloud business requirements cat-
egory that focuses on end user experiences. You need to ensure that con-
sumability is not overlooked when making decisions on cloud
enablement. Your work artifacts for capturing requirements should
include consumability by addressing ease of use and integration needs.
You should have standardized business requirements work artifacts of
which consumability should be added as a category.
Key work artifacts relative to cloud adoption, target architecture and
cloud enablers, business architecture and BPaaS, include updating your
business architecture with
■Business Interaction Matrix defining a meta-model of key business enti-
ties and their relationships; functional domains, business services, busi-
ness services rendered by functional domains, organizational boundaries,
and the dependencies. Developing this matrix helps in understanding the
value chain where aspects will be BPaaS cloud candidates.
■BPaaS Cloud Adoption Principles reflecting durable statements of direc-
tion when adopting BPaaS. Such principles are vetted with key stake-
holders and are used to refine requirements so that they satisfy satisfy the
principles or suitability of vendor/partner solutions. Principles should
pass a simple test of “so what.” That is, if the principle does not have
impact or cause some debate it may not be a durable statement of IT
direction. The intent of principle development is to avoid statements that

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
66
everyone would agree to; that is, statements that do not cause transforma-
tion or change are not as valuable or impactful as those that do force
change toward strategic goals. Some example cloud adoption principles
are listed in Table 3.2.
■Business requirements for BPaaS, which might address the types of appli-
cations or business processes suitable for BPaaS. Types of applications
might be grouped into processes that are not differentiated; vertical
applications that are self-contained crossing few organizational bound-
aries; standardized process models; or applications with few if any real-
time connectivity requirements. Business information that must be
included is also addressed. Use cases for BPaaS candidates are created
along with corresponding user profiles.
■Agility Metrics, which inventory by process or functional area and gauges
the relevance and necessity of BPaaS. Those gauges could include number
of dynamic business rules, degree of customization, geographical varia-
tions, compliance, or security.
Table 3.2
Example Cloud Adoption Principles
Principles Description
1
Cloud adoption for BPaaS will be used to reinvent business processes while pro-
viding rapid delivery of new services realized without boundaries.
2
Ownership models will be established as cloud portfolios will be governed and
managed by business and IT owners.
3
Workloads will be optimized with cloud adoption to preserve capital by driving
greater efficiency and performance.
4
Standardized processes that require rapid deployment of new infrastructure or
platform must adopt cloud computing.
5
Cloud adoption must comply with regulatory and corporate policies.
6
Applications with unacceptable high costs will be migrated to a cloud support
model.
7
Providers with cloud computing solutions must employ open standards and 
promote business interoperability.
8
Information that will reside in the cloud must be documented in an Information
Model with governing characteristics such as information accountability.
9
Cloud exit strategy must exist for each cloud adoption addressing data segrega-
tion, data privacy, and data security.

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
67
As illustrated in Figure 3.4, Distribution and Business Support and
Management Services represent core business competencies where three
known cloud solutions exist for Marketing, Digital Communications,
and Human Resource Management. This diagram is elaborated in the
next chapter when discussing how to identify cloud candidates.
Although cloud services are illustrated in the example BA artifact, you
should identify a formal structure for capturing your cloud services port-
folio. This portfolio serves as a baseline not only for adoption but also for
management of internal and external clouds. You can use the following
as a cloud services portfolio template to gain consensus within your
organization:
■Cloud service name, which provides a unique identity for each cloud serv-
ice in your portfolio.
■Description of the service enables consumers to understand the capabili-
ties rendered by the service.
■Business purpose describes the expected outcomes when using the cloud
service.
■Service type of BPaaS, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.
■Deployment model of private, public, hybrid, or community cloud.
■Owners who have responsibility for granting access and ensuring the con-
tinued viability of the cloud service.
■Required enablers describing prerequisites for consumers necessary to
leverage or use the cloud service.
■Traceability (optional) shows the business process or component that is
being replaced or augmented with cloud if that is the case; this is useful
for portfolio management.
■Hierarchy (optional) depicts relationships of the cloud to other clouds;
this is useful for workflow orchestration and in composite cloud situa-
tions.
■Vendor-specific requirements capturing capabilities enabled by the cloud
vendor necessary for the service.
■Industry, which shows whether the cloud is associated with a specific
industry.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
68
NOTE
An industry vertical cloud, such as life sciences or healthcare, is often
governed by a set of industry regulations. One such example is the Federal
Drug Administration (FDA), where an example qualification requirement
of providers is verification that the cloud is installed and performs as
intended throughout all anticipated operating ranges. In such cases, pro-
visioning and decommissioning differ from a horizontal cloud where,
since the services are intended for multiple markets or industries, latitude
is given to providers to deploy clouds to your consumer specifications and
without compliance to industry-specific regulations.
Information Systems and SaaS
When it comes to EA, information systems (IS) comprises two architec-
tural aspects: Information Architecture (IA), which can be summed up as
your enterprise’s data, structure, and standards for enablement and adoption;
and the Application Architecture, representing your enterprise’s applications,
structure, and standards for adoption and enablement.
SaaS adoption can augment or replace your IS in part or in its entirety,
and therefore just as business considerations were discussed earlier, this
section discusses information and application considerations for cloud
adoption, which relates to SaaS, as sourcing and enablement options
must be evaluated.
Information Architecture (IA)
Integration of your business and information systems is required to
ensure ongoing value of SaaS investments. With the inception of cloud,
boundaries for information ownership and accountability can become
blurred, and easy access to SaaS services, although convenient, intro-
duces quick yet inadequately planned adoptions that can result in short-
term fixes and an abundance of SaaS solutions that are difficult to
manage. A key to success, therefore, is understanding your information
and recognizing when it makes sense to source information from cloud.
Figure 3.5 presents a summarized list of some information manage-
ment and governance considerations that augment traditional IA, which
in itself is an enabler of cloud. Each high level requirement, information
assurance, information integration, information security, and governance

of information, influences cloud adoption decisions and must be consid-
ered both in the context of your company’s BA and upon the auspices of
enabling growth and/or enhancing profitability through deliberate
analysis of costs, savings, risks, and rewards.

Cloud considerations for SaaS (information and applications)
The following questions help solidify the context of your IA require-
ments and, at the same time, should be leveraged to stimulate conversa-
tions with providers to further refine your requirements and to make
selections as to suitable providers. Chapter 6, “Mitigating Risk,” pro-
vides additional details. Resolve to answer each of the following ques-
tions to solidify your understanding of the requirements for information
architecture in cloud adoption:
1. Information assurance
■What information is required to run your business?
■Can cloud effectively manage your global stream of information?
■Will the adoption of cloud reduce your sales team’s data quality
problems?
■What are the implications if your provider becomes unavailable or
gets acquired by another company?
■What mechanisms are required to prevent the adoption of cloud
from forcing you into counterproductive situations such as you can-
not access your own information, or you are forced to continue work-
ing with a provider once your contract ends?
■What are your cloud backup, retention, and recovery requirements?

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
70
2. Information integration
■How will information seamlessly integrate across cloud and your
company?
■How well will cloud based information models integrate with corpo-
rate information models?
■What patterns are appropriate, self-service, broker, federation, others?
3. Information security
■What are financial implications of information security in the cloud
or lack thereof?
■What are necessary changes (organization, procedures, and policies) to
ensure domestic and global regulatory compliance?
■What information is qualified to enter into the cloud?
■How will information security breaches get resolved?
■Is information restricted to company employees only (single tenancy)
or are multiple companies allowed to view and use information pro-
vided in the cloud (multi-tenancy)?
4. Governance of information
■Who will make decisions relative to cloud adoption and how will
your company communicate, enforce, and address exceptions?
■What are business policies for on- and off-boarding to and from the
cloud?
■Who are information stewards and what are the responsibilities?
■How will you determine what information goes into the cloud?
■Who will own information that resides in the cloud?
■What are required information management and governance tools?
■What is the chain of custody for information in the cloud?
■Given a lack of regulatory or legal guidelines to address data privacy,
how will you ensure local governments or bodies don’t have access to
personal information in the cloud?
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture, and cloud enablers, include updating your IA:
■Create or Update your Business Information Model (BIM): The BIM
contains information to be consumed or shared in the cloud. As your
company adopts cloud you are still accountable for your data but may no
longer be responsible for it. BIM helps in deciding what data should

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
71
reside in the cloud. Such a model contains a framework that outlines how
your company will gather and use information for SaaS adoption and
usage. Data segregation and data security responsibilities should also be
defined.
■Review and update cloud adoption principles. Table 3.2 describes a
set of principles that can be updated to address principles necessary for IA
and SaaS.
■Document high level information requirements: Requirements in
areas of service levels, security, privacy, and other operational needs must
be captured to ensure they are fulfilled with cloud adoption.
■Enhance governance to address information in the cloud:
Information governance must be enhanced to address cloud adoption:
data traceability, managing entitlements and identities for authorized
users, data retention policies, data separation, and chain of custody for
information are examples.
Key artifacts created in this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture and cloud enablers, for Information Architecture include
■Business Information Model (BIM) defining your taxonomy, where taxon-
omy provides a view and structure of your information model. It provides
a conceptual framework for organizing content so it can easily be identi-
fied and located. Taxonomies are typically hierarchical, multilevel, and
show the relationships between concepts of the information model. Table
3.3 lists key characteristics and the process for generating a BIM. Levels 0
and 1 provide the highest level of specificity; these levels are conceptual
in nature and appropriate for strategic planning of information required
for your cloud adoption. Levels 2 and 3 provide lower level specifications
and are most appropriate for project-specific cloud solution planning
where development of logical and physical data models are most appro-
priate. Continuity of business alignment is maintained throughout each
level.
■Cloud Adoption Principles for Information Architecture—SaaS must be
identified and vetted with key stakeholders to guide and prioritize
requirements or cloud adoption decisions. The intent of principle devel-
opment is to define statements of directions that serve to break ties or
guide choices when making decisions about the BIM or SaaS. These prin-
ciples become part of a single set of Cloud Adoption Principles.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
72
■Business requirements for Information Architecture—SaaS can be com-
piled using the answers to the questionnaires listed earlier in this chapter.
Information as a service requirements should be identified.
■Information Governance and Management Strategy addresses the charac-
teristics of governing and managing the BIM in the context of cloud
computing. It should address processes, policies, roles, responsibilities,
metrics and organizational change suggestions, and procedures that are
not represented in your existing IT or EA governance.
Table 3.3
Enterprise Business Information Model Characteristics
Level Specificity Description
0
Conceptual Presents a high level view of information subject areas important to the
business and establishes a foundation from which information designs
can progress. Analysis at this level is required to determine and specify
which information is needed and appropriate for cloud-sourcing.
1
Conceptual Depicts a high level statement of the main entities comprising the busi-
ness subject areas defined in Level 0. Analysis at this level is key to
determining and specifying information appropriate for cloud-sourcing.
2

tions.
3

BIM is derived from BA and represents information intended to be consumed or shared in
the cloud.
A subject area reflects a major classification of information valuable to the enterprise per its
business context.
Application Architecture (AA)
Your company will pursue SaaS not met by your capability to extend
business functionality, address new markets, create business outcomes
faster, or simply to bring solutions to market faster. The benefits of
rapid ROI, reduced up-front investments, global availability, and the
ability to increase efficiency of your IT budget make SaaS an appropriate
course of action.

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
73
It is also possible that you will streamline and preserve in-house
applications in an effort to optimize return on legacy investments. EA
helps as it provides a comprehensive view of your applications, depend-
encies, and the underlying architecture where, in most cases, your appli-
cation portfolio is an integrated landscape of in-house, outsourced and
cloud-sourced solutions.
You need to understand and manage your application portfolio, cloud
included, and one way to do this is to assign ownership and accountabil-
ity from both the business and IT organizations. This comprehensive
view of your applications equips you to make informed and justifiable
decisions relative to SaaS adoption and enabling technologies. Similar to
IA and as is depicted in Figure 3.5, four cloud considerations must be
explored in the context of cloud adoption:
■Application assurance
■Application integration
■Application security
■Governance of applications
Consider the scenario where regulatory stipulations inhibit sharing of
specific company information in public clouds. In this scenario, your IA
provides directives and requirements to reflect that some information
will be sourced from SaaS while proprietary company information must
remain internal. Your AA provides directives and requirements that
reflect the need for standardization and strategic direction as to appro-
priate SaaS purchases, as well as federated security patterns to prevent
end users from signing on to multiple systems to view reports for which
they have no authorization. This scenario emphasizes the need for an
integrated internal, external, and business aligned information systems
architecture to enable cloud computing in a manner that drives value
and sustainable business outcomes.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture and cloud enablers, include updating your AA:
■Create and/or Update the Application Architecture aspects in your
EA: Application types or categories that are suitable for SaaS adoption
should be identified. New applications that can be satisfied through a
SaaS model should be reflected by stating when specific qualities are met.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
74
Those aspects could include shorter deployment time, compliance to
service levels not otherwise achieved in-house, ability to eliminate costs,
and ubiquitous access.
■Review and update cloud adoption principles: Table 3.2 describes a
set of principles that can be updated to address principles necessary for
AA and SaaS.
■Document high level SaaS requirements: Service and operation levels
should be captured and understood when adopting SaaS. Determining
whether application architecture documentation will be maintained rep-
resenting the various layers of the architecture may be a SaaS require-
ment. Understanding APIs available to pull and push data may be a
requirement. Service level agreement requirements must also be defined.
■Enhance governance to address SaaS: Access to applications should be
tracked with audit trails in SaaS models. Secured access to data centers
and application level intrusion detection are of the utmost importance.
Change management, portfolio management, repositories, retention, and
accountability for recovery are some key governance aspects that must be
addressed with SaaS.
Key artifacts created in this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture, and cloud enablers, for Application Architecture include
■Business requirements for Application Architecture—SaaS should be
identified addressing a variety of issues described as follows. AA ques-
tionnaires can also be used to capture requirements.
■
Service level agreements: Requirements, escalation if not ful-
filled, and of course the types of SLAs (e.g., availability and per-
formance)
■
Integration capabilities describing types of application program-
ming interfaces (APIs) that are available for pushing and pulling
data
■
Standards that would be leveraged
■
Security model describing identity management, authentication,
and authorization options
■
Exit strategy

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
75
■Cloud Adoption Principles for Application Architecture—SaaS must be
identified and vetted with key stakeholders to guide and prioritize
requirements or cloud adoption decisions. The intent of principle devel-
opment is to define statements of directions that serve to break ties or
guide choices when making decisions about the types of workloads suit-
able for SaaS. These principles can become part of a single set of princi-
ples as is depicted in Table 3.2. 
■Applications-as-a-Service questionnaires should be developed to aid in
the principle development and the requirements capture. The IA ques-
tionnaire can be used as a template.
■Application Governance and Management Strategy addresses the charac-
teristics of governing and managing the application architecture, SaaS, in
the context of cloud computing. It addresses governance issues not cur-
rently represented in your existing EA governance. Cloud candidates
should surface as an output of the governance activities where specific
workload types or application types might be most suitable for SaaS.
Technology and Infrastructure, PaaS and IaaS
A significant advantage of cloud computing is your ability to free up
IT staff to work on strategic initiatives while nondifferentiating work-
loads are outsourced to cloud. This is effective whether you choose pub-
lic or private cloud settings. In fact, according to a recent
Computerworld report, a primary reason for NASA’s cloud adoption is to
get out of the business of running data centers and focus on its core com-
petencies, which are space exploration.5 The same is applicable to tech-
nology and infrastructure architecture (TA), meaning you can expect
your IT software and hardware expenditures to decline considering that
cloud-sourced services have better pricing and chargeback features, and
you can expect your data centers to shrink in size and energy consump-
tion due to reduced capacity and optimized usage of existing assets such
as servers. With this in mind, your strategy should encompass considera-
tions for leveraging alternative, more cost efficient data centers.
According to The Corporate Executive Board Company,6 there is over-
all acceptance of private clouds in the industry, with the adoption of
public clouds increasing as a natural progression and due to the maturity
of public cloud capabilities. Figure 3.6 shares excerpts of a consumer’s
data center, the home of technology and infrastructure architecture. The

76
example illustrates requirements for Developer (PaaS) and Storage (IaaS)
clouds, and is a reminder that although sourced from a provider, these
services are ultimately the responsibility of the consumer. This requires
service level agreements and integrated service management—both top-
ics are discussed in depth in Chapter 6.

Cloud considerations for technology and infrastructure architecture (excerpts)
NOTE
Keep in mind that at this phase of the life cycle you are not focused on
implementation details, so from an SLA perspective you provide strategic
guidelines, such as who should be involved in contract negotiations,
techniques for SLA creation, and you provide SLA mitigation considera-
tions. As you transition to implementation planning and know which
cloud services are suitable for your specific situation, you provide project-
specific guidance.
Following are core technology and infrastructure components relative
to private cloud adoption that you should consider:

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
77
■Capacity: Organizations should be careful that adequate capacity (e.g.,
servers, storage, licenses) is on-hand to support cloud consumption while
controlling hardware and software spend.
■Cloud Computing Management Platform (CCMP):7 Consult with
your providers regarding their cloud computing management platform.
CCMP defines the operational and business support services commonly
needed for delivering and managing any cloud service. This specific capa-
bility augments traditional EA and SOA environments and is applicable
for public and private cloud adoption.
■Networks: Be aware that operating your cloud from central data centers
and over the WAN can add to latency and degrade cloud performance.
■Virtualization: For manageability, you should standardize on a core set
of virtual images and a common cloud platform.
Referencing Figure 3.6, should your company have a desire to offload
IT workloads to a public cloud, you can eliminate a significant portion
of your physical assets (as depicted) with the exception of usability and
network/connectivity services since these components are required for
both cloud consumption and enablement.
NOTE
Figures 3.4 and 3.6 are deliberate and recommended to discuss strategic
cloud opportunities and explore the implications of decisions, such as the
scenario just described. Detailed designs will evolve as solution architec-
ture and cloud-specific projects emerge.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, target architec-
ture and cloud enablers, include updating your Technology and
Infrastructure relative to PaaS and IaaS:
■Review and update cloud adoption principles: Table 3.2 describes a
set of principles that can be updated to address principles necessary for
PaaS and IaaS. For example, a principle could state that “an exist strategy
must be defined when adopting PaaS and IaaS.”

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
78
■PaaS and IaaS Requirements: Review and document technology and
infrastructure requirements. Include reliability, availability, and service-
ability (RAS) service and operational levels.
■Update your data center strategy: A data center strategy addresses
capacity and cost capabilities necessary for an efficient operation of a data
center. Incorporating data center best practices that include cloud adop-
tion must be included in the strategy.

Gap Analysis and Transition Planning
You have commenced formulating the contents of your strategic
roadmap in prior phases, and at this gap analysis and transition planning
stage (phase 4), your focus is on reviewing, prioritizing, and finalizing
the contents of your roadmap to prepare your organization for cloud
adoption.
Gap analysis helps compare your company’s actual performance with
its potential. Gap analysis provides a foundation for measuring invest-
ment of time, money, and human resources required to execute your
enterprise cloud adoption strategy and is often referenced as shortfall

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
79
analysis. Two common shortfalls when it comes to strategic planning for
cloud adoption are ongoing training of others on how to apply the cloud
adoption strategy and the principles therein across the enterprise and
educating stakeholders on conducting requirements and change manage-
ment in cloud settings. You will find in the scenarios and case studies
that many organizations were mindful to conduct training of team mem-
bers so that they could effectively maintain the cloud adoption.
However, a common omission is managing change and integrating
requirements management processes for cloud solutions. Both activities
are required transition and implementation planning activities.
Transition plans are the required actions to prepare you for change.
Inputs into your transition plans are prioritized shortfalls identified dur-
ing gap analysis as well as information learned from subsequent phase
analysis. As with all the other phases, one of the outcomes of your cloud
adoption strategy is deciding who should be involved in developing your
transition plans. The format of transition plans varies; however, Chapter
7, “Planning the Transition,” provides some examples and discusses the
subject in more depth.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, Gap Analysis
and Transition Planning:
■Perform a gap analysis: Assessing what you do well and where
improvements can be made is essential to a successful cloud adoption.
Table 3.4 provides an example of the results of an assessment.
■Understand change management needs: Sustained success with cloud
is essential to achieving benefits. Often this requires an understanding of
whether organizational changes are needed, education for key stakehold-
ers, or training materials. Often, organizations must seek outside advice
to develop change management recommendations and corresponding
actions.
■Develop your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap: The roadmap
provides an actionable, living plan for how to make your cloud adoption
strategy come to life. Risks must be identified and corresponding actions
taken in the plan to address.
Key artifacts created in this phase of cloud adoption, Gap Analysis
and Transition Planning, include

Table 3.4
Information Stewardship Gaps and Recommendations for Successful Cloud Adoption
Summary of Gaps
Recommendations
Lack of consistent, coherent, and coordinated
governance with span of control across the
organization. Lack of governance at the exec-
utive level.
Establish global governance board with infor-
mation stewards. Realign groups to streamline
governance with span of control that includes
cloud.
Lack of global data quality methodology,
policies, communication procedures, meta-
data, etc.
Establish and enforce global data quality
methodology, policies, metadata, etc.
Lack of enforcement of data quality and pro-
cedures to address issues. Poor control of
data sources. Cloud adoption will exacerbate
this problem.
Set and enforce data quality controls and
measures, improve and certify quality and
integrity of data and management prior to
commencement cloud adoption initiatives.
Publish guidelines for appropriate use of
cloud.
Lack of coordination between governance
bodies and regulatory/audit compliance
processes.
Ensure alignment of common processes
through formalized communication channels
and/or shared membership. Add cloud busi-
ness and technology expertise to the governing
body.
An enterprise governance structure with common methodologies and procedures is lacking;
enterprise information practice is immature; governance boards at the executive level do not
exist.

Implementation Planning
Implementation planning is the final phase. It is derived from the
strategic, prioritized roadmap and is project-specific. Implementation
arrangements are made with providers in this phase and contracts signed
to commence work efforts. Chapter 7 provides detailed discussions on
both transition and implementation planning with practical examples.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption,
Implementation Planning, include
■Define SLAs and select vendors: Defining SLAs and selecting vendors
is a key activity to realize the roadmap. Preparing cloud procurement
plans is performed. Reviewing requirements from prior phases is a key
input for the SLAs. Cloud provider selection occurs as a final task.
■Develop integration requirements: Understanding dependencies and
integration needs as you adopt cloud becomes an input into the planning
process.

82
■Refine your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap: Updating the
Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap occurs based on the actual vendors
and SLAs agreed upon. Updating the plan with reasonable timelines and
identifying key resources are performed.
The key work artifacts relative to this phase of cloud adoption,
Implementation Planning, is the updated/refined Enterprise Cloud
Adoption Roadmap.
Governance
Three areas of governance are addressed in this book, expressly in
Chapter 5, “What About Governance?,” and each incorporates cloud
considerations:
1. Strategic direction: Sets the vision and directs development of the
enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
2. Management and control: Develops and manages execution of the
enterprise cloud adoption strategy; drives and makes updates to EA.
3. Execute: Implements the enterprise cloud adoption strategy and
communicates experiences and lessons learned.
Key activities relative to this phase of cloud adoption, governance,
include
■Develop the governance framework: Establishing stakeholder deci-
sion rights and authority in terms of cloud purchasing and vendor selec-
tion is performed. The communications plans are addressed in this
framework. The cloud decision model described in Chapter 4 will 
be used.
■Create a cloud reference architecture: Updating EA to include a cloud
reference architecture provides guidance to executives, key stakeholders,
or lines of business as to what’s available for cloud adoption in the enter-
prise.
■Refine your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap: Updating the
Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap occurs based on the actual vendors
and SLAs agreed upon. Updating the plan with reasonable timelines and
identifying key resources is performed.

The key work artifacts relative to this phase of cloud adoption,
Implementation Planning, are
■Governance Framework provides the model for implementing governance
for cloud adoption.
■Cloud Reference Architecture, which becomes part of the Enterprise
Architecture. This reference architecture provides the guidance and direc-
tion necessary for teams to successfully adopt cloud in your enterprise.
■Enterprise Cloud Adoption Roadmap that describes the initiatives and
projects necessary for achieving success with cloud adoption.
The Significance of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
If you have incorporated service oriented architecture (SOA) into your
EA program, you are much farther along when it comes to developing
and implementing your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. As you have
seen in this chapter, aspects of EA such as applications or infrastructure
can be sourced in part or in their entirety from cloud in a shared services
(public or private) capacity. If you are familiar with the architectural
style of SOA, you know that shared services are a central theme while
the uniqueness of cloud is the dynamic ability to expand and contract
resources on demand to fulfill shared service requests and meet your
business needs.
Some basic attributes of SOA are embedded in cloud that you should
consider when developing your enterprise cloud adoption strategy:
1. Understand your business processes and use this information to
guide identification of service candidates. You will follow the same
or similar principles to identify cloud candidates. This topic is dis-
cussed in Chapter 4.
2. Reuse and share services across your value net as much as possible in
an effort to reduce costs and optimize return on investments. The
same applies to cloud although sharing is between larger and often
unknown audiences, particularly in the case of public cloud con-
sumption.
3. Establish appropriate business patterns. Some examples are the
extended enterprise, which can be applied to reflect your company’s
representation of a hybrid of internal and external cloud solutions;

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
84
and self-service patterns, which reflect your company’s on-demand
cloud adoption position.
4. Capture your service management requirements. With cloud, the
concept of service management can have even more impact than
with SOA if you consider that you can source core business capabili-
ties from the cloud, and often SLAs, along with strong portfolio
management, are the only indicators that you might have relative to
delivery assurance.
A key point of contemplation when it comes to service management
requirements development and negotiations is the criticality of the serv-
ices that you are cloud-sourcing and the business impacts should your
provider get acquired by another company or if services suddenly
become inaccessible.
5. Determine whether a cloud center of competency is needed in your
organization. Centers of competency provide resources with deeper
skill levels in a subject area. These resources are generally sought to
validate cloud provider capabilities and help determine the business
needs and opportunities for cloud. Some focused skill sets are con-
tract negotiations, product architecture and branding (re-branding
is gaining increasing momentum in the marketplace), cloud subject
matter expertise, and the ability to manage cloud providers.
Standards
Standards are significant since proper use can drive interoperability
and a smoother integration of cloud solutions within existing or target
environments. Some standards are specific to your organization, such as
your billing or integration standards, some are open and commonly used
across industries, and others are specific to cloud providers.
While cloud standards are maturing, it is common to find consumers
that insist on cloud capability that can be exposed through Web Services
or application programming interfaces (APIs) using industry protocols
such as representational state services (REST) or simple object access
(REST) or simple object access protocol protocol (SOAP) so that con-
sumers are not bound to a specific provider. Many consumers, for
instance, have standards that require exposure of cloud services through
their in-house portal. Your flexibility to add new services to your
portfolio irrespective of providers, as well as to remove cloud services in

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
85
a simplistic, self-service manner is enabled by selecting cloud providers
that use open industry standards in addition to ensuring that your in-
house teams apply similar concepts.
Following is a summarized list of standards that you should consider
for cloud adoption—these standards are applicable to each of the life
cycle phases. You will refine this for your specific company needs:
■Corporate policies and standards such as purchasing, chargeback, and
budgetary guidelines.
■Industry-specific and/or regulatory standards such as the U.S. Patriot Act
and the influence of this standard as to where and how your applications
and data will be stored in the cloud. Some international companies, for
instance, are concerned about information residing in U.S. data centers
because the Patriot Act allows the government to monitor data.
■Standards that enable clouds to consume other clouds with identity man-
agement, such as identify federation.
■Standards that promote front-office, back-office, and companywide cloud
integration, such as SOA and open APIs.
■Standards that promote simplified, cost affordable movement of applica-
tions and data into and out of the cloud, such as open transport protocols.
■Standards that drive security and privacy of your assets, such as audits
and assurances, so that once you provision cloud services (for example,
virtual machines) your assets are protected, including from your originat-
ing provider.
■Service level agreement and operational (SLA/SLO) standards.
■Standards that drive cloud portability so that you can use one provider’s
platform today and another’s tomorrow such as Open Virtualization
Format (OVF).
Summary
Following a life cycle of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
ensures investments in cloud are meaningful and positively impact your
organization. This chapter described the life cycle and provided some
practical examples of how to realize the life cycle. The chapter also high-
lighted the significance of augmenting traditional EA (your integrated

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
86
business and IT strategy) with cloud considerations. If you do not incor-
porate cloud into your EA, your cloud adoption principles, policies, and
procedures will become nonstandardized, which will add to a complex,
inflexible environment, and issues with a rogue, cluttered, inconsistent
cloud adoption might surface. Worse, the benefits of cloud computing
will not be fulfilled.
EA encourages you to make holistic cloud adoption decisions that
examine both horizontal—across business units—as well as vertical—
business process specific—considerations so that you make informed
cloud business decisions. EA domains are examined for relevancy and to
guide effective integration and enablement of cloud. A high level map-
ping of cloud delivery models and EA is provided in more detail than in
the previous chapter to demonstrate the interconnectivity of EA and
cloud. Business domain defines the processes and standards by which
your business operates. The information systems perspective defines and
classifies data (structured and unstructured), applications, and the stan-
dards that your organization requires for adoption and enablement of
business solutions. The technology/infrastructure domain defines the
hardware, software, and networking requirements. Examination of each
is required to determine best-fit cloud opportunities and ensure devel-
opment of a sustainable enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
Leverage enterprise architects who drive consistency when it comes to
cloud activities and in the development and use of business, technical,
and security strategies. In addition to your cloud architects and subject
matter experts, leverage the skills of business architects. Business and
enterprise architects are accustomed to taking advisory roles and guid-
ing business technology adoption and usage decisions. If you have
adopted SOA, you are accustomed to applying cloud adoption princi-
ples, such as shared services and reliance on service providers for busi-
ness capability. You most likely experienced best practices and lessons
learned that you carry forward into your cloud adoption strategy, such as
balancing legacy and sourced solutions. You appreciate that cloud is a
complementary consumption and delivery model to SOA, which is not a
delivery model but rather an architectural style or solution pattern.
Cloud standards bodies are emerging so instead of providing a
comprehensive list of organizations, incorporated in this chapter are
some key areas of standardization that you might consider as a cloud
consumer and expect from your providers. Examples are portability and

3: The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy
87
interoperability. Following are some standards organizations or consor-
tiums that you may find useful to add to your strategy where in the
majority of cases you will consult with your providers on relevance and
feasibility. You will modify this list to align with your organizational
needs:
■Cloud Standards Customer Council (CSCC): An end user advocacy
group dedicated to accelerating cloud’s successful adoption, and drilling
down into the standards, security and interoperability issues surrounding
the transition to the cloud. A focus is prioritizing key interoperability
issues such as cloud management, reference architecture, hybrid clouds,
as well as security and compliance issues.8
■Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF): DMTF’s cloud efforts
are focused on standardizing interactions between cloud environments by
developing specifications that deliver architectural semantics and imple-
mentation details to achieve interoperable cloud management between
service providers and their consumers and developers.9
■National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): NIST is a
nonregulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce.
NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitive-
ness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in
ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.10
■The Open Group (cloud work group): The Open Group is a vendor-
neutral and technology-neutral international consortium, whose vision of
boundaryless information flow enables access to integrated information,
within and among enterprises, based on open standards and global inter-
operability. The cloud work group focuses specifically on the develop-
ment and application of open cloud standards.11
■TM Forum: TM Forum is a global industry association focused on sim-
plifying the complexity of running a service provider’s business; the
Cloud Services Initiative (CSI) recognizes that as buyers start to look at
using cloud services there are a number of barriers to adoption. The pri-
mary objective of CSI, one of many initiatives, is to help industries over-
come these barriers and assist in the growth of a vibrant commercial
marketplace for cloud based services.12

The integrated business and IT leadership team along with Sharon, the cloud
business consultant, agreed to focus on strategic business objectives and address
challenges facing advancement of Distributors, Inc., business strategy as an
approach to how cloud adoption could advance their company. This approach
could eventually lead to new business models for Distributors, Inc., new markets
for selling their products, workforce transformation for their sales force, or simply
offloading significant portions of IT workloads, the original business require-
ment. Sharon’s objective is to ensure that she helps create business outcomes that
matter for Distributors, Inc., by targeting strategic business imperatives. She
noticed business agility is often mentioned as part of the strategy as Distributors,
Inc., dealt with globalization and an increasing uncertainty in their industry.
The business competencies and initial focus areas are product development and
distribution, particularly order fulfillment where business performance was reported
as good, and customer management where business performance was reported as on
the decline. One indicator of declining business performance was the poor quality of
information disseminated to individuals in recognition of purchases that they did
not make. Examples include special promotions, e-mail campaigns, and other digital
communications.

Sharon learned that Distributors utilizes SaaS in both product development
and distribution areas, but no one really understood the process for managing
application portfolios and vendor relationships. Sharon was not surprised to find
that spreadsheets were utilized to record changes in customer information—a con-
venient yet costly business practice due to inefficiency in manual processes, the rate
of errors, and information integrity issues.
Using the company’s business architecture, which was composed with the help
of the enterprise architect, Sharon provided a visual depiction of cloud candidates
as circled in Figure 4.1.
Your Cloud Decision Model
How do you go about identifying opportunities for cloud adoption?
Several approaches are available. One approach is to apply top-down
analysis, where you rely on your business architecture to guide cloud
investment considerations. The following sections examine both top-
down and bottom-up analysis approaches. Both approaches can use a
cloud discovery workshop, which is also illustrated.

Top-Down Analysis
A top-down approach is applied when you are not clear on how to
proceed determining how cloud will fit in your organization or you want
to drive the decision based on business process needs. This approach
guides Business Process-as-a-Service (BPaaS) and Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS) solutions that will also influence technology and infrastructure
related cloud- and non-cloud-based decisions. During this process, the
focus is not on assessing cloud solutions in the marketplace or providers;
instead, the focus is on how cloud adoption advances your business strat-
egy and fulfills business requirements.
Four steps are involved in top-down analysis, as illustrated in Figure
4.2 and described in the following sections.
Step 1—Understand Your Company’s Business Vision and
Strategy
The strategy may center on becoming number one in a market, cap-
turing a new market, or simply increasing earning per share. Translating
market opportunities into new customers might be the goal. Or the
vision might be to be known for game-changing products and innova-
tions. The key is to look for strategic targets as a result of the strategy or
vision. Understanding your company’s business vision and strategy
requires understanding the following:
■Vision and/or mission in the form of mission or vision statements or goals
■Strategic directives, the imperatives described or stated by c-suite 
executives

92
■Strategic targets, whether they be quantitative and/or qualitative goals
■Product and marketing strategy
■Activities and actions in the form of strategic projects or a roadmap
Armed with this understanding, you will see opportunities for lever-
aging cloud computing emerge. Opportunities that are transforma-
tional, that fuel innovation, or that move your company from
incremental change to business outcomes that make a difference should
be sought and explored for cloud adoption.
Step 2—Know Your Business Competencies and Components
Understand your business competencies and your performance in each
competency. Examples of business competencies are depicted in Figure
4.1: product development, distribution, and business support services.
Business competencies are a grouping of business components, a catego-
rization. Competencies refer to capabilities, abilities, skills, proficien-
cies, and expertise for a defined category such as distribution.
Competencies are defined as large business areas with characteristic skills
and capabilities, for example, product development or supply chain.
Business components are part of an enterprise that has the potential
or ability to operate independently. This means the business component
has enough of its own resources and/or business services supplied from
the outside to be able to produce its own outcomes. Examples in Figure
4.1 are order fulfillment or customer management.
For each business component the goal is to determine whether this
component is a differentiated or nondifferentiated component.
Nondifferentiated components become easy targets for cloud adoption
where sourcing through the cloud might be the preferred option.
Differentiated components provide a unique competitive advantage for
the company, and cloud adoption must therefore fuel innovation in that
component.
Step 3—Understand Sourcing Options (Decision Parameters)
Understanding the sourcing options for the business component helps in
making strategic cost-reduction opportunities by accelerating the right
sourcing decisions. For example, a business component like product develop-
ment might be an internal capability but not best of breed so partnering
might offer significant improvements, perhaps with BPaaS or SaaS. Utility

4: Identifying Cloud Candidates
93
components are ripe for PaaS or IaaS as they might operate on specific service
level agreements and variable pricing. Other components might be strategic,
where the business sees its future and where the business strives for best in
class performance. Others might invest in cloud as a platform for ideation
and innovation purposes. Examples could be the use of Big Data with cloud
as the enabling capability through SaaS, Paas, or IaaS.
With a business outcomes approach and a value-oriented mindset, you
need to determine whether an entire competency or key business services
should be considered for cloud-sourcing. Decision parameters are value-
centric as explained in the following list:
■Business demand: There is a business need for considering cloud adop-
tion. You may be experiencing business growth or you have projected
functional demands where cloud-sourcing appears to be a better alterna-
tive for you to remain operable and/or competitive. You may be experi-
encing pain points such as invalid dissemination of information to
customers as was the case with Distributors, Inc. Whatever the case, your
business needs help you identify the scope and impact of the cloud oppor-
tunity, for example, an entire business unit/competency or business
processes, while the remaining parameters influence your decisions rela-
tive to candidate choices and investment viability.
■Constraints: Constraints control the extent of cloud adoption or prevent
cloud-sourcing altogether. Example constraints are as follows:
■Security and compliance: The adoption of cloud must be in compliance
with security and regulatory requirements. Highly regulated environ-
ments generally (but not always) influence private cloud consumption
patterns.
■Information sensitivity: Information sensitivity and intellectual
property requirements can influence your decision toward private cloud
consumption.
■Business infrastructure restrictions: You may have legacy assets or
special business processing requirements that simply cannot be replaced
with cloud consumption, or your data is frankly “too big” to deploy into
a cloud environment without causing adverse impacts on performance.
While this is not the norm, it is a growing reality.
■Extensibility: There is high probability that the adoption will extend
across other business units, which simplifies your asset portfolio, reduces
redundancies through reuse, and enables your business platform with
agility and manageability.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
94
■Financial advantage: Total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on
investment (ROI) in cloud adoption is commonly better than traditional
IT investments and outsourcing; there are demonstrable profitability
indicators with the adoption of cloud.
■Internal capacity: You are experiencing internal capacity issues, for
example, employee turnover and shortfalls that require business technol-
ogy augmentation.
■Outsourced or managed services: There are outsourcing and/or man-
aged services potential, an indicator of an opportunity for, at a minimum,
private cloud adoption. With cloud, the adoption process is faster, con-
tracts are generally shorter, and there are self-service, menu style choices
that offset traditional software licensing and other expenditures.
It is feasible to partner with IT outsourcing service providers as they
move toward augmenting existing capabilities with cloud.1 If your
providers have not discussed this option with you, you should initiate the
conversation. If you are working with an in-house managed service
provider, you have greater control of whether to offload capabilities to
cloud. Teaming with outsourced and managed service providers makes a
good deal of sense considering that you have pre-established business
relationships and as long as any new services and innovations add value
and no downtimes to current operations (steps 1 to 4).
■Strategic advantage: The opportunity is a business differentiator for you
with respect to end user services, it improves business operations, and/or
it adds innovative market capability; the enablement required to support
the adoption is marginal compared to anticipated rewards.
■Other: This parameter is optional and reserved for special business con-
siderations. Some examples are industry-specific, such as advancement of
remote healthcare and safety, or smarter city values such as traffic and
energy efficiencies, which might be of particular interest to you if for
instance you are in an overly populated city.
Step 4—Prioritize Your Cloud Candidates
You prioritize cloud candidates based on the importance of adoption
to your business. Enablers must be taken into consideration when prior-
itizing candidate cloud services. Enablers are components required to
support the adoption of cloud services that you are considering. An
example enablement candidate is governance and in the Distributors
scenario an example is Information Technology (IT).

4: Identifying Cloud Candidates
95
There is no calculation to determine priority; however, each parame-
ter is weighed according to your level of importance and based on the
business impacts. Your prioritized candidates become a part of your
roadmap, which is discussed in Chapter 7, “Planning the Transition.”
Bottom-Up Analysis
A bottom-up approach occurs when buying decisions are IT focused
and the solution has immediate impacts on your technology and infra-
structure in the form of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-
a-Service (PaaS). Consider the following: The IT department expresses
performance-related issues with current technologies and is interested in
cloud to improve service levels, commencing with IT infrastructure, the
bottom of the cloud “stack” as was described in Chapter 1, “Business
Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy.” Referencing Figure 4.2, the candi-
date identification process starts at step 3 where decision parameters are
applied. Recall the example from the previous chapter in which 
Figure 3.6 illustrated both storage and development cloud service candi-
dates along with usability services and network connectivity as enablers.
A difference in this bottom-up approach compared to top-down is
that you evaluate your technology domains first to determine cloud
opportunities. Again, since you are focused on business technologies, the
cloud opportunities must add value and therefore must be traceable to
your BA—a common oversight in many cloud adoption pursuits today.
Here are some situations where bottom-up analysis might be applied for
public and private cloud scenarios:
■Organization has little or no IT staff so you leverage externally provided
cloud services to streamline IT asset purchases, configuration, and man-
agement expenditures.
■Data center is nearing physical capacity so you reach out to cloud
providers for augmented networking and data center efficiencies.
■Leverage cloud for mission critical services, such as high performance
computing, business intelligence, Big Data, application/Web hosting,
integration, disaster recovery, storage and retrieval, or security services
that are unavailable in-house.
■Leverage cloud as a platform for IT research and innovation.
■Reseller of cloud services looking to start with IT services as your early
entry point into the marketplace.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
96
■Aging or legacy environment can be replaced with cloud solutions with
minimized risk and managed change to current operations.
■Take advantage of cloud virtualization principles for development, test-
ing, and collaboration so that you can keep up with rapid, technology-
agnostic change cases.
Cloud Discovery Workshop
Both top-down and bottom-up analysis might benefit from doing a
discovery workshop with key business and IT stakeholders, armed with
an understanding of the business vision and strategy, to uncover cloud
adoption opportunities. This workshop is described in Figure 4.3.

cloud value proposition for business and IT where the focus is on moti-
vation. Next suitability is determined as to whether, based on business
value drivers, opportunities exist to apply cloud thinking. When a pos-
sible fit is determined, entry points are discussed to determine initial
steps for creating value. Next readiness is understood so that appropriate
change management activities can be undertaken. Finally the value case
is described with a focus on creating a roadmap where the value case
could be any of the following:
■Increase visibility on process execution status and related business object
through better integration, activity monitoring, and so on
■Reduce unwanted variety, enforce policy compliance, and closely audit
execution
■Cut structural costs to work within new levels of granularity and better
quality—process variation support
■Hide internal complexity to simplify business operations and unwanted
side effects (ease of doing changes)
■Reduce transaction costs to enable new interaction channels (sales and
supplier side)
■Increase ability to be more robust against supply and demand variability
■Innovate business model for entering new value nets
■Lower transaction costs and simplify business boundaries to open up new
sourcing options for production and products
The goal of the workshop is to result in cloud adoption opportunities
that deliver a quantum leap within 6–12 months for business outcomes
that realize the vision and strategy. Relevant key performance indicators
are identified with a corresponding cloud solution that becomes part of
the roadmap all enabled by cloud capabilities mapped to strategy goals.
Business Scenario: Cloud Decision Analysis for
Distributors, Inc.
Considering the good performance of the order fulfillment, one might
ask “why consider cloud-sourcing or cloud adoption as an enabler for
that business area? Why not just leave well enough alone and focus on
customer management where performance was reported as problematic?”

That is like asking Apple, “Why don’t you stop building new products,
especially after experiencing global success in sales and innovation with
the releases of the iPod”—that seems so long ago—“and as of late the
iPad and iCloud?” Well that is unlikely, but what is notable about the
company’s strategy is its ability to market to everyday consumers and
gain strong corporate adoption of solutions not directly but through
those very same consumers.
In Distributors’ case, the team actively pursued enterprise-class order
fulfillment functionality that would support anticipated business
growth due to new product offerings soon to be introduced to the mar-
ket. The required functionality and services presented a compelling
business case for cloud adoption in comparison to traditional “packaged”
solutions.
Sharon saw additional advantages of cloud adoption that would bene-
fit the global sales team. The idea was that a cloud-based order fulfill-
ment system that is accessible over the Internet would prevent
downtimes that normally arise when Distributors’ internal network
becomes geographically inaccessible. In such cases, information is col-
lected on local devices and spreadsheets to be uploaded once systems
become accessible. This approach presented challenges to technology
teams responsible for maintaining what they expressed as “senseless data
repositories.”
So, while current financial and service performance was good, there
were uncertainties of the current environment’s business and technical
capacity to keep pace with emerging product offerings and the com-
pany’s global strategy.
Customer management is a business service area that was notably
degrading in performance due to poor in-house customer service and
support. The impacts were lost customers, declining sales, wasted spend,
and not so positive press. The entire customer management competency
was categorized as eligible for business process outsourcing (BPO) using
traditional paradigms; the team soon agreed that it was advantageous to
consider business process outsourcing to cloud (BPaaS), which by default
included offloading IT associated workloads.
Several SaaS solutions were already in use for marketing, digital com-
munications, and human resource management (HRM). The concern was
redundancy and again unnecessary spending. For example, one of the
marketing providers printed brochures and was paid a premium price for

4: Identifying Cloud Candidates
99
such services, and the CIO questioned the value of such services. Sharon
and her team proposed to streamline the amount of SaaS applications to
a common business solution where feasibly possible. Portfolio manage-
ment and improved processes for cloud purchases were highly recom-
mended, and instead of paying premium dollar for print services, the
team suggested a focus on green business where such efficiencies would
become a part of the company brand. Limited HRM capability was pro-
vided by a SaaS provider on a trial basis; since the team was pleased with
initial performance Sharon proposed adoption of the provider’s HRIS
(Human Resource Information System) cloud.
By default, this top-down approach enabled the team to identify
opportunities to offload business and IT workloads in a structured and
cohesive manner with manageable business risks and continuity.
Furthermore, just as the BA was reviewed for candidate BPO opportuni-
ties, technical architectural components were reviewed to determine
business impacts and associated candidates. This approach is more
strategically focused and value centric than Distributors’ original, emo-
tional suggestions, which were to offload IT workloads only and without
analysis or conducting the proper due diligence.
As mentioned, portfolio management was an issue, but there was also
an issue with misaligned business and IT budgets. The net effect and
pain point was either ad-hoc reprioritization of IT initiatives to support
unplanned business needs or projects were waitlisted causing high frus-
tration levels for all teams involved. This course correction was essential
for a successful transition to cloud and required governance for contin-
ued operations once new processes were introduced. Figure 4.4 provides
a visual illustration of the proposed change, which was to move away
from silo to integrated business principles. The left represents the cur-
rent state where decisions were top down and technology and infrastruc-
ture teams were not allowed to collaborate with end users. On the right
is the proposed change where decisions would be made collectively and
business and technology teams are empowered to collaborate with end
users. The infrastructure team would also operate as a service organiza-
tion as opposed to current mannerisms, which were unresponsive to
technology team requests and lacked accountability for poor perform-
ance since the technology teams faced the business when issues that were
infrastructure related emerged.

Summary
This chapter described techniques for identifying cloud candidates as
viable solution alternatives and the significance of creating a cloud deci-
sion model as an essential element of your enterprise cloud adoption
strategy. You were introduced to top-down and bottom-up approaches to
identifying cloud candidates and enablers that were supported with real
business scenarios and experiences, and considerations for integrating
cloud with managed services and traditional outsourcing were discussed.
Often, you might experience situations where business and IT teams
are misaligned, but as in the case study depicted, there can be issues in
alignment of IT teams and project accountability. In the Distributors
case study, which is supported by Figure 4.4, the technology and infra-
structure teams operated in silos. In fact, the technology team was fre-
quently blamed by the business units for issues that were infrastructure
team-related. The decision to move to cloud was a viable choice, but
development of an enterprise cloud adoption strategy encourages stake-
holders to look broader and deeper into enablement requirements such as
transition planning and governance. In this case, the proposal encom-
passed recommendations for the infrastructure team to operate as a serv-
ice organization and provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as depicted on
the lower right of Figure 4.4. This approach would rectify poor business
behaviors and influence more collaborative, proactive decision making
between the technology and infrastructure teams with appropriate levels
of accountability when it comes to addressing business problems. The

approach also supports the company’s cloud adoption strategy. Both
transition planning and governance are discussed in upcoming chapters.
You might also hear the expression or an expressed desire for teams to
look “up” the stack when considering cloud adoption. This is usually due
to an emphasis on quick wins or solving immediate pain points without
enough emphasis on business process optimization and efficiencies that
can have more impact on the organization. Up the stack is therefore
where priority is placed on business processes (BPaaS or SaaS) while
“down” the stack is when the priority is placed on infrastructure (IaaS or
PaaS). Both are suitable when applied in the right context and when you
consider your enterprise architecture as was discussed in this chapter.
You can apply the techniques discussed in this chapter to all aspects
of cloud decision-making, including application and information sourc-
ing as a strategic and precursory activity to cloud provider selection.

This chapter describes some business essentials for enabling governance in an
enterprise where cloud is a part of the organizational landscape. Included are
new and expanded responsibilities; some guiding principles that should be consid-
ered when integrating cloud into your enterprise using enterprise architecture
principles as a foundation, practical considerations for developing your enterprise
cloud governance framework, strategies for governing in the presence of outsourc-
ing, and evolving paradigms such as governing cloud service brokers and organi-
zational innovation. A key outcome of this chapter is insights and added
capabilities for communicating the business value of developing and governing
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.

Governance Is Essential for Cloud
Governance is critical to the success of your cloud adoption strategy.
You have to think about external forces and the business value that your
adoption will bring to your enterprise, and you have to ensure that your
adoption fits within your existing environment (business processes,
applications, information, infrastructure, standards, and interfaces).
Governance is the difference between a successful and sustained adop-
tion where benefits become realized contrasted to a fragmented imple-
mentation where cloud adoption makes minimal impact to your strategy
and business outcomes.
Example governance considerations include the following:
■Determining how decisions are made relative to cloud adoption, for
example, your current review process for business technology adoption
should be updated to include cloud and the appropriate subject matter
experts
■Determining who in the business owns cloud solutions and ensuring that
ownership responsibilities are adequately defined
■Determining who will authorize release of funds for cloud investments
■Authorizing final decision-makers relative to cloud adoption
■Establishing accountability and policies for changing cloud business
decisions
This chapter provides practical considerations for enabling gover-
nance in an enterprise where cloud is a part of the organizational 
landscape. Because cloud solutions often involve outsourcing, this chap-
ter also provides guidance for governing in the presence of outsourcing.
Governance can be perceived as an extra (and sometimes unnecessary),
but skipping this step often results in poor decision making or none at
all, which can lead to wasted time and effort along with unacceptable

5: What About Governance?
105
qualities of service. Essentially, without governance your cloud projects
can turn into a mess before they ever get started simply because no one
is aware of your strategy or of the necessary roles, responsibilities, or
authority levels required for a successful transition to cloud. You proba-
bly have experienced situations where no one knows what to do or stake-
holders are reluctant to make decisions because they feel that decisions
will get overwritten. These are all indicators of little or no enterprise
governance.
In their book Enterprise Architecture as Strategy, Ross et al. describe IT
governance as “specifying the decision rights and accountability frame-
work to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT.”1 You can apply
that same principle to EA governance as “specifying the decision rights
and accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the use
of EA.” Now take that definition a step further and apply to this book
where governance is “specifying the decision rights and accountability
framework to encourage desirable behavior in the use of EA for effective
adoption of cloud computing.”
Management is the execution of governance and that management by
itself is not governance. So while governance is about deriving decision
rights, making decisions, and establishing accountability, management
is the action or execution of the decision. Both are required and are more
effective when integrated.
An Enterprise Cloud Governance Framework
A critical success factor of governance is to not only manage the
impacts of cloud on the business (described in previous chapters), but
you must also govern the use of cloud. If you have defined your EA, you
most likely have defined how it will be governed, for example, through
the use of a governance framework where accountability controls are
established to ensure appropriate adoption and use of your EA. If that is
the case, your next step is to incorporate cloud governance considera-
tions as illustrated in Figure 5.1.

Excerpts of an enterprise cloud governance framework. Ideation is added as recognition
that innovation is fueled by all stakeholders irrespective of their positions within a company.
If you have not developed a governance framework, you can reference
Figure 5.1 as a starting point since some cloud-specific considerations
are incorporated. In either case, you should expand and build out the
framework to support your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. Here are
five core framework components:
■Principles and policies
■Organization
■Financials
■Processes
■Metrics and tools
Principles and Policies
Principles and policies are your business rules and laws for cloud
adoption. A principle is a statement of belief that serves as a foundation

5: What About Governance?
107
for establishing decision making policies, while a policy defines the
underlying rules that an organization has to use when making cloud
adoption decisions. Policies are normally defined at the strategy level.
Some examples are decisions relative to cloud provider selection—for
example, who is on and off limits, contract restrictions, required service
management processes, and specification of enterprise applications and
data that are suitable for placement in the cloud. Policies prescribe man-
agement direction to guide your organization in meeting its stated busi-
ness needs and objectives, to ensure the business conforms to prescribed
legislation, to demonstrate management commitment, and to clearly
define responsibilities. For example, you might have a policy around
data encryption or data separation that must be true for private, public,
hybrid, and community clouds.
Policies are normally defined at an overall strategy level and can be
related to a specific area, for example, security policies or management
policies. In many instances, policies reflect the law and givens, which
must be adhered to—this is especially true in the case of security and
privacy policies. Guidelines may also exist that are general statements of
direction, a desired future state that is not necessarily mandated.
Guideline statements are similar in content to principle statements but
without the associated motivation and benefit statements. Your gover-
nance model needs to reflect the mix of principles, policies, and guide-
lines for IT services whether provided by your internal data center or
private/public cloud. Cloud governance requires management of policies
given the complex relationships between user groups, cloud providers,
and consumers.
Organizational Structure
Organizational structure depicts the leadership and key roles, respon-
sibilities, and levels of accountability that must exist for effective deci-
sion making relative to your cloud adoption. An example is
establishment of an executive steering committee (ESC) that authorizes
and approves cloud purchases and an architecture review board (ARB)
that determines the effectiveness of integrating cloud into your environ-
ment. These teams are critical toward building, executing, and integrat-
ing cloud into your enterprise.
Governance is particularly useful when day-to-day operations are
pressing because of the temptation to simply get the job done—
whatever it takes—and the adoption of cloud does not remove these 

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
108
tendencies. In a properly governed environment, however, the right
decisions are made, clearly communicated, and readily adaptable to both
strategic and tactical situations.
A few roles and responsibilities mentioned in the diagram are worth
elaborating on as there are additions to traditional EA responsibilities
with the adoption of cloud, while Appendix A, “Augmenting Your
Delivery Model with Cloud,” provides more information on cloud actors
and their specific roles and responsibilities. Ideation is discussed in the
upcoming section, “Governing Innovation.”
The chief enterprise architect must be able to communicate with the
most senior executives the value of cloud and the advantages of develop-
ing and executing your strategy without going into the intricacies of
infrastructure and cloud implementation details. You can expect that
senior executives are looking for more than the typical responses such as
cloud will allow you to stand up an environment faster than your enter-
prise IT organization. They are looking for the value and impacts of
cloud adoption on the business, and they are looking for opportunities
to positively impact the bottom line for an extended period of time.
This responsibility is significant for both small and large enterprises
that, for instance, might be interested in expanding their market share,
or they might be on the verge of adoption but are wavering because of
publicized outage experiences. Your chief enterprise architect might in
turn suggest innovative strategies such as the use of aggregated cloud
provider partnering to ensure that should a primary provider’s service
become unavailable, partner services are executed so that service levels
and your end user experiences remain in tact.
If you are an enterprise architect, it is highly recommended that you
obtain cloud business skills at a minimum and be able to guide deci-
sions. You will be faced with situations such as service management ask-
ing about the guidelines for commissioning and decommissioning cloud
environments in your organization. Traditionally, this would not be the
case; however, because there is a potential to offload key dimensions of
your EA to cloud—for example, you can offload a significant majority of
your infrastructure components and services—you need the skills to
drive the right business decisions that ensure interoperability across
your organization and the various lines of business.
The cloud architect was added to the ARB. The skills and talents of
this role from a business and technology perspective should not be over-
looked. As the South African case study demonstrates in Appendix B,

5: What About Governance?
109
“Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions,” a significant problem was
over provisioning cloud environments, which caused more harm than
good (the client was initially unable to reap the full benefits of their
cloud undertakings due to excess maintenance of virtual environments).
The role of the cloud architect can help standardize virtualization strate-
gies and related business efficiencies.
Included is the user experience architect, which is a crucial role for
determining the appropriate service interfaces to be presented to end
users and consumers of cloud services. Many consumers, for example,
require their own portal to remain the entry point for cloud consump-
tion, which implies that provider services are accessible through the use
of application programming interfaces (APIs) or Web services. The
review board should also include a test and security architect, and both
must be adapted to support enterprise integration of cloud solutions
through development of test strategies and establishment of adequate
processes, procedures, and tools that help validate that any proposals for
cloud adoption are secured so that risks for vulnerabilities are mitigated.
NOTE
Security is not a check mark but rather a fundamental part of your
enterprise cloud adoption strategy. The sooner we become aware of and
start considering security requirements in cloud decision making the less
likely projects will experience costly downstream project or vendor
related issues once the move to cloud commences. Often, the perception is
that addressing security should occur during technical solution discus-
sions, and that the conversation should be led solely by the security team.
During a recent life sciences project, the exploration workshop was com-
prised of business and technology executives and line of business leaders
who willingly discussed business security objectives as they contemplated
the use of public clouds for fixed content such as e-mail attachments
along with backup and recovery of medical image data.
Some organizations have formed a Cloud Center of Competency (CoC)
that is comprised of resources with deep cloud business and technology
skills. This might not be required for organizations that are purely
interested in public cloud consumption. But if private “on-premise”
cloud consumption is a part of your strategy, then deeper skills are

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
110
required. You should also expect that a CoC or similar organization
exists within your cloud provider’s domain and consider this a part of
your provider selection criteria in areas such as product viability.
Significant responsibilities at the strategic level are listed and include
the following:
■Approve strategic roadmaps.
■Advocate compliance and security.
■Advocate cloud partner relationships.
The executive steering committee company approves and contributes
to development of strategic roadmaps ensuring that budget and funding
activities are given priority and that roadmaps are aligned with the over-
arching vision of the company. In fact, the more engaged executive spon-
sorship is during development of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
(typically conducted by a dedicated strategy team) the better, since a key
outcome is a strategic cloud roadmap, and because the same stakeholders
that comprise your strategy team might very well become members of
your executive steering committee.
As depicted, the executive steering committee is an advocate and
speaker regarding the necessity of compliance with industry regulations
as well as corporate policies, and they speak to the validity of establish-
ing partner relationships in advance leveraging their networks to facili-
tate the process. Each of the responsibilities described is critical and
should not be omitted given the direct impacts on service excellence.
The responsibilities at the management and control layer, particularly
of the architecture review board include
■Managing/evolving and defining strategic roadmaps.
■Monitoring compliance.
■Defining standards and policies.
■Establishing and managing cloud partner relations—which traditionally
resided at the execution (the next layer) of EA—requires focus prior to
execution.
■Integrating service management processes.
The architecture review board is comprised of business and IT leader-
ship and encompasses architects and subject experts or specialists.

5: What About Governance?
111
Working closely with both steering committees and solution delivery
teams, the review board manages and controls cloud adoption within the
organization ensuring that your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
evolves and remains relevant as your business climate evolves. For
instance, if you commenced your cloud adoption journey as a consumer
of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions and you evolve your business to
become a value added reseller (VAR) of SaaS services, your enterprise
cloud adoption strategy must reflect this vision and the path for reach-
ing your desired state.
The board sets corporate standards, and they are aware of industry
standards and the necessary steps for compliance. The team also man-
ages, communicates, and might establish cloud partner relationships in
an effort to influence downstream selection of cloud providers for effec-
tive cloud solution delivery. Another key responsibility is to establish
integrated service management processes, for example, change and
release management procedures for adopting and integrating cloud solu-
tions across your company.
The solution delivery team is responsible for executing your enter-
prise cloud adoption strategy and applying the standards on specific
projects. The communication flow is both downstream for specific proj-
ects and upstream as feedback to the review board and the executive
steering committee typically in the form of practical experiences and les-
sons learned. Executive steering committee responsibilities include
ensuring that projects:
■Comply and implement.
■Manage and establish cloud partner relations.
■Integrate service management policies and principles.
Delivery experiences, where best practices are captured as part of your
EA, keep your enterprise cloud adoption strategy viable and relevant 
as they comply and implement standards, policies, and principles on
cloud projects. The team is ultimately responsible for cloud provider
selection and managing relationships for the good of the projects they
support. The team might establish cloud partner relationships leverag-
ing suggested partners from the ESC and review board, and they inte-
grate and implement service management policies and principles across
provider channels for delivery excellence.

112
Financials
Financial governance is incorporated into the framework and should
not be new to traditional EA governance frameworks. Financial gover-
nance is a key influencer of cloud adoption and business technologies as
a whole. It involves financial stewardship, development of funding mod-
els, financial management, and establishment of acceptable business
cases for cloud investments.
Financial management may appear less complex for cloud due to the
pay per use pricing model and also due to the bundling of services,
which at a minimum reduces the amount of contracts that your organi-
zation is required to manage, but be prepared for a hybrid environment
of traditional and cloud based services and contracts—at least initially.
How will cloud services be governed, for instance, so that you manage
renewals and only continue subscriptions that add value to the business?
Revenues generated due to the benefits of cloud adoption are an
example financial area that should be governed. Considering that the
transition to cloud helps organizations improve services to customers
(and business units in the case of private adoption) through, for exam-
ple, faster time to value and reduced costs since support staff is stream-
lined or no longer required to manage issues with client downloads and
server access issues, your cloud adoption strategy might involve budget-
ing for and reallocating earned revenues for strategic and related corpo-
rate imperatives such as the establishment of executive training
programs that enable employees to more effectively oversee and govern
cloud service providers. Financial governance, in this example, ensures
that your monetary objectives are identified and carried forward through
stakeholder accountability, budget allocations, auditing of financial
activities, tracking of earned revenues and expenditures, and appropria-
tion of funds that are associated with cloud adoption.
It is important to measure the financial viability and impacts of your
adoption choices on your organization from both a short- and long-term
perspective. This subject is covered further in Chapter 8, “Financial
Considerations.”
Processes
Governance of the cloud environment forces you to make concrete require-
ments as to what governance procedures your cloud provider must have in
place, or define a collaborative governance process where you peek into

5: What About Governance?
113
their environment to see if processes are executed appropriately. The most
effective governance model for you, the consumer, is going to be collabora-
tive governance since you are interested in consuming the cloud versus day
to day running of the cloud—which is the responsibility of the
provider....With respect to governing your EA with the inception of
cloud...management processes may change but your decision framework,
which is what governance is all about, should be neutral to sourcing.
Claus Jensen, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM
Governance processes fall within four main categories, as listed here
and illustrated in Figure 5.2:

Management processes
Management processes ensure executive involvement and oversight of
your cloud adoption strategy and execution. Risk management is not a
new addition to governance processes, but it is emphasized as a focus
point when considering cloud adoption and should be addressed as early
as possible during strategy development and considered throughout
every phase of your enterprise cloud adoption life cycle. Additions to
management processes are establishing responsibility and contract
accountability; service management requires more integrated principles
(to be discussed in Chapter 6, “Mitigating Risk”). Then, there is per-
formance management. Some key questions that stakeholders will
address relative to performance management are

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
114
■Where are the opportunities to improve your business performance?
■Where should you allocate IT resources to support your enterprise cloud
adoption strategy?
■Which non differentiating activities should be considered for cloud-
sourcing?
■When is it appropriate to cloud-source your core business applications?
■Who will update your EA so that cloud adoption and enablement pat-
terns are standardized?
Each of the identified processes can be more difficult to establish and
maintain in a cloud setting because you have no real visibility into
provider operations, and as such joint development of contracts, service
level agreements (SLAs), explicit service requirements such as identify-
ing when and how you want to be notified when an SLA is in jeopardy in
addition to business controls are of the essence and will mitigate busi-
ness risk.
Vitality processes ensure that your adoption strategy is maintained
and communicated as your organization evolves and new business and IT
components are incorporated into your EA. An example vitality process
is standards definition. Standards are specifications that are authorita-
tive and valuable. Standards are what your organization perceives as
valuable and chooses to adhere to in an effort to facilitate business per-
formance. As mentioned in the previous section, “Organizational
Structure,” the execution of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy by
your SD team is an example measurement of its vitality.
Compliance processes define a structured approach to review and
approve cloud adoption decisions. These processes include formal
reviews at key control points prior to and during project implementa-
tions. The ability and convenience of expensing IT capability monthly
using a cloud business model might allow a business unit to bring in
new technology without giving the IT staff and other leaders the oppor-
tunity to vet solutions for reuse or to make sure any candidate cloud
choices comply with your enterprise security standards and policies for
governing information.
Another example compliance process is exception handling and
appeals. Exception handling is crucial in the management of risk and
complexity as well as the tracking of cloud and other business technolo-
gies. Regulatory and industry-specific compliance policies and processes

5: What About Governance?
115
must be addressed sooner rather than later in your decision cycle such as
the implications of data privacy on your decision to adopt public, pri-
vate, and/or hybrid clouds. Your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
should contain compliance processes for your common business scenarios
and serve as a reference point for those seeking direction on compliance
procedures.
Good exception handling is a necessity for ensuring that your strategy is
flexible and valuable if applied appropriately. It does not change with the
introduction of cloud in the enterprise; however, it is recommended that
cloud subject matter experts are a part of the exception and appeals process so
that requests are interpreted appropriately. Caution should be taken to
approve exceptions that are justifiable so that the exception handling process
does not get misused and requests approved by default whereby the process
loses its value. The exception handling process is usually initiated by a proj-
ect manager making a request for an exception.
Communication processes ensure that all stakeholders stay informed
about your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
Metrics and Tools
Metrics and tools enable you to effectively govern, manage, and mon-
itor the performance of local and extended environments that now incor-
porate cloud; this is an essential component in your governance
framework. Metrics ensure that the processes are being properly con-
trolled and are delivering the desired results.
At a minimum, your metrics must have strong correlation with
desired goals, be collectable in a consistent manner, and be collected
without much overhead. You should include factors for selecting metrics
such as frequency of data collection, frequency of reporting, recipients of
the metrics, and tools.
Example tools (which are not limited to metrics) are those that sup-
port information collection (e.g., cloud portfolio and application inven-
tory), metrics databases, and dashboards that include enablement of
self-service entrance to and exit from the cloud with traceability, online
training, billing and metering, application development (if applicable
you will decide whether you want to invest in-house or cloud-source),
quality assurance (QA) and testing, benchmarking, and communication
tools. Cloud consumers need assurance that security and privacy policies
are consistently applied; therefore, processes and tools are needed to

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
116
monitor and report compliance or violation of security or privacy poli-
cies in remote clouds. Your governance framework will identify the
appropriate sets of tools for managing cloud data and environments
internal and external to your organization.
TIP
While we recommend each of the types of tools mentioned, I have found
that the most commonly overlooked items are the QA and testing tools,
particularly on the consumer’s side because of the black box approach to
cloud adoption. In addition to metrics, test strategy examples, QA guide-
lines, and suggestions for testing tools are highly recommended as a part
of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy to validate your metrics and to
govern the adoption of viable cloud solutions and integrated service man-
agement.
Key to your metrics and monitoring capability is the use of perform-
ance dashboards that allow you to anticipate as well as monitor progres-
sion of your organization. For example: What percentage of your
organization is leveraging your learning effectiveness system that is
powered by cloud for executive leadership advancement? Once learning
initiatives are completed, are your leaders performing better, the same,
or worse on the job? Considering this same example and more specific to
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy, you can more effectively antici-
pate who will and should be able to use both your performance dash-
board and your learning effectiveness systems if they are consumable in
the cloud.
Establishing Ownership
Considering that enterprises are becoming more complex due to a mixture
of in-house and externally provided services that must be governed and man-
aged, it is important to discuss ownership and some associated impediments.
In this context, ownership refers to accountability for the successful adoption
and governance of your enterprise where cloud is a part of the solution strat-
egy. The following are three key elements:

5: What About Governance?
117
■Executive ownership: Too often, executive sponsors are counted on 
for financial support alone. While financial backing is expected,
expressed ownership and supportive actions are just as critical and
expected from all sponsors and stakeholders. This includes development
of project management staff so that they learn to manage cloud projects
more effectively and active participation in workshops, interviews, and
information exchanges that drive cloud decisions. Keep in mind that
when employees and customers see this executive endorsement, they are
more subject to adhere to any organizational changes introduced as a
result of adoption.
NOTE
Here are some experienced issues related to executive ownership that you
should consider and hopefully resolve as a part of your enterprise cloud
adoption strategy, and certainly before commencement of cloud pur-
chases:
■Executives are inaccessible and appear to support initiatives in
name only.
■Executives need to balance time accordingly for low-value items
and high-value projects and prioritization.
■Decisions are not made in decision forums such as steering com-
mittee meetings.
■The outward demonstration of favored initiatives regardless of
the value.
■Business unit ownership: Business owners are typically line of business
leaders accountable for the business outcomes of the services and manage-
ment of the portfolios. They are an integral part of the cloud selection,
ownership of the cloud portfolio, and service level requirements determi-
nation and agreement processes. Business leaders should work closely
with IT leaders to make cloud adoption decisions. This, of course, means
decision processes require flexibility and business agility so that innova-
tion and feedback loops are welcomed. Contract management is expected
and usually owned by business units but requires technical leadership.

■Information Technology (IT) ownership: Addresses operations of the
services and required interfaces with cloud providers. IT teams play an
integral part in establishing cloud adoption and integration requirements
and provide practical guidance in the establishment of service level
requirements. IT co-owns adopted cloud solutions and services along
with business units, and they may very well own or co-own the responsi-
bility of governing cloud solution providers.
Governing in the Presence of Outsourcing
Because it is possible that you or your cloud provider might incorpo-
rate traditional outsourcing or out-tasking to fulfill service level agree-
ments, it is pertinent to discuss the notion of governance in the presence
of outsourcing.
Outsourcing is the process of subcontracting to a third party where
the relationship or partnership is strategic and generally of a longer
duration than out-tasking. Out-tasking occurs for small scale tasks and
for shorter durations. Because of the task centricity, resource pools are
used to address business needs that are sourced from various providers,
whereas with outsourcing you have a common provider. Cloud-sourcing
consists of both outsourcing and out-tasking workloads to cloud for
automated, transactional-based services, whereas with outsourcing and
out-tasking, automation might not be a part of the equation and there-
fore efforts remain manual.
If you have outsourced some of your operations and you now choose to
cloud-source others, be mindful that in the traditional outsourced set-
ting you will have more access to people, services are usually not shared
by other customers (e.g., multi-tenancy), and, in many cases, customized
outcomes are easier to accommodate because you own the resources that
are performing the services. That is not the same as in a cloud-sourced
situation where services are digitized and environments are shared with
other customers. You do not own the resources conducting the services
for you (private clouds are an exception), and there is less opportunity to
customize due to standardized offerings. Here are some key messages
relative to governing in the presence of outsourcing:
■Protect proprietary information (including information shared with you
by outsourced providers, such as their rates, key business processes, and

5: What About Governance?
119
work artifacts) and ensure that intellectual property rights and clauses are
established that clearly specify who owns any project outcomes.
■Do not expect the same types of contracts (outsourcing contracts are gen-
erally fixed while cloud contracts are typically variable).
■Outsourced services might require more vendor contact through the use
of call centers, for example, whereas cloud providers are likely to be
anonymous with more self-service capabilities.
■In an outsourced setting, you own your assets although you might tem-
porarily transfer ownership of your data center, for instance, to your
provider, whereas with cloud, you subscribe to and rent assets and at a
said period of time you determine whether to renew or discontinue use of
the rented assets. Both occurrences (owned and borrowed asset models)
must be governed accordingly.
■Know whether your provider is using outsourcing or out-tasking services
and factor this in during the selection process. For instance, if your
provider uses global resources and that is unacceptable due to regulatory
requirements, you should execute your rights to either move on to
another provider or if your provider can accommodate your conditions—
for example, they will source staff from a designated country and citizen-
ship—then you should explicitly stipulate your requirements and your
expectations regarding accountability and noncompliance.
■As with outsourcing, governance of provider relationships in addition to
contracts are important, and complacency in this area can be costly for
organizations. Consider the following Virginia business scenario and
implications: a massive $2 billion computer upgrade outsourcing
arrangement was reported as so troubled that core government services
were disrupted yet there were concerns that canceling the contract early
could cost the state as much as $400 million and leave no one to manage
its computer systems.
The report cited that a prison was left without inbound phone service for
hours; the Virginia State Police lost Internet access for more than three
days; and computers in DMV offices crashed. It was cited that a “convo-
luted” governance structure that involved the use of an independent
board led to confusion and a need for clarity as to who governed vendor
relationships, who had legal accountability for deliverables and service
outcomes, what should have happened when a service agreement was not
met, and who spoke on behalf of state agencies to the outsourcer.2

Governing Cloud Service Brokers
You read about governing the inception of cloud in your organization
and the significance of governing your enterprise cloud adoption strat-
egy. In the upcoming Chapter 6, you will review an example checklist
for selecting cloud providers in an effort to reduce business risks associ-
ated with inadequate provider selection and adverse impacts such as lost
customers and top-line revenue declines. As a part of your enterprise
cloud adoption strategy, you might consider when and where the role of
the cloud service broker (CSB) is applicable. Stakeholders might, for
instance, require assistance in determining the best fit cloud solutions,
or you might seek guidance on how to optimize the value of any previ-
ous or planned cloud investments. Considering your needs and the vast
array of cloud services that are available and continue to emerge, the use
of CSBs might be appropriate and beneficial to your cause.
CSBs are trusted advisors that act on your behalf and as an intermedi-
ary with originating cloud service providers. Although the responsibili-
ties can be carried out by your internal staff (and systems), CSBs, are
typically third-party consultants whose responsibilities are to manage a
network of providers on behalf of your organization. When selecting
CSBs, you should choose those that are capable and credible when it
comes to end-to-end integration of selected services with existing enter-
prise business processes, systems, data, and security in multi-sourced sit-
uations. This means that your CSB is able to link the various types of
providers together so that business performance remains solid and any
issues are resolved efficiently and without service disruption. As the
opening case study pointed out, if you do not clearly define the roles and
responsibilities of your broker (or agent) with adequate governance that
includes performance checks and balances, you might experience unde-
sirable and unexpected consequences.
Clearly defined expectations are essential to an effective governance
program and your ability to measure your CSB’s performance. Listed are
some key decision categories and example expectations that you should
include as a part of your CSB evaluation and selection process:
■Decide the business purpose for introducing CSBs into your organization.
Ask yourself what the business need is and what the CSB offers to meet
your business need that you might not be able to effectively provide 
for yourself. A trigger for many organizations that leverage CSBs is 

5: What About Governance?
121
management of multisourced IT business models where solutions are
sourced from cloud, outsourced providers, and other venues. An experi-
enced CSB will simplify the management complexities of multiple 
service providers, and they can provide a single point of contact and
accountability. If you do not have clarity as to the business purpose, how
can you effectively govern and manage your CSB’s performance?
■Determine how you want to leverage CSBs and what specific services
they will provide. You might for instance require them to provide and
maintain a common catalog of applications or services from independent
service providers (ISVs) to ease the shopping experience of your end users,
and to save time and effort on your part in storefront management and
cloud service aggregation.
NOTE
We have experienced the interlock of CSBs and ISV SaaS services with
both small and large enterprises, particularly in the telecommunications
industry. In such situations it is common for CSBs to pass on SLAs for the
cloud services it receives from ISVs to clients. Most ISVs provide SLAs of
99.9 percent, some 99.5 percent, and some may not provide SLAs at all;
therefore, it is important that you govern and manage all expectations of
your providers and your CSBs specific to cloud delivery and SLAs.
Here are some additional examples of how to explicitly quantify and set
expectations of your CSBs: You decide to leverage your CSBs to interview
and offer suggestions for cloud provider selection or you decide that the sole
purpose of your CSB is to design, develop, and orchestrate the integration of
on-premise systems and off-premise cloud solutions. In addition to commu-
nicating your expectations, you appoint a governing body that oversees the
relationship, monitors CSB performance, and promptly addresses deviations
so that business impacts are marginalized.
■Determine what decision rights and levels of authority you want to place
in your CSBs hands considering that their primary responsibility is to act
as a proxy on your behalf for a scope of work and for a predetermined
period of time. For instance your CSB can interview and communicate
with potential cloud service providers on behalf of your organization, and
they can recommend selection of providers with an understanding that
the actual adoption decisions are to be made by you and your team.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
122
■Establish viable pricing strategies for CSB services and be sure to specify
that the pricing model depends on the role and responsibilities of
selected CSBs. As an example, if your CSB is to operate as a partner and
its responsibility is to ensure that your cloud investments are profitable,
you might create a consumption based plan where CSBs receive a per-
centage of the profits that are directly tied to your cloud investments.
This example pricing strategy encourages and rewards your CSBs as they
partner with you to grow your business. You might apply similar pricing
strategies for CSBs that operate as an aggregator of services from numer-
ous providers. Your governing responsibility is to ensure that there is
stakeholder accountability for developing and enforcing viable pricing
strategies for your company. You will learn of other pricing strategies and
techniques as you read upcoming chapters.
■As mentioned in earlier chapters, companies are creating storefronts or
what can be described as “AppStores” where services are distributed
through a marketplace for a controlled service portfolio offering and more
significantly an efficiently managed end-user browsing and shopping
experience. Since the concept of governing AppStores might be applica-
ble to you, here are six (6) key considerations:
1.
Ensure that the best fit applications are provided through your
AppStore. Success criteria should be quality (since you ultimately
are endorsing the applications) and value-add to your organization
through internal and external users.
2.
Ensure that your AppStore continuously evolves so that appropriate
solutions are offered to your customers. Application of business ana-
lytics and sentiment analysis can be an invaluable tool for capturing
marketing insights and operational metrics. If you are working with
business partners or ISVs, they should provide such capability so
that the right products are presented to the right groups of cus-
tomers.
3.
Unlike some AppStores where applications are restricted to a spe-
cific device type, your AppStore should be accessible from anywhere
and contain solutions that are consumable through Web interfaces
so that you simplify your end-user’s shopping experience.
4.
Your AppStore capability needs to respond to inquiries and reported
problems with service excellence. You should continuously govern
this process. Metrics such as recurring revenues, expenses, and client
satisfaction are key to your AppStore use and its sustainability.

5: What About Governance?
123
5.
Establish a product distribution strategy and billing model with a
focus on how you will integrate the AppStore into your existing
distribution processes. Govern how fast and efficient it is to inte-
grate new and upgraded services into your AppStore with corrective
alternatives.
6.
Ensure that you market the customer experience and business capa-
bility versus marketing cloud. Market the customer experience such
as a quick purchasing and billing processes. Market the business
capability such as accelerated time to delivery of goods and services.
Key to governance is tracking and managing the cost of doing busi-
ness, the time it takes to integrate new services, and the rate of cus-
tomer growth.
You can find more on the subject of AppStores in Appendix C, “More
on Cloud Business Trends.”
Governing Innovation
Technology, to be sure, is only a part of America’s innovation story, but it
is a critical one.
John Kao, Innovation Nation
Executives are taking advantage of cloud adoption for competitive
and strategic advantages such as business model diversification and
emergence into new and existing markets with the rapid introduction of
products and/or services that stem from improved, cloud enabled busi-
ness processes. Cloud ideation should therefore be encouraged and
invited from business as well as IT stakeholders of all ranks within your
organization and your partner channels.
At the core of governing innovation is propelling (not stifling) ideas
and actions forward that drive value internal and external to your organ-
ization. However, all too often governance within enterprises is per-
ceived as a set of rules and bylaws that have been established by a select
body of individuals that might not welcome creativity or the associated
changes unless the ideas are initiated by that same body of governors.
That being said, here are some questions for you:

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
124
■Have you asked your employees and business partners for their ideas on
how to take advantage of cloud to drive enterprise innovation?
■As ideas come forward, who listens and how are decisions made as to sub-
mitter responses?
■If no ideas emerge, have you asked yourself why, and are you effectively
addressing the matter?
■Who is accountable and what are criteria for approving and evolving
ideas from concepts to business innovations?
■Who decides which rewards are appropriate?
Google is one of numerous companies known for innovation. Google
has a reputation for inviting and listening to ideas brought forward
under the auspices that any employee can come up with the next break-
through. Most notable is the “20 percent time”3 rule where employees
are allowed to work on what they’re really passionate about for 20 per-
cent of the time to spark new business innovations. A good example of a
business outcome is the company’s response to the Japan tsunami that
reportedly prompted many “Googlers” to devote their “20-percent time”
to crafting Digital Age tools for handling the crisis.4
Cloud-based mobile applications are recent innovations offered by
numerous companies that are gaining momentum. These applications
can scale beyond the capabilities of most smart phones because you are
no longer bound to the processing and storage capacity of mobile
devices. IBM’s business process simulator CityOne5 is another example
innovation powered by the convergence of gaming, social media, and
cloud.
When it comes to governing innovation you need to establish a con-
structive measurement system so that you reward appropriately. While
this may vary per organization, the following are some measurements
that can be weighted and rewarded based on the value system that has
been established for your organization:
■Strategic impact: There are value centric business impacts such as new
or improved business processes.
■Financial impact: There are bottom line impacts that include cost take-
outs and improved earnings potential at a local and global scale.
■Asset reusability: There is demonstrable reuse potential across your
company and clients.

5: What About Governance?
125
■Client satisfaction: Both internal and external clients will benefit from
the innovation.
■Collaboration: The innovation was developed in a collaborative, 
co-creative manner.
■Image: The innovation adds favorably to your company’s reputation.
The following business scenario was derived from practical experi-
ences. The scenario furthers some of the governance topics covered in
this chapter and shares some lessons learned from the experience.
Business Scenario: Innovation and Cloud Provider
Company
Innovation Inc., was new to the cloud experience. The company had a
little more than 50,000 employees with a business strategy as simple as
to be known in the market as a cloud consumer, while the strategic
vision was to become a cloud provider in the future. The CEO of
Innovation often expressed to stakeholders that the reputation and expe-
riences that the company would gain as a cloud consumer would add to
Innovation’s potential for success as a cloud provider. The goal was to
start small and outsource infrastructure components to cloud, followed
by platform and some applications. Innovation hired a Cloud Provider
Company whom they had conducted business with for years in a consult-
ing and traditional outsourcing capacity. The agreement was that the
Cloud Provider Company would provide consulting services initially
and then become a cloud service provider or broker depending on the
outcomes of the initial assignment and decisions that were made regard-
ing cloud adoption.
The CIO at Innovation (David) met with the CIO (Sandy) and the
enterprise architect (Adam) from Cloud Provider Company and commu-
nicated the vision and that Innovation was not sure which cloud services
to adopt and required consulting expertise to determine the best solu-
tions and approach. Innovation suggested a starting point of
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) because both storage and disaster
recovery services had been discussed, and preliminary executive
approvals were obtained. Cloud Provider Company agreed to the terms.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
126
Though there was mild contention in the beginning due to financial
issues (Innovation wanted to extend a prior outsourcing contract
between Cloud Provider Company to take advantage of the fixed pricing
model), Cloud Provider Company convincingly encouraged use of a sep-
arate contract specifically for cloud consulting services.
Upon commencement of the engagement, the first thing that Adam
required from Cloud Provider Company was the need to firm the scope
of the engagement, define a governance framework, and derive an
approach for understanding market requirements so that any cloud deci-
sions were beneficial to Innovation’s end users. Unfortunately, Adam was
unable to converse with the David after the project commenced due to
David’s unavailability, so Adam searched industry analyst reports and
competitor Web sites to understand specific industry demands that
might be applicable to Innovation’s situation.
A chief technology officer (CTO) from Innovation, unfamiliar to
Sandy, sent an e-mail to her requesting a project kickoff as soon as possi-
ble. Sandy scheduled meetings to plan the kickoff and the engagement
approach, but each time the meeting was rescheduled due to internal
issues at Innovation, causing project delays of three weeks. Sandy esca-
lated the issue to the executive steering committee at Cloud Provider
Company complaining that she was unable to tell who from Innovation
is responsible for what.
After describing the situation to the executive steering committee, both
governance and management were identified as top issues on the
Innovation account. At that point, the joint teams met and agreed to the
following immediate steps to guide decision making and to move the team
forward. The governance framework is depicted alphabetically commenc-
ing with the financial component. As decisions were made and roles and
responsibilities were qualified, the governance framework became more
complete and was carried forward into an engagement model and formal
project plan:
■Financials:
■
Appoint financial steward.
■
Assess financial impacts.
■
Appoint business case lead.
■
Determine cloud procurement team.
■
Develop funding model.

5: What About Governance?
127
■Metrics and Tools:
■
Appoint metrics lead.
■
Establish key business value measurements and metrics.
■
Determine dashboard, reporting, and enterprise infrastructure
and management requirements, including tools.
■
Determine QA strategy.
■Organization:
■
Appoint executive committee lead.
■
Appoint program management office (PMO) lead and form
PMO.
■
Appoint cloud business requirements lead and formalize require-
ments processes.
■
Establish and appoint team members and key contacts from
Innovation and Cloud Provider Company to participate in
reviews with Innovation business stakeholders and product
development teams to understand cloud opportunities and busi-
ness impacts.
■
Establish and appoint Innovation’s architect to partner with
Cloud Provider Company’s enterprise architect.
■
Establish and appoint strategic roadmap development leader.
■
Establish joint executive sponsorship and review cadence.
■Principles, Policies:
■
Appoint policy lead.
■
Determine information privacy classifications.
■
Review corporate policies for regulatory, multitenancy, and busi-
ness development requirements.
■
Establish cloud adoption principles and policies.
■Processes:
■
Appoint process lead.
■
Develop a cloud portfolio management process and strategy.
■
Establish cadence for risk and mitigation reviews.
■
Establish service management strategy.
■
Establish joint executive reviews and cadence with communica-
tion plans.
■
Conduct joint agreement of cloud candidates and prioritization
to occur between both companies.
■
Conduct joint planning of project kickoff.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
128
■
Plan reviews of cloud-specific roles and responsibilities.
■
Review business and technical architecture (from existing EA),
including security to assess cloud opportunities and enablement
requirements.
Over a short period of time, each of the items in this framework was
addressed, and the team was able to develop a formal engagement plan.
The impact of governance was not the development of the plan; the
impact was that business decisions were made, accountabilities were
established, and management processes were put in place to ensure that
the decision framework evolved and was executed. The team was able to
later launch a project kickoff and move forward with refinements and
execution of the plan. In this example, Cloud Provider Company pro-
vides an example of effective governance where issues were escalated to
decision-making authorities and appropriate actions taken; while
Innovation provides an example of poor governance.
Summary
This chapter described practical considerations for enabling gover-
nance in an enterprise where cloud is a part of the organizational land-
scape. We addressed new and expanded responsibilities introduced as a
result of cloud and some guiding principles that should be considered
for integrating cloud into your enterprise. Understanding the signifi-
cance of governance and your executive stakeholders’ ability to describe
the value of governing your enterprise cloud adoption strategy will add
to its longevity and reuse across business units. Senior stakeholders
should regularly ask how proposed cloud decisions and associated proj-
ects would leverage and impact your EA, and along with senior cloud
architects they should engage enterprise architects in evaluations, brain-
storming, and cloud decision making. While the roles of the user experi-
ence and test architects are not new, responsibilities are expanded to
support cloud adoption, and the importance of addressing security con-
siderations during cloud exploration sessions and decision making dis-
cussions are stressed.
This chapter is a reminder that it is important to govern your busi-
ness contracts and finances by appointing financial stewards. This
appointment helps ensure that funding and appropriation of funds are in
order and governed by qualified individuals. Governance of financials

129
also involves traceability of cloud investments to the rightful business
and IT owners.
Because cloud solutions often involve outsourcing, provided is guid-
ance for governing in the presence of outsourcing where the need for set-
ting clear direction and SLAs for externally provided services are
emphasized. As with outsourcing and as was discussed in Chapter 4,
“Identifying Cloud Candidates,” cloud adoption out of frustration with
IT suggests that course corrections are in order to prevent any underly-
ing issues from adversely influencing your strategy and cloud adoption
decision making. An example might be establishing an integrated busi-
ness and IT governance framework that integrates with your enterprise
architecture as was depicted in Figure 5.1 or if you recall from Chapter
4, the course corrections were alignment of business and IT budgets and
empowerment of technology and infrastructure teams to converse with
end users.
You might choose to leverage the services of Cloud Service Brokers
(CSBs), and should that be the case, vendor management, communica-
tions, and relationship accountability are all instrumental to your suc-
cess. Example decision categories were described for your CSB
evaluation and selection processes:
1. Decide the business purpose for engaging CSBs.
2. Determine how you want to leverage CSBs and what specific serv-
ices they will provide.
3. Determine what decision rights and levels of authority you want to
place in your CSB’s hands considering that their primary responsi-
bility is to act as a proxy on your behalf for a scope of work and for a
predetermined period of time.
4. Establish viable pricing strategies for CSB services and specify that
the pricing model will depend on the role and responsibilities deter-
mined for your CSB.
When it comes to governing innovation, enterprises are faced with
establishing budgets and a capacity for research, development, commer-
cialization, learning from failures, and rewarding innovations. Example
cloud innovations were provided with a focused discussion on the objec-
tives of governance, which is to propel (and not stifle) ideation from 
all enterprise stakeholders while a board of governors is appropriate to
evaluate ideas and determine the level of innovation and the submitters’

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
130
eligibility for rewards. Some evaluation criteria for rewarding innovators
was shared along with the importance of validating the usefulness of
ideas to consumers when assessing the business impacts, which is a key
criterion for promoting an idea to a business innovation.
NOTE
If there is no marketability, then an idea may be a good one, but it is not
a business innovation.
A business scenario—Innovation and Cloud Provider Company—
described the impacts of poor governance and the excess churn and
unnecessary costs to the Innovation Company due to indecisiveness and a
duplication of roles, responsibilities, and effort. Good governance was
demonstrated by Cloud Provider Company, which led to effective deci-
sion making and enabled business operations to move forward.
When it comes to governing your enterprise cloud adoption strategy,
what matters most is enabling the right people, processes, information,
and technologies to obtain the appropriate levels of accountability and
oversight so that effective decisions are made at the right time by the
right parties. Effective governance and management ensures that the
execution of your strategy is successful and enduring. Recall that man-
agement is the action or execution of decisions that are made and might
very well change as your enterprise cloud adoption strategy changes.
Some key management processes were outlined and elaborated through-
out the chapter. Governance, on the other hand, is your decision frame-
work, which will change less often than management. It is about who
makes decisions and their decision rights. Both governance and manage-
ment are most effective when applied together.
The next chapter covers techniques for mitigating risks associated
with cloud adoption.

If you invest in a volatile business, then you are cast as being “risky.” If you
apply for a mortgage after a recent bankruptcy, you are considered “high risk.” If
you are a “low risk” investor, then you probably prefer bonds over stocks. Most
people would agree that risk is “The impact of an event factored with its proba-
bility of occurrence” where the impact is either favorable or unfavorable. This
chapter focuses on mitigating the occurrence and the business impacts of unfavor-
able cloud adoption experiences in your company.
Cloud Risk Management and Response Strategies
A small Internet-based retailer named Retail Stores, Inc., is going
through a particularly eventful time of year and decides to leverage an
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider to supplement its in-house
Web hosting capability during peak times. The sourcing decision and
use of a public cloud service provider falls under the accountability of
the IT department. Although the provider is responsible for delivering
IaaS services, the situation is risky for Retail Stores as it is investing and
reliant on external resources for a key business capability. Additional
133

risks are present since Retail Stores is accountable for delivering a qual-
ity performing Web site with positive user experiences irrespective of
the sourcing strategy. Retail Stores, Inc., has at least five risks to man-
age. First, the system quality of service attributes may not meet the
needs of its users; this might be in terms of response time, availability,
or elasticity to meet the needs of peak demands. A second risk is
whether the system meets the needs for recovery in case of a disaster.
Security is the third risk and not because cloud computing is insecure,
but Retail Stores, Inc., must ensure its end-to-end security model and/or
policies are still in force when moving to the cloud model. Determining
whether the return on investment will be achieved is the fourth risk that
must be assessed. Finally, the fifth risk, insignificant business impacts,
involves assessing the suitability of the cloud model in the context of the
Retail Stores, Inc., organization, and of course the use of pilots, and a
focus on IT transformation, helps reduce this risk.
Risks are present in any solution where another organization provides
service delivery for a consumer or subscriber. In the case of cloud com-
puting, this is a unique risk as cloud is inherently transactional. For
example, a cloud provider might refund the fees paid for a service in the
event of an outage, but perhaps not proportional to the business impact;
a refund of IaaS fees might add up to $1,000 for a service whose outage
resulted in $40,000 dollars in lost sales. If you compare this transac-
tional-based business model with most traditional outsourcing
situations you will find that traditional outsourcers are not transactional
based and would have service level agreement (SLA) penalties that are
more directly related to the business impact of the outage. Retail Stores
needs to weigh the balance between possible negative outcomes with the
benefit of taking the risk of subscribing to this service.
Risk response planning is an aspect of managing risk. Responses are
derived based on anticipated adverse effects of risk or opportunities pre-
sented as a result of an occurrence. The following are some example risk
response strategies and example cloud applications.
Risk mitigation involves taking some kind of compensating control
when a particular risk is probable or after an occurrence to reduce the
business impact. Mitigation is typically applied to eliminate or reduce
the chances of the occurrence. Here are some examples:
■You may choose to work with a cloud provider that you have worked
with in the past to mitigate the risk of cost overruns due to a longer proj-
ect startup cycle and provider uncertainties.

6: Mitigating Risk
135
■If you are leveraging an IaaS provider (as in the Retail Stores example)
and your IT organization discovers that your provider does not encrypt its
backups, you might encrypt information before sending it to the cloud
for storage. This would allow you to take advantage of your provider’s
cloud services while mitigating the risk of vulnerabilities associated with
having sensitive information in clear text on their system, assuming you
keep the encryption keys local.
■Conducting a readiness assessment of moving applications to cloud prior
to deciding which applications to cloud-source from external providers is
an example of risk mitigation response that is commonly applied by
companies in the early stages of cloud adoption strategy development as
was discussed in Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise Cloud
Adoption Strategy.” The idea is to identify what applications are suitable
for cloud internally and determine the projected payback and total cost
of ownership of cloud enablement. Perhaps, for instance, it is more feasi-
ble to cloud enable some customized legacy systems because the capabil-
ity is critical to your global business operations. Without which, the
capability is limited to local consumption. In this example, the assess-
ment outcomes influence your cloud adoption roadmap and transition
plans. Keep in mind that the readiness assessment identified is only as
effective as its criteria, and your success is dependent on how well you
address the outcomes of the assessment including identified issues, risks,
and recommendations.
Another risk response strategy is to transfer the risk by contractually
stipulating that another organization is responsible for the risk. This
might be accomplished by purchasing insurance or by establishing a
governance structure where a systems integrator becomes responsible for
managing your cloud service provider. Some companies view the adop-
tion of on-premise “private” clouds as a way to transfer risks. Although
the “transfer” approach does not make another party solely accountable
for the risk, it provides a method of compensation and a point of contact
so that you can more effectively govern and manage business outcomes.
Organizations can respond with risk avoidance or risk aversion. In the
Retail Stores scenario, the organization might consider the impact of the
risk too great to undertake any action. If that is the case, Retail Stores
might limit the window of opportunity for using IaaS to peak seasons or
avoid participation in any IaaS adoption activities. The practice of risk
aversion stems from a dislike of taking risks. In such instances, Retail

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
136
Stores might proceed with the least risky option such as limiting the
type of IaaS services to those that might appear as safer choices, having
the least amount of direct impact to end users, such as backup or disaster
recovery services.
You might simply accept the risk. Companies often consider this
approach in lieu of mitigation when the cost of mitigation is higher than
the cost of the risk. Perhaps the cost to Retail Stores for a service is
greater than the cost of the negative impact if the risk comes to fruition.
In the Retail Stores scenario, the IT organization chose to accept the risk
and take advantage of IaaS services that were made available by a notable
public cloud provider for peak-time workload processing because the
probability of an unrecoverable failure on the provider’s behalf was
unlikely and the business impacts were insignificant relative to the
expected performance and downtime issues associated with using exist-
ing IT infrastructure.
While apprehensions pertaining to the value of cloud adoption are
subsiding, expressed concerns persist relative to quality of service (QoS)
guarantees, risks associated with consumption and governance of infor-
mation during and once contracts end, and deficits in cloud portability,1
which hinder your ability to effectively integrate with other applications
and data and force you into a vendor lock-in situation should you decide
to buy. You (the consumer) are accountable for mitigating such risks and
the impacts on your company.
This chapter presents an approach to minimizing the probability of
occurrence and the business impacts of some notable risks associated
with the adoption of cloud, followed by explicit actions that you should
consider as you develop and refine your enterprise cloud adoption strat-
egy. Throughout this chapter, you find applicability of mitigations to
older alternatives to cloud, such as IT outsourcing for extended clarity
and as a point of reference. Strategically planning your adoption and
incorporating cloud into your EA as discussed in previous chapters, mit-
igates business risks by influencing positive outcomes of your cloud
adoption. You are mitigating the risk of escalating costs by planning the
offload of workloads to experts that conduct business for you with
greater efficiencies; while at the same time strategically planning return
on investment (ROI) optimization by extending cloud investments
within your business unit and across your company as much as possible,
while taking advantage of the benefits typically associated with
economies of scale. As with any investment, there is always the possibility

137
that something could go wrong or not exactly as you expected and there-
fore risk mitigation is in order.
Focusing on several key areas facilitates successful cloud adoption.
The next section reviews these key areas offering risk mitigating ele-
ments that can be referenced and utilized to meet specific cloud business
requirements. These key areas include
■Enterprise adaptation
■Balancing information transparency and privacy
■Service level management
■Quality of service
■Globalization
Enterprise Adaptation
With the inception of cloud and the abundance of emerging offerings
in the marketplace, you might experience anxiety or a sense of being
overwhelmed, facing a growing amount of choices. As a part of your
decision criteria, you most likely require assurances that your choices of
adoption will positively meet the desired business outcomes whether it
is profitability, productivity, improved collaboration, penetration of new
markets, or improved innovation. Aspects of assurance include cred-
itability of providers and their capacity to integrate cloud offerings
within your current business models and systems, acceptance of your
cloud decisions by key stakeholders, and of course implementation of
key strategies that require cloud adoption.
Challenges to address for enterprise adaptation of cloud computing
involve addressing the following questions:
■How do we select cloud providers that are conducive to our business
strategy?
■What if we are not equipped to make sound cloud computing choices?
■How do we mitigate the risk of stakeholder rejection (e.g., fear of loss of
control, security, or ROI) of cloud adoption strategies as a business
imperative?

How Do We Select Cloud Providers That Are Conducive
to Our Business Strategy?
When considering cloud providers review the checklist presented in
Figure 6.1 and evaluate each area to mitigate the risk of investment
losses that stem from inadequate selection. The following list examines
each of these checklist items in more detail.
■Compliance: You must adhere to government or industry regulations
and corporate policy mandates. When it comes to compliance, you must
ensure that your providers conform to your regulations and corporate
policies. Take, for example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS) regulation, which is designed to reduce credit card
fraud by taking measures such as requiring encryption of credit card
transmissions across public networks. Now suppose you are audited and
it is determined that your transmissions are sometimes encrypted but not
in a consistent manner. It will be inexcusable to respond with something
along the lines of, “It is not my fault, the provider did it,” or
“Unfortunately, I did not have the bandwidth to complete any compli-
ance verifications during the provider selection process.”

regulations is included in the Epilogue, “Thinking Beyond the Race.”

Checklist for selecting cloud providers

6: Mitigating Risk
139
As with traditional outsourcing, your organization is ultimately account-
able for your sourcing decisions, and therefore as you go about establish-
ing and executing your provider selection criteria, make sure your
candidates are aware and adhere to corporate mandates that might require
obtaining security clearances before any business activities can com-
mence, or training may be mandated as a precursor to on-premise cloud
deployments; expect embedded compliance in product offerings and serv-
ices such as controls for those with powerful user and system rights; and
plan continuous monitoring of provider environments so that you know
what is going on and how they are performing—remaining mindful that
your provider’s environment is a representation of your business.
■Credibility: Obtained through your ability to trust your provider. It is
based on capabilities that matter most to you as a consumer. For example,
your candidate providers’ ability and willingness to partner with you to
produce new cloud product offerings. If this capability matters to you,
then it adds to provider credibility.
Credibility is validated by your candidate providers’ reputation and expe-
riences. If, for instance, your candidate has implemented cloud solutions
internally or they maintain proof-points of uptime and availability of
cloud provided services, then this establishes confidence and builds trust
in the investment.
■Customer-centricity: Representational of customer loyalty, customer
satisfaction ratings, and responsiveness to customer requests. Providers
that are customer-centric are able to communicate in business terms the
value and essentials of cloud adoption as it relates to your business needs.
They are more likely to understand you as a consumer and concentrate on
helping you reach and maintain your market presence and competitive
advantage. And they will likely be more flexible during contract negotia-
tions. This is a trait you should look for in provider candidates through
direct interchange, customer references, and even social media such as
blogs.

NOTE
Defensive behaviors or evasiveness when asked about clients might be
indicators of your candidate provider’s upcoming service performance.
Aside from moving on to other candidates, you might mitigate the risk of
unmet service expectations by taking the opportunity to bring the
behavior to their attention and clearly establish service delivery criteria
and expectations. Discussions on help desk services is an example talking
point, considering that some clients prefer Web-centric, self-service
features while others prefer traditional “phone call” interactions or a
combination thereof. Choose providers that can and will support your
business model and those that are sensitive to end user experiences.
■Expertise: It is obvious that you should choose providers with expertise
in consuming and delivering cloud solutions. Industry specialization and
expertise are also important. Expertise is deep skills in certain areas and
includes certifications. For example, Provider A’s expertise is SaaS with
specialization in customer relationship management (CRM) for telecom-
munications clients, and interestingly enough they have storage effi-
ciency depth, which is needed. Always look for expertise that will
influence and sustain your business strategy. Industry awards and global
recognition are viable means of validating your candidate provider’s cloud
expertise.
■Financial health: The financial health of your provider has direct corre-
lation to your business operations and is therefore a critical aspect of risk
mitigation. You should review their financial status periodically and on
demand, and you should include your explicit requirements during SLA
negotiations and upon creation. Here are some key elements that you
should examine:
■
How the company has performed financially over the past few
years and how this compares to competitors
■
Net worth
■
Operating cash flow
■
Balance sheet
■
Income statement
■
Dividend payments, if publicly traded
■
Earnings per share
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
140

6: Mitigating Risk
141
■
Percentage of company profits that stem from global markets
now and percentage that is forecasted
■
Whether the company pays its taxes
■
What employees are saying, tweeting, and blogging about the
state of financial health, retirement services, and suppliers
■
Whether the company is able to pay for employee and supplier
services
NOTE
The amount of time a provider has been in business and the amount of
client implementations or “sales” might provide comparative insights as
to how well your candidate is currently performing and offer clues as to
future performance. For example, consider the provider that has been in
business for seven years with two client implementations compared to the
provider that has been in business for two years with also two client
implementations. Which would you prefer? The size of the company,
complexity of the implementations, client satisfaction, and business
outcomes of the implementations become key evaluating factors.
■Total offering and service costs: Collectively examine the total offering
and service costs compared to other vendors and more importantly within
the context of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. While you might
narrow your scope of selection to storage clouds, for example, the selected
provider should offer a holistic set of services including project manage-
ment (which for some reason is easily overlooked when it comes to the
subject of cloud), strategy, planning, and governance at fair and quality
price points.
■Resiliency: A provider able to adapt quickly to technological advance-
ments and changing market pressures is an important attribute.
Resiliency also means integrated risk controls throughout all layers of
their enterprise architecture, which you will confirm, in an effort to solve
expected and unexpected business problems. The net effect of your candi-
dates’ involvement in acquisition and mergers, for instance, should be
seamless to your business operations.

■Transparency: When it comes to transparency, you need to subscribe to
cloud services that meet your requirements, preferably from an intuitive
catalog of offerings, and you need visibility to all charges as they are
incurred as well as the performance of your provider when you want and
need it. Your provider must be forthright and willingly provide timely
and accurate disclosure of information.
What If We Are Not Equipped to Make Sound Cloud
Computing Choices?
Many organizations commence cloud adoption on a small scale, such
as for a specific project or for a single department to gain a better under-
standing of the business opportunities and to experience the value of
cloud in the organization. This approach is a good way to “try out” solu-
tions before investing in more strategic, companywide initiatives. A case
in point is a mid-sized communications service provider, uncertain of
business growth, decided to adopt Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions
for a specific business unit’s program, working with a known cloud
provider.
The goal of the program was to (at an undetermined point in time)
extend the SaaS model to other business units, but the risk response
strategy took priority because of the uncertainty of the investment,
which contributed to commencing adoption with a small business unit.
They selected this unit because of confidence that they would receive the
best revenue margins by reselling SaaS instead of any other cloud service
types.
You might also take advantage of cloud consulting services (ensuring
that any organizations that you hire or partner with have both business
and technical service integration experiences) so that they guide you to
make effective cloud adoption decisions. Here are some considerations:
■Choose subject matter experts and consultants that have experienced
strategy and cloud implementations internal to their own companies so
that you know they have experienced the impacts of their recommenda-
tions.
■Expect them to be able to recommend, operate as, or govern cloud service
brokers (CSBs).2 Recall from Chapter 5, “What About Governance?,”
that the role and responsibilities of the CSB can vary so be sure to clearly
articulate and explicitly document your expectations.
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
142

6: Mitigating Risk
143
■Partner to develop the right cloud adoption strategy for your business.
This involves evaluating the capacity of your own organization as well as
determining health assessments for potential cloud providers making use
of the financial and delivery criteria described earlier in this chapter. You
need to ensure that your targeted cloud services integrate effectively with
your existing business and technical strategy, and your consultants should
help you identify any organizational change requirements that support
adoption decisions.
■Leverage market insights and analysis capabilities of consultants so that
you select the best cloud services considering price, quality, market
demographics, channels, and uptake potential of cloud solutions and
services.
■Rely on your consultants to understand your business so that they can
effectively help you choose viable adoption entry and end points.
How Do We Mitigate the Risk of Stakeholder Rejection?
Key to success in this area is to understand and effectively articulate
your business pain points and needs. This should be followed with a key
set of cloud adoption use cases illustrating how the use of cloud
addresses the needs and eliminates pain points. You must be able to
communicate your business case to stakeholders in a way that the mes-
saging resonates, which means in addition to knowing your situation,
you must know your recipients’ roles and responsibilities so that you
understand the best approach to deliver and communicate your case.
Consider the following examples:
■Emphasize how the use of cloud can mitigate business risks such as lost
customers and declining profits due to system performance and quality
issues as was illustrated in the Retail Stores scenario. Or how adoption
(public or private) might save you from investing in tools where contin-
ued use beyond a project is unlikely, which might contribute to wasteful
spending. Or show stakeholders where the exacerbation of negative busi-
ness outcomes due to manual or ineffective business processes, or inade-
quate disaster recovery procedures is likely to continue without the use of
cloud. There are also reports that imply that by outsourcing data and
applications to cloud, a company can reduce security exposures by utiliz-
ing the expertise of the best in the business to ensure that their data is
secure.3

Other examples are provided throughout this chapter as well as in
Appendix B, “Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions.”
■Illustrate how the use of cloud removes barriers to entry for small and
large companies around the globe, saving in capital and operational costs
now and over extended periods of time. If you can, support this statement
with projections to the impacts on your profit margins.
■Illustrate how time and effort spent on manual processes can be auto-
mated or augmented with cloud-sourcing, making mergers, acquisitions,
and channel partnership alliances occur swifter and smoother than past
business transactions.
■Compare the use of cloud with time-sharing that allows a large number
of users to interact concurrently with a single computer, dramatically
lowering the cost of computing capability. Cloud operates in pretty much
the same fashion where users are able to interact with a single cloud that
contains pools of compute capacity (servers, storage, processes, and oth-
ers) that are consumed when needed. As with time-sharing, the cloud
delivery model contributes to lowered costs for conducting business.
■Server farm facts and analogies might present an effective means of con-
necting and communicating the value of cloud with stakeholders. A
server farm is a collection of computing systems in the form of clusters
and maintained by an organization to accomplish business needs that
require capacity beyond one machine. Server farms have primary and
backup servers with failover and redundancy so that your business contin-
ues to operate in the event of server failures, but the costs to maintain can
be steep. In the past, you might have invested in in-house server farms
and relied on outsourced service providers to run the farms and manage
your operations. Today, you can rely on server farms at significantly low-
ered costs with even greater IT capacity and managed infrastructure in
the cloud.
In summary, take the time to get to know your real business needs and
opportunities for cloud so that you develop a solid business case. Follow that
up with appropriate messaging so that you connect with stakeholders and
allow them to understand the value of using cloud to effectively solve busi-
ness problems and create opportunities for innovation.
Establish shared understanding and responsibility when it comes to
managing business risk. Your corporate social responsibility standards,
for instance, must be communicated throughout your global channels
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
144

6: Mitigating Risk
145
and you must conduct proactive monitoring to ensure adherence across
such channels. Considering the rapid pace of information exchange in
our society, can you imagine the potential damages to your reputation if
your providers are involved in ethical violations such as unfair labor
practices? It just might not matter to an alarmed public that internally
you are conforming to all labor laws.
One of the larger problems within enterprises is a stronger need for
cross-collaboration and joint decision making between business and IT
teams. This omission often hinders business performance as a whole. A
way to mitigate this risk is through augmented responsibilities and role
reversals so that stakeholders better appreciate each other’s responsibili-
ties and think outside their immediate domains when making business
decisions.
As an example, evolve your IT leadership responsibilities to incorpo-
rate business strategies. The strategy team should fully understand
enterprise business objectives so that business needs are addressed appro-
priately be it through the use of cloud or other delivery models. In other
words, infuse business leadership in what some might perceive as tradi-
tional IT responsibilities. You might, for example, empower IT leader-
ship to develop marketing strategies and cloud campaigns.
At the same time, evolve your business leadership responsibilities to
incorporate IT strategy. This might include business partnering with IT
leadership to introduce innovative yet secure strategies—yes the refer-
ence to security is intentional here given that security is a joint business
and IT responsibility—and engaging IT leadership in what some might
perceive as traditional business responsibilities.
NOTE
An interesting and related article was published by McKinsey Quarterly
titled “Reshaping IT Management for Turbulent Times.”4 The article
speaks to “Factory IT,” which emphasizes driving efficiency, optimizing
delivery, and lowering unit costs, while “Enabling IT” focuses on helping
organizations respond more efficiently to business needs through
innovation and growth. While I recommend the article and agree with
both IT models presented, I also believe that there should be reshaping of
business organizations to support the emerging IT organization and to
more efficiently manage enterprise risks.

Effective organizational change management reduces the risk of rejec-
tion of cloud adoption as a business investment strategy by employees
and business partners. Rejection generally stems from some sort of fear,
for example, fear of dissolution of work, or hesitancy to step out of one’s
comfort zone and undertake new ventures due to fear of failure, and so
on. Explicit mitigations are to quickly communicate the value to
employees first, such as alternate career choices within your company
along with the implications on your business as a whole, such as
improved transport of citizens in emergency situations like a natural dis-
aster due to cloud-enabled communication channels, and invite employ-
ees to partake in adoption efforts including education and training
programs in which they will benefit. A conversation (backed with
action) with employees on the opportunity to grow and transition from
developing systems to developing social skills so that they will excel at
leading cloud enterprise integration efforts is an example, another is the
opportunity for some employees to exert their energies to research and
develop business transformation case studies so that the use of cloud for
activities such as idea management, business process optimization, or
business intelligence is identified, socialized, and optimized throughout
your organization and your partner community.
While this section discussed risk mitigation with emphasis on gain-
ing stakeholder and business partner acceptance, discussions continue as
a part of transition planning in Chapter 7, “Planning the Transition.”
Information Privacy and Transparency: 
Striking the Right Balance
Many analyst reports pertaining to barriers to cloud adoption cite
information security at the top of the list with an underlying theme of
balancing information privacy and transparency. In other words, your
provider must safeguard your information as well as your customers’
information, yet allow access to authorized users and authorized usage in
accordance with service level agreements (SLAs) and regulatory stipula-
tions. Next is a discussion of explicit mitigations for balancing informa-
tion privacy and transparency, as illustrated in Figure 6.2:
1. Conduct audits.
2. Apply information classification policies.
3. Share appropriate information.

Balancing information privacy and transparency
Plan audits of your provider’s data centers. Formal audits should be
conducted by third parties and through onsite visits, while informal
audits can be as convenient as daily reporting on the health of your
provider’s environment and success rates at blocking threats.
There are risks associated with not sharing information as was men-
tioned in a Taco Bell lawsuit where faster online defense messages could
have helped the company’s reputation in response to digital messaging
that alleged that Taco Bell’s seasoned beef did not meet USDA require-
ments.5 There is the Wikileaks6 situation that soberly reminds us to
carefully develop and understand the significance of SLAs. Recall that
services were shut down by providers due to alleged security breaches,
and more important is the heightened awareness that transpired of the
need for shared responsibility to control access and govern the use of
information within and external to organizations.
To address risks of this nature, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)7
suggests providers of critical services demonstrate information security
management and control by achieving International Organization for
Standards (ISO) 27001 certification or at best a subset of business func-
tions certified with ISO 27002.8 In addition to common sense, here are
some key questions that you should ask and expect answered and
addressed during audits:

■Who has access to physical data centers?
■Who has access to your and your company’s information?
■Is there traceability of information flow within and across clouds? To
what extent?
■Are employees audited? What are processes and frequency to block
insider threats? What is their background check policy when hiring?
■What are access, storage, and retention policies for audited information?
■Is your provider abiding by and performing to contract?
■Is your provider willing to produce evidence of regulatory compliance?
■Can your provider and global outsourcers (if applicable) show evidence of
cooperation with local law enforcement or regulatory agencies that may
require access to information and relative assets?
■What types of vulnerability tests does your provider conduct and is this
to your level of satisfaction?
■What kinds of security are afforded to information at rest or in flight?
(Ex: encryption.)
■What certifications does your provider hold—are they relevant and up to
date?
■Does your provider have an acceptable risk management strategy? For
example, does it encompass risk response plans?
■How are SLAs managed?
■What are disaster recovery procedures?
■What governance, management, and architectural principles does your
provider apply and how does this compare to other providers?
In addition to audits, you must understand your enterprise informa-
tion classification policy. This policy defines several different sensitivity
levels of information and their commensurate security controls. When
selecting a cloud provider or cloud solutions, the classification of your
information should be considered. For instance, if the information you
want to process is confidential data based on your enterprise classifica-
tions, then consider adoption of private clouds rather than external pub-
lic cloud offerings. If your information is public, then public cloud
adoption might be more appropriate. Of course, a precursor to this
process is to understand your workloads and to determine which enter-
prise information classification category applies to you, as this guides
information sourcing as well as sharing decisions.
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
148

6: Mitigating Risk
149
Organizations sometimes consider a hybrid approach to cloud adop-
tion. By protecting confidential information via encryption or by redact-
ing sensitive information prior to submitting the information to their
cloud provider, they are able to protect their most sensitive information
assets while still benefiting from the cost benefits of sharing and
exchanging information using public cloud computing. The point is to
seek mitigating controls, either contractually, through SLAs or guaran-
tees, or internally by protecting sensitive information before it egresses
your organization.
Consider the following example where mitigating controls include
contractual agreements, SLAs, and protection of information upon entry
and exit of the cloud environment: A government agency decided to
adopt SaaS solutions that would be hosted in an off-premise commercial
cloud. The requirement was that the commercial cloud provider secures
all materials including Internet exchanges. Detailed security SLA’s
address integrity, confidentiality, accessibility, single-tenancy, ports, and
protocols such as secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security
(TLS) for Web traffic. The commercial cloud provider is also required to
ensure compliance with regulations such as Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) and Federal Risk and Authorization program
(FedRamp). As a cloud exit strategy, the agency required that data be
exported to a destination and permanently destroyed from the commer-
cial provider’s system. The SLA included validation that controls are in
place through government required accreditations along with scheduled
and on-demand audits of the commercial cloud provider’s data center.
Service Level Management (SLM)
Service level management (SLM) is critical for cloud-sourcing and in
many ways to a greater degree than traditional outsourcing because the
risks of poor SLM can be costly. SLM is the process of negotiating service
level agreements (SLAs) and ensuring that SLAs are delivered when and
where they are supposed to be delivered. When they are not, SLM also
provides methods for invoking performance improvement plans (PIPs)
for remediation of chronic failures in SLA attainment. SLM involves
comparing actual performance with predefined expectations and taking
the appropriate actions. The following are some explicit mitigation
actions, with emphasis on service level negotiations and governance of
contracts in conjunction with integrated service management:

1. Establish enterprisewide communication protocols for contracts to
ensure that cloud adoption guidelines and policies are rapidly
socialized and adhered to by authorized buyers and designees.
Buyers, for instance, must know which providers and services are
approved as well as those that are not. Procedures for granting
exceptions to guidelines and policies should be documented.
2. Contract negotiations should at a minimum involve your adminis-
tration department, including policy experts, legal, your enterprise
architect, security, and other key business and IT leaders to ensure
that agreements are viable and so that terms and conditions are fair.
3. Negotiate mutually beneficial contracts, which most likely require
revisions to standard contracts. For example, in addition to under-
standing and merely accepting the details of standard contracts,
negotiate trial periods that allow you to explore options and termi-
nate contracts more easily if necessary, and negotiate incentives
such as client reference and joint case study participation or online
product promotional activities for providers in support of contract
flexibility.
4. Include scheduled and on-demand “right to audit” clauses to be
conducted by credible third parties with expertise in assessing and
validating information systems security. Statement on Standards for
Attestation Engagement (SSAE) 16 is quickly becoming the stan-
dard in this area, succeeding the previous Statement on Auditing
Standards (SAS) 70 report. Experienced cloud assessors are of course
beneficial. A couple of red flags to watch out for are 1) your provider
is unwilling to allow audits and/or 2) they insist that audits be con-
ducted by insiders or parties with whom you disagree. Such cases are
clues to control the scope to noncritical, non-confidential options or
move on to other providers.
5. Negotiate termination clauses such as your right to dissolve agree-
ments at any time at little or no additional charges—no charges
might be difficult but certainly a point of negotiation; expected
return locations of your information and assets; return formats (for
example hard copy reports and XML formatted data may be suffi-
cient for public, nonclassified cloud use); and notify providers on
what to do with your information once a contract ends keeping in
mind that there are regulatory agencies that may require informa-
tion to be archived but not destroyed for e-discovery and other
legalities. In any case, require demonstrable confirmation that exit
criteria is applied (for example, disk wiping removes information
Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
150

6: Mitigating Risk
151
completely from hard drives with unrecoverable options, so in addi-
tion to insisting on disk wiping, you might consider observing the
activity as it transpires).
6. Although standard liability clauses are usually available, work with
your legal team and your provider to establish fair liability clauses
and adequate recourses in the event of security or other contract
breaches. This is particularly needful to prevent undue costs to your
organization for provider course correction and actions such as sys-
tem outages. Remediation should be negotiated during the SLA
process, but there is no doubt going to be unexpected occurrences so
fair liability clauses should address these circumstances as well.
7. It is common for one cloud provider to use the services of others.
Obligate and hold your provider or systems integrator with whom
you are directly conducting business accountable for service level
agreements and performance, including those of downstream
providers.
8. Is it required that providers own your information and, if so why?
Essentially, you should own your information, and you should
express this during contract refinements along with specifics, such
as “intellectual property is not to be shared, sold, or even discussed
without expressed and written consent.” You must also make provi-
sions in case of provider bankruptcy or acquisitions, without which
your assets are likely to become inaccessible. Work with your legal
team for appropriate nomenclature for such circumstances.
9. Through partnership with your provider, apply integrated service
management (ISM) principles as depicted in Figure 6.3 for business
and operational effectiveness and to mitigate any risks associated
with cloud adoption. The essence of ISM is enablement of consumer
visibility into the performance of services internal and external to
cloud, greater control of your environment, automated processes
that contribute to reduced errors and cost avoidance, along with
increased operational efficiencies.
For example, given that you are sharing the use of cloud services
using either single or multitenant paradigms, if your provider relo-
cates to a new data center, adds or removes suppliers, or perhaps
peaks and valleys in consumption become unpredictable, you expect
no adverse impacts to your operations. And while you may have
already specified this in SLAs, applying ISM principles grants
insights into changes before they occur and allows you to validate
impacts so that you can better anticipate the appropriate next steps.

NOTE
Suffice it to say do not limit ISM to systemic aspects only; remember that
your enterprise performance is comprised of business and technology, so
focus on the impacts of enterprise cloud adoption and risk mitigation from
business perspectives as well as within cloud-specific environments. For
instance, in the area of change management, are employees adequately
trained to manage teams in a heterogeneous environment that now
encompasses cloud? In the area of work management, have you developed a
strategy for balancing and distributing employee workloads to cloud? And
one more, from a knowledge management perspective are you able to
leverage information provided in the cloud in a timely and effective manner
so that you drive business profitability through the use of managed hosted
cloud solutions and services? This holistic approach to ISM ensures that you
are conducting integrated and end-to-end service management.

You should insist that all activities listed in Figure 6.3 are con-
ducted and do not just put the responsibility on providers as related
efficiencies must occur internally. Remember, although your sourc-
ing providers are responsible for various aspects of your value chain,
you hold ultimate accountability for the final product. And should
your providers want activities to remain seamless to you, for exam-
ple incident management, mandate continuous monitoring so that
you are always in tune with what is going on with your information
and assets. You can use the following as a reference for establishing
and managing service levels. While mitigations in each of the areas
are fairly intuitive and have been touched on throughout this chap-
ter, Performance and Quality of Service Management warrant fur-
ther discussion. You can also find descriptions of each of the
categories in the Glossary.
Performance and Quality of Service
A first step in mitigating the risk of inadequate performance and QoS
issues is to require provider notification of all discrepancies as well as
corrective measures taken. You should feel free to challenge corrective
actions for the good of your company. Systemic or chronic QoS incidents
require deeper problem management and development of a performance
improvement program to resolve these recurring issues.
A second step is establishment and continuous review of performance
measurements so that impacts of discrepancies are understood, prefer-
ably prior to occurrences.
A third step is to establish and apply remediation that encourages
your provider to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
Table 6.1 provides some QoS attributes and mitigation considerations
as you prepare your cloud adoption strategy. Each should be considered
along with the contents provided throughout this chapter.

Availability
Availability is the amount of time
your cloud is actually operating in
comparison to the total time it
should be operating and usually ref-
erenced in 9’s. For instance, five 9’s
implies that cloud services are up
and available to you for consump-
tion 99.999% of the time during
the year or 5.26 minutes per year 
of downtime, excluding planned
outages.
The most appropriate mitigation is to
avoid single points of failure (SPOF),
which means providers should employ
distributed models for information
processing, and embrace partnering for
effective use of alternate service
providers, as well as replicate data cen-
ters for rapid recovery and continuity.
This is particularly significant in situa-
tions where outages are unacceptable or
the negative implications are too costly
for your business to financially recover.
Also, ensure the availability measure
you’re using is aligned to the business
value of the service. For example, if you
are engaging a SaaS provider for your
corporate e-mail solution, ensure that
the SLA measures the availability of
the mail service instead of an infra-
structure component, such as the net-
work or servers.
If your provider does not meet your
minimum SLAs, you may mitigate by
eliminating your service provider as an
SPOF by, for example, having multiple
providers working in parallel as an
ecosystem that is prepared to partner
and backfill for each other as required.
Consumability Consumability9 implies that your
cloud solution has the right design,
installation, configuration, quality,
information, integration and main-
tenance.
Consumable cloud solutions enable
you to achieve faster time to value,
they reduce your total cost of own-
ership, and they reduce support and
maintenance costs.
Some mitigation activities are to con-
duct viability assessments, with an
emphasis on strategic motivators such
as data center transformation, user
experience, and integration of cloud
solutions across people, process, infor-
mation, and technology early in the
cloud adoption life cycle so that issues
are surfaced and addressed prior to the
need for service consumption.

Portability
Portability allows for an easier tran-
sition or move of your assets from
one provider to another or between
a public and internally hosted 
environment.
The use of open standards and inter-
faces helps mitigate the risk of locking
consumers to specific providers and
induces portability of clouds across
platforms. Any services that your
provider can offer to ease portability
such as export software to close down
cloud environments and are welcomed.
Portability attributes should influence
your decisions relative to provider
selection.
Reliability
Reliability is also referenced as
dependability. Reliability provides
assurance that cloud services are not
only available (mentioned above)
but perform consistently and
according to your security require-
ments and SLAs when expected. As
an example, when you contact your
provider for a quote do you get the
same results as your co-worker if
you both consume services at the
same time or within the expected
timeframes where rates are 
consistent?
A good way to mitigate risks associ-
ated with unreliable cloud services is to
establish scenarios and test for consis-
tency in availability and performance
prior to contract finalization. This
process also involves evaluation of
other consumers and their experiences
with providers and service capabilities.

Globalization
As with offshoring and outsourcing, globalization is significant when
it comes to cloud adoption. Benefits such as reduced barriers to entry
into new and emerging markets and a global pool of resources (business
processes, applications, compute, and humans) are made available and
readily accessible to support your business needs. Many small and large
businesses, for instance, are taking advantage of disaster recovery capa-
bilities in the cloud as a way to mitigate the risk of natural disasters and
other business uncertainties. However, while there are advantages to
globalization, there are also risks.

Scalability
When it comes to scalability, your
resources shrink or grow based on
demand. It is like the “Just-In-
Time” model of manufacturing
where capacity is there when
needed and excess capacity is per-
ceived as waste and therefore
avoided.
As with the other QoS attributes,
scalability encompasses optimiza-
tion of business capacity (e.g., ade-
quate utilization and staffing of
employees when and where needed
to support business growth and
environmental changes).
Scalability mitigates the risk of services
becoming unavailable or performing
poorly and in particular at inopportune
times. Scalability should be automated
as much as possible for faster commis-
sioning and decommissioning of serv-
ices when and where needed and to
minimize variable costs. Resource
pooling and cloud bursting are two
example scalability techniques that you
can expect from providers.
Serviceability
Serviceability involves early diagno-
sis of faults to prevent system
downtimes. Should something go
wrong, you need problems fixed
and issues resolved quickly and
with precision.
Serviceability is also referenced as
supportability, which implies that
proper resources are in place to
quickly diagnose and resolve 
matters.
From a business perspective, you want
your providers to establish proper
processes to detect and fix defects and
inadequacies in real-time and as fast as
reasonably possible. This involves more
effective use of call center resources
along with automatic notification of
events and autonomic processes or self-
healing. Customer service, including
self-service capability, is an important
aspect of serviceability.

157
Some countries for instance mandate that applications, data, and
intellectual property reside within the country of origin or designated
locations, and some require that the same citizens that build the clouds
manage and operate the same cloud environments. You must understand
such requirements and integrate these considerations into all phases of
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy including Requests for
Information and Proposals (RFIs/RFPs) from candidate providers.
Concerns about physical security of data centers where consumers
have no control are justifiable considering the numerous reports of
related incidents; this includes internal and external organizational
threats. Therefore, in addition to developing provider selection criteria
and audit checklists as described earlier in this chapter, you should
expect and probe for proof of physical environment security. At a mini-
mum, check for proper authentication protocols for data center entrance
and exits, protected internal event logging and monitoring of facilities
with adequate encryption, external sensors that are in operation and ade-
quately secure premises, along with strong intrusion-detection for fire-
walls, systems, and data from both internal and external sources.
Summary
Recently, a couple appeared on the first episode of Million Dollar
Money Drop, an American game show, and wagered $800,000 in answer
to a question pertaining to Post-it Notes. According to a report pub-
lished on ABC News,10 the couple felt confident in the wager and pro-
vided the correct answer, but game show representatives thought the
answer was incorrect and, as a result, the couple lost all $800,000. Later,
the game show acknowledged the mistake and offered the couple an
opportunity to play again on the show. Who would have thought such a
situation would transpire? What could have been done to prevent the
error? While subjective, what are some appropriate recourses to provider
errors?
In a cloud setting, it can be challenging when it comes to determin-
ing the right level of recourse since you have little insights into the
operations of your provider. It is therefore more critical than ever 
to think and plan for the unexpected early in the life cycle of your 
enterprise cloud adoption strategy through development of explicit serv-
ice and operational level requirements, establishing reasonable and

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
158
attainable agreements, and executing established mitigations such as
those highlighted in this chapter. Examples include demanding proof 
of compliance, conducting performance audits, and gaining visibility
into your provider’s environment and business operations as much as
possible.
This chapter opened with a discussion on cloud risk management and
risk response planning. Once the context was established, practical
examples were applied that described how to mitigate risks associated
with cloud adoption, such as information security breaches, cost over-
runs, and inadequate operational performance by making explicit miti-
gations—many of which are implicit with older alternatives to cloud
such as IT outsourcing, time sharing, and in-house server farms.
Three common organizational challenges were posed as questions,
with mitigating responses:
1. Can we do something to prevent selection of cloud providers that
are not conducive to our business strategy? You will find included a
checklist for choosing cloud providers (refer to Figure 6.1) along
with in-depth discussions.
2. What should we do if we are not equipped to adequately evaluate
and make sound cloud choices yet we are interested in the business
of cloud? Included are practical insights from other companies.
3. How do we mitigate the risk of stakeholder rejection of cloud adop-
tion as a business imperative? This section included a discussion on
how the use of cloud can reduce risk for your organization.
Balancing information privacy and transparency can present chal-
lenges as organizations strive to find the right levels of equilibrium,
while service level management principles remain consistent but
with a focus on integrated consumer and provider management.
Service level management can mitigate risks of system outages and
performance issues that stem from inadequate contingency plan-
ning. Globalization has implications (positive and negative) to your
cloud adoption strategy that are similar to traditional outsourcing
and offshoring. Each of these topics was addressed in this chapter.
The next chapter considers and continues this discussion as it guides
you through some essentials for enterprise cloud transformation and
transition planning.

Hindsight is 20-20 or so the saying goes. The implication is that your vision
is clearer when you look back because you can see actual outcomes of actual events.
The mere fact that you should learn from yours as well as the experiences of oth-
ers makes this saying a good idea, but it also begs the question, “In our rapid
paced world, new economic environment, and increasingly complex society, how
can we effectively glance at the past yet reflect long enough to apply experiences
for our future?” This chapter discusses transition planning considerations,
including (but not limited to) the business of cloud computing. Intertwined are
discussions on change management and the necessity of rapid insights into infor-
mation and experiences (positive or not) to prepare your company for an effective
transition in achieving the benefits and transformation opportunities available
with cloud computing.
Relating Transition and Implementation Planning
Your decision to move forward with investing in cloud requires care-
fully thought out transition planning. This involves analysis of business,
161
Planning the Transition

technological, and organizational change. Clarity and distinction
between transition and implementation planning is first in order.
Transition planning focuses on strategic activities that are necessary
to achieve the objectives of the enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
Implementation planning is a bit more tactical as it focuses on the mul-
tiple threads and projects, that must be completed for the transition to
be successful. Both are change agents and are required for an effective
enterprise cloud adoption transformation. Transition planning is all
about understanding the required activities to prepare your company for
your target state; in this case, your target state is enterprise cloud adop-
tion strategy development. Your transition plan ensures your readiness
by identifying resources (people, processes, information, technology, and
governance) and companywide actions that prepare you for effective exe-
cution of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. Essential elements of
transitional planning include the following:
■Review of lessons learned such as previous outsourcing and transforma-
tional experiences. What worked, what didn’t work and why? What risk
mitigation strategies were employed? What did the organizations learn
to do differently?
■Recommending organizational changes such as new design authorities,
changing roles, revised scope for Enterprise Architecture, training, com-
munication plans, or other governance changes.
■Recommending new or augmented business models for penetrating new
markets, geographies, or increasing market share.
■Development of actionable roadmaps.
NOTE
The transition plan forms part of the target state cost/value assessment. It
is important to compare not just the current state versus the target state
but also take into account the steps and costs associated with getting to
the end state. A transition plan is often “executed” by the creation of
successive candidate projects to perform the steps of the transition; the
planning of the successive candidate projects is categorized as
implementation planning.

7: Planning the Transition
163
Your implementation plans are steps that occur to plan for realizing
cloud projects. During implementation planning, consumers confirm
providers, business solutions, and service level agreements that were
strategically formed during transition planning. Some organizations
include application development in this phase; however, for the purposes
of this discussion, the focus is preparation and planning for the imple-
mentation. Figure 7.1 illustrates the relationships between transition
and implementation planning. Both are considered when developing
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
The Business of Cloud
While the service delivery and infrastructure aspects of cloud are
obvious, user experiences and the business aspects are often overlooked.
Change to your business model, however, is at least as important as the
technological change and more impactful to the business. In fact, with-
out proper planning of the transition, your cloud initiatives are likely to
generate unresponsiveness causing your strategy to become stale, nonac-
tionable, and susceptible to failure.
Consider some structural pitfalls of a traditional computing model:
■Servers are owned by individual business units, and cost is allocated based
on the number of servers.
■Personnel and support costs are not measured so the cost of maintaining
an IT organization is allocated as uniform, equally distributed overhead.
■Service level agreements (SLAs) are defined and managed but not in a
workload-sensitive fashion.
■Business units wait in queues for IT services delaying time to market.
■Capital is spent to extend IT capabilities in new geographies or business
units.

In such an environment, there is no transparency of end user charges
for services rendered or the chargeback model is one of equal distribu-
tion across the enterprise (regardless of whether you are using services).
With the inception of cloud, an important transition consideration and
business model change is that now business leaders have direct influence
or “say so” when it comes to providers, service levels, and adoption as a
whole. Figure 7.2 illustrates a summary of business aspects of cloud and
changes that you can expect to your business model, which include the
following:
■Self-service
■Speed, rapid development, and service delivery
■Flexible pricing, pay per use
■Café style services

Self-Service
Self-service is an important benefit of your cloud transition as it
empowers you to choose the services that want at your own pace. In a
self-service environment, the way you buy software and hardware is dif-
ferent from traditional purchasing since you buy from a storefront or
service catalogue. The challenge is that you might already have procure-
ment processes in place and with the inclusion of cloud, your procure-
ment processes require adjustments to incorporate self-service along
with traditional-style buying patterns.
Along with the empowerment aspects of self-service is recognition of
the need for personal contact and help-desk support. For instance, you
may have some employees that prefer the chatting mechanisms because
they like the quick, crisp responses to inquiries, while others might pre-
fer personal contact such as a telephone call. You know your organiza-
tion and these are cloud business capabilities that you should consider as
cultural readiness, while negotiating what’s best for your organization
with providers.
A flexible governance model is required that establishes authority for
ordering and approving changes in your environment because surely you
are not interested in anyone and everyone ordering the standup of new
environments because it is now easy and convenient. In a nutshell, the
self-service aspects of cloud require planning well in advance of imple-
mentation discussions.
Speed, Rapid Development, and Service Delivery
You are required to deliver with speed and agility, which is why you
invested in cloud or why you are now giving cloud computing consider-
ation for transformation, flexibility, and realization of new opportuni-
ties. As such, you need to ensure your enterprise cloud adoption strategy
and product or software development life cycles are complementary. As
an example, you can leverage cloud applications (such as SaaS analytics)
to swiftly access and analyze consumer behaviors and respond with ade-
quate inventory and product pricing scenarios if you coordinate the tim-
ing of SaaS adoption to precede the release of new products. In addition,
your transition plans should include enterprise mobilization and alloca-
tions for research and development for continued market discovery such
that you reap optimal returns on your investments.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
166
NOTE
Some of you may presume that product development and speedy service
delivery have nothing to do with you if you are a consumer of cloud
services, but that is not the case. Many companies are consuming public
cloud services, for instance, to speed up and improve the test and
deployment cycle times as well as product development cycles that for
instance involves software development. And many are pursuing cloud
because of the specialized services and efficiencies, such as global scale and
rapid access to critical information. As an example, predictive analytics
solutions that are available in the cloud are quite popular for advancing
global merchandising and retail sales. These cloud enabled capabilities
and skills are compelling for many companies because they simply cannot
be matched in-house.
Key questions to address:
■Are leaders in your company aware of your cloud adoption goals and the
potential benefits to their organizations?
■Are leaders in your company aware of how cloud computing could deliver
on their tactical and strategic goals?
■Are you thinking of all the value propositions of cloud computing rather
than IT improvements only?
A benefit of cloud is the rapid provisioning capability that enables
your enterprise to deliver goods and services faster with little to no cost
of ownership. A related benefit is the elimination of “just in case” over-
capacity. What does this mean? Well traditionally fluctuations and
spikes in workloads have been catered to with overcapacity principles in
anticipation of unexpected demands. This was brought about due to
lengthy setup and configuration cycles. Cloud changes this mode of
operation for you. With rapid provisioning, there is much less of a need
for you to engage in and pay for excess capacity (including both people
as well as IT capacity) as was the situation in the past.
Rapid provisioning does introduce a change in traditional risk adver-
sity options as it requires collaborative decision making in an effort to
drive effective adoption of cloud such that risks of unfulfilled business

7: Planning the Transition
167
events (foreseen and unforeseen) are mitigated. As an example, your
transition plan should encompass capacity planning that addresses
unpredictable circumstances such as when and if a primary cloud
provider cannot deliver on short notice, in which case alternative
providers are a viable option. You might not finalize “how to” details
during transition planning; however, you can agree to acceptable busi-
ness policies and standards for your organization, which will carry for-
ward into implementation planning and project execution.
As you plan for implementation, be sure to consider and ask providers
about their fast-track, agile approaches to cloud solution delivery
including development of documentation. You might also discover that
some activities and work artifacts are not required within your own
organization. At the same time, there are key elements of development
life cycles (for both software and products), such as viability assessments,
requirements baselining, testing, and quality assurance that may cause
more harm than good if eliminated; however, you might be able to speed
up delivery cycles. While you can find more elaborations on this subject
in Appendix A, “Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud,” some
common points of implementation planning that you might prepare
your teams to discuss with selected providers follow:
1. Share your vision, your target state, and your budget. In other
words, communicate your enterprise cloud adoption strategy with
your delivery teams and providers.
2. Discuss predefined use cases of the cloud service offering so that the
focus on contract development and signature is validation and
refinements for any customization. Validate with your go-to-market
strategy.
3. Develop a use case model and request product demonstrations to
validate fulfillment of your strategic business opportunities as well
as your service requirements.
4. Discuss predefined test cases of the cloud service offering.
5. Conduct at least one workshop with providers to collectively define
and gain consensus of the offering and capabilities as well as to
ensure that they understand your vision. Since cloud solutions can
be sourced from numerous angles such as outsourced providers, serv-
ice brokers, in-house, and others, a key service description attribute
to record and consider when scoping the effort is the source.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
168
6. Complementary to steps 2 and 3, commence project implementa-
tion with refinements to requirements and design components
applying an agile approach. This differs from traditional methods
where project start includes requirements gathering and more of a
waterfall approach to solution delivery.
NOTE
In previous chapters, you learned of the significance of business agility
and that this is one of the principle benefits of integrating cloud into your
enterprise architecture. Complementary, you need to practice agile
solution delivery considering that traditional methodologies are too
cumbersome and quite frankly, too slow. Without the practice of agile
solution delivery where iterative parallel delivery cycles (design,
development and test) or “sprints” transpire, you could very well defeat
the purpose of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
Flexible Pricing, Pay Per Use
Proper metering and billing are both easy and complex with cloud—
easier due to the pay per use aspect yet complex because your organiza-
tion now needs to precisely understand which department owns what
and who should pay for what services. You might be one of those enter-
prises that have some understanding of which systems or business trans-
actions belong to what business units, but not at workload-specific
levels. Shared services in particular can be difficult to track without
proper instrumentation. Similar challenges exist in the business process
arena, for instance, who should pay for the credit score process—a sub
process of an overarching account opening business process? The mes-
sage here is as follows:
■Workload instrumentation such as dashboard upgrades for more visibility
and transparency might require enhancements.
■Internal invoicing processes might require adjustments.

7: Planning the Transition
169
■Due to pay per use, it is possible that some business units may end up
paying more or less than what they did before as a result of chargeback
precision.
One of your transition planning responsibilities is to determine what com-
munications strategy and mechanisms are most effective for notifying stake-
holders of the business impacts and benefits of cloud computing.
The other aspect of this topic is establishing the proper pricing strategy
that is conducive to your budget and planning processes. Pay per use is good,
but some consumers need to plan on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis.
Providers must accommodate such needs when building service offerings,
invoicing, and establishing service levels. Flexible pricing and the tools
required to get you where you need to be in your journey to cloud adoption
are critical success factors for your transformation.
Café-Style Services
Many organizations, even those that apply EA, continue to have dif-
ferent business models per business unit, either for historical reasons or
because the funding model allows for unique or proprietary require-
ments. You must agree to standardized services (for example, bundles)
and service levels (for example, gold, bronze, and silver, no warranty). At
the same time, as a consumer, you do not want to feel as though your
choices are limited or that you are paying for what you do not use, right?
Take, for example, cable television channels where you think about how
many channels you watch compared to what you pay. Are you paying for
the services you receive or are you locked into paying for more than what
you need? How does your provider support change to standardized serv-
ices to support specialized customer requirements? Regardless of the
type of cloud that you are consuming (public, private, or hybrid), dis-
cussions with business leaders that express the value of café-style offer-
ings that balance standardization and consumer-flexibility must be a
part of your transition planning activities.
Leaner
You most likely have adopted lean principles, hence the title of this
section. You can now launch new services and offerings with fewer staff
and without the traditional delays and costs of procuring and storing
infrastructure. This means you are operating leaner, giving you strategic

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
170
and competitive advantages over many as you leverage your new and
improved cloud enabled business model. In fact, you can start operating
along the lines that large data centers and excess resources are really not
necessary for you any more as a consumer of cloud services. This “infra-
structureless” model allows you to try out innovations in new and
emerging markets faster, and it adds to your green objectives such as
reduced power, overhead, and waste.
Digitization, which is at the core of cloud computing, continues to
have a profound impact in our world. Check writing was replaced with
online services and mobile services. Use of cash and a physical wallet are
both fading with the widespread adoption of mobile technology. Some
aspects are already happening today considering that you can check in at
airports using your mobile device, and soon you will be able to shop at
your favorite stores with the same experience, no credit cards and no
wallets.1 According to CNNMoney.com companies including Citi,
Google, MasterCard, and U. S. Bank are example service providers. In
essence, digitization of business processes using enablers such as cloud
allows you to conduct business with less on-hand inventory, attributing
to your lean business objectives.
It is possible that you will consume cloud services from multiple
providers, meaning the concept of federated2 clouds is in order. While
the implementation details relative to federation are seamless to you at
this stage, it is important for providers and systems integrators to share
their approach with your teams so that they are aware and can make
informed decisions relative to contract development and negotiations.
Typically in a distributed computing environment, a large proportion
of infrastructure capacity sits idle. The use of cloud allows for much
greater utilization of the infrastructure and thus reduces costs. During
peaks such as holidays, seasonal ads, or voter registration periods, where
more capacity is required, larger virtual instances can be provisioned and
then de-commissioned after elections. You will see in the case studies in
the appendix that at times up to 300% return on investments were
achievable with reductions in labor costs and capital expenditures.
The transitional topics discussed in this section should be considered
as you develop your enterprise cloud adoption strategy as guiding prin-
ciples, and lean, agile concepts as described in the “Speed, Rapid
Development, and Service Delivery” section should be incorporated.
Following are lessons learned from project experiences that should be
considered as you plan your transition to cloud.

7: Planning the Transition
171
Practical Experiences and Lessons Learned
This section describes specific enterprise transition planning activi-
ties and considerations that should be reflected in your enterprise cloud
adoption strategy. The experiences are shared to emphasize the value of
implementation planning such as:
■Establishing proof of concepts and pilot programs
■Organizational change including addressing legacy environments and
applications
■The importance of matching business workloads to appropriate cloud
delivery models
■Outsourcing considerations
■Buyer/seller experiences
■Test strategy considerations
Proof of Concepts and Pilot Programs
Proof of concepts and pilot projects help you determine the suitabil-
ity of your organization for cloud. For instance, after conducting a suc-
cessful pilot rollout of remote desktops, a client concluded that the
organization was ready for strategic launch of desktop cloud solutions
with multiple teams leading the charge because of their knowledge and
gained experiences. What a great opportunity to demonstrate thought
leadership and drive the corporate remote strategy. This example is not
intended to imply, however, that all pilot initiatives run smoothly as in
this same example there were endorsement issues at executive levels that
directly contributed to rollouts spanning longer than the teams had
hoped. Nevertheless, positive outcomes included incremental transfor-
mations and productivity improvements. The point being that you
should identify pilot opportunities as a part of your transition planning
while at the same time leveraging your experiences from piloted or proof
of concept efforts to influence your transition.
Organizational Change
The following principles should be incorporated in your enterprise
cloud adoption strategy to guide transition planning:

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
172
1. Establish mutually beneficial contracts.
2. Establish integrated supplier (provider) management.
3. Establish integrated change management.
The need to establish contracts between consumers and providers is
obvious, so why call out specifically that your contracts should be mutu-
ally beneficial; isn’t the objective simply to have cloud services provided
as cheaply as possible? The point is that, unless there is mutual incen-
tive to continuously optimize workloads running in the cloud, your
providers have no reason to offer assistance or advice for more efficiencies
or optimization. The question becomes, “Are you treating your provider
as a commodity or a business partner?” Now for standardized workloads
that really have been commoditized, there might not be the need for
shared incentives; however, for mission critical components, care should
be taken to set up contracts appropriately or quality and cost efficiency
will deteriorate over time. Mutually beneficial contracts can mitigate a
wealth of problems that could occur and hinder your cloud adoption,
and as such explicit contract suggestions are provided in Chapter 6,
“Mitigating Risk.”
As a consumer, you might be of the opinion that by using cloud, the
need to focus on the operational aspect of your business will go away.
Clearly the labor required to run specific workloads that are now cloud-
sourced is eliminated; however, there is a need for establishing and
maintaining integrated supplier (or provider) management3 to at a mini-
mum monitor and continuously evolve business relationships. It is
important for you to understand that the scope of integrated supplier
management in the context of this book involves building stronger con-
nections with providers and augmenting traditional IT operational skill-
sets with leadership and management considering that as you divest
yourself of resources due to cloud-sourcing, you might need to train your
existing resources for new skill-sets or hire subsequent resources that can
manage your providers.
Change management is the continuous process of aligning an organi-
zation’s people and culture with business change, as illustrated in Figure
7.3. As mentioned in Chapter 6, effective change management is a form
of risk mitigation that addresses minimizing negative cloud adoption
experiences.

Effective change management mitigates risk.
Changes should be planned and integrated across cloud consumer and
provider domains to maintain business continuity and to prevent service
quality issues. This is important in cases where a service is completely or
partially developed within the organization of the cloud consumer.
Integrated change management is also necessary whenever there is
opportunity for a change in your provider’s environment that adversely
impacts services that may be critical to your business operations and
productivity.
Addressing legacy processes, applications and environments should
always be considered when developing your transition plans. For exam-
ple, a recent experience with a large enterprise required coordination of
corporate release schedules with the deployment of a provider’s cloud-
based data center that commenced with virtual test environments. We
ran into a few challenges due to aging applications that could not be
deployed to the virtualized environments and some applications were
ineligible for retirement due to complex processing (specifically dated
application libraries) that had been running for years, and the thought of
change generated a fear of unrecoverable business disruption. The good
news is that we were able to identify such issues early on due to prelimi-
nary legacy analysis and build in contingencies. While there were some
exceptions, release coordination and adequate contingency planning
enabled enterprise consumers to optimize use of the new cloud test envi-
ronments and drive quality throughout the organization with fewer
resource requirements.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
174
On another engagement, attempts to virtualize application develop-
ment and test environments were initially unsuccessful because of the
omission of the operations teams (individuals who run the data centers
and maintain the software) in the decision making processes when devel-
oping the cloud adoption strategy. One issue was that current tools were
dated and therefore unable to track what is in a cloud image, which
would make configuration management nearly impossible (software
upgrades, patches, etc.). Another issue was that the people who manu-
ally build development and test environments through the use of shell
scripts and so on were in no way compelled to change their processes. In
this example, course correction was inevitable. When it comes to legacy
applications, SaaS tends to be a common point of consideration, but it is
the underlying application architecture that enables SaaS capability.
This in itself is why each domain of your enterprise architecture must be
considered when it comes to cloud adoption.
Here are relative highlights of the revised, three-year enterprise cloud
adoption strategy that encompasses implementation planning for an
internal “private” cloud:
■Derived considering the expertise and inputs of the business, IT, and
operations teams
■Incorporates current corporate release schedules for systems and infra-
structure changes
■Includes a “target state” roadmap with prioritization, where the first two
months entail resource upgrades (people, process, information, and tech-
nology) to get to end of job
■Contains a deployment strategy for moving environments to an
upgraded, cloud data center
■Considers components of legacy applications that can be cloud enabled
such as the data tier rather than excluding an application in its entirety
■Incorporates incentive plans for leveraging cloud resources first as
opposed to building solutions in-house
■Contains an iterative release or “rollout” schedule for the organization
that includes training and guidelines for using the environment, while
concerted efforts are taken to minimize the business impacts and end user
experiences

7: Planning the Transition
175
When it comes to cloud considerations, your speed and throughput to
the cloud should be considered, which involves evaluating your own
equipment and devices as they could contribute to delays in processing
and service interruptions. Consider the following:
Jan uses high speed Internet services from a cable provider in her
home office. Lately she has observed noticeable delays when trans-
mitting data using Internet services in addition to unplanned serv-
ice outages. At one point she thought delays were due to her “in
home” wireless router considering that it was quite dated, and while
a contributing element, she soon discovered that the real issue was
her communication service provider’s (CSPs) continuous mainte-
nance at inopportune times. Unfortunately, this impacted her abil-
ity to work productively at home so while she upgraded her wireless
router, she also switched carriers.
In this example, had Jan decided to consume cloud services prior to
switching carriers, she would have experienced the same frustrations
with Internet performance issues and service interruptions because they
stemmed from her (or her CSP) and not the cloud provider.
As a consumer, you might be wondering, “Why should I care about
the network, as I am just consuming services from someone else’s cloud
environment?” In general, the performance of your network, adequate
bandwidth, and so on, is taken for granted, but that should not be the
case. Someone else’s cloud environment might not be on premise any-
more but it is also your environment. You should be careful to evaluate
your infrastructure to ensure that it will support increased capacity and
the anticipated business outcomes during transition planning. Here are
some example network-specific consumer-based transition planning
activities and considerations that were derived from project experiences:
■Wireless network coverage and expansions that extend coverage across
campuses with guest network and appropriate security
■Remote access services to provide a highway for bringing your own tech-
nology and remote worker campaigns
■Data center optimization with new network core and planned server farm
migrations for added security and control
■Preparation of use cases for network upgrades to support Internet capac-
ity and growth due to cloud business consumption

176
Workload Considerations
Proper matching of workloads with possible cloud delivery models
must be initiated before implementation planning commences to avoid
inappropriate downstream decisions and before any unrealistic delivery
expectations become prematurely locked into the mindsets of key stake-
holders. This is particularly true for providers and systems integrators if
you are working with tactical organizations that have no time for any-
thing but the job at hand.
NOTE
Providers, if you agree solely to offering infrastructure services to
consumers, then that is exactly what they will expect. Be careful in your
communications, without which, you will have a harder time getting
consumers to look “up the cloud stack” even though you might realize
that other cloud service types and additions such as governance, business
process automation, and so on are needful to fulfill service commitments.
This notion of matching workloads with cloud delivery models is just
as important for consumers. As you plan your transition, you should
work with enterprise stakeholders as early as possible and jointly with
providers to discuss workloads that can be cloud-sourced. Chapter 4,
“Identifying Cloud Candidates,” describes approaches for identifying
cloud opportunities that are driven from a business perspective to guide
companywide or at best comprehensive decision making.
As depicted in Figure 7.4, the more mission critical a service, the
higher the quality of service (QoS) requirements, which generally leads
to private cloud consumption. Security concerns are often nonnegotiable
and can be legally mandated. This is certainly an area of cloud transi-
tioning that you do not want to overlook or ignore. Although mentioned
in this chapter, Chapter 6 provides more detailed discussions on miti-
gating risk, including practices to mitigate security breaches.

Outsourcing Considerations
Relying on external cloud providers is in many ways similar to out-
sourcing IT operations. Historically, many outsourcing deals have gone
awry because the organization receiving outsourced services did not
implement the necessary organizational changes to ensure QoS for entire
contract durations. Recall that outsourcing deals are generally much
longer in duration, and the perception is that you are locked into agree-
ments that can cause outsourcing providers to become complacent in
delivery, especially once the excitement has worn off (this is certainly
not always the case, but it does happen). However, cloud’s rent-style,
shorter term contracts enable you to start and stop services quickly; it is
your choice and is a motivator for providers to meet and exceed QoS
commitments.
You might be wondering, “What is the difference between planning
your transition to cloud as opposed to planning your transition to a tra-
ditional outsourced provider?” If you think about it, in an outsourced
situation you transfer services and assets to a service provider. In a cloud
setting, you rent services and assets from a service provider. So from a
transition planning perspective, you still need to prepare contracts,

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
178
establish service level agreements, and be prepared to conduct business
on your own or with the help of other providers once your contract ends.
In an outsourced situation, you have an option to transfer permanent
ownership of your assets and services to your provider; by contrast, while
in a cloud setting you never owned the assets or services, so instead your
task is to figure out what to do with rented or leased assets. Do you
renew contracts? Should you invest in in-house purchases? Furthermore,
you need to determine the right time for making and communicating
such decisions. In an outsourcing situation, you might want to commu-
nicate such decisions early on with your providers to at a minimum
maintain effective business relationships; by contrast with cloud, such
communications are not required because arrangements are contract cen-
tric with fewer opportunities for human interactions. On the other hand,
your transition considerations should always be discussed and firmed
with your implementation teams.
Buyer and Seller Considerations
An area of opportunity in transition planning is the inclusion of
buyer and seller perspectives. This, of course, has a direct correlation to
your end user experiences because buyers need to know what to look for
and how to pursue cloud investments, and sellers need to be able to
effectively communicate cloud offerings.
The previous section discussed the essentials of balancing flexibility and
standardization in the form of café-style cloud service offerings. To continue
the discussion, buyers expect solutions that will meet their business needs.
They generally are not interested in the bells and whistles and instead appear
focused on solving business problems. Therefore, sellers need to know and be
able to effectively communicate the personalization aspects of cloud adoption
relative to business needs, while both buyers and sellers should be involved in
cloud deployment initiatives so that you produce the right mix of standard-
ized, yet personalized offerings.
Buyers want to know that providers understand their market and the
potential of cloud undertakings on the organization. As with any invest-
ment, they care that cost takeouts will continue and that business will
evolve or expand as a result of the investment, and they expect sellers to
partake in investments. From an implementation perspective, buyers
appear most interested in the amount of time it will take before they are
able to start using the cloud services in addition to rapid return on

7: Planning the Transition
179
investments. Suggestions on what to expect of providers when it comes
to faster time to market were discussed earlier in the “Speed, Rapid
Development, and Service Delivery” section.
If you are a cloud service provider and you receive a request for work
that encompasses cloud-specific requests, you need to ask the question
“who is the buyer?” and, if possible, connect with them. In this example,
the buyer refers to the person(s) who will ultimately pay and be respon-
sible for cloud service adoption. Why does this matter? Buyers (not the
process or the procurement specialists) are most likely experiencing an
element of pain that is driving pursuits that are greater than what is
expressed in Request for Information and Proposals (RFI/RFPs).
Knowing who will ultimately pay for and is responsible for cloud
services is significant as it helps you build a valuable and winning
response. In this example, you might be tempted to focus on your solu-
tion offerings (which other vendors probably have as well); however, if
your buyer is pursuing cloud explicitly for a purpose (for example, test
cycles are complicated and require inordinate amounts of time to
execute, or data centers are nearing capacity), then you need to specifi-
cally address those needs in your response. Yes, by all means include
your offerings, but focus on the value that you bring to address the prob-
lem first, such as faster delivery of quality products and services at
reduced costs than traditional means with reduced capacity.
The point is that buyers might not know exactly what they need, but
they do know what they are experiencing and how much they are willing
to pay for cloud services. Your challenge is to generate a winning
response that emphasizes capability first as it relates to the consumer
and then price.
Be careful to assure that buyers and sellers understand how to com-
municate the value of cloud adoption. Too often, sellers have expressed
that the benefits of cloud adoption are difficult to communicate without
getting into technical details. This usually occurs because they are
engaged too late in the product development and communications
processes to understand the business rationale and drivers behind the
cloud offering. Buyers need to understand what to look for in cloud
providers as well as their solution offerings and therefore should engage
early in the cloud adoption life cycle.

180
Test Strategy Considerations
Key to implementation planning is determining your test strategy as
you will need to validate that cloud services selected will perform
according to your expectations (your business units and IT) and will not
disrupt your current business operations. The degree of testing will vary
depending on the scope and magnitude of your project. The following
are some strategic considerations that you can reference as a checklist for
developing your master test strategy:
■Determine test and quality assurance stakeholder roles and 
responsibilities
■Determine test management and automation tools requirements and
develop an acquisition strategy
■Define and secure test environments at the appropriate locations (on or
off premise depending on your cloud adoption strategy)
■Expect that cloud solutions are thoroughly tested prior to your use. This
includes interfaces to other cloud services or commercial off the shelf
(COTS solutions)
■Focus on capability and integration testing while conducting security
validations of cloud solutions (security considerations were addressed in
Chapter 6)
■Plan for data migration testing to the cloud as applicable
■Ensure that test cases are traceable to in-scope cloud workloads, use cases,
and business requirements
■Establish entry and exit cloud test cases
Enterprise Cloud Transition Plans and Roadmap
Examples
The following illustrations depict three practical examples of transi-
tion planning activities. Figure 7.5 contains excerpts from an enterprise
cloud adoption roadmap that extended 2.5 years for a financial services
client whose cloud position was to operate as a consumer and provider of
internal cloud services with the possibility of adopting public cloud
services in the future.

Example cloud adoption roadmap
The very nature of cloud adoption required review and possible
refinements to corporate policies and was taken into consideration. In
this particular case, the enterprise cloud adoption strategy is horizontal
(cross business unit impacts) with initial emphasis on Desktop-as-a-
Service, chargeback models, and a data center strategy. SaaS applications
are expected to run on private PaaS environments, and enterprise appli-
cations are planned for internal and external public cloud adoption.
Corporate policies were reviewed for determining partner roles and in-
house security when joint cloud initiatives were underway, as well as to
derive internal billing and invoicing strategies.
To the far left is a depiction of the cloud ontology or “stack,” and to
the far right is a mapping of EA high level domains that were reviewed
to influence cloud adoption decisions as well as to determine impacts of
the adoption on the enterprise. As discussed throughout this book, a
best practice is to update the EA so that cloud adoption guidelines and
practices are standardized in your company. EA updates were a critical
success factor for this client as a driver of integrated organizational and
technology changes.
What is notable about this client’s view on EA is the vertical repre-
sentation of the business architecture (BA). The perspective is that BA

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
182
influences all domains of EA and should therefore be considered when
making decisions in each of the areas. The same is applicable to cloud.
Your BA (which represents your business processes and BPaaS) will have
influence on SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and governance so be sure to consider
these points as you think through your strategy.
Figure 7.6 shares portions of the financial services transition plan to a
green data center. The plan was an outcome of the enterprise cloud adop-
tion strategy work depicted in Figure 7.5. In this example, the adoption
of cloud is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions,
promoting the company’s green data center agenda which is depicted in
the IaaS layer of the roadmap. The detailed implementation plan is proj-
ect specific and includes roles, responsibilities, timelines, and approved
tasks where the transition plan outlines high level activities that should
carry forward into the project plan.

Summary
This chapter provided transition planning considerations and example
roadmaps to support development of your enterprise cloud adoption
strategy. The motivation was to share practical experiences because the

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
184
transformative nature of cloud and services adoption varies depending on
your business requirements.
The “business of cloud” was discussed along with analogies to tradi-
tional computing and outsourcing as well as the implications for enter-
prise operations. You also learned about strategically managing and
integrating change as well as the necessity of insights into information
and the experiences of others to prepare you for a successful and rapid
transition to cloud.
It is important for buyers to effectively communicate their business
requirements and financial commitments up front and match that to
provider offerings. Providers on the other hand are accountable to meet
buyers’ expectations. Correspondingly, some strategies were incorpo-
rated to facilitate positive buyer and seller experiences.
Lessons learned and practical experiences were an intentional focus in
this chapter because when it comes to transition planning the process is
not scientific and often the learnings of others can be the secret sauce for
your success. As such, example transition plans, roadmaps, and imple-
mentation considerations were provided for your reference. The next
chapter emphasizes the financial considerations and enables you to pre-
pare business cases specific to your environment.

Dan is a chief technology officer (CTO) for a business division in Brand,
Inc., a midsized global company. He has been invited to present his ideas for
moving Brand forward with cloud adoption to the chief financial officer (CFO)
and the chief operating officer (COO). Considering the audience, Dan realizes
the focus should be on the financial implications of cloud and that conversations
should include but go beyond current in-house conversations that emphasize the
pay-per-use benefits. Dan also realizes that the CFO and COO take direction
from the CEO and want to make the CEO’s strategic imperatives realized as
quickly as possible. Dan knows that some business units have adopted cloud to
address minor business needs, and he plans to leverage such insights along with
economic indicators to support his business case. Dan organized topics for present-
ing his business case, which this chapter amplifies, as follows:
1. Discuss the financial implications of having and not having an
enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
2. Dan realizes that it is appropriate to share his strategy to drive more
efficiency in managing costs and his vision to reduce both capital
expenditures (CAPEX) such as asset purchases and operational

186
expenditures (OPEX) or day-to-day expenses such as production
support and maintenance of acquired assets. Although financial
analysis is not Dan’s profession, he will discuss correlations to the
income statement and balance sheet where appropriate.
3. Describe techniques that were and can be applied to measure the
impacts of cloud adoption with an emphasis on financial risk miti-
gation, time to market improvements, profitability, and cost benefit
analysis.
Communicating the Financial Benefits and Implications
The adoption of cloud is reported as a facilitator of global job growth over
the next five years1 in places such as the European Union. Although this is
good news and considering that the economic outlook is growing more favor-
able each day, it should not be surprising to find your company operating
more cautiously when it comes to undertaking new business endeavors. C-
suite stakeholders are consistently enforcing required justifications for invest-
ments in business technologies. Even though cloud adoption is on the rise,
you must be prepared to communicate the financial implications of cloud
adoption as well as your success strategies.
Your ability to capture and relay the financial implications of con-
ducting business with and without a strategy is prudent and will
strengthen your business case for moving forward with execution of your
enterprise cloud adoption strategy. This chapter explores key financial
considerations that should be communicated as well as incorporated into
your EA for current and downstream project effectiveness. The opening
scenario with the CTO from Brand, Inc., will be elaborated to help
quantify topics covered in this chapter.
Some notable benefits realized from the adoption of cloud are a reduc-
tion in capital expenditures and lowered unit costs. Figure 8.1 (lower
bar) acknowledges that there are financial benefits with no EA strategy
in place, but the results are unpredictable and might not be the optimal
solution for addressing your business needs. However, if you strategi-
cally plan your adoption with an intent of reaching corporate business
objectives, reduce (not just shift) both capital and operational expendi-
tures, and optimize cloud investments across your company, the benefits
are more profound and predictable (upper bar).

It is important to capture both tangible and intangible benefits when it
comes to communicating the value of your enterprise cloud adoption
strategy. A tangible cloud benefit can be measured easily in dollars and
with certainty while an intangible benefit cannot be measured easily in
dollars or with certainty. Table 8.1 is an example benefits worksheet for
Brand. This worksheet will be used as inputs for the financial business
case summarized in Table 8.3 at the end of this chapter. You can find more
elaborations of benefits in relation to specific case studies in Appendix B,
“Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions.”

tive intelligence, enabled with cloud.
Easy to connect and integrate resources across,
within, and between clouds and enterprises.
Faster business growth and expansion due to
reduced barriers to entry (costs and duration)
required to expand business operations.
Improved employee morale and willingness to
experiment and “step out of the box” of tradi-
tionalism due to employee education, training,
and human resource commitments to support
the transition to cloud.
Improved business agility and continuous
process improvements will result in fewer
merchandise returns and discounts due to
strategic replacement of manual, error prone,
and redundant business processes with
proven, reusable cloud business solutions and
enablers.
Timely, strategic information expedites future
cloud adoption business decisions so that the
value of the cloud service portfolio continues
to grow in a strategic versus haphazard 
manner.
Improved time to value of solution delivery
(e.g., requirements determination, develop-
ment, and testing) due to adoption of ready
made cloud solutions that augment or
replace existing business and IT processes
and capabilities.
Green efficiencies (power, waste, carbon emis-
sions) due to cloud adoption.
The following are some key financial considerations that will help
you prepare and communicate your business case followed with in-depth
elaborations in the following areas:
■Managing your money
■Communicating opportunity costs
■Associating cloud workloads and business profitability
■Deriving return on investment (ROI) metrics
■Determining metrics and agility indicators
■Understanding time value of money (TVM) and net present value (NPV)

8: Financial Considerations
189
Managing Your Money
As suggested by the corporate executive board in its review of the
future of corporate IT, you can expect that increases in the percentage of
company spend to vendors will continue as cloud applications and infra-
structure adoption persists.2 This business trend is evident today as
companies move from adopting cloud at the edge of the enterprise (to
address business requirements that are not critical) to using cloud for
mainstream business processes, enterprise applications, infrastructure,
application development, and innovation.
While consumers are finding the use of cloud important for solving
both business critical and noncritical requirements, this background is a
reminder that just as it is important to manage consumer/provider rela-
tionships, as was emphasized in prior chapters, it is imperative that con-
sumer executives and other business stakeholders control and manage
their money wisely such that every dollar spent is spent for the right
reasons and in the right direction (as depicted in Figure 8.2). In fact,
this was an executive’s primary objective for developing the enterprise
cloud adoption strategy on a client engagement where we examined the
EA to determine the highly prioritized strategic initiatives and posi-
tioned the adoption of cloud accordingly. Your enterprise cloud adop-
tion strategy, derived from EA, generates cloud roadmaps and
downstream projects granting you better insights, management, and
control of where and how your money is spent.

Cloud computing affords the opportunity to reallocate funds for
innovative, competitive advantage (investments and activities) instead
of spending money on costly collateral or for capital equipment that
could easily end up underutilized. Does it make sense to insist on a pri-
vate cloud, which involves investment costs to build and configure your

190
cloud environment, when the applications and data (for example collab-
oration and funds allocation systems) are classified as public and there
are relative services ready for you to consume?
You must also take into consideration the level of effort required to
develop and execute your enterprise cloud adoption strategy that can range
from 6 to 10 weeks. The amount of resources depends on the complexity and
scope of the initiative. For instance, if you are focusing solely on infrastruc-
ture transformation then the number of resources are less than if you are con-
sidering both data and infrastructure cloud-sourcing.
If strategically planned, you have the opportunity to manage oppor-
tunity costs (discussed in the upcoming section, “Do Opportunity Costs
Matter?”) and contribute positively to your overall profit margins (the
ratio of net income to net sales, which is generally expressed as a per-
centage) by steering spending toward cloud assets that add value to your
organization for the short and long term. Capital preservation is also
likely with cloud adoption.
There are costs that you should discuss with stakeholders and incor-
porate into your strategy as guiding principles for cloud adoption. You
should, for example, explicitly specify viable pricing options that are
acceptable for your company as well as those that are off limits. Example
pricing options3 are as follows:
■Pay per use: Rates scale up and down depending on cloud usage. Two
common aspects of this model are typical for consumers: 1) You sub-
scribe to the cloud services that you need and pay at a designated point
in time (e.g., monthly); or 2) charges are metered to precisely match
usage down to the millisecond, and you are charged accordingly.
Referencing the opening business scenario, Dan is leaning toward the
subscription based service model as a recommendation for Brand, Inc., as
this model better aligns with the company’s budgeting and forecasting
processes and he likes that Brand would not be locked into a long-term
contract or encouraged to buy more capacity than is required for dis-
counted rates.
■Pay per number of concurrent online users: This model is most suit-
able for global businesses with multiple groups of employees who work
at different times in different locations.
■Pay for unlimited clients: You do not need to know how many licenses
you will need because the licenses are unlimited.

8: Financial Considerations
191
■Pay per seat: This is the traditional pricing mechanism where con-
sumers pay a rate per license, and vendors offer deals for volume pur-
chases but might also include penalties for reducing the number of seats
before contract renewal.
Types of Costs to Consider
Some cost types that should be considered when evaluating total
costs of cloud adoption, each of which should be analyzed prior to and
during contract negotiations, include the following:
■Fixed
■Variable
■Direct
■Indirect
■Hidden
■Tangible
■Intangible
■Recurring
■One-time
The cost of doing business is your fixed costs. These are costs that
you can expect to pay for the very existence of your business, they
remain fairly constant, they are time related (for example weekly,
monthly), and they remain in effect until a management decision is
made to change. Some example fixed costs are capital expenditures such
as data center rent or loan payments; or the purchase of required equip-
ment to run your business such as hardware and software. Another
example of a fixed cost is up-front payment to providers for services to
be rendered. These up-front costs are more prevalent in traditional out-
sourcing environments or for investing in and setting up on-premise
cloud environments.
Variable costs are optional and can change depending on sales (pay
for what and when you actually consume services) and volumes (where,
for example, discounts are offered to cloud consumers for repeat busi-
ness or large quantity purchases). Unlike traditional outsourcing, where
up-front costs to providers are expected, in a cloud-sourcing situation

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
192
you can specify fixed options, which might work better with your budg-
eting processes or you can select variable options and pay for services
when and based on what is actually consumed.
Dan discovered that 15 percent of IT-specific spending is associated
with maintaining complex applications and infrastructure due to system
redundancies and no business information model or master data manage-
ment (MDM) strategy. He concluded that the variable costs associated
with these issues are hindering Brand’s capability or willingness to
expand business operations because the implications of mergers and
acquisitions are difficult to assess and systems integration processes are
elongated due to poor quality of data and inconsistent usage of data and
systems across geographies.
Direct costs are usually variable in nature and can be specifically asso-
ciated with cloud adoption. Example direct costs are the labor costs
incurred to develop and execute your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
Costs directly tied to producing or consuming cloud services such as
educating employees to select cloud providers or setting up performance
dashboards to monitor the impacts of cloud on your organization are
examples of direct costs.
Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. These costs are gener-
ally referenced as overhead and can be difficult to tie directly to cloud
adoption. Example indirect costs are salaries for administrative staff,
charges for Internet services, and property taxes.
You should incorporate guidelines that help stakeholders avoid hid-
den costs as they can and will eat away at your profits. Hidden costs are
expenses that are not included in the purchase price of cloud offerings.
Some examples are unexpected provider price escalations, or the finan-
cial impacts of risk occurrences such as system downtimes, which can
include lost sales and employee overtime compensation.
As a part of his homework in ensuring that cloud adoption will add
value to Brand, Dan discovered what he terms “profit leakages,” which
are activities that siphon away the company’s profits. One area where
leakages are prominent is in the retail division where excessive discounts
and merchandise returns are the norm when it comes to managing cus-
tomer issues. These issues primarily stem from manual and/or inefficient
business processes that contribute to incorrect orders getting shipped to
customers. Dan understands that the use of a cloud-based point of 
sale (POS) system with integrated order management (OM) and loss 
prevention (LP) that(OM) and loss prevention is reusable across the retail

8: Financial Considerations
193
division could eliminate some significant hidden costs, including those
associated with merchandise that never gets returned.
Tangible costs are those that you can easily measure in terms of dol-
lars and with certainty. A cloud usage fee is an example tangible cost,
and likewise is the level of effort required to develop your strategy. If,
for instance, you decide to include storage as a service as a part of your
cloud adoption strategy, there are tangible costs associated with the
decision that can be measured.
Intangible costs are not easily measured in terms of dollars. An exam-
ple intangible cost is loss in employee morale due to concerns that the
use of cloud will eliminate his or her job, or in Dan’s case, the impacts of
one customer communicating to another her experiences when receiving
orders from Brand, Inc.
Recurring costs are those associated with the ongoing use and evolu-
tion of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. Example recurring costs
are renewal of cloud service contracts and costs associated with iterative
deployment of applications to cloud per your roadmap, which might
include application development or security services to ready applica-
tions for cloud. Referencing the opening scenario, Dan identified ad-hoc
projects as a benefit of developing an enterprise cloud adoption strategy.
This would streamline both recurring and one-time expenditures, which
are discussed next.
One-time costs are those associated with project startup and initia-
tion of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy. These costs typically
include activities such as network upgrades, team orientation, effort
expended to conduct executive interviews, and market research to deter-
mine the business value of incorporating cloud as a business technology.
NOTE
Unlike with SOA4 the one-time or startup costs for consuming public
clouds are reduced. This is primarily due to a shift from fixed to variable
cost models as described earlier. If your organization is currently
operating in a service-oriented capacity, there is increased probability that
the amount of time required to on-board stakeholders to a cloud-sourcing
model will be streamlined.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
194
Understandably, the amount of one-time costs and savings for private
cloud consumption is dependent on your internal capacity and pricing
strategies, but you can expect faster ROI and cost savings due to more
reliable charges for services rendered, more accurate chargeback models
that will (or should) emerge as enterprise best practices, and the under-
lying benefits of private cloud consumption that include price optimiza-
tion due to economies of scale.
Figure 8.3 illustrates projected benefits of private cloud consumption
for development and test activities—if strategically planned and exe-
cuted. To the left, IT spending is consistently on the incline while the
right side of the chart shows that with cloud adoption, there is a poten-
tial for reduction in annual (recurring) operating expenses by 43 per-
cent. The diagram also depicts the possibility of one-time cloud
deployment expenditures as discussed previously, although the amount
is not quantified. This business case was successfully presented to a
South African company. The case study is detailed in Appendix B.

Do Opportunity Costs Matter?
Yes. It is important to consider and communicate the opportunity
costs associated with enterprise cloud adoption as this emphasizes the
value and will influence prolonged usage of your strategy. Opportunity
cost is the cost related to the next-best foregone choice available among
choices. For instance, a person who decides to quit his job and go back
to school to increase his earnings potential has an opportunity cost equal
to his lost wages for the period of time he is in school. In Figure 8.3, the
opportunity cost of continuing business as usual is reduced annual costs
of IT operations by 43 percent—in other words, this is what was forgone
by not implementing a private cloud. Here are example opportunity
costs of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy:
■Lost revenues due to inability to anticipate and respond to market demands
■Increased vendor costs due to isolated business procurements (multiple
vendors paid for similar services and an inability to take advantage of vol-
ume discounts)
■Reduced profit margins due to hidden and unplanned support costs of
complex business infrastructure (people, process, information, technology)
■Lost customer revenues due to cloud-sourcing with no tangible or intan-
gible business benefits
■Financial penalties due to cloud information security breaches
Dan found that the value of lost opportunities due to development and exe-
cution of his proposed enterprise cloud adoption strategy are substantial,
equating to a 4.44 million increase in income for Division A, which is a 30
percent increase in forecasted revenues and a 20 percent increase from the
previous year’s actual performance. You can find elaborations of this analysis
in Table 8.2.
Cloud Workloads and Business Profitability
As mentioned in the previous chapter, in traditional data centers and
server farms it is normal to expect low utilization to capacity ratios of IT
assets. From a financial perspective, this contributes to return on invest-
ments that are not good, your debt to equity ratios are probably higher
than you would like, and your financial risk (the perceived uncertainty
of your ability to pay for financial obligations) is increased while your

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
196
risk tolerance levels are lowered. On the other hand, your enterprise
strategy provides you with intelligence so that you invest in cloud when
and where you need it, contributing to optimal capacity and utilization.
This, of course, mitigates your financial risk, increases your company’s
risk tolerance levels, and has the potential of strengthening both your
income statement and balance sheet.
Efficiencies associated with strategically planning and executing the
offload of business workloads to cloud is an example of taking steps to
positively impact your profitability. Profitability in this context means
contributing to positive net income (total revenues – total operating
expenses). By examining your entire business infrastructure through the
lens of EA (as depicted in Figure 8.4), you holistically determine cloud
business opportunities and you are more effectively able to simulate
business impacts on your organization.

Associating cloud workloads and business profitability

8: Financial Considerations
197
For instance, if a workload is not deemed suitable for cloud, then your
strategy presents alternatives such as traditional outsourcing, asset
retirement, or you might suggest leaving well enough alone and moving
forward with business as usual. If a workload is suitable for cloud, you
are able to examine your enterprise landscape and determine whether
any upgrades are required to support your decision or whether you can
use existing assets. The sooner you make such decisions the easier the
integration, which will save on rework and associated labor expenses
now and in the future.
Your EA also contains industry and regulatory requirements that you
can quickly reference to guide strategic cloud adoption decisions. For
instance, regulations such as Gramm-Leach Bliley (GLBA), Sarbanes-
Oxley (SOX), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)—
the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms
conducting business in the United States—require protection of cus-
tomer data and reporting of security breaches. You can reference such
guidelines to determine appropriate sourcing options (public, private,
hybrid, community, traditional outsourcing, or in-house sourcing) for a
designated workload.
Dan specifically sought out unit and item pricing stipulations along
with payment processing and privacy regulations for global operations.
He plans to validate compliance with cloud service providers upon
acceptance of his proposal.
In essence, strategizing the right workloads to outsource to cloud has
the potential to impact your profitability in three ways:
■It improves your income statement and balance sheet: In Figure 8.4
workloads A, C, D, F, and X were identified as cloud candidates (some
private and some public). Through review of the business architecture
(BA) it is determined that some workloads are disqualified from being
outsourced to cloud because processes are nearing retirement, while oth-
ers are critical to the business and require evaluation. This approach pre-
vents executives from spending time on initiatives that are of low
priority, which adds to wasted spend, while ensuring that downstream
projects add value to the business. Recall that your business strategy is
typically depicted as a part of your BA, and both should be leveraged to
understand your business processes and the strategic direction of your
company.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
198
Your strategy stimulates reduction in capital and operational expendi-
tures due to purchase of cloud assets as you need them along with pay-
ments for cloud services as they occur. Positive cash flows, less debt, and
avoidance of standing depreciation costs for what used to be carried as on-
hand capital equipment are some of the financial benefits. In essence, the
cost of doing business in the cloud has positive influence on both your
balance sheet (your net worth) and your income statement (your net
income).
■It mitigates financial risks: Examining your enterprise portfolio in the
manner depicted in Figure 8.4 allows you to better understand your busi-
ness and IT assets and integration points for cloud while governing your
portfolio enables you to better leverage your assets so that you effectively
use cloud now and in the future. Holistic analysis of your portfolio of
assets also contributes to faster and more effective business decisions rela-
tive to cloud adoption.
Dan researched and will recommend use of a hybrid idea management
system to stimulate ideas for improving business operations from internal
and external stakeholders. His suggestion is to commence with a public
cloud to gain insights into the public’s opinion on a retail-related subject
or idea (e.g., fashion merchandising), while managing differentiating
ideas that surface internally to mitigate the financial risks (e.g., legal fees)
associated with exposing confidential, intellectual property.
The adoption of cloud not only adds to your business elasticity by equip-
ping you to strategically plan growth and shrinkages but also reduces
your financial risk due to sustainable earnings and rapid business growth.
Your retained earnings for instance are positively impacted in that labor
and time savings can be monetized and used immediately or retained for
investments in future advancement of your business.
■It optimizes your ROI: Return on investment is the money that you
earn as a percentage of the total value of invested assets. ROI is calculated
by dividing your return on an investment by the cost of the investment.
There is ROI advantage in both private and public cloud adoption where
payback for investments is faster and costs are more precise than tradi-
tional sourcing.

Key ROI Metrics and Business Agility Indicators
ROI metrics are applied to measure the effectiveness of your enter-
prise cloud adoption strategy on your business performance while busi-
ness agility indicators5 measure your potential for success currently and
in the future. The following are some key ROI metrics, each of which
has influence on your financial performance and takes into account cloud
adoption with and without your strategy:
■Percentage of profit margins that stem from cloud adoption
■Percentage of savings in capital and operational expenditures
■Percentage of savings due to green efficiencies (for example, power con-
sumption, water usage, carbon emissions)
■Percentage of reduced cycle costs from ideation to implementation
■Percentage of reduced costs due to business process outsourcing to cloud
■Percentage of costs eliminated due to cloud adoption
■Rate of cloud adoption
■Annual spend (categories and amount) before and after execution of your
enterprise cloud adoption strategy
As mentioned in Chapter 2, “Business Value of Incorporating Cloud
into Your EA,” your business agility has a positive influence on your
business performance. This includes your financial performance because
the more agile your company, the greater your ability to anticipate mar-
ket demands. Here are some key agility indicators that are applicable to
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy and, of course, you would tailor
for your specific business scenario:
■Time to identify differentiating market opportunities
■Time to make cloud decisions
■Time to integrate cloud into your business strategy
■Ability to predict growth in target markets with certainty
■Time from strategy to execution
■Time to collaborate across supply channels
■Time to respond to business events and change

200
Time Value of Money (TVM) and Net Present Value (NPV)
With the adoption of cloud, you can expect your benefits to accrue in
the near term as well as in the future, and therefore it is significant to
understand both TVM, which is the process of comparing present cash
outlays (your goal is to minimize this amount) to future returns, and
NPV, which is the discounted value, as of a specified date, of future cash
inflows less all cash outflows. In essence, you want to understand the
present value (today’s dollar value) of your expected, future cash inflows
that result from your investment in cloud, keeping in mind that if the
NPV of your potential cloud undertaking is positive, it is a good indica-
tor of positive cash flows, and if the NPV is negative, you should think
carefully about this undertaking since the cash flows generated from
your cloud investments are most likely negative. The formula for find-
ing the present value of X dollars received in “t” years from now when
“r” is the discount rate is depicted in Figure 8.5.
present value =
$X
(1 + r)t
Figure 8.5
Formula for computing present value
You derive the overall NPV by summing the PV amounts for each
year. If, for instance, you choose to purchase cloud backup/retrieval and
disaster recovery services to prevent system outages and to avoid the
costs associated with extra disk storage and data center expansions that
are required to support your business’s growth, the overall NPV of your
cloud undertaking is positive and reflected in Table 8.2 as $6,355.4 pre-
suming the following:
■In Year 0, you will invest $1,000 in employee education and training on
how to use the cloud services.
■In Year 1, you will receive $4,000 total revenues.
■In Year 2, you will receive $4,500 total revenues.
■A discount rate of 10 percent is applied due to inflation.

Business Scenario: Brand, Inc.
Table 8.3 outlines elements of the business case Dan prepared for the
CFO and COO at Brand. Financial implications are specific to Division
A, the Retail Services division, with company-wide projections. Dan’s
approach is to discuss the financial implications of having and not hav-
ing an enterprise cloud adoption strategy; discuss correlations to the
income statement and balance sheet where appropriate; and describe
techniques to measure the impacts with an emphasis on risk mitigation
and profitability.
Dan shared the business potential of a 40 percent reduction in business
and IT combined capital and operational expenses and a $4.44 million
increase in net income and revenues over a 1.5 year timeframe. He expects
ROI to continue for several years while a majority will be realized in the first
year, and one of his key takeaways is the enterprise cloud adoption strategy
will focus on reducing financial risks through steady, increased business cash
flows and reduced debt by driving both up-front and capital costs down
while ensuring positive net working capital and operational efficiencies.
NPV is to be determined but presumed favorable.

Costs
(Current or projected
costs without enter-

Approximately 40% of enterprise spending can be eliminated or mar-
ginalized. Distribution is as follows:
15% of divisional spending is due to silo efforts and includes redun-
dant business processes, one-off application and infrastructure 
purchases, and manual processes that require staff augmentation for
quality control. An example manual process is the generation and
physical mailing of paper-based invoices. While these are direct costs
for Division A business operations, the costs are preventable.
15% of IT specific spending is associated with maintaining complex
applications and infrastructure; these variable costs are primarily due
to little or no standardization. For instance, there is no business infor-
mation model or master data management (MDM). This hinders
business expansion because the implications of mergers and acquisi-
tions are difficult to assess and systems integration processes are 
elongated due to geographical inconsistencies and complexities.
10% of costs are hidden and stem from system downtimes and 
customer related issues including excessive discounts and frequent
merchandise returns.
The remaining 60% of enterprise spending does not require change 
at this time.

Balance sheet and
income statement
(Balance sheet and

associations)
Balance sheet does not carry cloud solutions as capital since cost is
incurred when services are rendered. Large capital investments and
liabilities are reduced with the adoption of off-premise clouds and
efficient adoption and use of private clouds.
Increased cash flows anticipated from strategic cloud adoption adds to
income statement and retained earnings.
Income statement excludes depreciating capital expenses since none
are added with the adoption of off-premise clouds.
Operational savings generated now and over time from strategic cloud
investments are reflected as reduced expenses and positive net income.
Financial risks
(Risks and planned 
mitigations)
Paying only for what is used can mitigate the financial risk of uncer-
tainty as to whether Brand will receive a return on any individual
cloud investment, but it is the development and execution of an
enterprise cloud adoption strategy that further mitigates financial risk
by positioning Division A and other divisions to maximize payoff in
the short and long run through up-front, holistic cloud decision mak-
ing that aligns with business strategy; and through effective gover-
nance of the adoption (including standardization) to ensure
downstream project efficiencies continue to reduce costs while 
sustaining profits.

Summary
Be prepared to communicate your strategy and the financial implica-
tions to a range of stakeholders including your chief financial officer
(CFO). Three major lessons emerged from this chapter: First, key finan-
cial considerations that are required to build and maintain sponsorship
of your business case for cloud adoption should be articulated. Second,
ensure that financial considerations are supported by your EA so that
enterprise capability gaps are identified and prioritized, and budgets are
allocated and governed, respectively. Third, EA adoption of cloud
enables your transition and implementation planning to be successfully
realized while financial considerations are integrated into your EA so
that downstream cloud and related projects leverage the knowledge and
guidelines presented and your EA remains current.
Teams need to be mindful of reducing both capital and operational
expenditures and conducting cost benefit or economic feasibility analy-
sis. Key areas discussed in this chapter include strategies and techniques
for managing your company’s capital, the significance of opportunity
costs, cloud workloads and profitability analysis, ROI metrics, business
agility indicators, and understanding the time value of money (TVM)
and net present value (NPV) of your potential cloud investments. The
Brand business case shared how some of the key concepts in this chapter
can be applied to develop your business case for development and execu-
tion of your enterprise cloud adoption strategy.

Now What?
To fulfill its potential as the next evolution of enterprise IT, cloud
computing must become more than an enabler of IT efficiencies. It must
become a driver of business transformation. For some it will be about re-
engineering business processes like a retailer that needed a better way to
manage its global supply chain, one involving hundreds of partners,
thousands of locations, and a plethora of silo systems. A global cloud-
based supply chain standardizes and integrates disparate and largely
manual processes for tendering, contracting, and managing global 
transportation services. Benefits include increased collaboration and 
efficiency, greater contract compliance, improved decision-making, 
and enhanced visibility, which contributes to significant cost savings

differentiate and capture a greater market share. Specifically, a cloud-
enabled collaboration platform created an innovation hub where com-
pany employees and partners could engage during the development
process of new products and features increased the likelihood of market
success. Finally, some companies seek to build a whole new business
model like a financial services company that used the cloud to launch,
preserving capital while creating an entirely new business model in
mobile payments.
Your executive stakeholders, chief information officer (CIOs), chief
executive officer (CEO), and other C-suite executives, require teams that
can collaborate effectively such that strategic imperatives are chosen,
decisions are optimized, and pursuits for business solutions that create
outcomes that make a difference occur in your company. Every CIO still
has to deliver excellence in fundamentals such as usability, reliability,
and security. Figure E.1 illustrates visionary plans of CIOs to increase
competitiveness. The data is derived from a global CIO study conducted
by IBM where face-to-face conversations occurred with more than 3,000
CIOs worldwide, the first of a kind study with CIOs.1

other strategic assets considered for competitive advantage, many of
which will run more efficiently on a cloud platform. Business intelli-
gence and analytics remained at the top of the list while mobility and
virtualization followed. The use of virtualization was greater in 2009 in
comparison with 2011; business process management (BPM) remained
fairly steady, while interestingly risk management and compliance
declined in 2011. Self-service portals had a small decline while in
investment interests, while collaboration and social networking tools
remained fairly steady between the years 2009 and 2011. Each of the
capabilities presented will support your cloud investments and should
be considered as you develop your cloud adoption strategy.
As you reflect on previous chapters and review the case study pre-
sented in this epilogue, you know that new market segments and busi-
ness opportunities due to technological advances are there for the taking
and that you are or soon will be faced with competitive innovations that
will challenge your current state. You can expect to experience numerous
cloud offerings, and you will have to decide what is right and what is
not appropriate for your company. Some thoughts:
■Think about how you can leverage cloud to drive not only cost reductions
but how to leverage such capability to deliver high value services and for
some to differentiate yourself in the marketplace.
■Study your buying patterns and consider altering to accommodate chang-
ing business models albeit through the use of cloud or other delivery
models.
■Consider your business processes and contingencies in case cloud solu-
tions become unavailable, meaning contingencies beyond service level
agreements and service level objectives (SLAs and SLOs) that generally
take affect after the fact. For instance, what steps can you take to quality
assure cloud solutions before integrating into your business processes?
Are you positioned to discover potential issues before they become prob-
lems such as through the use of executive dashboards?
■Study your organization. How well do you collaborate, team, and co-cre-
ate, and what must you do to ensure that your cloud adoption decisions
return sustainable results? For instance, are you applying the same solu-
tion approaches and principles today that you did yesterday? If so, what
are the current and projected implications to your business performance?
Is it time for change?

This epilogue highlights the application of some key principles dis-
cussed in this book through the upcoming Project Gold case study—a
small- to medium-sized business (SMB) with approximately 250
employees and is derived from real experiences. To remain competitive
the “Sta-up” company researches the value of cloud and the implications
of adoption. A key business outcome is development of a strategic plan
and roadmap for moving forward. The rationale behind decisions is elab-
orated throughout for your edification and to stir creativity when it
comes to choosing your cloud adoption strategy.
Project Gold, an SMB Case Study
Stewart is vice president of product development and marketing at
Sta-up International, a global communications service provider (CSP)
company whose corporate headquarters is in North America. Stewart is
excited about the possibilities of using cloud as a vehicle to accelerate
introduction of new products and expand Sta-up’s market penetration in
South America. In a team meeting with other senior executives, Stewart
received executive endorsement to introduce public cloud services as a
part of the overarching CSP strategy as a differentiating business capa-
bility and service offering.
In his business case, Stewart cited some cloud adoption trends and the
white space that he observed, one of which is a need for cloud offerings for
SMBs in local, global, and emerging economies. In a follow-on session with
the team that he selected, Stewart provided directives and transformational
guidelines as follows:
■Strategic vision: Propel Sta-up to become the leading CSP public cloud
services provider in South America.
■Strategic Objectives:
■
Build a partnership business model with cloud service providers
that enables Sta-up to acquire, re-brand and offer cloud solutions
to existing and new international customers at attractive rates.
Include training of sales and marketing teams to effectively pro-
mote and maintain offerings.
■
Create an attractive, value-add set of offerings for both horizontal
and vertical markets.
■
Deliver a Sta-up branded cloud AppStore and a performing solu-
tion within six months that can be shared with end customers.
This cloud solution must integrate with existing enterprise

systems and support Sta-up’s brand of being #1 in the region 
when it comes to customer service.
Project Gold Strategy Team Organization
Figure E.2 illustrates the Project Gold team membership and organi-
zation. A summary of the roles and responsibilities follows. The team is
comprised of members from several business units within Sta-up
International and is led by Stewart.
As mentioned, Stewart is vice president of product development and mar-
keting. He is the executive sponsor and visionary leader of Project Gold.
Andy, chief information officer (CIO) teamed with Marsha (executive
product manager) and Peter (communications business area leader) to
understand cloud opportunities and the feasibility of consumption
within a Sta-up enterprise. Andy quickly decided that a workshop was
essential to pull the teams together for more collective intelligence. He
arranged an offsite meeting with stakeholders after two weeks of
research to analyze findings and discuss recommendations with Stewart.

David, chief technology officer (CTO) of cloud solutions and chief
enterprise architect, provided an enterprise view of the business and
technology landscape. David teamed with and provided insights to
stakeholders about existing and future enterprise requirements; he
worked closely with Andy and took the action to identify and develop an
integration strategy along with establishing an enterprise governance
framework. David is the primary liaison with cloud service providers.
Francine, chief financial officer (CFO), researched revenue sharing and pric-
ing options from both consumer and provider perspectives. She is focusing on
what the right model should be and how to integrate with existing Sta-up
business models so that the company benefits from any cloud undertakings.
Gabriena, vice president of corporate relations, legal and regulatory
compliance, provides advice and council on international business
including taxation, business continuity, and regulatory stipulations.
Gabriena is anxious to attend the workshop and has prepared current
regulatory requirements that are in effect today at Sta-up.
Marsha, executive product manager, took the action to determine
what services made the most sense to consume from the cloud. She began
by conducting market analysis for SMBs and internally she studied her
organizational capabilities including key business processes that might
be suitable for cloud augmentation and her IT service delivery processes
and current performance. She will use this data to influence selection of
one or more cloud solutions and service providers.
Peter, communications business area leader, researched cloud providers
that excel in CSP solution delivery in an effort to jump-start the selection
process should the decision be taken to move forward. Peter was concerned
about organizational impacts and changes required to become both a con-
sumer and provider. His focus was gaining the organization’s buy-in, and
along with Francine he focused on funding models and how to measure and
charge back service consumption to end users, a core benefit of cloud. Peter
recommended that a third party independent business consultant join the
team and soon hired Samuel to assist with strategic planning.
Samuel, third-party executive business consultant for Anchor, Inc.,
specializes in cloud service portfolio development for CSPs and interna-
tional market analysis. Samuel was selected by Peter. He will attend the
workshop as an independent cloud business strategist and subject matter
expert. Samuel will help the team determine what to look for in
providers, but he will not partake in cloud provider selection.

discussions. Recall in Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your Enterprise
Cloud Adoption Strategy,” that you need to know your own organization
so that you can effectively use cloud services. To do this you need to
determine areas to assess. In Chapter 3, Figure 3.3 suggested assessment
areas as checkpoints for ensuring that there is a common understanding
of your organization’s experiences and business capabilities so that you
make informed and situational business decisions.

Cloud Strategy Workshop Discussion Points and Key
Business Outcomes
Overall, the team agreed that operating as a value added reseller
(VAR) is suitable for Sta-up and would complement the CSP business
model and service offerings. Peter communicated that Sta-up already has
strong network (wireless, unified communications including voice,
video, and broadband) capabilities, a large client base comprised of SMB
customers, and the business savvy to provide and support individual or
bundled services. The company has shortcomings, however, in the areas
of IT delivery in that traditional development cycles are long and costly,
making cloud-sourcing a viable alternative for new product innovations
and enablement. The goal is to build up in-house capability by assisting
in development and testing efforts with selected providers. The team is
uncertain in its ability to acquire and re-brand cloud service offerings
within a six-month window and therefore developed a proposed two-year
timeline.
Service Catalogue a Hybrid of Bundled and Standalone
Solutions
Essentially, Sta-up will become a private consumer of cloud services,
meaning the cloud environment will be hosted in Sta-up’s data center in
a single tenant capacity. Sta-up will in turn resell select services as pub-
lic cloud offerings while taking advantage of the private cloud platform
to build internal skills and strengthen existing IT capabilities. This
approach requires strong collaborations with existing and new business
partners as well as a willingness of cloud service providers to share in the
risks and rewards. This model is required to support the new VAR-based
cloud delivery, and as the team expressed must transpire with a sense of
urgency.
During the session, Marsha led a discussion on market insights. She
reviewed the data that she researched relaying that public clouds are
popular for smaller businesses and that private cloud adoption emerged
in prior years and would continue to grow particularly in cases where
privacy and regulatory requirements dictate. She singled out the
Microsoft SMB Cloud Adoption Study 2011:
Those SMBs paying for cloud services will be using 3.3 services, up from fewer
than two services today; Eighty-two percent of SMBs say buying cloud services
from a provider with local presence is critical or important; 56 percent of

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
215
larger SMBs (with 51–250 employees) will pay for an average of 3.7 serv-
ices within three years. By 2014, (within 3 years) 43 percent of workloads
will become paid cloud services, but 28 percent will remain on-premises, and
29 percent will be free or bundled with other services.2
Marsha, an advocate of collective intelligence and gamification strate-
gies to facilitate learning and decision making, expressed that social net-
working, collaboration tools, online learning/training with techniques
such as serious gaming,3 customer relationship management (CRM),
hosted services, and data backups/disaster recovery are popular public
and private cloud workloads. Gamification in this context means the
augmentation of game mechanics in the work environment through
applications, products, and services to promote social interactions and
real-time business situations. She is interested in offering such capabil-
ity as SaaS solutions.
NOTE
Appendix B, “Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions,” contains a list
of case studies, and one in particular furthers the relevancy of serious
games and describes how integrating serious games and cloud was
effectively applied for a travel and transportation client.
Marsha had particular interests in data backups and disaster recovery
for Sta-up because they are important applications, yet are not consid-
ered business critical by many of the SMBs in the region. To broaden a
Sta-up service portfolio, she suggested that the company consider bun-
dled cloud offerings that include backup and recovery services since
bundling appears to be a buyers’ trend:4
For instance, we could offer infrastructure compute services that include SaaS
applications such as online financial accounting and tax services along with
the option to back up data to unlimited storage that we make available in our
cloud. That is a much more attractive suite than just offering infrastruc-
ture—and if you add to that the managed operations and hosted capability
that I know Francine will discuss, the service offering is that much more
inviting.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
216
David is in favor of this hybrid approach. He particularly knows and
appreciates the interest of SMBs in hosted services and that the approach
is typically taken due to internal shortfalls such as finances, infrastruc-
ture, or skills deficits. Sta-up is experienced in providing hosted services
internally through virtualization; however, there is a shortage of internal
cloud skills. This cloud opportunity will augment existing shortfalls.
Business Model Emphasizes Shared Risks/Rewards
Francine commented on the revenue model and pricing structure. She is
certain that a Web-based storefront with a hybrid of individual offerings as
well as bundles or packaged offerings combined with consumption based
pricing that enables users to pay only for the tools or services they need with-
out having to make any up-front investments is an attractive service offering.
While her experiences with traditional IT providers have been once solutions
are purchased it is up to the consumer to maintain, she is focused on driving
a shared risks and rewards strategy, which she views as the path for Sta-up to
reach revenue targets faster and for the provider to gain more client testimo-
nials with respect to cloud solutions.
Francine’s biggest concern is cost recovery. Because the team con-
cluded that internally the capability is simply not there and it would
take too long to build a cloud environment with existing business and
IT resources, Sta-up will be making an investment to adopt a private
cloud. Francine wants the return on the cloud investment to be positive
within the first year of operations, which means the reliance on in-house
sales teams with up and cross selling cloud experiences. She has an idea
of a cloud marketing and advertising campaign strategy for selected
providers that would drive recognition and continued use of Sta-up’s
cloud offerings.
To minimize costs, Francine suggested to the team to collaborate with
an already onboarded outsourcing provider (MZT Enterprises) that man-
ages Sta-up’s data center and IT operations in North America because
they also have operations in targeted South America markets. Francine
feels that the costs to Sta-up should be lowered because MZT is familiar
with the existing environments, international laws, and she is aware that
although the delivery team might differ, she has experienced MZT’s
service excellence, and they are known for proven cloud offerings and
experienced delivery.
Another financial area of discussion was revenue sharing. Francine
wants Sta-up to receive a markup of 20 percent for all services resold.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
217
She is hoping for a growth in customers by 50 percent due to the SaaS,
PaaS, IaaS, and bundled offerings over the next two years. If the cloud
portfolio stands, she predicts a customer growth rate of 30 percent for
years 1 and 2, and 20 percent in subsequent years.
Andy does not agree that MZT should be the choice cloud provider
and suggests that others be considered, stating, “We should consider
those providers that offer business intelligence and storage solutions as
this would be a welcomed addition to our service catalog.”
Cost Take-Out
In addition to revenue generated from new service offerings and busi-
ness growth, the team recognizes opportunities to eliminate costs associ-
ated with order management and the introduction of auto-approvals of
designated purchases. Traditionally, this process required written
authorizations as a part of the workflow, which introduced errors, unnec-
essary disputes, and delayed settlements. It is expected that the cycle
times for new product introduction will improve due to service automa-
tion and the rapid availability of applications and servers required to
support product initiatives as needed and on demand. The other area of
opportunity is the self-service order fulfillment process that replaces dis-
patching of field agents before a transaction is completed. Combined
with order management improvements cloud adoption is expected to
contribute to a 25 percent reduction in business processing and IT asso-
ciated costs.
Regulations Drive Private Cloud Adoption with Public Service
Offerings
Gabriena discussed existing corporate, industry and government issued
regulations that must be considered as a part of the cloud strategy as listed in
Table E.1. She is in support of a private cloud strategy, which will ensure that
Sta-up remains in compliance with local regulatory requirements and since
international capability is introduced she knows there are other considera-
tions such as the need to host cloud solutions in regional Sta-up data centers
with citizenship from the same countries. Gabriena requires that all the stan-
dards listed be revisited and augmented to support the expansion of business
in South America in order to move forward with cloud adoption and for final-
ization of the service offerings. She discussed the importance of these regula-
tions citing FDA policies and informing the team that life sciences workloads
running in the cloud must be validated in accordance with Good Practice

*Standards and compliance currently in operation at Sta-up. However, each listed standard
must be reevaluated and augmented in support of our cloud strategy and our growth in

Enterprise Integration and AppStore Standards
Gabriena is adamant that payment processing must occur through
Sta-up’s existing portal infrastructure that was shared by David, due to
established security protocols and compliance with enterprise data,
application, and infrastructure standards. She and David both insist on
using existing billing and credit card gateways on confirmation that
Sta-up is up to date with COBIT, HITECH, PCI, and SOX compliance
along with current enterprise security standards. David set the standard
for providers when it comes to interoperability stating that they must
generate open application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or Web
service interfaces for all cloud business functionality so that integration

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
222
with Sta-up’s existing systems including the portal is simplified and for
a smoother transition during on-boarding into the cloud environment
and upon exit.
As mobile devices such as tablets become more popular in the work-
place, Sta-up recognizes that employees should be allowed to load or
consume applications from their devices but do so in a controlled man-
ner. In David’s previous role as the chief enterprise architect, he led
development of policies for an in-house enterprise application store
(AppStore), which his EA team maintains.
The enterprise AppStore contains company approved and fully vetted
applications, many of which are publicly available, that were adopted
and recommended for business purposes. As David discussed, the same
principles are applicable to cloud adoption where (although in its early
stages) he maintains a list of approved cloud solutions and providers.
Storage-as-a-Service, for instance, is readily available for consumption
by numerous vendors; this solution, however, requires policies and
enforcements so that company data does not become exposed to the pub-
lic or susceptible to vulnerability attacks as a result of the adoption.
The EA team has developed procedures for adding and removing tools
from the enterprise’s AppStore and welcomes feedback on suggested or
available tools. For simplicity, in addition to AppStore standards, David
would like to have an integrated enterprise AppStore.
Service Desk Support
Sam reminded the team that while self-service is a benefit of cloud,
service desk support is highly recommended to support Sta-up’s current
track record of service excellence and as a strategy for identifying new
service offering opportunities based on customer demand. The ticketing
system should be integrated with the Web storefront for simplicity and
suggested service desk support as selection criteria when choosing cloud
providers. He shared a high level process of a ticketing system and stan-
dard performance metrics:
■Receive incoming Web, voice, and e-mail requests for support in three
international languages and English.
■Open a ticket.
■Record calls and inquiries.
■Assign level of severity.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
223
■Transfer calls or tickets to the appropriate support group.
■Initiate escalation for critical situations.
■Increase support levels if agents cannot resolve an issue.
■Measure and manage the quality of service with agent quality audits, root
cause analysis, and SLA monitoring.
Typical service desk performance measurements are as follows:
■Number of customer service requests received at help desk.
■Number of tickets opened.
■Number of tickets closed.
■The average time to respond to tickets (time between opening and the
first contact with the requester).
■The average time spent to resolve tickets.
Sustainability and Rewards
A key discussion point was organizational sustainability. Too often,
initiatives such as this take off with strong executive endorsements, but
as implementation nears, the endorsements dwindle. The team was con-
cerned that the same would transpire here and that the risks of such
occurrence would be harmful. Each of the strategic team members
agreed to remain involved throughout implementation as steering com-
mittee and hands-on subject matter experts. Outcome-based reward sys-
tems were discussed as a motivator to each of the leaders and
implementation teams. Examples include bonus alignment to the strate-
gic roadmap and key implementation milestones; Formal communica-
tions across the company in recognition of team contributions and first
of a kind asset development and delivery; and rewards for innovations in
business process improvements and cloud adoption strategies. Stewart
took the immediate action to institute this outcome-based reward sys-
tem with Human Resources.
Outcome-based rewards were also discussed in the context of select
providers and as a part of the shared risks/shared rewards strategy. A
critical success factor is to determine which measurements or leading
indicators are used to ensure that the outcomes are realistic and on track.
As mentioned, this approach will be discussed and negotiated with 

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
224
vendors; however, a key indicator will be consumption of the public
cloud offering and on-boarding of new customers. The team agreed that
measuring the outcomes at the appropriate times will generate the best
behaviors. If, for instance, measurements transpire at the end of the con-
tract, then it is too late to make appropriate course corrections, which
would somewhat defeat the purpose of an outcome-based reward model.
The team (David is the focal point) will work with providers to deter-
mine the appropriate processes as well as governance of the processes.
The following steps were outlined to sustain Project Gold, including
the outcome-based reward model:
1. Ensure that processes are established and properly followed.
2. Ensure that exceptions and undesirable outcomes are identified and
addressed in a timely manner.
3. Establish accountability throughout the entire process from strategy
through implementation.
4. Establish reporting and audit trail processes and execute.

Project Gold Cloud Requirements Framework and Strategic
Roadmap
Table E.2 describes the requirements for cloud services. The inte-
grated requirements and strategic roadmap was collectively developed
by the team during the workshop and shared with Stewart. After adding
service level targets Stewart approved the roadmap and authorized the
team to commence development of a Request for Inquiry and Quote
(RFI/RFQ) that will get disseminated to cloud service providers.
The requirements aspect of the framework indicates what services
make the most sense for Sta-up considering the strategic vision and
business objectives and will influence cloud provider selection. The
roadmap considers all information collected during the workshop begin-
ning with the questionnaire responses (refer to Figure E.3), require-
ments, gaps in capability, and transition planning, such as provider
selection and training of internal sales and marketing teams, and applies

this data to determine realistic delivery windows. As depicted in Table
E.2, projected delivery windows are Phase 1 (1-5 months), Phase 1b (6-
12 months), and Phase 2 (1-2 years). This strategic roadmap will evolve
and is expected to be updated once provider selection transpires.

David assigned ownership to each of the roadmap domains and will
validate, update, own, and integrate into the EA as cloud adoption stan-
dards. Reading from the bottom of Table E.2 to the top, the strategic
requirements are
1. IaaS compute and storage: These solutions are intended for SMB and
large enterprises and intended to jump-start revenue returns. It is
expected that Compute-as-a-Service (CaaS) can be delivered to cus-
tomers in three months. Storage offerings include backup, archive,
and recovery services that can be consumed on-demand or through
automatic provisioning of CaaS. Security services are a part of the
standard IaaS offering, and example capabilities are antivirus, threat
pattern recognition, and intrusion detection services. The owner of
this domain is David.
2. PaaS services include communications offerings such as voice and
video along and collaboration services such as unified messaging
enhancements, Web hosting, virtual desktops, and developer and
test environments: The intended consumers are small- and medium-
sized enterprises. The services are a part of Phase 1b to allow base
infrastructure cloud service components to be put in place first.
PaaS services can also be offered as a part of the service bundling
strategy and consumed on-demand or through automatic provision-
ing. The owner of this domain is Andy.
3. SaaS services are vertical and horizontal applications: Required ver-
tical applications are education, tax and revenues, and human serv-
ices. Required horizontal applications are finance and accounting,
project management, collaboration, CRM, security, business intelli-
gence (BI), and reporting. Serious games is a game changer for Sta-
up that will emphasize e-learning and business process simulations.
The target market at the onset for serious games is education and
transportation services. The emphasis on BI is to augment CRM
with information on customers who are ready to talk to sales, and to
establish nurture streams for customers in the early buying stages.
Intended consumers are small- and medium-sized enterprises.
SaaS services are a part of Phase 1 and 1b, respectively, due to ease of
integration considerations and because the team requires time to
figure out which applications make the most sense in terms of busi-
ness complexities and ROI to enable as cloud services. As depicted,
SaaS services can be offered as a part of the service bundling strategy
or standalone. The owner of this domain is Peter.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
227
4. BPaaS services are vertical business processes: Although currently
not in scope, the targeted BPaaS service for Sta-up is employee ben-
efits management—a vertical solution with horizontal (cross indus-
try and organizational) impacts. The intended consumers are
initially small- and medium-sized enterprises. The services are a
part of Phase 2, which can take up to two years to deliver. BPaaS
services are bundled with applications, a platform, and infrastruc-
ture, and the current intentions are to make BPaaS services available
by third-party providers that are accountable to Sta-up. The owner
of this domain is Peter.
Overarching are payment options, service levels, and enterprise serv-
ice management. These services are applicable to SME and large enter-
prises. The team suggests several payments options to attract customers;
these options are
■Pay as you go: Allows users to pay for services used whether they pur-
chased licenses or selected metered usage.
■Bring your own license (BYOL): Allows existing licenses to be carried
forward onto the cloud platform.
■Volume Discounts: Users buy in volumes to receive attractive discounts.
Service availability will be measured as Total Uptime Hours/Total Hours
within a month. To meet current service levels, Sta-up requires 99.95%
availability. The recovery point objective (RPO) is 20 minutes, meaning
when the cloud becomes available, all data must be restored to a point within
20 minutes before the disaster, while the recovery time objective (RTO) is .5
hours, meaning the cloud must be available for service within 30 minutes of
the outage’s occurrence. The team realizes these service levels are stringent
and will negotiate with cloud service providers as long as existing customer
service levels are not compromised.
Enterprise service management and integration addresses end-to-end
management of the cloud solution internal to the cloud and across the
Sta-up enterprise as appropriate. Service consultants provide assistance
in the areas of steady state operations including software and hardware
upgrades, vendor liaisons and integration with existing business support
services such as billing and order management; cloud specific manage-
ment and performance monitoring, including new features, service 

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
228
portfolio upgrades and user management; and integrated service desk
support in three international languages and English to support the
South American region. Enterprise integration includes front-end and
back-office collaboration and connectivity.
Project Gold is a reminder of some cloud adoption business essentials,
such as the need for a clear strategic vision with business objectives; the
importance of building relationships and teaming across business lines
to derive service portfolio requirements even if you decide to commence
implementation with a specific business unit; and implementation
activities such as the need for service desk support and cultural consider-
ations. The study illustrates the value of collective thinking to stir cre-
ativity and innovation when building out your strategic roadmap so that
your enterprise cloud adoption strategy is both effective today and sus-
tainable tomorrow. As you read on, you find elaborations of some cloud
business patterns, business adoption trends, and emerging technologies
for consideration as you develop and evolve your strategy.
Cloud Business Adoption Patterns and Trends
Chapter 3 provided decision analyses for some cloud business adop-
tion patterns. Each pattern is described next. Keep in mind that more
than one pattern can be applied to address business requirements, and
many are enabled as traditional and new IT solution providers begin to
work together to remain competitive.
Business Adoption Patterns
The business adoption patterns are as follows:
■Allocation: This pattern is applied to determine what service types to
include in your portfolio. Traditionally, many companies entered the
cloud space by adopting IaaS and for horizontal business purposes. The
trend is shifting to vertical solutions such as BPaaS to address the needs
of vertical markets.
■Broker: The broker pattern is the use of an intermediary to advise you or
to make cloud adoption decisions on your behalf.
■Bundling: The selection of packaged cloud solutions that are bundled by
providers or on demand for cloud service consumers.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
229
■Diversification: The deliberate selection of a diverse set of cloud service
types and deployment options in an effort to optimize enterprise returns.
Coexistence of both public clouds and private clouds in an organization is
an example of a hybrid cloud and a diversification strategy that I expect
to grow by large and small enterprises as was indicated in the Project
Gold case study.
■Federation: Establishes a trust relationship between cloud providers on-
and off-premise so that clouds can automatically access one another to
fulfill a business request with single sign-on capability. This pattern
allows enterprises to move workloads seamlessly across internal and exter-
nal clouds.
■Rebalancing: Regularly shift adoption patterns to match your changing
business model and evolving customer requirements. Revisiting and
updating your cloud adoption strategy drives rebalancing.
■Resell: This pattern is growing and as of late has become particularly
popular with Telco providers. A reseller buys cloud services from
providers with the option to add capability or resell those exact same
services for profit. Resellers are also referenced as value added resellers
(VARs) as discussed earlier in this chapter as a part of the Project Gold
case study.
■Self-service: This pattern is applied when selection of cloud services
occurs by the consumer, at purchase. The objective is to self empower
consumers to purchase cloud services at their convenience.
■Sourcing: This pattern is applied to source solutions. Some options are
cloud-sourcing through known outsourced providers, cloud-sourcing
through new service providers, cloud-sourcing in-house, or do not source
solutions from cloud but instead use alternate means such as traditional
outsourcing.
■Trade: This pattern is applied to address unused assets that result from
cloud adoption. Some options are to sell assets, repurpose within your
organization, or rent out the assets for a fee. Spot trade is an example
where the value of the sale of the asset occurs immediately as opposed to
future trades where value is realized later.
Financial Patterns
Chapter 8, “Financial Considerations,” was a reminder that as compa-
nies adapt to the ubiquitous data centers and compute resources that are

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
230
readily available anywhere, anytime, and from any location, they can
expect energy costs, IT expenses and up-front investment costs to
shrink. Note, however, that in cases of private cloud adoption, some up-
front investments are often required.
The Project Gold case study emphasized the expectations of cloud
consumers one of which is that candidate providers should be able and
willing to partake in a shared risk and shared reward financial strategy.
The challenge becomes how to go about developing the right financial
model so that it is a win-win for both companies. When it occurs, such
partnerships are drivers of successful cloud implementations because the
level of commitment on the part of the provider is just as genuine and
dedicated as the consumers’ level of commitment and dedication. Some
techniques include outcome-based contracts, as discussed in the case
study.
An example financial pattern for VARs or private cloud consumers is
to pay for up-front investments as they grow so that as they reach target
revenue levels consumers pay more on capital expenditure investments
until paid in full. Other examples might be for consumers and providers
to split investment costs and profits or to practice margin acceleration,
meaning the cost per unit of CSP cloud service offerings drops as vol-
umes increase, which increases profit margins and sales incentives. The
point is that providers are working with consumers to arrange the best
financial options as was the expectation of Project Gold. When it comes
to revenue generation, the case study reflected a markup of 20 percent of
cloud solutions that are resold and incurrence of direct financial benefits
due to working with existing outsourced providers.
Financial patterns will evolve to become even more attractive due to
more creative partnership models, more predictable markets, which was
a challenge for Project Gold due to market hopefulness yet growth
uncertainties, and financial models that are and will continue to emerge.
Questionable, however, is the value of multiyear IT implementations as
such strategies appear to be dissolving with the emergence of cloud and
other rapid delivery models. Traditional outsourcers for instance must
recognize the value of cloud-sourcing their operations to reduce the cost
and improve the quality of services. Complex issues concerning privacy,
local, and international jurisdictions are examples of the kinds of finan-
cial patterns that are evolving to support the cloud paradigm.
My expectation is that private and public cloud consumers as well as
VARs will reap financial rewards as the cost of doing business in the
cloud shrinks with inclining business value, and while I don’t think we

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
231
are there yet, tools will emerge that will allow you to better monitor
your spending on cloud so that you can clearly demonstrate how this
business technology is truly facilitating productivity and advancement
of your business. A performance dashboard is a good example of a tool
that exists today, while the opportunity is in the area of business intelli-
gence and metrics. And while shared risk/shared reward models offer
strategic advantages for both consumers and providers, two challenging
areas of consideration for both parties are managing intellectual property
and effectively handling the financials when contracts are dissolved.
Industry Verticals: How Are They Taking Advantage of
Cloud?
Industry verticals are taking a closer look at cloud with a focus on
leveraging the technology to solve business challenges. While cost is
still important, it appears that capabilities such as efficient information
processing, real-time business processing, 
outsourcing (BPO), and
automation are taking precedence. Both small and large enterprises
appear to have an interest in vertical cloud offerings.
Hospitals, for instance, are taking advantage of private clouds to sup-
port electronic health records moving away from paper-based solutions.
Applications such as shift management and recruiting tools for health-
care institutions can help reduce labor costs, and the accessibility
through cloud-enabled communities allows individuals or companies to
take advantage of the capability. This means medical staff, doctors
included, can take advantage of mobile devices to facilitate patient care.
This also means the skills of your teams (business and IT) must encom-
pass industry vertical knowledge, including privacy, security, and regu-
latory compliance requirements.
The energy and utilities industry is taking advantage of cloud to
address increased energy demands. Executives such as Steve Ballmer of
Microsoft recently shared how the use of cloud and other emerging tech-
nologies can better manage large influxes of data and speed insight to
finding affordable energy solutions. He suggests bringing business part-
nering and business technology advancements to energy and utilities
(E&U) companies to improve real-time communication and collabora-
tion, enable massive data aggregation, provide secure access to informa-
tion, and empower workers with business intelligence on smart devices.5
Telcos are taking a more active role by operating as cloud service
providers. The Project Gold case study is based on real-life Telco experiences

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
232
where companies recognize opportunities to accelerate market penetration
through the use of cloud. Many are introducing new products and services
that traditionally would not fall within a Telco’s core competency. Some
examples are SaaS and IaaS, while competencies such as managed hosting fall
within traditional business models. Many Telcos are reselling SaaS services to
augment infrastructure-focused cloud solutions.
Media and entertainment companies are taking advantage of public
cloud storage due to fluctuating business needs and requirements to
handle streaming media. As discussed in the case study, the benefits of
storage are particularly appealing to SMBs, and organizations must be
careful as to what data should be placed in the cloud and maintain a line
of sight into how to retrieve data should providers find themselves out of
a job.
Automotive industries are taking to cloud for what is called “cloud-
sourced navigation.”6 This trend enables navigation systems to rely on
information that is stored in the cloud as opposed to embedded data-
bases where the devices operate in a standalone capacity. Maps, traffic,
and weather conditions are examples of cloud-sourced content that is
enabled through consistent “online” connectivity. Other examples of
cloud-based navigation services are traffic camera visuals and map
updates.
A travel and transportation client in China was experiencing excessive
data overload due to the deployment of sensors and meters across the
city on cars, buses, mopeds, and some traffic lights. City officials strug-
gled with how to use this data to develop a “smarter city.” Officials were
overwhelmed as to how to even get started considering the wealth of
challenges. Cloud was suggested as the business technology that would
enable business process modeling and simulations to guide development
of a strategic roadmap and the implications of proposed actions.
Organizations are increasingly choosing cloud service providers to
transform key business processes in departments such as marketing,
finance, and customer service, and the demand for cloud is on the rise.
Several industry-specific solutions are described in the case studies in
Appendix B; in particular, universities and schools face increasing cost
challenges while, in parallel, they are required to roll out online tools for
education and e-learning services. This requires scalable infrastructures,
along with virtual labs and remote data center access, data mining is
often required, and high performance computing or the use of server-
based super computers. Cloud enables students, faculty, and alumni to

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
233
access academia and process solutions effectively and keeps schools up
with the emerging technologies that they are in fact teaching. The situ-
ation is elaborated in Appendix B.
Solution Patterns
Your candidate cloud provider should have and be willing to commu-
nicate its cloud reference architecture, and you should work with your
enterprise architect to ensure that the cloud solution fits and adheres to
your enterprise architecture and cloud principles. Figure E.4 provides an
example cloud computing reference architecture (CCRA) provided by
IBM. The main roles and corresponding architectural elements are
defined at the highest level, allowing decomposition or drill-down for
each element as needed.

In this example, the CCRA defines three main roles: cloud service
consumer, cloud service provider, and cloud service creator. Each role

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
234
can be fulfilled by a single person or by a group of people or an organiza-
tion. The roles defined here intend to capture the common set of roles
typically encountered in any cloud computing environment. Therefore,
it is important to note that depending on a particular cloud computing
scenario or specific cloud implementation, project-specific subroles may
be defined. Detailed cloud roles and responsibilities are discussed in
Appendix A, “Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud.”
Evident in the Project Gold case study, it is important to integrate
cloud services within your existing enterprise (small and large). You and
your provider should discuss integration requirements and the required
tools. On a recent engagement, a customer’s enterprise billing system
used unique, specialized technologies and required sessions between the
consumer and provider to develop the appropriate integration strategy.
On another engagement, a client wanted to deploy some applications
into the cloud to support his private cloud strategy, only that became
impossible due to the dated application libraries. When you are looking
at enterprise integration there is more to it than application integration.
There is data, infrastructure, and business processes. Your provider has
to look at integration from all layers of the cloud stack.
The Cloud Computing Management Platform (CCMP) is responsible
for delivering instances of cloud services of any category to cloud service
consumers. As discussed in earlier chapters, cloud services can be built
on top of each other; for example, a software service could consume a
platform or infrastructure service, and a platform service could consume
an infrastructure service. Bringing any cloud service to market requires
corresponding pre-investment, along with respective metering and
charging models in support of the corresponding business model.
In this example, the CCMP is split into two main elements:
■Operational support services (OSSs): OSSs represent the set of opera-
tional and technical services exposed by the CCMP. These services are
required by to implement a cloud service. Example OSSs are the service
delivery catalog, service automation, and provisioning. Many OSS com-
ponents can also be encountered in traditionally managed data centers
such as monitoring and event management, while other components such
as image management are specific to cloud.
■Business support services (BSSs): BSSs represent the set of business-
related services exposed by the CCMP. These services are consumed and
directly impact the user’s experience. Example BSSs are the service offer-
ing catalog, billing, and pricing.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
235
Security, resiliency, performance, and consumability span the cloud
environment. These nonfunctional aspects must be addressed holistically
from the view of the consumer through cloud solution delivery. These
components address the way your cloud is set up including the hardware
infrastructure. Your provider looks at network zoning setup, data center
setup, disaster recovery, and a host of other capabilities so that the solu-
tion will perform.
Service creation tools are used by the cloud service creator to develop
new or modify existing cloud services. Example tools are metering and
provisioning.
In Chapter 5, “What About Governance?,” you learned about the
need and value of governing your enterprise that has integrated cloud as
a part of the solution landscape. The chapter emphasized the need for
end-to-end business and IT governance. In this example, governance of
the development and deployment of cloud solutions is the focus. It is an
essential element of the CCRA. You should ask your providers what
their cloud governance processes are; for instance, who is accountable for
and how will they ensure that single-tenancy environments are built and
operating to service commitments? You then want to ensure that their
cloud governance adheres to your strategic, enterprise governance model
and/or framework.
Emerging Technologies
While business trends and adoption patterns are significant, one area
that cannot be ignored is emerging technologies. Take a look two to
three years down the road to see what’s coming, how you will be able to
solve your business challenges, as well as how you will be able to apply
your current methods, technologies, and your cloud adoption strategy to
incorporate these emerging trends. One of the opening topics in this
chapter is a discussion on the CIO’s visionary plans where projected use
of technologies was elaborated. This section focuses on emerging or
upcoming technologies for the year 2012 and beyond. Understanding
where technology is headed and how such capabilities can augment your
skills and capabilities in support of your cloud adoption strategy can be
invaluable. Our planet is becoming smarter and more intelligent.
Intelligence is being infused into the way the world literally works—the
systems and processes that enable physical goods to be developed, manu-
factured, bought, and sold; services to be delivered; everything from

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
236
people and money to oil, water, and electrons to move, and billions of
people to work and live. Our intelligent, smarter world evolves by con-
necting the digital representation (a.k.a models) of three interdependent
domains. First, the human world of individuals and communities that
includes social networks. Second, our physical reality of geospatial mod-
els, physics, sensors, or robotics. Third, the business and IT world of
business processes, applications, and data models.
The evolution of the smarter planet will accelerate to capture and
model different worlds at different abstractions creating impactful busi-
ness outcomes for those organizations that leverage and create value
from these three merging models of our world. Of course, cloud delivery
will be a significant factor in the capability of these models to merge
and create value. Cloud computing may become the dominant means for
delivery of computing infrastructure and applications on the Internet.
As the cloud delivery mechanism takes hold, the control components of
software—that is, components that are used to create, configure, and
adjust the nature of applications—are going to be moving to the edge of
the enterprise but remain outside the cloud. A significant impact of
cloud computing is the rapidity and ease of creating new computing
functions and services in the network.
Combining existing applications and data with new types of process-
ing functions and technologies derives new value: Big Data, social busi-
ness, mobile computing, and analytics. This combination process creates
a network of applications and data services, jointly referred to as com-
puting services. In this network of computing services, businesses tend
to keep those computing services that are critical to their business
within their premises and in a manner of speaking, outsource the non-
critical computing services to the cloud.
As the industry moves to the new model of outsourcing in the com-
puting services arena, we may see the control components of the com-
puting services networks getting aggregated and moving toward the
edge of the enterprise. The control components of the computing serv-
ices networks are functions used to create, control access, and modify the
computing services network. These control components are going to
move toward the edge of the enterprise, where they are used to control
the interactions between the computing services within the enterprise
and within the cloud.
Dynamic and autonomous systems, conversational language solutions,
self-optimizing software, and advanced robotics with self-navigating

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
237
speech capable robots may cause the emergence of new industries as a
result of cross-industry systems. As a result a combination of factors,
including improved modeling, analytics, rules engines, discovery mech-
anisms, and monitoring tools, is making it possible to return control of
a business’s operations to its executives.
It was recently reported that the United States military has a new
weapon that could save many American lives. It is the driverless truck or
as reported, “drone convoys.” This technology (which has some cloud
characteristics) moves truck convoys without using drivers. The technol-
ogy has been in development by Lockheed Martin over the last six years,
and according to reports these vehicles become robots that can travel in
convoy style with as long as 25 trucks in a row at some 65 miles per
hour and remain on course.
“In semi-autonomous mode, if there is a soldier in the vehicle, that
soldier can be looking for threats, including IEDs, rather than operating
the vehicle,” Lockheed Martin program manager Adrian Michalicek
said. “And they can avoid obstacles such as a child who might dart into
their path.”8 This is an exciting technology that has emerged to keep our
soldiers safe. Driverless vehicles are not just offered by the military,
however; it was recently reported that Google is experimenting with a
self-driving car.9 The cars are loaded with sensors that feed data to an in-
vehicle computer for control and the intentions are to develop safer and
more efficient cars.
Imagine your ability (regardless of your physical state of being) to
automatically detect and immediately reject your doctor’s intention for
medical treatment that might be harmful to you. Imagine walking down
the street and your mobile device informs and guides you to the appro-
priate nearby restaurant that serves the proper meals for your immediate
situation, because it knows you are a diabetic and your current insulin
levels. Imagine an IBM Watson™capability in an emergency room where
all the medical information in the world resides at your finger tips—on
a computer system that is accessible by you and your doctors to quickly
diagnose your situation enabling medical professionals to keep pace with
the constant pace of new drugs and findings when it comes to medical
cures and side-effects. Reportedly, IBM is working with medical experts
to identify the best ways to incorporate Watson-like technology to the
practice of medicine.10
The examples in this section offer insights into where we are headed
with respect to business technology adoption and adaptation. As was

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
238
depicted the motivation may not always be for profit as in the case of the
“drone convoys and medical necessities” where the emphasis is on saving
lives but as evidenced, the impacts are substantial. Can you see how tak-
ing advantage of cloud can increase business value and expand the possi-
bilities for your business?
Summary
Business technologies are a part of our daily lives. We are constantly
connected, and we do not have to carry around excessive devices any
longer to do so. Companies that leverage business technologies such as
cloud to more effectively solve problems and those that are willing to
step out of their comfort zones and explore new innovations with these
technologies are the ones that will remain competitive. I agree with the
comments made in the book World Class IT: Why Businesses Succeed When
IT Triumphs,11 where the author reminds us that IT is a source of innova-
tion and that CIOs that understand that they are stewards can help
spread innovation more broadly.
Today, we’re seeing the impact of cloud in companies; some starting
in the home and flowing into the business environment through the use
of smart and mobile devices.. Focus on an integrated business and IT
strategy that will leverage your company’s strategic advantage, knowing
that business teams are not as successful as they can be without an IT
strategy and IT teams are not as successful as they can be without a busi-
ness strategy. Adding cloud to your integrated strategy makes your
adoption that much more valuable, much more effective, and longer
lasting. For those that have gotten started with cloud, it is time to start
thinking about broadening your horizons so that you strengthen your
investments. Maintain your vision yet broaden your scope.
Summarizing this book, the initial chapters described the business
value of a cloud adoption strategy and the value of focusing on the enter-
prise and embracing EA principles to maximize your investment poten-
tial and business performance. You then learned techniques to identify
cloud candidates in a manner that helps to drive business value.
Mitigating the business and technical risks are core techniques toward
development of a successful transition plan that must be also governed,
financially managed, and secured. Considerations for risk management,
governance, security, and financial implications are therefore reflected in
many of the chapters.

Epilogue: Thinking Beyond the Race
239
In this epilogue, it is requested of you to maintain your strategic eye
(your vision to develop an effective, enterprise cloud adoption strategy)
even when faced with tactical actions and decisions. You are reminded
that the days of large companies driving technology are pretty much
over and that cloud providers must consider the consumer to be success-
ful in their endeavors. But, how can they if you yourself do not have a
strategy? Along the same topic, consider your own organization where
consumers buy smart phones, tablets, and other devices and bring them
into the workplace. Your business and IT teams should view this as an
opportunity to wisely accommodate, which will in turn strengthen your
organizational capabilities, prevent unapproved use of tools and addi-
tions to your network, mitigate business risks, and add to your team’s
overall effectiveness. In essence, the question is not about whether adop-
tion will occur but how? It is not a question of whether business value
will be achieved but how quickly and how much?
This epilogue concluded with a discussion on some emerging tech-
nologies and further the conversation in Appendix C, “More on Cloud
Business Trends,” as a reminder that such knowledge sharing, awareness,
and adaptation is important, just as the other content discussed in this
book, toward enabling you to choose the best cloud adoption strategy for
your business. The race is approaching. Are you prepared, are you ready
for the next one, what is your strategy?
In closing, it is important to build a culture of trust, collaboration,
and innovation when it comes to cloud adoption. Such considerations
were shared throughout this epilogue along with the need for organiza-
tional support and business performance sustainability as summarized in
Table E.3.

The most relevant lesson is the need to continually move to the future. This
requires investment... when your model is based on innovation, on continual 
forward movement... you make these investments.
It also requires risk-taking. Running an innovation model over the long term
is not for the faint-hearted. It often compels the enterprise to act when it is not
obvious to do so... to place bets that seem risky to those who are focused on short-
term gain... and to combat corporate inertia when times are good.
And it means you have to know when to leave behind the sources of your previ-
ous success...sustaining an innovation model over the long term—for a decade,
much less a century—also means leaving the past... your own past... behind.
Companies, as well as nations, need to know when to make this transition.

appendix provides business considerations for augmenting your delivery
model, such as the use of data centers and delivery methods with cloud
as well as strategies that you should consider to maintain or even
improve your brand.
Delivery Models and Cloud Considerations
Your delivery model should have direct correlation with your inte-
grated business and IT strategy and thus your organizational effective-
ness. Delivery model (in this context) is the use of people, processes,
information, and technology to deliver IT solutions to your customers,
employees, partners and suppliers.
The typical IT delivery model keeps most risk residing within the IT
organization. The IT organization is responsible for the data center, the
hardware in the data center, and the application stack. Financially, the
IT costs are fixed, as the data center was on premise, owned, and depre-
ciated over extended periods of time (for example, 20 years) while equip-
ment typically depreciated over five to seven years.
Public cloud computing provides the opposite end of the scale, with
the risk of the data center and hardware moved to the cloud service
provider, and a variable financial model as cloud services are provided
using a subscription or usage-based model.
Consider Figure A.1, which shows a two-dimensional set of options
for IT delivery models based on four premise delivery options (on prem-
ises, on premises utility, off premises dedicated, and off premises
shared), and three financial models (fixed, mixed, and variable).
The adoption and use of cloud enables cloud consumers to augment
their delivery model to preserve capital, take advantage of new market
opportunities, improve IT effectiveness, or to make IT a center of inno-
vation. For example, some service providers (IBM and others) offer com-
ponents that allow you to build your own private cloud environment in
addition to services that help you create your own public cloud. Both
result in an on-premises utility delivery model that you control, an envi-
ronment that you can grow and expand depending on your business
needs. Utility in this context implies the creation of a multipurpose IT
infrastructure that provides common functions that can be shared by
multiple customers with pay per use options. Utility services include
business processes, software, and infrastructure.

Delivery models and cloud considerations
A typical fixed (flat rates are charged for service purchases regardless
of the amount of consumption) financial model integrating cloud fur-
thers an organization’s capability to move to a more consumption based
financial model where consumers are accurately charged only for their
service usage. In this example, financial modeling occurs on the current
and upcoming years. Consider the following real-life business scenarios.
Brand, Incorporated, hires TCP Enterprises (a cloud service provider)
to build a private cloud with compute and storage service offerings,
where a private cloud indicates that the cloud resides in Brand’s data
center. In addition, the private cloud would be managed and governed
by Brand while operations of the cloud environment, including perform-
ance and maintenance, is the responsibility of TCP (refer to managed
operations in Figure A.1).
Brand plans to offer cloud services to existing and new customers
making it an on-premise utility service available as a public cloud offer-
ing. Charges for building the cloud and managing the operations are
fixed and extend over a ten-year period, while charges to Brand’s end
users are consumption based. At the same time, TCP receives a percent-
age of the profits generated via the purchase of cloud services by Brand’s

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
246
end users making the financial model for Brand mixed, comprised of
both fixed (for managed operations) and variable costs (to accommodate
both private and public cloud services).
NOTE
This scenario is a growing reality and example of how businesses are
partnering to augment their delivery models with cloud. Two strategic
relationships surface from this scenario. First, Brand is a consumer of a
private cloud offering from TCP where TCP’s delivery model is on
premises and private cloud delivery. Second, Brand leverages that same
private cloud to become a public cloud service provider where Brand’s
delivery model is on-premises utility and public cloud delivery.
Service providers offer public and private cloud offerings. These are
represented in Figure A.1 as off premises dedicated or off premises
shared delivery models with a variable as opposed to fixed financial
model. In this case, it is a standard practice to charge consumers for
actual usage of services. This is usually accomplished with subscription
or metered enablement. Consider the following example.
Brand, Incorporated, hired TCP Enterprises to build a cloud that
would be hosted from TCP’s data center. In this example, TCP is responsi-
ble for managing and governing the cloud environment in accordance
with Brand’s service level requirements. Authorized subscribers to this
cloud as specified by Brand are employees and authorized personnel.
Brand expressed that the cloud environment must not be shared with
other TCP customers. In other words, it is dedicated to Brand. This is an
example of an off-premises dedicated delivery model. If and when Brand
authorizes TCP to allow TCP customers and other business partners to use
the cloud environment, it will become an off-premises environment.
Referencing Figure A.1, financial models traditionally were fixed but are
moving to variable models to support off-premises delivery models.
The use of cloud within your organization will change over time just
as business and IT requirements change and as cloud offerings change.
Customers periodically go through periods where their data center and
or IT equipment is fully utilized and future growth is constrained or not
yet available. Cloud provides a temporary location for IT workloads
while additional data center resources become available.

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
247
Many of the initial public cloud computing offerings were
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, where the service provider
owned the data center, IT hardware, and base operating systems. The
customer was responsible for installing the rest of the software stack
including the application and for operating the cloud workload.
Then Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
surfaced. These offerings include more of the software stack, up to and
including customer applications and the system management tooling to
run IT workloads without involving IT resources. In fact, previous out-
sourcing and out-tasking workloads have given way to SaaS cloud envi-
ronments based on a variable financial model.
In a typical data center, some servers might run billing applications,
while others run enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications. You
might consider adoption of an on-premise private cloud where applica-
tions run on whichever servers have free cycles at the time the applica-
tions need to run. This separation of applications from the hardware that
it runs on is one of several advantages of cloud. Traditional data centers
are also larger than what they need to be. Cloud grants you the opportu-
nity to shrink your data center costs and physical capacity and expand in
the future as needed supporting more of a Just-In-Time1 (JIT) strategy.
NOTE
JIT is a business inventory and production strategy that strives to improve
a company’s return on investment by reducing in-process inventory and
any associated overhead. JIT companies focus on increasing efficiency and
decreasing waste by receiving goods only as they are needed in the
production process, thereby reducing inventory and warehousing costs.
Data centers are moving to a JIT model to optimize costs and asset reuse.
Maximizing your investment benefits requires an understanding of how
future business and IT requirements are changing. You must understand
what cloud options will exist over time, such that you should consider incor-
porating cloud delivery models into your overarching and integrated busi-
ness and IT strategy (your EA). While you might not move 100 percent of
your workloads to cloud in the immediate future and thus eliminate the need
for internal data centers, you now have the capability to streamline data 
center assets, and you have the opportunity for a certain percentage of risks

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
248
associated with current IT delivery processes and requirements to be miti-
gated by taking advantage of cloud delivery models thus improving service
levels and overarching performance.
Building Efficiencies and Sustainability
Organizations are working to optimize energy and efficiencies in
office buildings, data centers, campuses, and other facilities. Cloud solu-
tions provide analytics, automation, command and control, and asset
management services helping you achieve your desired energy efficiency
objectives by providing information allowing you to optimize building
use and marginalize occupancy costs and space requirements.
In addition, if you purchase cloud services, any required servers and
software assets are not required to reside in your data center, which in
turn improves your capacity for energy efficiency and environmental sus-
tainability. Your ability to use external assets to handle your temporary
requirements such as business peak loads and the fact that you are shar-
ing capacity across larger pools of users certainly adds to your capacity to
optimize utilization of equipment and environmental sustainability.
Your on-premises data centers should be designed to utilize renewable
energy sources, and you should monitor energy efficiencies such as the
power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio that measures how efficiently
power is actually used by computing equipment (in comparison with
cooling and other overhead) and Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency
(DCiE),2 which is a more accurate reflection of power usage that takes
into account raised floor power. Provisioning and virtualization manage-
ment software can reduce server power consumption substantially along
with management functions such as power capping.
You should discuss your efficiency goals and requirements with serv-
ice providers since your off-premises green objectives should be as
important to you as your on-premises objectives. In fact, providers that
offer eco-friendly cloud solutions could differentiate themselves from
their competition. There might be incentives for cloud providers, partic-
ularly if servers are purchased in larger quantities. For instance,
providers may be able to negotiate with vendors to build lower powered
servers, CPUs, and storage, or they may consider customized orders to
include better cooling to prevent excess generation of heat and equip-
ment failures.

A final note on this subject is equipment disposal. Discarded comput-
ers don’t just take up space in a landfill; they spread toxins into the
environment. You need a responsible way to recycle your equipment that
is good for business and the environment. You will want to work with
companies that recycle end-of-life IT assets, such as servers, hard drives,
monitors, and so on, and you will need to choose vendors that will han-
dle your recycling and disposal needs in an environmentally friendly,
EPA approved manner, complying with all regulatory requirements and
local legalities.
Project and Solution Delivery Model (PSDM)
Organizations (business and IT) need to adapt to the accelerated proj-
ect and solution delivery life cycle (PSDM) to support the cloud delivery
model. Traditionally a project lasts months and requires a large delivery
team with various skills to complete the effort. Teams include project
managers, data analysts, application developers, testers, subject matter
experts, and more. With the adoption of cloud, projects are implemented
in shorter timeframes and require fewer resources, increasing end user
demands with expectations of faster, improved services at reduced costs.
With this background, and regardless of whether you are a consumer
or provider of cloud services, your PSDM needs to support rapid devel-
opment and embed fast-track, agile approaches to solution delivery as
users will likely find traditional phases to be too long and too cumber-
some. At the same time, there are key elements of development life
cycles (for both software and products), such as viability assessments,
requirements baselining, design, testing, performance engineering, and
quality assurance efforts, including user acceptance testing, that should
not be short circuited. Solution rework, failure to satisfy requirements,
and dissatisfied customers are experienced outcomes should this occur.
In the case of outsourcing, it generally takes longer to provision envi-
ronments as long as traditional development life cycles and approaches
are utilized. Understandably, more outsource providers are becoming
cloud providers. Use caution when selecting outsourcers and find out
what rapid software and product development life cycles are used
including automated provisioning of development, test, and acceptance
test environments. These precautionary steps prevent you from offload-
ing services to outsourcers to save on costs only to discover that it would
have been more beneficial had you offloaded services to cloud.

250
Business leaders are attracted to self-service capabilities such as build-
ing a Web site, dashboard, or application without having to contact the
IT department or following stringent protocols. This means that an 
ability to acquire cloud services to solve business challenges in a self-
sufficient capacity is beneficial to organizations. This capability, how-
ever, adds a level of complexity to your service management processes as
more environments, even if virtual, must be adequately governed, man-
aged, and maintained. A recommended strategy is to require product
and IT teams to align with and operate as trusted advisors to business
leaders, and establish a governance framework that does not hinder but
rather guides cloud adoption and ensures enterprise alignment. Consider
the following scenario:
Brand discovered that software licensing and warranties for some
legacy applications were no longer renewable since support for the soft-
ware was nearing end of life by the vendors. The CFO excitedly tells the
business that TCP will move forward with cloud solutions to replace the
legacy applications. However, the VP of marketing and sales does not
agree because one of the legacy applications has been customized to pro-
vide key functionality that is required for customer demographical
analysis. The dilemma for TCP is to let the legacy system’s warranty
expire and do nothing considering that performance issues have not been
a problem, or replace the legacy system in its entirety because it would
be impossible to simply replace only one of the applications.
This is a common dilemma that organizations are experiencing and a
prime example and opportunity for the CIO, CTO, and IT delivery
teams to collaborate and influence direction relative to cloud adoption.
TCP should establish governing policies and procedures so that teams
know when to engage the necessary resources, when stakeholder involve-
ment is optional, and when it is required.
NOTE
Although a lower level of analysis is required, and typically by cloud
providers, a key consideration is determining which (if any) components
of legacy applications can be provided in a cloud environment. This is
significant in cases where the application itself may be categorized as
unfit for cloud. In such cases, you would explore opportunities to make
components of the application available in the cloud such as the user
interface or data tier.

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
251
Global Delivery Model (GDM)
It is not surprising to find that many offshore vendors are becoming
cloud providers to support the low-cost delivery model that cloud brings
to bear. Consumers of cloud services are demanding bilingual capabili-
ties (for example, French translations and currency conversions of the
service catalog) and a broader reach when it comes to global consump-
tion of cloud services. There is also expressed concern by some con-
sumers on the exposure of data in public clouds, which opens the door to
growth in private clouds3 that sit behind an enterprise’s firewall but has
global capacity. Considering the proliferation of cloud services that are
occurring, globalization could be a differentiator for cloud providers.
You can take advantage of cloud to expand your global delivery model
(GDM). A GDM is IT-enabled services that are coordinated and deliv-
ered by global project teams. In a GDM, offshore teams execute based on
the inputs gathered from the onsite team. A good example of this is sys-
tems testing where requirements gathering sessions occur locally and
data are disseminated to global teams for quality assurance testing. In
such cases, regular reporting and collaborations ensure that at all times
offshore actions align with business and local team requirements. Cloud
enables you to connect, collaborate, and establish business in interna-
tional markets faster due to rapid access and provisioning of required
services anywhere and at anytime. You might have hired offshore teams
to conduct application development or testing, or to conduct activities
such as set up and configure infrastructure that is then deployed to your
resources as a part of your refresh processes. With cloud, offshore capa-
bilities can be augmented or replaced in their entirety with virtual serv-
ices. Consider the following scenario:
Your GDM enables you to expand or move to different regions on
demand without having to plan and implement lengthy systems
updates. Your global data centers could potentially eliminate regulatory
issues that surface when transferring data across geographical boundaries
with in-policy rapid and automated provisioning services. This is
directly dependent on how your cloud solution is configured. For
instance, a cloud consumer may not want his/her client data stored in
another country due to regulatory requirements. The provider could, in
this case, set up a global cloud that is hosted out of the consumer’s data
center or a dedicated location within the consumer’s geographical
boundaries.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
252
Cloud and GDM give you the ability to build and run global initia-
tives faster and more efficiently. An example is leveraging global cloud
collaboration tools to build virtual teams and manage communications
across projects. GDM also makes it easier for you to transfer work to
alternate, safer locations for disaster recovery, failover, and for client risk
mitigation, which amounts to faster time to value and business agility,
and a common example is the use of cloud to advance supply chain com-
munications so that delivery of goods and services are identified and exe-
cuted faster, often ahead of the need, and more efficiently. These
opportunities present substantial business savings. You and your
provider must be careful, however, to comply with international laws
including domestic export laws and import laws of destination nations.
Shared Service Delivery Model (SSDM)
Shared service is an example IT delivery model. It is an organization
that provides support services that are “shared” across multiple business
units. If you are operating as a shared service organization, your IT
teams have the capacity to make and stand behind service level commit-
ments, and the capacity to offer and deliver the right services and prod-
ucts at the right time, with high quality. This is because a shared service
delivery team is aware of customer needs, they have a focus on driving
business value, they know their business performance targets, they know
their capacity to deliver, and they know when it makes more sense to
pursue alternative delivery mechanisms and sources.
Before adopting cloud, you should know and understand your service
capacity, understand your core competencies as discussed throughout
this book, and know your market (internal and external) so that you
source with cloud and other solutions appropriately.
If you compare SSDM to traditional delivery models, the shared serv-
ice model is customer focused with an eye not only for today’s business
requirements but also future demands, while the traditional IT service
delivery model operates more like a cost center with a focus on getting
things done.4 The value of traditional practices of buying, configuring,
and operating IT assets, followed with retirement has become question-
able as to efficiency and effectiveness, and alternative delivery models
such as cloud are becoming more popular. SSDM is a shared services
approach to supporting users where IT resources are offered as a shared
service. Cloud does not change your shared service delivery model,

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
253
instead it augments capabilities so that you provide greater services and
support to your customers. You can think of cloud in itself as a shared
service as well as an enabler for shared services such as SaaS.
Business Processes-as-a-Service (BPaaS) is an example cloud delivery
model whose economies of scale make it a more attractive approach than tra-
ditional delivery models such as business process outsourcing (BPO). This is
because BPaaS is a vertical solution that moves the typical cloud conversation
from cost reduction to fixing manual or inefficient business processes. In a
BPaaS model, business processes are provided externally and customers con-
nect over the Internet to the cloud and consume these services.
It is expected that by 2013, “nontraditional” service providers with
specific vertical and business intellectual property will aggressively enter
the BPaaS market, partnering and challenging traditional outsourcers,
and by 2015, 50 percent of new BPO deals will be delivered as BPaaS.5
BPaaS may also be referenced as business process utilities (BPUs).
In previous chapters, you learned that it is important to commence at
an enterprise level and decompose business requirements into specific
components. In Chapter 4, “Identifying Cloud Candidates,” you learned
how to do this. One example was through the use of your business archi-
tecture (BA) so that you ensure that processes, tools, systems, and busi-
ness demands align. This means that your IT organization knows and
understands its service portfolio and operates accordingly. You learned
the importance of business value outcomes and the importance of select-
ing cloud solutions in such as way that value is sustained across organi-
zations. In this model, IT organizations are fused into business units.
This value optimizing delivery model might result in the dissolution of
traditional IT organizations.6
Quite naturally, if you are a practicing shared service organization,
then integrating cloud might not present new challenges. This is
because you might have already established and applied governance with
adequate stewardship for purchasing IT solutions, you should have
developed enterprise standards and architecture, assessment criteria of
the internal IT organization’s service capabilities against external service
providers should be available, and funding and chargeback models for IT
services should be in effect. A notable benefit is that you might experi-
ence a decline in data center capacity requirements and better utilization
of your resources, which will lead to cost savings in overhead and power
consumption. If you are new to cloud or shared services, you should plan
your transition carefully and take the necessary steps to prevent unstruc-
tured adoption of cloud solutions.

254
Information Technology-as-a-Service (ITaaS)
Cloud is popular because of the variable financial model as discussed
previously. Up-front costs are marginalized, and there is an ease of doing
business in a cloud delivery model where business units can purchase
services without traditional IT rigor and approvals. As such, IT organi-
zations should focus more on offering IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS). This
means becoming more flexible and adaptable to changing business mod-
els and offering insights to solve business problems that might include
cloud purchases.
Traditionally, IT organizations were the sole or major source of solu-
tions, but now business units can easily buy solutions elsewhere. Thus
the opportunity presents itself for IT teams (whose capabilities may
evolve but will not go away) to help business leaders decide whether
cloud purchases are the right business decisions. Knowing that in-house
delivery will come under further scrutiny, internal capabilities in value
add competencies such as service integration, business process design,
business performance management, information management, risk man-
agement, cloud quality assurance, and test services, and end-to-end solu-
tion design and delivery will remain.
IT teams should be careful to maintain an objective eye on what
sourcing strategies are most suitable to address business needs for the
short and long term, and they must be careful to not project an image
that only IT teams can do it right or they will quickly lose the trust of
business leaders. Business leaders, on the other hand must maintain an
inventory of all IT purchases—expressly those that are not controlled by
IT departments—and engage IT leadership and insights when faced
with cloud adoption choices to sustain both decisions that are made and
positive relationships.
Bring your own (BYO) technology is enabled with cloud and supports
the ITaaS vision. With BYO employees are empowered to use their per-
sonal equipment such as iPads in the office where the goal is that
employees become more efficient, more innovative, and more produc-
tive. IT teams should invite BYO as a business enabler in the workplace
along with providing management and security controls.
IT organizations need to develop skills, capabilities and governance to
better market ITaaS services and ensure adequate awareness and training
on how to use such services. Operating as a cloud service provider, IT

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
255
organizations should manage the lifecycle of ITaaS service offerings
which includes pricing and chargeback precision.
An abundance of applications as well as information is readily avail-
able in the cloud. This data is typically delivered through SaaS and PaaS.
Does this mean that consumers’ traditional business, application, or
information architecture will go away? Of course not, but this does
imply that your teams should look to augment your application land-
scape with cloud and use that model to guide adoption decisions.

Key Cloud Roles and Responsibilities
Figure A.3 offers a list of three key roles and responsibilities that
should be considered as a part of your cloud adoption strategy. The roles
depicted are service creator, service consumer, and service provider. Each
role contains subroles. They are cloud focused and augment traditional
service delivery teams and end users. The following relationships are
depicted in the diagram:
■A service consumer may act as a service provider. This is common in
cases where service consumers buy and resell cloud solutions and services.
■A service provider may act as a service consumer; this is common in cases
where service providers use cloud services that are provided by others
such as SaaS services to augment an existing service portfolio.
■The relationship where service providers and service consumers can
include a service creator to build and/or integrate cloud solutions.

NOTE
Although the role of the enterprise architect is not illustrated, and as you
read in Chapter 2, executives generally view enterprise architects as front-
line contacts and a conduit for translating business needs into IT needs.
They trust the advice of enterprise architects to guide them with thought
leadership on cloud and the application of other business technologies and
if resources are ill-equipped or unavailable decision makers might turn to
less reliable sources for guidance. Understandably, companies should and
are relying on EA resources for cloud purposes.
The following is a list of all the roles depicted in Figure A.3 and
descriptions:
■Service creator: The service creator develops the cloud services that will
be consumed by the end user. The type of service created varies and
depends on the service offering itself. Some example creations are virtual
images, storage images, and multitenant applications. Here are the sub-
roles for service creator:
■
Service developer: The service developer designs, implements,
and maintains the technical aspects of a service template.
■
Service integrator (or broker): The service integrator designs,
develops, and implements the interface between the customer’s
on-premise environment and off-premise cloud entities.
■Service consumer: The service consumer uses cloud services. Service
consumers can also be buyers of cloud services for an organization. The
consumed services vary with the service offering; for example, when it
comes to SaaS offerings consumption is of an application while in IaaS or
PaaS situations; consumption is of hosted virtual images. A service con-
sumer may or may not be the end user (see consumer end user). Here are
the subroles for service consumer:
■
Consumer business manager: The consumer business manager
holds financial responsibility, accountability, and approval rights
for purchasing services.
■
Consumer administrator: The consumer administrator over-
looks all cloud operational processes and acts as focal point for
communications between provider and consumer.
■
Consumer end user: The consumer end user requests and uses
cloud resources.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
260
■Service provider: The service provider hosts cloud services for end users.
The type of hosted service depends on the type of offering. Service
providers can host services developed by other service developers (in addi-
tion to their own services). Here are the subroles for service provider:
■
Service deployment architect: The service deployment archi-
tect evaluates and configures service settings for successful cloud
deployments and ensures that compliance requirements are met.
■
Service business manager: The service business manager offers
all types of services and manages customer accounts.
■
Service transition manager: The service transition manager is
responsible for enabling a consumer to use the cloud service;
responsibilities include on-boarding, integration, and business
process adoption.
■
Service manager: The service manager focuses entirely on the
service that runs on the infrastructure, ensuring that all IT serv-
ices and infrastructure meets operational targets and that all con-
figuration items are appropriately recorded.
■
Service security manager: The service security manager ensures
that service providers appropriately manage all risks associated
with development, delivery, integrations, support, and use of the
cloud services.
■
Service operations manager: The service operations manager
manages the infrastructure required for providing cloud services.
■
Service premium support: The service premium support
provider is responsible for customer support and resolves levels 1,
2, and 3 problems according to service level agreements.
Collaborate, Experiment, and Act!
Along with augmenting your delivery model with cloud comes a
change in technique and attitude. For instance, the move toward more
effective collaboration to gain and apply the collective intelligence of
enterprise stakeholders and business partners; the willingness to experi-
ment and take risks; and your willingness to expediently make decisions
and act based on your collaboration and experimentation are three
important elements of your cloud adoption strategy and implementation
success as illustrated in Figure A.4. Each topic is expounded next.

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
261
Collaborate
Executive level stakeholders as well as service line leaders and practi-
tioners need to focus on managing essential IT activities so that high
value IT services are rendered, and so that information makes it to deci-
sion-makers faster and more accurately. This presents opportunities to
collaborate more effectively and more importantly compels you to adopt
new tools such as cloud that facilitate real-time information exchange
and business collaborations. Steps such as establishing company commu-
nities and enabling mobile collaborations (discussed in Appendix C,
“More On Cloud Business Trends”) are excellent ways to strengthen
delivery models. Consider the following scenario that demonstrates how
cloud was adopted to promote business collaborations for a company.
A company invited employees to participate in an online community
jam. The goal was to allow the best ideas to come forward pertaining to
new products and services that the company should offer. The format is
free-form where themes are posted and jammers respond to a topic or
create a new one to support a theme. Jammers were employees from all
geographies, all ages, and all ranks. The themes that attracted the most
interest were carried forward for vote and on to enterprise projects. This
initiative was successful, and as a result a second jam occurred with dif-
ferent themes but related topics, where external customers and business
partners were invited as participants. It too was successful, driving
change into the organization due to an integrated strategy of ideation
and requirements management.
In this example, not only did the collaboration tools promote team-
work and rapid ideation, but an added benefit was the credibility that

the company built with both internal and external communities simply
by seeking the opinions of others and demonstrating a listening ear
backed with action.
Experiment
A traditional source of dissatisfaction between business and IT teams
is that the cost of IT services compared to the value of goods and services
rendered is unequally proportioned. Business teams have an interest in
experimenting with ideas, and as discussed they do not have time for
long, drawn out, software implementations, nor do they want to pay
excessive costs. There is generally a sense of urgency when it comes to
experimentation since the results drive other business decisions. This is
why pilot programs, where work is not thrown away but rather provides
a foundation for further business solutions, are becoming more pro-
found. Proof of concepts (PoC) is still viable, but work can be thrown
away since the PoC is more focused on proving out a technology than
solving business problems. Cloud facilitates experimentation with its
ability to quickly provision and decommission test environments as
needed. Rather than committing to a major investment in software and
hardware, the business unit commits and leverages a pilot program sub-
scribing to ready-made service offerings required to validate the business
solution.
If, by reading the previous paragraph, there is a conclusion drawn
that IT teams are not interested in conducting pilots, well that is not
the case. In traditional IT environments, IT teams might have a more
difficult time obtaining the funds to conduct pilot work unless funding
is provided by business units or work is planned into the budget early
enough so that resources get allocated and adequately assigned. This
challenge is presented because the assets to be acquired to conduct pilots
are just as significant an investment as the assets required for larger
projects—meaning software, hardware, and information sources typi-
cally have to be purchased or leased and installed. In essence, IT teams
are interested in business technologies and driving strategic direction
for organizations. What is challenging in traditional environments,
which must change with newer delivery models, is the inability to take
time away from an already overloaded schedule to experiment or pilot
initiatives.
Cloud remedies experimentation related issues as just described in
several ways: Pay as you go or subscription style service offerings can be

A: Augmenting Your Delivery Model with Cloud
263
expensed as operational or discretionary spending as opposed to
unplanned capital overlays that would be difficult to fund in an out of
budget cycle; the cost of cloud solutions is typically less expensive than
traditional purchases, which may help your business case; and cloud
gives you the opportunity to experiment or “try before you buy” in a
controlled environment, affording you the opportunity to test the viabil-
ity of your ideas before strategic decisions are made that can be more dif-
ficult to reverse once the undertaking commences.
Act
You collaborated to gain insights into business, customer, and market
opportunities, focusing on improving communication and collaboration
throughout your company, and you experimented to understand the via-
bility of alternative delivery models and solutions. The final step, which
is probably the most important of all, is to swiftly act! In other words,
take what you have learned and quickly put it to work. Each of these
steps—whether labeled as such or not—are what you can expect to see
demonstrated in your cloud augmented delivery model.
At this point, it is well understood that cloud as well as outsourcing
both add to your ability to allocate internal resources from routine activ-
ities to more strategic, value-centric assignments. So what are some
example value-centric assignments? Strategy and planning of the serv-
ices catalog that you will consume and possibly resell for profit is an
example and important strategic initiative that you would want to
ensure that your organization leads. Other examples include conducting
market analysis to establish your client base and growth segments, mas-
ter data management (MDM), business/information intelligence and
information dash-boarding—meaning the creation of dashboards that
measure key business and IT metrics, such as customer satisfaction levels
and time to market.
To support the augmented delivery model, match the IT and business
talents of your teams to tasks and consider implementing intern pro-
grams to expose IT personnel to the full range of enterprise operations
and cloud opportunities. Expect business buyers to show interest in
cloud augmented delivery models. Referencing the Brand/TCP business
scenario discussed in previous sections, develop strategic and tactical
plans to renew legacy systems, hardware, and software. Take advantage
of cloud to standardize the IT infrastructure and automated related busi-
ness processes organizationwide. Take advantage of dashboards that

264
leverage data collected to measure key business and IT metrics, includ-
ing ROI and revenue, customer satisfaction levels and other information
including response time/time to market, system availability/downtimes,
and employee satisfaction.
Summary
To keep pace with the accelerated changes brought about by business
complexities, emerging economies, and competitive business landscapes,
executives and technology leaders are augmenting their traditional
delivery models with cloud. This appendix discussed business considera-
tions for such augmentations.
Traditional data center business risks that resided with the IT organi-
zation have shifted to an integrated cloud service provider and consumer
shared risk model with mixed and variable financial models that help
offset data center costs. At the same time, server communications are
improving so that data centers can securely connect to other data centers
within and external to cloud and effectively share resources. Discussed
was the notion of shrinking data centers, the application of Just-In-Time
(JIT) business patterns, along with building sustainability and how
cloud can contribute to energy and environmental efficiencies.
Other delivery models that might be augmented with cloud deploy-
ments including BPaaS, SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS were discussed and are
summarized in Table A.2. Example topics include the impacts of cloud
on global delivery models and the value-add when businesses adopt an
IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) approach to solution design and delivery where
you start with what is in your data center, look at where you want to go,
and focus on how to get there. If something is not what or where it
should be, for example, Web applications are not performing as
expected, you fix the situation hopefully before it catches the attention
of your end users. That may mean using cloud or taking other steps.
In an ITaaS model, you treat your business units as customers. Your
focus is to keep your customers happy and thus keep business perform-
ance high. This does not mean that you overwhelm them with new fea-
tures that they may or may not use, but it does mean that you consider
realizable and meaningful business value and act accordingly. This may
mean outsourcing services to cloud, and it may mean keeping the capa-
bility in-house.

described were key cloud roles and responsibilities that will likely aug-
ment traditional roles and responsibilities. Collaborate, experiment, and
act is a common theme and welcomed addition to augmenting tradi-
tional delivery methods with cloud.

This appendix contains additional examples and analysis of cloud adoption deci-
sions that were made with and without the use of EA. Incorporated are some common
questions relative to cloud adoption that are asked and answered. Commentary
throughout this appendix includes lessons learned from project experiences.
Private Cloud Adoption: Two South African Case Studies
These private cloud adoption case studies are based on two IBM cus-
tomers in South Africa. The first is a large bank that experienced ineffi-
cient application of infrastructure environments and inadequate
governance. The second is a large cell phone company that became inun-
dated with preproduction virtual and physical environments.

A Large Bank
The benefits to the bank from installation of a private cloud for test
and development capacity are indicated in the following list:
■Robust governance and scheduling process for test environments.
■Eliminated test server waste due to lack of governance and management.
■Provided a cloud scheduling process to release servers when testing is
completed.
■Provided much faster setup of test systems. The bank reported that test
system setup that previously took two weeks now takes two hours.
■Savings to customers due to cutting physical servers in half and optimiz-
ing environments to achieve better usage.
The Application Integration and Security team at the bank is respon-
sible for setting up and maintaining the different SOA server environ-
ments required to support projects. These environments include
development and test, quality assurance, and production as well as disas-
ter recovery environments. Each of these environments may include one
or more suites of middleware such as DB2® databases, WebSphere®
process server (WPS) clusters, WebSphere application server (WAS)
clusters and WebSphere message broker clusters among others.
Building and maintaining these environments involve a multitude of
tasks that required coordination and performance by various teams. The
main teams involved were as follows:
■Infrastructure team manages the server hardware setup, logical partition-
ing, and network setup.
■AIX® support team manages AIX installations, patches, configuration,
and settings.
■Open systems storage team is responsible for allocating storage resources.
■DB2 support team manages database creation and administration.
■Data security team is responsible for security aspects such as creating
authorized users on systems.
■Application integration and security team requests the computing
resources from the teams mentioned above to perform their own software
installation.

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
269
Each of these teams performed a variety of other duties as part of their
job, which resulted in working durations for any given deployment
being significantly longer than the estimated duration for completing
assignments. While each team involved may perform their tasks effi-
ciently, the nature of the manual processes along with the hand-offs
between teams inevitably added costs and delays to projects resulting in
an additional two weeks for a system to be set up correctly in a single
environment.
EA governance and a cloud computing platform was collectively
applied to resolve the issues above including enterprise integration of
cloud solutions and more effective coordination of team communica-
tions. Establishment of decision rights among team members, standards
pertaining to provisioning and decommissioning environments, and
image management became enterprise standards.
The cloud platform now dynamically provisions, configures, reconfig-
ures, and decommissions test and development servers as needed and
provides the following capabilities:
■Provide self-service interface that can be provided to anyone in the organ-
ization, alleviating the need for complex engagements with the IT
department every time a new environment is required.
■Orchestrate and track the provisioning and decommissioning of related
resources such as networking, storage, and computing resources as a sin-
gle project. Project deployment and cleanup are performed as specified by
a calendar.
■Manage the automated installation and configuration of complex software
topologies and applications. This also provides visibility into the method
and steps used to create any given environment configuration.
Administrator sign-off is required before deployment can begin, which
provides controlled usage of the cloud.
■Reduce the risk of deployment errors with fast and automatic deploy-
ment of environments, since all complex configurations are performed up
front and not at deployment time.
■Provide dependency validation for software installations. For example,
given a particular platform and OS, what is the software that can be
installed?
■Monitor server utilization in real time to provide an accurate view of
project resource usage.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
270
■Help system administrators estimate capacity demand early, which allows
the business to proactively assign more computing resources to the cloud.
■Host a variety of different workloads, including batch-style back-end jobs
and interactive, user-facing applications.
The booking, scheduling, and management of machines is now done
through a Web-based interface. The Web interface gives an overview of
the entire cloud infrastructure, including which projects are currently
defined and how many resources each project uses or will use in the case
of future projects. A consolidated view of available and utilized resources
in the cloud is also shown through the use of real-time monitoring.
A Cell Phone Company
The cell phone company was experiencing typical concerns for large
companies with their test environments. The concerns include
■Test environment resource availability. This was for both hardware and
people resource, especially for end-to-end testing.
■There was no good scheduling process for shared resources.
■There was a significant amount of test server waste due to lack of gover-
nance and management. For example, every project received servers (vir-
tual and sometimes physical environments) for testing; however, the
servers were often not released once testing initiatives completed.
A private cloud was proposed and accepted that would manage the
company’s virtualized test environments. The private cloud would be
used to provide tight governance around automated provisioning and
decommissioning of environments allocated to projects. Based on their
analysis, the cloud proposal team believed a private cloud for test and
development environments would offer the company benefits in the
form of:
■Greatly reduced time to procure test servers/systems
■Allow tight scheduling and governance of test systems
■Significantly reduced number of servers used for test
■Significantly reduced number of people resources for test

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
271
■Reduced test server waste that is due to poor governance and management
■Elimination of cloud security concerns since the private cloud is installed
at the customer’s data center
During 2010, the cell phone company’s South Africa IT landscape
continued to increase in size and complexity, with analysis as follows:
■1100+ Server Instances—The number of instances has grown exponen-
tially over the past five years.
■40 percent to 60 percent incline in estimated spend on maintaining cur-
rent IT infrastructures versus adding new capabilities.
■87.03 percent average server idle times. The company has an average of
12.97 percent CPU usage across platforms while test CPU is even lower.
The following is the preproduction analysis and technical refresh con-
siderations prior to cloud adoption:
■An estimated 42 percent of servers are used in preproduction roles.
■Preproduction servers consume up to 40 percent of power and cooling
(339,509 Watts out of 855,025 total consumption for all environments).
■There are 231 servers expected to reach end of life capacity and perform-
ance within the next six months distributed as follows:
■
149 Windows® servers. Approximately 80 will be in preproduc-
tion/staging.
■
44 AIX servers. Approximately 25 will be in
preproduction/staging.
■
38 Linux® servers. Approximately 20 will be in
preproduction/staging.

IBM proposed a private cloud solution to address the company needs
that was approved and currently being implemented; here is a summary:
■Private cloud will manage the company’s virtualized preproduction envi-
ronments.
■Integrate into the company’s cloud and overarching IT governance
processes.
■The approach is to commence with an entry-level system that provides 
an entire framework and three working HS22 blades to host around 
3 ∞8 = 24 concurrent virtual machines (assuming one core per VM) and
five terabytes of storage. One Blade will be used for CloudBurst®.1
NOTE
A technique based on private cloud workloads, cloud bursting, leverages
hosted or public cloud resources in support of private cloud workload
demands. If the private cloud has the capacity, any hosted or public cloud
capacity is not used. In this scenario, IBM offered CloudBurst as a part of
the total private cloud solution.

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
273
■Scale by buying more HS22 blades, up to 14 in the BladeCenter®. This
gives 13 × 8 = 104 concurrent VMs (assuming one core per VM, and one
blade for management). An additional BladeCenter can be added.
■CloudBurst has the capability to manage external hardware as part of the
cloud. This capability could be leveraged as an option to expand capacity.
■Enhance service management capabilities to bring awareness to environ-
ments that are not in use and reallocate.

tion development and test environments were moved to a private cloud,
the number of physical servers could be reduced by 62 percent. The time
(days) to provision the test environments could be reduced from 33 days
to 5.4 days, and the number of test team members needed to provision
the environments would go from 16 to 2. Much of the projected savings
is due to reduced labor required for test, development, and operational

expenses typically incurred during setup, configuration, and mainte-
nance of environments. Savings are also associated with a reduction in
the required software licenses.
Overall, in these two case studies, private cloud adoption with
applied governance (an EA principle) provided a way to greatly improve
test and development environments for speed in setup and configura-
tion, generating savings in hardware, software, and labor expenditures.
The EA teams that included senior level stakeholders developed, stan-
dardized, and enforced cloud adoption and usage guidelines throughout
the company.
Enterprise Reference Architecture and Private Cloud
Adoption: Case Study
This example demonstrates the value of developing an enterprise ref-
erence architecture that incorporates cloud.
An international financial services company is building foundational
enterprise reference architectures to control how IT teams build, deploy,
run, and manage IT environments along with the products and services
deployed in the environments. This financial services company provides
solutions to customers that encompass fraud protection, check guarantee
and verification services, and Internet commerce. One particular service
offering is situational based card services where customer credit lines are
automatically increased or deactivated based on buyer behaviors.
The company initially worked with a provider to develop a private
cloud solution; however, there were significant amounts of performance
related issues along with an inability to customize solutions to meet
business demands without excessive costs. The CTO expressed that sim-
ilar experiences “could not be repeated” and turned to a different cloud
provider for new services. Regrouping its service delivery approach, the
company placed emphasis on definition of an enterprise reference archi-
tecture (derived from EA) that includes standards, business and IT gov-
ernance, process management, formalized development and test
environments, documentation rigor, and artifacts related to product
development, operations, and control. The anticipated private cloud
workloads are compute or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and utility
services such as Storage-as-a-Service, automated backups, and archival
services.

278
The company believes that the enterprise reference architecture is
critical in providing the following:
■Alignment of business and architecture objectives and solution delivery
■Support of situational-aware analytical solutions and services
■Capacity to perform during workload variability
■Development of architectural principles and standards for security, data
access, integration, and other application development domains for
hybrid cloud and traditional environments
■Design, development, and performance best practices for integrating
cloud into the enterprise
■Development of cloud specific infrastructure designs that must be incor-
porated into network, security, server, storage, virtualization, and manag-
ing infrastructure that now encompasses cloud
■Enterprise service-oriented solutions
■Framework in which all support and development activities center
■Governance framework that manages cloud and the integration of legacy
systems
■Integrated security framework that guides Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) and other regulatory compliance
■Framework that becomes self-documenting to speed on-ramp of new
development resources, as well as enhance the experiences of existing
development resources
Published Criteria for Provider Selection
The following are published criteria used by the consumer to select
cloud provider(s):
■Proven ability to integrate front-end and back-end solutions, including
cloud.
■Experience defining and implementing enterprise architecture (EA),
applying a structured method to identify business technologies, and
developing enterprise cloud roadmaps for private consumption.

Smarter Education: Cloud Case Study
This example demonstrates the value of cloud as an enabler of virtual
data centers.
A large U.S.-based university was experiencing significant growth
and increased demands on academic computing resources. The need for
increased compute capacity to support a continually growing user base,
tailored course curriculum, and application requirements, as well as the
need to provide service levels that meet customer requirements was
exposed as a business risk.
Challenges surfaced when working with IT teams to prepare course
images, install in the labs, and ensure that all applications integrated
smoothly. And because it took so long to perform the necessary integrations,
IT teams imposed deadlines on instructors that were due months before
course terms were to commence. As a result, instructors had to wait as long
as a year to get the latest applications in the hands of students.
The university introduced a provisioning framework that enabled self-
service provisioning of a managed yet virtual computing lab.2 Users are now
able to access environments from anywhere, which allows them to conduct
work from dorm rooms or at home, as opposed to having to go to the univer-
sity lab to complete assignments. Users can select an application image (con-
sisting of the operating system and a suite of applications) either for current
use or future use, at a set time and for a set duration. Instructors can create
block reservations for an entire class, reserve clusters of servers, and even add

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
280
new applications without the assistance of IT staff. Once a scheduled session
is over, service automation causes a user’s virtual environment to be wiped
clean, enabling unused blades to be put back in the resource pool for further
consumption.
Projected Business Benefits
The projected business benefits as listed are substantial. It is impor-
tant to note the alignment and traceability of the core business problem
to the solution so that value is realized across the enterprise, or in this
case, across university campuses.
■Savings in software licensing costs of up to 75 percent
■150 percent increase in students served per application license
■Higher student satisfaction through more convenient access
■Improved access to the most recent software releases for instructors
■Increased flexibility to shift computing capacity between instructional,
research, and administrative needs
■The ability to meet significant growth in enrollment without building
additional computer labs
Serious Games: Cloud Case Study (Hybrid: Public and
Private Model)
This example demonstrates the value of cloud as an enterprise enabler
of serious games.
Large Transportation Business (LTB) is experiencing significant busi-
ness challenges. In particular, the CEO has expressed that real-world
issues such as traffic congestion during natural disasters must be han-
dled better and more efficiently. In the current environment, for
instance, should a crisis such as a city blackout occur, LTB is known to
lose communications with all vehicles along with the whereabouts of
employees and passengers. To meet LTB’s long-term goals, a serious
gaming solution was designed with a cloud platform. A phased imple-
mentation approach would grow use of the game and mature the organi-
zation relative to using gaming technologies to solve complex business

B.5 illustrates the solution.
In Phase 1, LTB established a cloud platform for engaging single and
multi players. LTB chose an initial public cloud model to take advan-
tage of existing SaaS services that would support the gaming initiative.
Public cloud consumption is allowed in subsequent phases for nonpro-
prietary game use.
In Phase 2, a supply chain management game that mimics actual
business processes is enabled to support operational decision making.
This solution is comprised of enterprise systems integration powered by
SOA that runs on a private cloud platform since data at this stage is
classified as confidential to the company. The following is the high level
implementation strategy:

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
282
■LTB scenario-based skills development: Create a single and multi-
player game that offers preset supply chain scenarios that the player must
complete. These scenarios start easy and become progressively more diffi-
cult depending on the player’s performance. Accounts are created for the
players to keep track of their progress via learning management solutions.
■LTB serious games platform for operational use: A proprietary gam-
ing platform can be used for broad enterprise operational use. Enabled by
streaming live data feeds from different data sources, this platform helps
users attain a number of objectives, including real-time visualization,
optimized modeling, the collaboration around a complex logistics prob-
lem, and event driven scenarios that are invoked by different suppliers to
improve situational awareness and readiness for planned and unexpected
incidents.
■Example game rules: Players access a public cloud platform initially fol-
lowed with a more secure model as business scenarios become more sig-
nificant and proprietary to the organization. A Game Master (GM)
instantiates a geographic instance of a game and selects a region. The GM
then decides which suppliers to invite. Suppliers must work together to
meet the requirements of the GM, which will be derived from a business
scenario. The GM can then create an event that will affect the supply
chain (e. g., a hurricane) or a city blackout.
A summary of the business benefits for LTB are as follows:
■Playful yet serious transportation scenarios and preparation to handle
unexpected events.
■Enterprise business process optimization through review and application
of LTB’s EA with a concerted effort on the business architecture domain
as it contains process and event models.
■More efficient handling and simplified access to large data sets due to the
cloud platform.
■Analytics measurements that consider human as well as the technological
elements, such as metrics tracking of how well personnel are learning
and applying knowledge gained to real-life experiences and business
problems.
■Greater performance monitoring of players and their capabilities prior to
and after playing the game. Performance dashboards are tailored for all
ranks within the organization from senior executives to practitioners.

Business Influencers and Drivers of Cloud Adoption
With the rapid emergence of new technologies such as cloud, it is
important for business executives and stakeholders to focus on the real
business challenges and the needs of the enterprise. By examining some
of the key business problems that are prompting companies to use cloud,
it is possible to build a stronger business case for adoption.
We have explored many different use cases for cloud from several
industries and found common drivers throughout. The use cases demon-
strate business value through optimizing resources, lowering costs, and
providing solutions on-demand when and where customers, partners,
and employees need it. The following are eight key business reasons that
businesses are adopting cloud followed with two business use cases. You
can find more details on Pam Isom’s blog3 and in the whitepaper,
“Strengthening Your Business Case for Using Cloud.”4 This paper was
published by The Open Group and ongoing revisions are planned.
■Ability to consolidate information across disparate systems with complete
transparency to the user
■Ability to modernize business systems at a low cost and fast speed of
deployment
■Ability to move to a remote desktop services model using the cloud
■Need to support high storage capacity requirements
■Rapid deployment emerges as a consistent business value theme
■Ability to provide IT using self-service capabilities
■Need to support mobile services
■Need to support internal and external collaboration for employees and
partners
Table B.1 and Table B.2 present two scenarios from the collection of
use cases. The examples indicate the primary purpose of cloud adoption
and the business requirements that influenced cloud adoption decisions.
Both scenarios reside within the category of business assurance.

21 Common Cloud Questions and Responses
As cloud emerges as a subject of great interest, many questions
accompany it. This section offers questions you might ask and answers
that will anchor successful cloud experiences for you:
1. Is the development of an enterprise cloud adoption strategy augmenting EA
applicable to the small business as well?
Yes. The context of enterprise applied in this book has nothing to
do with the size of your company. It has to do with your holistic
view of developing a strategy that allows you to anticipate, prepare,
and solve business problems in a way that your company reaps
immediate and long-term benefits. When vetting providers, you
should ask about their EA strategy and how they intend to help you
integrate cloud with your existing systems. A cloud provider with
an integrated EA is more likely to have the proper foundation and
controls in place to grow with your business as well as adequate
governance to support your dynamic business requirements.
Likewise, you should validate and reference your own EA capabili-
ties including governance, security, integration, and performance
for cloud service and enablement decisions. Without which, issues
with sustaining your cloud adoption and maximizing its value may
surface.
2. Is there a particular business area that our company must pay close attention
to when it comes to consuming cloud services?
Billing and customer relationship management are common
processes for cloud adoption. You need to understand who and how
you will be billed for services that you consume, you must under-
stand whether there is a standardized payment gateway or whether
you will rely on your provider’s payment gateway, and your provider
should have certified billing and security measures that guarantee
against fraudulent activities. The impact of your provider’s capabil-
ity is closely linked to customer relationship management and serv-
ice excellence. It is better to address these considerations early on,
during the strategy phase.
3. What are some lessons learned from cloud projects?
While the IT capabilities of cloud are significant, organizations can
achieve higher returns if they focus on the business value of cloud

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
287
adoption with an emphasis on applying the capability for business
efficiency, expediency, and agility. This has been challenging for
organizations that perceive cloud as purely an IT play because the
business units struggle with recognizing the impacts to their organ-
izations.
Traditional solution methodologies can be too time consuming and
require excessive paperwork, but at the same time you cannot ignore
requirements gathering, testing, and formal documentation. When the
right balance goes unmet it generates issues for all parties involved
including delayed implementations.
Executive sponsorship and leadership is essential for not only driv-
ing cloud adoption but driving the right business model with cloud
providers so that investment risks and rewards are fair and adequate.
Proof-of-concepts and demonstrations are not production-ready
deliverables; you and your providers need to call a spade a spade so
that realistic project expectations are established and managed
appropriately.
Buyers and sellers need to communicate expectations and the value
of cloud in business speak. There remains a growth opportunity in
this arena—this book provides guidance on the subject.
When you are accustomed to operating in a traditional hosted man-
ner, it can be difficult to change. One way to guide adaptation is to
maintain your traditional environment as a contingency until cloud
environments are proven; and by all means, do not overlook the
value and necessity of quality assuring the interoperability cloud
solutions in your environment.
Finally, some organizations don’t shoot high enough in terms of
what’s possible to do for business value in adopting cloud comput-
ing.
4. What are industry verticals and what is the market potential for cloud?
A vertical cloud aims at addressing the needs of a given business
within a vertical market. Some example vertical clouds are those
developed to support healthcare services. Other examples are auto-
motive, manufacturing, and banking specific cloud solutions.
Vertical markets are an excellent opportunity for cloud consumers
because of the specialized, expert capability that is available to you.
Such markets are also, at this time, an excellent opportunity for
providers, since the cloud market currently is not overly saturated
with such capabilities.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
288
A horizontal market is a market that meets the needs of a variety of
industries, rather than a specific industry. Storage and compute as a
service are example horizontal cloud solutions. Horizontal markets
are the norm and present excellent business opportunities for cloud
consumers and providers. Your challenge will be choosing from
among the various cloud offerings, which means you need to ensure
that select services align to your business strategy, goals, and 
objectives.
5. What is the role of communications service providers (CSPs) and cloud?
CSPs are well-positioned to capitalize on this new market opportu-
nity using the assets they already have in place such as networks,
customer connections, brand strength, strong service levels, and
management of small and large customer base. CSPs are good candi-
dates for cloud consumption as well as becoming a provider because
of their foundation. Some key capabilities required for CSPs to
remain successful in the cloud market are
■Extensive product development and marketing experience with
numerous sales channels to leverage and promote your cloud offer-
ings. You can consider offering fewer products with more features or
you might consider offering more products with fewer features. You
also need to consider pricing strategies that work for you. For
instance we know that with cloud a benefit is consumption based
pricing, but exactly how should that work for you and your organiza-
tion. Does it make sense to offer subscription style services, or is it
more efficient to charge per use down to the minute? You have to
consider the cost to enable this capability, your target market, as well
as the payback.
■Customer data handling including demographics, billing, and credit
information for postpaid accounts, service subscription information,
usage data, and personalization are some examples.
■A strong brand where you are known for financial stability, local
community presence, secure maintenance of customer data, and
respect for privacy.
■Highly scalable/high volume networks and systems to guarantee
highly automated service fulfillment and customer care.

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
289
■Strong regional market position and perception as a trusted service
provider.
■Establish partnerships with competitors as well as friends, and
develop an ability to integrate third-party applications and services
into your service portfolio.
6. What are your experiences with SMBs and cloud adoption?
Our experiences are pretty consistent with published industry
reports in that small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) are rapid
adopters of cloud computing, particularly in the Business Process-as-
a-Service (BPaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Infrastructure-
as-a-Service (IaaS) areas for compute and storage services. Virtual
desktops, at least with my clients, are starting to gain momentum.
SMBs typically look for lightweight, mobile solutions to control
costs and maintain client responsiveness. If you recall the situation
of the small business owner named “Jack” in Chapter 1, “Business
Value of a Cloud Adoption Strategy,” then you can relate to the fact
that SMBs are not particularly interested in all of the bells and
whistles because they generally have a smaller budget. They are
instead focused on affordable services that they need to drive value
and client impacts. If SMBs can consume services at a fraction of the
cost that it would take to build a data center or create applications
they will and are doing so. You can find more on this subject in the
epilogue.
7. What can my company do to prepare for cloud even though adoption is not
an immediate goal?
It is a good idea to ready your organization for cloud before you
attempt to implement. You can take actions such as research strate-
gic advantages that your adoption will bring and ensure that you
have adequate network capability. You should educate your teams
on cloud, review lessons learned from other companies, and start to
review your EA domains including business, applications, informa-
tion systems, and technology/infrastructure architectural building
blocks (ABBs) to see where cloud adoption makes sense and to
determine the foundational components to put in place. Reading
about case studies and engaging with your peers is another great
pursuit for readiness. Materials throughout this book will help you
ready your organization whether your decision is to move forward
with cloud adoption today or tomorrow.

8. What are some financial advantages to consider?
For the CFO, the challenge is to think of new ways to utilize tech-
nology in the business that helps deliver the strategic objective of
the company but at an acceptable cost. Removing the burden of rou-
tine maintenance and management and accessing business applica-
tions via cloud offers enterprise stakeholders a prime opportunity to
refocus energy on more strategic aspects of business and IT opera-
tions, freeing up time and resources, which can be used on growing
the business.5
Essentially, cloud shifts the business model for the customer from
the high capital expenses of a physical data center and hardware,
which are now the investment of the cloud provider, to operational
expenses via a subscription or usage based business model. For users,
cloud arrangements can bring about cost reductions and data center
efficiencies.
If a user needs temporary additional space, they can simply tell the
cloud service provider to up his quota for the time being, rather
than purchase additional physical capacity, which would only be
needed for a short period and then left idle.6 This also means that
computer resources as a whole are generally used more efficiently,
contributing to greener, leaner, and more optimized data centers.
This topic is expounded in Chapter 8, “Financial Considerations,”
where the impact of an enterprise cloud adoption strategy furthers
financial benefits and mitigates financial risk.
9. There is a fear factor around security in public cloud implementations.
What are some of the concerns, and how are cloud service providers securing
their public clouds?
One source of comfort is to recognize the subject matter expertise
that is required of cloud service providers. Many specialize in secu-
rity and ensuring reliable cloud solutions as this is the core of their
business model. On the other hand, cloud adoption does not elimi-
nate the need for security. Cloud providers should proactively offer
cloud security strategy and road map solutions to help guide clients
through the security and privacy concerns of their cloud initiatives.
When users place data and applications on centralized servers, they
lose the ability to maintain complete control of that information.
With the rise in the adoption of cloud, critical and sometimes sensi-
tive information that was once safely stored on personal computers
now resides on the servers of online companies. Examples of such

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
291
information include users’ e-mail accounts, banking information,
and full backups of individuals’ hard drives. One of the biggest risks
of storing data in the cloud is the possibility that data will be
accessed by unwanted parties. While some cloud services encrypt
user data when it is stored, you have to ensure that the right levels
of encryption are applied. Some providers store data in clear text,
leaving data especially vulnerable to security breaches.
Data stored in the cloud might also be provided to marketers.
According to a report by the Pew Internet and American Life
Project, 90 percent of cloud application users say they would be very
concerned if the company storing their data sold it to a third party,
80 percent of users say they would be very concerned if companies
used their photos or other data in marketing campaigns, and 68 per-
cent say they would be very concerned if companies that provided
these services analyzed their information and then displayed ads to
them based on their actions. You can find more on this subject in
Chapter 6, “Mitigating Risk.”
10. What types of workloads are being deployed on public and private clouds?
Typical entry points for public cloud workloads include those for
collaboration such as instant messaging, Web conferencing, e-mail,
idea management, and file sharing or those that are self-contained.
Typical entry points for private cloud workloads include those that
have a significant amount of interaction between various compo-
nents that can’t be moved immediately to a public cloud, and those
workloads with regulatory compliance and/or proprietary informa-
tion requirements. Along with determining public and private
workloads, here are some common application considerations for
consumers when it comes to determining cloud candidates (these
application-specific considerations augment the content that was
discussed in Chapter 4, “Identifying Cloud Candidates.”
■There are multiple users (preferably across business units) for the
service.
■Services are loosely coupled which makes them more interoperable
and vendor and device agnostic.
■There is a geographical reach if required (e.g., language support and
capacity for consumption).
■Services comply with corporate information security and regulatory
requirements.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
292
■The lifetime of existing, replacement services is nearing retirement
and/or service warranties are expiring.
■There is a favorable cost and user experience.
■There is help desk support according to your specifications.
11. Are there common workloads that are fit for cloud?
Yes. Some common workloads are
■Application development and test
■Business intelligence and decision support services
■Business applications
■Collaborative services
■Archival, storage, and information retrieval services
■Disaster recovery services
■High performance computing
■IT infrastructure/hosting
■Web infrastructure/hosting
12. Should companies do away with their data centers and move everything to
cloud?
Some companies are looking to minimize their IT investments, and
moving workloads to the cloud is a viable option, especially with
startup companies with minimal IT requirements that want to
leverage the scalability. Established IT organizations will look to
leverage cloud for some but not all content, and as discussed there is
a move toward enterprise applications into cloud. Cloud offerings
are maturing, and you should keep in mind that not all workloads—
for example, some legacy applications—are suited for cloud. You
should also be mindful that while you can minimize hardware pur-
chases by using a pay per use model, not all of your hardware needs
can be addressed via cloud.
13. How much should I expect to save from moving to cloud?
The amount of savings depends on how constrained you are with
your data center and legacy resources. Those that do not require a
large data center investment will find cloud savings to be signifi-
cant up front and downstream, such as cost avoidance from having
to build new data centers or expand existing servers and infrastruc-
ture. The case studies in this appendix offer specific examples of
experienced benefits and projections including a total ROI of 300

B: Cloud Case Studies and Common Questions
293
percent or greater. You can find more financial discussions associ-
ated with planning your cloud adoption in Chapter 8.
14. How do I compensate for network connectivity, availability, and response as
I move workloads out to the public cloud, which has to interact with our
distributed workforce and retained IT workloads?
The same network techniques that an IT organization has been
using for data center consolidation can be applied to public cloud.
At a high level, you need to make sure that there is sufficient net-
work bandwidth between the public cloud location and your 
customers interacting with the cloud. Network measurements 
for response time and latency should be taken as part of providing a
quality service. Workloads with noninteractive traffic are better
suited for centralization. Network techniques such as WAN acceler-
ation and content caching can be used to complement application
changes to leverage centralized IT workloads. Chapter 7, “Planning
the Transition,” describes some lessons learned from a project and
some key network considerations.
15. What are some key integration considerations when it comes to adopting
cloud?
You have to consider the integration of cloud with your existing
business processes, applications, data, and security. For example,
your enterprise application portfolio, upon SaaS adoption, is
extended, and your portfolio must be governed accordingly. In turn
you might assign a CTO that is dedicated to managing external
cloud providers; there is an element of organizational knowledge
transfer and training associated with cloud that you will need to
address; and most cloud solutions come with a front-end user inter-
face or dashboard. You will want to establish a plan for integrating
that interface with your existing dashboards. Many companies, for
instance, require that their current dashboard remain visible to end
users while others require branding of the cloud-provided user
interface to meet corporate standards. This topic is discussed from
both a business integration and technology integration perspective
in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, “Business Value of Incorporating Cloud
into Your EA.”
16. How will the public cloud content we created be integrated with the system
management solution (products and governance) that I have in place for my
existing IT content?

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
294
In general, the same tools that a company uses for system manage-
ment today can be used in the public cloud environment. As part of
installing the system management tools on your public cloud work-
load, a company should feed information from the cloud into its
existing system management infrastructure to avoid having to
maintain multiple system management implementations. This is
one of the reasons why this book emphasizes building cloud into
your EA, which encompasses system management and governance.
You can find more information on this subject in Chapter 5, “What
About Governance?.”
17. We understand the technical benefits of cloud and rapid provisioning and
all; what are some example business benefits?
The case studies shared in this appendix are intended to provide
some example business benefits (of which the technical benefits are
also incorporated). Some specific business advantages to using cloud
are
■Increased customer satisfaction due to rapid access to services and
tools (e. g., social media) that are required to solve complex business
problems
■Increased client base and market share
■Improved analyses and business intelligence
■Self-service capabilities (end user empowerment)
■Rapid problem solving and teamwork
■Reduced operational costs
■Improved business agility
■Sustainable cloud usage and structured proliferation across your com-
pany
18. What is the difference between cloud reference architecture and enterprise
reference architecture?
Cloud reference architecture emphasizes the architecture and com-
ponents required to build a cloud solution. An enterprise reference
architecture is derived from EA; it describes your enterprise strategy
for designing and implementing solutions end to end and encom-
passes or references your cloud reference architecture.
19. What are some contributors to unsuccessful cloud projects?
The omission of a clearly defined cloud adoption strategy can lead to
haphazard adoption of cloud solutions or an over proliferation of

cloud environments as was discussed in the South African case study
presented earlier in this chapter. This may not make the project
unsuccessful per se, put it does contribute to a difficult portfolio to
manage and unnecessary costs, both of which diminish your busi-
ness agility and performance.
Lack of a clearly articulated and published service catalog and pricing
model is a red flag for problems. This portfolio should be developed at
the onset. Some clients are anxious to onboard cloud solutions and do
not seem to give the pricing model much thought. Some do not under-
stand the potential for profitability and should insist that providers
team and discuss the possibilities.
As with traditional projects, mismanaged expectations between con-
sumers and providers are contributors to related problems on cloud
engagements. Clearly articulated service level requirements, service
level agreements, and operational level agreements (SLAs, SLOs, and
OLAs) are all significant and not only must be established but also
governed.
Another contributor to unsuccessful projects is security, basics such
as ensuring that your provider conducts ethical hacking of the vir-
tual environments that they provision is often overlooked. Chapter 4
provides top-down analysis and approaches to developing your
enterprise cloud adoption strategy; and Chapter 6 provides insights
for addressing some security related matters.
20. What is the role of the CIO when it comes to cloud?
The CIO generally reports to the CEO or CFO and is responsible for
ensuring that a vision and integrated business and IT strategy are
established and executed appropriately within your organization.
Your CIO might direct you to adopt specific cloud solutions, or she
might assign this responsibility to your CTO and chief enterprise
architect, but ultimately the CIO is (or should be) accountable.
21. How does cloud fit within my SOA strategy?
Cloud is an expansion and realization of your SOA strategy. Three
points follow to further this topic.
First, there is a high degree of commonality between cloud and a
service oriented architecture (SOA) strategy and as we progress
toward an environment where almost everything is available as a
service, we need to consider adding cloud to our overarching SOA
strategy as an information, orchestration and integration channel
and potentially as an Integration-as-a-Service capability.

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
296
Second, the essential characteristics for cloud (on-demand self-service,
broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured
services) are optional for SOA and mandatory for cloud and cloud
architectures require a set of capabilities and architectural building
blocks (ABBs) to meet these characteristics.
Third, considering that SOA decomposes your business technology
landscape into loosely coupled functional services, you can take
advantage of established SOA decisions and leverage cloud to
deploy or realize those identified business services. And just as with
EA, you can expand your SOA governance model to incorporate
cloud considerations.
Summary
Networking and collaborating with the competition to develop a
partnership is one way to grow your business and one example of con-
tent discussed in this appendix. Understanding market opportunities
and establishing adequate price points for cloud service offerings is
another decision point. It is always good to connect with stakeholders to
gain an appreciation of the motivators behind business decisions, as well
as to gain an understanding of any experienced and projected benefits.
The same is true when it comes to cloud-specific decision making. As a
form of knowledge share for those that may be contemplating cloud
adoption or looking to progress the use of cloud within your company,
this appendix offers some referential case studies.
As we experience a turning point from an early adopter cloud mental-
ity to a focus on enterprise sustainability, you probably have numerous
questions about cloud and developing your strategy for adoption.
Bearing this thought in mind, this appendix presents a list of 21 com-
mon questions asked and answered from our experience.

Everybody in this room understands that our nation’s success depends on
strengthening America’s role as the world’s engine of discovery and innovation.
We’re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the
nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In America,
innovation doesn’t just change our lives. It is how we make our living.
—President Barack Obama
Initial discussions on cloud business trends commenced in the epi-
logue. This appendix continues the topic with a focus on innovation and
thoughts pertaining to future usage of cloud computing.
Cloud Innovations
Innovation is a new way of doing something; a new product or service
or method.
Cloud innovation relates to using cloud to renew or improve, and
novelty is a consequence of the improvement.

Mobile and Cloud
You probably carry your mobile device everywhere and use your
device for everything—well, almost everything. For many, mobile
phones are becoming the primary portal for staying connected, learning,
banking, and a way of life. Companies use cloud to track and measure
business operations from a variety of mobile devices, and the integration
of mobile with cloud is growing because of the convenience and your
ability to use applications and data that does not have to be stored on
your device. There is also the convenience of device independence since
assets consumed reside in the cloud. Proprietary operating systems still
present problems for some providers, and as a result there is an upswing
to open source operating systems for greater interoperability.
This convergence can make things simpler. A case in point is both
Google’s and Amazon’s innovative music programs that allow listeners
to store music in the cloud. They essentially empower users to leverage
cloud as an external hard drive with a positive caveat—the environment
is managed and supported by someone else besides your company’s IT
department. You can expect mobile applications to continue to evolve
and move to the cloud as opposed to having to get installed and run
directly on your devices. A benefit being no downtimes due to software
upgrades since this is taken care of for you by cloud resources.
Using cloud for access ubiquity and remote storage has other advantages.
For instance, if you were to lose your mobile phone or your laptop, your
applications and data would remain accessible, and all you would require is
an ability to access the cloud environment. While we are not totally there
(some applications remain associated with specific devices), I expect cloud to
further ubiquity in the areas of access and connectivity, applications and data
centers, as well as networks so that you are able to easily conduct business
from any device, from any location, and at any time.
As mentioned in Appendix A, “Augmenting Your Delivery Model
with Cloud,” stakeholders are using social media and corporate applica-
tions, and there are explicit interests in accessing these applications
from mobile devices. CIOs and technical leaders should do what they
can to promote the use of mobile and ubiquity so that you empower
employees to bring your own (BYO) technologies, such as smart phones
and tablets. You should also count up the cost of not enabling such capa-
bility, which could mean losing key staff to competing companies.

Mobile banking is also on the rise. This includes everyday online
functions and mobile wallets. Recent reports state that the use of mobile
wallet technology among UK consumers has more than doubled in the
last 12 months with more than one in ten people now making payments
via their mobile, says “Mobile Life,” a TNS research paper into use of
mobiles in the UK. Mobile wallets allow consumers to use their phone
like a debit or credit card to pay for items online.
Gamification and Serious Games
Gamification is the use or addition of game play mechanics to appli-
cations to address a business problem. Gamification is an emerging busi-
ness trend to watch and engage. You will recognize application in
programs such as frequent flyer initiatives where points, badges, levels,
leader boards, and rewards are signals that a game of some nature is tak-
ing place.
For the purposes of this book, serious games and gamification are
applied interchangeably. The “serious” adjective implies that the game-
centric application is used by industries such as education, defense, and
healthcare for business purposes. Although serious games can be enter-
taining, their main purpose is to investigate, educate, and advertise.
A well-executed serious game utilizes established scientific insights
from design and psychology to successfully balance the development of
skills and situational awareness with progressive disclosure of real-world
challenges modeled within the game, building to proficiency within
real-world systems, such as logistics. Serious games did not originate
from video gaming, as one might think, but rather from game theory
and understanding the social and human impact of one’s decisions and
actions on a situation or event.
Adding gamification to learning and end user experiences can facili-
tate growth in education as well as productivity in the workplace.
For example, the application of gaming technologies is known to
demonstrate not only clear benefits in student engagement, attitude,
and learning intensity, but it also encourages collaboration, healthy
competition, and detailed learning.
Companies are adopting cloud to facilitate gaming experiences in
both a consumer and provider capacity. Cloud provides an open market-
place of assets, tools, vendors, and expertise as well as a platform for
hosting game-based applications, enabling rapid development, and

Is Your Company Ready for Cloud?
302
deployment of applications that for example simulate customer experi-
ences and the impacts of business process management decisions
enabling you to exercise business process models in a serious game envi-
ronment and ultimately optimize your operational effectiveness.
As with all cloud solutions, players access a secure cloud-based plat-
form to play the game unless a nonconfidential environment is the pref-
erence. In a recent conference, Steve Ballmer reportedly cited what we
all know: that cloud is the wave of the future. He went on to report how
the gamebox Kinect’s sensors register the body motions of its users
without the need for a handheld device. He reportedly shared how
friends using Kinect can interact with each other in cloud-based cyber-
space.1 This is an example of how game mechanics can be applied to seri-
ous situations such as three-dimensional (3D) simulations of medical
emergencies and responses.
Adoption of cloud analytics is a business trend that is expected to
continue to grow. Measurements in serious gaming environments must
consider the human as well as the technological elements, such as met-
rics tracking of how well personnel are learning and engaging in gaming
exercises, and instrumentation for monitoring the performance and uti-
lization of applications and infrastructure hardware. Such instrumenta-
tion yields new insights, and the feedback needed to continuously
improve scenarios that serious gamers seek to model in training and real
life, as well as improving the quality of the playing experience. Table

Cloud Streaming
If you are familiar with video streaming technologies, you have expe-
rienced the buffer syndrome—delays that require you to patiently wait
for images to load. And you have likely experienced image display issues
on your mobile phones—where the images do not appear as they should.
Cloud streaming is a video compression service that runs in a cloud data
center. When graphics-intensive applications are made the cloud returns
results as a video stream. The technology compresses video streams so
that mobile devices are more receptive to graphics-intensive service
requests; however, the process is seamless to the end user, and as far as
they are concerned the mobile device is actually responding to service
requests.
Cloud streaming is said to be able to allow streaming movies to be
fast-forwarded and rewound in real time, while schools anywhere could
gain easy access to software.13 The technology is intended to make appli-
cations such as movie editing or architectural design tools accessible on
Internet connected devices such as smart phones and tablets. Cloud
streaming involves continuous checks of a network connection’s quality,
increasing the amount of video compression and adjusting bandwidth
requirements as needed. Some providers of cloud streaming have report-
edly negotiated with Internet carriers to ensure that data from cloud
servers are carried directly on high-speed, high-capacity Internet back-
bones. An example cloud streaming service is OnLive.14 The OnLive
service allows the game content to be passed along the Internet to end
users running OnLive clients on variety of operating systems.

Cloud Storefronts (a.k.a AppStores)
The trend that storefront providers use open source so that cloud
applications can be used on numerous platforms has emerged as a busi-
ness necessity. Consider the following: It has been reported that the
number of native iPad apps has surpassed 100,000 and represents around
25 percent of the total number of applications in the AppStore, which as
of this writing stands at more than 425,000.15 These applications are
distributed via the AppStore as third-party solutions that run on the
provider’s operating system (OS).16
Understandably, this business model presents problems for consumers
as they could become bound to a provider. As an example, we look for-
ward to shopping at the Kindle Store and being able to purchase books
that may not be available yet by Amazon but are available in digital for-
mat at other AppStores.
The same is applicable to enterprise cloud applications. Open source
standards adoption is the trend, and it should be. Providers should lever-
age open source so that consumers are not bound to a provider’s dash-
board because in many cases companies have user interface standards
that cannot be replaced simply because they are interested in cloud serv-
ices. In Chapter 5, “What About Governance?,” you learned of key con-
siderations for governing cloud service brokers; likewise in Chapter 6,
“Mitigating Risk,” you learned of key questions to ask your candidate
providers when it comes to cloud adoption. Questioning and establish-
ing policies for your potential AppStore, the variety of cloud solutions
and services that will reside in the service catalog, interoperability, and
the simplicity when it comes to using and maintaining the storefront is
essential to your success.
An associated trend is the move away from requiring downloads to devices
and instead applications are run remotely over the Internet where applica-
tions can be hosted by third-party providers in the case of brokered solutions,
or they are hosted directly by the cloud providers. As discussed in this appen-
dix, cloud enables service consumption across numerous devices and remote
storage so that you do not have to download data onto your systems, fueling
the concept of ubiquitous data centers.

Big Data
Information is growing at a staggering pace, and the increased veloc-
ity, volume, and variety of data brings challenges that cannot be met
with legacy or traditional approaches. As the amount of data continues
to grow a new term has been coined, Big Data, which refers to the large
amount of data, the format of the data, and how it is managed.
Managing and benefiting from this massive and growing amount of data
is where cloud computing plays a role.
Competing and differentiating necessitates improved decision-mak-
ing using information. Extracting insight from this enormous amount of
data is the challenge. The Big Data phenomenon started from the
Internet, as did the tools to manage it. Big Data has entered enterprises
and with it a class of analytics described as massive scale analytics
Although companies have handled large data sets before, we are now
talking Internet scale. The type of data—unstructured, human gener-
ated and/or sensor generated—creates enormous opportunities for
insights, innovation and differentiation.
The use of analytics, predictive and massive scale, fundamentally
changes what is possible, enabling you to do things you cannot do today
due to significant data volumes and associated complexities. In fact, the
ease of leveraging Big Data’s value and the magnitude of its value propo-
sition varies. However, the arrival of cloud computing allows all compa-
nies to have access to platforms for massive scale analytics that might be
CPU or I/O intensive. Companies need access to a platform that can han-
dle structured (e.g., relational databases) and unstructured (e.g., videos,
audio, blogs, etc.); and a platform that can accommodate a variety of
workloads. Scalability and elasticity for data volumes at tens to hun-
dreds of terabytes growing to pegabytes will be requirements for a plat-
form. Analytics software supported by parallel analytics for performance
will be required. Cloud computing will be the delivery model for many
organizations taking advantage of the opportunities presented by Big
Data and analytics. Adoption of cloud will allow organizations to bring
together a variety of data, at huge volumes, and in a timely manner to
generate insight. This is also where Big Data and cloud streaming merge
as multiple data streams are analyzed from many sources live.

Natural Language
The IBM and Jeopardy! contest aired February 14, 15, and 16, 2011,
on the Jeopardy! TV show between Watson and two of the most cele-
brated Jeopardy! champions of all time: Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter.
In 2004, Ken won 74 games in a row. Brad is the biggest money winner
in the history of the show. For nearly four years IBM scientists had been
working on an advanced automatic Question Answering (QA) system,
code-named “Watson.” Watson is capable of analyzing and understand-
ing rich natural language questions and answering them with enough
precision, confidence, and speed to compete with Jeopardy! champions.
Jeopardy! clues are written in rich natural language, requiring an under-
standing of subtle meaning, irony, riddles, and other complexities. The
contest demonstrated that natural language processing can be used
today.
The Jeopardy! challenge poses a different kind of problem than what is
solved by a Web search. It demands that the computer deeply analyze
the question to figure out exactly what is being asked, deeply analyze
the available content to extract precise answers, and quickly compute a
reliable answer in light of whatever supporting or refuting information
it finds. IBM believes that an effective and general solution to this chal-
lenge can help drive the broader impact of automatic question answering
in science and the enterprise. For example, such technology can be used
to diagnose disease, handle technical support, and parse and understand
vast tracts of legal documents.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the computerized approach to
analyzing text that is based on both a set of computational techniques
and a set of technologies. Its useful in that we can process huge amounts
of data (e.g., books, research papers, Internet, etc.) in a mode that
requires reasoning about questions, the answers uncovered, where a dia-
logue about the question can be held. Such a computer platform could
extend its capabilities using analytics tools to empower much broader
reasoning and higher quality responses. Cloud computing can provide
the delivery model for leveraging such technology.

Summary
You can expect business models to evolve as your CIO and senior lead-
ers explore how cloud can be most effectively used in your organization.
This appendix provided some examples including the use of serious
games to simulate business processes and cloud streaming for graphics-
intensive “real-time” compute power.
Industry verticals (as discussed in Chapter 3, “The Life Cycle of Your
Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategy”) are expected to continue to pursue
private and community clouds because this most effectively meets their
business models, but public cloud consumption will remain as well since
this is a vehicle to grow and extend market share. Regulatory require-
ments may drive specialized cloud services; for example, in the health-
care and pharmaceutical industries, there is likely to be an emergence of
cloud services that explicitly validate FDA compliance.
Numerous studies show that the adoption of cloud will continue to
increase into well beyond the year 2015 followed with a tapering of
adoption with a focus on more efficient use within the enterprise. Thus
you can expect as well a shift from cost savings as the key business driver
for cloud adoption to business capability such as advanced, complex
business analytics.
Discussed in this appendix are six cloud business trends where an
underlying theme for each is innovation and mobility:
■Mobile and cloud
■Gamification and serious games
■Cloud streaming
■AppStores
■Big Data
■Natural Language
In summary, the path forward for cloud is upward. Numerous uses for
cloud are yet to be discovered; some examples were discussed in this
appendix. In essence, the business benefits generally outweigh the busi-
ness risks when it comes to cloud adoption and when the proper due
diligence to prepare for the transition is conducted. How best might you
sharpen your skills and prepare for the future? Consider operating as a

strategic thinker, a thought leader, a visionary, and a roadmap developer
that is sharp in business consultancy, IT transformation, and enterprise
integration. On a more tactical level, learn to orchestrate cloud solutions
across providers to optimize your business processes and solve problems.
These skills will complement the automation, broad access, and self-
service characteristics of cloud enabling you to take advantage of the
capability in the appropriate manner and for the right business reasons.
