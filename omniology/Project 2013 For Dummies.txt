Author’s Acknowledgments

this, it is because the following people at For Dummies and John Wiley & Sons 
have been instrumental in getting this information to you.
I am grateful to my acquisitions editor, Kyle Looper, for giving me the oppor­

ciate his time and effort associated with keeping the schedule on track and 
helping me with the artwork (again and again!). Becky Whitney made sure

began with index cards and yarn to one that now uses sophisticated 
analyses, techniques, projections, reporting, and time and money tracking.

✓	Start out in Project 2013 by entering tasks and dependencies, estimating 
durations, and working with views
	
✓	Work with resources, calendars, and costs
	
✓	Negotiate constraints, fine-tune the schedule, and set a baseline
	
✓	Gather data, analyze progress, take corrective actions, and report 
­project status

Project 2013 For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve made some assumptions about you, gentle reader. I figure that you’re 
computer-literate and that you know how to use the mouse, the keyboard, 
software menus, and toolbars. I assume that you know how to use most 
common Windows functions (such as the Clipboard), as well as many basic 
software functions, such as selecting text and dragging and dropping items 
with the mouse.
I also assume that you have experience in managing projects. Whether you 
manage very large projects that are several years long or you have been a 
team lead on a project, the information in this book is more accessible if you 
have a background in project management.
I do not assume that you’ve used Project or any other project management 
software. If you’re new to Project, you’ll find what you need to get up to 
speed, including information on how Project works, finding your way around 
the Project interface, and building your first Project plan. If you’ve used an 
earlier version of Project, you’ll find out about Project 2013 and all the new 
features it provides.
Conventions Used in This Book
Let me explain a few odds and ends to simplify using this book:
	
✓	Some words are italicized to define them the first time I use them.
	
✓	Ribbon commands are given in the order in which you select the tab and 
command (without the group) — for example, “Choose Project➪Project 
Information.” When necessary, additional information (including the 
group) is provided, such as “Choose View➪Tables (in the Data group).”
	
✓	Options in dialog boxes use initial caps (even if they aren’t capital­
ized on your screen) to help identify them in sentences. For example, 
text that appears as Show summary tasks in the Options dialog box 
appears as Show Summary Tasks in this book.
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read this book sequentially, and you don’t even have to 
read all the sections in any particular chapter. You can skip information that 
isn’t relevant to you and read only the material that helps you complete the 
task at hand.

 Introduction
Despite this caveat, I have structured this book to advance from some basic 
concepts that equip you to understand how Project works to the steps 
involved in building a typical project. If you have an overpowering need to 
find out the whole shebang, you can start at the beginning and work your 
way through the book to build your first Project plan.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is designed to help you begin to use Microsoft Office Project 2013 
to plan, build, and track progress on projects, keeping in mind tried-and-true 
project management practices and principles. I’ve divided the book into logi­
cal parts that follow the process of building and tracking a typical project 
plan.
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013
Part I explains what Project 2013 can do for you and describes the types of 
input you have to provide to use it successfully on projects. You’ll get a first 
glimpse of Project views and discover how to navigate around them. You’ll 
begin to build a project schedule by developing a work breakdown structure 
(WBS), entering tasks, sequencing tasks, and estimating durations.
Part II: Managing Resources
Part II is the Project resources section: You discover all you need to know 
about creating and assigning work resources, material resources, and fixed 
costs to tasks in a project. You can also see how using resources on a project 
relates to the costs it accrues over time.
Part III: Before You Baseline
After you know how to map the project schedule, it’s time to see whether 
that schedule meets your budget and timing needs. Project offers a whole 
toolbox to help you modify resource assignments and task timing to trim 
costs and meet deadlines so that you can finalize the plan. You’re also 
briefed on how to modify the format of items in the project to make the plan 
look as polished as possible, both onscreen and in print. After everyone 
involved in the project has agreed to the schedule, you can baseline it and 
start to track against it.

Project 2013 For Dummies 
Part IV: Staying on Track
As any experienced project manager knows, projects rarely turn out the way 
you think they will. In this part, you begin to track actual activity against 
the plan. You also take a look at methods of reporting progress and deter­
mine how to get back on track when the plan is derailed. Project 2013 has 
revamped the reporting function to create compelling and lively reports; 
I discuss how to make the most of your reporting effort using this new func­
tionality. In the last chapter in this part, I provide advice on how to use what 
you glean from projects to make better planning choices going forward.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Ten seems to be a handy number of items for humans to organize lists, so 
this part gives you three of them: “Ten Golden Rules of Project Management,” 
“Ten Cool Shortcuts in Project 2013,” and “Ten Project Management Pitfalls 
and How to Avoid Them.” The first of these chapters tells you about some 
dos and don’ts that can save you a lot of grief when you’re using Project for 
the first time (or the fifth time, for that matter). The second chapter offers a 
look at some cool ways to make your work go faster by double-clicking, right-
clicking, or keystroking in shortcuts. The final chapter in this part discusses 
common project management pitfalls and how you can avoid them.
Icons Used in This Book
One picture is worth . . . well, you know. That’s why For Dummies books use 
icons to provide visual clues to what’s going on. Essentially, icons call your 
attention to bits of special information that may well make your life easier. 
The following icons are used in this book.
	
The Remember icon signals either a pertinent fact that relates to what you’re 
reading at the time (but is also mentioned elsewhere in the book) or a reiter-
ation of a particularly important piece of information that’s, well, worth 
repeating.
	
Tips are the advice columns of computer books: They offer sage advice, a bit 
more information about topics under discussion that may be of interest, or 
ways to do things a bit more efficiently.
	
Warning icons spell trouble with a capital T: When you see a warning, read it. 
If you’re not careful, you might do something at this point that could cause 
disaster.

elcome to the world of computerized project management with 
Microsoft Project. If you’ve never used project management software, 
you’re entering a brave new world. It’s like walking from the office of 25 years 
ago — with no fax, voice mail, or e-mail — into the office of today, with its 
wealth of high-tech devices.
Everything you used to do with handwritten to-do lists, word processors, 
and spreadsheets magically comes together in Project. However, this transi­
tion doesn’t come in a moment, and you need a basic understanding of what 
project management software can do to get you up to speed. If you’ve used 
previous versions of Project, the overview in this chapter can refresh your 
memory and ease you into a few of the new Project 2013 features.
Even if you’re a seasoned project manager, this chapter provides the founda­
tion for how to work with Project.
Introducing Project Management
You probably handle projects day in and day out. Some are obvious, because 
your boss named them so that any fool would know that they’re projects: 
Acme Drilling Project or Network Expansion IT Project, for example. Others 

10
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
are less obvious, such as that presentation you need to put together for your 
director or that how-to guide on planting a vegetable garden in your backyard.
In this book, a project is defined as a unique venture undertaken to produce 
distinct deliverables, products, or outcomes. In the context of a project, a 
deliverable is a discrete component or item that meets the requirements of 
the project, such as a design document or a prototype. Projects have mul­
tiple variables; some are straightforward to define, and others aren’t.
Using the information about variables in Table 1-1, you can say that project 
management is the practice of organizing, managing, and controlling project 
variables to meet the project outcomes and mission.
Table 1-1

Defining project manager
Although understanding the role (let alone the usefulness) of certain manag­
ers isn’t always easy, you can easily spot the value of a project manager: This 
person creates the master plan for a project and ensures that it is implemented 
successfully. Along the way, the project manager uses technical, business, 
www.allitebooks.com

11
 Chapter 1: Project Management, Project 2013, and You
and professional skills to manage the completion of tasks and keep the 
schedule on track.
	
A truly professional project manager may have a degree in project manage­
ment or a professional certification. For example, if you see the initials PMP 
beside a name, that person has been certified as a project management profes­
sional by the Project Management Institute, the leading global organization 
establishing project management standards and credentials, and offering edu­
cational and other types of resources in the field.
Identifying what a project manager does
A project manager isn’t always the highest authority in a project. Often, that 
role belongs to whoever manages the project manager — including, possibly, 
members of senior management. Rather, the project manager is the person 
who ensures that aspects of the project are integrated and assumes hands-on 
responsibility for successes as well as failures.
	
In project management parlance, the person who champions (and funds) a 
project is the project sponsor. Although the project manager may work for 
the project sponsor, the project often also has a customer — outside the proj­
ect manager’s own company or within it — for whom the end product is 
produced.
The project manager manages these essential pieces of a project:
	
✓	Scope: Define and organize all work that needs to be done in order to 
meet the project mission and create deliverables.
	
✓	Schedule: This element, which you create by working with Project, 
includes the estimated steps and associated timing involved in reaching 
the project goal.
	
✓	Resources: Assign resources and track their activities on the project as 
well as resolve resource conflicts and build consensus. This part of the 
job also involves managing nonhuman resources such as materials and 
equipment.
	
✓	Cost: Estimate project costs and apply those estimates across the sched­
ule to create a time-phased budget.
	
✓	Communication with the project team, management, and customers: 
Communicating the project’s status to its stakeholders (everyone who 
has a legitimate stake in its success) is a key responsibility.
Creating a logical balance of the defined variables of scope, time, cost, and 
resources is at the core of a good project manager’s job throughout the life of 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
a project. Managing a project requires overseeing all its variables to ensure 
that the project goals are accomplished on time, within the limits of the 
budget, and using the assigned resources while also addressing risks, manag­
ing change, and satisfying stakeholders. Sound easy? Maybe not. However, 
one thing is certain: Having software to help organize and structure the work 
makes managing the project less daunting. That’s where Project 2013 can help.
Introducing Project 2013 
Project 2013, which is a scheduling tool, helps you organize, manage, and 
control defined variables, as identified in the preceding section. The program 
indirectly helps you manage undefined variables as well. I show you how to 
use Project to organize and manage your work, create realistic schedules, 
and optimize your use of resources.
Take a moment to look at some of the wonderful ways in which Project can 
help you organize, manage, and control your project. Now that you have, or 
your company has, bought Project (and this book) and you’re investing your 
time to understand how to use it, you can enjoy these benefits:
	
✓	Use built-in templates to get a head-start on your project. Project 
templates are prebuilt plans for a typical business project, such as com­
mercial construction, an engineering project, a new product rollout, soft­
ware development, or an office move.
	
✓	Organize your project by phase, deliverable, geography, or any other 
method. The outline format allows you to progressively elaborate the 
information in greater granularity depending on how detailed you want 
your plan to be.
	
✓	Determine costs by your chosen method. Examples are time period, 
resource type, deliverable, or cost type.
	
✓	Organize resources by resource type. Level your resources to avoid 
overallocation, or determine the impact on the duration of a task based 
on a change in resources.
	
✓	Calculate costs and timing based on your input. You can quickly calcu­
late what-if scenarios to solve resource conflicts, maintain costs within 
your budget, or meet a deliverable deadline.
	
✓	Use views and reports with the click of a button. A wealth of informa­
tion is now available to you — and those you report to. You no longer 
have to manually build a report on total costs to date to meet a last-
minute request from your boss.
	
✓	Manage complex algorithms (that you couldn’t even begin to figure out 
on your own) to complete such tasks as leveling resource assignments to 
solve resource conflicts, filtering tasks by various criteria, modeling what-
if scenarios, and calculating the dollar value of work performed to date.

 Chapter 1: Project Management, Project 2013, and You
	
No matter how cool the tool, you have to take the time to enter meaningful 
data. Great software doesn’t ensure great outcomes; it only makes them easier 
to achieve.
Getting to Know You
The file you create in Project is a Project schedule. Similar to a multidimen­
sional chess game from Star Trek, it has a plethora of data about various 
aspects of your project as well as graphical representations of that informa­
tion. To help you make sense of all the information, Project provides more 
views than the Grand Canyon. These views help you observe the structure of 
your plan and see the progress in your project.
	
Some people refer to the project schedule as the project plan. In reality, the 
project plan contains the project schedule — plus information such as the 
budget, work breakdown structure, project life cycle, risk management plan, 
and many other ingredients necessary to effectively manage a project.
When you first open Project 2013, you see several options for starting a new 
project, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1: 
What you 
see when 
you open 
Project 
2013.
	

14
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
You can open a blank project, create a new project from an existing project, 
or create a new project by importing information from Microsoft Excel or 
SharePoint. You can also take advantage of premade templates for common 
project types, such as these examples:
	
✓	Commercial construction
	
✓	Software development
	
✓	New product launch
	
✓	Residential construction
If you don’t see the template you need, you can search for online templates 
by entering keywords in the search box at the top of the page. For purposes 
of this discussion, I assume that you’re starting with a new, blank project.
When you open a new project, you see the Quick Access toolbar, a few file 
tabs, the Ribbon, the Timeline, a pane with a sheet and a chart, and the 
status bar, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
Figure 1-2: 
A blank 
project.
	

15
 Chapter 1: Project Management, Project 2013, and You
In Figure 1-2, you see Gantt Chart view. (I discuss views in Chapter 6.) For 
now, here’s an overview of the major elements in Project (refer to Figure 1-2):
	
✓	Quick Access toolbar: The Quick Access toolbar, above and to the left 
of the Ribbon, is onscreen at all times and in all views.
	
✓	File tab: The file tabs organize commands based on a particular type of 
activity. For example, if you’re working with resources, you’ll likely find 
the command or setting you want on the Resource tab.
	
✓	Ribbons: Ribbons provide easy access to the most commonly used 
tools and commands. When you change tabs, the available tools on the 
Ribbon change.
	
✓	Group: A group is a set of related commands or choices on the Ribbon. 
For example, to format text in a cell on the sheet, first find the format­
ting information you need in the Font group on the Task ribbon.
	
✓	Timeline: The Timeline provides an overview of the entire project — a 
graphical view of the project from start to finish.
	
✓	Sheet: Similar to a spreadsheet, the sheet displays the data in the proj­
ect. The default fields change depending on the file tab you’re working 
in. You can customize the columns and fields in the sheet to meet your 
needs.
	
✓	Chart: The chart is a graphical depiction of the information on the sheet. 
Depending on the view or file tab you see, you might also see a bar 
chart depicting the duration of a task or a resource histogram showing 
resource usage.
	
✓	Status bar: The status bar, at the bottom of the Project window, has 
information on views, the zoom level, and newly entered tasks that are 
scheduled.
Navigating file tabs and the Ribbon
Each of the six file tabs in Project shows different options on the Ribbon. In 
this section, I provide an overview of each file tab and of the Ribbon and the 
Quick Access toolbar. As delve deeper into Project, I elaborate in later chap­
ters on various functions and commands on the Ribbon.
The first tab on the left, the File tab, stands out in bright green. After you 
click this tab, you see the menu bar down the left side, as shown in Figure 1-3.
The File tab is shown in Backstage view, where you find choices for working 
with files and changing options. For example, you can create a new project, 
open an existing project, save your current project, or print your current 

16
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
project. From Backstage view, you can also share, export, or close your 
current project. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even customize the 
Ribbon and the Quick Access toolbar.
	
Figure 1-3: 
The File tab 
menu.
	
The Task file tab is where you spend a lot of your time in Project. As you 
can see in Figure 1-4, on the far left side of the Task file tab is the View. The 
default view (refer to Figure 1-2) is Gantt Chart view. It shows the sheet for 
task information and the chart that will display a bar chart representing the 
duration of each task.
In addition to Gantt Chart, you can choose these views:
Calendar	
Network Diagram
Resource Sheet	
Resource Usage
Resource Form	
Resource Graph
Task Usage	
Task Form
Task Sheet	
Team Planner
Timeline	
Tracking Gantt

Figure 1-4: 
The Task 
file tab.
	
You may recognize some of the groups of commands on the Task file tab. 
For example, the Clipboard and Font groups are standard in Windows. Other 
groups, such as Schedule and Tasks, are specific to a particular view — in 
this case, Gantt Chart view. Look for the purple Gantt Chart Tools Format tab 
when you see the Task file tab in Gantt Chart view.
You use the Resource file tab, shown in Figure 1-5, to manage resources, 
such as adding, assigning, and leveling resources across tasks. In Project, 
resources include people, equipment, material, locations, and supplies. You 
can assign costs and calendars to resources. (I talk more about resources in 
Chapter 7.)
	
Figure 1-5: 
The 
Resource 
file tab.
	
On the Project file tab, you find commands to help you manage your project 
as a whole, rather than by task or resource. For example, you can enter or 
change the project start and finish dates, the project priority, and the base­
line. You can also use this file tab to run reports. Figure 1-6 shows the Project 
file tab.
	
Figure 1-6: 
The Project 
file tab.
	
The View file tab lets you see some standard views. Examples are Task 
views, such as Gantt Chart or Network Diagram, and Resource views, such as 
Resource Usage or Resource Graph. You can use the View file tab to look at 
information sorted by date or a specific period. You can see the View file tab 
in Figure 1-7.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
Figure 1-7: 
The View 
file tab.
	
The Format file tab has commands that help you present your schedule, such 
as font styles, page breaks, and column settings. You can see the options in 
Figure 1-8.
	
Figure 1-8: 
The Format 
file tab.
	
	
You can either pin or unpin (hide) the Ribbon to produce more real estate on 
your screen. The pushpin to the far right of the Ribbon pins it to your display, 
keeping it open and visible. The upward-facing arrow (^) on the far right side 
hides the Ribbon. You can also press Ctrl+F1 to show or hide the Ribbon.
Displaying more tools
The Quick Access toolbar, which appears onscreen at all times, initially 
contains the Save, Undo, and Redo buttons. To add buttons, click the down 
arrow at the right end of the toolbar and select the menu option to hide or 
display it. If you don’t see the command you want, select More Commands 
near the bottom of the menu to discover the other commands you can add.
The nifty Timeline tool shows the entire scaled time span of the project. You 
can add tasks or milestones to the Timeline. You can also copy the Timeline 
and paste it into reports or other presentations. To hide the Timeline, go to 
the View file tab and deselect the Timeline box. You can also work with the 
Timeline by right-clicking to insert tasks, copy the Timeline, change the font, 
or view detailed information.
The status bar sits at the bottom of the project, to indicate whether your 
tasks are manually or automatically scheduled. (Read more on this topic in 
Chapter 2.) The status bar also lets you move quickly to some of the most 
popular views, such as Gantt, Task Usage, Team Planner, Resource Sheet, 
and Reports. You can also adjust the time scale from a high-level, time scaled 
view to a detailed time-scaled view with the View slider, on the far right end 
of the status bar. I talk more about views in Chapter 6.

Chapter 1: Project Management, Project 2013, and You
Finding Help in Project
If you can get to work these days without mishap and turn on your com­
puter, you probably know how to use the Help system in a software program. 
Table 1-2 offers a rundown of the types of help you can find in Project 2013 
when you click the Help button. (Look for it above the right end of the 
Ribbon, or press F1.) As you can see, you can spend quite a bit of time simply 
working your way through all the Help topics in Project. Don’t worry about 
studying them all, though: They’ll be there when you need them.

ongratulations — you’re the proud project manager of a new project! 
Before you do anything, you need to understand the scope of the proj­
ect. You must clearly specify, for example, any intended outcomes, expecta­
tions for milestones, main deliverables, budgeted amounts, key stakeholders, 
and what denotes success.
Planning a project isn’t as easy as opening a file in Project and entering all 
the activities you have to complete. Before you can begin to plan, you need 
to understand the purpose of the project and the high-level information 
about the project, such as milestone dates and overall budget.
To complete a successful project, you need to plan well. To plan well, you 
need to understand the project’s objectives as well as its success criteria. 
Therefore, before you enter the first task into Project, you create the project 
charter (described a little later in this chapter) to initiate the project and 
develop the work breakdown structure (WBS) to organize project deliv­
erables. Then you can start organizing the project and entering tasks into 
Project.
This chapter describes how to move from imagining a concept to planning a 
project so that you know how to enter and work with tasks and how to save 
the new project.

22
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Creating the Project Charter
Having a high-level understanding of a project is critical to project success. 
The project charter is a document that formally authorizes or recognizes a 
project; it contains high-level information about the project. The project 
charter is frequently developed by the project manager, with the project 
sponsor. The charter functions as an agreement about the purpose and 
objectives of the project.
The elements of a project charter are
	
✓	Purpose
	
✓	Description
	
✓	Objectives
	
✓	High-level requirements
	
✓	Summary milestone schedule
	
✓	Summary budget
	
✓	Assigned project manager
	
Other names for the charter are project-initiating document and statement of 
work.
The high-level information in the charter provides background information 
to help you plan the project approach and organize the work logically. Using 
the information from the charter, you can start to define the project’s major 
deliverables and its life cycle — and your approach to accomplishing all the 
project work.
Throughout this book, I use a sample project to demonstrate key concepts in 
Project. The project charter for the 10K Run/Walk sample project is shown in 
Figure 2-1. Project objectives describe the intended outcome to raise $2.5 mil­
lion for youth recreation facilities in the metro area by November 1.

Introducing the Work Breakdown 
Structure (WBS)
If you have a small project, you may be able to start entering tasks into 
Project and organize them on the fly. But for any project with more than 50 
tasks, consider how to structure and organize the work before you open 
Project. One best practice is to create the work breakdown structure, or 
WBS — a hierarchically organized representation of all the project work.
	
The concept of project work includes work that’s necessary to create the prod­
uct and work that’s necessary to manage the project, such as attending meet­
ings, completing training, and creating documentation.

25
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
Generally, you approach the WBS from the top down. In other words, you 
evaluate the entire project and then break it into large chunks, and then 
break the larger chunks into smaller chunks, and so on, until you have a 
defined, discrete deliverable. That’s where the WBS stops and project tasks 
begin.
	
The breaking of WBS deliverables into smaller chunks is known as 
decomposition.
The WBS houses all deliverables for the project and product scope. It doesn’t 
include the tasks. Those are strictly for the schedule. Another way of thinking 
about the WBS is that it’s composed of nouns, whereas the schedule is com­
posed of actionable verbs. For example, the Water Stations deliverable might 
be the lowest-level deliverable you would show on the WBS. Then define 
these tasks for the schedule using the “verb-noun” naming convention:
	
1.	 Identify water companies.
	
2.	 Develop request for quote.
	
3.	 Receive quotes.
	
4.	 Select vendor.
	
5.	 Develop contract.
	
6.	 Sign contract.
	
7.	 Oversee water station setup.
Organizing the Work
Frequently, the most challenging aspect of creating a WBS is figuring out how 
to organize it. You have several options. For example, if you have multiple 
locations for a hardware deployment, you can arrange it by geography. Many 
times, software projects are managed by life-cycle phases, such as Concept, 
Requirements, Design, Build, Test, and Deploy.
Another common way to organize work is by major deliverable. The needs and 
deliverables of the project determine how best to organize work. The WBS for 
the Youth Center Run/Walk is arranged by the type of work. You can see it pre­
sented in two different ways. One way looks like an organizational chart, and 
the other way is via outline. Either way works well; however, when you start 
decomposing past two levels, the organizational chart method becomes dif­
ficult to manage. After you delve into the detail, consider moving to an outline 
format. Figure 2-2 shows an organizational chart format for the high-level WBS.

Using the high-level WBS, you can further decompose the work into outline 
format:

After outlining the organization of the work, you can start defining the tasks 
that comprise the project schedule.
Starting the Project
In Chapter 1, I discuss how to open a blank project. After you open a blank 
project, you can begin entering basic project information, such as the start or 
end date.
Entering project information
You can enter project information into Project in two ways:
	
✓	Choose the File➪Info command. In the Project Information section on 
the right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-3, you can enter the 
start, finish, current, and status dates for the project.
	
	After choosing File➪Info, you can click the Project Information down 
arrow to access advanced properties. Then enter your name, the project 
title, company name, keywords, and other information. This information 
is used in many of the automated reports that Project creates.
	
✓	Choose Project and click the Project Information icon. You see the 
Project Information dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4. It holds the same 
information as the Project Information section on the File menu.

ing the

command.
	
	
Figure 2-4: 
The Project 
Information 
dialog box.
	

29
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
This list describes the settings within the Project Information dialog box:
	
✓	Start Date and Finish Date: For a project scheduled forward from the 
start date (see the next bullet), enter only the start date. Or if you sched­
ule backward from the finish date, enter a finish date.
	
✓	Schedule From: You can choose to have tasks scheduled backward from 
the finish date or forward from the start date. Most folks move forward 
from the start date.
	
	Although you can schedule backward, use this feature only to schedule 
the work backward initially, by selecting the finish date and clicking the 
OK button. Immediately after doing so, return to this dialog box and 
revert to the (newly calculated) start date. If you don’t, you may encoun­
ter problems down the road if you eventually record progress. At that 
point, the end date will be fixed because you’ve backward-scheduled, 
and the start date will be fixed because you’ve recorded actuals, so the 
schedule will no longer be dynamic and won’t expand or contract.
	
✓	Current Date: By default, this setting matches the computer clock set­
ting. However, you can change it so that it doesn’t match the computer 
clock setting. Changing this date is useful for looking at what-if scenarios 
or for tracking progress as of a certain date in the past or any date you 
choose.
	
✓	Status Date: You typically set the current date to track the progress 
on the project. When tracking, you usually want to see the status of 
the project as of the current moment, so you can ignore this setting. 
However, if you want to track as of the end of a fiscal period or another 
time frame, change it to track the status of tasks as of any other date.
	
✓	Calendar: Select from this drop-down list the Base calendar template 
to use for the Project calendar. I list this setting first because it’s the 
only one you have to deal with when you start a new project. For now, 
assume you will use the Standard calendar. I describe calendars in 
Chapter 8.
	
✓	Priority: This field is useful if your organization has many projects and 
you create links among them. If you use a tool such as resource leveling 
(see Chapter 12 for more about this topic) to resolve conflicts, it can 
consider this project priority setting when calculating what to delay and 
what to keep on track.

Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Weighing manual scheduling 
versus automatic scheduling
One of the most valuable aspects offered by Project has traditionally been its 
ability to recalculate task schedules when you change the project start date or 
a change to one task’s schedule affects one or more dependent (linked) tasks. 
This powerful behavior saves the project manager — you — from having to 
rethink and reenter dates to rescheduled tasks throughout the project.
But flip sides to the benefits of automation always exist, and in the case of 
project scheduling, automatic scheduling can lead to unwanted schedule 
changes based on software behavior and not on human expertise.
To retain the helpful aspects of automation that make scheduling less time-
consuming while allowing project managers to retain schedule control when 
needed, Project 2013 allows user-controlled scheduling.
In user-controlled scheduling, you can select one of these scheduling modes 
for each task:
	
✓	Auto Schedule: Project calculates task schedules for you based on the 
project start date and finish date, task dependencies, calendar selec­
tions, and resource scheduling.
	
✓	Manually: Project enables you to skip entering the duration and dates, 
and specifying them later. When you enter the duration and dates, Project 
fixes the schedule for the task and doesn’t move it unless you do so manu­
ally. The manually scheduled tasks move if you reschedule the entire proj­
ect, in most cases. The Gantt bars for manually scheduled tasks also differ 
in appearance from those for automatically scheduled tasks.
The indicator for auto-scheduled and manually scheduled tasks is at the 
bottom of the Project window. Figure 2-5 shows how the tasks in Section 1.1 
are auto-scheduled, as indicated by the time bar and the arrow in the Task 
Mode column to the left of the Task Name column. The tasks in Section 1.2 are 
manually scheduled, as indicated by the pushpin in the Task Mode column.
The project file can have all manually scheduled tasks or all auto-scheduled 
tasks — or any mix of the two. By default, all tasks that you create use the 
manually scheduled mode.

You can change the task mode two ways:
	
✓	For the overall project: To change the mode for all new tasks, select the 
Task tab, click Mode in the Tasks group, and then choose Auto Schedule 
or Manually Schedule from the menu, as shown in Figure 2-6. (Or click the 
New Tasks link at the left end of the status bar at the bottom of the project.)
	
✓	Any individual task: To change the task mode of an individual new 
task or a task that you’ve previously entered into the schedule, click 
the Task tab on the Ribbon and then click either Manually Schedule or 
Auto Schedule in the Schedule group. Or, in the sheet, click the Task 
Mode cell for the task, click the drop-down arrow that appears, and click 
either Manually Scheduled or Auto Scheduled in the drop-down list.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
From there, work with information for the task as described in the rest of this 
chapter.
	
You need to balance the desires of your inner control freak versus the need to 
be an efficient project manager in determining how often to use manual sched­
uling. Though manual scheduling prevents Project from moving tasks that 
you want to stay put in the schedule, you may need to edit the schedules for 
dozens of dependent tasks in a long or complicated project. The best 
balance — particularly for beginning project managers — may be to use 
manual scheduling sparingly.
Entering the WBS
The schedule should be set up the same way as the WBS. If you want to con­
tinue the outline numbering scheme from the WBS, Project automatically 
extends to the schedule tasks the outline numbering used for the WBS. You 
can do this in two ways:
	
1.	Select the Format tab.
	
2.	In the Columns group, click Insert Column.
	
3.	Select the Outline Number option.
	
4.	Press Enter.
You can also enter the outline number directly into the task cell by following 
these steps:
	
1.	Click to open the Format tab.
	
2.	Select the Outline Number check box.
You can also have the outline number automatically entered directly into the 
task cell, this way:
	
1.	Select the Format tab.
	
2.	Check Outline Number.
The first information to enter into the new project is the WBS. Follow these 
simple steps to enter the WBS in Gantt Chart view:
	
1.	In the Task Name column, click a blank cell.
	
2.	Type the name of the WBS element.
	
	Using the example of the Youth Center 10K Run/Walk, the first element 
is Registration.

33
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
	
3.	Press the down arrow to move to the next cell in the column and then 
type the next task name.
	
4.	Repeat Step 3 until you enter all WBS names.
	
	 You can edit the text that you type by pressing the Delete or Backspace 
key to clear characters.
After you enter the WBS, you can use the Indent feature to create the outline 
format. In Project, you can indent two ways:
	
✓	Select the Task tab and click the Schedule group’s Indent Task or 
Outdent Task icons.
	
✓	Select the task you want to indent and press Alt+Shift+right arrow.
Figure 2-7 shows part of the screen display after you enter the WBS outline. 
This version shows the outline numbering as a separate column. Notice that 
after you indent a task, its parent task switches from manually scheduled to 
auto-scheduled because the duration and dependencies of the child tasks 
determine when the parent task can start and finish. Therefore, you don’t 
fill in the duration or start and finish dates for WBS elements. You enter that 
information later, when you enter tasks beneath the WBS elements. 
	
Figure 2-7: 
The WBS 
for the youth 
center’s 10K 
run/walk 
event.
	

34
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Entering tasks
After the WBS information is entered, you can start entering tasks. You can 
create tasks in a few different ways:
	
✓	Type information in the sheet area of the Gantt chart.
	
✓	Enter information in the Task Information dialog box.
	
✓	Import tasks from Outlook.
	
✓	Import tasks from Excel.
You can fill in the details of the task duration and start date at the same time 
or later.
Generating tasks in Gantt Chart view
Many people who work on lengthy projects find that entering all task names 
in the sheet pane of Gantt Chart view is the quickest and easiest method. 
This method is the same one I used to enter the WBS information. You can 
simply enter a task name in the Task Name column, press the Enter or down-
arrow key on the keyboard to move to the next blank row, enter another task, 
and so on.
	
Use the Task Mode column to change the task scheduling mode from Manually 
Schedule to Auto Schedule for any task not using the default method.
Producing tasks via the Task Information dialog box
If dialog boxes provide the kind of centralized information form that fits 
the way you like to work, consider using the Task Information dialog box to 
enter, well, task information. The series of tabs in this dialog box contain all 
information about a task.
Follow these steps to create a task via the Task Information dialog box:
	
1.	In the Task Name column, double-click a blank cell.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-8. The 
General and Advanced tabs in this dialog box contain various timing set­
tings for the task.
	
2.	In the Name field, type a task name.
	
3.	Click the OK button to save the new task.
	
	 The task name appears in Gantt Chart view in the cell you clicked in 
Step 1.

35
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
	
Figure 2-8: 
Determining 
various task 
timing 
settings.
	
	
4.	Press the down-arrow key to move to the next cell.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1–4 to add as many tasks as you like.
As you name tasks, make task names in the project both descriptive and 
unique. However, if you can’t make all names unique (for example, you have 
three tasks named Hire Staff), you can use the automatically assigned task 
number or the outline number to identify tasks; these numbers are always 
unique for each task.
	
To insert a task anywhere within the list of tasks in Project, from the Task tab, 
click a task name cell where you want the new task to appear, and click the 
Insert Task icon. The new task is inserted in the row above. You can also press 
the Insert key on the keyboard.
Importing tasks from Outlook
After you start thinking about what has to be accomplished in a project, tasks 
start resembling breeding rabbits; what might start as a series of simple to-do 
tasks in Outlook often becomes a full-fledged project. When that happens, 
you’ll be glad to know that Microsoft provides an easy-to-use import feature 
that transfers the tasks you create in Outlook to Project.
The Import Outlook Tasks feature is essentially an import map that’s preset 
to work with Outlook task fields. Follow these steps to import Outlook tasks 
into Project:
	
1.	Open the plan that you want to insert tasks into, or open a new project 
(choose File➪New, click Blank Project, and click Create).

36
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013	
2.	 Click the Task tab on the Ribbon, click the bottom part (with the
down arrow) of the Task button in the Insert group, and click Import
Outlook Tasks.	
3.	 If a Microsoft Outlook warning message appears, click Allow.		
The Import Outlook Tasks dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-9.	
Figure 2-9: 
Importing 
task infor-
mation into 
Project.		
4.	 Select the check box beside each task you want to import, or click the
Select All button to import all Outlook tasks.		
By default, Outlook stores tasks in the Tasks folder. Selecting the Folder:
Tasks check box is another way to select all tasks in Outlook.	
5.	 Click the OK button.		
The tasks are imported and then appear at the end of the list of tasks
with change highlighting applied.
When you import a task from Outlook, its name, duration, and notes (if any) 
are also imported. If a task in Outlook has no duration, and you’ve set Auto 
Schedule as the project task mode, Project creates the task with an estimated 
one-day time frame.
Inserting hyperlinks
You can insert hyperlinks in a project outline, which provides a handy way to 
quickly open another project, another file of any type, or a web page.
You can insert a hyperlink and create a task that you can use to represent 
the timing or costs of another project or subproject in the plan because the 
timing and cost information isn’t transported from the hyperlinked project. 
Hyperlinks are more often used to link to documentation for an existing task, 
such as technical documentation, assumptions, or external information.

37
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
To insert a hyperlink to another one in the project, follow these steps:
	
1.	Type the name of the new task in a blank task name cell.
	
2.	Right-click the new task name cell for which you want the hyperlinked 
task to appear.
	
3.	Choose Hyperlink.
	
	 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-10.
	
Figure 2-10: 
Choosing a 
linking 
destination.
	
	
4.	In the Text to Display box, type the text that you want to appear for 
the hyperlink.
	
	 Ensure that this text clearly states what information is being 
summarized.
	
5.	In the Link To area, click the Existing File or Web Page icon.
	
	 You can link to a document of any type or to a web page.
	
6.	In the Look In list, locate and select the file to which you want to 
insert a hyperlink.
	
7.	Click the OK button.
	
	 The link text is inserted, and a hyperlink symbol appears in the Indicator 
field. You can simply click that link symbol to open the other file.
Inserting one project into another
You can also insert tasks from one project into another. You do this by 
inserting an entire, existing project into another project. The project that’s 
inserted is a subproject. This method is useful when various project team 
members manage different phases of a larger project. The capability to 
assemble subprojects in one place allows you to create a master schedule 
from which you can view, all in one place, all the pieces of a larger, more 
complex project.

38
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
If you insert multiple subprojects, create a pool of resources that you make 
available to all subprojects for resource assignment consistency.
Follow these steps to insert another Project file into the schedule:
	
1.	In Gantt Chart view, select the task in the task list above which you 
want the other project to be inserted.
	
2.	Choose Project➪Subproject.
	
	 The Subproject command is in the Insert group. The Insert Project 
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-11.
	
Figure 2-11: 
Inserting 
a link to 
another 
project.
	
	
3.	Using the navigation pane and file list, locate the file that you want to 
insert, and click it to select it.
	
4.	If you want to link to the other file so that any updates to it are 
reflected in the copy of the project you’re inserting, make sure that 
the Link to Project check box is selected.
	
5.	Click the Insert button to insert the file.
	
	 The inserted project appears above the task you selected when you 
began the insert process.
	
The inserted project’s highest-level task appears at the level of the task you 
selected when you inserted the project, with all other tasks below it in outline 
order. If you need to, use the Outdent and Indent tools (described in the fol­
lowing section) on the Formatting toolbar to place the inserted tasks at the 
appropriate level in the project.

39
 Chapter 2: Starting the Project
Promoting and demoting: The 
outdent-and-indent shuffle
Outdenting and indenting are the functions you use to move tasks to higher 
or lower levels of detail in the WBS and the task list. In several software pro­
grams, these terms are promoting and demoting, respectively:
	
✓	Outdenting a task moves it up a level in the outline (literally shifting it 
to the left in the outline). When outdented, a task is moved to a higher 
level of detail; in other words, it’s less detailed.
	
✓	Indenting a task moves it down a level in the outline (literally indenting 
the task to the right in the outline) and puts it at a deeper level of detail. 
Whenever you indent one or more tasks, the task above becomes the 
summary task. You can read more about summary tasks in Chapter 3.
You use tools from the Schedule group on the Task tab of the Ribbon, shown 
in Figure 2-12, to outdent and indent tasks in a project outline. The Outdent 
Task tool has a left-facing arrow; the Indent Task tool has a right-facing arrow.
	
Figure 2-12: 
Outdenting 
and 
indenting.
	

40
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
To outdent or indent a task, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click a task in a columnar view to select it.
	
2.	Click the Outdent Tasks or Indent Tasks button, according to the 
action you want to take.
	
You can build the outline even faster by indenting multiple tasks at a time. 
Drag to select multiple task IDs and then indent them. You can also use the 
standard Shift+click and Ctrl+click selection methods to select multiple tasks 
in a Project outline. Shift+click the task IDs to select contiguous tasks, and 
Ctrl+click to select discrete tasks.
	
You can indent using keystrokes by pressing Alt+Shift+right arrow. You can 
outdent using keystrokes by pressing Alt+Shift+left arrow.
Saving the Project
Saving Project files works just as saving does in most other software you’ve 
used. Here’s a reminder.
To save a Project file that you haven’t yet saved, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪Save As.
	
	You can choose Save instead if you created the project from scratch 
rather than from a template.
	
2.	Use the navigation pane at the left to locate the folder where you want 
to save the file; then click to select it.
	
3.	In the File Name text box, type a name for the project.
	
4.	Click the Save button.
	
Good organizational practice suggests that you create a folder for your project 
where you save — in one spot — your Project file and its supporting docu­
ments, such as e-mail messages and other items. You can create a new folder 
from within the Save As dialog box by clicking the New Folder button.

T

he foundational unit in a project schedule is the project task; everything 
starts with it. After you identify and document your tasks, you can work 
with resources, dependencies, costs, durations, and other elements.
To be an effective task master, you need to be nimble in managing your tasks: 
Determine how to summarize work with a summary task, move work around, 
start and stop work in the middle of a task, and do all kinds of other tricks 
that help your schedule reflect what you want to happen on your project.
Creating Summary Tasks and Subtasks
When you look at a project work breakdown structure aka WBS (refer to 
Chapter 2), or a project task list, such as the one shown in Figure 3-1, you see 
that it organizes tasks into levels. The upper levels are from the WBS. The 
lower level consists of tasks that have been decomposed from the WBS. A task 
that has other tasks indented below it in this outline structure is a summary 
task, or parent task. The tasks indented below the summary task are subtasks, 
or child tasks. Summary tasks are indicated in bold in the Project outline. You 
can tell when a summary task has a family of subtasks clinging to its skirts: 
When a subtask is hidden, a little clear triangle is displayed to the left of the 
summary task. When you click the triangle with the tip of the pointer — its 
hot spot — the task expands to show its whole clan of subtasks, and the 
summary task adds a black triangle to its left.

42
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
Figure 3-1: 
Project 
outline, 
showing 
summary 
tasks and 
subtasks.
	
In Figure 3-1 you can see that the summary task (or, in this case, deliverable) 
named User Interface has hidden subtasks. The Payment summary task 
shows all its subtasks.
All information about a family of tasks is rolled up into its highest-level sum­
mary task. Therefore, any task with subtasks has no timing or cost informa­
tion of its own: It gathers its total duration and cost from the sum of its parts.
This roll-up functionality is cumulative: The lowest-level task rolls up to its 
parent, which might roll up into another summary task, which rolls up (for 
example) into a project summary task. Any task with tasks below it gets its 
duration and cost information from a roll-up of its subtasks, no matter how 
deeply nested it may be in the hierarchy.
	
The structure of families in an outline is also useful when you need to reorga­
nize an outline: When you move a summary task, all its subtasks come right 
along for the ride, regardless of whether it’s expanded!
If a summary task is manually scheduled, the roll-up functionality doesn’t work, 
and Project displays warnings telling you so. The Gantt bar for the summary 
task has a red warning bar that shows you the calculated duration of the 
subtasks when they don’t match up with the summary task’s duration. The 

43
 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
summary task’s Finish field entry also has a red, squiggly underline to indi­
cate a potential scheduling problem. To deal with this situation, you can 
change the summary task to use auto-scheduling, in which case it calculates 
roll-up data correctly. If you want the summary task to continue to be manu­
ally scheduled, you can edit its finish date or use the Task Inspector as 
described in Chapter 11 to fix the summary task schedule.
How many levels can you go?
You have no practical limit on how many levels of tasks you can create in an 
outline. Project enables you to indent to more levels of detail than you’ll need 
for all but the most complex schedules. Remember, though: At some point, 
you have to deal with assigning timing and resources to each of these tasks 
and then track their progress. Too much detail can make your project plan 
difficult to manage. For example, if your project is a few months long, you 
don’t want to track to a level where activities last only minutes or (in most 
cases) hours. Best practices suggest that you always manage to the level to 
which you want to manage — typically, business (working) days or weeks.
For longer projects, you can schedule by using rolling wave planning, a 
method of progressively elaborating the amount of detail for near-term work 
and keep at a higher level any work that’s further out. For example, if you 
have a two-year project, you may have the first three months planned out in 
detail, the next three months at a higher level, and the remainder of the proj­
ect schedule showing only milestones and key deliverables. As you progress 
through the project, you start to add more detail for six months and beyond. 
A good rule of thumb is to keep a good amount of detail 90 days out.
	
Rolling wave planning isn’t an excuse to add scope; it’s only the elaboration of 
existing scope.
The project summary task
Just as a ship has only one captain, only one task summarizes all other tasks 
in a project. I strongly suggest that you display the project summary task, 
which represents the highest (least detailed) level of information and is often 
simply the title of the project, such as New Product Rollout. When you tell 
Project to display the project summary task, every task in the project falls 
under it in the outline, as shown in Figure 3-2. You can see in the figure that 
Task 0, Youth Center 10K Run/Walk, is the project summary task. Notice that 
the bar for the project summary task on the chart is gray and that the bars 
for other summary tasks are black.

When you think about it, an upper-level headline in an outline is the sum of its 
parts: The headline reflects the overall topic for all items below it. The project 
summary task advances this concept a step further: This task rolls up all actual 
data from other tasks into one line item. Thus, the project summary task’s 
duration reflects the duration of the entire project. From a monetary angle, the 
project summary task’s total cost reflects the total costs for the entire project. 
Figures such as these can be handy to have at your fingertips — and that’s one 
value of a summary task.
	
If you’re confused about the length of your summary task, remember that the 
summary task duration is the difference between the earliest task start date 
and latest task end date. However, nonworking days aren’t counted in the 
summary task duration. The length of the summary task, therefore, equals the 
number of days of work over the course of the subtasks, not the number of 
calendar days between the start of the first task and end of the last.
Not everyone uses project summary tasks. You can simply create, at the 
highest level of your outline, tasks that represent major project deliverables 
or phases — with subphases and subtasks below them — and not create one 
task that’s higher in the order than all others. However, having a project 
summary task has certain benefits:
	
✓	You can quickly view totals for the project at a glance in the columns 
of data in Gantt Chart view and other views.

45
 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
	
✓	You can place a link to your project summary task in another project so 
that all data for one project is reflected in another. For example, if you 
create five schedules for new product launches in your company, you can 
easily create a master schedule for all company product launches by link­
ing to the project summary tasks in each of the projects. (Neat, huh?)
As you build your project, you can easily create a project summary task 
yourself (indent other tasks beneath it) or use a Project feature to generate 
one automatically at any time — even after you build all the phases of your 
project. To have Project automatically display a project summary task, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪Options.
	
	 The Project Options dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click Advanced in the list at the left to display the advanced options.
	
3.	Scroll down until you can see the section named Display Options for 
This Project.
	
4.	Select the Show Project Summary Task option.
	
5.	Click the OK button to display the upper-level task.
You also can use the Ribbon to display or hide the project summary task. In 
Gantt Chart view, click the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab. Then, in 
the Show/Hide group, click the Project Summary Task check box, as shown 
in Figure 3-3.

Moving Tasks Up, Down, and All Around
In Chapter 2, I show you how to outdent and indent tasks to create the WBS 
and the project outline. In this section, I show you additional ways to move 
tasks, collapse and expand tasks, and set up recurring tasks.
A maxim of project management says that things change: Tasks that you 
thought you could complete early can’t happen yet because money, people, 
or materials are in short supply. Or a task that you thought you couldn’t start 
until next July gets bumped up in priority when your customer changes his 
mind (again) about deliverables. Because of this changeability, when you 
enter tasks in a project outline, odds are that you’ll need to move those tasks 
around at some point.
You should understand that moving a task can change its outline level. A task 
retains its level in the outline only when you move the task to follow a task 
at the same level. (Okay, there’s an exception, which I get to in a minute.) 
Comparatively, if you move a lower-level task to a section of tasks at a higher 
level — for example, move a third-level task to a section of second-level tasks — 
the moved task takes on the level of the task preceding it. And the converse 
is true when you move a higher-level task to follow a lower-level task.
The exception I hinted at happens when you move a lower-level task to follow 
a summary task. For example, a second-level task that you move to immedi­
ately follow a summary task stays at the second level rather than taking on 
the summary task level of the task that now precedes it, because there’s only 
one summary task.
Moving tasks with the 
drag-and-drop method
If you ask me, drag-and-drop is to computing what the remote control is to 
television. It’s a quick, no-brainer method of moving stuff around in software 
that just makes life simpler. Here’s an example: The quickest way to move 
a task in an outline is to use the drag-and-drop method.
To move a task up and down with the drag-and-drop method, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display a columnar view, such as Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Select a task by clicking its task ID number.
	
	Simply click and release; don’t hold down the mouse button.

47
 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
	
3.	Click and drag the task to wherever you want it to appear in the 
outline.
	
	 A gray “T-bar” line appears, indicating the new task position.
	
4.	When the gray line is located where you want to insert the task, 
release the mouse button.
	
	 The task appears in its new location. If you want the task to be at a dif­
ferent level of the outline, you can now indent or outdent it as needed.
Moving tasks with the cut-and-paste 
(or copy-and-paste) method
Dragging and dropping works fine in most cases, but in very large projects — 
with a few hundred tasks or more, for example — this method can be like 
dragging a peanut to Tibet. It’s not the process; it’s the distance you have 
to travel.
In a larger outline, simply use the cut-and-paste method to move tasks:
	
1.	Select a task by clicking its task ID number.
	
2.	Click the Cut button in the Clipboard group on the Task tab.
	
	 The task is removed from its current location and placed on the 
Windows Clipboard.
	
3.	Scroll to display the location where you want the task to appear.
	
4.	Click the task after which you want to insert the task.
	
5.	Click the top part of the Paste button, also on the Task tab.
If you want to insert a copy of a task in a project outline, you can follow the 
preceding steps and click Copy rather than Cut.
	
If you’re cutting and copying only a single cell and not a whole task, click in 
the cell rather than click the task ID number.
You can use the standard Microsoft shortcuts Ctrl+C to copy, Ctrl+X to cut, 
and Ctrl+V to paste.

Now You See It, Now You Don’t: 
Collapsing and Expanding the 
Task Outline
Since the caveman days (or whenever the first fourth-grade teacher taught 
the first set of kids how to outline their book reports), outlines have allowed 
you to focus on different levels of detail. Outlines do this on paper by essen­
tially ordering information so that you can more easily focus on the level of 
information you need and ignore the rest.
With the invention of computer outlining, the capability to focus on only cer­
tain portions of an outline comes into its own, because you can easily open 
and close an outline to show or hide different levels of information — or entire 
sections of your outline. The black triangle symbol next to the Database sum­
mary (refer to Figure 3-3) indicates that all subtasks below it are displayed. 
The clear triangle next to the User Interface label indicates that the subtasks 
aren’t displayed.
This capability means that you can hide all but the upper level of tasks in a 
project to give your manager an overview of progress. Or you can close every 
phase of your project except the one in progress so that your team can focus 
on only those tasks in a status meeting. Or you can close most of your outline 
so that jumping to a late phase of a very large schedule involves no more 
scrollwork than a Baroque fireplace.
	
A summary task with all tasks displayed has a black triangle symbol to its left. 
A summary task with hidden subtasks sports a clear triangle to its left. All sum­
mary tasks are indicated in bold in the project outline. When a summary task 
has a black triangle symbol next to it, you can select the summary task and do 
one of these three things:
	
✓	Click the triangle symbol to hide all subtasks.
	
✓	Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and then click Hide Subtasks.
	
✓	Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Outline button in the Data 
group, and then click the level of detail you want to leave open in the 
entire outline. (For example, you can click Outline Level 1 for only the 
highest level in the outline to show the fewest details.)
When a summary task has a clear triangle symbol next to it, you can select 
the summary task and do one of three things:

49
 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
	
✓	Click the triangle to display one level of subtasks.
	
✓	Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and then click Show Subtasks.
	
✓	Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and click the level of the outline you want to reveal for the 
entire outline.
To quickly reveal all subtasks in a project, click the Show Outline button and 
then click All Subtasks.
	
To show subtasks from the keyboard, you can press Alt+Shift+* (asterisk). To 
hide subtasks, you can press Alt+Shift+- (hyphen) or Alt+Shift+– (minus sign) if 
you’re using the numeric keypad.
Showing Up Again and 
Again: Recurring Tasks
Some tasks occur repeatedly in projects. For example, attending a monthly 
project debriefing or generating a quarterly project report is considered a 
recurring task.
No one wants to create all the tasks for the monthly debriefing in a project 
that will take a year to complete. Instead, you can designate the recurrence, 
and Project automatically creates the 12 tasks for you.
Here’s how to create a recurring task:
	
1.	Click the Task tab on the Ribbon, click the bottom part of the Task 
button (with the down arrow) in the Insert group, and then click 
Recurring Task.
	
	 Figure 3-4 shows the Recurring Task Information dialog box that will 
insert a recurring task for a monthly meeting on the 11th of every 
month. The meeting is scheduled to occur every month for 12 months.
	
2.	In the Task Name box, type a name for the task.
	
3.	In the Duration box, click the spinner arrows to set a duration, or type 
a duration, such as 10d for 10 days.
	
	 Edit the abbreviation to specify a different time unit, if needed.
	
	 You can read about the abbreviations that you can use for units of 
duration — such as h for hours — in Chapter 5.

4.	 Select a recurrence pattern by selecting the Daily, Weekly, Monthly,
or Yearly option.		
The option you select provides different choices for the rest of the
recurrence pattern.	
5.	 Depending on the selections offered to you, make choices for the rest
of the pattern.		
For example, if you select the Weekly option, you must choose a Recur
Every x Week(s) On setting and then choose a day such as Friday. Or, if
you select Monthly, you must specify which day of every month the task
is to recur.	
6.	 In the Range of Recurrence area, type a date in the Start box; then
select and fill in either the End After or End By option.		
For example, you might start on January 1 and end after 12 occurrences
to create a task that occurs every month for a year.	
7.	 Click the OK button to save the recurring task.
If your settings cause a task to fall on a nonworking day (for example, if you 
choose to meet on the eighth day of every month and the eighth day is a 
Sunday in one of those months), a dialog box appears, asking you how to 
handle this situation. You can choose not to create the task, or you can let 
Project adjust the day to the next working day in that period.	
To assign resources to a recurring task, you have to assign the resources to 
the individual recurrences, not to the “summary” recurring task. If you assign 
resources to the summary recurring task, Project doesn’t calculate the hours 
of work correctly. I talk about assigning resources to tasks in Chapter 9.

 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
Setting Milestones
Milestones are signposts that mark significant events. Examples of milestones 
are the approval of a prototype (although the deliberations to make that 
decision might have taken months), the completion of a key deliverable, or 
the start or end of a project phase.
Some people include tasks such as Design Completed or Testing Completed 
at the end of each phase of their projects (incorporating the leading practice 
of using the past-tense noun-verb naming convention). They can then create 
timing relationships to the moment of completion — for example, allowing 
the production of a drug to proceed after the testing and approval is com­
plete. Such milestones also alert you and your team members to a moment of 
progress in your project that can help keep the team motivated.
New tasks are created with an estimated duration of one day unless you enter 
a duration. To create a milestone, you indicate that the task has zero dura­
tion. The quickest way to do it is to simply type 0 in the Duration column in 
Gantt Chart view. Or you can click the Advanced tab in the Task Information 
dialog box (see Figure 3-5) and select the Mark Task As Milestone check box. 
When you do, the milestone is designated in Gantt Chart view with a diamond 
shape rather than a task bar. Use this latter method for any milestone that 
has a duration other than zero but that you want to mark as a milestone 
anyway; its milestone marker is charted at the end of the duration period on 
the Gantt chart.

task as a

Deleting Tasks and Using Inactive Tasks
If your style is to delve into a lot of planning detail for everything you do, 
you may tend to overanalyze and add more tasks than you need to track in 
a project plan. In such cases, when you’re refining the project plan, you may 
decide that you need to delete a task or two to tighten up the plan. After all, 
the process of planning includes not only decomposing the work, but also 
consolidating tasks when they become too detailed. To delete a task, click its 
row (Task ID) number at the left side of the sheet and press the Delete key.
	
Project doesn’t display a warning or ask you to confirm deleting a task, so 
make sure that you really mean it when you press Delete. If you screw up, 
press Ctrl+Z immediately to restore the deleted task. Also, be sure to check 
that any task dependencies (links) adjust as needed after you delete the task.
Another approach is to mark a task as inactive. Doing this leaves the task 
visible in the plan but strikes it out in the task sheet and on the Gantt chart, 
as shown in Figure 3-6. If any automatically scheduled tasks were dependent 
on the inactive task, Project ignores the now-inactive task when calculating 
the schedules for those other tasks. Leaving an inactive task in the schedule 
provides another opportunity to track and document what happened. For 
example, you can add a note explaining why the task was removed, such as 
not having a budget that’s sufficient for television advertising.
	
Figure 3-6: 
An inactive 
task.
	

53
 Chapter 3: Becoming a Task Master
Follow these steps to mark a task as inactive:
	
1.	In Gantt Chart view, select the task to make inactive.
	
2.	Click the Inactivate button in the Schedule group on the Task tab of 
the Ribbon.
	
	 Project immediately reformats the task as inactive.
Making a Task Note
Despite the wealth of information that you can enter about a task and its 
timing, not everything can be said with settings. That’s why every task 
includes an area to enter notes. You may use this feature, for example, 
to enter background information about constraints, detail a step-by-step 
process that’s summarized by the task duration, change the timing, or list 
vendor contact information that’s relevant to the task.
To enter task notes, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click a task.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click to select the Notes tab, as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
3.	In the Notes area, type any information you like.
	
	 You can enter contact information, notes about resources, or other 
useful information about the task.

	Click the buttons at the top of the Notes area to change the font. You 
can also
 
• Left-align, center, or right-align text.
 
• Format text as a bulleted list.
 
• Insert an object.

I

magine this: If you create a hundred tasks and leave their default constraints 
so that they start as soon as possible and have no dependencies, all those 
tasks start on the project start date and occur simultaneously. The project 
consisting of a hundred tasks takes exactly as long to complete as the longest 
task.
Wander back over here to reality for a moment. When was the last time every 
task in your project could be performed at the same time? When did you last 
have enough resources to even begin to make that feat feasible? When did 
you ever have a set of tasks in which not a single task had to be completed 
before another one could start? Imagine what would happen if you poured a 
building’s foundation before the building permit was approved. Or consider 
the chaos that would result if you tried to train your employees to use a new 
piece of equipment before the equipment even arrived.
The reality is that not all tasks in a project start at the same time. To reflect 
this reality in a Project plan, you have to build in a timing logic. This logic 
consists of setting dependency links between tasks. Dependencies are timing 
relationships between tasks — for example, when one task depends on the 
completion of another. Dependencies are caused by one of these factors:
	
✓	The nature of the tasks: You can’t frame a house, for example, until its 
concrete foundation is dry; otherwise, the building will sink. This concept 
is sometimes referred to as hard logic.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
✓	A best practice or preference: Document all requirements before you 
start designing, however. You can start some of the high-level design 
work before documenting every requirement; it just isn’t a good practice 
to do so. This concept is sometimes referred to as soft logic.
	
✓	Resource availability: When your operations manager can’t attend two 
plant inspections simultaneously, the situation is known as a resource 
dependency.
	
✓	Reliance on a resource or an action outside the project: You need a 
deliverable from another project before you can start your work, or 
you’re waiting on someone from an external agency to sign off on it. 
Another term for this concept is external dependency.
How Tasks Become Dependent
In Chapter 1, I talk about manually scheduled tasks versus auto-scheduled 
tasks. If you allow the auto-scheduling and your network logic (dependen­
cies) to build in timing logic rather than manually assign specific dates to 
tasks, Project can reflect changes to your schedule and adjust the dates and 
timing automatically.
For example, if the task of receiving materials in-house is delayed by a week, 
the dependent task of starting the manufacturing process moves out a week 
automatically. You can note the change when you’re tracking activity in 
your plan, and Project makes adjustments accordingly. The alternative is to 
change the start date of just about every task in your schedule every time a 
task is running late; you don’t even want to think about doing that!
Dependent tasks: Which comes first?
As with human relationships, every dependency relationship involves roles: 
Each task is either a predecessor or a successor. Any two tasks with a timing 
relationship can be a predecessor-successor pair, even if the timing of the 
two tasks overlaps or they’re set to happen concurrently. Remember that 
the predecessor task’s schedule has an impact on when the successor task is 
scheduled, particularly under the auto-scheduling method.
Figure 4-1 shows you how the task bars in Gantt Chart view graphically depict 
the predecessors and successors in dependency relationships between tasks. 
Notice how task bars represent the relationship when a task starts after 
another task. Also notice the lines drawn between tasks: These lines indicate 
dependency links.

57
 Chapter 4: The Codependent Nature of Tasks
	
Figure 4-1: 
Dependency 
relationships.
	
	
Here’s some important advice about dependencies: You can have more than 
one dependency link to a task, but don’t overdo it. Many people who are new 
to Project make the mistake of building every logical timing relationship that 
can exist. If the situation changes and the dependencies have to be deleted or 
changed (for example, to shorten a schedule), the web of dependencies starts 
to get convoluted — and can easily create a nightmare.
For example, you must complete the tasks of obtaining a permit and pouring 
a foundation for a building before you can start framing it. However, if you set 
up a dependency between obtaining the permit and pouring the foundation, 
setting a dependency from foundation to framing is sufficient to establish the 
correct timing. Because you can’t start pouring the foundation until you have 
a permit, and you can’t frame until you pour the foundation, framing can’t 
start before you have a permit. This common mistake is known as having a 
redundant predecessor.
	
You don’t have to use dependencies to prevent resources from working on 
two tasks simultaneously. When you set the availability of resources and 
assign them to two tasks happening at the same time, you can use tools 
such as Team Planner view (see Chapter 9) and resource leveling (discussed 
in Chapter 12) rather than establish a dependency that forces one task to 
happen after another. This feature delays tasks whose scheduling causes a 
resource over allocation. See Chapters 9 and 12 for more about how resource 
assignments affect task timing.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Dependency types
You can establish four types of dependency links: finish-to-start, start-to-
start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish. Using these types efficiently can 
mean the difference between a project that finishes on time and one that’s 
still limping along long after you retire.
Here’s how the four dependency types work:
	
✓	Finish-to-start: This most common type of dependency link accounts for 
more than 90 percent of the dependencies you create. In this relationship, 
the predecessor task must be completed before the successor task can 
start. When you create a dependency, the default setting is finish-to-start.
	
	An example of a finish-to-start dependency is when you must complete the 
Develop Database task before you can begin the Test Database task. All 
the dependencies shown in Figure 4-1 are finish-to-start. The relationship 
is indicated by a successor task bar that starts where the predecessor 
task bar leaves off. You see the finish-to-start type abbreviated as FS.
	
✓	Start-to-start: The start of one task is dependent on the start of another. 
In this dependency type, two tasks can start simultaneously, or one task 
might have to start before another task can start. For example, assuming 
that you have the resources, you can start collecting requirements for 
payment and confirmation at the same time. A start-to-start relationship 
is abbreviated as SS.
	
	Figure 4-2 shows, accordingly, the start-to-start relationship between the 
Collect Payment Requirements and Collect Confirmation Requirements 
tasks.
	
Figure 4-2: 
The start-
to-start 
relationship.
	

59
 Chapter 4: The Codependent Nature of Tasks
	
✓	Finish-to-finish: In a finish-to-finish relationship, one task (you guessed 
it) must finish before or at the same time as another task.
	
	Suppose that you’re developing copy for print advertising. You know that 
the copy will require several rounds of writing and editing. Rather than 
show a Write➪Edit➪Write➪Edit➪Write➪Edit set of tasks, you can show 
Write and Edit in a finish-to-finish relationship in which editing finishes at 
the same time as, or after, writing is done. Figure 4-3 shows a finish-to-
finish relationship between Write Copy and Edit Copy. Finish-to-finish is 
abbreviated as FF.
	
✓	Start-to-finish: In a start-to-finish dependency, the predecessor task 
can finish only after the successor task has started. If the successor is 
delayed, the predecessor task can’t finish. Of course, this type of rela­
tionship is abbreviated as SF.
	
	Suppose that you’re bringing online a new accounting application. The 
predecessor task of Turn-Off Old Application can’t be completed before 
the successor task of Start Up New Application has started. You need 
to make sure the new application works as expected, even though you 
have tested it — run both for a month or so. Therefore, the demise of 
the old application is dependent on when the new application starts up.
	
Figure 4-3: 
The finish-
to-finish 
relationship.
	

60
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
The start-to-finish dependency type is tricky. Leave this type of logic to the 
professional schedulers and try to find a different way to indicate the relation­
ship between tasks. Often, simply breaking down the tasks and resequencing 
them accomplishes the same goal.
Allowing for Murphy’s Law: 
Lag and lead time
Dependencies can become a little more complex than simply applying the 
four types of dependency links that I describe in the preceding section. You 
can use lag time or lead time to fine-tune your timing relationships:
	
✓	Lag time occurs when you add time to the start or finish of a predecessor 
task; lag time causes a gap in timing, which delays the start of the succes­
sor task. For example, a period almost always exists between sending 
out a Request for Quote for a service and receiving the quotes. Figure 4-4 
shows the lag time that’s scheduled between the Send Out RFQ and 
Review Quotes tasks. When you show a lag, you show the plus (+) sign 
and then the amount of lag. For example, a lag of one week is shown 
as +1wk (wk is the abbreviation for week). Therefore, the relationship 
between Send Out RFQ and Review Quotes is FS+1wk.
	
Figure 4-4: 
Lag time 
between 
tasks.
	

61
 Chapter 4: The Codependent Nature of Tasks
	
✓	Lead time is created when you accelerate time between the start or 
finish of the predecessor; lead time causes an overlap between two tasks. 
This concept is sometimes referred to as fast tracking. Suppose that you 
want to accelerate the timing for the volunteer onboarding process. 
Rather than wait for all the volunteers to sign up and complete their 
paperwork, you decide to start assigning key roles and begin training 
some volunteers early. The Complete Paperwork task and the Assign 
Roles task have a finish-to-start relationship. However, to accelerate the 
process, you insert a lead of one week. A lead is considered a negative 
lag, so this relationship is shown as FS-1wk. (See Figure 4-5.)
	
Figure 4-5: 
Lead time 
between 
tasks.
	
Making the Dependency Connection
Making dependency relationships is simple: You create a dependency, select 
the dependency type, and build in any lag time or lead time. The tricky part 
lies in understanding how each type of dependency affects your plan when 
your project goes live and you start to record actual activity that resources 
perform on tasks.
Adding the dependency link
When you create a dependency, it’s a finish-to-start relationship by default: 
One task must finish before another can start. If that’s just the kind of depen­
dency you want, that’s all there is to it. If it isn’t the kind you want, after you 
create this link, you can edit it to change the dependency type or to build in 
lag or lead time. Therefore, if you’re not careful in how you select the tasks, 
the dependency arrow will go backward in the schedule.

62
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
To establish a simple finish-to-start link, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view and ensure that the two tasks you want to 
link are visible.
	
	 You may have to collapse some tasks in your project or use the Zoom 
button on the View tab to fit more tasks on the screen.
	
2.	Click the predecessor task and Ctrl+click the successor task, and when 
both tasks are highlighted, click the Chain Link icon on the Task 
file tab.
	
	 You can continue holding down the Ctrl key and highlighting as many 
tasks as you want to link.
You can link multiple tasks in a row in a finish-to-start relationship by click­
ing the first task and dragging to the last task. When you release the mouse 
button, click the Chain Link icon to link all the tasks in order.
	
Best practice is to link only subtasks, which represent the actual work per­
formed, not the summary tasks. The Ctrl+click method is helpful for skipping 
over summary tasks when selecting tasks for linking. Also, whether you use 
the mouse or the Link Tasks button to drag between tasks, the task that’s 
selected first always becomes the predecessor. Therefore, if you’re not care­
ful in how you select the tasks, the dependency arrow moves backward in the 
schedule.
To establish a link in the Task Information dialog box or to modify an existing 
relationship, make note of the task ID number of the predecessor task and 
then follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click the successor task.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box opens for the selected task.
	
2.	Click the Predecessors tab, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
	 On this tab, you can build as many dependency relationships as you like.
	
3.	In the ID field, type a task ID number for the predecessor task.
	
	Alternatively, you can select the task from the Task Name drop-down 
list. All the tasks you’ve already entered into the project appear. To 
display this list, click the next blank Task Name cell and then click the 
drop-down list arrow that appears.

To unlink, press Ctrl+Shift+F2.
Another way to enter dependencies is to expand the Task Sheet pane until 
you see the Predecessors column. You can enter the task number of the pre­
decessor task directly into that column, as shown in Figures 4-4 and 4-5.

Extending your reach with 
external dependencies
No person is an island — and no project exists in isolation. Many times, 
another project you’re managing or another project going on somewhere else 
in your organization affects your project. Perhaps resources or facilities are 
shared, or perhaps the timing of tasks in other projects affects the timing of 
tasks in yours. For example, if your project is to plan the opening of a new 
store, you may have to create a dependency from your Begin Move-In task to 
the Final Building Inspection Complete task in someone else’s construction 
project.
To deal with this balancing act, you can create a linked task that represents 
the timing of the other project (or of a particular task in it). This is also called 
creating a cross-project link. Make sure that both the file with the predecessor 
task and the file with the successor task are open. Identify the filename and 
task ID (row) number for the predecessor task. Then switch to the file with 
the successor task and open the Task Information dialog box for the succes­
sor task, as just described. Click in the ID column on a blank row. Type the 
predecessor filename, a backslash, and then the predecessor task ID number, 
as in Youth Center\4. Then press Tab to complete the entry. The linked 
task from the other file appears in the list, as shown in Figure 4-7. In the Gantt 
chart, that external successor appears in gray so you know that it doesn’t 
really “live” in the current schedule file.
	
You can also insert an entire project and add a link to it so that updates to the 
other file are reflected in your plan automatically.

Chapter 4: The Codependent Nature of Tasks
Words to the wise
I can’t stress enough how important it is to understand the nature of your 
dependencies. Assuming that you have identified the work correctly — the 
way tasks are linked, coupled with your duration estimates (described in 
Chapter 5) — is the key driver to determining an accurate schedule for your 
project. If you don’t enter the correct relationship between tasks, or if you 
leave out a linkage, your schedule will be incorrect.
When all your tasks are logically linked, the result is a network diagram, or 
precedence diagram — a visual display of how all the tasks relate to one 
another. This diagram shows the flow of work through the project. If you’re 
missing a relationship or dependency, the flow isn’t right, and you’re likely to 
be late or to have to scurry to try to make up for your oversight.	
Every task except the first and last tasks has a predecessor and a successor. If 
one of these elements is missing, the hanger task is left dangling. If a task has 
no predecessor, connect the task to the start milestone of the project. If the 
task has no successor, connect the task to the end of the phase or the finish 
milestone of the project.
In addition to making sure you understand the predecessor and successors 
of each task, you should make sure that the type of relationship is correct. If 
you try to save time by overlapping tasks, you should understand whether 
a FS relationship with a lead is a better option than a FF or SS with a lag. To 
help you determine the better option, ask yourself these questions:	
✓	If the start of the predecessor is delayed, will it cause the successor to 
be delayed?	
✓	If the finish of the predecessor is delayed, will it cause the successor to 
be delayed?
The answer to these questions will help you understand how the predecessor 
task affects the scheduling of the successor task.
Understanding that things change: 
Deleting dependencies
Just like the latest trend in fashion, dependencies in a project can suddenly 
change. For example, sometimes they’re no longer needed because of a shift 
in priorities or overall project timing. When you need to get rid of a depen­
dency, you can undo what you did in either the Gantt Chart or the Task 
Information dialog box.

66
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
Leading practices in project management suggest that dependencies should 
not be built based on resource availability. Rather, you should concern your­
self with the logical order of the work regardless of who does it at this point in 
creating your schedule. Resource leveling, or the smoothing out of the peaks 
and valleys of resource usage, is always a factor in scheduling, of course, but 
it is a factor that will be addressed in later steps in project planning.
With Gantt Chart view displayed, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the two tasks whose dependency you want to delete.
 
• For two adjacent tasks: Drag to select their ID numbers.
 
• For nonadjacent tasks: Click one task, press and hold Ctrl, and then 
click a nonadjacent task.
	
2.	Click the Unlink Tasks button in the Tasks group on the Task tab.
	
Use the above method carefully. If you click only one task and then click the 
Unlink Tasks button, the result is somewhat drastic: All dependency relation­
ships for that task are removed.
To remove dependency relationships in the Task Information dialog box, 
here’s the drill:
	
1.	Double-click a successor task name.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Predecessors tab to display it.
	
3.	Click the Type box for the dependency you want to delete.
	
	 A list of dependency types appears, as shown in Figure 4-8.
	
4.	Choose None.
	
5.	Click the OK button to save the change.
	
	 The dependency line on the Gantt chart is gone. The next time you open 
that Task Information dialog box, the dependency is gone, too.

or deleting a dependency now have either their start or finish date columns 
highlighted in the sheet pane, depending on which date the change affected.

O

ne of the most challenging aspects of managing a project is estimat­
ing how long a task will take to complete. Your team members usually 
make a good guess on task duration and hope for the best. But the estimate 
is where the concept of “garbage in, garbage out” (or, scarier, “garbage in, 
gospel out”) truly applies. After all, the duration of individual tasks combined 
with network logic and the applied calendars determines the overall duration 
of the project — at least on paper.
An accurate estimate accommodates the nature of the task and employs the 
most applicable technique for estimating. Sometimes you estimate the effort 
involved, and sometimes you estimate the duration (the number of business 
days); it all depends on the nature of the task and the level of accuracy you 
need.
An accurate estimate isn’t the only aspect of making a schedule realistic. 
Project helps your schedule reflect reality by allowing you to enter constraints, 
pause tasks, and split tasks.
	
The schedule you build in Project is a model. It reflects what you think will 
happen — or what you plan for — given the information you enter. The more 
realistic the information you enter, the more realistic your schedule. However, 
ultimately, the schedule is a tool to help you and your team; it isn’t reality. Do 
the best you can to acquire accurate data, but don’t forget that you manage 
the schedule; it doesn’t manage you.

70
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
You’re in It for the Duration
In projects, as in life, timing is everything. Timing in your projects starts with 
the durations that you assign to tasks. Although Project helps you see the 
effect of the timing of your tasks on the overall length of your plan, it can’t 
tell you how much time each task will take. That’s up to you.
Estimating the duration of tasks isn’t always easy. Your estimate has to be 
based on your experience with similar tasks and your knowledge of the spe­
cifics of your project.
	
If your projects often share similar tasks, consider saving a copy of your 
schedule as a template that you can use in the future, thereby saving yourself 
the effort of reestimating durations every time you start a similar project. Find 
out about saving templates in Chapter 19.
Tasks come in all flavors: 
Identifying task types
Before you begin to enter task durations, be aware of task types in Project; 
they have an effect on how Project schedules the work of a task using the 
automatic scheduling mode after you begin assigning resources.
Essentially, your choice of task type determines which element of the task 
remains constant (doesn’t vary) when you make changes to the task:
	
✓	Fixed Units: When you assign resources (Project considers them fixed 
units) to a task, they continue to work on that task even if the duration 
changes. (This type is the default.) For example, if you assign someone 
full time to build a presentation for senior management and you set 
the duration for three days, and then you realize that five days is more 
realistic, the number of units stays the same. In other words, the same 
person is still working on the task full time, but for five days rather than 
three days.
	
✓	Fixed Duration: The task takes a set amount of time to complete, no 
matter how many resources you add to the mix. For example, a test on a 
substance that requires leaving the test running for 24 hours has a fixed 
duration, even if you add 20 scientists to oversee the test.

71
Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time	
✓	Fixed Work: The number of resource hours assigned to the task deter­
mines its length. If you set the duration of a Fixed Work task at 40 hours, 
for example, and you assign two resources to work 20 hours each 
(simultaneously) at units of 100 percent, the task will be completed 
in 20 hours. If you remove one resource, the single resource must 
spend 40 hours at units of 100 percent to complete the task.
You can see how understanding the various task types (along with how each 
one causes the task timing or resource assignments to fluctuate) is an impor­
tant part of creating an efficient project.
Follow these steps to set the task type:	
1.	 Double-click a task.		
The Task Information dialog box appears.	
2.	 Click the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 5-1.	
Figure 5-1: 
Setting the 
task type.		
3.	 Choose one of the three options from the Task Type list.	
4.	 Click the OK button.	
You can also display the Type column on a Gantt Chart sheet and set the task 
type there.

A task type example
Because the task type is a complex concept, the example in this sidebar starts with a fixed-unit task 
that has a duration of 80 hours and two people assigned to the task full time for five days.
Change
Impact
Remove a resource.
The duration is recalculated to ten days. The work stays the same 
at 80 hours.
Increase the duration.
The work increases to be consistent with the new duration. If you 
increase the duration from five days to seven days, you add 32 
hours of work (two units x two 8-hour days).
Increase the work.
The duration increases to accommodate the extra work. If the 
work changes from 80 hours to 96 hours, for example, the duration 
increases from five days to six.
Assume that the task type for the same task is Fixed Work. Thus, the work is set at 80 hours — no 
more, no less.
Change
Impact
Remove a resource.
The duration is recalculated to take ten days. The work stays the 
same at 80 hours.
Increase the duration.
The units increase to be consistent with the new duration. If you 
increase the duration from five days to seven, your resources are 
now only allocated. When Project divides the 80 hours by seven 
days, the result is 11.43 hours of work per day. You have two 
resources, so each resource works 5.7 hours per day.
Increase the work.
The duration increases to account for the extra work. If the work 
changes from 80 hours to 96 hours, the duration increases from 
five days to six.
Finally, assume that the same task has a fixed duration: The work must be done in five days.
Change
Impact
Remove a resource.
The remaining resource is overallocated by 100 percent. In other 
words, to complete the task, the person would have to work 16 
hours per day (which is unlikely, of course).
Increase the duration.
The work increases to be consistent with the new duration. If you 
increase the duration from five days to seven, you add 32 hours of 
work (two units x two 8-hour days).
Increase the work.
The resources are either overallocated or you need to acquire an 
additional resource. If you have five days to accomplish 80 hours 
of work and you increase the work to 96 hours, your resources 
are 20 percent overallocated (96/80 = 1.2).

73
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
Effort-driven tasks: 1 + 1 = 1⁄2
When you hear the word effort in Project, think work. For a task that’s auto­
matically scheduled, you can also set it up to be effort driven: If you adjust 
resource assignments, the duration might change, but the number of hours of 
effort (work) resources needed to complete the task stays the same. (Effort-
driven scheduling isn’t available for manually scheduled tasks.) When you add 
or delete a resource assignment on an effort-driven task, work is distributed 
equally among resources. (Refer to the description of fixed-work tasks in the 
preceding section.) In fact, all fixed-work tasks are effort driven. The more 
people you add, or the more hours they work, the shorter the duration, and 
vice versa.
Suppose that you need to set up a computer network in a new office in two 
days. You assign to this task one resource who works 8 hours per day, so the 
work will take 16 hours to complete (two 8-hour days). If you then assign a 
second resource, this effort-driven task no longer takes two days, because 
the hours of effort required will be completed more quickly by the two 
people working simultaneously — in this case, in one 8-hour period.
Behind the scenes, effort-driven scheduling uses this formula to work this 
“magic”:
Duration = Work ÷ Units
After you make the first assignment, any time you add or remove more units 
(people), Project recalculates the duration accordingly.
Adding resources doesn’t cause a task to be completed sooner — in fact, the 
behavior changes from fixed work to fixed duration. Select the Effort Driven 
check box on the Advanced tab in the Task Information dialog box to enable or 
disable the Effort Driven setting; it isn’t selected by default (refer to Figure 5-1). 
When you clear this check box, the same task that you set to run two days 
takes two days, no matter how much effort your resources contribute.
	
Table 5-1 describes limiting behaviors in working with Project on effort-driven 
tasks.

Estimating Effort and Duration
Developing accurate estimates — whether for resources, durations, or 
costs — is one of the most challenging and contentious parts of managing a 
project. You should understand the nature of estimating and the difference 
between the effort needed to accomplish the work and the duration, which 
indicates the number of required work periods (activity duration). Several 
techniques are available to help you develop estimates, depending on the 
nature of the work. You can start by looking at the difference between effort 
and duration and then at the skills you need to develop accurate estimates.
Effort is number of labor units required to complete a task. Effort is usually 
expressed as staff hours, staff days, or staff weeks.
Duration is the total number of work periods (not including holidays or 
other nonworking periods) required to complete a task. Duration is usually 
expressed as workdays or workweeks.
Estimating techniques
Sometimes, people seem to estimate durations by snatching them out of 
the air or consulting a Magic 8 Ball. Estimating is undoubtedly an art and a 

75
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
science. The art stems from the expert judgment that team members and 
estimators bring to the process. Their experience and wisdom from past 
projects are invaluable in developing estimates, determining the best esti­
mating method, and evaluating estimates (or the assumptions behind them) 
to assess their validity. In addition to the artful contribution of experts, team 
members, and estimators, a number of methods comprise the science of 
estimating.
Analogous estimating
Analogous estimating is the most common method of estimating. The afore­
mentioned experts normally conduct this form of estimating. In its most 
basic form, this method compares past projects with the current project, 
determines their areas of similarity and areas of difference, and then develops 
an estimate accordingly.
A more robust application determines the duration drivers and analyzes the 
relationship between past similar projects with the current project. Duration 
drivers can include size, complexity, risk, number of resources, weight, or 
whatever other aspects of the project influence duration.
	
If you want to use analogous estimating effectively, your projects must be 
similar in fact, not simply similar in appearance. A software upgrade may 
sound similar to someone who is not familiar with software, but there are vast 
differences in what a software upgrade entails, so one software upgrade is not 
necessarily similar to others. The difference between moving from Office 2010 
to Office 2013, for example, is much different from moving from Office 2010 to 
Lotus Notes; the conversion time is different!
Parametric estimating
Parametric estimating uses a mathematical model to determine project dura­
tion. Though not all work can be estimated using this method, it’s quick and 
simple: Multiply the quantity of work by the number of hours required to 
accomplish it. For example, if a painter can paint 100 square feet per hour 
and you have 6,000 square feet to paint, you can assume 60 hours of effort. 
If three people are painting (60 ÷ 3), the task should take 20 hours, or the 
equivalent of 2.5 days.
Three-point estimating
When a lot of uncertainty, risk, or unknown factors surround an activity or 
a work package, you can use three-point estimating to produce a range and 
an expected duration. In this method, you collect three estimates based on 
these types of scenarios:

76
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
✓	Best case: In this optimistic (represented by the letter O) scenario, all 
required resources are available, nothing goes wrong, and everything 
works correctly the first time. You might see this type represented 
instead as to (for time optimistic).
	
✓	Most likely: The realities of project life are factored into the estimate, 
such as the extended unavailability of a resource, a work interruption, 
or an error that causes a delay. The most-likely (or M) scenario can also 
be represented by tm (time most likely).
	
✓	Worst case: This pessimistic (P) estimate assumes unskilled resources, 
or insufficient resources, a great deal of rework, and delays. It’s repre­
sented by tp (for time pessimistic).
The simplest way to develop the expected duration, or te (time expected) is 
to sum the three estimates and divide by 3. However, this technique isn’t the 
most accurate one because it assumes — unrealistically — an equal probabil­
ity that the best-case, most-likely, and worst-case scenarios would occur. In 
reality, the most-likely estimate has a greater chance of occurring than either 
the best-case or worst-case scenarios. Therefore, weight the most-likely sce­
nario and determine the weighted average.
The most common way to calculate the weighted average is
te = (to + 4tm + tp) / 6
Setting the task duration
Most tasks in a project (except milestones) have a duration, whether it’s ten 
minutes or a year or another span of time. The needs of your project and the 
degree of control you require determine how finely you break down your 
tasks.
	
If your project is to launch a satellite, for example, tracking the task duration 
by minutes on launch day makes sense. In most other circumstances, tracking 
the duration by days (or weeks, sometimes) is sufficient.
As with all task information, you can enter the duration in a Gantt Chart sheet 
or in the Task Information dialog box. Follow these steps to enter the duration 
in the dialog box:
	
1.	Double-click a task to display the Task Information dialog box.
	
2.	If necessary, click the General tab to display it.

77
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
	
3.	In the Duration box, use the spinner arrows to increase or decrease 
the duration, as shown in Figure 5-2.
	
4.	If the current duration units aren’t appropriate (for example, days 
when you want hours), type a new duration in the Duration box.
	
	 A new task is created with an estimated duration of one day unless you 
change the duration. You can use these abbreviations for various time 
units:
 
• m: Minute
 
• h: Hour
 
• d: Day
 
• wk: Week
 
• mo: Month
	
Figure 5-2: 
Setting the 
duration.
	
	
	 Don’t assume that changing the start and finish dates of a task changes 
its duration; it doesn’t. You have to manually change the duration. If you 
don’t, your project plan won’t be what you intended.
	
5.	Click the OK button to accept the duration setting.
	
If you’re unsure about the timing of a particular task, select the Estimated 
check box (on the General tab) when you enter the duration. This strategy 
alerts people to your lack of certainty. You can always go back and uncheck 
the box when you have better information.

78
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Controlling Timing with Constraints
In Project, constraints are timing conditions that control an automatically 
scheduled task. You tell Project which (if any) constraints are required for 
each task. Because manually scheduled tasks must follow the start and finish 
dates you specify for them, they already have de facto constraints.
Understanding how constraints work
When you create a task and set it to be automatically scheduled, the As Soon 
As Possible constraint is selected by default. In other words, the task starts 
as soon as the project starts, assuming that no dependencies with other 
tasks exist that would delay it.
A task’s start and finish dates, task dependencies, task type, Effort Driven 
setting, and constraints all work together to set the timing of each task. 
However, when Project performs calculations to save you time in a project 
that’s running late, constraint settings are considered sacred (untouchable). 
For example, if you set a constraint that a task must finish on a certain date, 
Project shifts almost any other scheduled task to recalculate the timing 
before suggesting that the task might finish on another date.
	
The excessive use of constraints limits your scheduling flexibility. Use con­
straints only when you absolutely need to force a task’s timing.
Table 5-2 describes the effects of constraints on a task’s timing.
Table 5-2	
Task Constraints

What Happens When You Apply It
As Soon As Possible
The task starts as early in the schedule as possible based 
on dependencies and the project start date. (It’s the 
default setting.)
As Late As Possible
The task occurs as late as possible in the schedule, based 
on dependencies and the project’s finish date.

The end of the task can occur no earlier than the date you 
specify.

79
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
Establishing constraints
To set a constraint, you select the type of constraint you want in the Task 
Information dialog box. Though you can set only one constraint for a task, 
some constraints work together with a date you choose. For example, if you 
want a task to start no later than a certain date, you select a date by which 
the task must start. Other settings, such as As Soon As Possible, work from 
a different date — in this case, the start date you set for the whole project or 
any dependency relationships you set up with other tasks. (See Chapter 4 for 
more about dependency relationships.)
To set a task constraint, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click a task.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Advanced tab (refer to Figure 5-1).
	
3.	Select a constraint from the Constraint Type list.
	
4.	If the constraint requires a date, select one from the Constraint Date 
list.
	
5.	Click the OK button to save the settings.
	
The default constraint, As Soon As Possible, is already set, so you usually 
don’t need to modify it.
Setting a deadline
Sometimes I think that deadlines were made to be overlooked. Project agrees 
because, strictly speaking, deadlines aren’t constraints (though the setting 
for the deadline is in the Constraint Task area of the Task Information dialog 
box, on the Advanced tab). Deadlines, which aren’t the same as constraints, 
don’t force the timing of task schedules. If you set a deadline and the task 
exceeds it, Project simply displays a symbol in the Indicator column to alert 
you so that you can panic — I mean, take action — appropriately.
To set a deadline, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click a task.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Advanced tab (refer to Figure 5-1).
	
3.	Click the arrow in the Deadline field to display a calendar and then 
select a date.

80
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
	 If necessary, click the forward- or backward-facing arrow to move to a 
different month.
	
4.	Click the OK button to save the deadline setting.
	
Display a Deadline column in the Gantt Chart sheet pane to enter the deadline 
or to show yourself and others your targeted deadline date.
Starting and Pausing Tasks
When most people start using Project, they initially try to enter a start date 
for every task in the project. After all, you include dates when you create 
to-do lists, right? You’re jumping the gun, though, and missing out on one of 
the great strengths of project management software: the capability to sched­
ule tasks according to sometimes-complex combinations of factors, such 
as dependencies between tasks and task constraints. By allowing Project to 
determine the start date of a task, you allow it to make adjustments automati­
cally when changes occur.
If you enter a task duration but not a start date for an automatically sched­
uled task, that task starts by default as soon as possible after the project 
start date that you specified in the Project Information dialog box, based on 
any dependencies you set up between tasks. For manually scheduled tasks, 
you eventually have to specify a start date to set the beginning schedule for 
the task.
To establish a task’s start date, you typically look for an aspect of the project 
that would dictate its timing. For example, if you want construction to begin 
only after you obtain permits, set a dependency between the Permits task 
and the Construction task in such a way that construction can begin only 
after the permit task ends.
Certain tasks, however, must start on a specific date. Examples are holidays, 
annual meetings, and the first day of the fishing season.
	
Project sets the finish date of a task based on when the task starts and on the 
task duration — along with any calendar that has been set up. If a task must 
finish on a certain date, however, you can set a finish date and let Project 
determine the start date.

81
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
Entering the task’s start date
Setting a start date or a finish date for a task applies a kind of constraint on 
it that can override dependency relationships or other timing factors. A task 
constraint is the preferred way to force a task to start or end on a certain 
day. If you determine, however, that a particular task must begin or end on a 
set date no matter what, you can enter a specific start or finish date. Setting 
the start or finish date is simple.
To enter a start or finish date for a task, simply follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click a task.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the General tab, if it’s not already displayed.
	
3.	Click the drop-down arrow at the end of the Start box or the 
Finish box.
	
	 A calendar appears.
	
4.	Click a date to select it, or click the forward- or backward-facing arrow 
to move to a different month and select a date.
	
	 If the current date is the date you want, take a shortcut and click the 
Today button on the drop-down calendar.
	
5.	Click the OK button.
	
When Project determines timing, a Must Start On constraint overrides the 
start date that is calculated based on start dates and durations. 
Taking a break: Splitting tasks
Did you ever start a task — filing your taxes, for example — and find that you 
simply had to drop everything before you were done and go do something 
else? (In the case of filing my taxes, I usually need a break for a good cry.)
Projects work the same way. Sometimes, tasks start and then have to be placed 
on hold before they can start again later — for example, if you experience a 
work shutdown caused by labor negotiations. Or perhaps you can anticipate 
a delay in the course of a task and you want to structure it that way when 
you create it. In this case, you can use a Project feature to split a task so that 
a second or third portion starts at a later date, with no activity in the interim. 
You can place as many splits in a task as you like.

82
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Follow these steps to split a task:
	
1.	On the Task tab of the Ribbon, click the Split Task button in the 
Schedule group.
	
	 A readout appears and guides you as you set the start date for the con­
tinuation of the task.
	
2.	Move the mouse pointer over the task bar on the Gantt chart, and 
adjust the pointer’s position until the box displays the date on which 
you want to start the task split; then drag to the right until the box 
contains the date on which you want the task to begin again.
	
3.	Release the mouse button.
	
	 The split task shows up as a short task, a series of dots, and then the 
rest of the task, as shown in Figure 5-3.
	
To rejoin a split task, place the mouse cursor over the task bar until the move 
cursor appears, and then drag the split task bar backward to join with the 
other portion of the task bar.
	
Figure 5-3: 
Splitting a 
task.
	

83
 Chapter 5: Estimating Task Time
	
Don’t use the split-task approach to place an artificial hold on a task until 
another task is complete. Suppose that you start testing a product and then 
have to wait for approval before finalizing the test results. In this case, create 
a Testing task, a Final Approval milestone, and a Finalize Test Results task — 
and then create dependency relationships among them. This way, if a task 
runs late, your final task shifts along with it instead of being set in stone (as a 
split task can be).

n Project, a view is a way to display task and resource information. It’s 
essentially a template with a predetermined set of columns in the work­
sheet, a way to enter data in a pane, or a way to view data in a chart. Though 
earlier chapters in this book describe how to enter task information into a 
worksheet in Gantt Chart view (the default view and the most common view), 
it is by no means the only way to look at data in Project. Project has 27 differ­
ent views that you can use to look at and analyze your project data.
After you know how to enter basic task information into Project, you can 
begin to display the information in different ways. First, I give you a high-level 
explanation of views and then dip into more detail about the more common 
views. Though I can’t possibly cover every combination of data that you 
might want to see, I show you how to customize the views in Project to look 
at data in the way that best suits your needs at the time.
A Project with a View
Views organize data so that you can see information in logical ways. Because 
of the complexity of information in a typical Project schedule, Project offers 
many views for slicing and dicing (organizing) the information. If an average 
word processing document is as complex as a cookie, your average Project 
file is more like a five-tier wedding cake adorned with intricate flowers and 
garlands in delicate swirls of sugary icing.

86
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
A Project file holds information about these elements:
	
✓	Tasks: Task name, duration, start and finish dates, assigned resources, 
costs, constraints, and dependencies, for example
	
✓	Resources: Resource name, resource type, rate per hour, overtime rate, 
department, cost per use, and others
	
✓	Assignments: Information about which resources will complete which 
tasks, including hours of work, units of effort, and remaining work
	
✓	Timing and progress: Several types of calendars, project start and finish 
dates, percentage of tasks completed, resource hours spent, baseline 
information, critical path information, and more
	
✓	Financial information: Earned value, time-and-cost variance, and pro­
jected costs for work not completed, for example
Navigating tabs and views
For each project schedule file you create, Project essentially builds an exten­
sive database of information. The different views in Project enable you to 
zero in on different combinations of the data you need. Having several views 
from which to observe your project information is helpful, but having all 
those views does you no good if you don’t know how to move around in a 
view after you find it or how to move from one to another.
One way to move from one view to another is by using the Task tab on the 
Ribbon. Clicking the bottom section (with the down arrow) of the Gantt Chart 
button to the left of the Task tab displays a menu of Project’s most-often-used 
views, as shown in Figure 6-1, as well as any custom views you create. Simply 
click any listed view to display it. In case it isn’t obvious, clicking the top 
section of the Gantt Chart button redisplays Gantt Chart view.
You can see the same list of views by clicking the View group’s Team Planner 
drop-down on the Resource tab.
Clicking the View tab on the Ribbon gives you all kinds of options for selecting 
a view. Using the Task Views group on the far left end, you can select the 
Gantt Chart, Task Usage, Network Diagram, Calendar, Task Sheet, or Timeline 
view. The Resource Views group enables you to select the Team Planner, 
Resource Usage, Resource Sheet, or Resource Form view. Other groups on 
the View tab offer choices for sorting data, changing the timescale, and zoom­
ing a view to see it better. You can also split the view by adding the timescale 
to whichever view is active, or you can add details to a specific view. Check 
out Chapter 1 for more on navigating around Project 2013.

The lower-right corner of the Project window has buttons for jumping directly 
to the Gantt Chart, Task Usage, Team Planner, Resource Sheet, and Report 
Planner views.
In addition to the views you can display via the Task tab or the View tab, you 
may need to use one of the dozen or so other views as you work on your 
project. To display views not directly available via the Ribbon, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Select either the Task tab or Resource tab on the Ribbon.
	
2.	Click the bottom part of the Gantt Chart button.
	
3.	Click More Views at the bottom of the menu.
	
	 The More Views dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.

4.	Use the scroll bar to locate the view you want.
	
5.	Select the view you want and click the Apply button.
	
If you liked the View bar that was available in earlier versions of Project, you 
can still use it: Right-click the gray bar on the left side of Project, and choose 
View Bar to display the View bar. To hide it again, right-click the View bar and 
choose View Bar.
Scrolling around
The simplest views, such as Calendar view, have a single pane, with horizon­
tal and vertical scroll bars. Other views, such as Resource Usage view (shown 
in Figure 6-3), have two panes: Each pane has its own horizontal scroll bar, 
and because the panes share the vertical scroll bar, the panes move up and 
down together.
In most views with two panes, the pane to the left is the sheet — a spreadsheet-
like interface that displays columns of information. To the right of this view is 
the chart; it uses bars, symbols, and lines to represent each task in your project 
and the dependency relationships among them.
	
Figure 6-3: 
Multiple

89
 Chapter 6: Check Out This View!
At the top of the chart area is the timescale. This tool is used as a scale against 
which you can interpret the timing of the task bars. To see your plan in greater 
or lesser timing detail, you modify the time units used in the timescale. For 
example, you can look at your tasks in detail over days or in a broader over­
view in months.
	
See the “Changing the timescale” section, later in this chapter, to find out how 
to change the time increments displayed in the timescale.
By using the horizontal scroll bars in each pane, you can view additional 
columns or additional periods in any pane with a timescale. Timescale panes 
cover the life of the project.
Use these methods to work with scroll bars:
	
✓	Drag the scroll box on a scroll bar until you reach the location in the 
pane that you want to look at. When you drag the scroll box to move in 
a timescale display, the date display indicates where you are at any time 
in the scrolling calendar. Release the mouse button when the date display 
matches the date you want to view.
	
✓	Click to the left or right of the horizontal scroll box to move one page 
at a time. Note that a page in this instance is controlled to some extent 
by how you resize a given pane. For example, with a timescale pane 
and a timescale set to weeks, you move one week at a time. In a sheet 
pane that displays three columns, you move to the next (or preceding) 
column.
	
✓	Click the right or left arrow at either end of a scroll bar to move in 
smaller increments. On a sheet pane, you move about one half column 
per click. In a timescale view with weeks displayed, you move about a 
day at a time.
Reaching a specific spot in your plan
To reach a particular area of your Project plan, you can also press the F5 key 
to use the Go To feature. Simply enter either of two items in the Go To dialog 
box when you want to find a task:
	
✓	A date from a drop-down calendar
	
✓	A task ID
You can also click the Scroll to Task button on the Task tab of the Ribbon (or 
press Ctrl+Shift+F5) to scroll the chart pane of the view to show the task bar 
for a selected task in the sheet pane.

90
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
The task ID, which is a number that’s assigned automatically whenever you 
create a task, provides a unique identifier for every task in the plan.
	
To see more or less detail in your schedule, use the Zoom command on the 
View tab — in every view. Read more about using the Zoom button in the side­
bar “Zooming in and out,” later in this chapter.
For more about modifying the format of elements displayed in a view, see 
Chapter 13.
More Detail about Views
Finding out how to use Project views to enter, edit, review, and analyze 
Project data can help you focus your attention on the aspects of the project 
you are interested in, whether it’s resources, budget, task sequencing, or 
some other aspect. Don’t worry that you’ll be overwhelmed by the number of 
views you can use: After a while, using them will become second nature.
This section describes the most common views: Gantt Chart, Resource Sheet, 
Team Planner, Network Diagram, Timeline, and Calendar.
Home base: Gantt Chart view
Gantt Chart view is similar to a favorite room in your house — the place 
where your family members most often hang out. It’s the view that appears 
first whenever you open a new project. Gantt Chart view, shown in Figure 6-4, 
is a combination of spreadsheet data and a chart with a graphical representa­
tion of tasks; it offers a wealth of information in one place. The spreadsheet 
can display any combination of columns of data that you want.
Gantt Chart view has two major sections: the sheet pane on the left and the 
chart pane on the right. In Gantt Chart view (or in any view with a sheet 
pane), you can use tables to specify which information is shown in the sheet. 
A table is a preset combination of columns (fields) of data that you can easily 
display by choosing View, selecting the Data Group, and choosing one of nine 
preset tables:
	
✓	Cost
	
✓	Entry (the default table)
	
✓	Hyperlink
	
✓	Schedule

91
Chapter 6: Check Out This View!	
✓	Tracking	
✓	Variance	
✓	 Work	
✓	Summary	
✓	 Usage
You can also customize the column display of any table by displaying or hiding 
individual columns of data, one at a time. (See the section “Displaying different 
columns,” later in this chapter, for information about this procedure.)

Resourceful views: Resource 
Sheet and Team Planner
In Resource Sheet view, shown in Figure 6-5, you add the resources that will 
handle the work in your project. You can type entries in cells and press the 
Tab and arrow keys to move around. Chapter 7 describes the purpose of 
each field in this view and tells you how to set up your resource information 
correctly.

92
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
	
Figure 6-5: 
Resource 
Sheet view.
	
Team Planner view, shown in Figure 6-6, shows you what each team member 
is scheduled to work on, and when. You can change an assignment by simply 
dragging it from one resource to another. Voilà — assignment problems 
solved! You can find out more about this view in Chapter 9.
Getting your timing down 
with the Timeline
Your manager and the project’s client may not want to see every detail in 
your grand plan. If you need to share project information with a person 
whose eyes glaze over easily, meet your new best friend: the Project 
Timeline. Appearing in its own, small pane (by default) with certain other 
views, it presents a simplified picture of the entire schedule. When used with 
a view such as Gantt Chart, as shown in Figure 6-7, the portions of the sched­
ule that aren’t visible in the chart pane are shaded. You can also display 
individual tasks or milestones on the Timeline. Chapter 18 delves into how to 
work with the Timeline and use it as a communication tool.

Going with the flow: Network 
Diagram view
The organization of information in Network Diagram view, as shown in 
Figure 6-8, represents the workflow in your project in a series of task boxes. 
The boxes include dependency lines that connect them to reflect the 
sequence of tasks. (See Chapter 4 for more about dependency relationships.) 

94
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
You read this view from left to right; earlier tasks on the left flow into later 
tasks and subtasks to the right. Tasks that happen in the same time frame are 
aligned vertically above each other. Tasks with an X through them have been 
marked as complete. Additionally, tasks with only one line through them 
have been worked only partially and are less than 100 percent complete.
	
Traditionally known as a PERT chart, the network diagram method was devel­
oped by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s for use in building the Polaris missile program.
Network Diagram view has no timescale; the view isn’t used to see specific 
timing, but to see the general logical order of tasks in a plan. However, each 
task box, or node, holds specific timing information about each task, such as 
its start date, finish date, and duration. (You can customize the information 
in the task boxes, as described in the later section “Customizing Views.”) 
Timeline view appears by default along the top of this view.

Network 
Diagram 
view.
	
Calling up Calendar view
Who can conceive of creating a schedule without opening a calendar? This 
familiar view of time is one of the many views offered in Project. Calendar 
view, as shown in Figure 6-9, looks like a monthly wall calendar, with boxes 

95
 Chapter 6: Check Out This View!
that represent days on a calendar in rows that represent the days in a week. 
Using this view, you can see all tasks that are scheduled to happen in any 
given day, week, or month.
You can modify Calendar view to display as many weeks as you need by 
clicking the Custom button located directly along the upper-left side of the 
calendar and changing the Number of Weeks setting in the Zoom dialog box.
	
More than two dozen views are built into Project. You encounter many more 
as you work on specific elements of Project in this book.
	
Figure 6-9: 
Calendar 
view.
	
Customizing Views
Just when you thought you were starting to get a handle on the two dozen or 
so views available in Project, I dazzle you with even more possibilities: Every 
one of those views can be customized to show a different type of information.
You can customize every view in Project to show specific types of information. 
For example, you can choose to show columns of information in spreadsheets, 
labels in Network Diagram boxes or task bars, and sets of data in graph views. 
You can also modify the size of panes of information and adjust the timescale.

96
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
Why all this flexibility with the information you see on-screen? At various times 
in a project, you need to focus on different aspects of your tasks. If you’re 
having a problem with costs, take a look at Resource Usage view and insert 
various columns of cost information, such as resource rates and total actual 
costs. If your plan is taking longer than the Hundred Years’ War, consider dis­
playing Tracking Gantt view and looking at a bunch of baseline columns with 
timing and dependency data or examining the project’s critical path in the 
chart pane. If you need to display more of the sheet area so that you can read 
those columns without having to scroll, you can do that, too. In the following 
sections, you find out how to do all the things you need to do to show a vari­
ety of information in each view.
Working with view panes
In addition to Gantt Chart view, several views have two panes, such as Task 
Usage, Tracking Gantt, and Resource Usage. When the Timeline appears with 
a view, it appears in a third, horizontal pane at the top. You can modify the 
information you see in the sheet pane as well as the scale for timing in the 
chart pane. You can also display information near task bars in the chart pane.
Resizing a pane
In views that show more than one pane, you can reduce or enlarge each 
pane. This capability helps you see more information in one area, depending 
on your focus at the time.
	
The overall area occupied by the panes is constant, so when you enlarge one 
pane, you reduce the other.
Follow these steps to change the size of a pane in a view:
	
1.	Place the mouse pointer over the edge of a pane.
	
2.	When you see a pointer composed of a line and two arrows pointing 
in opposite directions, you can drag the pointer to resize the pane:
 
• Drag to the left: Enlarge the pane on the right.
 
• Drag to the right: Enlarge the pane on the left.
 
• Drag up or down: Change the size of the Timeline pane versus the 
area that’s available for the rest of the view.
	
3.	Release the mouse button.
	
	 The panes are resized.

Changing the timescale
I wish I could tell you that Project lets you control time and bestow lots more 
of it on your project, but it doesn’t. What it does allow you to do is modify 
the timescale to display your plan in larger or smaller time increments.
A timescale consists of a possible total of three tiers that you can use to dis­
play different time increments. For example, the top tier can mark months; 
the middle tier, weeks; and the bottom tier, days. This variety of detail lets 
you easily observe the overall task length and points in time during the life 
of the task. You can use all three tiers, only the middle tier, or the middle 
and bottom tiers (as shown in Figure 6-10). This feature is especially helpful 
because projects can span several weeks to several years, such as construc­
tion or pharmaceutical projects. This scaling feature is the only way to view 
such large-scale efforts.
	
Figure 6-10: 
The three-
tiered 
Timescale 
dialog box.
	
You can modify the units of time and the alignment of each tier and also add 
tick lines to mark the beginning of each increment on the timescale. You also 
decide whether to include nonworking time on the timescale. For example, if 
you add an indication of nonworking time on a project for which weekends 
are nonworking, Saturdays and Sundays are indicated by a shaded area in the 
display, which can make a useful visual divider between weeks.
You can also display text labels near task bars and specify which data is 
included. Labels can be placed above, below, inside, or to the left or right of 
the task bars. Especially in projects where you display many columns of data 
and a lengthy schedule, a task bar can be placed far to the right of the sheet 
pane data. You can then include information such as task name or start date 
alongside the task bar to make your plan more readable.

98
Part I: Getting Started with Project 2013 
To modify the timescale, select the View tab, click the drop-down arrow next 
to Timescale in the Zoom group, and choose the time increments you want 
visible on the chart. If you select Timescale in the drop-down list, you can 
modify the information on any of the three tiers. Here’s how:
	
1.	Click the View tab.
	
2.	Select the Timescale format at the bottom of the Timescale drop-down 
menu.
	
	 The Timescale dialog box opens (refer to Figure 6-10).
	
3.	Click a tier tab and select a style for Units, Label, and Align.
	
4.	Set the count.
	
	 For example, if your Units choice is weeks and you change the Count 
option to 2, the timescale appears in two-week increments.
	
5.	To prevent the display of a certain tier, select One Tier or Two Tiers 
from the Show drop-down list in the Timescale Options section.
	
6.	If you want Project to use fiscal-year notation in the timescale, select 
the Use Fiscal Year check box.
	
	 For example, if your 2013 fiscal year begins July 1, 2013, 2014 applies 
to all months in the fiscal year. Set the fiscal year by choosing File➪
Options➪Schedule.
	
7.	To show marks at the beginning of each unit of time, select the Tick 
Lines check box.
	
8.	Repeat Steps 2 through 6 for each tier that you want to modify.
	
9.	Click the Non-Working Time tab.
	
10.	In the Draw options, select the one you prefer.
	
	 Your choices are to have the shaded area for nonworking time appear 
behind task bars or in front of task bars or to simply not appear.
	
11.	In the Color or Pattern list, select different options for the shading 
format.
	
12.	Click the Calendar setting and select a different calendar on which to 
base the timescale.
	
	 You can find out more about calendar choices in Chapter 8.
	
13.	Click the OK button to save your new settings, which apply only to the 
timescale for the currently displayed view.
	
Use the Size setting on the three tier tabs to shrink the display proportionately 
and to squeeze more information on your screen or the printed page.

99
 Chapter 6: Check Out This View!
	
Use these keystroke combinations to navigate the timescale:
	
✓	Alt+Home: Move to the beginning of the project.
	
✓	Alt+End: Move to the end of the project.
	
✓	Alt+right arrow: Scroll the timescale to the right.
	
✓	Alt+left arrow: Scroll the timescale to the left.
	
✓	Alt+Page Down: Move the timescale one page to the right.
	
✓	Alt+Page Up: Move the timescale one page to the left.
	
	(Pressing the Ctrl key does the same thing as Alt+Page Up, except that 
you’re moving within the sheet view to the left.)
Displaying different columns
Each spreadsheet view has certain default columns of data that are stored 
in tables. Gantt Chart view with the Tracking table displayed, for example, 
has data related to the progress of tasks. The Resource sheet contains many 
columns of data about resources that can be useful for entering new resource 
information. In addition to choosing to display predefined tables of columns, 
you can modify any spreadsheet table to display any columns you like.
To insert a column, click Insert Column on the Format tab, or follow this pro­
cedure to show selected columns of data:
	
1.	Scroll the table to the right, and click the Add New Column heading.
	
	 A list of available columns appears, as shown in Figure 6-11.
Zooming in and out
One way to modify the display of any Project 
view is to use the Zoom menu on the View tab 
of the Ribbon. This feature shows you a longer 
or shorter period in your project without your 
having to change the timescale settings manu­
ally. When you need to see several years at a 
time in your project, for example, click Zoom 
and then Zoom Out several times until as many 
months or years as you like can fit into the view.
You can also choose Zoom Entire Project in the 
Zoom group to show the entire project on the 
screen. Another nifty technique is to click the 
Zoom Selected Tasks button. The chart moves 
so that the bar representing the task is shown 
on the chart screen. Another quick (but less 
precise) way to zoom is to use the Zoom slider 
in the lower-right corner of the Project window. 
Drag it left to zoom out and drag right to zoom in.

	 Typing the first letter of the field name scrolls the list more quickly.
	
3.	If you want to enter a different label for the field heading, right-click 
and choose Field Settings; type the name in the Title box and click the 
OK button.
	
	 The title in the current view appears in the column heading for this field.
	
4.	Move the mouse pointer over the column heading, drag the column 
to the left or right, and reposition the column where you want it relo­
cated within the table.
	
To hide a column, right-click its heading in the sheet pane and then choose 
Hide Column. Or, to insert a column at a particular location, right-click the 
column heading at that location and choose Insert Column. It’s then inserted 
directly to the left of the selected column.
	
You can display preset tables of sheet data, such as Tracking for recording 
progress on tasks or Entry for entering new task information: Simply choose 
View➪Tables (in the Data group) and then click the name of the table you 
want to display.

Modifying Network Diagram view
Network Diagram view, which is useful for understanding the flow of tasks 
throughout your project, can help you understand which series of tasks 
determines the overall project duration. Known as the critical path, it’s the 
longest chain of tasks (in duration, not in number of tasks) in your project. 
The tasks on the critical path are critical tasks; tasks that aren’t on the criti­
cal path are noncritical tasks.
When you first display Network Diagram view, you see boxes of various types — 
one for each task in your project. You can modify the information contained 
in those boxes and modify the field formatting.
By default, a typical task contains the task name, task ID, start date, finish date, 
duration, and resource name. A milestone displays only the milestone date, 
milestone name, and task ID number.
Different categories of tasks (such as critical or noncritical) can contain differ­
ent information, and you can modify the field information contained in any 
individual box or category of boxes.
See Chapter 4 for more on adding information about tasks and milestones.
Changing what’s in the box
Sometimes, you want to see information about task timing, and at other times, 
you focus on other issues, such as resources. To accommodate these various 
information needs, Network Diagram view allows you to use various templates 
for the information contained in the diagram boxes.
To modify the information included in these boxes, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click anywhere in Network Diagram view outside any box and 
choose Box Styles.
	
	 The Box Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-12.
	
2.	In the Style Settings For list, select a task category.
	
3.	To modify the data included in the task boxes, select a different tem­
plate from the Data Template list.
	
	 You can choose additional templates (and edit any template to include 
whatever data you like) by clicking the More Templates button.
	
	 A preview of the data included in the template appears in the Preview area.
	
4.	Click the OK button to save the new template.

You can also apply different templates to each box separately by right-clicking 
a box (rather than clicking outside it), choosing Format Box, selecting a differ­
ent template from the Data Template drop-down list, and then clicking the OK 
button.
Beautifying diagram boxes
Are you the creative type? Do you dislike the shape or color of the boxes in 
Network Diagram view? Do you want to add shading to the box backgrounds? 
Project lets you do all this and more.
Follow these steps to modify the format of Network Diagram boxes:
	
1.	Right-click anywhere in Network Diagram view outside any box and 
choose Box Styles.
	
	 The Box Styles dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Shape drop-down list and select a different shape from the 
list that appears.
	
3.	Click the Color drop-down list in the Border section and select a dif­
ferent color from the list of colors.
	
	 Note: This choice specifies the color of the line that forms the box, not a 
background color. For that topic, see Step 5 in this list.

103
 Chapter 6: Check Out This View!
	
4.	Click the Width drop-down list and select a line width from the ones 
that are displayed.
	
5.	Click the Color drop-down list in the Background section and select a 
color for the background that fills the inside of each box.
	
6.	Click the Pattern drop-down list and select a pattern of lines to fill the 
interior of each box.
	
7.	Click the OK button to save the new settings.
	
Combinations of certain patterns and colors in backgrounds can make the text 
in the box difficult to read, so look at the preview in the Box Styles dialog box 
to ensure that your combination works.
A neat trick in Network Diagram view is to edit the layout to show link labels. 
(Right-click outside any task nodes, choose Layout, and then select the Show 
Link Labels check box.) A code, such as FS for finish-to-start, is displayed to 
explain the type of dependency that each dependency line represents. You 
can also collapse the boxes so that only the task number appears. Simply 
right-click outside a box and select Collapse Boxes. You might also want to 
zoom the Network Diagram view to show as much information as you need. 
Figure 6-13 shows collapsed diagram boxes and the link labels on the depen­
dency lines.

You can also format individual boxes by right-clicking a box, choosing Format 
Box, and then following the steps in this section.
Modifying the Network Diagram layout
You can modify the layout of Network Diagram view by right-clicking outside 
a box and selecting Layout. As shown in Figure 6-14, you can either allow 
Project to position the boxes or position them manually. You can also define 
how to lay out the boxes and whether to show summary tasks.
	
Figure 6-14:

view.
	
Cosmetic options include defining the link style and whether to show link 
labels or connector arrows. You can set the critical path to show in a specific 
color (red is the default) and change the background color.
Resetting the view
Most changes you make in a view apply as long as you have saved them. But 
if you’ve made so many changes that the view is now messy, you can reset it 
at any time: Click the Task tab on the Ribbon, click the bottom of the Gantt 
Chart button, and click Reset to Default. The view reverts to the default view.

Creating Resources
In This Chapter
▶	 Understanding work and material resources
▶	 Creating resources to complete your project
▶	 Setting resource availability
▶	 Benefitting from resource groups and shared resources
P
rojects utilize people, equipment, and materials, and these people, 
equipment, and materials are the project resources.
Using resources wisely is the delicate art of combining the right resource 
with the right skills and assigning that resource to invest the right amount 
of time (or units) for tasks. And you have to do this without overbooking 
anyone at any point in the schedule.
A resource, because it affects timing and costs, is a big deal in Project. For this 
reason, many tools are available to help you create resources, specify how and 
when they’ll work, assign them to tasks, manage their costs, and manipulate 
their workload. The first step in working with resources is to create them and 
enter certain information about them. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Resources: People, Places, and Things
Many people hear the word resources and think that it means people. Well, 
people are indeed frequently used as project resources, but they’re only 
part of the story. Resources can also consist of equipment you rent or buy 
or materials such as wood or scrap iron. You can even create resources that 
represent facilities you have to rent by the hour, such as laboratories or 
meeting spaces.

108
Part II: Managing Resources 
Here are some typical project resources (and one not-so-typical resource):
	
✓	Engineer
	
✓	Office supplies
	
✓	Hotel ballroom
	
✓	Administrative assistants
	
✓	Furniture
	
✓	Computer software
	
✓	Graphical designer
	
✓	Rocket fuel
You get the picture. Resources can be practically anything or anyone that 
you use to complete your project.
	
You can also create a resource as a cost placeholder if you’re tracking costs 
using Project. For example, you might assign a resource named Plant Visit a 
cost of $750 to cover airfare, hotel, and rental car charges for the visit.
Becoming Resource-Full
After you create and organize the tasks in your project, the next step, typically, 
is to create its resources. Before you create resources in Project 2013 willy-
nilly, though, you must understand how they affect your project.
Understanding resources
First and foremost, a resource is an asset that helps accomplish a project, 
whether the asset is a person, a piece of equipment, a material, or a supply. 
One aspect of working with resources effectively is to manage the workflow 
of any resource that has limited time availability for your project. When you 
create resources, you indicate their availability by hours in the day or days 
of the week. For example, one person may be available 50 percent of the 
time, or 20 hours in the standard 40-hour workweek, whereas another may 
be available full time (40 hours). When you assign these kinds of resources 
to your project, you can use various views, reports, and tools to see whether 
any resource is overbooked at any point during the project. You can also see 
whether people are sitting around, twiddling their thumbs, when they may 
be available to help on another task. You can even account for resources that 

109
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
work on multiple projects across your organization and ensure that they’re 
being used efficiently.
Another aspect of working with resources effectively is understanding how 
the number of resources you assign to work on a task affects the duration of 
that task. In other words, if you have a certain amount of work to perform but 
few people to do that work, a typical task takes longer to finish than if scads 
of folks are available.
	
The task type determines whether a task’s duration changes based on the 
number of resources assigned to it. (Chapter 5 describes task types.)
Finally, resources add costs to a project. To account for costs in your project — 
such as a person working many hours on a task, computers that you have to 
buy, or services that require fees — you must create resources and assign 
them to one or more tasks. I discuss project costs in Chapter 9.
Resource types: Work, material, and cost
For the purposes of resource planning, Project recognizes only these three 
types of resources:
	
✓	Work: This person, such as a programmer or plumber, can be reas­
signed but not depleted. Work resources are assigned to tasks to accom­
plish work.
	
✓	Material: Material has a unit cost and doesn’t consume working hours, 
but it can be depleted. Examples of material costs are steel, wood, and 
books.
	
✓	Cost: Using a cost resource gives you the flexibility to specify the appli­
cable cost, such as travel or shipping, every time you use the resource.
	
Deciding which resource type to use when adding an external vendor or 
equipment resource to the project can be tricky. If you want to avoid adding 
hours of work to the project when that resource is being used, don’t set up 
the resource as a work resource. Use a cost resource or fixed-cost approach 
instead.
How resources affect task timing
Under Project 2013’s default settings, effort-driven scheduling is turned off 
for both manually and automatically scheduled tasks. So no matter how 

110
Part II: Managing Resources 
many work resources you assign, the task duration stays the same and 
Project piles on more hours of work for the task, to reflect more effort.
However, in some cases of a fixed-unit or fixed-work task type, the addition 
or removal of resources assigned to the task should have an impact on the 
time it takes to complete the task. In essence, the old maxim “Two heads are 
better than one” may be modified to “Two heads are faster than one.”
Suppose that one person is assigned to the Dig Ditch task, which requires 
four hours of effort. Two people assigned to the Dig Ditch task will finish 
the job in two hours because two hours are being worked by each resource 
simultaneously, which achieves four hours of effort in half the time. To make 
scheduling a task work this way, you first have to change the task to an auto-
scheduled task by using the Auto Schedule button in the Schedule group on 
the Task tab. Then you have to turn on effort-driven scheduling by double-
clicking the task, clicking the Advance tab in the Task Information dialog box, 
selecting the Effort Driven check box, and then clicking the OK button. (I dis­
cuss effort-driven tasks in Chapter 5.)
	
Assigning additional people to tasks doesn’t always shorten work time propor­
tionately, even though that’s how Project calculates it. When you have more 
people, you also have more meetings, memos, duplicated effort, and conflicts, 
for example. If you add more resources to a task, consider also increasing the 
amount of effort required to complete that task to account for inevitable work­
group inefficiencies.
Estimating resource requirements
You usually know how many material resources it takes to complete a task: 
In most cases, you can use a standard formula to calculate the number of 
pounds, tons, yards, or another quantity. But how do you know how much 
effort your work resources must invest to complete the tasks in the project?
	
Include a certain amount of extra material resources if you think you will need 
it for rework or scrap.
As with many aspects of information you put into a Project plan, determining 
the level of effort rests to a great degree on your own experience with similar 
tasks and resources. Still, remember these caveats:
	
✓	Skill counts. A less skilled or less experienced resource is likely to take 
more time to finish a task. Experiment — increase the duration by 20 
percent for a less skilled resource, for example, or reduce it by 20 per­
cent for a more skilled resource.

111
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
	
✓	History repeats itself. Look at previously completed projects and tasks. 
If you’ve tracked people’s time, you can likely see how much effort was 
required in order to complete various types of tasks on other projects 
and draw parallels to your project. This technique for estimating effort 
duration is similar to analogous estimating, covered in Chapter 5.
	
✓	Ask and you shall receive. Ask the resources themselves to estimate 
how long they think a task will take. After all, the people doing the work 
should know best how long it takes.
	
Allow for reserve time in a project to account for unforeseen circumstances, 
such as resources being less skilled than you had planned. To ensure that 
milestone dates are met, many people add a task called Contingency Reserve 
to their schedules immediately before a milestone delivery or the end of a 
phase.
The Birth of a Resource
Just as someone fills out the birth certificate whenever a baby is born, a 
form is filled out whenever a resource in Project is born (that is, created). On 
the Resource Information form, you enter information such as the resource 
name, its availability, and the rate per hour or cost per use. You can also 
enter optional information, such as the group (company workgroup) to 
which the resource belongs or the resource’s e-mail address.
You can create a resource as a single person or entity, a generic resource 
(such as a skill set with no person assigned, such as Assistant or Engineer), 
or even a group of several resources that work together. Many times in the 
early stages of project planning, you know only the resource skill you need, 
to be replaced later by a named individual who has both the time and the 
qualifications to complete the task. 
Creating one resource at a time
On the simplest level, a resource (a person, a piece of equipment, or a mate­
rial) is created as a single entity — a particular person or a meeting room or 
a piece of equipment. You create the resource by entering information in the 
Resource Information dialog box.
When you create a resource, you must type, at minimum, the resource name, 
though you can also add as much information as you want. Some people 
prefer to create all the resources first and add contact and cost information 

112
Part II: Managing Resources 
later. In Chapter 9, I describe in detail how to add the cost information for 
resources.
To create a resource using the Resource Information dialog box, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Click the bottom of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the 
Ribbon, and click Resource Sheet.
	
2.	Double-click a blank cell in the Resource Name column.
	
	 You can also click the Information button in the Properties group on the 
Resource tab.
	
	 The Resource Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
	
3.	Type a name in the Resource Name text box.
	
4.	Click the down arrow in the Type box (on the right) to choose Work, 
Material, or Cost.
	
	 The settings that are available to you differ slightly, depending on which 
option you choose. For example, a material resource has neither the 
Email nor Logon Account option, and a work resource or cost resource 
has no Material Label option.
	
5.	For a material resource, enter a description of the units in the Material 
Label field.
	
	 For example, you might enter pounds for a Flour resource or tons for a 
Steel resource.
	
Figure 7-1: 
These 
four tabs 
can hold a 
wealth of 
information 
about any 
resource.
	

113
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
	
6.	In the Initials field, type an abbreviation or initials for the resource.
	
	 If you don’t enter anything, the first letter of the resource name is 
inserted when you save the resource.
	
7.	Continue to enter any information you want to include about the 
resource.
	
	 This information may include an e-mail address, the group type (a 
department, division, or workgroup, for example), booking type (pro­
posed or committed), or code (such as a cost-center code).
	
	 If you enter information in the Group field, you can then use the Filter, 
Sort, and Group By features to look at sets of resources. (See Chapter 11 
for more about filtering and working with groups.)
	
8.	Click the OK button to save the new resource.
	
To enter information about several resources at a time, display Resource Sheet 
view and enter information in the columns. You can even paste resources 
copied from another source (such as an Excel spreadsheet) into this view.
Identifying resources before 
you know their names
In the planning stages of a project, you often find that not all resources are 
assembled. Even well into the project, sometimes you don’t know what resource 
you’ll be using; you know only that you need a resource with a certain skill 
set to complete upcoming tasks. In this case, consider creating certain 
resources as generic resources.
To create a generic resource, give it a name that describes its skill, such as 
Engineer, Designer, or even Meeting Space (rather than a specific resource 
named Conference Room B). Then, in the Resource Information dialog box, 
be sure to select the Generic check box.
You can then display a Yes/No column titled Generic to identify these resources, 
and you can create a resource filter to filter for a Yes or No entry in the Generic 
column to filter resources by this characteristic.
No formula exists for using the Generic setting to recalculate your schedule 
based on resource availability. However, many people find this setting useful 
when they use rolling wave planning or when they aren’t responsible for spe­
cific resource assignments (for example, assigning a temporary worker to a 
task when a temporary-hiring agency will choose the specific worker). For a 
refresher on rolling wave planning, see Chapter 3.

114
Part II: Managing Resources 
You can replace a generic resource name with the name of the resource 
that’s added to your project. For example, if you enter Engineer 1 as a 
resource, you can replace it with Jim Taylor, the name of the engineer who 
will do the work. To make the switch, go to Resource Sheet view and, in the 
Resource Name column, click the cell for the resource, type the new name, 
and press Enter. Don’t worry if you’ve already assigned the generic resource 
to tasks in the project. Project updates all assignments with the new name.
Many hands make light work
Rather than assign people individually to a task, you can assign a group of 
people who typically work together. Being able to make a single assignment 
of a consolidated resource rather than several separate resources and assign­
ments can be a time-saver in larger projects.
Suppose that you need eight security personnel for the Youth Center event, 
and you create a Security Personnel resource. You will have eight resources, 
so you enter 800% in the Units column to indicate eight full-time resources.
No special setting is used to designate a multiple resource. However, you may 
want to indicate the number of resources by adding it to the resource name. 
For example, name your security personnel resource Eight Security Personnel. 
The defining factor in this type of resource is the maximum number of assign­
ment units: 800% signifies eight resources in the group. Figure 7-2 shows 
Security Personnel with the Generic check box selected and the units at 800%.
	
Figure 7-2: 
Consolidated 
resource.
	

115
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
	
Assigning a resource at less than 100 percent units creates a part-time assign­
ment. Of course, another option is to keep the resource in the pool at 100 
percent and assign them only part time to a task. It’s your choice.
Managing Resource Availability
Lots of Project 2013 features handle resources — in particular by helping you 
spot resource overallocation. Overallocation is a calculation, based on the 
resource’s calendar and availability, indicating that too much work has been 
assigned based on this availability.
Consider Monica Mendez, an engineer who works a standard eight-hour day 
based on her calendar. Monica is assigned to the Write Final Report task at 
50 percent of her availability and to the Create Design Specs task — which 
occurs at the same time as the report task — at 100 percent of her availability. 
Monica is now working at 150 percent of her availability, or 12 hours per day. 
Poor Monica is overbooked. Be careful — she might even quit the project.
A resource is assigned to a task at 100 percent availability (or units) by default, 
but you can modify that setting if you know that a resource will be assigned to 
several tasks and can only spend a limited amount of time working each one. 
Estimating and setting availability
Availability is easier to estimate for some resources than for others. A manager 
is unlikely to devote an entire day to any single task, because he has to deal 
with all the employees who report to him and also sign authorizations, attend 
meetings concerning various projects, and develop budgets, for example. A 
production worker’s availability may be simpler to pin down to a single task: 
If one manufacturing job spends three days on the line and one person is work­
ing on the line the entire time, it’s more accurate to say that she is working 
on that task full time.
One mistake made by Project beginners is to overthink availability. Of course, 
no one spends eight hours every day on a single task in a project. Employees 
spend part of their workdays reading e-mail about company holidays, chatting 
with coworkers, and answering phone calls about issues unrelated to their 
projects (UFOs landing at the United Nations, for example). A resource may 
spend seven hours on a task one day and only three hours the next. Don’t get 
hung up on a day-by-day resource schedule when estimating availability. If, 
over the life of a task, the employee focuses on it, 100 percent availability is 
an appropriate setting. If that person works only five days on a ten-day task, 

116
Part II: Managing Resources 
however, that’s 50 percent availability, whether she works four hours per day 
for ten days or five full days at any point.
	
The Units (availability) setting helps you spot the overbooking of a resource 
who may work on multiple tasks at the same time in a project schedule.
To set default resource units to specify availability, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Sheet view.
	
2.	Click the Max column for the resource.
	
3.	Type a number representing the percentage of time that the resource 
is available to work on the project.
	
	 For example, type 33 for a resource who’s available one-third of the time 
or 400 for a resource who can provide four full-time workers. (Entries 
greater than 100 percent represent resources that provide a group or 
team to handle assignments.) The most common entry (the default) is 
100 for a single resource working full time on assignments in the project.
	
4.	Press Enter or Tab.
	
	The entry is completed.
When a resource comes and goes
In addition to being available to a project only a certain percentage of the 
time (say, 50 percent of the project’s entire duration), a resource may be 
available for only a certain period of time (perhaps April–June) during the life 
of the project — commonly, when you use a resource borrowed from another 
department or when you’re working with a freelancer who’s squeezing in 
your project with others. Another possible resource is one who’s available 
half time for the first few days of the project and then full time for the remain­
der. In this case, you enter a date range in the Available From and Available 
To columns of the Resource Availability area in the Resource Information 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-3, to specify varying availability.
To specify a limited period during which a resource is available to work on 
your project, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Sheet view.
	
2.	Double-click a resource.
	
	 The General tab of the Resource Information dialog box appears (refer 
to Figure 7-3).

117
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
	
3.	Use the Available From and Available To columns (in the Resource 
Availability area) to specify the period of availability.
	
4.	In the Units column in the same row, either click the arrows to raise 
or lower the availability in 50 percent increments, or type a number.
	
	Press Enter to finish the entry.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to specify additional periods of availability on 
subsequent rows in the Resource Availability area.
	
6.	Click the OK button to save the setting.

Creating sharer files
Both individual resources and generic 
resources can be created in a blank project as a 
resource pool and saved to an accessible loca­
tion on your company network. Then any proj­
ect manager can assign those resources to her 
own projects. These projects are then referred 
to as sharer files because they share resources 
from the resource pool. For example, if you have 
a pool of maintenance people whom everyone 
in your manufacturing company assigns to proj­
ects, create a Project file named Resource 
Pools and enter all the resources to share in 
Resource Sheet view. Or create the resource 
pool file named CEO and let everyone who 
is managing projects that require the CEO’s 
involvement and assign him from that central 
location. Then use the resource-sharing tools 
in Project to assign these resources to tasks 
within your plan.
When anyone uses resource assignments from 
a sharer file, that information is also saved in 
the resource pool file. Then anyone can use 
that file to look at resource allocations across 
all projects in the organization.

118
Part II: Managing Resources 
Sharing Resources
Many organizations manage lots of projects at the same time. Sometimes, 
a project is the only project of its type in a company, such as organizing an 
office move. Others, such as a building design project in an architectural 
firm, happen simultaneously with several other, similar projects and draw on 
many of the same resources, such as architects and draftspeople.
When an organization engages in projects of a similar nature at the same 
time, drawing from a centralized resource pool can save them time because 
they don’t have to create resources that already exist. Tracking resources 
across projects can also be helpful.
You can use another time-saving Project feature to pull existing resources 
from a company address book or from your own Address Book in Outlook.
Skimming from resource pools
If you use Project throughout your company, you may have a resource pool, 
a centralized repository of common resources that allows project managers 
to assign those resources to their various projects. By using a resource pool, 
you can form a more realistic idea of how busy resources are across all proj­
ects at any time.
	
Don’t confuse resource pools with enterprise resources, which require that 
you set up Project Professional, Project Server, and Microsoft Office Project 
Web App. A resource pool is simply a Project file that contains only a list of 
resources in Resource Sheet view and is saved on a shared network drive 
for your workgroup or on your company server. Anyone with access to the 
resource pool file can assign the resources it contains to projects. A resource 
pool saves everybody the trouble of having to repeatedly create these 
resources in their individual projects.
To access a resource that’s available to your entire organization, follow this 
procedure:
	
1.	Open the resource pool file and then open the file that will be the 
sharer file.
	
	 See the earlier sidebar “Creating sharer files” for information about the 
resource pool and sharer file.
	
2.	Working in the sharer file, choose Resource➪Resource Pool➪Share 
Resources.
	
	 The Share Resources dialog box appears.

119
 Chapter 7: Creating Resources
	
3.	Specify the resources for the project.
	
	 If you want to specify that a project will use only its own resources (the 
default setting), select the Use Own Resources option. If you want to 
share resources, select the Use Resources option and then choose a 
project from the From list.
	
4.	Specify what Project should do when a conflicting resource setting, 
such as the resource base calendar, exists.
	
	 If your project’s setting will take precedence, select the Sharer Takes 
Precedence option. If you want the pool setting to rule, select Pool 
Takes Precedence.
	
5.	Click the OK button to complete the process.
	
	 All resources in the specified resource pool are added to your own proj­
ect’s resource list, ready to be assigned to tasks.
After you add a shared resource to your project, you can update shared 
resource information, in case the person who maintains those shared resources 
has made a change, such as increasing the resource’s rate per hour. To do this, 
choose Resource➪Resource Sharing➪Refresh Resource Pool.
	
If you combine separate projects into one master project at any point, Project 
allows you to have duplicated resources. If you link the combined projects 
and then delete a duplicate resource in the master project, it’s deleted in the 
subproject as well. A better practice is to have all the separate projects share 
resources from a resource pool so that no duplicate resources exist when you 
create the master project file.
Importing resources from Outlook
Project allows you to save yourself the time spent entering resource informa­
tion by allowing you to pull resources from Outlook.
	
To pull resources from Outlook, you must have it specified as your default 
e-mail program: Open Outlook, and when you’re asked whether you want it to 
be your default program, say yes.
When you insert one or more Outlook resources into your project, they’re 
added to your project list, using the resource name and e-mail address as 
they exist in the Outlook Address Book. The default first-letter initial and 
work type are also preassigned. You can then add to the resource any details 
you like.

120
Part II: Managing Resources 
To insert resources from your Outlook Address Book, display Resource Sheet 
view and follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Resource➪Add Resources➪Address Book.
	
	 The Select Resources dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the name of a resource in the Name list.
	
3.	Click Add to place the selected name in the Resources list.
	
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to add to your project all the resource names you 
want to import.
	
5.	When you’re finished, click the OK button.
The names now appear in the project resource list, ready for you to assign 
them to tasks.
Drowning in the resource pool
Drawing resources from resource pools saves 
you time because you don’t have to repeat­
edly re-create those resources. However, you 
may wonder whether you should track your 
resource’s time in the resource pool file to see 
whether the resource is overbooked. Most 
projects in the real world use resources that 
aren’t solely dedicated to a single project. New 
users of Project are often confused because 
almost every person working on their proj­
ects spends time on other work, from general 
communication with coworkers and clients to 
efforts invested in other projects. Should these 
beginners build resource pools to account 
for time shared among several projects at 
one time?
Generally speaking, trying to track every minute 
of every resource’s day to see whether resources 
are working 100 percent or 50 percent on your 
tasks or are being shared among multiple proj­
ects amounts to chaos. Ask yourself this question: 
When this resource works on a task in your proj­
ect, will he put his entire focus on that task at that 
time? If so, you may not need to fool around with 
tracking shared resources across many projects. 
Especially on shorter tasks, resisting the urge to 
micromanage the efforts of your resources out­
side your own project usually works well. If, on the 
other hand, you have resources working only half 
the time or splitting time between two projects 
routinely, consider using shared resource tools 
to keep track of those resources across projects.

ost people live their lives based on responding to their clocks and 
calendars. Think about it: You wake up, and your first thoughts are 
about what day it is, what time it is, and whether it’s a workday.
You have a typical workday, whether you’re a 9-to-5 person or your particular 
job calls for you to work from midnight to 8 a.m. You probably also vary from 
that routine now and then, when you complete a 12-hour marathon session in a 
crunch or slip away after half a day to go fishing on a nice summer day.
In a way, Project 2013 calendars resemble your work life: They set standards 
for a typical working time and then allow for variation. Unlike you, however, 
Project 2013 has several types of calendars to account for.

122
Part II: Managing Resources 
Mastering Base, Project, Resource, 
and Task Calendars
One piece of information to consider when assigning resources is when people 
can work. You adjust resource working time in calendars. As I describe in 
Chapter 2, when you first open a new project, you enter information about 
the project either in the Project Information dialog box or in the File Tab in 
the Project Information section. One option under project information is the 
Project Calendar.
You have three calendar options:
	
✓	The Standard (default) calendar shows a typical 9-to-5 workday and a 
5-day workweek, with no exceptions such as holidays. You can think of 
it as the company calendar, which reflects its operating hours (when the 
“doors are open”).
	
✓	Night Shift shows an 8-hour workday, scheduled between 11 p.m. and 
8 a.m., with an hour off for a meal, from Monday through Friday — no 
exceptions. You can select this calendar for resources who work the 
same company days but different hours,
	
✓	The 24 Hours base calendar shows continuous time, 24 hours per day 
and 7 days per week.
Project 2013 has four calendar types: base, project, resource, and task. 
Mastering the calendar types can be tricky, but understanding how calen­
dars work is essential to mastering the software. Tasks are scheduled and 
resources are assigned based on the calendar settings you make.
You can manage calendars in a project in one of three ways: Use a project 
calendar that sets the working dates and times for all resources and tasks, 
modify calendars for specific resources, or assign and modify calendars for 
specific tasks.
	
Don’t become confused by my use of the term project as it refers to the soft­
ware, the project calendar type, and your project. I use Project 2013 to indicate 
the software itself, project calendar to specify the calendar type, and plain proj­
ect to refer to your project.
How calendars work
Not everyone in a company works the same schedule, and not every task can 
be performed in the same eight-hour workday. To deal with the variations 

123
 Chapter 8: Working with Calendars
in schedules that occur in most workplaces, Project 2013 offers various cal­
endar settings. Here’s the lowdown on the role of each of the four calendar 
types in Project 2013 (the next section details how they interact):
	
✓	Base: The template on which all other calendars are built. Three base 
calendars are available: Standard, Night Shift, and 24 Hours. (You can 
read more about them later in this chapter, in the section “Working with 
Task Calendars and Resource Calendars.”)
	
✓	Project: The default calendar for scheduling. You choose which base 
calendar template your particular project should use.
	
✓	Resource: Combines the base calendar settings with any exceptions 
(nonworking times, such as vacation time) that you set for a particular 
resource.
	
✓	Task: Provides a spot where you can set exceptions for a particular task.
When you create tasks and assign resources to work on them, Project 2013 
has to base that work on a timing standard. For example, if you say that a 
task should be completed in one workday, Project 2013 knows that a workday 
means 8 hours (or 12 hours or whatever) because that’s how you set up a 
standard workday in the project calendar. Likewise, suppose that you assign 
a resource to work two weeks on a task in a company that uses a standard 
five-day workweek. If that resource’s own calendar is set for a standard four-
day workweek, the two weeks of work by that resource defer to the timing of 
the resource calendar for a total of only eight workdays.
	
The nature of a task can affect resource time. A two-week, effort-driven task 
isn’t complete until its resources have invested two weeks (according to 
the project calendar or task calendar) of effort. You can find out more about 
effort-driven tasks in Chapter 5.
How one calendar relates to another
All calendars in a project are controlled, by default, by the project calendar 
setting. Here’s the tricky part, though: When you change a task calendar or 
resource calendar (known as an exception), you have to understand which 
setting takes precedence.
Here’s how the precedence concept works:
	
✓	With no other settings made, the base calendar template you select for 
the project calendar when you first create the project controls the work­
ing times and days of all tasks and resources.

124
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
✓	If you make changes in the working hours for a resource, those settings 
take precedence over the project calendar for that resource when you 
assign it to a task. Likewise, if you assign a different base calendar for a 
task, that calendar takes precedence over the project calendar for that task.
	
✓	If you apply one calendar to a resource and a different calendar to a task 
that the resource is assigned to, Project 2013 uses only common hours 
to schedule the resource. For example, if the task calendar allows work 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the resource calendar allows work from 6 a.m. 
to 2 p.m., the resource works from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., which is the only 
period the calendars have in common.
	
✓	You can set a task to ignore resource calendar settings by opening the 
Task Information dialog box (double-click the task name in Gantt Chart 
view) and selecting the Scheduling Ignores Resource Calendars check 
box on the Advanced tab. (This setting isn’t available if the task cal­
endar is set to None.) You might make this setting if you know that all 
resources are required to be involved in a task (such as a quarterly 
company meeting), regardless of their usual work hours.
Scheduling with Calendar Options 
and Working Times
In this section, I throw two more timing elements at you: calendar options 
and working times.
Calendar options are used to change the standard settings for a working day, 
week, and year. You can set a project calendar to Standard, for example. By 
default, that’s 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days a week.
Working time is used to adjust the time available for work on a particular date 
or days. Suppose that you make a change to the calendar options so that you 
have 8-hour days and 32-hour workweeks. Also check your working time to 
ensure that you specify 3 nonworking days of the 7-day week, to jibe with 
the 32-hour week. If you want to set a certain date as nonworking for your 
project, such as the company offsite meeting day, you can do that using the 
working-time settings.
	
To ensure that the project is scheduled accurately from the get-go, make all 
changes to calendar options and working times before you add tasks to the 
project.
	
You have to change the calendar options and calendar settings for every new 
project file you create. However, you can set up a calendar that can be used 
for all your projects and shared in a single global location, as explained later 
in this chapter, in the section “Sharing Copies of Calendars.”

125
 Chapter 8: Working with Calendars
Setting calendar options
When you make changes to a resource calendar or task calendar, you simply 
adjust the times that a resource is available to work or the time during which 
a task occurs; you don’t change the length of a typical workday for the proj­
ect. A day is still 8 hours long if that’s the project calendar setting, even if 
you say that a task that takes place on that day uses the 24-hour base calen­
dar template.
To change the length of a typical workday to ten hours rather than eight, for 
example, you must do so on the Calendar tab of the Options dialog box.
Follow these steps to modify the calendar options:
	
1.	Select the File tab on the Ribbon and click the Options button.
	
	 The Project Options dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Schedule category on the left side of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 8-1.
	
3.	From the Week Starts On drop-down list, choose a day.
	
4.	To modify the start of the fiscal year, select a month from the Fiscal 
Year Starts In drop-down list.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Define the 
typical 
working 
day, week, 
month, and 
year.
	

126
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
5.	To change the working hours in a typical day, type new times in the 
Default Start Time and Default End Time fields.
	
	If you change the default start or end time setting, change the corre­
sponding working time also, as described in the following section.
	
6.	Modify the Hours Per Day, Hours Per Week, and Days Per Month 
fields as needed.
	
7.	Click the OK button to save these settings.
	
Worrying about every calculated hour can be tedious. Most professional 
schedulers avoid changing the default calendar settings. Unless you truly want 
to track the scheduling of tasks to the hour, simply manage tasks to the day or 
week and keep track of scheduled deliverables in this manner.
Setting exceptions to working times
To change the available working hours for a particular day (such as 
December 24), you use the working-time settings. For example, if the day 
before Christmas is half a workday, you can modify the working-time settings 
for that day; then any resources assigned to a task on this date spend only 
half a day working. You also use these settings to specify global working and 
nonworking days to match the calendar options settings.
Here’s how to change working times:
	
1.	Choose Project➪Change Working Time.
	
	 The Change Working Time dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-2.
	
2.	On the calendar, click the day you want to change.
	
3.	Click the Exceptions tab to display it; then click the Name cell in a 
blank row, type a name for the exception, and press Enter.
	
4.	Click the exception name you entered in Step 3 and then click the 
Details button.
	
	 The Details dialog box for this exception opens, as shown in Figure 8-3. 
This example shows Thanksgiving Eve with the workday ending at 2 p.m.
	
5.	Select either the Nonworking or Working Times radio button.
	
6.	Enter a time range in the From and To fields.
	
	To set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to build in a lunch break), 
you have to insert two or more sets of numbers (such as 8 to 12 and 
1 to 5) in the From and To fields.

7.	Select a recurrence pattern and then set an interval in the Recur 
Every x Time Period field.
	
	 For example, if you select Weekly and click the arrows to set the interval 
field to 3, this pattern recurs every three weeks.
	
8.	Set the range of recurrence.
	
	 Either enter Start and End By dates or select the End After radio button 
and set the number of occurrences there.
	
9.	Click the OK button twice to close the dialog boxes and save your 
changes.
Working with Task Calendars 
and Resource Calendars
You can set a task calendar to use a different base calendar template from 
the one you selected for the project calendar. Doing so takes precedence 
over the project calendar for that task. Suppose that you select the Standard 
calendar template for a project and a 24 Hours task calendar template. If 
you then specify that the task has a duration of one day, it’s one 24-hour day 
(assuming that the assigned resources also use a calendar allowing for a 
24-hour schedule, such as machinery).
To modify the settings for a task calendar, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click the task name.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Advanced tab.
	
3.	From the Calendar drop-down list, choose a different base calendar.
	
4.	Click the OK button to save the new calendar setting.
	
If a resource assigned to a task has a modified calendar, the resource works 
only during the specific hours that the task calendar and resource calendar 
have in common.
Setting resource calendars
Only work resources have their own calendars. That’s because material 
resources are charged not by time worked but by units used, and a cost 
resource is assigned a set cost that doesn’t relate to any time worked on 
a task.

129
 Chapter 8: Working with Calendars
Even the most resourceful resources have only so many hours in a day to 
work. When you have to deal with variations in resource schedules, consider 
modifying the resource calendars.
You can change the base calendar template for each work resource and set 
specific dates as working or nonworking. These exceptions take precedence 
over the project and task calendars, and control when a specific resource can 
work.
	
Unless a resource has a truly unique working schedule, don’t change its base 
calendar template. For example, if a resource usually works a day shift but 
works a night shift for only a few days during the life of the project, don’t change 
that resource’s base calendar template to Night Shift. If one person works 
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. because the company allows him to, you probably don’t 
have to vary his schedule from the typical 8-to-5 work schedule that’s set in 
the project calendar, because he works eight hours a day, like everyone else 
does. Unless your project deals with the most detailed level of time, where 
hours and not days are the typical units of measure for tasks, making these 
types of changes is more work than it’s worth.
Making the change to a 
resource’s calendar
To modify a resource’s calendar settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display a view that includes a resource column, such as the Resource 
Sheet view.
	
	 Simply select the view from the drop-down list that appears when 
you click the bottom of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the 
Ribbon. Chapter 6 covers how to display different views.
	
2.	Double-click a resource name.
	
	 The Resource Information dialog box appears.
	
3.	Click the Change Working Time button on the General tab to display 
the Change Working Time dialog box.
	
	The Exceptions and Work Weeks tabs have settings that are identical to 
the ones in the Change Working Time dialog box for tasks, but changes 
made here affect this resource rather than the task.
	
4.	In the Click on a Day to See Its Working Times calendar section, click 
the day that you want to change.

130
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
5.	Click the Work Weeks tab to display it; then click a blank row, enter a 
name for the exception, and press Enter.
	
	If you want to edit the default work week for all weeks of the year, leave 
[Default] selected instead. If you want to mark a single holiday, use the 
Exceptions tab instead.
	
6.	Click the exception you just created, and click the Details button.
	
	 The Details dialog box for this exception appears.
	
7.	Select the day or days to modify in the Select Day(s) list on the left 
side.
	
	 You can click the first day and then Shift+click to select a range of adja­
cent days, or Ctrl+click to select nonadjacent days.
	
8.	To set working times for these exceptions, select either the 
Nonworking or Working ratio button.
	
9.	If you chose the latter option in Step 8, enter a time range in the From 
and To fields.
	
	To delete a row in the From and To area, click the row number and 
press Delete.
	
	To set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to build in a lunch break), 
put two or more sets of numbers (such as 8 to 12 and 1 to 5) in the start 
and finish columns.
	
10.	Set the range of recurrence.
	
	 Set the start date of the occurrence, select the End After radio button, 
and enter the number of occurrences, or select End By instead and enter 
the end date of the recurrence.
	
	 Figure 8-4 shows how a resource’s vacation is shown in the Change 
Working Time dialog box.
	
11.	Click the OK button to close the Change Working Time dialog box and 
save these changes.
	
Micromanaging nonworking time for your resources can leave you no time to 
do anything else, so avoid this urge. For example, if someone takes off half a 
day for a doctor’s appointment, don’t block off a day. However, if a resource 
takes a two-week vacation or a three-month sabbatical, you should probably 
modify that resource’s calendar.
	
Resources can work overtime even if their calendars say that they’re 9-to-5ers, 
though you have to tell Project 2013 to schedule overtime work. You can also 
set a different rate to be charged for overtime work for that resource. To find 
out more about overtime, see Chapter 10.

 Chapter 8: Working with Calendars

An excep-
tion for a

Creating a Custom Calendar Template
Although the three Project 2013 base calendar templates cover most work­
ing situations, you might want to create your own calendar template. For 
example, if the project involves a telemarketing initiative and most project 
resources work six hours, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. (that’s when they all call me 
anyway!), consider creating a new calendar template named Telemarketing. 
Another reason to create a custom template is that the three Project 2013 
calendars have no holidays specified. You may need to ensure, at minimum, 
that company holidays are indicated in the calendar you use to ensure that 
Project 2013 accurately schedules around those dates.
If you want to save some time when creating a template, start with an existing 
base calendar template that most closely fits your needs. Then modify it as 
you like by making changes to the working times and calendar options (see 
the section “Scheduling with Calendar Options and Working Times,” earlier 
in this chapter) to ensure that they’re in agreement. After you create a new 
calendar template, it’s available for you to apply in all three calendar types: 
project, task, and resource.

132
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
Because the project calendar is the basis of the entire project, it should repre­
sent the most common working schedule in the project. If only certain 
resources in the project work odd hours, change the resource calendars and 
not the project calendar.
Follow these steps to create a new calendar template:
	
1.	Choose Project➪Change Working Time.
	
	 The Change Working Time dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Create New Calendar button.
	
	 The Create New Base Calendar dialog box appears.
	
3.	In the Name box, type a unique name for the new calendar.
	
4.	Select either the Create New Base Calendar or the Make a Copy of x 
Calendar radio button; then select an existing base calendar from the 
list on which to base the calendar template.
	
	 If you choose Create New Base Calendar, Project 2013 creates a copy 
of the Standard calendar with a new name. If you choose Make a Copy 
Of and select 24 Hours or Night Shift, the new calendar is based on that 
choice. Whichever you choose, it’s your starting point, and you can 
make changes to make the calendar unique after making this choice.
	
5.	Click the OK button to return to the Change Working Time dialog box.
	
	 Now make changes to the working time for the new calendar template.
	
6.	Click the OK button to save the new calendar settings.
	
If you haven’t already done so, change the calendar options to match the 
working times of the custom calendar you created. You can do this from the 
Change Working Time dialog box, using its Options button.
Sharing Copies of Calendars
You can make a calendar available for multiple projects by using the 
Organizer; it serves as the control center for custom items such as calendars 
you create in your project files. Using the Organizer, you can copy a custom 
calendar from one project file into another. Or you can copy a custom calen­
dar into a template that provides default settings to every new, blank project 
file you create.

133
 Chapter 8: Working with Calendars
To copy a calendar from one project to another, follow this procedure:
	
1.	Open the project to which you want to copy a calendar and the project 
file that holds the custom calendar to copy.
	
2.	Choose File➪Info.
	
	Backstage view opens.
	
3.	Click the Organizer button.
	
	 The Organizer dialog box appears.
	
4.	Click the Calendars tab.
	
5.	From the Calendars Available In drop-down list (in the lower-left 
corner), select the Project 2013 file that contains the calendar you 
want to copy.
	
6.	In the Calendars Available In drop-down list (in the lower-right 
corner), choose whether you want to make the calendar available in 
another open project (by selecting that project) or the Global template 
(by selecting Global.MPT).
	
7.	In the list on the left, click the calendar you want to copy and then 
click the Copy button, as shown in Figure 8-5.
	
	 The calendar is copied to the current project.
	
Figure 8-5: 
Copying a 
calendar to 
other 
projects.
	
	
8.	If you want to give the calendar a different name, make sure that it’s 
selected in the list, click the Rename button, type a new name in the 
Rename dialog box that appears, and then click the OK button.
	
9.	Close the Organizer by clicking the X (Close) button in the upper-right 
corner.

134
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
Follow these pointers to copy calendars from project to project:
	
✓	Give the calendar a descriptive name. Providing an appropriate name 
helps you remember the calendar’s general parameters.
	
✓	If your company has standard calendars, have a single resource create 
and disseminate them. If ten versions of a management calendar float 
around and you grab the wrong one, it can cause problems.
	
✓	Add the project manager’s initials to every calendar template name 
you create. That way, you know which ones you created.

Chapter 9
Assigning Resources
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying the right resource
▶	Making resource assignments
▶	Checking resource availability
▶	Using Team Planner view
A

fter you enter tasks and resources, you start assigning tasks to 
resources. That is when the fun begins! The duration of some tasks may 
change, and you may start to see evidence of people who are overbooked on 
several tasks that happen around the same time. Understanding how these 
results occur is the key to making intelligent assignments and balancing the 
project scope with your milestone obligations and resource availability.
In fact, assigning resources, balancing scope, schedule and cost, and replan­
ning is an ongoing process throughout a project. As usual, Project provides 
the tools to help you manage the resource assignment process so you can 
arrive at an optimal solution.
Finding the Right Resource
Sometimes, no one in the world can perform a certain task like Albert does, 
and you’ll persuade Albert to do that job if it kills you. At other times, almost 
anyone can handle the work.
If any Tom, Dick, or Mary with a certain skill level (or a certain rate per hour) 
can do the job, you can use Project 2013 features to find the right resource 
and ensure that she has enough time to take on “just one more” task.

136
Part II: Managing Resources 
Needed: One good resource willing to work
You’ve probably used the Find feature in other software to find a word or 
phrase or number. That’s child’s play compared with Project’s Find feature, 
which can find you a backhoe, a corporate jet, or even a person! You can use 
Project’s Find feature to look for resources with certain rates or in a certain 
workgroup. You can search for resources by their initials, their maximum 
assignment units, or their standard or overtime rate, for example.
Suppose that you need to find a resource whose standard rate is less than 
$50 per hour. Or you want to find someone who can spend extra time working 
on a task, so you search for any resource whose maximum units are greater 
than 100 percent. (In other words, the resource can work a longer-than-usual 
day before she is considered overallocated.) Perhaps you need to find a mate­
rial resource that is a chemical measured in gallons, but you can’t remember 
its exact name. In this case, you can search for resources whose material 
label includes the word gallons.
	
To find resource information, you must be working in a resource-oriented 
view. To find task information, you must be working in the task-oriented view.
First, display any resource view and then follow these steps to find resources 
in Project:
	
1.	On the Task tab, click Find in the Editing group.
	
	 The Find dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-1.
	
Figure 9-1: 
Using the 
Find feature.
	
	
2.	In the Find What box, type the text you want to find.
	
	 For example, type 75 if you want to search for a resource with a stan­
dard rate of $75 per hour or less, or type water if you want to find a 
resource whose material label contains that word.
	
3.	From the Look in Field list, choose the name of the field in which you 
want to search.

137
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources
	
	 For example, to search for resources that have a maximum unit-assignment 
percentage of more than 100 percent, choose the Max Units field. Or choose 
Standard Rate to search based on the resource’s hourly rate.
	
4.	In the Test box, select a criterion.
	
	 For maximum units of more than 100 percent, for example, Is Greater 
Than is the best choice. For a rate less than $75 per hour, it’s Is Less Than.
	
5.	If you prefer to search backward from the current location (that is, the 
selected cell in the task list) instead of forward, choose Up from the 
Search box.
	
6.	If you want to match the case of the text, select the Match Case 
check box.
	
7.	To begin the search, click the Find Next button.
	
8.	Continue to click Find Next until you find the instance you’re 
looking for.
Custom fields: It’s a skill
When assigning resources, you often need to consider a person’s skills. If a 
person with less skill or experience could work on a particular task (and save 
you money because she charges a lower rate per hour), wouldn’t it be nice to 
be able to find these resources easily?
Well, Project doesn’t include a Skill field, but it does allow you to add fields 
of your own. You can use these fields for anything, but one useful way is to 
code resources by skill level. You can use a rating system such as A, B, and C 
or use terms such as Exp for an experienced worker and Beg for a beginning-
level worker.
Here’s how to add a custom field:
	
1.	Display the Resource Sheet (or whatever sheet in which you want to 
view the custom field).
	
2.	Scroll to the right and click the Add New Column column heading.
	
3.	Type a name for the field and press Enter.
You can enter whatever you like in this column for each resource in the 
project. Then you can search for specific entries in that field using the Find 
feature or turn on a filter to display only resources with a certain skill level in 
that field. (Read more about filters in Chapter 11.)

138
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
The custom field that’s created using this method uses one of the placeholder 
fields Text 1 through Text 30 that’s available for you to customize. You can 
customize other types of placeholder fields, such as cost fields or flag fields. 
To access more custom fields, right-click a field column heading and click 
Custom Fields.
	
Some organizations designate custom fields for certain company information, 
such as an accounting code or a vendor rating. If a Project administrator is in 
charge of these enterprise-wide standards, check with her before you choose 
a custom field to designate skill level.
Making a Useful Assignation
In a project where entering tasks isn’t complex, defining the relationship, 
assigning a resource, and entering the duration is sufficient for developing a 
working schedule. But when you work in an organization that has many proj­
ects competing for limited resources and those projects are complex in nature, 
you’re better served using software to help you manage its complexities.
Alas, the more complex the environment, the more variables that affect the 
schedule. For example, you can’t simply enter a series of tasks; you need 
to determine the type of task (such as fixed units, fixed work, or fixed dura­
tion) and determine whether the task is effort driven. The task type affects 
the duration of the task after you assign resources. I describe task types in 
Chapter 5.
When you assign resources, pay attention to the resource type (work, mate­
rial, or cost) and the resource availability. In addition, consider whether 
the project calendar, task calendar, and resource calendars affect the tasks 
assigned to resources. You can use a couple of methods to assign resources 
to tasks and also specify the resource assignment units. These assignment 
units differ slightly between work resources and material and cost resources, 
as explained in the next several sections.
Determining material and 
cost-resource units
Work resources, which are typically people, are assigned to a task using a 
percentage: for example, 50 percent, 100 percent, or 150 percent. When you 
assign a resource at a percentage, the assignment is based on the resource 

139
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources
calendar. A resource with a Standard calendar spends eight hours a day 
working if you assign it at 100 percent assignment units.
A material resource is assigned in units, such as gallons, consulting sessions, 
yards, or tons. When you assign a material resource to a task, you designate 
how many units of that resource are devoted to that task. Project doesn’t act 
like job-costing software, deleting units from an inventory; it isn’t affected by 
how many units are used against the total available. (You can’t use it in this 
manner.)
A cost resource is one that incurs a variable cost every time you assign it. For 
example, if you create the Permit Fee cost resource, every time you assign a 
permit fee to a task, you can designate the actual cost for that assignment, 
whether it’s $25 or $125.
Making assignments
You have three main ways to assign resources in Project (although you can 
use other methods while working in various views):
	
✓	Select resources from the Resources tab of the Task Information 
dialog box.
	
✓	Enter resource information in the Resource column in the Entry table 
(displayed in Gantt Chart view).
	
✓	Use the Assign Resources dialog box.
Regardless of which method you use, you work in a task-based view, such as 
Gantt Chart view, to make the assignments.
Which method you use depends to some extent on your own preferences. 
Follow these guidelines:
	
✓	Resource column: By default, you assign resources at 100 percent 
availability. If you want to assign a different percentage, don’t use this 
method; it’s more difficult if you need to assign multiple resources.
	
✓	Assign Resources dialog box: Replace one resource with another (using 
the handy Replace feature) or filter the list of available resources by 
a criterion (for example, resources with a cost of less than a specified 
amount). This method is useful for assigning multiple resources.
	
✓	Task Information dialog box: Having the task details handy (such as 
task type or the constraints contained on other tabs of this dialog box) 
is helpful when you make the assignment.

140
Part II: Managing Resources 
Selecting resources from the Resource column
You can add resources from the Resource column, whether it’s from Gantt 
Chart view or Tracking Gantt view.
	
Even though Task Usage view lists tasks in its sheet pane and can even display 
a Resource column, this view can’t be used to add resource assignments.
Follow these steps to assign resources at a default percentage:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view by clicking the Gantt Chart button on the 
Task tab or View tab of the Ribbon.
	
2.	Choose View➪Tables➪Entry.
	
3.	Click in the Resource Names column for the task on which you want to 
make a resource assignment.
	
	 An arrow appears at the end of the cell.
	
4.	Click the arrow to display a list of resources.
	
5.	Click the resource you want to assign.
	
	 The resource name appears in the Resource column, assigned at 
100 percent.
	
You can always change the assignment units later by opening the Task 
Information dialog box and changing the assignment units on the 
Resources tab.
Using the Assign Resources dialog box
To assign a work resource or material resource to a task, you can select a 
task and then use the Assign Resources dialog box to make assignments. This 
unique dialog box is the only one you can leave open and continue to scroll 
within the project, making it easy to switch between selecting a task and 
making an assignment. This method is easy to use for assigning material and 
cost resources. To use the Assign Resources dialog box, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Assign Resources button in the Assignments group of the 
Resource tab on the Ribbon.
	
	 The Assign Resources dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
	
2.	Click a task to select it.
	
	 The Assign Resources dialog box can remain open while you select tasks 
in the task list. Then you can make assignments to a variety of tasks 
without the need to close and reopen the dialog box repeatedly.

141
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources
	
Figure 9-2: 
Resource 
list for the 
project.
	
	
3.	Click the Units column for the work or material resource you want to 
assign or the Cost column for the cost resource you want to assign, 
and then specify the assignment units or cost for the resource.
	
	 Click the spinner arrows in the box to increase or decrease the set­
ting. If you don’t select units for a work resource, Project assumes that 
you’re assigning 100 percent of the resource. The spinner arrows show 
5 percent increments, or you can simply type a percentage. For a mate­
rial resource, use the spinner arrows in the Units column to increase 
or decrease the unit assignment, or type a number of units. For a cost 
resource, type the expected cost for that particular assignment.
	
4.	Click the Assign button.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to add all resources.
	
6.	If you want to replace one resource with another, click an assigned 
resource (indicated with a check mark), click the Replace button, 
select another name on the list, set its units, and click OK.
	
7.	Click the Close button to save all the assignments.
Adding assignments in the Task Information dialog box
You can assign resources on the Resources tab of any Task Information 
dialog box by following these steps:
	
1.	Double-click a task name in Gantt Chart view.
	
	 The Task Information dialog box appears.
	
2.	Click the Resources tab to display it.
	
3.	Click in a blank Resource Name box and then click the arrow that 
appears on the right side of the box.
	
	 A drop-down list of resources appears.

142
Part II: Managing Resources 
	
4.	Click the resource you want to assign.
	
5.	For a work or material resource, click the Units column and use the 
spinner arrows to set an assignment percentage; for a cost resource, 
click the Cost column and enter the cost.
	
	 If you’re assigning a material resource, the Units default setting is a single 
unit. (If your units are pounds, the default assignment is 1 lb.) Use the 
spinner arrows in the Unit field or type a value there to assign additional 
material units.
	
6.	Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to assign additional resources.
	
7.	Click the OK button.
Shaping the contour that’s right for you
When you make a work resource assignment, Project spreads out the work 
evenly over the life of the task. However, you can modify the level of work 
that takes place during the life of an autoscheduled task — its work contour — 
so that more work takes place near the beginning, middle, or end of the task.
For example, if you know that the employees on a task to install a new com­
puter network will have to spend some time up front studying the manuals 
and reviewing the schematics for the wiring before they can begin to make 
measurable progress on the installation, you may use a late-peaking contour. 
Or if you know that employees are likely to put in a lot of work up front on 
a survey — and then sit back and wait for the results to come in — you may 
choose an early-peaking contour.
Using a different contour on a particular resource’s task assignment can free 
that resource to work on a second task that occurs during the life of the first 
task. This strategy can help you resolve a resource conflict.
	
The contour you select will have slightly different effects, depending on the task 
type. Trust me: Most project managers don’t even want to try to understand 
this complex equation. Simply try a different contour to see whether it solves 
your problem and doesn’t make too dramatic a change to the task duration or 
another resource assignment. Realize that most all the applied work contours 
result in a greater task duration.
To set a task’s contour, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Task Usage view.
	
	 This view shows resource assignments by task.

143
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources
	
2.	Double-click a resource assignment.
	
	 The Assignment Information dialog box appears.
	
3.	From the Work Contour drop-down menu, choose a preset pattern.
	
4.	Click the OK button to save the setting.
	
	 A symbol for the contour pattern is displayed in the Indicator column 
for the resource, as shown in Figure 9-3.
	
	 If none of these patterns fits your situation, you can manually modify a 
resource’s work by changing the number of hours the resource puts in 
day by day on a task in Task Usage view.
Before you save, ensure that your modifications equal the number of hours 
you want, or else you can inadvertently change the resource’s assignment.
	
Resource Usage view is useful for reviewing resource hours across a timeline 
at this stage of planning. This view gives a side-by-side comparison between 
a single resource’s workload and all the tasks taking place during a particular 
period in the project.

Part II: Managing Resources
Benefitting from a Helpful Planner
One thing you may notice after making resource assignments is that a little 
Person icon appears as an indicator beside certain tasks in Gantt Chart view. 
If you switch to a resource-oriented view, you may see that certain resource 
names now display in red. These changes are Project’s way of indicating 
resources in danger of being overbooked in the plan.
Team Planner view you can help ensure that you’ve distributed work among 
resources in a manageable way. To change to Team Planner view, click the 
bottom half of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the Ribbon and then 
click Team Planner. Or, if you’re working on the Resource tab, click the Team 
Planner button on the far left side. This view enables you to move assignments 
among resources, assign tasks that haven’t been assigned, and even schedule 
tasks that haven’t been scheduled. Figure 9-4 shows Team Planner view.
When two or more tasks assigned to a resource overlap and cause the resource 
to be overbooked (or overallocated), thin red bars appear above and below 
the overbooked period. Team Planner view also shows you any tasks that are 
unassigned or lack enough schedule information to be scheduled.	
Figure 9-4: 
Team 
Planner 
view.	

145
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources
To view unassigned tasks, drag the bar at the bottom that shows the number 
of unassigned tasks up, dropping it to split the view the way you want.
From there, you can drag and drop to correct a number of schedule issues, 
and you can use the following techniques in any combination:
	
✓	To fix a resource overallocation: Drag an overlapping task to the left or 
right to change its schedule. If you want to reassign the task to another 
resource, drag the task up or down to that resource.
	
✓	To assign an unassigned task: Drag the task up to the row for the 
resource to which you want to assign the task.
	
✓	To schedule an unscheduled task: Drag the task to the right, to the 
timescale portion of the view, and then drop the task into a schedule 
position.
	
Team Planner view is only one tool you can use to handle overbooked 
resources. Chapter 12 presents even more methods for fixing workload issues.
	
Dragging horizontally in Team Planner view changes the task schedule, 
whereas dragging vertically from one resource to another changes the task 
assignment.
After you have a workable version of the project schedule, ensure that your 
resources agree to their assignments. You can send the entire project plan 
to resources as an e-mail attachment or sync it with SharePoint.

T

here’s no such thing as a free lunch — and if you use Project to track 
costs, there’s no such thing as a free resource, because Project uses 
resources working on tasks as a way of calculating most of the costs of the 
project.
When you set up a resource, you specify a work resource rate (by default, this 
rate is calculated by hour) or a material resource per use cost. You can also 
create cost resources — a variable cost that isn’t calculated using a per-use 
or hourly rate but that may be used several times in a project, such as travel 
expenses. For example, if you assign a resource to work ten hours on a task, 
give that resource an hourly rate of $20, and you’ve added a $200 cost to the 
project. Create a resource named cement, give it a unit cost of $200, and assign 
ten units (for example, ten tons of cement), and you’ve added a whopping 
$2,000 to the bottom line.
Some other factors come into play as well, such as how many hours a day a 
resource is available to work and any overtime rates. At the end of the day, 
all these settings come together to comprise the project cost.
This chapter helps you explore the relationship between resources and costs, 
and shows you how to set resource standard and overtime rates and create 
fixed costs.

148
Part II: Managing Resources 
Mary, Mary, How Do Your Costs Accrue?
Project helps to account for costs on various tasks with a combination of 
costs per hour, costs per use, costs per unit, fixed costs, and costs for specific 
assignments of cost resources. Before you begin to flesh out cost information 
about resources, you have to understand how these calculations work.
Project provides two main pictures of the budget in a project: one at the 
moment you freeze the original plan (a baseline plan) and the ongoing picture 
of actual costs that comes from the activity and material usage you record as 
the project moves along. You record a certain amount of work effort on tasks, 
and tasks with resources assigned to them then run up costs based on the 
effort expended or units of materials used.
Adding up the costs
The best way to understand how costs add up in the project is to look at an 
example. John Smith (not his real name) is managing a project that involves 
the building of a new gourmet ice cream packaging plant. Here are the costs 
that John anticipates for the task he has created, Install Ice-Cream Mixers:
	
✓	About ten person-hours of effort to complete the installation
	
✓	A cost per use of $500 paid to the mixer manufacturer to oversee the 
installation and to train workers to use the machine
	
✓	Twenty pounds of ice cream ingredients to test the mixers
	
✓	Shipping expenses of $150 for the mixers and supplies
	
✓	A fixed cost of $2,500 for the mixers themselves
The ten hours of effort will be expended by work resources. The total cost 
for the ten hours is a calculation: 10 × the resource rate. If the resource rate 
is $20, this cost totals $200. If two resources work on the task, one at a rate of 
$20 and one at a rate of $30, then (with effort-driven scheduling turned off by 
default) Project adds 20 hours of effort between them, and the resulting cost 
is $500.
The cost per use of $500 is a fee to the manufacturer, which is also created as 
a work resource. This cost doesn’t change based on the number of resources 
or the time involved.
The cost of 20 pounds of ice cream (any flavor you like) is calculated as 20 × 
the unit cost of the ice cream ingredients. If the unit cost is $2, this cost is $40.

149
 Chapter 10: Determining a Project’s Cost
Shipping the new equipment and ice cream supplies to you results in a charge 
of $150. Shipping was created as a cost resource because it has no associated 
work, and different shipping costs may apply to other tasks in the project.
Finally, the $2,500 cost for the mixers themselves was entered separately, as 
a fixed cost in the Cost table of Gantt Chart view.
And that’s how costs are assigned and how they add up on projects. When 
working in Project, you soon discover that although it has quite capable cost­
ing features, they’re probably some of the most underutilized.
	
You can create and assign resources that have no associated costs. For exam­
ple, if you want your boss to be available to review status reports but your 
company doesn’t require that your boss’s time be charged to the project, you 
can simply use those resource assignments to remind you about the need for 
your boss’s availability on that day or at that time.
When will this hit the bottom line?
In business, you rarely get to choose when you pay your own bills. In Project, 
however, you can choose when your costs affect your budget.
Resources can be set to accrue at the start or end of the task that they’re 
associated with or to be prorated throughout the life of the task. If a task of 
three months begins April 1, a $90 cost resource can be added to the actual 
costs to-date on Day 1, on Day 90, or at a dollar per day until the end of the 
task. Use the Accrue At field in Resource Sheet view or on the Costs tab of 
the Resource Information dialog box to set the accrual method.
This scenario isn’t exactly a purely realistic reflection of how you have to pay 
for costs because, let’s face it: Most bills come due 30 days after they hit your 
desk. It’s more a factor of when you want that cost to show up for the purposes 
of tracking costs and reporting expenses against the project.
Specifying Cost Information 
in the Project
Most projects involve a combination of cost types: work, material, and cost 
(or fixed cost). Before you can enter the information at the task or resource 
level, you have to do your homework to find out the fixed costs as well as the 
hourly or unit rates for all your resources.

150
Part II: Managing Resources 
During the planning stages, you may not be able to anticipate exactly what a 
particular cost will be or know every resource’s rates. In this instance, you 
may need to develop an estimate and progressively elaborate the estimate as 
you know more. For example, if you know that you have a project to upgrade 
the lighting, painting, and landscaping for the community in a property own­
er’s association, you might start with a high-level estimate for the landscap­
ing. As you find out more about the type of trees, shrubs, flowers, and labor 
you need, you can define costs at a more detailed and more accurate level. 
By starting with an estimate, at least some cost will be reflected in the plan, 
and you can enter more accurate information later, as soon as you know it.
	
Use a field in the Resource Sheet, such as Code, to designate resources as 
having estimated rates or costs so that you can easily go back to those tasks 
and update the estimates as the plan progresses.
You can’t avoid fixed costs
Maybe it’s that huge fee for the consulting company your boss insisted you 
use, even though you knew that the report wouldn’t tell you a thing you didn’t 
already know. Or perhaps it’s the $2,000 for a laptop computer you talked your 
boss into buying so that you could manage the project when you’re on the 
road. Whatever it is, it’s a cost that doesn’t change, no matter how many hours 
the task continues or how many people work on the task. It has no unit cost or 
rate per hour, and no actual hours of work are tracked. It’s a fixed cost.
You can specify this type of cost by creating a resource with a Cost type. 
Every time you assign the resource to a task, you specify the cost associated 
with it.
You can also simply enter a fixed cost associated with a task without having 
to create and assign a cost resource to it. To do so, you can use the Cost 
table in the sheet in Gantt Chart view.
	
A table is a preset column combination that simplifies entering certain infor­
mation in a sheet pane.
Follow these steps to enter a fixed cost for a task:
	
1.	Display the project in Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Click the View tab, and in the Data group, choose Tables➪Cost.
	
	 The table of columns appears, as shown in Figure 10-1. You can insert the 
Fixed Cost column into any sheet, but the Cost table is ready for you to use.
	
3.	Click the Fixed Cost column for the task to which you want to assign 
the cost and then enter the amount.

151
 Chapter 10: Determining a Project’s Cost
	
Figure 10-1: 
The Cost 
table.
	
That’s all there is to it, but because you can enter only one fixed-cost amount 
for a task, you should also enter a task note where you can itemize fixed 
costs if you have more than one. Note also that the default fixed-cost accrual 
method is prorated: If you prefer to have fixed costs hit the budget at the 
start or end of a task, use the Fixed Cost Accrual column in this table to 
select another option. Figure 10-1 shows the task to obtain permits and the 
task to purchase supplies as having their costs accrue at the start of the task.
Entering hourly, overtime, 
and cost-per-use rates
Whether it’s minimum wage or the astronomical fees your lawyer charges 
you every time you sneeze, most people are paid a certain amount per hour. 
To represent most people involved in the project, you create work resources 
and charge them to the project at an hourly rate. Some resources also charge 
an additional flat fee for each use. For example, a plumber may charge a trip 
charge or “show up” fee of $75 and then add the cost per hour. This flat fee is 
a cost per use, added every time you assign the resource to a task, no matter 
how many hours are involved in completing the task.
The first cost you enter is a resource’s hourly rate and an overtime rate (if 
the resource has one). After a resource has an hourly rate, you can enter the 
estimate of how many hours that person will work on each task he’s assigned 
to, Project totals his estimated costs in your plan and adds any cost per use. 
When you track actual effort expended on tasks, a calculation of actual effort 
multiplied by the hourly rate plus any cost-per-use returns actual costs.
	
By comparing estimated costs and actual costs, you form an ongoing picture 
of whether the project is within budget.

152
Part II: Managing Resources 
To set resource rates per hour and cost per use for a work resource, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Sheet view.
	
2.	Click the Std Rate column for the resource to which you want to 
assign a cost.
	
3.	Enter a dollar amount.
	
	If you’re entering a rate for a unit other than hours, type a slash (/) and 
then the unit (for example, year or month).
	
4.	Press Tab to go to the Ovt column.
	
5.	Enter a dollar amount.
	
6.	Press tab to move to the Cost/Use column.
	
7.	Type a dollar amount.
	
	This amount is the flat-fee amount that will be added every time you 
assign the resource to a task.
	
8.	Press Tab.
	
	 The entry is completed.
Figure 10-2 shows that the water and beverages are set up at a cost per 
gallon, with a setup fee for the company to deliver and set up the water and 
beverage stations.
	
Figure 10-2:

153
 Chapter 10: Determining a Project’s Cost
You can also make cost-rate entries in the Resource Information dialog box. 
The Costs tab of this dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-3, offers columns 
labeled Standard Rate, Overtime Rate, and Per Use Cost.
	
Figure 10-3: 
You can 
set several 
rates for a 
resource.
	
	
In many projects, you don’t track the cost per resource for internal resources 
because people’s salaried rates are generally considered confidential. 
Sometimes, a standard midrange or loaded-resource rate is used to track 
employee rates by job grade.
Assigning material resources
Calculating the cost of a material resource might take you back to solving 
problems in your old high school algebra class. Fortunately, if you aren’t an 
algebra whiz, Project makes a straightforward calculation to arrive at the 
cost of using a material resource.
When you assign a work resource to a task, Project multiplies its standard 
hourly rate by the hours of work for the assignment. But material resources 
don’t have hours of work: You pay for them by the unit quantity, not by the 
hour. So when you set up a material resource, you specify a standard rate 
for a single unit (per yard, or ton, or gallon, for example) and assign a certain 
number of units to each task. The cost is the number of units multiplied by 
the cost per use.

154
Part II: Managing Resources 
To assign a standard unit rate for a material resource, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Sheet view.
	
2.	If you haven’t already done so, click the Material Label column for 
that resource and then type a unit name (such as gallon).
	
3.	Click the Std Rate column for the resource you want to set and then 
type a dollar amount (such as the cost per gallon).
	
4.	Press Enter or Tab to finish the entry.
Note that you can also use the Resource Information dialog box to enter as 
many as five standard unit rates with effective dates to account for fluctuations 
in unit cost over the life of the project.
How Your Settings Affect Your Costs
In Chapter 9, I describe how to assign resources to tasks and how to assign 
those resources in certain units (percentages for work resources and quantity 
consumed for material resources). All these factors work together in calculat­
ing the cost of the resource when assigned to tasks.
Don’t worry about completing the calculations; Project does them for you. 
That’s the beauty of entering information in Project. After you specify settings 
for your resources, Project does the work of tallying and showing total costs to 
you in views, such as the Cost table of Gantt Chart view, shown in Figure 10-4.
Suppose that you want to assign a mechanic to a task with these parameters:
Base calendar: Night Shift (eight hours, six days per week, between 
11 p.m. and 8 a.m.)
Cost per hour: $20
Overtime cost: $30
Availability: 100 percent
Assigned to a 2-day task: 50 percent
Here’s how to calculate the cost of this resource: Two days at half-time avail­
ability based on an eight-hour calendar is a total of eight hours (four hours 
per day). The resource incurs no overtime, so the cost is 8 × $20, or $160.

155
 Chapter 10: Determining a Project’s Cost
	
Figure 10-4: 
Total costs 
at the 
summary-
task level.
	
Change two settings for the same resource to see what happens:
Assigned to a 2-day task: 150 percent
Amount of overtime authorized: 8 hours
Now the resource is working 12 hours per day (150 percent of 8 hours) over 
2 days. With 16 total hours at the standard rate ($20) and 8 hours of overtime 
($30), this person will cost $560.

s they say, the best-laid schemes of mice and project managers go oft 
awry, and the schedule is no different. After you take your best shot 
at laying out the project schedule, creating every task, and assigning every 
resource — and you think you’re ready to start your project — think again.
A close look at almost any schedule reveals issues that you should resolve 
before you begin working on the first task. These issues may include a sched­
ule that ends a month after the projected finish date, human resources who 
are assigned to work 36-hour days, or a budget that exceeds the national 
debt. (Details, details. . . .)
Even if you see no glaring problems related to time, workload, or cost, you 
should ensure that the project schedule is as realistic as possible before you 
commit to it. Take a moment to give the project the once-over by using filters 
to focus your attention on potential problem areas. You can also use the Task 
Inspector to pinpoint issues with the schedule or resources. If these options 
aren’t enough, Project identifies the problem areas and suggests solutions.
Everything Filters to the Bottom Line
The first step in solidifying the project schedule is simply to look at it from a 
few different perspectives — similar to circling a car to inspect all its features 
before you fork over the down payment. Filters help you gain that kind of 
perspective.

160
Part III: Before You Baseline 
At this stage, you can use filters to examine two major problem areas:
	
✓	Overallocated resources: Those resources working more than the 
number of hours you specified.
	
✓	Tasks on a critical path: The critical path consists of the series of tasks 
in the project that must be completed on time for the project to meet its 
final finish date.
One way to look at the critical path is that it’s the one with the least amount 
of slack (or float.) Any task that has slack — that is, any length of time that 
the task could be delayed without affecting a milestone or the entire project’s 
timing — is not on the critical path. If the project has multiple critical paths, 
or near-critical paths, any delays are likely to cause a problem. You can say 
that for every day the critical path slips, the project delivery date slips a day. 
Therefore, you can see the necessity of not only knowing the project’s critical 
(and near critical) paths, but also being able to easily check their status.
Setting predesigned filters
Filters work similarly to the Zoom feature in a word processor: They give you 
a close-up look at various aspects of your plan and help you spot clues about 
problems, such as overallocated resources. You can set a filter to highlight 
tasks or resources that meet certain criteria or to remove from view any 
tasks or resources that don’t meet the criteria.
Project provides predesigned filters that you can simply turn on for tasks or 
resources, using criteria such as
	
✓	Tasks with a cost more than a specified amount
	
✓	Tasks on the critical path
	
✓	Tasks that occur within a certain date range
	
✓	Milestone tasks
	
✓	Tasks that use resources in a resource group
	
✓	Tasks with overallocated resources
	
Several filters, such as Slipping Tasks and Over-Budget Work, help you spot 
problems after you’ve finalized the schedule and are tracking progress. (See 
Chapter 15 for more about tracking.)
You can access filters in a couple of ways. When you use the Filter drop-down 
list, you choose built-in filters from a list. The filters act to remove from view 
any tasks that don’t meet specified criteria and display the ones that do.

161
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
To turn on these filters from the View tab of the Ribbon, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to filter for 
resources or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to filter for tasks.
	
2.	In the Data group on the View tab, click the Filter drop-down list and 
choose a criterion.
	
	 The Filter list is a drop-down list; when no filter is applied, the list displays 
All Tasks or All Resources. If you choose a filter that requires input, you 
see a dialog box, such as the one shown in Figure 11-1. Otherwise, the 
filter is applied immediately, and it removes from view any resources or 
tasks that don’t match your criteria.
	
Figure 11-1: 
Entering 
filter 
parameters.
	
	
3.	If a dialog box is displayed, fill in the information and click the OK 
button.
	
	 The filter is applied.
To redisplay all tasks or resources, click the Filter drop-down list on the View 
tab and then select the No Filter option.
Putting AutoFilter to work
The Project 2013 AutoFilter feature is turned on by default for all new sched­
ule files. Arrows appear in the column headings in the displayed sheet. When 
you click the arrow in the Resource Names column, for example, the name of 
every resource assigned to tasks in the project is listed in alphabetical order, 
along with other filtering and sorting choices. See Figure 11-2 for an example. 
In the AutoFilter list for a column, select check boxes to control which items 
appear onscreen. Selected items appear, and deselected items are hidden by 
the filter. If you want to display only a few items, clear the Select All check 
box first to deselect all items and then select the check boxes next to indi­
vidual items to reselect them.

162
Part III: Before You Baseline	
Figure 11-2: 
Deselect 
the check 
box beside 
any item to 
hide it.	
You can also choose the Filters option from an AutoFilter menu to access 
predefined filters, or you can click Custom and create a custom filter. For 
example, Figure 11-3 shows the predefined Is Greater Than filter that’s avail­
able to the cost-related fields in the Cost table. In this case, the filter shows 
any task with a cost (total cost) between $2,000 and $4,000.	
Figure 11-3: 
AutoFilter 
choices are 
specific to 
each field.	
Follow these steps to use AutoFilter:	
1.	 Display the view and table that contain the fields (columns) you want
to filter.		
Arrows appear at the top of every column.	
2.	 Click the arrow on the column you want to filter.

163
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
	
3.	Use the Filters submenu to select a filter.
	
	 Select a predefined filter. For example, if you’re filtering for task cost, 
you can choose filters in the Total Cost column that look for costs 
greater than, equal to, or less than specified amounts. You can also set 
up another filter that looks for costs between two specified amounts. 
The Clear Filter from Field Name choice removes a previously applied 
filter.
	
4.	Click the OK button.
	
	 Any task that doesn’t meet your criteria temporarily disappears from 
the view.
	
To apply highlighting to items that meet your filter criteria rather than remove 
nonmatching items from view, use the Highlight list in the Data group on the 
View tab. This list works like the filter does except that it highlights the appli­
cable tasks.
Creating do-it-yourself filters
You don’t have to use predesigned filters: You can get creative and design your 
own filters. To define a new filter, you specify a field name, a test, and a value.
For example, the following line filters for any task on the critical path:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
You can also include additional qualifiers to the filter. The following example 
filters for tasks that are on the critical path and have a baseline cost of more 
than $5,000:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
and
Baseline Cost (field name) Is Greater Than (test) 5000 (value)
Here’s how to build your own filter definition:
	
1.	Choose View➪Filter➪More Filters.
	
	 The More Filters dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-4. It lists all 
available filters — built-in and custom.
	
2.	Select either the Task or Resource radio button to specify in which list 
of filters you want the new filter to be included.
	
3.	Click the New button.
	
	 The Filter Definition dialog box appears.

164

log box lists 
all available 
filters.
	
	
4.	In the Name field, type a name for the filter.
	
	If you want the filter to be easily accessed in the drop-down lists, select 
the Show in Menu check box.
	
5.	Click the first line of the Field Name column and then click the down 
arrow that appears to display the list of choices, as shown in Figure 11-5.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Give the 
new filter a 
name that 
describes 
what it 
does.
	
	
6.	Click a field name to select it.
	
7.	Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for the Test and Value(s) columns.
 
• Test is a condition that must be met, such as Does Not Equal or Is 
Greater Than.
 
• Value(s) is either a value you enter, such as a specific date or cost, 
or a predetermined value, such as baseline cost.
	
8.	If you want to add another condition, choose And or Or from the And/
Or column and then make choices for the next set of Field Name, Test, 
and Value(s) boxes.

165
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
	
	 Note that you can cut and paste rows of settings you’ve made to rear­
range them in the list, or use either the Copy Row or Delete Row button 
to perform those actions for filters with several lines of criteria.
	
9.	Click the Save button to save the new filter and then click Apply to 
apply the filter to your plan.
	
Click the Organizer button in the More Filters dialog box to copy filters you’ve 
created from one Project file to another file or to make them available in all 
your files by copying the new filter into the Global.MPT.
Gathering Information in Groups
Project 2013 uses the Group feature to chunk information into logical group­
ings based on predefined criteria. (You may recall working with the work 
breakdown structure, or WBS, in Chapter 2. where I show you how to decom­
pose the project into logical chunks of work.) For example, you can use the 
Group feature if you want to see resources organized by work group, or you 
may organize tasks by their duration, from shortest to longest.
Organizing tasks or resources in this way may help you spot a potential prob­
lem in the project — for example, if you find that the majority of resources 
at the project startup are unskilled or that most of the tasks at the end of the 
project are on the critical path. Like filters, groups come predefined, or you 
can create custom groups. Groups also have a function similar to outlining, in 
which you can collapse and expand groups to better zero in on the tasks or 
resources that you want to examine more closely.
Applying predefined groups
Predefined groups, which are quick and easy to apply, cover a host of 
common requirements in projects. Follow these steps to apply a predefined 
group structure to the project:
	
1.	Display either a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to group 
resources or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to group tasks.
	
2.	On the View tab, click the Group By list in the Data group and then 
choose a criterion.
	
	 The information is organized according to your selection. Figure 11-6 
shows Gantt Chart view grouped by milestone. Tasks that aren’t mile­
stones are collapsed.
To redisplay all tasks or resources in their original order, click the arrow in 
the Group list on the View tab to display the list. Then select the No Group 
option. (When no group is applied, the Group box displays [No Group].)

166
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
Figure 11-6: 
Tasks 
grouped as 
milestones.
	
Devising your own groups
Custom groups include three elements: a field name, a field type, and an 
order. For example, you may create a group that shows the field name (such 
as Baseline Work) and the field type (such as Task, Resource, or Assignment) 
in a certain order (descending or ascending). A group that shows Baseline 
Work for tasks in descending order, for example, would list tasks in order 
from the greatest number of work hours required to the least number 
required. Other settings you can specify for groups control the format of the 
group’s appearance, such as its font and font color.
Follow these steps to create a custom group:
	
1.	Choose View➪Group By➪More Groups.
	
	 The More Groups dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-7.
	
Figure 11-7:

Groups 
dialog box.
	
	
2.	Select either Task or Resource to specify in which list of groups you 
want to place the new group.

167
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
	
3.	Click the New button.
	
	 The Group Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-8.
	
Figure 11-8:

group.
	
	
4.	In the Name field, type a name for the group.
	
5.	Click the first line of the Field Name column, click the down arrow 
that appears to display the list of choices, and then click a field name 
to choose it.
	
6.	Repeat Step 5 for the Field Type and Order columns.
	
	 Note that if you want the Field Type option of grouping by assign­
ment rather than by resource or task, you must first select the Group 
Assignments, Not Tasks check box to make that field available to you. 
Otherwise, the field type of Task or Resource appears by default.
	
7.	If you want to add another sorting criteria, click a Then By row and 
make choices for the Field Name, Field Type, and Order columns.
	
8.	If you want the new group to be shown in the list when you click the 
Group box on the Formatting toolbar, select the Show in Menu check 
box.
	
9.	Depending on the field name you’ve chosen, you can make settings 
for the font, cell background, and pattern to format the group.
	
	 I tell you more about formatting the project schedule in Chapter 13.
	
10.	If you want to define intervals in which to organize the groups, click 
the Define Group Intervals button.
	
	 This step displays the Define Group Interval dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 11-9. Use these settings to specify a starting time and an interval. 
For example, if the Group By criterion is % Work Complete, and you 
select Interval as the Group On setting and then enter a group interval 

168
Part III: Before You Baseline 
of 10.00, groupings are in 10 percent intervals (those between 0 and 10 
percent in one grouping and those between 11 to 20 percent in another, 
and so on).

Group inter-
val options.
	
	
11.	Click the Save button to save the new group and then click Apply to 
apply the group to your plan.
	
If you want to make changes to an existing predefined group, choose View➪
Group By➪More Groups. In the More Groups dialog box, make sure that the 
group is selected and then click the Edit button. The Group Definition dialog 
box then appears so that you can edit all those settings for an existing group.
Figuring Out What’s Driving the Project
With all the activity taking place in a project — perhaps hundreds of tasks, 
thousands of dependencies, and calendars, for example — identifying the 
factors driving a project can be difficult. Three features in Project 2013 can 
help you see what’s driving the project and make those all-important tweaks 
before finalizing the project plan:
	
✓	Task Inspector pane: Identifies the factors driving the timing of tasks in 
the project, pinpoints problems, and suggests solutions
	
✓	Task warnings and suggestions: Help you identify possible schedule 
issues in manually scheduled tasks
	
✓	Multiple Undo: Lets you try different approaches and then undo several 
changes in a row
Inspecting tasks
When you play a round of golf, several factors can affect your game: an 
oncoming cold, bad weather, or a defective club. (These are the reasons 
I give myself, anyway.) Likewise, the timing of every task in a project is 

169
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
affected by certain conditions, known as task drivers. The Task Inspector 
pane can help you recognize these conditions, which can include
	
✓	Manual start dates or assignments: You have manually entered a start date, 
or you have assigned a resource to a task and the resource isn’t available.
	
✓	Calendars: You have assigned a different calendar to the task or resource, 
or both, and the calendar differences are causing a scheduling conflict.
	
✓	Leveling delay: If you’ve turned on leveling to handle resource over-
allocation, the leveling may have caused a task to be delayed. (I discuss 
leveling in Chapter 12.)
	
✓	Constraints: You apply a constraint to a task, such as forcing it to finish 
on a certain date.
	
✓	Summary tasks: Their timing is driven by the timing of their child tasks 
or subtasks.
	
✓	Dependency relationships: A predecessor task can cause changes in a 
task’s timing.
Even though you specify start and finish dates for manually scheduled tasks, 
you can use the Task Inspector to ensure that the task schedule you’ve estab­
lished works in conjunction with other tasks. Project performs behind-the-
scenes calculations to determine when each manually scheduled task is likely 
to occur based on predecessors and its duration. If Project detects that the 
task is likely to get off track, it warns you about the potential problem and 
suggests a solution.
To display the Task Inspector pane, change to a task-oriented view such as 
Gantt Chart view and simply click the Inspect Task button in the Schedule 
group on the Task tab. The Task Inspector pane appears. Click the task that 
you want to inspect, and the pane explains the various conditions driving 
the timing of the selected task, as shown in Figure 11-10. If the Task Inspector 
pane includes schedule change options such as the two shown in the figure, 
you can click the button for a solution to apply it to the task. Click the Close 
button in the Task Inspector pane when you’re done.
Handling task warnings and suggestions
When you work with auto-scheduled tasks, Project can reschedule them 
for you when you establish task dependencies. Because the start and finish 
dates of manually scheduled tasks are hard-wired (fixed), Project loses the 
useful ability to move them around when predecessor task schedules change. 
Even though Project can’t automatically move manually scheduled tasks, it 
performs forecasted calculations for completing each manually scheduled 
task based on the task’s links and other drivers. If Project finds that a poten­
tial scheduling problem may occur with a manually scheduled task, it alerts 
you — even when the Task Inspector pane isn’t open.

170
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
Figure 11-10: 
The Task 
Inspector 
pane shows 
you the 
influences 
on the 
timing of 
a task.
	
These alerts appear in the form of warnings (red, wavy underlines, typically 
under the task finish date in the Finish column of the task sheet) and sugges­
tions (usually green, wavy underlines, typically under the task start date in 
the Start column). Whereas warnings represent real-life problems that are 
likely to cause the project to finish off schedule, suggestions give you ideas 
for optimizing the schedule, perhaps improving on the projected finish date.
	
Schedule warnings appear only by default. To view suggestions instead, select 
the Task tab and click the drop-down arrow on the Inspect Task button in the 
Schedule group. Then choose Show Suggestions.
If you’ve used Microsoft Word, these wavy underlines should look familiar, 
and you work with them as you do in Word. Right-click the cell with the wavy 
underline to display a shortcut menu with options for addressing the poten­
tial schedule problem at the top, as shown in Figure 11-11. If you want to 
apply a schedule change option, click it on the shortcut menu. The available 
schedule change options for warnings are different from those for sugges­
tions, and they vary depending on whether any overallocated resources are 
assigned to the task.

171
 Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
	
Figure 11-11: 
Right-click 
a cell that 
shows a 
warning or 
suggestion 
underline.
	
Here’s a rundown of the choices you may see:
	
✓	Reschedule to Available Date: If an overallocated resource is assigned 
to the task, this choice reschedules all or part of the task to a time frame 
when the resource is available to handle the work.
	
✓	Respect Links: This warning solution moves the task based on the timing 
of its predecessor task. In most cases, this solution moves the task later 
based on the predecessor task’s schedule.
	
✓	Switch to Auto Schedule: This warning solution typically appears for 
manually scheduled summary tasks. It also appears as a suggestion solu­
tion for subtasks. Choosing this schedule change causes the summary task 
to recalculate based on the roll-up values of its subtasks. For subtasks, 
the switch typically means that the task can move to an earlier spot 
in the schedule, potentially improving the schedule for any successor 
tasks, too.
	
✓	Fix in Task Inspector: Clicking this choice opens the Task Inspector 
pane so that you can review the drivers and other scheduling factors for 
the task before choosing a schedule change.

172
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
Task scheduling warnings and suggestions typically don’t appear unless 
you’ve outlined the task list, creating summary tasks. Because some of the 
warning and scheduling calculations are based on summary task information, 
you should follow the good practice of organizing the schedule using the work 
breakdown structure (described in Chapter 2).
Undo, undo, undo
When Microsoft held a prerelease conference to announce new features 
in Project 2007, it touted Multiple Undo as its most requested feature and 
announced with glee that it had finally arrived. This feature is a big deal 
because individual changes to the project plan can have several ripple 
effects.
Multiple Undo allows you to try several changes and then undo the whole 
list of changes or a portion of them at one time. Because you often want to 
try out several changes when finalizing or otherwise making adjustments to a 
project (for example, changing the timing of several tasks or the hourly rates 
of several resources), Multiple Undo is quite handy.
	
To use Multiple Undo, you have to undo all your changes in order. For example, 
if you made five changes, and you want to undo the fourth change, you have 
to undo the first four changes in order. To undo a change, click the down 
arrow on the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar and then choose the 
change you want to undo. That change — and all other changes you made 
subsequently — are undone.

A

fter you know which issues are affecting the project schedule, you can 
start to develop ways to address them. Sometimes, you simply have 
to recognize that events (especially on projects) don’t always play out as 
planned. A sprinkling of contingency reserve may resolve the issue.
After you work out the initial version of the schedule, budget, and resource 
assignments, you meet with stakeholders to negotiate changes based on their 
priorities. For example, you might ask these questions:
	
✓	Can the schedule be altered to contain costs?
	
✓	Can in-house resources be added to expedite the work?
	
✓	Can less-expensive resources be hired to save money?
In this chapter, I describe multiple options for negotiating the various con­
straints of time, resources, scope, and costs that affect the project.
It’s About Time
Suppose that the boss asks you to commit to completing a project by a certain 
date. Your palms get sweaty and the pit of your stomach feels queasy, but 
then, for cover, you tack on a week to the targeted finish date and promise to 
deliver the impossible.

174
Part III: Before You Baseline 
You hope that you can do it. You want to do it. But can you do it?
Project helps you feel confident about committing to a time frame, because 
you can see how long every task takes to complete. Before you make prom­
ises to the boss, you had better know the total length of time to complete the 
project and its critical path — the longest series of tasks that must be com­
pleted on time in order to meet the overall project finish date.
The timing data for the project summary task tells you how long the entire 
project will take to complete. Simply display Gantt Chart view and look at the 
Duration, Start, and Finish columns. If the finish date isn’t feasible, you have 
to modify tasks or negotiate a different date. You can use filters and groups 
to identify the critical path in, for example, Gantt Chart view or Network 
Diagram view, as shown in Figure 12-1.
	
Figure 12-1: 
The 
Network 
Diagram 
view of the 
critical path.
	
Before you commit to an unreasonable date, remember Murphy’s Law: 
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. And it thrives on projects. To 
lessen Murphy’s influence, you allocate contingency reserve, as described in 
the next section “Applying contingency reserve.”
Applying contingency reserve
Contingency reserve is either time or money that is factored into the sched­
ule or the budget to mitigate identified risks. A risk is an uncertain event or 
condition that, if it occurs, affects the schedule (or another project objective, 
such as cost, resources, or performance). The proper way to deal with uncer­
tainty on a project is to conduct a thorough risk analysis, as described in the 
later sidebar “Working with risk.”
For those risks you accept, because you either choose not to develop a 
response or can’t further mitigate their probability or impact, you can set 

175
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
aside contingency reserve to address the event when and if it occurs. No 
prescribed equation can determine the appropriate amount of reserve to set 
aside; every project is different. Here’s a list of factors that generally indicate 
you should set aside more reserve:
	
✓	New or unproven technology
	
✓	Complex projects with numerous interfaces
	
✓	Projects that are unfamiliar to your organization
	
✓	Resources unfamiliar with the type of work to be done
	
✓	A constrained budget
	
✓	Business-critical or high-profile project
To provide contingency reserve in the schedule, an unresourced task is com­
monly added at the end of every project phase or before a major deliverable 
is due. This strategy increases the likelihood that you’ll meet the due date of 
a milestone or phase.
	
Set aside contingency reserve for both the schedule and the budget.
Working with risk
All projects have risk. Too many unknown fac­
tors are possible for you to be able to expect 
your project to go exactly as planned. To 
account for these unknown elements, take the 
time to follow these steps:
	 1.	 Work with your team to create a list of all 
possible risks.
	
	 Analyze the WBS, schedule, budget, tech­
nical documentation, and any other docu­
mentation you can get your hands on.
	 2.	 Calculate the probability that the risks 
you’ve identified will occur, and determine 
their impact.
	
	 For example, risks may affect the schedule, 
budget, scope, quality, stakeholder satis­
faction, or another objective.
	 3.	 Prioritize the risks by those that have the 
greatest impact and probability.
	 4.	 Develop a response plan for risks that are 
likely to have a significant impact if they 
occur.
	
	 Responses may include these strategies: 
Avoid the risk altogether, find a different 
way to perform a task, eliminate the risky 
part of the project, reduce the probability 
or impact of the event (or both), transfer the 
risk to someone else (such as a vendor) to 
handle, or accept the risk.
	 5.	 Update the project schedule.
	
	 Include the work, resources, time, and 
funding that are necessary to implement 
the risk responses as appropriate.

Part III: Before You Baseline 
Completing a task in less time
If you do your homework and add contingency reserve to the project (refer 
to the preceding section), you’re making the plan realistic but also adding 
time to the project. When the project finish date just won’t work for the 
powers that be, you have to try a few tactics to chop the timing down to size.
Checking dependencies
The timing of the plan is determined by the duration of each task and by 
its dependencies — the relationships you build between tasks. Ask yourself 
whether you’ve built all dependencies in the best way possible. Perhaps one 
task didn’t start until another was finished but the second task could have 
started two days before the end of its predecessor. Building in this type of 
overlap (known as fast tracking) can save you time.
	
Use the Task Inspector pane, covered in Chapter 11, to scope out dependencies.
Here’s an example: You created a finish-to-start relationship for the Do 
Research and Write Speech tasks, such that you couldn’t start writing the 
speech until your research was finished. But is that true? Couldn’t you do 
a first draft of the speech starting three fourths of the way through the 
research? Especially when you have two different resources working on 
those tasks, initiating the second task before the first is complete can save 
you time.
Over the life of a project with hundreds of tasks, adding that kind of overlap 
to even a few dozen tasks can save you a month of time or more.
	
You can take a refresher course in creating and changing dependencies in 
Chapter 4.
Managing the availability of resources 
(Or: We could use some help here!)
Another factor that drives timing is the availability of resources. Sometimes 
in a dependency relationship, one task can’t start before another ends, 
simply because the resources aren’t available until the predecessor task is 
over. Look for these potential problems with resource-dependent timing:
	
✓	You delayed the start of a task because a resource wasn’t available. But 
perhaps another resource can do the work. If so, switch resources and 
let the task start sooner.
	
✓	Project calculates the duration of auto-scheduled tasks (Fixed Work and 
Fixed Units with effort-driven scheduling) according to the number of 

177
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
resources available to do the work. If you add resources to these tasks, 
Project shortens their duration.
	
✓	If you assign a more highly skilled resource to certain tasks, you may be 
able to reduce the hours of work required to complete the task, because 
the skilled person can finish the work more quickly.
	
✓	Assigning more resources to tasks on the critical path can shorten those 
effort-driven tasks.
	
✓	You have money but no time or resources. Consider hiring an outside 
vendor to handle the work.
	
Chapter 9 covers the mechanics of making and changing resource assignments.
Cutting to the chase: Deleting tasks
When all else fails and you’ve reduced as much time as possible using the 
methods described in the preceding sections, it’s time to cut some specific 
corners. First, consider skipping nonvital tasks. Then ask whether you can 
revisit the goals of the project with stakeholders and perhaps reduce its scope 
so that you can jettison tasks from the schedule. You can even negotiate for 
less-stringent quality or performance levels.
	
Never eliminate all slack in the schedule. Slack is your friend; it provides 
scheduling flexibility around resources.
Trading time for cost
Sometimes, the most critical objective in a project is the schedule. If that’s 
the case on your project, you may be able to negotiate for a larger budget 
to reduce the overall duration. You then use the extra funds to pay for over­
time, add resources, expedite shipping, or increase the hourly commitment 
of existing resources. Reducing the schedule by throwing money (in the form 
of resources) at the problem is called crashing. However, not all tasks can 
be crashed. Tasks that have truly fixed durations take as long as they take, 
regardless of the number of resources you throw at them.
To crash the schedule, start by analyzing tasks to see where you can deduct 
the longest length of time from the schedule for the least cost. After you 
exploit this task, move to the next least-expensive task, and so on.
	
Focus only on the tasks that are on the critical path. Reducing the duration 
of tasks that aren’t on it does no good if you’re trying to reduce the overall 
length of the project.

178
Part III: Before You Baseline 
At some point, you’ll reduce the duration of the critical path to the extent 
that you have a different critical path. Then you can go to work on the new 
critical path.
The more you fast-track, crash, and de-scope the project, the more likely it 
is to be late. That’s right: At some point, you’ll have compressed as much 
time as possible from the schedule and it will have multiple critical paths 
and near-critical paths. If any task on any of those paths slips, the project will 
need to use some contingency reserve. And if you aren’t careful, you’ll use it 
all up and make the project late.
Getting What You Want for Less
After you assign all resources to tasks and set all fixed costs, sticker shock 
may set in. Project tallies all those costs and shows you the project’s budget. 
If those numbers simply won’t work, follow these tips for trimming the 
bottom line:
	
✓	Use less-expensive resources. A high-priced engineer may be assigned 
to a task that can be performed by a junior engineer, for example. Or 
you may have assigned a high-priced manager to supervise a task that 
can be handled by a lower-salaried line supervisor.
	
✓	Lower fixed costs. If the budget allows for the travel costs associated 
with four plant visits, calculate whether you can manage with only three, 
and try to book flights ahead of time to get cheaper airfares. Look for a 
vendor who can sell you that piece of equipment for less than the $4,000 
you allocated — or make the old equipment last for one more project.
	
✓	Reduce overtime. If resources who earn overtime are overallocated, 
reduce their hours or use resources who are on straight salary for those 
14-hour days.
	
✓	Complete the task in less time. The resource cost is a factor of task 
duration, hourly wage, or number of units. If you change tasks so that 
fewer work hours are needed in order to complete them, tasks cost less. 
However, don’t be unrealistic about the time it truly takes to complete 
the work.
	
The Budget report calculates the total projected costs of the project based 
on all the resource, assignment, and cost information you enter. Chapter 18 
covers how to create Project reports.

 Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
The Resource Recourse
Before you finalize the plan, consider resource workload. As you delved into 
assigning resources to tasks in the project, you probably created situations 
where resources must work around the clock for days on end. The first step 
in finalizing your resources is to spot those overallocations — then you have 
to help those poor folks out!
Checking resource availability
To resolve problems with resource assignments, you have to first figure out 
where the problems lie by taking a look at a few views that focus on resource 
assignment.
Resource Usage view, shown in Figure 12-2, and Resource Graph view, shown 
in Figure 12-3, are useful in helping you spot overbooked resources. In Resource 
Usage view, the overbooked resource is shown in red, and the exclamation-
point-in-a-yellow-diamond indicator appears. In Resource Graph view, the 
graph bars are shown in red for any allocation over the units allowed for the 
resource. In this case, Ally is assigned for a maximum of 50 percent, or 4 hours 
in any single day.
Keep in mind that resources are flagged as overallocated in these Resource 
views based on their assignment percentages and calendars. A resource 
based on a standard calendar showing 8-hour days, assigned at 100 percent 
to a task, will work 8 hours a day on it. If you assign the same resource at 
50 percent to another task that happens at the same time, the resource will 
put in 12-hour days (8 plus 4) and be marked as overallocated.
	
Figure 12-2: 
Resource 
Usage view 
spells out 
the work-
load day 
by day.
	

180
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
Figure 12-3: 
Resource 
Graph view 
gives you 
a visual 
clue to 
overworked 
resources.
	
In Resource Usage view, any overallocated resource has the exclamation 
point in the Indicator column. The total hours that the resource is working 
each day on his combined tasks are summarized on the line that lists the 
resource’s name. In Resource Graph view, work is summarized in the Peak 
Units row at the bottom, and all work that exceeds the maximum allowable 
amount is highlighted in the bar graphic.
Deleting or modifying a 
resource assignment
Suppose that you discover that a resource (I’ll call her Janet) is working 42 
hours on Tuesday and 83 hours on Friday. You have several options to rec­
tify the workload:
	
✓	Remove Janet from a few tasks to free up some time. This option is 
good if she’s working on noncritical tasks, especially if other resources 
are working on those same tasks.
	
✓	Change Janet’s Resource calendar to allow for a longer workday — 
for example, 12 hours. A 100 percent assignment will therefore have 

181
Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
Janet working 12 hours on any single task in a day. If you stretch a 
resource’s workday, reduce the resource’s assignments also. For 
example, if someone frequently spends 16 hours on two tasks in one 
day (based on an 8-hour calendar) and two 100 percent assignments, 
change to a 12-hour calendar and 50 percent assignments (6 hours on 
each of the two tasks, totaling 12 hours a day). However, if the resource 
typically works an 8-hour day and 12- or 16-hour days are the exception, 
don’t change the resource’s base calendar; it will affect all assignments 
for that resource. And if an overtime pay rate applies, remember to 
authorize (add) it.
		The first two options in this list may lengthen the tasks that the resource 
is assigned to, regardless of whether you remove the resource or reduce 
the resource’s assignment.	
✓	Change Janet’s availability by increasing her assignment units to 
more than 100% in the Resource Information dialog box. For example, 
if you enter 150% as her available units, you’re authorizing her to work 
12 hours a day, and Project then doesn’t consider her overallocated 
until her working time exceeds 12 hours.	
✓	Use Team Planner view to shuffle some of Janet’s tasks to other 
resources. When you’re making the switch, Team Planner view provides 
the best visibility into how changes affect various resources.	
✓	Ignore the problem. I don’t mean this statement facetiously; some­
times, a resource can reasonably work 14 hours for a day or two during 
the life of a project, and you don’t need to change the resource’s usual 
working allocation to eliminate the exclamation point in the indicator 
column. (However, let Janet order pizza on the company’s tab on those 
long workdays — and don’t let them become the norm.) A resource who 
is scheduled for even a few minutes more than the calendar allows is 
flagged as overallocated. As the project manager, it isn’t worth the effort 
for you to attempt to resolve tiny overallocations that don’t affect the 
project schedule.
Beating overallocations with 
quick-and-dirty rescheduling
Gantt Chart view also clues you in to overbooked resources. When a task has 
an overallocated resource assigned, the Overallocation icon (it looks like a 
little person) appears in the Indicator column. To fix the overallocation, you 
can right-click the icon and choose Reschedule to Available Date, as shown in 
Figure 12-4. This method reschedules all or part of the task to a period when 
the resource is available to fix the overallocation, if possible. You can always 

182
Part III: Before You Baseline 
undo the change if you disagree with its impact on the overall project sched­
ule. This method can’t fix all overallocations, so if the icon remains after you 
choose Reschedule to Available Date, look at other methods to resolve the 
problem. Right-clicking the icon again and choosing Fix in Task Inspector 
from the menu enables the Task Inspector to give you ideas for fixing the 
overallocation.
	
Figure 12-4: 
Using the 
overalloca-
tion icon to 
reschedule 
the task.
	
Finding help
When one person is overworked, you have to look for help. You can free 
resources in several ways.
For starters, you can assign someone to help on a task and thus reduce the 
overbooked resource’s workload. Reduce the resource’s work assignment 
on one or more tasks, perhaps by reducing 100 percent assignments to 50 
percent. You do this in the Task Information dialog box on the Resources tab 
or by selecting the task and clicking the Assign Resources tool to open the 
Assign Resources dialog box.
	
Quickly check a work graph for any resource by clicking the Graphs button in 
the Assign Resources dialog box.

183
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
You’ll also find that by adding resources to certain tasks, you shorten the 
task duration. You may, therefore, free the resource in time to eliminate a 
conflict with a later task in the project.
Experiment with changing the work contour of the resource. By default, 
Project has a resource work on a task at the same level, or flat-loaded, for 
the life of the task. You can modify the work contour, for example, so that a 
resource invests the highest level of effort at the start of a task, which frees 
the resource’s workload later when a conflict with another assignment might 
occur. See Chapter 9 for information about how to apply a work contour to a 
resource assignment.
Leveling resources
Project calculates resource leveling to try to resolve resource overallocations 
in the project. The feature works in two ways: by delaying a task until the 
overbooked resource is freed up or by splitting tasks. Splitting a task involves 
(essentially) stopping it at some point, thereby freeing the resource, and then 
resuming it later, when the resource is available.
You can make these types of changes yourself or let Project make the calcula­
tion. Project first delays tasks that involve overallocated resources to use up 
any available slack. When no more slack is available on these tasks, Project 
makes changes based on any priorities you’ve entered for tasks, dependency 
relationships that are affected, and task constraints (such as a Finish No 
Later Than constraint).
Don’t worry: You can turn on leveling to see which changes Project would make 
and then clear the leveling to reverse those actions if you don’t like the results.
To level the resources in the project, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Resource tab, go to the Level group and select Leveling 
Options.
	
	 The Resource Leveling dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-5.
	
Figure 12-5: 
The 
Resource 
Leveling 
dialog box.
	

184
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
2.	Choose whether to allow Project to level automatically or manually:
 
• Automatic tells Project to level every time you change the plan.
 
• Manual requires you to click the Level All button in the Resource 
Leveling dialog box or use the Level All button on the Resource tab.
	
3.	If you choose to level automatically, select the Clear Leveling Values 
before Leveling check box if you want previous leveling actions to be 
reversed before you level the next time.
	
4.	Set the leveling range to one of these options:
 
• Level Entire Project
 
• Level <a date range>
	
	If you choose the latter option, fill in a date range by making 
choices in the From and To boxes.
	
5.	From the Leveling Order drop-down list, click the down arrow and 
make a choice:
 
• Standard considers slack, dependencies, priorities, and constraints.
 
• ID Only delays or splits the task with the highest ID number — in 
other words, the last task in the project.
 
• Priority, Standard uses task priority as the first criterion in making 
choices to delay or split tasks (rather than using up slack).
	
6.	Select any of the five check boxes at the bottom to control how Project 
levels:
 
• Level Only within Available Slack: No critical tasks are delayed, and 
the current finish date for the project is retained.
 
• Leveling Can Adjust Individual Assignments on a Task: Project 
removes or changes assignments.
 
• Leveling Can Create Splits in the Remaining Work: Certain tasks are 
placed on hold until resources are freed up for work.
 
• Level Resources with the Proposed Booking Type: Booking type (pro­
posed or committed) relates to the firmness of your commitment 
to using that particular resource. Allowing resource leveling to 
consider a resource’s booking type means that committed resource 
assignments are considered more sacred than proposed assign­
ments when Project makes changes.
 
• Level Manually Scheduled Tasks: Project moves the task even if 
you’ve scheduled it manually.
	
7.	Click the Level All button to have Project perform the leveling operation.
	
To reverse leveling, choose Resource Tab➪Clear Leveling.

185
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Project Constraints
When you have only a few instances of overallocated resources, enter Team 
Planner view and choose Level Resource. Select the resource from the Level 
Resources dialog box and then click Level Now.
	
To be successful, take the time to find the best combination of all these meth­
ods. Solving problems is often a trial-and-error process. Although you may ini­
tially look for a single quick fix, the best solution usually results from making 
lots of small changes.
Rescheduling the Project
From time to time, you have to hit the brakes on a project. For example, you 
may set up an entire project plan, and just as you’re ready to start rolling, 
the project is put on hold, caused by a budget shortfall, priorities that have 
changed, resources being pulled to another project, or cold feet on the part 
of stakeholders. It happens, but it also happens that projects have a way of 
coming back to life. The good news for you is that if the essential facts of the 
project (such as its scope and the resources you’ve planned to use) haven’t 
changed, you can simply reschedule the entire project to start from a later 
date rather than rebuild the plan from scratch. This process reschedules 
both auto-scheduled and manually scheduled tasks so that you don’t even 
have to use your thinking cap.
To reschedule the project, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Project➪Move Project.
	
	 The Move Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6. You can 
use it to reschedule an entire project that was put on hold.
To level or not to level?
As both a process and a program feature, 
resource leveling has pros and cons. It can make 
changes that you may not want it to make — 
for example, removing a resource from a task 
where you absolutely need that person’s unique 
skills. Leveling frequently delays the project’s 
finish date, which may not be acceptable to you 
(or your boss).
The safest setting for resource leveling (the 
one that makes the least drastic changes to the 
timing) is to level only within slack. This setting 
may delay certain tasks, but it doesn’t delay the 
project completion date.
If you can’t live with the changes resulting from 
resource leveling, the capability to turn it on 
and off is vital. After you turn on this feature, 
look at its changes to resolve resource prob­
lems, and then turn it off and manually institute 
the portions of the solution that work for you. 
Remember that the Multiple Undo feature lets 
you make several changes manually and then 
lets you undo them all.

ou may know the saying “Clothes make the man.” Well, in the same 
spirit, sometimes the look of the schedule makes the project. Having a 
project that looks good serves two purposes: It impresses people with your 
professionalism (sometimes to the point that they’ll overlook a little cost 
overrun), and people can look at the project on the screen and on hard copy 
to easily discern the different boxes, bars, and lines.
Project uses default formatting that’s helpful in most cases. However, if you 
have certain company standards for reporting — say, representing baseline 
data in yellow and actual data in blue, or more frequent gridlines to help the 
nearsighted CEO read Project reports more easily — Project has you covered.
Whatever you need, Project provides tremendous flexibility in formatting 
various elements in the plan.

188
Part III: Before You Baseline 
Looking Good!
Microsoft has decided to capitulate to the artist in all of us by allowing users 
to modify shapes, colors, patterns, and other graphical elements in the 
Project schedule. You gain great flexibility in determining how the schedule 
looks.
	
When you print a Project view (as covered in Chapter 18), you can print a 
legend on every page. The legend helps readers comprehend the meaning 
of the various colors in the plan (or the shading, if it’s printed in black and 
white) along with shapes that you set for elements.
All the views and formatting choices that Project offers you aren’t confined 
to the screen; you can print the project or reports. Whatever information is 
displayed onscreen when you print a view is also printed. So knowing how 
to make all kinds of changes on-screen allows you to present information to 
team members, managers, vendors, and clients on hard copy too.
	
By using all the improved methods of collaborating on projects, such as sharing 
documents via Project Web App, you can make a visually appealing schedule 
available to even more people across the web.
Printing in color is useful because you can provide the full visual impact 
and nuance of the various colors used for graphical elements, such as task 
bars and indicators. If you print in black and white, you may find that certain 
colors that look good onscreen aren’t distinct when you print them. When 
you can modify the formatting, the project can look good in color and in 
black and white, and on-screen and in print.
Formatting the Gantt Chart
Project 2013 allows you to customize the Gantt chart in several ways. You 
can choose different task bars, add text inside task bars, and supply different 
ends. You can highlight the critical path so that it stands out, and you can 
change the font styles in the sheet section of the schedule.
Formatting task bars
Task bars are the horizontal boxes that represent the timing of tasks in the 
Chart pane of Gantt Chart view. You can format a bar individually, change 

189
 Chapter 13: Making the Project Look Good
the formatting settings on different types of task bars, or apply a new style that 
controls bar formatting on the entire chart.
You can change several characteristics about task bars:
	
✓	The shape that appears at the start and end of the bar: The ends can 
be formatted with different shapes, such as arrows and triangles.
	
✓	The shape, pattern, and color of the middle of the bar: You can change 
the shape’s type and color.
	
✓	The text that you can set to appear in five locations around the bar 
(to the left or right of the bar or above, below, or inside it): You can 
include text in any or all of these locations; just don’t add so many text 
items that they become impossible to read. As a rule, use only enough 
text to help readers of the plan identify information, especially on print­
outs of large schedules where a task may appear far to the right of the 
Task Name column that identifies it by name in the sheet area.
When you track progress on a task, a progress bar is superimposed on the 
task bar. You can format the shape, pattern, and color of the progress bar. 
The goal is to contrast the progress bar with the baseline task bar so that 
you can see both clearly.
	
By formatting task bars, you can help readers of the plan identify various ele­
ments, such as progress or milestones. If you make changes to individual task 
bars, people who are accustomed to the standard formatting in Project may 
have trouble reading the plan. In other words, don’t get carried away.
To create formatting settings for various types of task bars, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	From the Format tab, select Format in the Bar Styles group and then 
choose Bar Styles.
	
	 The Bar Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
	
Figure 13-1: 
Customizing 
the bars 
styles and 
the text.
	
	
2.	On the spreadsheet, along the top in the Name column, select the 
type of task that you want to modify (Split, Progress, or Milestone, for 
example).

190
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
	 To modify the styles used for all summary tasks, for example, select 
Summary. The choices on the Bars tab in the bottom half of the dialog 
box change based on the selected task type.
	
3.	Click in the Show For Tasks column for the task type you want 
to modify and then select criteria for the task, such as Critical or 
Finished, from the drop-down list that appears.
	
4.	Click the Bars tab to display it, if necessary, and then click the down 
arrows next to the following options:
 
• Shape: Modify the shape of either end or the middle of the task bar.
	
	Shapes on either end may be any one of 24 shapes (as shown in 
Figure 13-2), though you may commonly see an arrow, a diamond, 
or a circle. The shape in the middle consists of a bar of a certain width.

• Color: Modify the color used on either end or in the middle of the 
task bar.
	
	Project now enables you to choose among various theme colors 
(as in the other Office applications).
 
• Type: Modify the type of formatting for the shape on either end of 
the task bar.
	
	This setting controls how the shape is outlined: framed with a solid 
line, surrounded by a dashed line, or filled in with a solid color.
 
• Pattern: Select another pattern for the middle of the bar.

If you want to make the same types of changes to an individual task bar rather 
than to all task bars of a certain type, right-click the task bar and choose the 
Format Bar option. The Format Bar dialog box appears, offering the same Text 
and Bars tabs found in the Bar Styles dialog box, without the options at the 
top to select the type of item to format.
Zeroing in on critical issues
The Gantt chart doesn’t show the critical path by default. All subtask task 
bars appear in blue, no matter the specifics surrounding the task. To give the 
critical path visibility, you can make the bars for critical paths appear in a 
color that stands out, such as dark red.
Displaying the critical path is a snap: Simply click the Gantt Chart Tools Format 
contextual tab on the Ribbon and then select the Critical Tasks check box in 
the Bar Styles group. Whenever Critical Tasks is selected, Project applies the 
special color to the critical task bars.
Restyling the Gantt chart
If those boring red and blue Gantt bars are cramping your style, not to worry: 
You can try a new look, including a different color scheme, by applying a new 
Gantt Chart style. Working in Gantt Chart view, click the Gantt Chart Tools 
Format contextual tab. Then click the More drop-down button in the Gantt 
Chart Style group to display the available styles, as shown in Figure 13-4. 
Select the style you want, and Project reformats the whole project. It doesn’t 
get much simpler!
If you want to format the sheet portion of Gantt Chart view, too, start by 
clicking the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab. Click the Text Styles 
button in the Format group to open a dialog box for changing the text font, 
size, and other options. Figure 13-5 shows a customization of critical tasks 
to have a bold oblique font with a yellow background. You can choose any 

192
Part III: Before You Baseline 
font, style, size, color, pattern, or background for the font style. You aren’t 
limited to changing only critical tasks; you have 18 other types of tasks you 
can change, including milestones, summary tasks, and bar styles. You can 
also use the Wrap Text button in the Columns group to control whether text 
automatically wraps in a particular cell or column.

Formatting Task Boxes
Network Diagram task boxes use different shapes to help you spot different 
types of tasks:
	
✓	Summary tasks use a slightly slanted box shape and include a plus sign 
(+) or minus symbol (–), depending on whether the summary task’s sub­
tasks are hidden or displayed. Click the symbol to hide or display subtasks.
	
✓	Subtasks show up in simple rectangular boxes.
	
✓	Milestones are shown in diamond-shaped boxes with blue shading.
	
✓	Manually scheduled tasks have a diagonal pattern to distinguish them 
from auto-scheduled tasks.
You can change the formatting of each task box individually or by type. To 
change the formatting of task boxes displayed in Network Diagram view, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Network Diagram view.
	
2.	Right-click the task box that you want to change and then choose 
Format Box.
	
	 Alternatively, right-click anywhere outside the task boxes and then choose 
Box Styles to change the formatting of all boxes of a certain style.
	
	 The Format Box dialog box (or the Box Styles dialog box) appears, as 
shown in Figure 13-6.
	
Figure 13-6:

3.	To modify the border style, make selections in the Shape, Color, and 
Width lists.
	
4.	To modify the background area inside the box, make a selection in 
the Color list or Pattern list, or both (at the bottom of the dialog box).
	
5.	Click the OK button to save these new settings.
	
When you modify the formatting of individual boxes in Network Diagram view, 
the standard settings of slanted summary tasks and shaded milestones no 
longer serve as visual guides to all tasks. If you make changes and decide to 
restore a task box to its default setting, click the Reset button in the Format 
Box dialog box.
Adjusting the Layout
In addition to displaying particular columns and formatting task bars, you 
can make certain changes to the layout of the view. These options vary a 
great deal, depending on the view. The layout of Calendar view and Network 
Diagram view is quite different from the layout choices offered in Gantt Chart 
view, for example.
To display the Layout dialog box for a view, right-click the area (for exam­
ple, the chart area in Gantt Chart view) or anywhere in Calendar view or 
Network Diagram view and then choose Layout from the menu that appears. 
Alternatively, regardless of the view, you can select the Layout option from 
the View tab. The appropriate dialog box appears. Figures 13-7, 13-8, and 13-9 
show the various layout choices available in different views.
The settings in these Layout dialog boxes generally reflect how the elements 
on the page are arranged and how dependency link lines are displayed.
Table 13-1 describes the layout settings. You could likely spend a week or so 
experimenting with all these settings to see what they look like, and I could 
spend a few days writing about the various options. The tools that Project 
offers to modify the formatting of elements such as task bars and task boxes 
provide helpful flexibility.

 Chapter 13: Making the Project Look Good
Now that you know the options available for modifying view layouts, I have 
some advice: Stick with the default settings unless you have a specific reason 
to make a change (such as when you want to highlight certain types of infor­
mation for a project presentation). When you no longer need a layout change, 
return to the default settings. Or if you want to make changes, make them 
globally across the organization and stick to them. Then someone reading 
the project plan can more easily interpret the different kinds of information 
presented in views. Generally speaking, if you tinker too often with the way 
Project displays information, it only makes your own learning curve steeper — 
and confuses those who know the default settings in Project.
Modifying Gridlines
Just as phone numbers are divided into several shorter sets of numbers to 
help you remember them, visual elements are often broken up graphically 
to help you understand information in chunks. Tables use lines, calendars 
use boxes, football fields use yard lines, and so on.
Several views in Project include gridlines to indicate certain elements, such 
as a break between weeks or the status date (that is, the date to which 
progress has been tracked on a project). These lines help someone reading 
the plan to discern intervals of time or breaks in information; for example, 
gridlines can be used to indicate major and minor column breaks. You can 
modify these gridlines in several ways, including changing the color and style 
of the lines and the interval at which they appear.
To modify gridlines, use the Gridlines dialog box and follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click any area of a view that contains a grid (for example, the 
chart area of Gantt Chart view or Calendar view) and then choose 
Gridlines.
	
	 The Gridlines dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-10. You can also 
display the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab, select Gridlines in 
the Format group, and then click Gridlines to open the dialog box.
	
Figure 13-10: 
The 
Gridlines 
dialog box.
	

198
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
2.	In the Line to Change list, select the gridline you want to modify.
	
3.	Use the Normal Type and Color lists to select a line style and color.
	
4.	If you want to use a contrasting color at various intervals in the grid to 
make it easier to read, follow these steps:
	
a.	Select an interval at which to include a contrasting line.
	
	This setting is typically used with a different style or color from 
the Normal line setting to mark minor intervals for a grid. Note that 
not every type of gridline can use contrasting intervals.
	
b.	Choose the type and color of that line from the lists.
	
5.	Click the OK button to save these settings.
	
You make choices for modifying gridlines one by one, and you have no Reset 
button to revert to the original settings. Gridlines modified in one view don’t 
affect gridlines in any other view.
Recognizing When a Picture 
Can Say It All
Words, numbers, task bars, and task boxes work well in the plan, but you 
may want to add elements of your own, such as drawing a circle around a 
task to draw attention to it or adding a simple drawing to show a process or 
working relationship.
You can use a drawing tool on the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab of 
the Ribbon to draw images in the chart area of Gantt Chart view. Follow these 
steps to add a drawing:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Choose Gantt Chart Tools Format tab➪Drawing.
	
	 The menu of available shapes and commands appears, as shown in 
Figure 13-11.
	
3.	Click the drawing tool that represents the type of object you want to 
draw, such as an oval or a rectangle.
	
4.	At the location on the chart where you want to draw the object, drag 
the mouse until the item is drawn approximately to the scale you want.
	
5.	Release the mouse button.

ing tools to

shapes.		
When you draw an object over an element such as a task bar, the drawn 
object is solid white and covers up whatever is beneath it. You have a couple 
of choices if you want the item underneath to show through:	
✓	Right-click the object, choose Properties, and click None in the Fill sec­
tion of the Format Drawing dialog box to remove the fill.	
✓	Right-click the object, choose Arrange, and choose Send to Back to place 
the object behind the chart elements.
At this point, you have these options:	
✓	Add text: If you drew a text box, you can click in it and then type what­
ever text you want.	
✓	Resize objects: Resize any object you’ve drawn by selecting it and then 
dragging any of the resize handles (the little black boxes) around its 
edges outward to enlarge it or inward to shrink it.	
✓	Move objects: Move the mouse over the object until the mouse pointer 
becomes a four-way arrow. Then drag the object elsewhere on the chart.

Creating a Custom Text Field
The tables that Project offers for sheet views often restrict you to particular 
types of entries. For example, you have to enter a numerical value in any 
cost-related field. Project offers a number of placeholder fields that you can 
customize for your own purposes and add to any task or resource table. You 
can customize the text, cost, number, flag, and other types of fields. A neat 
shortcut is to create a custom field with a lookup table.
You can use a lookup table to create a drop-down list of values to select to 
create a custom field. That is, when you click a cell in the field, you can then 
click the drop-down list arrow that appears and select predefined entries. 
Suppose that you want to add a field that indicates whether a resource has 
completed training. Creating a custom field with the lookup table offering the 
possible entries Yes, No, and Partial can make data entry faster and also help 
prevent data-entry mistakes that can occur if the field has no restrictions. By 
default, only the entries in the lookup table may be entered for the field.
To create and use a custom text field with a lookup table, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the task- or resource-oriented view and then display the table 
that you want to customize.
	
	You display tables by choosing Tables from the View tab and selecting a 
table from the list that appears.
	
2.	Right-click any field column heading and choose Custom Fields from 
the shortcut menu that appears.
	
	 The Custom Fields dialog box appears.
	
3.	Select the type of field you want from the list of options, as shown in 
Figure 13-12.
	
4.	Click Rename, type a name for the field in the Rename Field dialog 
box, and click the OK button.
	
5.	Back in the Custom Fields dialog box, click the Lookup button.
	
	 The Edit Lookup Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-13.

hen you go on a diet (hasn’t everyone?), you step on the scale the 
first day to record your starting weight. Then, as the diet progresses, 
you have a benchmark against which you can compare your dieting ups and 
downs.
Project lets you benchmark project data so that you can compare the actual 
activity that takes place on tasks against the original plan. This saved version 
of the plan data, or baseline, includes all information in the project, such as 
task timing, resource assignments, and costs.
The interim plan in Project is essentially a timing checklist. It includes the 
start and finish dates of tasks, and the estimated start and finish dates for 
tasks not yet started.
This chapter shows you when, why, and how to save a baseline and an 
interim plan for the project.
All about Baselines
After you complete all the planning necessary to develop a robust schedule 
(and other documents) for a project, and after you’ve made the schedule 
presentable, it’s time to baseline it. The baseline represents the project at the 
moment you consider the plan final and you’re ready to commit to it before 
you begin any activity. The baseline, which is saved in the original Project 
file, exists alongside the activity you record on tasks in the project.
Key data that a baseline captures includes the baseline start, finish, duration, 
work, and cost information for each task. After you save a baseline and track 

204
Part III: Before You Baseline 
activity against it, you can get baseline data and actual sets data, as well as 
visual indications of actual data.
You can use a baseline to debrief yourself or the team at any point in a proj­
ect. The baseline is especially useful at the end of a phase, when you can 
compare actual progress against estimates from many weeks or months ago. 
You can then improve your planning skills and learn to make more accurate 
estimates up front. You can also use a baseline and the actual activity that 
you track against it to explain delays or cost overruns and to illustrate the 
impact of significant scope changes to employers or clients by using a wide 
variety of reports and printed views.
	
It’s a good practice to revisit the baseline and estimates at the end of each 
phase of the project. If the project lasts longer than six months, however, 
you’re missing out on an opportunity to learn as you go. Plus you’ll likely 
forget what you were thinking when you produced the original estimates.
Finally, you can also save and clear baselines for only selected tasks. If one 
task is thrown off track by a major change, for example, you can modify its 
estimates and leave the rest of the baseline alone.
Saving a baseline
You can save a baseline at any time by opening the Set Baseline dialog box. 
One setting — which controls how Project rolls up data to summary tasks 
when you set a baseline for part of the tasks — requires explanation.
After you save a baseline the first time, the baseline data of a summary task 
is updated, by default, if you make changes to a subtask below it, such as 
changing the schedule for a subtask or deleting it. However, when you’re 
saving the baseline for only a selection of tasks, you can change that function­
ality by making a choice about how the baseline rolls up, or summarizes, data. 
You can choose to have modifications rolled up to all summary tasks or only 
from subtasks for any summary tasks you select. This second option works 
only if you’ve selected summary tasks and haven’t selected their subtasks.
To use rolling wave planning, save a baseline for only selected tasks. In other 
words, perhaps you’ve sufficiently detailed the early tasks in the first phase 
or first month or two of a large project, and you’re ready to commit to that 
part of the plan, but the latter detail still remains to be hammered out. Saving 
a baseline for earlier tasks allows you and the team to get working on those 
tasks while allowing for the progressive detailing of later tasks down the line.
To save a baseline, follow these steps:
	
1.	To save a baseline for only certain tasks, select them by dragging over 
their task ID (row) numbers.

205
 Chapter 14: It All Begins with a Baseline
	
2.	Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Set Baseline.
	
	 The Set Baseline dialog box appears, with the Set Baseline option 
selected, as shown in Figure 14-1.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Setting 
baselines 
and interim 
plans.
	
	
3.	Select either the Entire Project or the Selected Tasks radio button.
	
4.	If you chose Selected Tasks in Step 3, make selections for how the 
baseline rolls up changes to task data.
	
	 You can summarize changed data in all summary tasks or for only 
selected summary tasks.
	
5.	Click the OK button to set the baseline.
Saving more than one baseline
The concept of multiple baselines seems almost contrary to the definition of 
a baseline. After all, the purpose of a baseline is to set the proverbial stake in 
the sand and measure progress against it. You might keep multiple baselines 
for several purposes. Consider these reasons:
	
✓	You have a baseline plan for a customer and another one for the inter­
nal team. In other words, you might want to steer the team to a tighter 
deadline than the promised delivery date.
	
✓	You have multiple scenarios for the project. Maybe you’re unsure 
whether you’ll need an extra widget for the gadget you’re building. You 
can set one baseline that assumes the extra widget is unnecessary and set 
another baseline that assumes it’s vital.
	
✓	You’re anticipating a risk event taking place. You want to develop a 
recovery plan or response plan in one baseline version of the plan.

206
Part III: Before You Baseline 
	
✓	You’re analyzing the effect of a change to the project schedule (or 
another element of the project plan) that affects the project or product 
scope. You can set a different baseline to see the before-and-after effect 
of the change, though in this case you may prefer to reset the baseline. 
I discuss resetting the baseline in the later section “Clearing and resetting 
a baseline.”
The Set Baseline dialog box includes a list of these baselines, with a date 
stamp of the last date each was saved, as shown in Figure 14-2. When you 
save a baseline, you can save without overwriting an existing baseline 
by simply selecting another one of the baselines in this list before saving.
	
Figure 14-2: 
Multiple 
baseline 
options.
	
If you save multiple baselines or interim plans, you can view them by display­
ing columns in any sheet view for those plans. For example, if you want to 
display information for a baseline you saved with the name Baseline 7, you 
would insert the column named Baseline 7 into the Gantt Chart view sheet.
You can view multiple baselines at one time by displaying Multiple Baselines 
Gantt view.
	
When calculating variances (whether the schedule is early or late or costs are 
over or under budget), Project uses only the first baseline that’s saved (the 
one named Baseline, not Baseline1). If the project schedule and other parame­
ters change dramatically, such as when a project is delayed and later revived, 
you produce more valid variance data by clearing and resetting the baseline, 
as described in the later section “Clearing and resetting a baseline.”
	
The more baselines you save, the larger the Project file becomes and the more 
it can slow performance.

207
 Chapter 14: It All Begins with a Baseline
Clearing and resetting a baseline
A baseline is intended to be a frozen picture of the project plan that remains 
sacrosanct and never changes. Well, that’s the theory. In practice, events can 
make an original baseline less than useful — and even obsolete.
For example, if a project that spans four years from beginning to end, you 
may want to save a new baseline every year because costs increase or 
resources change. Then you can see incremental versions of the estimates 
that reflect the changes you made based on changes in the real world.
In contrast, a project that starts with a well-thought-out baseline plan can 
change a week later when the entire industry shuts down from a massive 
strike that lasts for three months. All original timing estimates then become 
bogus, so you would adjust the plan instead, save a new baseline, and move 
ahead after the strike is resolved.
To clear an existing baseline, follow these steps:
	
1.	To clear the baseline for only certain tasks, select them.
	
2.	Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline.
	
	 The Clear Baseline dialog box appears, with the Clear Baseline Plan 
option selected by default. 
	
3.	From the Clear Baseline Plan drop-down list, choose a baseline to 
clear, as shown in Figure 14-3.
	
Figure 14-3: 
Clearing the 
baseline or 
the interim 
plan.
	
	
4.	Select either the Entire Project radio button to clear the baseline for 
the entire project or the Selected Tasks radio button to clear selected 
tasks.
	
5.	Click the OK button.
	
	 The project baseline is cleared or selected tasks are cleared.

208
Part III: Before You Baseline 
In the Interim
An interim plan is sort of a “baseline light,” in which you save only the actual 
start and finish dates of tasks that have had activity tracked on them, as well 
as the baseline start and finish dates for all tasks that haven’t started.
An interim plan saves only timing information. If that’s all you need, all the 
data about resource assignments and costs, for example, aren’t saved. (When 
you save a large number of baselines, the Project file is huge. Saving an 
interim schedule makes the schedule less bulky.)
Because a baseline holds a great deal of data, the baseline can eventually 
become obsolete. An interim plan can be saved to record date changes but 
not overwrite the original baseline cost data.
Finally, you’re allowed to save as many as 11 baseline plans (the original base­
line plus baselines 1–10). If you need more than 11, consider using interim and 
some baseline data to expand the number of sets of data you can save.
	
Don’t go crazy for baselines and interim plans. Even in a long-term project, 
saving too many sets of plans can become confusing. To keep track of a plan 
when you save it, print a copy for your records, and note when and why the 
plan was saved.
Saving an interim plan
Interim plans and baselines are saved using the same dialog box. The differ­
ence is that you have to specify where the data in an interim plan originates. 
For example, if you want to save the start and finish dates from the Baseline2 
plan to the third interim plan, you copy from Baseline2 to Start/Finish3. If 
you want the current scheduled start and finish dates for all tasks, choose to 
copy from Start/Finish.
If you want to change currently scheduled start and finish dates in a baseline, 
but you don’t want to change all the other data that’s typically saved in a base­
line, you can copy from Start/Finish to the baseline plan that you want to change.
Follow these steps to save an interim plan:
	
1.	To save an interim plan for only certain tasks, select them.
	
2.	Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Set Baseline.
	
	 The Set Baseline dialog box appears.

209
 Chapter 14: It All Begins with a Baseline
	
3.	Select the Set Interim Plan radio button.
	
4.	From the Copy drop-down list box, select the set of data that you want 
to copy to the interim plan.
	
5.	From the Into drop-down list box, select the fields in which you want 
to store the interim plan data, as shown in Figure 14-4.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Copy set-
tings from 
any saved 
baseline to 
an interim 
plan.
	
	
6.	Select the appropriate radio buttons to save the plan for the entire 
project or selected tasks.
	
7.	If you choose to save the plan for selected tasks, use the check boxes 
to indicate how roll-up baseline options should work.
	
8.	Click the OK button to save the plan.
By using the Copy and Into fields in the Set Baseline dialog box, you can save 
as many as ten interim plans based on either baseline or actual data.
Clearing and resetting an interim plan
Ten interim plans may seem like a lot when you’re starting out in Project, 
but in the thick of a busy and ever-changing project, ten may fall short of the 
number you need. You may eventually need to clear one and resave it.

210

Project piggybacks baseline and interim plan settings, so you choose the 
Clear Baseline menu command to clear an interim plan.
To clear an interim plan, follow these steps:
	
1.	To clear only certain tasks in an interim plan, select them.
	
2.	Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline.
	
	 The Clear Baseline dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-5. You can 
use it to clear and reset interim plans as often as you like.

3.	Select the Clear Interim Plan option, and then, from the accompany­
ing list, choose the plan that you want to clear.
	
4.	Click to clear the specified interim plan for the entire project or for 
any tasks you’ve selected.
	
5.	Click the OK button to clear the plan.
You can now save a new set of information to that interim plan, if you like.
You may want to save a backup copy of various versions of the file with 
interim and baseline data. If you clear a baseline or an interim plan, its data 
disappears forever.

fter a project moves from the planning stage into action, it’s a continu­
ally changing game that features rules, goals, a general time frame — 
and chaos.
Whether a task happens as planned or wanders off in an unexpected direction, 
your job after the planning stage is to record what is happening. In other 
words, you’re tracking the progress. Tracking starts when team members 
report their progress on the project. Then you (or someone else assigned to 
tracking) record the progress of every task in Project.
When you track activity, you’ll be amazed at the data Project returns to you. 
Some of it’s good news, and some of it’s bad, but all of it’s useful in managing 
the project.
Developing a Communications 
Management Plan
When you’re planning a project, consider what information you (or any other 
stakeholder) need to track, who has the information, how it will be delivered, 
and how often it needs to be updated. Frequently, this information is stored 
in a separate document known as the communications management plan. 
Table 15-1 shows a simple example.

The communications management plan can be complex — or as simple as a 
Word table or an Excel spreadsheet. You enter the name or position of each 
stakeholder in the leftmost column, and then, across the top, enter the infor­
mation that’s needed, its method and frequency of delivery.
It isn’t rocket science, but you still have to determine up front which informa­
tion you might want to track, when you might want it, and in which form.
Gathering data
The first step in tracking progress on a project is to gather information about 
what’s been going on. The simpler it is to report progress on a project, the 
better, because people will do it. The more routine you can make the reporting — 
such as every Friday, on a specific form turned into the same person — the 
easier it is to gather data.
You can then input that information into Project in several ways: Use various 
views and tables to enter information in sheets of data, enter information in 
the Task Information dialog box, or use the tracking tools in the Schedule 
group of the Task tab on the Ribbon.
The amount of data you collect is determined by the information you need 
to track and the level of detail. For example, some people use Project only to 
create a timeline for their activities. Others use resources and track their total 
work on tasks, just not to the level of detail that scrutinizes hourly work per­
formed. For some people, simply marking one task 50% complete and another 
100% complete — and letting Project assume that all resources completed 
their estimated amounts of work — is fine.
Applying a tracking method
You have to identify the best tracking method for you, which is determined 
by the amount and type of information you need to monitor. Microsoft pro­
vides four tracking methods in Project 2013:

215
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
	
✓	Task – total
	
✓	Task – time phased
	
✓	Assignment – total
	
✓	Assignment – time phased
I guide you throughout the rest of this chapter, but you can begin to under­
stand these methods by comparing task tracking and assignment tracking. 
You can track information by task, indicating to the present time (or a status 
date you select) the total work completed or costs for the task. Or you can 
track information by assignment, which is a more detailed tracking that 
shows you the total work completed or costs by each resource.
Suppose that the Test Electrical Components task is estimated to take 12 
hours of work, according to the project baseline. An Engineer, Electrician, 
and Assistant — three human resources — are assigned at 100% of their time. 
Tracking by task – total, you can simply note that the task is 75% complete, 
which translates into nine hours of work finished.
Project assumes that the three resources split the work equally — three 
hours for each resource. In reality, however, the Engineer spent one hour, 
the Electrician spent six, and the Assistant spent two. Therefore, the time 
phased variable enters the picture. Time-phased tracking uses specific time 
increments, whether you choose to track work by task or work completed by 
individual resources on the task.
So in the Test Electrical Components task, you can use the task – time phased 
approach to track the nine hours on a daily basis. Or you can use the assign­
ment – time phased approach to track each resource’s work, hourly or daily.
	
If the project or organization doesn’t require detailed assignment or time-
phased tracking, you’re better off using the task – total method. Then you can 
spend less time entering information into Project and more time managing the 
team and the stakeholders.
Using the tracking tools
Sometimes, it seems that Project provides a handy button for everything you 
need to do on a project, so why should tracking be any different? The track­
ing tools at the top of the Schedule group on the Task tab perform updates 
on selected tasks in any sheet view. Figure 15-1 shows the tracking tools and 
other buttons in the Schedule group.

216
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 15-1: 
The tracking 
buttons.
	
These tools make specific updates to selected tasks:
	
✓	Percent Complete: Click this tool to quickly mark a task’s progress using 
a calculation of the percentage (from 0% to 100%) of hours of work 
completed.
	
✓	Mark on Track: Selecting a task and clicking this tool records activity 
automatically to the status date as you scheduled it in the baseline. 
(See the later section “Specifying the status date” to set a status date.)
	
✓	Update Tasks: To display a dialog box that contains tracking information 
about the progress, duration, start, and finish dates, find this tool on the 
menu that opens when you click the down arrow on the Mark on Track 
button. For example, you can indicate whether a task’s actual start date 
varied from its current start date. Figure 15-2 shows the Update Tasks 
dialog box.

The Update 
Tasks dialog 
box.
	
You can use a few more tools, found elsewhere in Project, to track and illus­
trate progress:
	
✓	Update Project: Mark all tasks in a project as complete to a specific 
status date. You can also use this tool to reschedule uncompleted work. 
The section “Update Project: Sweeping Changes,” later in this chapter, 
explains how to perform overall updates.
	
✓	Move Task: Reschedule all or part of a selected task. You can use this 
tool, found in the Tasks group on the Task tab on the Ribbon, to move 
a task forward or backward or to reschedule parts of it by the status 
date. The “Moving a Task” section, later in this chapter, explains how 
to use this tool.

217
Chapter 15: On the Right Track	
✓	Add Progress Line: Turn on a type of drawing tool. On the Format tab, 
in the Format group, choose Gridlines. Click the down arrow and select 
Progress Lines. A dialog box appears so that you can, at particular dates, 
set up progress lines: They indicate which tasks are ahead of or behind 
schedule by way of a vertical line that connects in-progress tasks.
For everything, there’s a view
You may already know that Project has a view for everything you want to do. 
For example, you can use Task Sheet view and Task Usage view (as shown in 
Figures 15-3 and 15-4, respectively) to easily update either task or resource 
information. So many variations are available that you may believe Microsoft 
charges by the view.
Depending on the tracking method you need (see the section “Applying a 
tracking method,” earlier in this chapter), different views serve different pur­
poses. Table 15-2 specifies the best view to use for each tracking method.

When you find the appropriate view with the correct columns displayed, 
entering tracking information is as simple as typing a number of hours, a 
dollar amount for fixed costs, or a start or finish date in the appropriate 
column for the task you’re updating.
Tracking Work for the Record
To track progress on a project, you enter several types of information. First, 
you tell Project as of when you want to track progress: By default, it records 
information as of the current date based on your computer’s date-and-time 
settings. However, if you want to record progress as of, say, the end of the 
company’s quarter, you can do that, too.

219
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
You can record the actual start and finish dates of a task, the percent com­
plete (for example, 75% complete), and the actual work performed (the 
number of hours that resources spent on each task). If you believe that the 
task will take less or more time than you anticipated, based on progress to 
date, you can modify the remaining duration of the task. You can also enter 
units of materials used and fixed-cost information for expenditures incurred, 
such as equipment rental or consulting fees.
Specifying the status date
If you don’t know the day of the week, you can’t very well gauge whether 
you’re making headway on the week’s work. Tracking is like that: First, estab­
lish the status date, or the date as of which you’re tracking progress.
By default, Project uses the date-and-time setting on your computer as the 
date for entering actual activity information. However, sometimes you want to 
time-travel. Suppose that the boss asks for a report showing the status of the 
project as of the last day of the quarter, December 31. You’ve gathered time 
sheets from all resources through that date, but you didn’t enter those updates 
into Project until three days after the quarter ended. You can set the status date 
in Project to December 31 and then enter the tracking data. Even better, certain 
automated tracking tools work along with the status date. For example, if you 
know that all tasks in the project were on schedule as of the status date, use 
the Update Project tool to mark all scheduled work as complete up to that date.
After you set the status date and enter information, Project uses that date to 
calculate earned value, which is the value of work completed to date. Also, 
any task-complete or percent-complete information records as of that date 
and progress lines in the chart area reflect that timing. Any reports or print­
outs of views that you generate paint a picture of the status of the project as 
of that date.
Here’s how to set the status date:
	
1.	Select the Project tab and then click the calendar in the Status group 
of the tab.
	
2.	Click the Status Date button and then click the down arrow to display 
the calendar.
	
3.	If you want to set the status date in another month, click the right or 
left arrow in the upper-right corner of the calendar to navigate to that 
month.
	
4.	Click the date you want.
	
5.	Click the OK button.
Now you’re ready to start entering tracking data.

220
Part IV: Staying on Track 
Remaining on track
When you’re determining the project status, and you find that a task was, 
or will be, on schedule as of the status date, you can use a new, easy-to-use 
tool to mark the task as partially complete through the status date. Project 
assumes an even distribution of work over time and calculates the percent­
age complete as of the status date. It then marks the percent complete 
accordingly. To use this tool, simply select tasks to update and click the 
Mark on Track button in the Schedule group on the Task tab.
	
To track a project so that you can glance at any task and determine its prog­
ress, insert a column labeled % Complete. To insert the column, simply right-
click a column head and choose Insert Column➪Select % Complete.
Determining the percent complete
When I’m asked how to determine whether a task is 25%, 50%, or even 36.5% 
complete, I usually refer people to their own intuition. If the boss asks you 
how that report is coming along, you typically make a quick, internal calcula­
tion and supply a rough estimate. A rough estimate, based on your experi­
ence and the information your resources provide about their progress, is 
often good enough.
You can also calculate the percent complete in more precise ways. For 
example, if you estimate that a task should take ten hours of effort, and your 
resources report performing five hours of effort, you can say that the task is 
50% complete. Be careful, though: Just because people have spent half the 
allocated time doesn’t mean that they have accomplished half the work.
Cost is another way to estimate the percent complete: If you originally esti­
mated that four resources assigned to a four-day task would tally $4,000 in 
costs, and the total time that the resources report spending on the task is 
$3,000, you can guess that the task is 75% finished. But again, just because 
you’ve spent three quarters of the money doesn’t mean that you’ve accom­
plished three quarters of what you set out to do.
Determining the percentage of work that’s done is easier when the deliver­
able is measurable. For example, if your task is to produce 100 cars on the 
assembly line in four days, and you’ve produced 25 cars, the task may be 
about 25% finished. Or if you were supposed to install software on ten com­
puters in a computer lab, and the installation is complete on five of them, 
that’s an easy 50% estimate.

221
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
But not every task can be calculated as neatly. If you know it’ll be hard to 
gauge the percent complete when you’re in the planning phase, collaborate 
with the team member on the interim measurements to allocate 25%, 50%, 
75%, and 100% complete. For example, if you want to determine interim mea­
surements for the three-week task Develop Medical Protocols, you might 
agree that when a complete list of protocols is needed and they’ve been 
assigned to development, the task is 25% complete. When 50% are drafted, 
the task is 50% complete. When the protocols are 100% drafted, the task is 
75% complete. When the list has been edited and someone in charge has 
signed off on it and approved it, the task is 100% complete.
	
To avoid finding out (usually, at the last minute) that a team member’s version 
of “almost complete” is significantly different from yours, agree up front that 
you’ll sign off on 75% complete only after specific criteria are met.
Here’s the simplest and quickest way to update the percent complete on a task: 
Click the task name to select it in any task-related view and then click the 0%, 
25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% button on the Task tab. Alternatively, you can double-
click any task to open the Task Information dialog box and then enter the per­
cent complete value on the General tab there. You can also select a task, open 
the Mark on Track drop-down list, and click Update Tasks to open the Update 
Tasks dialog box and make the change there. If you want to enter a percentage 
in increments other than 25%, you’ll have to enter it in the Task Information or 
Update Tasks dialog box or the % Complete column in any sheet view.
Recording start and finish information
If you note that a task is complete, and you don’t enter the actual start date, 
Project (ever the optimist) assumes that you started on time. If you didn’t 
Don’t let tracking become too detailed
Does it make sense to track 2.25% of progress 
every other day on a two-month task? Probably 
not. Except on the lengthiest tasks, entering a 
percent complete that’s more specific than 25, 
50, 75, or 100 probably isn’t worth the trouble. 
That’s partly because multiweek tasks can 
often be divided into subtasks for ease of track­
ing and partly because reporting is one purpose 
of tracking. If your boss or board of directors or 
client couldn’t care less about reaching exactly 
33.75% complete, you shouldn’t care, either.
On the other hand, if the project must include (for 
a reason known only to you) a six-month task and 
you can’t break it into subtasks, you may use per­
centages such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and so on to 
prevent having to wait a month between updates 
with (apparently) no progress to show.

222
Part IV: Staying on Track 
start on time, and you want to reflect the actual timing, modify the actual start 
date; if you finished late, enter the actual finish date. However, if you don’t 
modify the task duration, and you enter an earlier finish date, be aware that 
the start date is calculated to have occurred earlier.
You have two options to track this information:
	
✓	Use the Update Tasks dialog box. To open it (refer to Figure 15-2), click 
the Mark on Track button in the Schedule group on the Task tab.
	
✓	Display a sheet view with Actual Start and Actual Finish columns 
(such as Tracking Gantt or Gantt Chart view) with the Tracking table 
displayed. Then use the drop-down calendar in the Actual Start or 
Actual Finish column to specify a date. If you need to change the actual 
start date, you must mark the task as partially complete first. When you 
need to change both the Actual Start and Actual Finish dates, mark the 
task as 100% complete before specifying the dates.
	
A few conditions can cause a warning message to appear when you enter 
an actual start date or finish date — for example, when the actual start date 
precedes the start date of the project or when the actual start date causes a 
conflict with a dependent task. When this warning message appears, you have 
these options:
	
✓	Cancel the operation.
	
✓	Allow the conflict to exist (or the task to start) before the project starts.
To cancel the change, correct the problem (for example, by modifying the 
project start date), and then go back and enter the actual information. Or you 
can force the conflict and let it stand.
Knowing what to do when John works 
three hours and Mary works ten
To get to the blow-by-blow level of tracking, you record exactly how many 
hours each resource spends on tasks. This process can be about as much 
fun as typing all the names in the New York City phone book into a database, 
but it has certain benefits: After you track the number of actual hours, you 
can produce tallies of the total hours each resource invests in the project by 
day, week, or month. If you have to bill clients based on resource hours (for 
example, contract work by the hour), you have a clear record to refer to. If 
you’re tracking a budget in detail, multiplying resource hours by their indi­
vidual rates provides an accurate accounting of costs as finely as computing 
them day by day.

223
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
If you don’t enter specific hours, Project simply calculates the hours of work 
completed on the task as a percentage of the total hours assigned. It assumes 
that every person assigned to the task has completed the same percentage 
of work. For many people, this strategy works well; other people need more 
detail. If you’re in the detail camp, specify actual resource hours as a total by 
task or day by day through the life of each task.
To enter resource hours, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Task Usage view.
	
2.	Scroll down to locate the task that you want to track and its resource 
assignments.
	
	 Each assigned resource is listed on a separate row underneath the task 
name.
	
3.	Enter the number of hours completed by the resource:
 
• To enter only total hours: Insert the Actual Work column into the 
sheet by right-clicking a column, choosing Insert Column, and 
selecting the Actual Work column. Enter total hours in the newly 
displayed column.
 
• To enter hours on the task day by day: Right-click the chart pane 
and then choose Actual Work to display the row labeled Act. Work. 
Figure 15-5 shows this row in Task Usage view. Click the Act. Work 
cell on a day on which the resource worked, and enter a number. 
Repeat this step for every day that the resource worked on the task.
	
Figure 15-5: 
Track 
resource 
activity day 
by day in 
this view.
	

224
Part IV: Staying on Track 
If the hours you enter for a resource total more or less than the baseline 
estimate for that resource on that task, here’s what happens:
	
✓	When you enter an amount in the Act. Work row and press Enter, the 
Actual Work column total recalculates to reflect the total number of 
hours worked on that task.
	
✓	A little pencil symbol appears in the ID column for that task, indicating 
that the assignment has been edited.
	
✓	A Person icon appears in the Indicators column to the left of the task 
name, indicating a resource overallocation.
You can change the entries in the Work column or the time-phased work row 
for a task or an assignment. If you do so, Project changes the task schedule 
accordingly. Then, if you mark actual work, it’s tracked compared with the 
edited working hours.
	
To easily look up the total hours spent by each resource on the project, 
check the summary number of work hours listed next to the resource in the 
Resource Name column in Resource Usage view. This view is another handy 
way to track assignments.
Uh-oh — we’re in overtime
When you enter 16 hours of work in a single day for a resource, even though 
the resource’s availability is based on a calendar with an 8-hour day, Project 
doesn’t recognize those hours as overtime. It’s one instance of having to lead 
Project by the hand and tell it to specify overtime work.
When you enter hours in the Overtime Work field, Project interprets them as 
the number of total work hours that are overtime hours. So if you enter 16 
hours of work on a task in the Work column and then enter 4 in the Overtime 
Work column, Project assumes 12 hours of work at the standard resource 
rate and 4 hours at the overtime rate.
To enter overtime hours, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Usage view.
	
2.	Right-click a column heading and choose Insert Column.
	
	 The list of columns appears.
	
3.	Select Overtime Work in the list.
	
4.	Click in the Overtime Work column for a specific assignment for a 
resource and then click the spinner arrows to specify the overtime 
hours.

225
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
If you specify overtime, Project assumes that effort-driven tasks have a 
shorter duration. After all, if the task were to take three 8-hour days (24 
hours of work) to complete, and you recorded the resource working 12 hours 
for two days in a row, Project figures that all the effort was accomplished in 
less time. The duration of the task shrinks. If that’s not what happened, you 
have to manually modify the task duration.
Specifying remaining durations 
for auto-scheduled tasks
Tracking information for auto-scheduled tasks has a weird and wonderful 
relationship in Project. For example, Project tries to help you by calculating 
the duration based on other entries you make, such as actual start dates and 
finish dates. In that particular case, Project calculates task duration accord­
ing to those dates. (This process works in reverse, too: If you enter the task 
duration, Project recalculates the finish date to reflect it.)
You may instead want to enter the duration yourself. For example, if you 
have entered a start date and 20 hours of work on a task that has a baseline 
of 16 hours of work, Project can’t comprehend that the scope of the task has 
changed, and that now the task is incomplete and requires another 20 hours 
of work. You have to tell Project about it.
To modify the duration of a task either in progress or completed, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Choose View➪Tables➪Tracking.
	
	 The Tracking table is displayed, as shown in Figure 15-6.
	
3.	Click in the Actual Duration column of the task you want to modify 
and then use the arrows to adjust the actual duration up or down.
	
4.	If you want to enter a remaining duration, click in the Rem. Dur. 
(Remaining Duration) column, and type a number and an increment 
symbol.
	
	 For example, you may type 25d (where d is the increment symbol for 
days). If the remaining duration is greater than the original estimate 
and the task is on the critical path, Project warns you that the task is 
linked to a task constraint or linked to a task that can’t move. You can 
either continue and allow the scheduling conflict or cancel and allow the 
scheduling conflict.

226
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 15-6:

Chart, with 
Tracking 
table.
	
	
If you enter the percent complete for a task and then modify the duration to 
differ from the baseline, Project automatically recalculates the percent com­
plete to reflect the new duration. For example, if you enter 50% complete on a 
10-hour task and then modify the actual duration to 20 hours, Project consid­
ers those 5 hours (50% of 10 hours) being only 25% of the 20 hours.
Entering fixed-cost updates
Fixed costs are costs that aren’t influenced by time, such as equipment pur­
chases and consulting fees. Compared with the calculations and interactions 
of the percent completes and the start and finish dates for hourly resources, 
fixed-cost tracking will seem like simplicity itself!
Here’s how to track fixed costs:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Choose View➪Tables➪Cost.
	
	 The Cost table is displayed.
	
3.	Click in the Fixed Cost column for the task you want to update.
	
4.	Type the fixed cost, or a total of several fixed costs, for the task.
That’s it! However, because Project lets you enter only one fixed-cost amount 
per task, consider adding a note to the task to itemize the costs you’ve 
included in the total.

227
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
	
The fixed cost assigned to the task is only the scheduled cost for the task. For 
this cost to become the planned cost, the task has to be baselined. Also, 
updates to the % Complete column update actual costs, depending on the 
accrual method that’s selected for the task: Prorated is the default setting, but 
the start and finish dates of the task also influence the actual costs when the 
percent complete is applied.
	
Consider using some of the ten customizable Cost columns for itemized fixed-
cost entry. Rename one Equipment Purchase, and another Facility Rental, for 
example, and then enter the costs in those columns. Of course, these columns 
of data may not perform calculations such as rolling up total costs to the 
summary tasks in the project, but they serve as reminders about itemized 
fixed costs.
	
In Project 2013, you can designate a resource type as a cost and assign a cost 
every time you assign the resource. The Cost column calculation of total cost 
includes the amount spent for cost resources on tasks. See Chapter 7 for more 
about resource types.
Moving a Task
If you’ve ever managed the subcontractors on any type of construction proj­
ect, you’ve probably heard these dreaded words: “My current job is running 
long, so I’ll get to your job in about a week.” What you’d rather hear from a 
subcontractor (or any other type of resource) is this: “My schedule opened up, 
so I can start work on this assignment a week early.” Project helps you easily 
reschedule an entire task or reschedule part of a task as of the status date.
Here’s how to use the Move Task tool to move a task:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	If the task is partially complete and you want to move its uncompleted 
portion, select the Project tab and set a status date.
	
3.	Select the task to move.
	
4.	Click the Move Task button in the Tasks group on the Task tab.
	
	 The choices for rescheduling the task appear, as shown in Figure 15-7.

228
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 15-7: 
Moving a 
task.
	
	
5.	Specify how to move the task:
 
• To move the task forward or back by a default amount: Click 1 Day, 
1 Week, or 4 Weeks in either the Move Task Forward or Move Task 
Back section.
 
• To move the task by a custom time frame: Click the appropriate 
Custom option, specify the number of working days by which to 
move the task in the dialog box that appears, and click the OK 
button.
 
• To reschedule part of the task according to the status date: Choose 
the Incomplete Parts to Status Date option to split the task and 
move the uncompleted portion to resume later, starting on the 
status date. Choose the Completed Parts to Status Date option 
to split the task and move the completed portion earlier, before 
the status date.
 
• To reschedule the task based on the availability of the assigned 
resources: Choose the appropriate Custom option, specify the 
number of working days by which to move the task in the dialog 
box that appears, and click OK.
When you’re moving a task that’s auto-scheduled, a constraint is applied, to 
honor the newly scheduled task. Be aware that constraints apply restrictions 
to task scheduling and can make it challenging to manage the dates.

 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
Update Project: Sweeping Changes
If it’s been a while since you tracked activity, and you want to update the 
schedule, Update Project may be for you. This feature lets you track chunks 
of activity for specified periods. Update Project works best, however, if most 
tasks have been completed on schedule.
This type of tracking isn’t finely tuned: It’s similar to recording in your check­
book the balance that the bank sends in your mailed statement rather than 
accounting for your balance check by check. Doing so assumes that all your 
checks and deposits align with the bank’s version as of that date; therefore, 
going forward, you’re back on track.
Here are the settings options that Update Project offers you:
	
✓	Update Work As Complete Through: You can update the project in one of 
two ways through the status date you specify in this box. The Set 0% – 100% 
Complete setting lets Project calculate the percent complete on every 
task that should have begun by that time. By choosing this option, you 
tell Project to assume that the tasks started and progressed exactly on 
time. The Set 0% or 100% Complete Only setting works a little differently: It 
tells Project to record 100% complete on tasks that the baseline indicated 
would be complete by now and to leave all other tasks at 0% complete.
	
✓	Reschedule Uncompleted Work to Start After: This setting reschedules 
the portions of tasks that aren’t yet complete to start after the specified 
date.
To use Update Project, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	To update only certain tasks, select them.
	
3.	Choose Project➪Update Project.
	
	 The Update Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-8.
	
Figure 15-8: 
You can 
update only 
selected 
tasks or the 
entire 
project.
	

230
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
4.	Choose the update method you prefer: Set 0% – 100% Complete or Set 
0% or 100% Complete Only.
	
5.	If you want a status date other than the one shown or you didn’t previ­
ously set one, set the date to use in the field in the upper-right corner.
	
6.	If you want Project to reschedule any work rather than update work 
as complete, select the Reschedule Uncompleted Work to Start After 
option and then select a date from the list.
	
7.	Choose whether you want these changes to apply to the entire project 
or to only selected tasks.
	
8.	Click the OK button to save the settings and have Project make updates.
If you want, you can use Update Project to make certain global changes, such 
as to mark as 100% complete all tasks that should be complete according to 
the baseline. Then you perform more detailed task-by-task tracking on indi­
vidual tasks that are only partially complete.
Tracking Materials
Tracking the amount of materials used on tasks involves tracking actual units 
at the level of material resources. If you create a resource named Rubber and 
assign it to the Manufacture Tires task at 500 tons, for example, and then you 
use only 450 tons, you enter the actual units used.
This situation resembles the way you track work resource hours on tasks. To 
make it happen, simply follow these steps:
	
1.	Display Resource Usage view.
	
2.	Locate the material resource in the list, and under the resource name, 
double-click the assignment for which you want to enter the actual units.
	
	 The Assignment Information dialog box appears (see Figure 15-9).
	
Figure 15-9: 
You can 
use the 
Assignment 
Information 
dialog box 
to enter 
actuals, too.
	

231
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
	
3.	Click the Tracking tab.
	
4.	Enter the actual units used in the Actual Work field.
	
5.	Click the OK button.
If you need to enter actual units for multiple assignments, you can use the 
method I describe in the earlier section “Knowing what to do when John 
works three hours and Mary works ten.” Right-click the right side of the view 
and choose Actual Work to display the row labeled Act. Work. You can then 
plug in the actual data. If you assign the material resource of 500 tons to a 
five-day task, for example, remember that Resource Usage view shows Project 
spreading out the usage — 100 tons for each of the five days of the task. If you 
don’t care on which day the materials were used, you can simply increase or 
decrease one setting to make up for any difference in actual usage.
Tracking More Than One: 
Consolidated Projects
Often, projects are related in some fashion (such as sharing resources or 
having timing dependencies between them), or a series of smaller projects 
make up a larger program. In such a case, you can consolidate these separate 
projects into one file, either as a series of summary tasks or with all summary 
tasks and subtasks included.
When you consolidate projects, you can choose to link to the source file. When 
you do, any changes to the source file are represented and updated in the 
consolidated file.
If it’s your job to keep track of the big picture, you have to understand how 
consolidated projects are updated, as I describe in the following section.
Consolidating projects
Creating a consolidated project is similar to eating at a buffet — you add one 
item from the salads, one from the sides, and so on — until you build yourself 
a tasty meal. In Project, you open a blank file and then insert existing projects 
to build a satisfying master project schedule.
The neat thing about consolidated projects is that you have some choices 
about the interaction between the consolidated project and the source files 
you insert in it. For example, you can link to a source file so that changes 
made in the source file are reflected in the consolidated project. This capa­
bility is helpful for a project manager who has to keep her eye on multiple 
phases or many smaller projects.

232
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
You can also create dependencies between inserted projects in the consoli­
dated file. If you have, for example, one project that can’t start until another 
one finishes, you can clearly see in the consolidated file how various separate 
projects in your organization affect each other.
Another way to relate consolidated projects to their source files is to make 
the consolidated project a two-way street, allowing changes in it to be 
reflected in the source files. You can also make the source files read-only so 
that no changes can affect other people’s files.
To create a consolidated file, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open a blank Project file and display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Click anywhere in the Task Name column.
	
	 If you’re inserting multiple projects, click the row in which you want the 
inserted file (or files) to appear. If you want to insert a project between 
existing tasks, click the task beneath the spot where you want the proj­
ect to be inserted.
	
3.	Choose Project➪Subproject in the Insert group.
	
	 The Insert Project dialog box, shown in Figure 15-10, appears.
	
4.	Using the navigation pane and file list, locate the Project file that you 
want to insert, and select it.
	
5.	(Optional) Click the down arrow on the Insert button if you want to 
change the default setting to Insert Read Only.
	
Figure 15-10: 
The Insert 
Project  
dialog box.
	

233
 Chapter 15: On the Right Track
	
6.	If you want to link the project in this file to the source file so that 
the consolidated file is updated automatically whenever you open it, 
ensure that the Link to Project check box is selected.
	
7.	Click the OK button.
	
	 The project is inserted into the file, with the summary task showing and 
all subtasks hidden. To display all tasks in the inserted project, simply 
click the plus sign to the left of the summary task.
	
If you want to insert multiple subprojects, leave them all collapsed. This strat­
egy ensures that they’re all inserted at the topmost level of the outline in the 
consolidated project.
Updating consolidated projects
You have two ways to skin the cat known as “updating a consolidated project,” 
and the one you use depends on whether you linked to the source files when 
you inserted them. If you linked the files and inserted them without using the 
read-only setting, changes in source files are reflected in the consolidated 
file (and vice versa). Updating is simply a matter of ensuring that all files are 
available in their original linked locations (for example, in a folder on the 
network); then Project updates automatically.
If you haven’t linked the files, changes in source files aren’t reflected in con­
solidated files, and the consolidated file information doesn’t affect the source 
information. You may create this type of unlinked consolidated file if you 
simply want to see a snapshot of how all projects are progressing and don’t 
want to run the risk of your settings changing the source information. In this 
case, however, if you want to track progress, you have to create a new con­
solidated project or enter all updates manually.
	
After you insert projects in a file, you can move them around by using the Cut 
and Paste tools. When you do, message windows may appear, offering you 
options to resolve any conflicts that may occur because of dependency links 
you’ve created between inserted projects.
Changing linking settings
Changing your mind is a project manager’s prerogative. If you’ve inserted a 
source file into a consolidated file, and you find that you didn’t initially estab­
lish a link, you can change that setting so that the files update each other 
automatically.

234
Part IV: Staying on Track 
Follow these steps to make changes to the inserted project:
	
1.	Open the consolidated file.
	
2.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
3.	Double-click the task name of the inserted project that you want to 
update.
	
	 The Inserted Project Information dialog box appears.
	
4.	Click the Advanced tab.
	
5.	Select the Link to Project check box and then click the Browse button.
	
	 The Inserted Project dialog box appears.
	
6.	Use the Look In feature to locate the file that you want to link to and 
then select the file.
	
7.	Click the OK button.
	
8.	If you want the source file to be read-only, select the Insert Read-Only 
option from the drop-down menu.
	
9.	Click OK to save the link.

ome project managers use Project simply to paint a picture all the effort 
that their project will entail and then stash the plan in a drawer. That’s 
a mistake. After you enter all the project data, save a baseline, and then track 
actual activity on the project, you receive in return an amazing array of infor­
mation from Project that can help you stay on time and on budget.
After you track some actual activity on several tasks, Project lets you view 
baseline estimates alongside the real-time plan. Project alerts you to tasks 
that are running late and also shows how the critical path shifts over time. To 
read about the critical path, review Chapter 12.
Project also provides detailed performance information. In fact, the information 
you can see about the cost and schedule performance can be quite robust. 
You can produce a simple cost-and-schedule variance, or you can use more 
complex metrics, such as a cost performance index using earned-value manage­
ment techniques. I discuss this particular measurement technique in the later 
section “Tracking Progress Using Earned Value Management.”
Keep the project file close at hand — and take a look at how Project can 
make you the most informed project manager in town.

236
Part IV: Staying on Track 
Seeing Where Tasks Stand
You’ve diligently entered resource work hours on tasks, recorded the prog­
ress on tasks, and entered fixed costs. Now what? Well, all that information 
has initiated several calculations and updates to the project schedule. It’s 
time to take a quick look at the changes that all this tracking has produced in 
the project schedule.
	
A check mark in the Indicator field tells you that a task is complete. If you see 
an unfamiliar indicator icon crop up in the project, hold the mouse pointer 
over the indicator. A text box opens and describes its meaning. To see a list of 
Project icons and their meanings, go to Help and type indicators in the Search 
box. Click Search and then click Indicator Fields.
Baseline versus actual progress
One obvious way to view the difference between a baseline estimate and 
the progress you’ve tracked in the project is by using a task bar. After you 
track progress on several tasks, the Gantt chart shows a black bar superim­
posed on the baseline task bar. For example, in Figure 16-1, Tasks 58–64 are 
complete; you can tell by the solid black bar that extends the full length of 
the task bar. Task 65 is only partially complete; the black line that indicates 
actual progress only partially fills the duration for the task. Task 66 has no 
recorded activity on it; you see no black line indicating progress — only the 
normal task bar.
Lines of progress
Progress lines offer additional visual indicators of how you’re doing (refer 
to Chapter 15). As you can see in Figure 16-2, a progress line zigzags among 
tasks and forms, showing left- or right-pointing peaks. These peaks indicate 
late or early tasks (calculated according to the status date you set for track­
ing or another date that you specify). A progress line that points to the left of 
a task indicates that the task is running late. Progress lines that point to the 
right show that — wonder of wonders — you’re running ahead of schedule. 
(Treasure these lines: They don’t seem to appear often in projects.)

238
Part IV: Staying on Track 
In Figure 16-2, progress is measured as of the baseline date. You can see that 
the tasks under the summary tasks Finish Line Food and Finish Line Beverage 
are running behind, because the line points to the left. The tasks for Water 
Stations are ahead of schedule, as indicated by the line pointing to the right.
Displaying progress lines
By default, Project doesn’t display progress lines. You have to turn them on. 
And while you’re at it, you may as well specify when and how they appear. 
Here’s how to display progress lines and change their settings:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Right-click the chart portion of the view and choose Progress Lines.
	
	 The Progress Lines dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-3.
	
Figure 16-3: 
The 
Progress 
Lines dialog 
box.
	
	
3.	If you want Project to always show a progress line for the current or 
status date, select the Display check box in the Current Progress Line 
section and then select At Project Status Date or At Current Date.
	
4.	If you want progress lines to be displayed at set intervals, do this:
	
a.	Select the Display Progress Lines check box in the Recurring Intervals 
section and then select Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
	
b.	Specify the interval settings.
	
	For example, if you select Weekly, you can choose every week, 
every other week, and so on, as well as for which day of the week 
the line should be displayed on the timescale.

239
 Chapter 16: Project Views: Observing Progress
	
5.	Choose whether you want to display progress lines beginning at the 
Project start date or on another date.
	
	 To use the Project start date, simply select the Project Start option in 
the Begin At section of the dialog box. To select an alternative start date, 
select the second option and then select a date from the calendar drop-
down list.
	
6.	If you want to display a progress line on a specific date, select the 
Display check box in the Selected Progress Lines section and then 
choose a date from the Progress Line Dates drop-down calendar.
	
	 You can make this setting for multiple dates by clicking subsequent lines 
in this list and selecting additional dates.
	
	You can choose to display progress lines in relation to actual or baseline 
information.
	
	 If a task has been tracked to show 50 percent complete, for example, and 
you choose to have Project display progress lines based on actual infor­
mation, the peak appears relative to the 50 percent actual line, not to the 
complete baseline task bar.
	
7.	Click the OK button to save these settings.
Formatting progress lines
In keeping with the almost mind-boggling array of formatting options that 
Project makes available to you, you can modify how progress lines are for­
matted.
As with any changes to formatting, you’re tampering with the way Project 
codes visual information for readers. Be cautious about making formatting 
changes that cause the plan to be difficult to read for those who are accus­
tomed to the default Project formatting.
To modify progress-line formatting:
	
1.	Display Gantt Chart view.
	
2.	Right-click the chart portion of the view and choose Progress Lines.
	
	 The Progress Lines dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-3).
	
3.	Select the Line Styles tab.
	
	 You see the display options shown in Figure 16-4.

240
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 16-4: 
Progress 
line styles.
	
	
4.	In the Progress Line Type area, select a line style sample.
	
5.	In the Line Type fields, select a style from the samples.
	
	 You can make two settings: one for the current progress line and one for 
all other progress lines.
	
6.	You can change the line color, progress point shape, and progress 
point color by making different choices in those boxes.
	
7.	If you want a date to appear alongside each progress line, select the 
Show Date for Each Progress Line check box and then select a date 
from the Format field.
	
8.	If you want to change the font that’s used for the displayed date, click 
the Change Font button and make the changes.
	
9.	Click the OK button to save these settings.
Delving into the Detail
Visual indicators such as task bars and indicator icons are useful to alert you 
to delays or variances between estimated and actual performance, but they 
don’t provide detailed information. To get the lowdown on how far ahead (or 
behind) you are, down to the day or penny, scan the numbers. The numbers 
that Project provides reveal much about whether you’re on schedule and 
within the budget.
One way to view variances is to show Tracking Gantt view. From the Task 
tab, go to the View section on the far left side and click the down arrow. 

241
 Chapter 16: Project Views: Observing Progress
Choose Tracking Gantt. This view has, by default, two thin task bars for each 
task. The gray bar at the bottom shows the baseline, whereas the top bar 
shows the current (scheduled) or actual (tracked) schedule. The color of the 
top bar varies, depending on whether it’s a critical task if it’s auto-scheduled 
or a manually scheduled task. As shown in Figure 16-5, in Tracking Gantt 
view, you can show and tell exactly where a project went off track or picked 
up steam.
Two tables that you can display in Gantt Chart view bring the options into 
focus. The Cost table and Variance table provide information about dollars 
spent and variations in timing between baseline and actual activity.
	
To display a table, choose View➪Data Group➪Tables and click the table 
name. Another option is to place the pointer on the blank square immediately 
above row 1 and to the left of the first column. Then right-click the mouse to 
display the available tables for easy selection.
In the Cost table shown in Figure 16-6, you can review data that compares 
baseline estimates of fixed costs and actual costs. These two sets of data are 
presented side by side in columns. In the project shown in the figure, the 
current total cost based on tracked information is $94,499, and the baseline 
estimate is $91,283, for a variance of $3,216 over the budget.
	
Figure 16-5: 
Tracking 
Gantt view.
	

242
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 16-6: 
Cost table.
	
For the Cost table, a variance that’s positive indicates that you’ve spent more 
than expected. A variance that’s negative indicates that you’re under budget.
	
Project assumes that the remaining costs will remain at the budgeted amount. 
In other words, from the total budgeted amount for the work, it assumes that 
the remaining work will be completed on budget, and it adds the actual costs 
to date to produce the total cost. Rarely do future estimates end on budget 
when the work to date is in a cost-overrun situation, so don’t rely on the infor­
mation in the Total Cost column.
In Figure 16-7, the Variance table shows whether the schedule is on track 
or has variances (much like the Cost table shows cost variances). The table 
shows the variance between baseline start and finish dates and task dura­
tions, as well as the timing that occurred on tasks after the project was under 
way. Notice in the example that all the tasks in the Define Route section were 
delayed by two days.
	
If you created contingency reserve to help handle unexpected delays, the total 
variance shown in the Variance table tells you how many days you may have 
to deduct from the contingency duration to get back on track. You can read 
more in Chapter 17 about making adjustments for delays and cost overruns 
and about contingency reserve in Chapter 12.

Tracking Progress Using Earned 
Value Management
On large projects, especially large government projects, project managers are 
required to track progress using the earned value management (EVM) method. 
I won’t bore you with a detailed discussion of EVM, but you should become 
familiar with some of the most common terms and calculations surrounding 
this concept because many organizations require information on these specific 
numbers in project reports. Some common terms are defined in this list:
	
✓	Planned value (PV): The budgeted (or baseline) cost of tasks based on 
the cost of resources assigned to the task, plus any fixed costs associated 
with the tasks, at the point of measurement. In some circles, planned 
value is also known as the budgeted cost of work scheduled, or BCWS. 
For example, if you’re installing 100 fixtures, the baseline cost to install 
a fixture is $100, and you estimate that you can install 5 fixtures per day, 
the cumulative planned value for Day 3 is $1,500.
	
✓	Earned value (EV): The value of the work you’ve completed, expressed 
in dollars. For example, if you’ve installed only 13 fixtures at the end 
of Day 3, the earned value is $1,300. In some circles, earned value is 
referred to as the budgeted cost of work performed, or BCWP.
	
✓	Actual cost (AC): A calculation that includes tracked resource hours 
or units expended on the task plus fixed costs. In the example, assume 
that you had to pay overtime to complete some of the work and that the 
actual costs at the end of Day 3 are $1,650. AC is also known as actual 
cost of work performed, or ACWP.

244
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
✓	Budget at completion (BAC): The sum of the planned value. In the 
example, the BAC of the project is 100 fixtures × $100, or $10,000.
	
✓	Estimate at completion (EAC): A forecast of the total cost of the project. 
Project calculates that EAC = BAC–EV+AC. EVM practitioners cringe at 
the assumption that future costs will stay on budget. However, Project 
isn’t an EVM tool. If you need to get serious about using EVM, you can buy 
a plug-in that accurately calculates multiple EACs based on assumptions 
of future performance.
	
✓	Variance at completion (VAC): The difference between the budget at 
completion (BAC) and the estimate at completion (EAC) — VAC = 
BAC – EAC.
	
✓	Cost variance (CV): The difference between earned value and actual costs. 
The equation is CV = EV – AC. This number is expressed as a negative 
number if the project is over budget and as a positive number if you’re 
under budget.
	
✓	Schedule variance (SV): The difference between earned value and 
planned value. The equation is SV = EV – PV. This number is expressed 
as a negative number if you’re accomplishing less work than planned; 
it’s a positive number if you’re accomplishing more work than planned. 
Be aware of saying aloud that you’re behind or ahead of schedule. If the 
work isn’t on the critical path, the schedule performance doesn’t neces­
sarily indicate an ahead-of-schedule status or a behind-schedule status.
To see the Earned Value table, as shown in Figure 16-8, select the View tab on 
the Ribbon, click Tables in the Data group, select More Tables, and choose 
Earned Value.

Earned 
value table.

 Chapter 16: Project Views: Observing Progress
Calculating Behind the Scenes
While you’re happily entering resource hours and fixed costs into the proj­
ect, Project is busy making calculations that can shift around task timing and 
resource workload in the plan. These calculations relate to how tasks are 
updated, how the critical path is determined, and how earned value is calcu­
lated. If you’re a control freak, you’ll be happy to know that you can, to some 
extent, control how Project goes about making these calculations.
	
To change when Project calculates plan updates, select the File tab on the 
Ribbon, click the Options button to open the Project Options dialog box, and 
then examine the Schedule category. If you turn off the Calculate Project After 
Each Edit setting, you must click the Calculate Project button in the Schedule 
group on the Project tab of the Ribbon whenever you want Project to perform 
all its calculations. You can also choose to set different modes for only the 
current project or for all open projects.
	
In Project 2013, you can also take advantage of the Multiple Undo feature to leave 
calculations on automatic, make changes, and then undo them, thereby undoing 
the calculations in sequence. For more on Multiple Undo, see Chapter 11.
Earned-value options
As I mention earlier in this chapter, usually only large projects use earned 
value management. To find the settings to customize how earned value 
works in the project, select the File tab, click the Options button, and select 
Advanced. Scroll down until you see Earned Value options for this project. 
Figure 16-9 shows you the two sample settings for calculating earned value.
	
Figure 16-9: 
Two set-
tings to 
calculate 
earned 
value.
	

246
Part IV: Staying on Track 
The Default Task Earned Value Method setting provides these two choices:
	
✓	% Complete: This setting calculates earned value using the percent 
complete that you record on each task. The setting assumes that, on a 
task that’s halfway complete, half the work hours have been used.
	
✓	Physical % Complete: Use this setting if you want to manually enter 
a percentage of completion not based on a straight percent-complete 
calculation. For example, if you have a four-week task to complete a 
mail survey, 50 percent of the effort may happen in the first 25 percent 
of the duration of the project: Design, print, and mail the survey. Nothing 
happens for two weeks while you wait for responses and then you see a 
flurry of activity when the responses are returned to you. So a straight 
calculation that 50 percent of the task is completed 50 percent of the way 
through isn’t accurate. If your projects have a lot of tasks of this type, you 
may consider changing the settings to use this method. Then you can 
display the Physical % Complete column in the Gantt Chart sheet and 
enter more accurate (in your opinion) percent-complete information for 
each task.
The second setting in the earned-value options in the Project section of 
the Project Options dialog box is the Baseline for Earned Value Calculation 
drop-down list. The baseline you use to calculate earned value is essentially 
setting the planned value for the project. If you’re using multiple baselines — 
such as one for reporting and one for managing — pay close attention to the 
baseline against which you choose to measure the earned value. Choose any 
of the 11 possible baselines you may have saved in the project. After you 
make these two choices, click OK to close the Project Options dialog box.
An abundance of critical paths
Three settings in the Project Options dialog box concern critical path calcu­
lations. The option labeled Inserted Projects Are Calculated Like Summary 
Tasks, near the bottom of the Schedule category, is straightforward. If you 
insert another project as a task in the project, selecting this setting allows 
Project to calculate one critical path for the entire project. If you don’t select 
it, any projects that you insert are treated as outsiders — that is, they aren’t 
considered in the master project’s critical-path calculations. If an inserted 
project won’t affect the project’s timing, you may deselect this option.
If following one project’s critical path is too tame for you, start getting critical 
with multiple paths. By selecting the Calculate Multiple Critical Paths check 
box, near the bottom of the Advanced category, you set up Project to calculate 
a different critical path for each set of tasks in the project. Doing so can be 

247
 Chapter 16: Project Views: Observing Progress
helpful if you want to identify tasks that, if delayed, will cause you to miss the 
final project deadline or the goals of a single phase in the project.
Finally, you can establish which factors add a task to the critical path, by 
specifying the number of days of slack the critical tasks may have. Tasks with 
no slack are, by default, on the critical path. However, you can change this 
situation if you want to be alerted that tasks with only one day of slack are 
critical — figuring that one day isn’t much padding and that these tasks are 
still in jeopardy. The setting labeled Tasks Are Critical If Slack Is Less Than or 
Equal to (x) Days is immediately beneath the Calculate Multiple Critical Paths 
check box in the Advanced category.

L

et’s face it: A project rarely proceeds as planned. Every project has 
issues (situations that must be handled before the project can move 
forward) and risks (uncertain events that can prevent a project objective 
from being met). Issues and risks either crop up suddenly or barrel down on 
you like a freight train coming down the track. Regardless of whether you see 
risks approaching, at some point you may feel that the floor has dropped out 
from under you. One day the project is doing just fine, and the next day it’s 
$75,000 over budget. Or it appears that you’ll miss the drop-dead finish date 
by two weeks. All the aspirin in the world won’t solve this one.
The first step is to find the cause and then fix it so that you can move forward 
and try to save the project. To try to save the day when the project rolls off 
the track, analyze the options and make tough choices. (You likely already did 
this before you ever even heard of Microsoft Project.) However, Project can 
help you try some possible solutions and anticipate the likely results. After you 
decide what to do, you have to update Project to reflect the solutions.
Using Project with Risk and Issue Logs
You can proactively document problems on the project in a number of ways, 
especially if you create and maintain an issue log and a risk register on the 
project. In Chapter 12, I describe how to handle risk, assign contingency 
reserve, and update the project schedule to include the work, resources, 
time, and funding necessary to implement risk responses.

250
Part IV: Staying on Track 
An issue is a situation that you have to deal with before you can move forward, 
such as a risk that develops, a decision that has to be made, or an uncoopera­
tive stakeholder. Whatever the case, you should record issues in an issue log 
so that you can assign accountability for managing and resolving them in a 
timely manner.
You can also use Project to run what-if scenarios and develop alternative 
approaches for responding to issues or risks. You may have developed mul­
tiple baselines (described in Chapter 14) to account for various outcomes. It 
is a good practice to record task notes for those tasks affected by a risk or 
an issue. (Information on task notes is in Chapter 3.) Storing interim plans, 
multiple baselines, and task notes in Project helps you more easily explain 
messy situations to the powers that be.
Printing interim plans and baselines
Interim plans and multiple baselines demonstrate how you’ve made adjust­
ments for risks or issues. Using these two items indicates that you were 
attuned to potential problems. You should also update the boss and other 
stakeholders by generating printouts or reports reflecting potential major 
issues and risks.
	
A baseline saves pertinent project data, including start and finish dates, dura­
tion, work, and cost; an interim plan saves only the start and finish dates of tasks 
in the project. Chapter 14 describes interim plans and baselines in depth.
To view multiple baselines, follow these steps:

5.	Click the OK button to display the columns.
Printing task notes
In addition to printing interim plans and baselines, you can print task notes. 
They should include information about risk and issues such as vendor prob­
lems or late deliveries.
	
To add a note to a task, either display the Notes column in a task sheet 
pane or double-click a task and add the note on the Notes tab of the Task 
Information dialog box.
Project doesn’t let you print a single note or only the notes; you have to print 
the entire project and include the notes. To print task notes, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the File tab.
	
2.	Click Print.

252
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
3.	Go to Page Setup.
	
	A dialog box appears.
	
4.	Select the View tab.
	
5.	Check the Print Notes check box.
	
	Figure 17-2 shows the Page Setup dialog box with the Print Notes check 
box selected on the View tab.
	
6.	Click Print.
	
Figure 17-2: 
Printing 
notes.
	
When a note is associated with a task, a Note icon appears in the leftmost 
column of the schedule. You can hover the mouse on the icon to show the 
note content. If the information in the note is explained in greater detail 
in another project document — such as a risk register, an issue log, or a 
specification document — you can use the note to indicate where to find the 
detailed information. The note then serves as an indicator of additional rel­
evant information about that task.
What-If Scenarios
Just as you can be too close to a problem to see its solution, you can be too 
close to the project to recognize what you need to do. Using the filtering and 
sorting features in Project, though, you can slice and dice various aspects of 
the project somewhat differently to see a fresh perspective.

253
 Chapter 17: You’re Behind — Now What?
You can also use tools, such as resource leveling, to solve resource conflicts. 
Resource leveling may not always solve problems to your satisfaction, but 
it’s a good way to let Project show you a what-if scenario that may solve 
resource problems instantly.
	
See Chapter 12 for more information about how to use resource leveling.
Sorting tasks
Sometimes when the project isn’t going as planned, it’s time to sort tasks. 
In Project, you can sort tasks by several criteria, including start date, finish 
date, priority, and cost.
To determine how sorting can help you, consider these examples:
	
✓	To cut costs: When you sort tasks by cost, you can focus on the most 
expensive tasks first, to see whether you have room to trim useful-but-
pricey items.
	
✓	To review task timing: When you sort by duration in descending order, 
you can see the longest tasks first.
To apply a preset sorting order, simply choose View➪Sort and then choose 
an option from the submenu, such as By Start Date or By Cost.
If you want to see additional sort criteria or to sort by more than one criterion, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose View➪Sort➪Sort By.
	
	 The Sort dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-3. You can use it to 
sort by as many as three criteria in ascending or descending order.
	
Figure 17-3: 
Choosing 
criteria for 
sorting.
	

254
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
2.	In the Sort By list, select a criterion.
	
3.	Select either Ascending (to sort from lowest to highest) or Descending 
(to sort from highest to lowest).
	
	 In a date field, the sorting order is from soonest to latest and from latest 
to soonest, respectively; in a text field, alphabetical is the order.
	
4.	(Optional) If you want a second criterion, select the first Then By 
check box and make a selection.
	
	 For example, if you choose to sort first by cost and then by type, tasks 
are sorted from least expensive to most expensive and then (within each 
cost level) by type (Fixed Duration, Fixed Units, and Fixed Work).
	
5.	(Optional) If you want to add a third criterion, select the second Then 
By check box and make a selection.
	
6.	Click the Sort button.
To return to the original task order, choose View➪Sort➪By ID. Tasks are now 
back in task ID number order, which is the standard sorting criterion in Project.
Filtering
After you create and apply filters in Project, as described in Chapter 11, it’s 
a good time to call on your knowledge of these features to focus on the areas 
of the project that are at risk. Especially in larger projects, where it can be 
difficult to scan hundreds of tasks and notice which ones are running late or 
over budget, filters can home in on exactly where the trouble lies. Filters are 
on the View tab, in the Data group.
	
You can choose to remove from the display any tasks that don’t meet filter 
criteria, or you can simply highlight tasks that meet the criteria onscreen.
Table 17-1 lists filters that are useful when you’re trying to identify and solve 
problems with the schedule.
	
You may not see all these choices in the More Filters dialog box; when you 
choose View➪Filtered For➪More Filters to open it, you have to enable the 
Task option to see task-related filters and enable the Resource option to see 
resource-related filters.

You can export Project information to a program such as Excel so that you 
can use analysis tools, such as pivot tables. If this idea excites you, check out 
Excel 2013 For Dummies, by Greg Harvey. The Save As Type drop-down list at 
the bottom of the Project Save As dialog box enables you to choose the export 
format.
Examining the critical path
One useful filter in Project is named Critical; it displays or highlights all tasks 
that are on the critical path. If you’re running late, knowing which tasks can’t 
slip helps you identify areas that have no room for delay — and, conversely, 
areas where you can delay noncritical tasks and still meet the deadline. 
You may use the Critical filter to help determine how to free overallocated 
resources or get a task that’s running late back on track.

256
Part IV: Staying on Track	
Ensure that the Gantt chart shows the Gantt bars for critical tasks in red. To 
do so, make sure you’re in the Gantt chart view; then select the Gantt Chart 
Tools Format tab on the Ribbon and ensure that the Critical Tasks option is 
selected in the Bar Styles group.
You can look at the critical path in any Gantt Chart or Network Diagram view. 
Figure 17-4 shows Gantt Chart view of a project with the critical path high­
lighted using a highlight filter. Figure 17-5 shows Network Diagram view with 
the same filter applied.	
If you need a closer look at task timing, modify the timescale display to use 
smaller increments, such as days or hours. To do so, right-click the timescale 
itself and then choose Timescale, or choose Gantt Chart Tools➪View, click the 
Timescale drop-down arrow, and then select Zoom In.
Using resource leveling (again)
If you use manual resource leveling early in the project to solve resource con­
flicts prior to baselining, try it again to help you when you need to update the 
schedule. With changes to tasks and tracked activity, resource leveling may 
uncover new options to solve conflicts.

If resource leveling is set to Automatic, Project automatically performs this 
calculation every time you modify the schedule. To see whether the option 
is set to Automatic or Manual, choose Resource➪Leveling Options to open 
the Resource Leveling dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-6. If the Manual radio 
button is selected, close the dialog box and click Level All in the Leveling 
group to run resource leveling.

Part IV: Staying on Track 
Determining which factors are 
driving the timing of a task
You can use the Task Inspector feature to determine what’s causing tasks 
to occur in a certain time frame, such as dependencies, task calendars, or 
task constraints. You simply select a task and then, on the Task tab, click the 
Task Inspector button in the Tasks group. A pane then lists all factors that 
affect the timing of that task. Figure 17-7 shows an example of the Collect 
Confirmation Requirements task.
By using this feature (read more about it in Chapter 11), you can determine 
whether a task that you want to take place earlier can do so if you remove a 
dependency or constraint that’s affecting it. For example, early in the plan­
ning phase, you may have believed that collecting payment requirements 
could start only after the user interface is complete, but now you realize that 
it can start while the user interface is being developed. By understanding 
what’s driving the timing of the task, you can better search for a solution if 
that timing is causing problems.

Inspector.

 Chapter 17: You’re Behind — Now What?
How Adding People or Time 
Affects the Project
Human nature in a corporate environment often causes people to want to throw 
money and people at projects. In certain cases, that instinct is on target; 
however, you aren’t always able to draw on an endless supply of resources 
or time. For this reason, you may have to experiment with a combination of 
options that involve time and resources.
Hurrying up and making modifications
Saving time in Project requires that a task be completed earlier than scheduled 
or that the timing of the task be adjusted to use up slack. You’re likely to find 
that making this adjustment is similar to trying to solve an intricate puzzle: 
Correct one piece, and another one begins causing aggravation.
To accomplish work faster, you have these two options:
	
✓	Find more resources to help with tasks that are auto-scheduled. 
Adding people requires money, so even the schedule gets back on track, 
it will cost you.
	
✓	Modify the scope of tasks. This strategy may have an effect on the task 
quality. If you make two inspections rather than three or you shorten the 
QA cycle by a week, you may run the risk of causing problems down 
the road.
Changing the timing of tasks and shifting dependencies uses up slack to make 
up for delays, but it may leave you with no wiggle room. The next time a 
problem crops up, you’ll be up against the wall with no slack.
In reality, combining small modifications for both time and money can often 
help save the day.
Throwing people at the problem
When auto-scheduled tasks are effort-driven, tasks are accomplished when 
the specified amount of effort is expended. A task with a duration of three 
days and based on the Standard calendar, for example, requires three days × 
eight hours per day to complete (a total of 24 hours of effort). One resource 
performing this task and working full time takes three days to complete it; 

260
Part IV: Staying on Track 
three resources working full time take one day to complete the 24 hours of 
work. When you add resources to a task in this way, Project automatically 
recalculates its duration.
	
If you want Project to reduce the duration of a task when you assign more 
work resources to it, the task must be auto-scheduled, and effort-driven 
scheduling must be turned on.
Changing how resources are assigned
Beyond simply adding resources to a task, you can modify existing assign­
ments. On any given project, you may have dozens (or even hundreds) of 
resources working on tasks. All these people are working according to their 
working calendars, the percentage of resource time assigned to particular 
tasks, and their ability to do the job. Take a look at how folks were assigned 
to begin with to see whether you can save time or money by modifying those 
assignments.
You can modify assignments in several ways:
	
✓	If someone is working at, say, only 50 percent capacity on a task, con­
sider increasing the person’s assignment units.
	
✓	If a resource is available who can perform a given task more quickly, 
switch resources on the task and shorten its duration. Remember that 
the new Team Planner view can be helpful when making this type of 
switch.
	
✓	Have certain resources work overtime or let them be overbooked at var­
ious points during the project. You may have modified an overbooked 
resource’s assignments earlier to eliminate a conflict, but now you find 
that you have no choice other than to have the resource work an occa­
sional 10- or 12-hour day.
Calculating the consequences of schedule modifications
Before you get carried away from making changes to resources, stop and 
think: Adding resources to effort-driven, auto-scheduled tasks can shrink 
the task and help the project get back on track. However, depending on the 
resources’ hourly rates, this approach may cost more.
Assigning three people to work on a task doesn’t necessarily shrink the dura­
tion of the task geometrically. That’s because those people have to coordi­
nate their efforts, hold meetings, and spend more time communicating than 
they would if they were working on the task alone. If you add resources, 
Project shrinks the task geometrically: Consider adding a little time to the 
task to accommodate the inefficiencies of multiple resources.

261
 Chapter 17: You’re Behind — Now What?
Another concern about adding resources to tasks is that it may cause more 
resource conflicts, with people who are already busy being overbooked 
on too many tasks that happen in the same time frame. If you have the 
resources, and they have the skills and the time, though, beefing up the work­
force is definitely one way to perform certain tasks more quickly.
	
To add resources to a task, you can use the Resources tab in the Task 
Information dialog box, or choose the task and click the Assign Resources 
button in the Assignments group on the Resource tab of the Ribbon.
Shifting dependencies and task timing
Time is a project manager’s greatest enemy. There’s never enough time, and 
the time you have is eaten up quickly
Follow these suggestions to modify task timing and save time:
	
✓	Delete a task. You heard me. If a task represents a step that can be 
skipped and no actual work for it is tracked, simply delete the task. It 
doesn’t happen often, but sometimes — after you rethink the project — 
you realize that a few actions are unnecessary or have already been 
handled by someone else. You also can mark the task as inactive.
	
✓	Adjust dependencies. Perhaps the revision of the manual can start a few 
days before all the feedback is returned. Or perhaps the electrical and 
plumbing chores can take place at the same time rather than one after 
the other (assuming that the electrician and the plumber can stay out 
of each other’s way). Use the Predecessors tab in the Task Information 
dialog box, shown in Figure 17-8, to modify dependencies. In the Lag 
column, you can enter a negative number to allow tasks to overlap.
	
Figure 17-8: 
Modifying 
task depen-
dencies and 
applying 
lag.
	

262
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
✓	Modify constraints. Perhaps you’ve set a task to start no earlier than the 
first of the year because you don’t want to spend money on it until the 
new fiscal year budget kicks in. To save time, consider whether you can 
allow it to start a week before the end of the year and bill the costs in 
January. Examine any constraint of this type — especially those created 
to verify the timing logic.
	
✓	Verify external dependencies. If you’ve created an external link to a 
task in another project and set dependencies with tasks in the project, 
see whether the other project manager can speed up certain tasks. Or 
if the timing relationship isn’t absolutely critical, delete the link to the 
other project. It may be slowing you down more than you realize.
	
✓	Change the scheduling method or move the task. Remember that 
Project usually cannot automatically reschedule a task based on depen­
dency changes if the task is manually scheduled. You can either change 
the task to be auto-scheduled by using the Auto Schedule button in the 
Tasks group on the Task tab of the Ribbon, or you can select a manually 
scheduled task and then click the Respect Links button in the Schedule 
group on the Task tab to move it to its proper time frame. Or you can use 
the Move drop-down list on the Task tab to reschedule a task to a particu­
lar earlier or future time slot, or to one when resources are available.
	
If you’ve set resource leveling to Automatic, Project may have delayed certain 
tasks until overbooked resources are freed up. On the Resource tab, click the 
Leveling Options button in the Level group and change the setting to Manual.
When All Else Fails
Okay. You’ve monkeyed with resource assignments and shifted around task 
dependencies to save time, and you’ve deleted tasks and assigned less expen­
sive resources to save money. Still, it’s not enough. In this scenario, you have 
to say to the boss, “You can have it on time, you can have it on budget, or 
you can have quality work. Choose two.”
	
If the boss throws money at you, add resources to tasks, as discussed in the 
earlier section “Throwing people at the problem.” But keep in mind that not all 
tasks are effort driven. Some tasks aren’t shortened by adding resources.
Taking the time you need
If the boss is willing to give you more time, grab it. However, when you do, 
you have to update the project a few ways:

263
 Chapter 17: You’re Behind — Now What?
	
✓	Modify task durations. Add time to tasks that are running late. In Project, 
you do this by increasing their durations or moving out their start dates.
	
✓	Review task constraints. If you’ve specified that certain tasks can finish 
no later than a certain date, but now you’re extending the project finish 
date three months, you may be able to remove or adjust those original 
constraints accordingly.
	
✓	Add to the contingency reserve. If you have a contingency reserve task, 
you can simply add to its duration, giving more waffle room to all other 
tasks. (See Chapter 12 for more about contingency reserve.)
After you insert the extra time, you should make sure that the new timing 
of tasks doesn’t cause new resource conflicts by looking at Resource Graph 
view and then reset the baseline to reflect the new schedule. To reset a 
baseline, select the Project tab and then Set Baseline➪Set Baseline. Choose 
Baseline 1–10 in the Save Baseline dialog box to save to a different baseline 
and preserve the original.
	
Inform team members of the new timing and provide them an updated version 
of the plan.
Finding ways to cut corners
If your manager tells you to cut some corners that sacrifice quality, you have 
license to modify the quality of the deliverables. You can eliminate tasks that 
may ensure higher quality, such as a final proofreading of the employee manual. 
You can hire less-experienced and less-expensive workers, for example, and 
you can use cheaper paper or computer equipment.
To cut corners in Project, you have to
	
✓	Take fewer steps: Delete tasks. Click the ID of the task in Gantt Chart 
view, and click Delete. You also can mark the task as Inactive. (Review 
any dependencies that were broken because you deleted tasks!)
	
✓	Use less-expensive resources: Delete one set of resource assignments, 
and assign other resources to tasks in the Assign Resources dialog box.
	
✓	Use less-expensive materials: Change the unit price of material resources 
you’ve created in Resource Sheet view. Or shop around for better pricing 
on items that are set up as cost resources, and enter the lower prices 
of tasks to which you’ve assigned those resources by using the Cost 
column in the Assign Resources dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-9.

264
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 17-9: 
Modifying 
the 
resource 
cost.
	
You can also take a more sweeping approach: Simply redefine the goal of 
the project. If the goal were to launch a new product line, perhaps you can 
modify the goal to simply manage the design of the new product and then 
leave the launch to a later date or another project manager. If you were sup­
posed to produce 10,000 widgets, see whether the company can make do 
with 7,500. To make this type of change, you may have to slice and dice entire 
phases of the project — or even start from scratch and build a new plan.
	
Save the revised project schedule with a new name to provide a head- tart on 
the revised project schedule. Clear the baseline (from the project tab, choose 
Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline), make modifications, and then save a 
new baseline.
	
When you take certain steps, such as deleting tasks or modifying dependency 
relationships, the action may just cause Project to alert you to a potential 
problem you hadn’t thought of. If that happens, Project opens the Planning 
Wizard dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 17-10. If you make 
changes on your own rather than use the Planning Wizard, you may be more 
likely to create a problem.
	
Figure 17-10: 
The 
Planning 
Wizard.
	
The Planning Wizard offers you options — typically, to cancel, to proceed, or 
to proceed with modification. Read the options carefully, and consider the 
pros and cons of your choice.

H

ere it is — the big payoff. It’s your reward for entering all those task 
names and resource hourly rates, and for tracking activity on dozens 
of tasks during those late-hour sessions in the first hectic weeks of the project. 
You’re finally ready to print a report or another type of project data, receiving 
tangible benefits from Project that you can hand out at meetings and show 
off to impress the boss.
Reports help you communicate information about projects by conveying 
schedule progress, resource assignments, cost accumulation, and activities 
that are in progress or scheduled soon. You can take advantage of built-in 
reports or create new reports to include the data that’s most relevant to you. 
Dashboard Reports, Report Tools, and Visual Reports in Project 2013 offer 
graphical possibilities to help paint a picture of the progress.
Knowing that you want to impress people, Project also makes it possible to 
apply certain themes, images, shapes, charts, and tables to reports to help 
make the point.
A report isn’t the only tool you use to communicate with. You can customize 
headers, footers, and legends, and insert graphics into the schedule to make 
a presentation memorable. Other capabilities, such as customizing and copy­
ing Timeline view, enable you to incorporate Project data into reports in 
other programs.

266
Part IV: Staying on Track 
Generating Standard Reports
Standard reports are already designed for you, offering numerous choices 
regarding the information you can include. You do little more than click a few 
buttons to generate them. Essentially, you select a report category, choose a 
specific report, and print it. If the plain-vanilla version of a report isn’t quite 
right, you can modify standard reports in a variety of ways.
	
You can also print any view in Project: Simply display the view and click the 
Print button. The entire project is printed in whichever view is onscreen at the 
time. Or you can choose File➪Print. In the Print dialog box that appears, you 
can choose to print only certain pages of the project or only a specific date 
range from the timescale. Any filter or grouping that you’ve applied is shown 
in the printed document.
What’s available
On the Report tab, Project has four standard report categories: Dashboards, 
Resources, Costs, and In Progress. Each category contains several predesigned 
reports (as you can see on the Reporting Ribbon, shown in Figure 18-1), for a 
total 16 standard reports.
	
Figure 18-1: 
The Report 
Ribbon.
	
Standard reports vary in content, format (for example, a table, chart, or a 
comparison report), and sometimes page orientation (landscape or portrait). 
You can edit a report to change its name, the period it covers, the table 
of information it’s based on, and the filters applied to it. You can also sort 
information as you generate the report and add formatting, such as themes, 
images, and shapes.
Overviewing the dashboard reports
One cool new feature in Project 2013 is dashboard reporting. The program 
has five standard dashboard reports: Burndown, Cost Overview, Project 
Overview, Upcoming Tasks, and Work Overview.

267
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
To see a dashboard report, simply click the Report tab, click the Dashboards 
down arrow, and select the report you want. Figure 18-2 shows an example of 
a Cost Overview dashboard report.
	
Figure 18-2: 
Cost 
Overview 
report.
	
One new dashboard report is a burndown chart. You use it to compare the 
amount of work remaining to the baseline work remaining and the number 
of tasks remaining compared with the baseline remaining tasks. On the burn­
down chart, you can see the rate of work compared with the planned rate of 
work to determine whether you’re accomplishing work at the same rate as 
planned. If the number of tasks remaining is higher than the baseline rate, 
you’re in jeopardy of delivering late. Figure 18-3 shows a burndown chart.

Creating New Reports
Suppose that the standard report set doesn’t have exactly what you want. No 
problem! The reporting function in Project 2013 makes it a snap to create a 
new report. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Report tab, select New Report.
	
	Select the type of report you want: Blank, Chart, Table, or Comparison.
	
2.	When the Report Name dialog box opens, enter a name for the report 
and click OK.
	
	 A split window opens: The left side holds the report, and the right side 
holds a Field List.
	
3.	In the Select Category section, choose among Time, ID, Name, 
Resource Names, and Unique ID.
	
4.	From the Select Fields scroll menu, select the fields you want from the 
various categories (cost, duration, number, or work).
	
5.	Select the check box to indicate the fields you want in your report.
	
6.	If you want to apply a filter, such as incomplete tasks or active tasks, 
select one from the Filter drop-down menu.
	
7.	If you want to group information, select the appropriate grouping 
from the Group By drop-down menu.
	
8.	Select at which level you want to see information reported, such as 
Level 1 (the entire project), Level 2, or Level 3.
	
9.	Choose how to sort the data.
	
	 It’s the order in which you want to present it based on the fields you 
selected in Step 5.
	
10.	Click Enter to view the report.
After you create a new report, the report is saved on the Custom Report tab.
Gaining a new perspective on 
data with visual reports
Project offers six categories of visual reports and some custom reports that 
you can build yourself. Some visual reports are based on time-phased data 

269
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
(data distributed over time, such as allocations of resource time or costs), 
and some aren’t. Report categories are described in this list:
	
✓	Task Usage: Based on time-phased data for tasks, this report category 
lets you peek at information such as cash flow and earned value over 
time.
	
✓	Resource Usage: Based on time-phased resource data, this type of 
report includes cash flow, resource availability, resource costs, and 
resource work data.
	
✓	Assignment Usage: Also based on time-phased data, this category pro­
vides information in areas such as baseline versus actual costs and 
baseline versus actual work.
	
✓	Task Summary, Resource Summary, and Assignment Summary: These 
three report categories provide diagram views of a variety of work and 
cost data. None of these three categories is based on time-phased data.
Use the Visual Reports feature to select the fields you want to view and to 
modify the reports on the fly.
Additionally, if you enjoy the capabilities offered by pivot table reports in 
Excel and Visio, you’ll be glad to know that the same capability is available in 
Project. Using pivot tables, you can view data from a variety of perspectives 
beyond the standard Project report capabilities. Pivot tables offer perspec­
tives that are especially useful for data analysis.
Creating a visual report
Generating a visual report is simplicity itself. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Report tab, choose Visual Reports Export.
	
	 The Visual Reports – Create Report dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 18-4.
	
2.	Choose either Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Visio to view the report.
	
3.	Select the type of report you want from the available tabs.
	
4.	Click to select the report you want.
	
5.	Click View.

scope of this book, I heartily recommend Excel 2010 For Dummies, by Greg 
Harvey, and Visio 2007 For Dummies, by John Paul Mueller (both published by 
John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).	
You can modify the Visual Reports templates or create your own templates 
by using the New Template and Edit Template buttons in the Visual Reports 
dialog box. When you edit a template, you add fields to it or remove fields 
from it. Creating a new template involves specifying the format (Excel or Visio), 
choosing the data you want to report on, and selecting fields to include.
Fine-Tuning a Report
After you have lots of data available to you in Project reports, it would be 
a shame not to customize the presentation to maximize its impact. Project 
2013 helps you create reports that not only show off the information, but also 
make the information look good!

271
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
As soon as you start creating a report, Project opens a new Ribbon, named 
Report Tools, and shows the Design tab. From this tab, you can work with 
themes; insert images, shapes, and charts; and work with Page Setup in 
the print function. Before getting into all the wonderful ways you can make 
reports attractive, I cover some of the easy ways you can manipulate the 
information in the reports.
Dragging, dropping, and sizing
In Project 2013, you can resize and relocate any item on a report by simply 
clicking the item and then moving it or resizing it. If you want a particular 
section of the project overview to stand out, enlarge it and shrink the other 
sections.
You can also change the way almost any report looks by simply right-clicking 
and working with the pop-up menus that appear. Figure 18-5 shows the Project 
Overview Dashboard report with the % Complete section after right-clicking. 
Notice that you can change its fill, outline, plot area, chart type, and fields.
	
Figure 18-5:

the report 
layout.
	

272
Part IV: Staying on Track 
You can format the data series in the chart by double-clicking a chart section. 
Figure 18-6 shows what happens when you double-click the % Complete chart 
on the Project Overview Dashboard. Notice how the Ribbon changes to allow 
you to change the colors, chart data, and chart type. Along the right side of 
the chart are options to format the plot area by changing the border, color, 
transparency, width, line format, and dash type.
Looking good!
If you have no creative flair, don’t worry — Project does. You can work with 
the themes that Project provides to present all the reports with flair. From 
the Report Tools Ribbon on the Design tab, click the Themes down arrow. 
You see 21 different themes that you can apply to reports. Themes include 
color, type, font, and effect. Play around with a few to find one you like.
If none of the themes works for you, look around on the color, font, and 
effects drop-down lists until you create just the look you’re hoping for.
To customize the reports even more, you can add images such as a team 
logo, shapes, and text boxes. Figure 18-7 shows a portion of a report with a 
text box and shape added.

and text 
boxes.
	
	
Experimenting with customization options can be fun, but as with any other 
business document, the goal in layout and formatting is readability.
Keep these points in mind when you’re formatting Project text:
	
✓	Font: Choose simple sans serif fonts, such as Arial. If you’re publishing 
the project on the web, consider using Verdana, which is a font created 
for readability online.
	
✓	Color: You have to consider factors such as whether the printout will 
be in color or black and white, whether the use of too many colors will 
become confusing for the reader, and whether certain colors (such as 
yellow) will be difficult to read.
	
✓	Font size: Use a font size that’s readable, without making it so big that 
the task-bar labels become too crowded.
	
✓	Effects: Avoid text effects that can make certain text difficult to read 
(such as bold, italic, or underlining). Use these effects only to call atten­
tion to a few elements of the project.
Spiffing Things Up
These days, image is everything. You and the project may be judged to a 
certain extent by how professional the printed information looks. Even if 
the project is a million dollars over budget and four months behind, making 
reports or other printouts look good can make delivering bad news easier to 
do. You can make the project presentation look good by adding graphics.
Wouldn’t the company logo look spiffy in the header of the report? Or a pic­
ture of the new product box in Gantt Chart view of the New Product Launch 
project?

274
Part IV: Staying on Track 
Graphics can add visual information or make the plan just plain look nicer. You 
can insert graphics in the project file by using one of these three methods:
	
✓	Cut and paste a graphic from another file. A graphical image that you 
cut and paste essentially can’t be edited by you in Project.
	
✓	Insert a link to an existing graphics file. Linking reduces the Project file.
	
✓	Embed a graphic. Embedding lets you edit the content of the graphic in 
Project, using the tools of an image program such as Paint.
You can’t add graphics willy-nilly, however. You can add graphics in only a 
few places: the chart pane of any Gantt Chart view; a task note; a resource 
note; or a header, footer, or legend that’s used in reports or printouts of views.
For example, you may put pictures of resources in the Resource Note field so 
that you can remember who’s who, or you may include a photo of the corpo­
rate headquarters in the header of the report.
	
Graphics swell the size of the Project file like a sponge in a pail of water. If 
you’re thinking of using a lot of graphics, don’t let them detract from the main 
information in printouts. Or try linking to them instead of inserting them into 
the file.
If you want to insert an existing graphics file into a Notes box, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the Notes tab in the Task Information or Resource Information 
dialog box.
	
2.	Click the Insert Object button.
	
	 The Insert Object dialog box, shown in Figure 18-8, or the Insert Picture 
dialog box appears.
	
Figure 18-8: 
Browse to 
locate a file 
on the net-
work or the 
hard drive.
	

275
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
	
3.	Choose the Create from File option.
	
4.	Click the Browse button to locate the file.
	
5.	To insert to the file, select the Insert button and then click the OK 
button.
	
6.	To link the file, select the Link check box next to the Browse button.
	
	 If you don’t select this option, the object is embedded in the file.
	
7.	To insert the object as an icon, select the Display As Icon check box.
	
	 When you display the object as an icon, someone viewing the project on 
a computer can click the icon to view the picture.
	
8.	Click the OK button.
	
	 The image appears in the location you selected in Step 4.
If you want to insert an existing graphics file in a header or footer, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪Print.
	
2.	Click the Page Setup link at the bottom of the page.
	
3.	Click to open the header or footer tab in the Page Setup dialog box.
	
4.	Click the Insert Picture button, as shown in Figure 18-9.
	
	 The Insert Picture dialog box appears.
	
Figure 18-9:

box.
	

276

5.	Navigate to the folder that holds the file to insert.
	
6.	Click to select the file.
	
7.	Click the Insert button.
	
	 The image appears in the header or footer.
	
8.	Click OK.
Call the Printer!
The proof of the report is in the printing, but you should see to several adjust­
ments before you click the button to print. In Project, it’s not only margins or 
page orientation that you need to set (although you have to set them, too); 
you can also add useful information to headers and footers and set legends 
to help readers understand the many bars, diamonds, and other graphical 
elements that many Project views and reports display.
Working with Page Setup
The Page Setup dialog box can be used to control printouts of any displayed 
Project view. You can open this dialog box by choosing File➪Print➪Page 
Setup. The Page Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-10, contains six tabs.
	
Figure 18-10: 
Page setup.
	

277
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
Sizing
The Page tab contains several basic page settings that determine the ori­
entation, the paper size, and the way content is scaled to fit the page. By 
making these settings, you influence how much material can fit on a page 
and how many pages comprise the document.
You have these choices on the Page tab (refer to Figure 18-10):
	
✓	Portrait or Landscape orientation: You’ve no doubt already dealt with 
this choice. Portrait orientation is set up like the Mona Lisa, with the 
short edge of the paper running across the top of the page. In landscape 
orientation, the long edge of the paper runs across the top instead.
	
✓	Scaling: You can use the Adjust To setting, which is based on a percent­
age of the original size, or the Fit To setting, which gives you some con­
trol over scaling to fit to the width of a single page or to the height of a 
single page.
	
✓	Other: This area is a catch-all for two options: Paper Size and First Page 
Number. All the standard choices for paper size are available in the 
Paper Size list, including index cards and envelopes. First Page Number 
can remain as Auto (in which case the first page is numbered 1, the 
second page is 2, and so on), or you can enter another number there 
yourself.
Staying within the margins
I won’t bore you by defining a margin. However, I’ll remind you that a margin 
serves the dual purpose of controlling how much information can fit on a 
page and creating a border of white space that frames the document (making 
it cleaner-looking and easier to read).
To set margins using the Page Setup dialog box, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Margins tab.
	
	 As you modify margin settings, the preview shows you where they’ll 
appear on the page.
	
2.	Use the arrows to set the top, bottom, left, and right margins.
	
	 Click the up arrow for a wider margin, and click the down arrow for a 
narrower margin.
	
3.	If you want a border that represents the margin, use the Borders 
Around options.
	
	 You can choose to print a border on every page, on only outer pages 
(print a border on the first and last pages only — available only when 
printing in Network Diagram view), or on none of the pages.

278
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Setting margins to less than 1⁄4 inch (.25") can cut off the printed output, 
because printers can print only so close to the edge of a page.
Inserting headers and footers
Throughout the life of a project, you print many versions of the project, 
many reports, and many types of information using various tables. Headers 
and footers are useful features to help you, and readers, keep track of all this 
information.
You can use the Header and Footer tabs of the Page Setup dialog box (see 
Figure 18-11) to set and preview header (top) and footer (bottom) contents.
	
Figure 18-11: 
The Header 
and Footer 
tabs are 
nearly 
identical.
	
This list describes the settings you can make on these tabs:
	
✓	Text location: Specify that the text you enter will appear to the left, at 
the center, or to the right of the header or footer by clicking the corre­
sponding tab and then typing the text.
	
✓	Format text: Use the tool buttons, or quickly insert such elements as the 
page number, the date, or a picture file.
	
✓	Select standard text: Insert additional text by using these lists:
	
	General: Includes such options as Total Page Count, Project Title, 
and Company Name
	
	Project Fields: Includes all fields available in Project
	
	You can use these fields to alert readers to important fields to review 
or to the nature of the printout. To add General or Project Fields items, 
select them from their respective lists and then click the Add button to 
add them to the Left, Center, or Right tab.

279
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
Working with a legend
A legend acts as a guide to the meanings of various graphical elements, as 
shown in Figure 18-12. The Legend tab bears a striking resemblance to the 
Header and Footer tabs except that the legend is generated automatically. 
All you can specify on this tab is the text that fits in the box to the left of the 
legend.
	
Figure 18-12: 
Page setup 
with legend 
information.
	
The Legend tab of the Page Setup dialog box has only two settings that differ 
from the Header and Footer tabs:
	
✓	You can print the legend on every page or on a separate legend page, or 
you can decide not to print a legend.
	
✓	You can establish the width of the text area of the legend (the area 
where you can insert elements such as the page number or the date).
	
Unlike a header or footer, where you have to enter something to make any­
thing appear, a legend prints by default. If you don’t want a legend to print, 
click the Legend tab and then set the Legend On option to None.
Deciding what to print
If you’re printing a currently displayed view, the View tab of the Page Setup 
dialog box is available to you, as shown in Figure 18-13.

280
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 18-13: 
The View 
tab.
	
You can make these settings on the View tab:
	
✓	Print All Sheet Columns: Prints every sheet column in the view, regard­
less of whether it’s visible onscreen. With this option deselected, only 
the columns that show in the view are printed.
	
✓	Print First # Columns on All Pages: Lets you control a specific number 
of columns to print.
	
✓	Print Notes: Prints every task, resource, and assignment note. These 
items are printed on a separate Notes page.
	
✓	Print Blank Pages: Lets you print blank pages. For example, use this set­
ting to print a page that represents a time in the project when no tasks 
are occurring. If you want a smaller number of pages in the printout, 
ignore this setting.
	
✓	Fit Timescale to End of Page: Scales the timescale to fit more of the 
project on the page.
	
✓	Print Row Totals for Values within Print Date Range: Adds a column 
that contains row totals. It pertains to printouts of Usage views.
	
✓	Print Column Totals: Adds a column that contains column totals. It 
pertains to printouts of Usage views.
Getting a preview
Granted, although software print previews aren’t quite as exciting as movie 
previews, they help you make everything look right before you print the project. 
When you choose a report or choose File➪Print to print a view, the preview 
automatically appears in the Backstage. The buttons in the lower-right corner 

281
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
of the preview enable you to modify the preview so that you can work with 
the settings more effectively.
You can use the buttons in the Backstage preview to
	
✓	Move around the pages of the report by using the first four arrow buttons 
and the horizontal and vertical scroll bars
	
✓	View more detail by clicking the Actual Size button and then clicking the 
report
	
✓	Focus on a single page or all pages in the report by using the One Page 
and Multiple Pages buttons
Note: Always preview the document before printing it to review the number 
of pages being printed. One click or one instance of zooming in or out can 
easily double — or cut in half — the number of pages being sent to the 
printer. You can easily waste paper if you’re not careful.
Printing, at last!
In this section, I describe how to print the document for which you’ve made 
all the eye-pleasing settings discussed in this chapter. For this task, you 
need to make the print settings to the left of the preview in the Backstage, as 
shown in Figure 18-14.
	
Figure 18-14: 
Backstage 
Print view.
	

282
Part IV: Staying on Track 
This list describes the settings you encounter in this area:
	
✓	The Copies up arrow and down arrow: Click the Copies up arrow to 
print more copies, or click the down arrow to print fewer (but not less 
than 1).
	
✓	The Printer area: This area of the dialog box indicates the printer you 
will use. You can choose a printer from the list and click the Printer 
Properties link to control printer settings such as color quality and 
paper source.
	
✓	The Settings area: You can print the entire project or select another 
option from the drop-down list so that you can print specific dates, print 
specific pages, or print custom dates and pages. The accompanying 
options change depending on the choice. You also can use the Settings 
drop-down list to specify whether to print notes, all sheet columns, or 
only the left column of pages (to print only the leftmost column on every 
page).
	
✓	The remaining settings: These choices control the orientation and 
paper size, if you didn’t make them elsewhere.
After you make all the settings and you’re ready to print, simply click the big 
Print button in the upper-left corner.
Working on the Timeline
The Timeline gives sort of a 10,000-foot overview of the project schedule. It 
shows a graphical timeline spanning from the project’s start date to its end 
date, and it highlights the period shown in the main view, such as the time­
frame shown on the Gantt chart. You can toggle the Timeline on and off as 
needed. To do so, click the View tab on the Ribbon and select the Timeline 
check box in the Split View group.
The Timeline even has its own toolbar, Timeline Tools, as shown in Figure 18-15.
	
Figure 18-15: 
The 
Timeline 
Tools 
toolbar.
	

283
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
From the Timeline Tools toolbar, you can format text and dates, format the 
display of tasks on the toolbar, and copy the Timeline in various presentation 
formats.
Adding tasks to the Timeline
You can add summary tasks, detailed tasks, and milestones to the Timeline. 
For example, the Timeline, shown in Figure 18-16, shows milestones, the Print 
summary task, and a callout for the Obtain City Permits task. Yes, you can do 
all these wonderful things!
	
Figure 18-16: 
The 
Timeline, 
with tasks, 
summary 
tasks, and 
milestones.
	
You can add information to the Timeline in a number of ways. To add several 
tasks at a time, follow these simple steps:
	
1.	Open the Timeline from the View tab.
	
2.	Click the Timeline.
	
	 This step shows the Timeline Tools toolbar above the Format tab.
	
3.	Click Timeline Tools to show the Timeline Tools toolbar (refer to 
Figure 18-15).
	
4.	Click Existing Tasks in the Insert group.
	
	 The Add Tasks to Timeline dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 18-17, 
showing an outline of all tasks in the project. You can select as many 
as you like. They appear on the Timeline as individual tasks, summary 
tasks, or milestones, depending on how they’re entered in Project.
	
5.	Click OK.

284
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 18-17: 
Adding 
tasks to the 
Timeline.
	
You can also add a new task by clicking the Task button in the Insert group to 
open the Task Information dialog box and then entering the task information, 
adding the predecessor and successor information, and assigning resources. 
When you select the Display on Timeline check box, the task appears on the 
Timeline.
If you want to change the way a task appears on the Timeline, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Click to select the task.
	
2.	In the Current Selection group, select either Display As Bar to show a 
bar that indicates the duration or Display As Callout to create a call­
out box that holds the task information.
	
3.	Reposition the callout box to improve readability, if you have several 
tasks close together.
	
You can right-click a task and click Add to Timeline to make the task show up 
on the Timeline.
Customizing the Timeline
Project lets you customize the Timeline to make it truly fit your needs. For 
example, you can freeze the Timeline or move it around so that it focuses on 
a particular timeframe. When you move the timeframe in Timeline, the Gantt 
chart moves in parallel. To move the Timeline, follow these steps:

285
 Chapter 18: Spreading the News: Reporting
	
1.	Click the Timeline so that the Timeline Tools toolbar appears.
	
2.	In the Show/Hide group, select Pan & Zoom.
	
	A green frame surrounds the current timeframe.
	
3.	Position the cursor on the edge to drag the timeframe to the size you 
like.
	
4.	To shift the timeframe to a different one, move the cursor to the top 
of the frame, wait for the four-way arrow, and drag the green frame to 
the timeframe you want.
You can also change the date format from the Show/Hide group on the 
Timeline Tools toolbar. Simply click the down arrow and select the way you 
want to see the date displayed on the Timeline.
The Timeline can be displayed with details about tasks, such as the task 
name and dates, or without the detail and just milestones and bars that rep­
resent tasks, but no names associated with the tasks. If you want a detailed 
view, select the Detailed Timeline check box in the Show/Hide group.
Copying the Timeline
Because that vendor you’re trying to coordinate with doesn’t use Project, 
you need to share the graphical Timeline information via another file format. 
Project builds in the special capability to take a snapshot of the Timeline so 
that you can paste it into an e-mail message; a presentation; or another pro­
gram, such as a word processor.
Follow these steps to copy and use the Timeline:
	
1.	From the Timeline Tools, choose Copy Timeline and then select a 
format.
	
	 The available format choices are For E-Mail, For Presentation, and Full 
Size.
	
2.	Create the e-mail message or document where you want to use the 
Timeline image.
	
3.	Position the insertion point where you want the Timeline image to 
appear.
	
4.	Press Ctrl+V.
	
	 The image appears in the message or document.

Enhanced Copy and Paste
Though it has long been possible to copy and paste information to and from 
Project and other Office applications, sometimes the results were, well, 
messy. Now, copy-and-paste operations between applications retain much 
more information. For example, when you copy tasks from Project and paste 
them into Word or Excel, you automatically see outline-level formatting and 
column headings. And formatting from information copied from another 
application into Project is retained. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel 
every time you need to copy data between apps — and that’s a sweet, sweet 
thing.

ave you ever finished a project and then wondered how in the heck it 
turned out the way it did? The budgeted totals mystically appear to 
be several thousand dollars over the original estimates; you missed the final 
deadline by three weeks; and somewhere along the line, you lost track of 
three people who were supposed to be working on tasks. But you delivered 
the deliverables (somehow), and you can finally stuff the project file in the 
bottom of a drawer. Or can you?
Don’t think of Microsoft Project as simply a giant electronic to-do list; rather, 
it’s a sophisticated tool that’s used to manage projects. And the logical 
byproduct of that management is a fantastic treasure trove of information 
you can use to become a more highly skilled Project user — and, thus, a 
more competent project manager.
After you send the last memo related to the project and accept the final 
kudos or criticism from your boss, take a moment to look over the Project 
schedule one more time.
Reviewing the Project
When I teach classes in project management, my students are often over­
whelmed by all the information they have to collect, analyze, and report. Add 
to these elements a product such as Microsoft Project, and many times students 
begin reeling from all the data that they have to input and all the information 
that Project spews at them. They can’t see straight for all the views, reports, 
tables, and filters that they have to use to access information about their 
projects.

288
Part IV: Staying on Track 
I tell them this secret: You won’t understand every aspect of managing your 
first, second, or even third project. But you will become more comfortable 
with your skills. Similarly, you won’t understand every nuance of the Project 
schedule on your first project. You won’t even uncover every capability of 
Project on your second project. But gradually, as you master the ins and outs 
of managing projects and using Project, you’ll more effectively apply proj­
ect management skills and more easily absorb the information that Project 
­generates — and you’ll more quickly understand how it can help you avoid 
mistakes on future projects.
Review every project at the end of each phase and at the end of the project 
to see what you did right and what you did wrong. Then you can use what 
you discover to improve your skills on the next project.
Learning from your mistakes
You know what they say: If you don’t study history, you’re doomed to repeat 
it. And repeating a mistake is the last thing you want to do when managing a 
project.
Consider these strategies when reviewing your last project:
	
✓	Compare the original baseline plan against the final actual activity, 
as shown in Figure 19-1. Even if you created interim or baseline plans 
to adjust for drastic changes, look at the widest gap between what you 
expected to happen in the initial plan and what did happen. This strategy 
can be the best way to see areas where you tend to underestimate the 
most or where changes in the project’s scope caused dramatic changes.
	
Figure 19-1: 
Baseline 
and actual 
figures.
	

289
 Chapter 19: Getting Better All the Time
	
✓	Review the notes you made about tasks to remind yourself of changes 
or problems that cropped up. Insert the column named Notes into the 
Gantt Chart sheet and read all notes in one sitting.
	
✓	Note which resources failed to deliver as promised; if you manage 
them, provide them constructive feedback. If you don’t manage 
resources, maintain notes on their working speed and quality to assist in 
future assignments. Also note which outside vendors failed to perform 
as expected (and move them to the bottom of the hiring list).
	
✓	Assess your own communications in saved e-mails or memos. 
Determine whether you gave the team enough information to perform 
effectively and whether you informed management about project issues 
in a timely way.
	
✓	Assess feedback from your boss, your customers, and other stakehold­
ers. Determine whether any overall constraints, such as the project 
budget or deliverables, changed dramatically during the course of the 
project. Ask whether end users were satisfied with the rate at which you 
completed the project and delivered the final product. Inquire about 
the team’s performance from their perspective and about whether they 
would rely on you to lead another, similar project.
Debriefing the team
No project is the province of a single person. Even if no one else ever 
touched the Project plan, your team still provided input for that plan via the 
hours of activity they reported and the information they provided to you 
during the course of the project.
Debrief yourself
To evaluate the success of a project, assess 
whether team members gave you the infor­
mation you needed to operate efficiently, or 
whether you should lay down more stringent 
ground rules for reporting in the next project. 
If you were swamped with work throughout 
the project, consider having someone update 
entries for you the next time around. Determine 
whether management apprised you of company 
changes in a timely way so that you could make 
adjustments to maintain the schedule.
In the heat of the project battle, many team 
members often have no time to stop and change 
processes or to find the help they need. Review 
the Project Notes areas to see what types of 
mix-ups occurred and when (or which ones 
made you want to pull your hair out). Then insti­
tute changes before you begin the next project.

290
Part IV: Staying on Track
Follow these suggestions for refining the communications process:	
✓	Ask team members about the success of actual activity reporting. Did 
you send e-mail, schedule notes, route files, or use the Project Web App 
tools, such as TimeSheet, to gather resource information? Did you con­
sider taking advantage of all the benefits of online collaboration? Should 
you do so on the next project?	
✓	Determine whether your team rates your communications as frequent 
and thorough. Did you share with resources too little information about 
the project, or did you inundate them with too much? Did you send 
simple reports on specific aspects of the project or send entire (cumber­
some) Project files? Did the management team feel that your reporting 
on the project was sufficient for their needs? Should you learn to take 
better advantage of other software, such as Excel and Visio, accessed

✓	Did you integrate activity on various projects successfully so that 
resources weren’t overbooked or underused? If team members 
reported conflicts with other projects, use special Project tools, such 
as deliverable-based plans or master projects, to link tasks and view 
resource conflicts.
Comparing Versions of a Project
Project managers sometimes prefer to save new versions of project plans 
rather than work with interim plans. This approach can work, but it doesn’t 
enable the project history to be captured in a single project file. No matter — 
Project’s Compare Versions feature lets you see the differences between two 
Project plan files. These files can be either two different versions of the plan 
for a single project or files for two separate projects that happen to be similar.
You can use this method to either review events from a completed project 
or compare similar new projects as you’re building them. The finished com­
parison report shows you the project differences graphically and provides a 
legend to identify report features.
To compare two files in Project, follow these steps:	
1.	 Open the file that you want to compare.		
The active file is considered the current project.

291
 Chapter 19: Getting Better All the Time
	
2.	From the Report tab, click the Compare Projects button in the Project 
group.
	
	 The Compare Project Versions dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-2.
	
Figure 19-2: 
Comparing 
project  
versions.
	
	
3.	If the file to compare doesn’t appear in the drop-down list labeled 
Compare the Current Project (filename) to This Previous Version, 
click the Browse button to search for and select the appropriate file.
	
	 The file you select is considered the previous project.
	
4.	To compare tables other than the default tables that are shown, select 
the appropriate tables from the Task Table and Resource Table drop-
down lists.
	
5.	Click the OK button.
	
6.	If you see a message indicating that you have too many columns to 
compare, click OK to continue.
	
	 Project runs the comparison and displays the comparison report, as 
shown in Figure 19-3. The comparison report appears in the upper pane, 
and the individual project files show up in the two lower panes. The 
legend at the left describes the symbols in the Indicators column of the 
report; for example, the Project Kick Off task (Task 5) has a plus-sign (+) 
indicator, so it appears in only the current project. On the Gantt chart, 
the narrow green bars represent the current project, and the blue bars 
represent the previous project.
	
7.	Click Resource Comparison in the View group on the Compare 
Projects tab.
	
	 The Comparison Report pane changes to display resource information.

8.	Click the Close (X) button on the Legend for Comparison Report pane 
to close the pane.
	
	 Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar and name the file so 
that the next time you want to view this comparison report, the projects 
and fields will already be set up.
Building on Success
Although human nature often makes people focus unnecessarily on the short­
comings resulting from a project, the fact is that you’ve likely done many 
things well. Before you start planning another project, you want to store the 
positive aspects somewhere that you can easily find later.
Creating a template
One option for saving information from your current project is to create a 
template, which is simply a file you save that contains the settings you want 
to replicate. When you open a template, you can save it as a Project document 
with a new name and all those settings already built in.

293
 Chapter 19: Getting Better All the Time
Project contains its own templates for common types of projects, but you 
can save any project as a template. If you often repeat the same set of tasks 
in a project — as people in many industries do — save yourself the time of 
re-creating all those tasks.
Templates can contain, in addition to any tasks in the project, any or all of 
these types of information for those tasks:
	
✓	All information for each baseline
	
✓	Actual values
	
✓	Rates for all resources
	
✓	Fixed costs
You can save all this information or only selected items. For example, if you 
create numerous fixed costs (such as equipment) and resources with associ­
ated rates (and you use them in most projects), you can save a template with 
only fixed costs and resource rates.
To save a file as a template, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the file you want to save and then choose File➪Save As.
	
2.	In the Save and Sync pane, select where you want to save the template.
	
	 You can save it in SharePoint, on your computer, in the cloud, or in 
another location that you add.
	
	 The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.
	
3.	Navigate to where you want to save the template.
	
4.	Click the Save button.
	
	 Microsoft saves templates in the central folder named Templates.
Mastering the Organizer
The marvelously flexible nature of Project lets you customize many settings 
such as tables, filters, views, and reports. For example, you can create sepa­
rate tables of data to display in views that contain sheet panes. You can also 
create separate filters, reports, and calendars. If you have any kind of a life, 
you may not want to spend evenings re-creating all these elements on the 
next project. Instead, use the Organizer to copy them to other Project files.

294
Part IV: Staying on Track 
	
Figure 19-4: 
Saving a 
file as a 
template.
	
You can use the Organizer to copy information from one file to another 
file. These are some of the most common types of items you can copy with 
Organizer:
	
✓	Calendar
	
✓	Field
	
✓	Filter
	
✓	Form
	
✓	Group
	
✓	Report
	
✓	Table
	
✓	Toolbar
	
✓	View
	
If you want to make a custom item that you’ve created in the current file avail­
able for use in all Project plan files, use the Organizer to copy the item into the 
global template Global.MPT. Though some items are copied to the Organizer 
by default, it never hurts to ensure that crucial items are saved there.
Follow these steps to use the Organizer:
	
1.	Open the project that you want to copy items from and the project to 
copy items to.

295
 Chapter 19: Getting Better All the Time
	
2.	In the file you want to copy to, choose File➪Info.
	
	 Backstage view opens, showing the overall file choices.
	
3.	Click the Organize Global Template button.
	
	 The Organizer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-5.
	
Figure 19-5: 
The 
Organizer 
dialog box.
	
	
4.	Click the tab for the type of information you want to copy.
	
5.	In the left column, click the line to copy from.
	
	 By default, Project selects the Global.MPT template for the list on the 
left and the file from which you open the Organizer for the list on the 
right. If you want to copy items from another open file instead, choose it 
by clicking the drop-down list below the file list on the right. (Depending 
on the tab you display, the drop-down list may be named Views 
Available In, Groups Available In, or Reports Available In, for example.)
	
6.	Click the Copy button.
	
	The item appears in the list on the right.
	
7.	(Optional) To rename a custom item that you’ve created,
	
a.	Click it and then click the Rename button.
	
b.	Enter a new name in the Rename dialog box that appears and then 
click the OK button.
	
8.	To copy additional items on the same tab, repeat Steps 5 and 6.
	
9.	To copy an item on a different tab, repeat Steps 4–8.
	
10.	When you finish copying items from one file to another, click the 
Close (X) button.
	
	 Don’t rename default items in the Organizer. Renaming them can cause 
errors and malfunctions, such as the inability to display a particular view.

Ten Golden Rules of Project 
Management
In This Chapter

▶	Scheduling projects efficiently
▶	Benefitting from mistakes
A

s you begin to use Project 2013, the common sayings (or aphorisms, 
axioms, and precepts) in this chapter can help you recall basic project-
management principles. Tack them on your office wall so that you can review 
them throughout the workday.
Roll with It
Rolling wave planning is an excellent way to simplify the management of a 
project. Plan no further into the future than you can reasonably see — and 
don’t plan in more detail than makes sense. When a project is first chartered, 
you only have milestone dates. As you begin to understand more about the 
project, you can define the project life cycle and the key deliverables to be 
created in each of its phases.
Build the project in phases. Start with the initial phases, and fill in detailed 
tasks, sequences, resources, and durations. Leave the later phases at a high 
level of detail; that way, you’ll have less work to redo on later tasks that 
simply can’t be anticipated at the beginning of the project. You’ll also have 
less need to manipulate the baseline of those later tasks: If tasks are too far 
in the future, their time requirements won’t match up with the resources you 
originally set aside for them.

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
When it’s early in the game, avoid delving into detail on tasks that are far in 
the future.
Project can help you with rolling wave planning when you use these features 
of the program:
	
✓	Linking: Lets you combine subprojects into a master project
	
✓	Network Diagram view: Helps you visualize project phases graphically
	
✓	Timeline: Shows milestones, deliverables, and phases at a high level
	
✓	Task expansion and collapse: Lets you hide or display project phases
	
See Chapter 3 for more about the best ways to collapse and expand summary 
tasks and subtasks.
Put Your Ducks in a Row
Before you start creating the project, do your homework. If you don’t have all 
the information you need when you sit down at the computer to work with 
Project, you’ll continually stop, midplan, and run off to find the information — 
not an efficient way to work.
Before you sit down to build a project schedule, think about the following 
project information:
	
✓	Reality check of basic expectations: Based on your experience in man­
aging similar projects over time, determine whether the deliverables, 
budget, and preliminary schedule are within reason. Decide whether 
to discuss changes to the scope and budget to avoid a project that’s 
unrealistic from the start.
	
✓	Resource information: If the resource is human, record the resource’s 
full name, contact information, skills, cost, schedule, timing conflicts, 
manager’s name, and manager’s contact information. For equipment or 
facilities, find its availability and cost.
	
✓	Team structure: Determine whether one team member records every­
one else’s progress or all resources do their own tracking. Decide who 
updates the schedule after changes are made, who receives copies of 
which reports, and who has access to the master schedule online.
	
✓	Management expectations: Ask whether management expects to see 
regularly scheduled basic reports or another type of report instead. Ask 
how, and from whom, to get budget approval at various phases in the 
project planning, and ask whether any cross-enterprise interests will 

301
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
require reports or approval from multiple sources. (See Chapter 18 for 
the lowdown on reports.)
	
✓	Company policies: These documents may spell out working hours and 
overtime policies, holiday calendars, charges for overhead costs or proj­
ect markups, and the sharing (or not) of information with clients and 
vendors.
After you contemplate the issues in this list, you’re ready to sit down and start 
entering information into a Project project. (Do you hear an echo in here?)
Expect the Unexpected
You know he’s out there — Murphy and his darn law stipulating that anything 
that can go wrong will go wrong. Most projects, especially lengthier and more 
complex projects, aren’t completed on time or on budget. Your job as the 
project manager is to plan as accurately as you can and then make prudent 
adjustments whenever someone throws a wrench into the works — and 
Project gives you lots of tools to do it. But beyond all the automated features 
of Project, you can anticipate change by simply planning for it.
The critical path determines the project duration. Every wise project manager 
builds contingency reserve time and funds into his or her projects. When a 
project wraps up a week late and $5,000 over budget, only the project man­
ager knows that it was four weeks later and $25,000 costlier than originally 
scheduled, with no contingency reserve. (I introduce contingency reserve in 
Chapter 12.)
	
Add contingency reserve before major deliverables or the end of a phase to 
account for unexpected events. You can even add a Contingency task and 
resource it with Murphy.
Use the cost resource type (rather than a work or material resource) to add a 
set amount of contingency reserve to a task or phase.
Don’t Put Off Until Tomorrow . . .
Though Project management software can simplify many aspects of your 
work life, most people using Project for the first time become overwhelmed 
by the amount of time they spend entering and updating data. These tasks 
can certainly be cumbersome, but the reward from mastering the automated 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
updating and reporting capabilities in Project more than makes up for any 
labor they endure up front.
	
Whenever possible, import tasks from Outlook or Excel into Project to help 
speed data entry in the planning phase.
Track as often as you can — at least once a week. If you don’t tend to the task 
of tracking progress on a project, you may wind up behind the proverbial 
eight ball. This strategy not only saves you from having to enter a mountain 
of tracking data, but also lets you — and your team — see the status of the 
project at any time. That way, you can promptly spot disaster approaching 
and make preventive adjustments.
Delegate, Delegate, Delegate
Avoid the urge to attempt to do everything on a project yourself. Although 
creating and maintaining the Project file on your own might seem to give you 
more control over the result, flying solo in a larger project is nearly impossi­
ble (and possibly a full-time job). Of course, you can’t allow dozens of people 
to make changes to the plan, because you would risk losing track of who did 
what and when. However, following these few simple practices can convert a 
few fingers in the project pie from harmful to helpful:
	
✓	Designate one person to handle all data. This person’s mission is to 
enter all tracking data into the master file.
	
✓	Break the project into a few subprojects, and assign people whom you 
trust to act as managers of those phases. Let them handle their own 
tracking and adjustments, and then assemble the phased projects into a 
master project so that you can monitor their changes.
	
✓	Set uniform procedures for the team up front. Don’t let one team 
member report time on an interoffice memo sheet, another send you his 
progress by e-mail, and others record their work hours in the time sheet 
willy-nilly. Work out a strategy that uses Project features to communicate 
consistently.
	
You can track progress at a high level, such as 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 per­
cent, and 100 percent complete. (I discuss tracking in Chapter 15.)

303
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
Document It
Most people have heard the project management warning “Cover your 
assumptions,” and Project helps you do it easily. Use these features to docu­
ment the details of the project:
	
✓	Notes area: Use it for both tasks and resources to make a record of 
background information, changes, or special issues.
	
✓	Reports: Customize them to incorporate all pertinent information and 
help document trends and changes, as detailed in Chapter 18.
	
✓	Visual Reports: Use this new feature to paint the picture of the project 
status for visually oriented stakeholders; see Chapter 18.
Save multiple versions of the project, especially if you change the baseline in 
later versions. This way, you have a record of every step in the project plan­
ning to refer to when questions arise down the road.
Keep the Team in the Loop
I’ve worked in offices where I spent more time wrestling with the question of 
whom to keep informed about what than I did working. If I didn’t include mar­
keting and finance in every e-mail on a new product launch, I’d be called on 
the carpet the next day, or (worse) a vital action step would fall through the 
cracks because someone didn’t know to take action. Follow these methods of 
keeping communication channels open:
	
✓	Use Project features that integrate with Outlook or other e-mail pro­
grams. Use them to send Project files or other types of communications.
	
✓	Update the communications management plan. Document who needs 
what information, when, and how often. I discuss this plan in Chapter 15.
	
✓	Review progress with team members by meeting regularly in person, 
over the phone, in an online chat area, or via meeting software. 
Ensure that all team members have the latest version of the Project 
schedule to refer to during these meetings.
	
✓	Display the work breakdown structure (WBS) code on reports. Then 
you can easily refer to specific tasks in large projects without confusion. 
Work breakdown structures are covered Chapter 2.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Measure Success
When you begin the project, you should have an idea of what constitutes suc­
cess, and you should know how to measure that success. You’ve heard this 
one: “You can have the deliverable on time, on budget, or done right. Choose 
two.” Success can involve attaining many goals, such as
	
✓	Customer satisfaction
	
✓	Management satisfaction
	
✓	Meeting budget constraints
	
✓	Being on time
To determine how you’ll measure success, ask these questions:
	
✓	Will success in budgeting mean not exceeding the original estimates by 
more than 10 percent? 
	
✓	Will the project be considered on time if you work on it the estimated 
number of weeks minus a two-month period when you were on hold for 
a union strike, or is the total working time less important than meeting a 
specific deadline? 
	
✓	How will you measure customer satisfaction? 
	
✓	Will management satisfaction be a done deal if you’re promoted or your 
division receives more funding?
	
✓	Does a successful product launch include high sales figures after the 
launch, or was the project successful merely because you moved it out 
the door?
	
Place milestones in the project that reflect the achievement of each type of 
success. When you reach one, you can pat your team on the back. Knowing 
what success looks like helps you motivate your team to get there.
Maintain a Flexible Strategy
Stuff happens. There’s never been a project that didn’t require accommoda­
tions for surprises along the way. The mark of a good project manager is 
that she’s alert to these changes and makes adjustments to deal with them 
quickly.

305
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
Making adjustments to accommodate bad news isn’t easy; in fact, it can be 
truly difficult to deliver bad news. However, avoiding a problem in the proj­
ect and hoping that it will simply disappear has a nasty habit of snowballing 
into an even worse problem. The following tools can help you stay alert to 
changes and make adjustments:
	
✓	The work contour option can help you change the contour of the work 
to front-load, back-load, or otherwise change the spread of work over 
the duration of the task, as described in Chapter 9.
	
✓	Use the Task Inspector, detailed in Chapter 17, to see what’s driving a 
task. You can look for options such as adding resources, revising task 
dependency relationships, and using reserve.
	
✓	Turn on critical path formatting to see the critical path of the project and 
track how much slack remains. Adjusting tasks to efficiently use up their 
slack can keep you on schedule in a crisis, as I describe in Chapter 17.
Learn from Your Mistakes
One great gift that Project offers is the capability to look back after complet­
ing a project so that you can learn from your mistakes. You can review the 
original schedule, and every version after it, to see how well you estimated 
time and money, and then figure out how to do it better.
By using records of the project, you can spot trends to find out, for example, 
where you always seem to miss on timing, or why you always allow much 
too little time for market research and much too much time for questions 
and answers. Perhaps you always forget to budget for temporary help during 
rush periods, or you overstaff early on, when you need only a few people.
Use the wealth of information in Project schedules to educate yourself on 
your own strengths and weaknesses as a project planner and manager and to 
improve your skills with each project you take on.

Ten Cool Shortcuts in Project 2013
In This Chapter
▶	 Viewing task and resource information
▶	 Keeping shortcuts close at hand
▶	 Changing the view for better focus
▶	 Finagling the format for better schedule management
I
’m always amazed to watch people work who are adept at using a specific 
type of software. Their fingers seem to fly over the keyboard; without ever 
touching the mouse, they create documents, presentations, and other arti­
facts. In this chapter, I show you ten cool shortcuts that can help you handle 
Project 2013 like a pro.
Task Information
From Gantt Chart view, you can double-click any task in the project to 
open the Task Information dialog box. You can then use it, as shown 
in Figure 21-1, to enter or modify durations, predecessor information, 
resources, notes, task types, and constraints.	
Figure 21-1: 
The Task 
Information 
dialog box.	
In Chapter 2, I give you more information about the Task Information 
dialog box.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Resource Information
If you want to know anything about a resource, you can find the information 
in the Resource Information dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-2. From any 
Resource Sheet view, double-click a resource name to see contact information, 
availability, cost rates, and any notes you’ve entered about the resource.
	
Figure 21-2: 
The 
Resource 
Information 
dialog box.
	
You can use the Resource Information dialog box to enter, edit, or update 
resource information for people, supplies, equipment, and locations consid­
ered to be resources. In Chapter 7, I detail how to work with resources in 
Project.
	
When the Assign Resources dialog box is open, double-click a resource name 
to display the Resource Information dialog box.
Frequently Used Functions
Most user actions in Project are fairly standard, so you shouldn’t have to 
visit the Ribbon every time you want to give a command. Instead, you can 
simply right-click a task to display a floating menu of options that let you (for 
example)
	
✓	Cut, copy, and paste text
	
✓	Insert and delete tasks
	
✓	Assign resources
	
✓	Navigate to the Task Information dialog box
	
✓	Add notes
	
✓	Add the task to the timeline

309
 Chapter 21: Ten Cool Shortcuts in Project 2013
Figure 21-3 shows a typical menu of options you see after right-clicking a task.
	
Figure 21-3: 
Floating 
menu bar.
	
Subtasks
Sometimes, you need to see portions of the project expanded to show all tasks 
in detail while other portions remain rolled up to a summary task level. In 
addition to the standard method of clicking the triangle next to the summary 
task to expand or summarize tasks, you can use keystrokes.
To hide a subtask, press Alt+Shift+hyphen (–). To show subtasks, press 
Alt+Shift+plus sign (+).
Indenting and Outdenting
In Chapter 2, I introduce the work breakdown structure (WBS), which lets 
you show the parent-child relationship in a task by indenting its subtasks 
to create the outline (the WBS) of the project. Instead of selecting all the 
tasks you want to work with and then indenting or outdenting them from the 
Ribbon, you can select them and then press Alt+Shift+right arrow to indent 
them. To outdent a task, press Alt+Shift+left arrow.
Fill Down
Suppose that all the tasks in a series have the same resource or the same 
duration. Rather than repeatedly enter the same resource or duration, you 
can enter the duration on the topmost task in the list, select the rest of the 
tasks, and then press Ctrl+D. Project “fills down” the resource to the rest of 
the selected tasks.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Navigation
The Alt key is a helpful tool for navigating to the beginning or end of the proj­
ect. Simply press Ctrl+Home to move to the beginning of the project or press 
Ctrl+End to move to the end.
You can also press the Alt key to navigate around the timescale. To move to 
the right (forward in time), press Alt+right arrow. To move to the left (back­
ward in time), press Alt+left arrow.
Hours to Years
Sometimes, you want to see the big-picture view of the project by viewing the 
timescale at the level of months and years. At other times, you need to see 
details about when tasks will occur. In Project, you can set the timescale to 
show time in years, all the way down to hours. To show incrementally larger 
timescale units, press Ctrl+/ (slash). To show smaller, more detailed times­
cale units, press Ctrl+Shift+* (asterisk).
Timeline Shortcuts
Even the Timeline has shortcuts. When you first show the Timeline, it dis­
plays the text Add tasks with dates to the timeline, as shown in 
Figure 21-4. Double-click the text to open the Add Tasks to Timeline dialog 
box. (Refer to the figure.) Every task is accompanied by a check box; simply 
select the ones you want to show on the Timeline.
	
Figure 21-4: 
Adding 
tasks to the 
Timeline.
	

311
 Chapter 21: Ten Cool Shortcuts in Project 2013
	
Double-clicking the initial text to open the Add Tasks to Timeline dialog box 
only works the first time you open the Timeline. After you begin entering infor­
mation on the Timeline, the text that appears on it the first time you open it 
(Add tasks with dates to the timeline) disappears, and you have to 
enter tasks by right-clicking them first and choosing Add to Timeline from the 
shortcut menu.
Quick Find
To find information quickly within the project, press Ctrl+F to open the Quick 
Find dialog box. Then type the word you want to find in the Find What box.

Appendix
Glossary

activity: Also known as task, an individual step performed to reach a project’s 
goal.
actual: Final reporting data for a task, such as the date when the task really 
started versus its planned start date or the amount of work completed versus 
the planned amount of work.
ACWP (actual cost of work performed): Cost of the actual, real work done on 
a task, work package or project to date.
ALAP (as late as possible): A constraint put on a task’s timing to make the 
task occur as late as possible in the project schedule, taking into account any 
dependency relationships. 
analogous estimate: An estimating method that takes information from past 
similar projects into consideration when developing estimates for the current 
project. 
ASAP (as soon as possible): A constraint put on a task’s timing to make the 
task occur as early as possible in the project schedule, taking into account 
any dependency relationships. This is the default constraint type. 
automatically scheduled (auto-scheduled): A task mode where Project cal­
culates the schedule as needed based on task dependencies, constraints, and 
resource availability. 
BAC (budget at completion): The sum total of all costs involved in completing 
a task, work package or project. See also baseline cost.
Backstage view: The area that presents files and options when you click the 
File tab.
baseline: The formally agreed-upon dates for starting, finishing, duration, 
work, and cost data in the project. Later, actual schedule and duration, work, 
and cost data are tracked so they can be compared with the baseline data.

314
Project 2013 For Dummies 
baseline cost: The formally agreed-upon planned costs for a project’s tasks, 
used to compare with actual costs as they are incurred.
BCWP (budgeted cost of work performed): Also called earned value; the 
value of work that has been completed on a task, work package, or project. 
For example, a task with $1,000 of costs accrues a BCWP of $750 when it’s 
75 percent complete.
BCWS (budgeted cost of work scheduled): The budget for the scheduled 
task, work package, or project.
booking type: A category for resources that specifies whether they’re com­
mitted to the project or simply proposed to be involved.
calendar: The various settings for hours in a workday, days in a workweek, 
holidays, and nonworking days on which a project schedule is based. You 
can set Project, Task, and Resource calendars.
Change Highlighting: A feature that highlights duration, start, and finish data 
changes caused by any other changes you’ve made in your project since you 
last saved it.
charter: A document that formally authorizes or recognizes a project.
circular dependency: A timing relationship among tasks that creates an 
endless loop that can’t be resolved.
collapse: To close a project outline to hide subtasks from view.
combination view: A Project view with task/resources details appearing at 
the bottom of the screen.
constraint: A parameter that forces a task to fit a specific timing. For 
example, a task can be constrained to start as late as possible in a project. 
Constraints interact with dependency links to determine a task’s timing.
contingency reserve: Time or money that’s factored into your schedule or 
budget to mitigate identified risks.
cost: The amount of money associated with a task when you assign resources, 
which are equipment, materials, or people with associated fees or hourly 
rates, and any additional fixed costs.
cost variance (CV): The difference between the baseline costs and the com­
bination of actual costs to date and estimated costs remaining (scheduled 
costs). The cost variance is either positive (over budget) or negative (under 
budget). When using earned value management, CV is the difference between 
the earned value and the actual cost, shown as EV–AC = CV.

 Appendix: Glossary
critical path: The series of tasks that must occur on time for the overall 
project to meet its deadline. The end date of the critical path is the earliest 
a project can be completed. Any slip on the critical path causes a slip in the 
due date.
critical task: A task on the critical path. See also critical path.
crosstab: A report format that compares two intersecting sets of data. For 
example, you can generate a crosstab report that shows the costs of critical 
tasks that are running late.
cumulative cost: The planned total cost to date on a particular task. This 
calculation adds the costs already incurred on a task to any planned costs 
remaining for the uncompleted portion of the task.
cumulative work: The planned total work on a particular task. This calculation 
adds the work completed on a task to any planned work remaining for the 
uncompleted portion of the task.
current date line: The vertical line in a Gantt chart that indicates today’s 
date and time. See also Gantt Chart view.
deadline date: A date you assign to a task that doesn’t constrain the task’s 
timing. However, if a deadline date is assigned, Project displays an indicator 
symbol if the task runs past the deadline.
deliverable: A product or capability necessary to complete the project. 
dependency: A timing relationship between two tasks in a project. A depen­
dency link causes a task either to occur before or after another task, or to 
begin or end at some point during the life of the other task.
duration: The total number of work periods it takes to complete a task.
duration variance: The difference between the planned (baseline) task dura­
tion and the current estimated task duration, based on activity to date and 
any remaining activity still to be performed.
EAC (estimate at completion): The total planned cost for a specific task, 
work package, or project. This calculation combines the costs incurred to 
date with costs estimated for a task’s remaining work.
earned value: A reference to the value of work completed. A task with $1,000 
of associated costs has an earned value of $750 when it’s 75 percent complete. 
See also BCWP.

316
Project 2013 For Dummies 
earned value management: A project management technique that compares 
scope, schedule, and cost to measure project performance.
effort: The number of labor units required to complete a task. 
effort-driven: A setting for an auto-scheduled task that requires an assigned 
amount of effort to be completed. When you add resources to an effort-driven 
task, the assigned effort is distributed among the task resources equally.
enterprise custom fields: Custom fields stored in a global file. These fields 
can be used to standardize Project plan content across an organization.
Enterprise Resource Pool: A Project Server feature that allows you to save 
all resource information for resources used across an organization in one 
location.
exception: A specified date or date range that isn’t governed by the default 
working time calendar.
expand: To open a project outline to reveal both summary tasks and subtasks.
expected duration: An estimate of the actual duration of a task, based on 
work performance to date.
external task: A task in another project. You can set links between tasks in 
your project and external tasks.
File tab: The tab at the far left end of the Ribbon that you can click to access 
file- and program-related actions, such as opening a file or setting Project 
options, in the Backstage view. See also Backstage view.
finish date: The date on which a project or task is estimated to be — or 
actually is — completed.
finish-to-finish relationship: A dependency relationship in which the finish 
of one task determines the finish of another task.
finish-to-start relationship: A dependency relationship in which the finish of 
one task determines the start of another task.
fixed duration: For auto-scheduled tasks, a task type setting that specifies 
that the length of time required to complete a task remains constant no 
matter how many resources are assigned to the task. A half-day seminar is an 
example of a fixed-duration task.

317
 Appendix: Glossary
fixed-unit: A task type setting for auto-scheduled tasks that specifies that the 
resource units are constant; if you change the duration of the task, resource 
units don’t change. This is the default task type.
fixed-work: A task type setting for auto-scheduled tasks for which the 
number of resource hours assigned to the task determines its length. Fixed 
work tasks can’t be effort-driven.
float: The amount of time that you can delay a task before the task becomes 
critical. Float is used up when any delay in a task will delay the overall project 
deadline.
Gantt Chart view: A standard Project view that displays columns of task 
information alongside a chart that shows task timing in bar-chart format.
generic resources: A type of resource that allows you to make skill-based 
assignments based on a skill/code profile.
grouping: The organization of tasks by a customized field to summarize costs 
or other factors.
ID number: The number automatically assigned to a task by Project based on 
its vertical sequence in the project list. The ID number appears at the far left 
of the task’s row.
inactive: A task that still appears in the task list but is struck out and no 
longer considered in schedule calculations. Marking a task as inactive 
enables you to document planned activities that ultimately weren’t required 
for the project.
indent: To move a task to a lower level of detail in the project’s outline 
hierarchy.
lag: The set amount of delay that occurs between the end of one task and the 
beginning of another. Lag is built into a dependency relationship between 
tasks when you indicate that a certain amount of time must pass before 
the second task can begin. In other words, adding lag time creates a delay 
between tasks.
leveling: A calculation used by Project that modifies resource work assign­
ments for the purpose of resolving resource conflicts.
linking: To establish a connection between tasks in separate schedules so 
that task changes in the first schedule are reflected in the second; also, to 
establish dependencies among project tasks.

318
Project 2013 For Dummies 
manually scheduled: A new task mode where Project does not recalculate 
the task schedule based on changes in dependent tasks. You must manually 
reschedule tasks when using this mode. This is the default task scheduling 
mode in new project files.
material resources: The supplies or other items used to complete a task 
(one of two resource categories; the other is work resources).
milestone: A task that usually has zero duration, which marks an event in 
a schedule. By default, the Gantt chart shows a diamond marker for a mile­
stone task.
mini-toolbar: A toolbar that appears along with a shortcut menu to offer 
options such as formatting choices.
network diagram: A visual display of how all the tasks relate to one another.
Network Diagram view: An illustration that graphically represents workflow

work on any task in a project.
outdent: To move a task to a higher level in a project’s outline hierarchy.
overallocation: When a resource is assigned to spend more time on a single 
task or a combination of tasks occurring at the same than that resource’s 
work calendar permits.
overtime: Any work scheduled beyond a resource’s standard work hours. 
You can assign a different rate from a resource’s regular rate to overtime 
work.
parametric estimate: An estimating method that uses a mathematical model 
to determine project duration.
percent complete: The amount of work on a task that has already been 
accomplished, expressed as a percentage.
PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart: A standard proj­
ect management chart that indicates workflow among project tasks. This is a 
network diagram in Project. See also Network Diagram view.

319
Appendix: Glossary
predecessor: In a dependency link, the task designated to occur before 
another task. See also dependency and successor.
priority: A ranking of importance assigned to tasks. When you use resource 
leveling to resolve project conflicts, priority is a factor in the leveling calcula­
tion. A higher-priority task is less likely than a lower-priority task to incur a 
delay during the leveling process. See also resource leveling.
progress lines: Gantt Chart view bars that overlap the baseline task bar and 
allow you to compare the baseline plan with a task’s tracked progress.
project: A unique venture undertaken to produce distinct deliverables, 
products, or outcomes.
project calendar: The calendar assigned to the project file. All new tasks use 
this calendar by default unless you assign a different calendar to a particu­
lar task. The project calendar can be one of the default calendars built into 
Project — Standard, 24 Hours, or Night Shift — or a custom calendar that you 
create.
project management: The practice of organizing, managing, and controlling 
project variables to meet the project outcomes and mission.
Project Server: A network-based tool for managing projects across the enter­
prise. A project manager can use Project Professional to publish a project 
to Project Server. The project manager, team members, and stakeholders can 
then view and work with the project data stored in Project Server via a tool 
called Project Web App.
Project Web App: A web-based companion product of Microsoft Project 
Server that enables team members to enter information about their tasks 
into an overall project schedule without having Project installed on their own 
computers.
Quick Access Toolbar: A small, customizable toolbar above the Ribbon that 
offers buttons for the most frequently used commands.
recurring task: A task that will occur several times during the life of a proj­
ect. Regular project team meetings or quarterly inspections are examples of 
recurring tasks.
resource: A cost associated with a task. A resource can be a person, a piece 
of equipment, materials, or a fee.
resource-driven: A task whose timing is determined by the number of 
resources assigned to it.

320
Project 2013 For Dummies 
resource leveling: A process used to modify resource assignments to resolve 
resource conflicts.
resource pool: A group of resources created in a centralized location that 
multiple project managers can access and assign to their projects.
resource sharing: A feature that allows you to use resources you created in a 
resource pool in your current plan.
Ribbon: The bar at the top of Project that organizes commands on tabs.
risk: An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, affects the schedule 
(or another project objective, such as cost, resources, or performance).
roll up: The calculation by which all subtask values are rolled up — summa­
rized — in a single summary task.
rolling wave planning: Progressively elaborating the amount of detail in the 
plan for near-term work and keeping farther-out work at a higher level.
schedule variance (SV): The difference between the planned and actual dura­
tion or the planned and actual finish dates. When using earned value manage­
ment, SV is the difference between the earned value and the planned value, 
shown as EV–PV = SV.
scope: The work needed to produce the deliverables, products, or outcomes 
for the project.
shortcut menu: A contextual menu that presents applicable commands when 
you right-click an item in Project.
slack: The amount of time that you can delay a task before the task becomes 
critical. Slack is used up when any delay in a task will delay the overall project 
deadline.
split tasks: Tasks that have one or more breaks in their timing. When you 
split a task, you stop it partway and then start it again at a later time.
stakeholder: Those people who are affected by or can affect the project.
start date: The date on which a project or task begins.
start-to-finish relationship: A dependency relationship in which the start of 
one task determines the finish of another task.

321
 Appendix: Glossary
start-to-start relationship: A dependency relationship in which the start of 
one task determines the start of another task.
subproject: A copy of a second project inserted into a project. The inserted 
project becomes a phase of the project into which it is inserted.
subtask: A task that details a specific step in a project phase. This detail is 
rolled up into a higher-level summary task. A subtask is also called a subordi­
nate task. See also roll up.
successor: In a dependency relationship, the task whose schedule is dependent 
on the linked predecessor task’s schedule. See also dependency.
summary task: In a project outline, a task that has subordinate tasks. A sum­
mary task rolls up the details of its subtasks and has no timing of its own. 
See also roll up.
tab: A part of the Ribbon that you can click to display related tools and 
commands.
task: Also known as an activity, an individual step performed to reach a 
project’s goal.
task bar: A bar that graphically shows a task’s schedule according to the 
Timeline on the chart portion of Gantt Chart view. A task bar is also called a 
Gantt bar.
Team Planner view: A view that enables you to see and change assignments 
in a Timeline-like format.
template: A format in which a file can be saved. The template saves elements 
such as calendar settings, formatting, and tasks. New project files can be 
based on a template to save the time involved in reentering settings.
three-point estimate: An estimating method that accounts for uncertainty by 
averaging the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates. A three-point 
estimate may be modified by averaging the one optimistic, one pessimistic, 
and four most likely estimates.
Timeline view: A view that appears along with some other views to give a 
simplified picture of the overall schedule.
timescale: The area of Gantt Chart view that displays units of time. When the 
timescale is placed against those units of time, task bars graphically represent 
the timing of tasks.

322
Project 2013 For Dummies 
tracking: Recording the actual progress of work completed and the costs 
accrued for a project’s tasks.
user-controlled scheduling: A feature that enables you to select a task mode 
that controls how a task will be scheduled. See also automatically scheduled 
and manually scheduled.
variable rate: A shift in resource cost that can be set to occur at specific 
times during a project. For example, if a resource is expected to receive a 
raise or if equipment lease rates are scheduled to increase, you can assign 
variable rates for those resources.
WBS (work breakdown structure): A hierarchical representation of the 
project work. Each level represents a lower level of detail.
work resources: The people or equipment that performs work necessary to 
accomplish a task. See also material resources.
