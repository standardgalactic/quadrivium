About the Authors
Traci Cumbay: Traci cooks and eats quite a bit and then writes about
the experiences for publications in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she
lives with her husband and son.
Tom Schneider: Tom’s passion for authentic barbecue arose during
his high school days in Oklahoma and burgeoned over 20 years of
uncovering traditional barbecue joints while traveling the United
States. Tom is primarily a self-taught cook who, for the past decade,
has leveraged his commitment to barbecue into award-winning 
barbecue recipes while competing in sanctioned barbecue competi-
tions and formal barbecue judging. Tom is owner and pit master for
Poppi-Q Bar-B-Que, a specialty catering business in the Indianapolis
market.


Dedication
For Richard T. Brink, possibly the worst backyard cook ever to
hoist a beer near burning charcoal, and dearly missed.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Traci: Thanks first to Mike Baker, the acquisitions editor at
Wiley who about a year ago left a message on my voice mail asking
me whether I wanted to write “the coolest book ever.”
I’m seriously indebted to the unflappable and insightful Elizabeth
Kuball, the editor who kept me in line, kept me calm, and kept
making this book better.
And, especially, thanks to all the barbecue cooks who shared their
smarts and recipes for this book; to Brandon Hamilton and Anthony
Hanslits, the chefs who contributed some excellent and unique
touches; and to Rich Allen, who checked my work and gently
guided me back when I was off track.
From Tom: I’d like to thank all the purveyors of great barbecue
recipes and proven barbecuing techniques who heeded my plea to
share some of their very coveted and trusted knowledge. It is with
this generosity that we may continue to incubate future barbecue
aficionados for years to come.
A special thanks to the Baron of Barbecue, Mr. Paul Kirk, for his sig-
nificant contribution to our tasty recipes.

Introduction
B
ig talk surrounds barbecue, talk that would have you believe
the topic is impenetrable, that you should be content to pick
up a rack of ribs at the local rib shack and call it a day.
Nonsense.
Barbecue is like anything: Dig in and get your apron dirty, and you
start finding out what you need to know to keep getting better.
For many people, the pursuit of barbecue perfection becomes all-
consuming, edging out sleep and sex for brain space. For others,
pulling out the smoker to cook chickens on a sunny Saturday is
plenty. Both of these camps start out at the same place: square
one. This book picks up at exactly that spot. It tells you what you
need to know about barbecue cooking and then gives you the
recipes to put theory into practice.
Enjoy the ride — and the results.
About This Book
I wrote this book to be an easy-to-use reference. You’re welcome to
read it from cover to cover, but you don’t have to.
As you dig in, you find
 All the dirt on the equipment and techniques you need to cook
real-deal barbecue
 Tips from championship barbecue cooks and legendary
restaurateurs
 Inspirations for creating your own signature sauces and rubs
 Recipes for every stage of barbecue, and even for reimagining
leftovers

Conventions Used in This Book
As you work with the recipes in this book, remember the following
conventions:
 Spices are dried unless otherwise specified.
 Flour is all-purpose unless otherwise specified.
 Sugar is granulated unless otherwise noted.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (Refer to the appendix for
information about converting temperatures to Celsius.)
You also run into the following conventions throughout the text:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms
that I define.
 Monofont is used for Web and e-mail addresses.
 Sidebars, which are shaded boxes of text, consist of informa-
tion that’s interesting but not necessarily critical to your
understanding of the topic. I use them to share stories from
the barbecue circuit, hints about finding and using ingredi-
ents, and whatever else jumped to mind as I wrote.
What You’re Not to Read
This book is designed to give you just what you need to get cook-
ing. In some cases, though, I couldn’t resist providing a little fur-
ther information about a topic. Those tidbits show up in one of 
two ways, either of which is entirely skippable if you find you
aren’t searingly curious:
 Sidebars: The gray box around blocks of text indicate that you
can skip ahead.
 Technical Stuff icon: Any paragraph marked with the Technical
Stuff icon may be interesting to you, but it isn’t critical to your
understanding of barbecue.
Foolish Assumptions
In order to write this book, I had to keep in mind a few notions
about who you might be. I assume that you fit into one or more 
of the following categories:
BBQ Sauces, Rubs & Marinades For Dummies

 Someone who’s just getting started as an outdoor cook and
wants to make the experience as pleasant as possible by fol-
lowing a well-trod path
 A beginning cook who wants to expand his skills with some
time-tested tips and new recipes
 A barbecue enthusiast looking for some of the back story
about the dishes she loves to grub
 The smart-thinking spouse or friend of a barbecue cook who’s
giving this book as a gift in hopes of feasting on the fruits of
his purchase
How This Book Is Organized
You can easily find what you’re looking for in this book, whether
it’s a rundown of the types of wood you can use in your smoker or
a recipe for coleslaw. Here’s an outline of this book’s organization.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue 
Smarts in Four Chapters
A lot of big talk surrounds barbecue cooking, but the bottom line is
that anyone can do it. In this part, I give you all the information
you need to get started, explaining how the masters of barbecue
do what they do and how you, too, can find and use the equipment,
techniques, seasonings, and skills that produce fantastic eats.
Part II: Preparation Prevails: 
Using Rubs and Marinades
An important first step to great-tasting meat, using a rub adds flavor
and helps you develop a nice crust on the meat. Similarly, a good
soak in a balanced marinade can make a world of difference in your
barbecue. This part tells you about how rubs and marinades work,
gives you insight into concocting your own rubs and marinades,
and provides lots of great recipes.

Part III: The All-Important 
Sauce Story
Sauce is the big finish of barbecue and often the first thing that hits
the tongues of your guests. This part explains how you use various
sauces and shows you how to make a spectrum of sauces from
regional barbecue standards to exotic concoctions.
Part IV: Entrees and 
Sides and Then Some
Sides, salads, and salsas complement a great plate of barbecue,
and this part provides you inspiration for cooking up memorable
dishes to serve with your impressive ribs and brisket, some
recipes for dishes that break the barbecue mold, and others that
make use of barbecue leftovers.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Full of chapters that give you easily digestible tidbits of informa-
tion, this part alerts you to common barbecue mistakes and gives
you words to cook by. You find ten places to turn when you want
more information and ten hot barbecue competitions or festivals
where you can taste inspiration.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies signature icons are the little round pictures you see
in the margins of the book. They’re designed to draw your eye to
bits of information I really want to drive home. Here’s a list of the
icons you find in this book and what they mean:
Some points in these pages are so useful that I hope you keep them
in mind as you read. I make a big deal out of these ideas with this
icon.
The barbecue pros who contributed to this book have ages of
wisdom at the ready. When I relay the tidbits that can save you
time, money, or sanity, I emphasize them with this icon.

Wherever I point out possible missteps or potentially dangerous
practices, I use this icon to highlight the information. May you
experience neither burn nor unbalanced sauce.
If you’re the kind of person who thrives on detail or an overachiever
always on the lookout for extra credit, information marked by this
icon is for you. But you’re welcome to skip it; doing so won’t affect
your understanding of barbecue cooking.
Where to Go from Here
For Dummies books are set up so that you can flip to the section of
the book that meets your present needs, and this book is no excep-
tion. When I refer to a concept that I cover in greater detail else-
where in the book, I tell you which chapter to turn to, and I define
terms as they arise to enable you to feel at home no matter where
you open the book.
Looking for a great marinade? Turn to Part II. Interested in finding
out more about the difference between Memphis barbecue sauce
and the versions that come out of Kansas City? Chapter 1 gives you

A
n unmistakable reaction tears through my body when I get
barbecue on the brain. Just talking (or reading or even writ-
ing) about it incites a bone-deep craving, making my mouth water
and my stomach plead.
I know I’m not alone. Barbecue stirs up a visceral reaction every-
where you go, causing cravings that spur enthusiasts to drive all
night or get on a train to get their lips around their favorite ribs.
The passion that barbecue incites has created deep friendships
and broken others when spats over recipes heated to boiling. Ever
heard of chicken soup doing that?
Barbecue is a way of cooking, a party, or the food itself — succu-
lent servings of slow-cooked pork shoulder shredded and mixed
with sauce or dry-rubbed ribs with a crackling bark full of paprika,
cayenne, and cumin. It’s food for laid-back Sundays with friends or
raucous family gatherings, for baptisms and funerals and anything
in between. It’s a way of life for the cooks who travel from competi-
tion to competition and those who stay put, running generations-
old family restaurants. It’s no less lifeblood for the devotees who
make more-than-weekly trips to a favorite rib joint or for hobbyists
who cook their own barbecue at home.

In this chapter, I run through some of the theories about barbe-
cue’s origins and fill you in on the very basics of the cooking
method that begat the lifestyle.
First, There Was Fire
Before it became the holy grail of barbecue flavor, smoke was good
for keeping away the bugs, and the earliest Americans built fires
under their meat while they dried it on frames in the sun to pre-
serve it. Turns out the meat tasted better after the smoke wafted
into it, and so started the practice of infusing meat with the flavor
of smoke.
Believe that? You have no reason not to, and it’s at least as plausi-
ble as any of the 47 or so other theories about how barbecue came
to be.
The mysteries of barbecue extend far beyond the origin of the
word. (Does it come from the French for “whiskers to tail”? Is it a
description of the frames used for roasting meat over fire in the
West Indies? Dunno — and neither does anybody else.)
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
10
Smoking for preservation: 
How wood works wonders
Somewhere, somehow, some long-ago human figured out that drying food over smoke
kept it from rotting, at least for a while longer than doing nothing would have. Smoking
food worked well enough in pre-refrigeration days, but the reason wasn’t pinned
down until much later.
Heat sets free a number of organic acids (including acetic acid, or vinegar) from wood.
When those acids fly up onto the meat via smoke, they condense on its surface and
change the balance of the meat. The result is a surface pH level that’s too low for bac-
teria to be able to make themselves at home.
Wood smoke also is heavy in phenols — high-acidity compounds that prolong the
period of time before meats turn rancid.
As you may guess, not all the many chemicals in wood smoke are good for human con-
sumption or respiration. Lucky, then, that the low temperatures you use for slow smok-
ing don’t release as much of the unhealthy compounds from wood as high heat does.
Keeping the meat as far as you can from the wood as it smokes also cuts down on the
opportunity for the harmful compounds to get into the meat and, therefore, into you.

In the upcoming sections, I tell you a few things that are known,
believed, or completely fabricated about the start and progress of
barbecue. In the brazen and lively world of barbecue, lies and half-
truths are as good as facts. Sometimes better.
Facts and fibs about barbecue
Some do-it-yourselfers build smokers out of old refrigerators, which
is a little ironic: Had refrigeration become a part of everyday living
earlier, barbecue might not exist. Without it, people had to pre-
serve meat by salting the bejesus out of it or by smoking it, and
that smoking process opened the door for the pits and stands and
restaurants that do heady business today.
Barbecue first took hold in the American South and used primarily
pork because that’s what was available. As barbecue moved across
the country, urban conditions in Memphis led cooks to focus on
ribs, which took less time and space (and consequently, money) 
to cook.
In Texas, where cows are common as dust, beef brisket became 
the definition of barbecue. (I tell you about brisket and the other
common cuts of meat that are used in barbecue in Chapter 4.)
Heavy German influence in the area helped bring sausage into the
barbecue norm, and hot links (spicy smoked sausages) grew to be
another Texas barbecue trademark.
The best of all the barbecue traditions melded in Kansas City, and
restaurants and hobbyists all over the country maintained and
modified barbecue practices in search of their particular definition
of perfection. Many will tell you they’ve found it, and most of 
these “perfect” barbecue concoctions come from wildly different
approaches — including serving crackly pig skin in shredded pork
sandwiches; dousing ribs with sauce as a final touch while they’re
still on the heat (or cooking them in nothing but rub); and using
mustard-, vinegar-, or tomato-based sauces.
Everyone thinks his own barbecue is the best. Everyone is right.
From pit to pellet smoker
With scarce resources, resourceful settlers dug pits and cooked
their food over hot coals — a far cry from the high-tech barbecue
rigs that the pros use to mimic the results of those centuries-ago
methods.
Chapter 1: Faces of Barbecue: A Pit, a Plateful, a Party 11

Barbecue spread westward across the United States, just like
everything else, and morphed a bit along the way. (Check out 
the upcoming section, “Touring the Four All-American Barbecue
Regions.”) 
Holes in the ground gave way to homemade smokers cut from metal
barrels. Industrialization brought nicely engineered and executed
home charcoal smokers — and later, gas and electric models — into
mass production. (Chapter 2 tells you about the current options
for barbecue equipment.)
From its simple beginnings, barbecue has become, of all things, a
sport, drawing competitors from around the United States to week-
end contests where hundreds slave over mobile pits they paid
thousands of dollars for in hopes of taking home a trophy, a small
check, and big-time bragging rights. What a shock to anyone who
just wanted to be able to chew her meat without an overlong 
struggle.
Touring the Four All-American
Barbecue Regions
Great barbecue happens everywhere, but some human yen to codify
things begat four regions of barbecue in the United States. Each
region has some significance in the story of barbecue, but none is
entirely separate from the others. Although the differences among
them are a matter for considerable and vehement discussion, the
details of the traditions in the various regions have more in common
than they don’t. But try telling that to a Tennessean turning up his
nose at a Carolina-style, vinegar-sauced, shredded pork sandwich
with coleslaw on top.
Throughout this book, you find recipes for barbecue from each of
the regions (and from elsewhere). The following sections give you
some idea about how each area distinguishes itself.
Carolinas
Squealers fared well with little attention in the Carolina climate,
and barbecue from this region reflects that. Primarily pork, often
shoulder or whole hog, barbecue in the Carolinas most often means
sandwiches. Those sandwiches contain chopped pork from pretty
much every part of the pig, including the crackly skin.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
12

Pork in North Carolina is dressed with a touch of vinegary sauce in
the eastern part of the state, more generously mixed with vinegary
tomato sauce in the west.
Order barbecue in South Carolina and you’re most likely to find a
mustard-based sauce atop your shredded pork. Wherever you go,
it’s served on chewy white bread.
Memphis
Ribs are the crux of the Memphis barbecue tradition, and many 
pit masters there serve them dry (cooked with a rub but without
sauce). But dry isn’t the final word on ribs, and sweet, sticky sauce
tops a good portion of those you find in Memphis.
Ribs are a product of the move from the country into the cities as
farming became mechanized. Because they’re small, ribs cook
much more quickly, with less fuel, and in much less space than a
whole hog. Although ribs popped up quickly in other urban cen-
ters like Chicago and St. Louis, they are forever tied up tight with
Memphis barbecue.
Texas
Before same-day shipping to mega grocery stores, people cooked
what was available, and in Texas, what’s available is beef.
Beef brisket is the hallmark of Texas barbecue, which also strays
from the Memphis and Carolina styles by including ham and
sausage. Ribs make it onto barbecue platters here, too.
Brisket is a tough cut of meat that’s a challenge to master. True
Texas pit bosses took to the coarse, amply muscled cuts because
of the great finished product that slow smoking provides. They
usually give it a douse of rub (or just a sprinkle of salt and pepper)
before cooking it over mesquite, slice it across the grain, and serve
it with a side of smoky sauce and a slice of white bread.
Kansas City
That thick sauce you find in bottles, the one taking up most of the
shelf space in grocery stores’ barbecue sauce sections — that
sauce is the product of Kansas City.
Chapter 1: Faces of Barbecue: A Pit, a Plateful, a Party 13

Most everything else in Kansas City started somewhere else. Its spot
at the center of the country positioned it to be the melting pot of
barbecue styles, where brisket is as common as a rack of pork ribs.
One unique local offering is burnt ends, the bits of brisket from the
thin edges that cook quicker than the main part and hang tightly to
deep, smoky flavor.
Sauce is the end-all, be-all of barbecue in Kansas City, and sauce
means heavy on the tomatoes, light on spice, and full of tangy
sweetness. (Think KC Masterpiece, the biggest-selling sauce and 
a product of Kansas City physician Rich Davis.)
Smoke ’Em If You Got Time
The hallmarks of barbecue are smoke flavor and low-and-slow
cooking. Despite so many people insisting upon calling what they
do on their gas grill “barbecuing,” the practices behind barbecuing
and grilling are at odds: Grilling means hot-and-fast cooking and
barbecue is its opposite.
Barbecue requires patience at just about every step of the process,
from adding a dry rub to the meat before you cook it to letting meat
sit a spell before you cut into it.
True barbecue is slow
Barbecue cooking may have come about in part as a form of multi-
tasking. Carolinians cooked whole hogs over low heat because it
was the best way to ensure that every last bit got cooked without
ruining any of the faster-cooking parts. Legend says they also did 
it because doing so enabled the cook to run off and see to other
tasks.
Barbecue cooking requires a temperature somewhere around 250
degrees. (Significant argument surrounds the “correct” cooking
temperature. Some argue for 300 degrees or so, others for some-
thing in the neighborhood of 180 degrees. As long as you keep the
temperature from fluctuating, you can cook great barbecue at about
any stop along that range.) By contrast, you grill using a fire that’s
a good 500 degrees.
Barbecue cooking also owes something to poverty. If everybody in
the South had been able to afford tender cuts of meat, high-and-
fast cooking would’ve been fine. The need to turn the dregs of a pig
into something tender and tasty brought about the slow-cooking
technique.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
14

Cooking meat slowly, at low temperatures, is what makes tough
meat tender. Slow cooking gives meat’s fat time to render and its
connective tissue time to break down. Both those processes lead
to softer, easier-to-chew, and more delectable cooked meats.
The story behind your pulled pork sandwich may not be entirely
appetizing, but the result is the reason people travel hundreds of
miles or plan their vacations around their favorite barbecue spots.
True barbecue is smoked
Without smoke, there is no barbecue. Smoking means adding sea-
soned hardwood to a fire so that it heats up and smokes, releasing
its flavor into the meat.
The smoke flavor that ends up in your ribs or brisket depends on
the wood you use; pecan is going to give a flavor much different
from apple, for example.
You add wood usually in the form of chunks or smaller chips that
have been chopped and dried for the express purpose of flavoring
your barbecue. Then again, you can run around your backyard
picking up sticks from under your oak tree and throw those onto
the fire.
One of the hallmarks of slow-smoked meat is a pink ring and, in
many cases, a pink tinge throughout the meat. The ring around the
edges of the meat comes about because of the gasses released from
the smoking wood, which react with the muscle tissue to create the
color. A pink tinge in deeper areas arises because of the way the
proteins within the meat unfold at lower temperatures. Cook at high
temperatures, and the meat’s color seeps out early, but when the
meat creeps up on the temperature required to loosen the pigment,
the color has nowhere to go because the other elements of the
meat have already settled in and shut themselves off.
In Chapter 2, you can find out everything you need to know about
using wood when you cook.
Making the Most of the Meat
You can accomplish a lot in the way of tenderizing and adding
smoke flavor to meat by cooking at low temperatures over char-
coal and wood. You achieve even better results when you mix up
some marinade or a great rub to work a little cayenne or curry into
the meat.
Chapter 1: Faces of Barbecue: A Pit, a Plateful, a Party 15

In the following sections, I tell you about the three most-used
methods for giving zing to any meat you cook.
Seasoning with rubs
A rub is a dry marinade that you sprinkle or pat onto meat before
you cook it. Rubs can contain just about anything, and they usually
include some salt and sugar. You leave them on for a few minutes
before you cook or as long as overnight. As meat cooks, the heat
pulls open its pores, and the flavors of the rub seep right in.
Rubs help produce bark, a crisp and flavorful crust that also helps
hold in meat’s moisture.
You find out more about rubs in Chapter 5; Chapter 6 gives you
recipes for rubs of all kinds.
Marinating: The power and the glory
Marinade, a light liquid that you soak meat in before you cook it,
does as much good for the texture of meat as it does for the flavor.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
16
Converting barbecue techniques 
for backyard grilling
This book is about barbecue, and most of the recipes within it come from true barbe-
cue pit masters, but you’re cordially invited to do with the information you find here
whatever your heart and stomach desire.
If you want to oven-roast a chicken dressed up in one of the rubs you find in
Chapter 6, knock yourself out. If you think shrimp would do nicely doused in one
of the marinades from Chapter 7 and then plunked on the grill, you might just be
onto something. Want to dip french fries in one of the rich, tomatoey sauces from
Part III? Please do.
Any cook worth his sea salt is an innovator. Every technique in this book was new at
some point, and there’s not a reason under the sun why you shouldn’t feel free to exper-
iment, as well.
If you want to try cooking true barbecue but aren’t interested in investing in another
piece of cooking equipment for your backyard, try utilizing your grill as a smoker. It
requires no special equipment but aluminum foil, and I show you how to do it in
Chapter 2.

Most marinades are made up of an acid (vinegar, lemon juice, or
some such) and an oil. The acid helps break down the fibers to ten-
derize the meat, and oil helps hold the acid against the meat so it
can do the most good. The rest is flavor — whatever combination
of seasonings you like.
Marinades tend to work fast, propelling a lot of flavor and good
tenderizing effect into meat. They can be vehicles for intense
tastes or subtle ones.
I tell you more about marinades in Chapter 5. In Chapter 7, you find
recipes for marinades both traditional and exotic.
The big finish: Sauces
You can call pretty much anything liquid a sauce, and depending
on who or where you are, your definition of true barbecue sauce
may be very different. (Get a taste of those differences in “Touring
the Four All-American Barbecue Regions,” earlier in this chapter.)
Different kinds of sauces are appropriate at different stages of the
cooking process. You don’t put a sugary sauce on food before it
has been cooked through, for example, because it burns right
around it.
In Chapter 8, I fill you in on the ways you create and use various
kinds of sauces. Then in Chapters 9 through 11, I give you a slew of
recipes for sauces of all kinds from each of the barbecue regions
and beyond.
How the Big Guns of Barbecue 
Do What They Do
Prying pointers out of barbecue cooks is no easy task. Secretiveness
is part of the fun and show of barbecue. Cooks guard their sauce
recipes and rub mixtures with the ferocity of a mother bear guard-
ing her cubs, but they throw in taunts and flat-out lies to toy with
their predators.
Are the recipes in this book exactly as their authors make them?
Hardly. You can bank on their being amended just enough so that
you get a great result that’s not quite the one the recipe’s author
gets. (All the more reason to play around and make it your own, 
as I recommend in the upcoming section, “Getting Creative As You
Cook.”)
Chapter 1: Faces of Barbecue: A Pit, a Plateful, a Party 17

Despite all the big talk and the energy spent hanging on to signa-
ture recipes, the truth of the matter is this: About 95 percent of
what everybody does is the same. The nuances make for different
flavors, slightly juicier meat, a nominally sweeter smoke flavor, and
a ton of bullshitting over beers.
So, no, you don’t get every detail you might want from a successful
barbecue cook, but you get what you need. In the upcoming chap-
ters, I share that information with you — details about choosing
wood for smoking, as well as balancing a rub, marinade, or sauce,
and more.
Concocting rubs and sauces
Even though sauce recipes are held precious, the basic formula for
creating sauces gives you everything you need to know to start
working out your own recipe (which you, in turn, can refuse to
share).
Any sauce starts with a base that provides the underlying flavor
and holds everything together. That base may be ketchup, vinegar,
mustard, tomato paste, chili sauce, or anything along those lines
(or a combination of all of them). From there, add some sweetness
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
18
Tomato or not tomato — that is the question
Barbecue may well have been around since the 17th century, and although tomatoey
barbecue sauce has for much of the eating (if not barbecue-cooking) public become
synonymous with barbecue, tomatoes were a much later introduction to the cooking
style.
Although plenty of evidence shows that they were eaten elsewhere earlier, tomatoes
didn’t become a staple in American kitchens until the mid-19th century. That may be
because of legends that they were poisonous. Depending on whom you ask, that myth
took hold because the plant is a member of the nightshade family, which includes truly
poisonous plants, or because the high acid content caused lead to leach out of flatware
and cause sickness.
Another legend has it that Puritans turned up their noses at the tomato because it was
thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. (In French, the tomatoes were referred to as
pommes d’amour, or love apples.)
Tomatoes therefore came late to barbecue (but came with a vengeance, if the lineup of
sauces on grocery store shelves is to be believed). The first settlers in the eastern region
of the Carolinas wouldn’t have even considered adding tomatoes to their sauces. To
this day, the preference in the Carolinas is for vinegar- or mustard-based sauces.

with sugar or molasses, and then throw in the spices you like. I
give you a lot more detail about building sauces in Chapter 8, 
and you find sauce recipes of every stripe in the rest of Part III.
They may not admit it to you, but a lot of competitive barbecue
cooks start out with bottled sauce and doctor it to their taste.
Playing around with a sauce you know and enjoy is an easy way to
start experimenting without investing too much time in building
sauce from scratch.
Rubs follow more or less the same formula, starting with some-
thing fairly neutral that will mix easily with the primary flavors you
want in the rub. Paprika generally fills this slot. To that, you add
salt, sugar, and whatever combination of spices tickles your fancy.
You want something with a little kick, like cayenne pepper, chili
powder, or even curry powder, and you want some lower-profile
seasonings like cumin, black pepper, or garlic powder. You can toy
around with it easily until you like the way it hits your tongue.
Chapter 5 runs down the finer points of putting together a solid
rub from scratch.
From meat to magic
The slow-cooking process that takes even the saddest cut of meat
and turns it into a dream-invading delicacy relies on time and a
steady temperature. The equipment you use to make that happen
depends on how much and how often you intend to cook, along
with how much money you want to spend.
The unfortunate fact is that the less-expensive versions actually
require the most barbecue smarts to produce great results. Spend
more money, and you usually get better temperature control.
Without that, you end up a slave to your thermometer, regularly
checking in and adjusting your vents or adding charcoal to bring
the temperature back to its sweet spot.
Reasonably good barbecue smokers start out at around $200, and
high-end equipment can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars.
You find out about choosing a smoker in Chapter 2. Using one to 
its best advantages is a topic I cover in Chapter 4.
Getting Creative As You Cook
Color me slow, but I’d been out on my own for several years before
I figured out that a recipe was just a suggestion, not a make-or-break
Chapter 1: Faces of Barbecue: A Pit, a Plateful, a Party 19

set of dictates. Cooking became a lot more fun when I realized that
tripling the garlic or cutting back on sugar were fine-and-dandy
ideas that led to results that I preferred over the original recipes.
This book has a ton of recipes, but cooking that’s limited to a list 
of directions has little pleasure in it. I hope you use this book as 
a jumping-off point to creating the rub, sauce, or marinade that
strikes you just right.
Behind every great recipe: 
An experiment
Chocolate chips came about because Ruth Graves Wakefield tried 
a last-minute substitution. Thinking semisweet chocolate would
melt into her cookie batter, she was surprised to pull from her
oven blonde cookies with chocolate bits sprinkled throughout
them. That was in the 1930s. Today, chocolate chip cookies are 
the world’s most popular.
No doubt some experiments yield results you couldn’t, in good
conscience, feed to friends. Even if only one out of five tries gave
you something to brag about, going out on a limb would pay off.
But by using the advice in this book, which includes basic tenets 
to blend rubs and marinades by (Chapter 5) and standards by
which to stir up sauces (Chapter 8), you have all the information
you need to proceed down the do-it-yourself route without worry.
When you have a little information about how and why the compo-
nents of barbecue do what they do, you can confidently put your
own signature on any of them. Barbecue is all about bragging
rights. You can’t earn them without a little experimentation.
Benefiting from others’ 
trial and error
Turns out mint doesn’t belong in a spice rub. It gets bitter and
doesn’t play well with other common seasonings. Now you know,
and you don’t have to make that mistake.
Given that barbecue has been a mainstay of American cuisine for
centuries, a lot of knowledge has built up around it (despite cooks’

Others’ missteps mean you’re every bit as free to experiment but
can do so with less fear of retribution from the tasters. This book
gives you advice and recipes you can rely on to make cooking as
fun as eating.
Incorporating contemporary 
and exotic recipes
Many of the techniques that are now intrinsic to barbeque started
out in other areas of the world or drew upon cooking knowledge
passed through centuries and from family to family or culture to
culture. But cooking techniques and trends change all the time —
especially given the current boom of food TV and the endless 
food-centered Web sites and blogs.
If you’re cooking to satisfy a barbecue competition judge, you’ll
follow a strict set of rules outlining what barbecue really is and is
not, but if you’re cooking just to satisfy yourself and your friends,
then the only rules that matter are yours.
The recipes in this book pull some long-lost influences back into
the barbecue fold and throw in some modern twists, too, by calling
on a couple great chefs who know at least as much about how bar-
becue happens in Korea as they do about Carolina or Memphis
methods.
Experimentation is a big part of the spirit of barbecue, and I hope
you find in this book the inspiration and means for running some
experiments of your own.

Equipment
In This Chapter
 Choosing your weapon: Smokers and grills
 Getting the lowdown on charcoal
 Barking up the right tree: Wood for smoking
 Having on hand the right tools for each stage of the game
U
nless you’re strictly a microwave “cook,” you probably
already have much of the equipment you need to get started
with the recipes in this book. Barbecue isn’t so esoteric that you
have to run out and buy a bunch of special tools to give it a go.
If you end up taking to barbecue (and be warned, it becomes an
obsession or even a lifestyle for a pretty high percentage of harm-
less dabblers), you have no end of options for upgrading and
expanding your tool kit, and more show up on the market almost
daily.
In the meantime, start small. This chapter gives you what you need
to know about the tools that are essential for barbecue cooking,
and it fills you in on some of the options for the bigger, better,
badder equipment that you may want to check into down the line.
Although a superfancy, high-end smoker looks awfully sexy and
comes with features that you may find useful, some of the world’s
best barbecue comes off a homemade barrel smoker — the very
antithesis of high-tech equipment. If you understand the concepts
behind barbecue, you can make it happen in the most dire of
equipment circumstances.

Settling on a Smoker
Back in ye olden days, people dug a pit to smoke meats, so don’t
think you have to drop a heap of dollars on your equipment. Using
less-expensive options may mean that you have to work a little
harder and be a little more watchful to keep the temperature steady.
What it doesn’t mean is that you can’t cook great barbecue, so
don’t be a sissy. As I show you, even a charcoal grill can serve as 
a smoker.
The following sections give you some ideas about what you can 
do with the various kinds of equipment available and what makes
them desirable or not.
Rigging a charcoal grill
Using a charcoal grill as a smoker is a good way to test the barbe-
cue waters. If you find you enjoy smoking, you’re likely to want to
upgrade, but a large kettle grill with a lid is a reasonable starting
point.
The main difference between grilling and barbecue is that when
you grill, you cook directly over the heat source. Barbecue cooking
uses indirect heat. To make that happen in a grill, do the following:
1. Prepare your heat source.
Use a chimney starter (see “Using a chimney starter,” later
in this chapter) to light your charcoal.
2. Place the charcoal.
When it’s ready, heap the hot charcoal onto only one side
of the kettle’s bottom grate, leaving the other side free for
the meat.
3. Add wood.
Put soaked wood chunks or an aluminum-foil packet of
wood chips directly onto the coals, as Figure 2-1 shows
you. (Check out “Using wood to add flavor,” later in this
chapter, for more details)
4. Get ready to cook.
Place the top grate onto the kettle and give it a few minutes
to heat up.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
24

Figure 2-1: A kettle grill set up for smoking. Note that the charcoal is piled onto
one side instead of across the bottom grate, as it would be for grilling.
5. Throw your meat on the grate, carefully.
Place your meat on the side of the grill opposite the char-
coal. Figure 2-2 shows you how your setup should look.
6. Close the lid to smoke the meat.
Leave the vents or intake partially open to keep oxygen
moving over the charcoal and to encourage good circula-
tion of the heat throughout the grill. Adjust the upper vent
or exhaust above the meat and opposite the fire to draw
heat and smoke toward the meat.
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 25

Figure 2-2: Keep your meat out of the direct line of the heat source when you
use your charcoal grill as a smoker.
Check the temperature intermittently by inserting a candy
thermometer into the vent on the grill’s lid. (Make sure the
vent is positioned over the food that you’re cooking so you
know you’re reading the temperature where you’re most
concerned about it.) Open the vents farther to increase
heat, and narrow them to decrease it. Add more charcoal 
if you need to increase the heat by several degrees.
Because the heat is on only one side of the grill, you need to move
your meat regularly so that each piece gets roughly the same
amount of time next to the charcoal. Doing so helps you cook your
food evenly.

26

Buying a charcoal smoker
You most often run into two varieties of charcoal smokers for
home cooks on the commercial market:
 Vertical smoker: A vertical smoker (sometimes called a bullet
smoker because of its shape; see Figure 2-3) is one of the all-
time most popular smokers and not terribly hefty in size or
cost. You use it by cooking a significant distance over the heat
and with a water pan in between the heat source and the
cooking grate to keep the meat moist.
 Offset horizontal smoker: An offset horizontal smoker (see
Figure 2-3) keeps the fire in a compartment separate from the
meat. You have a large cooking surface and vents to control
the heat and keep it moving through the cooking chamber.
Figure 2-3: On a vertical smoker (left), the meat cooks far above the heat. An
offset horizontal smoker separates the fire and the cooking surface.
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 27

Building a barrel smoker
A do-it-yourself option if you’re industrious, a barrel smoker makes
use of a 55-gallon drum turned on its side and split down the middle
(see Figure 2-4). This type of smoker is the definition of inexpen-
sive, but it’s fickle to use and doesn’t last terribly long. It does have
a heckuva cowboy quality, if that’s what you’re into. A number of
Web resources are available to show you how to turn a barrel into
a smoker; you can find a particularly thorough version for building
a double-barrel smoker at www.mikesell.net/smoker.
Figure 2-4: A barrel smoker is the rustic version of commercial horizontal 
smokers.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
28

Using an electric or gas smoker
Take charcoal out of the equation, and you lose a lot of the great
smoke flavor that makes barbecue an obsession for eaters and
cooks. You can use wood with an electric or gas smoker (see
Figure 2-5), but the effect is just not the same. (Although some bar-
becue cooks argue this point, as they do nearly every other point,
most prefer to cook with charcoal to enhance the flavor of the
smoke.)
Figure 2-5: You find gas and electric smokers in a range of styles.
What you gain from electric or gas smokers is easier-to-control
heat. Instead of messing with adding charcoal, you just adjust a
dial. Shazam!
Fire, Starters: Managing Heat
In most cases, you use charcoal as your heat source, and you use
wood to add smoke and flavor. Why not use wood as heat and
smoke, you ask? Because oversmoking is a common mistake when
you try to kill two birds with one pile of wood — you have better
luck and better smoke and heat control if you use charcoal. Use
too much smoke, and you’re likely to end up with a very unwel-
come bitterness in your meat.
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 29

Eyeing charcoal types
You can buy charcoal in two varieties, both of which have their
enthusiasts:
 Charcoal briquettes: Made from charred hardwood and coal,
charcoal briquettes are the most commonly used medium for
backyard grilling. Briquettes are in many cases eschewed by
serious barbecue cooks because of the additives that are com-
pressed into them to keep the briquettes burning and hold
them together.
 Lump charcoal: Made from charred hardwood and nothing
else, lump charcoal doesn’t have the additives you find in
charcoal briquettes (nor does it have the smooth shape —
hence, the name). Lump charcoal burns hotter and faster than
briquettes. You pay more for it, but depending on the sensitiv-
ity of the meat you’re cooking, lump charcoal may be worth
the expense for the lack of chemical additives that may flavor
the meat.
If you choose to use charcoal briquettes (and plenty of great bar-
becue cooks do), make sure you avoid the kind with the lighter
fluid built right in. The chemicals that help you light it burn right
off the briquettes and waft into your food, giving it an acrid taste
that only a masochist is going to find delightful. Using lighter fluid
straight from the squeeze bottle is a bad idea as well and for the
same reason. Check out the next section, “Using a chimney starter,”
to find out the best way to get charcoal burning without adding
unwanted flavor.
Using a chimney starter
Through the magic of a chimney starter, you can light charcoal
easily and quickly without pouring on the lousy-tasting chemicals
you find in lighter fluid. You can buy a chimney starter (see 
Figure 2-6) at most hardware or home-supply stores.
You use it by stuffing newspaper into the bottom section and filling
the top section with charcoal. Set it in a safe place and light the
newspaper. In 15 to 20 minutes, your coals are ready to go. Just
dump them into the smoker.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
30

Figure 2-6: A chimney starter gets your coals ready for cooking without adding
chemicals.
Determining how much 
charcoal you need
The amount of charcoal that you use varies according to whether
you go for the lump or briquette variety and what and how much
you’re cooking. That’s a lot of variables, and finding just the right
amount of charcoal for reaching your target temperature takes
some practice.
Increasing heat is easier than reducing it, so proceed cautiously
with charcoal. Start out with slightly less than you think you need
and add more if it becomes necessary.
Wood: To Hickory or Not to Hickory
The meat of the matter, when it comes to barbecue, actually is the
wood. Smoke gives barbecue its unique flavor, and you get the
smoke from putting hardwood between your charcoal and your
meat so that the slow-burning wood sends its heavenly smoke up
into whatever you’re cooking.
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 31

Using wood to add flavor
You can add wood to your grill or smoker in a couple different
forms:
 Chips are small pieces along the lines of mulch. Wrap them in
heavy-duty aluminum foil and tear several holes in the foil to
give the smoke a route out of the packet and onto your meat.
A word of warning: Fish easily picks up a metallic flavor from
the foil, so if you’re planning to smoke fish, you may want to
use wood chunks instead.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
32
Charcoal quantity: What’s right for 
a butt may be wrong for a chop
The amount of charcoal you use depends on the density and weight of the meat you’re
cooking, and the efficiency of the smoker you use. As an example, in Tom’s Weber
Smokey Mountain Cooker, a metal ring at the base of the smoker sits on a rack. He typ-
ically smokes two to three pork butts at a time, each with an average weight of 6
pounds, so that’s 12 to 18 pounds of pork. For that amount of meat, he fills the ring to
the top, fills a chimney starter (check out the section “A Mop, Some Tongs, and So
On,” later in this chapter), lights that charcoal, and when it’s hot, dumps it on top of the
ring of briquettes.
“All said. I use about 65 percent of an 18-pound bag of briquettes,” Tom explains. “It
gets me about 12 hours of smoking, holding the temp to about 95 percent of the origi-
nal set-point temperature. The smokers I use are extremely efficient with a fuel source.
In fact I can put five butts (30 pounds) on that smoker with the same amount of coals.”
Things change considerably if the smoker isn’t as efficient. Tom remembers smoking
about 70 pounds of meat on a custom rig: “It took me three bags — 54 pounds — of
coals to smoke that for 12 hours,” he said. “Very inefficient. If I smoked 70 pounds of
meat across two units like mine, I could do it with about 30 total pounds of coals. My
competition units ($225 apiece) are much more efficient than the custom, and larger
capacity rig, I used ($6,000!).”
Meat density is another variable to consider. A pork butt is the size of a football and very
dense. Say it weighs about 6 pounds, meaning you need about 12 hours to smoke it.
Three slabs of ribs with bones weigh 6 pounds, too, but they need only 4 to 6 hours to
smoke. Cook 18 1⁄3-pound pork chops, and that particular 6 pounds’ worth of meat needs
only 3 to 4 hours on the smoker. 
The single butt takes 8 pounds of briquettes; the pork chops and ribs need only about
3 to 4 pounds of briquettes. Tom’s rough rule of thumb: About a dozen briquettes for a
pound of meat minus the bone weight to slow-cook meat.

 Chunks are good-sized pieces of wood that are 3 or 4 inches
across. Before you use them, soak them in cold water for half
an hour to an hour. Drain off the excess water and then place
the chunks right on top of your charcoal.
Avoid using softwood to smoke meat. Pine trees and other conifers
smell great, but they do terrible things to the taste of meat. Any
seasoned hardwood is fair game. The next section, “Describing
characteristics of woods,” gives you a rough idea of what different
woods will do for your barbecue.
Describing characteristics of woods
You carefully choose your marinade, your meat, your rub — and
the decisions don’t stop there. The type of wood you use to smoke
meat affects the way it tastes.
Here’s a rundown of the characteristics you find in different types
of wood:
 Almond or pecan wood imparts a mild, nutty (surprise!) taste.
 Apple and cherry woods do what their fruits would: They
give a sweet, fruity flavor.
 Hickory provides an intense flavor; be careful not to use too
much.
 Maple is mild and versatile, and its smoke is a little sweet.
 Oak is a finicky option because it has a distinct flavor that can
easily come across too strong.
 Walnut comes off as bitter if you use too much of it. Better to
use it restrainedly and with a milder choice, like one of the
fruit woods.
A Mop, Some Tongs, and So On
Ours is an age of excess. Along with completely unnecessary tools
for golfers, wine drinkers, and virtually every other hobbyist from
hunters to knitters, barbecue cooks have a steady stream of new
and “life-altering” gadgets to choose from. Some of these options
may tempt you mightily, but very few of them do you actually need.
In this section, I run down the equipment you’ll use over and 
over in your barbecue cooking.
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 33

Make sure you get your hands on the following before you begin
cooking:
 Smoker or grill: You get a rundown of your smoker options 
in the “Settling on a Smoker” section, earlier in this chapter.
There, I also tell you how to use your grill to approximate the
effect of a smoker so you can try it out before committing to
the cost of buying your own.
 Fire: You need matches or a long butane lighter to get your
charcoal going.
 Charcoal: I tell you everything you need to know about your
heat source in the “Fire, Starters: Managing Heat” section, ear-
lier in this chapter.
 Chimney starter: A chimney starter is the best way to get
your charcoal going. (Check out the “Using a chimney starter”
section, earlier in this chapter, to get the details on chimney
starters.”)
 Tongs and a long-handled metal spatula: Only suckers turn
meat with a fork. You don’t want to pierce it and let the juices
run out. Tongs or spatulas (see Figure 2-7) let you move meat
without damaging it.
Figure 2-7: Tongs or spatulas enable you to turn meat without poking holes in it.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
34

 Basting brush or mop: Choose a sturdy brush or buy a cotton
basting mop (see Figure 2-8), which gives you great coverage
quickly — a plus considering you’re working hard to maintain
a steady temperature.
 Thermometer: If your smoker doesn’t have a built-in ther-
mometer, stick a candy thermometer into a vent. You find digi-
tal, dial, and notched versions (see Figure 2-9). Take your pick;
they all suit your purposes just fine.
 Grill brush: No matter how spectacular your last batch of ribs
was, it’s not going to taste good on today’s chicken. A gunked-
up grate makes meat stick and causes you extra headache
because you have to keep the lid open longer and lose valu-
able heat while you wrestle the meat as you move it during
cooking. A thorough scrape with a grill brush (see Figure 2-10)
goes a long way toward maintaining the flavor of your food
and keeping it from sticking.
Figure 2-8: A well-made brush or basting mop allows you to quickly sauce 
whatever you’re cooking.

36

 Drip pan: Dripping fat and charcoal are not a good combina-
tion. Keep the two separate by using a drip pan. A pie tin or
cake pan or a pan you fashion from heavy-duty aluminum foil
works great.
 Spray bottle: Use a spray bottle to discourage flames that
may lick up from your grill or to add moisture to meat as you
smoke it.
 Apron: In addition to making you look sexy, aprons give you a
place to stash your tongs and a way to save your clothes from
all manner of stains.
 Heat-resistant gloves: Big cuts of meat need hands-on atten-
tion, which means you need heat-resistant gloves so you can
move them.
 Heavy-duty aluminum foil: You use foil to wrap meat before
you cook it and to keep the meat hot for residual cooking after
it’s out of the smoker or off the grill.
 Plastic wrap: You need it to cover marinating meat or for stor-
ing cooked food.
 Glass bowls: When you marinate meat, do it in a glass con-
tainer. Stainless steel works, too, but steer clear of aluminum
or cast iron, which react with the marinade and knock it out of
whack.
 Sharp knives: You’re going to need to trim your meat with
some precision and in some cases around tricky terrain. A
boning knife gets into hard-to-navigate spots, and an 8-inch
chef’s knife works well for outside trimming (see Figure 2-11).
Chapter 2: Gathering Must-Have Equipment 37
Estimating temperature in a pinch
If ever you find yourself without a thermometer but otherwise ready to cook, no need
to run out for a replacement — use the “hands-on” method to estimate the temper-
ature of your heat source. Hold your hand approximately 5 to 6 inches above the
coals; the amount of time you can stand to keep it there tells you your temperature
range. If you can hold your hand above the coals for
 1 to 2 seconds, the coals are hotter than 500 degrees
 3 to 4 seconds, you’re working with medium grill heat at about 350 to 400 degrees
 6 seconds or so, and you’ve got smoking heat — 250 degrees or less

You can use whatever knives you feel comfortable with — just
make sure they’re sharp. Dull knives not only make trimming a
challenge, they also put you in danger of gouging yourself as
you fight through the meat.
Figure 2-11: A chef’s knife and a flexible boning knife are good choices for 
trimming fat from meat.

arbecue comes very close to turning the sow’s ear of
metaphor into a silk purse. It takes otherwise unpleasant-
to-eat cuts of meat and turns them delicious. Still, starting with 
the right ingredients makes the alchemy more certain.
If you’re going to put forth the effort to cook, give your energies
their due by using the best ingredients you can get your hands on.
That doesn’t necessarily mean spending a fortune, but it does mean
choosing wisely. This chapter equips you to start your meals right
with a foundation of great ingredients.
You put a lot of time and energy into your cooking, so give your
efforts their due by using ingredients that support rather than 
supplant them.
Finding Meat That Makes the Cut
How you plan to cook has a lot to do with the cut of meat you want
to buy. Anything cut from the midsection of an animal’s back —
tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs, for example — works best when it’s
cooked quickly, over high heat. (For grilling or searing, common
knowledge says that you stay as far as possible from the hoof and
the horns. That pretty much leaves the middle of the back.)

Cuts of meat that come from the part of the animal that did most of
the work (the shoulders and legs) are just right for barbecue cook-
ing, which breaks down the tough muscle by keeping it over low
heat for a good long time.
The front of an animal is the part that does the work and, there-
fore, has the strongest muscle. More muscle means more collagen,
and more collagen means less tenderness. Enter barbecue:
Cooking muscle-heavy cuts of meat for a long time over low heat
breaks down the collagen.
More fat means more flavor
Fat means energy for a living animal, which builds stores of the
stuff. And for an animal that later takes a turn as food, that same
fat means flavor and moisture. Without it, meat tends toward the
tough, bland, and dry.
Muscle fibers have much the same consistency from animal to
animal. Muscles do what they do in the same manner, whether that
project is powering a wing or driving a lope across the meadow. Fat
cells are where the differences among meat come into play. Because
they’re the closets of biochemistry, storing any fat-soluble matter
the animal takes in, they reflect the animal’s eating habits and the
intestinal microbes (microscopic organisms that contribute to
digestion, as well as the fungi and viruses that cause illness) that
make it into its digestive tract.
Because fat stores hang onto food energy, they also maintain any
flavor from that food that’s fat soluble. You see “grass-fed” adver-
tised so often on beef packaging because that diet is not just more
natural for the cattle but tends to produce a more flavorful beef.
Big sheets of fat serve a purpose on cuts like brisket, which has a
blanket of fat that covers the cut. (Check out the upcoming
“Brisket” section.) That fat layer melts as the brisket heats up and
drips down into the meat to keep it flavorful and moist. 
What you want in every cut of pork, lamb, or beef is good 
marbling — the network of meandering veins of thin fat that run
throughout the cut. This kind of fat feeds the meat moisture and
flavor, giving it a toothsome texture.
As animals age, they build stores of fat in their muscles as energy
reserves. These stores show up as thick deposits in the meat, and
they aren’t as beneficial as the thinner, more evenly distributed
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
40

marbling that you want to look for. The veins of fat break up the
strong, chewy muscle tissue and add juiciness as they melt during
cooking.
Fresher is better
After meat is portioned and packaged, it’s delicate as a diva, easily
falling prey to bacteria, unsavory flavors in your fridge, and 
oxidation.
Refrigeration slows down meat’s inevitable decay, and freezing
temporarily stops it. But freezing is hard on meat. Low tempera-
tures irretrievably change meat’s composition, and the difference
shows up as less-tender meat: Ice crystals grow from the meat’s
juices and drill holes that later leak the precious fluids that keep
meat from becoming tough as it cooks.
And then there’s freezer burn, the discoloration that arises from
extreme loss of moisture after meat has spent too much time in the
freezer. Freezer-burnt meat inevitably has a tough texture and sus-
pect flavor.
No matter what meat you’re buying, don’t forget to eyeball the sell-
by date on the label to make sure that day hasn’t come and gone.
Making friends with your butcher certainly doesn’t hurt.
Customers of local butcher shops generally find services and perks
they’d never have expected from large chain meat counters.
Running Down the Options, 
Cut by Cut
The beauty of barbecue is that it’s infinitely adaptable, so this sec-
tion by no means gives you the full spectrum of meat cuts, but it
does give you an introduction to the most-cooked cuts for tradi-
tional barbecue cooking.
Pork
Look for pork that has a faint pink color. Darker meat means older
meat: Either it came from an older pig that had more time to
develop tough muscle, or it was cut and exposed to air for a longer
time than is ideal. Too much juice surrounding the meat is never a
good thing, nor is juice that’s cloudy.
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 41

Shoulder
The shoulder area yields two cuts, Boston butt (so-named not for
the hog’s hindquarters but for barrels the cut was stored and
shipped in back in ye olden times) and the picnic shoulder. Both
commonly are used for pulled pork, and they’re good for non-
barbecue applications like stewing.
Boston butt is the more tender of the two cuts. Picnic shoulder
cuts cost lest but contain more large fat deposits. Figure 3-1 gives
you a look at both cuts.
Ribs
Pork ribs are cut from either the top or bottom portion of the rib
cage. Baby back, or loin back, ribs come from the top section and
are small and pretty lean, which makes them faster to cook.
Spareribs come from the area closer to the belly, which makes them
a neighbor to the bacon area and, as you may expect, fattier than
baby back ribs. You see an example of both rib cuts in Figure 3-2.
Beef
You want any beef that you buy to have a rosy hue and abundant
marbling (see Figure 3-3). The exception is vacuum-packed beef,
which retains the purplish color that beef has before it’s exposed
to air. Pass over any beef that has a gray or brown tinge to it.
Figure 3-1: Boston butt comes from the upper shoulder of the pig; the picnic
shoulder comes from the joint area of the foreleg.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
42

Figure 3-2: The ribs yield two different cuts. Leaner baby back ribs come from
the top and spareribs from the bottom.
Figure 3-3: The meat on the left doesn’t have enough marbling to give good
flavor and texture; the cut on the right is perfect.
Meat should feel firm, and you want to buy cuts that aren’t swim-
ming in juices. Too much moisture often indicates that the meat
got warmer than it should have.
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 43

You can figure out whether meat has been previously frozen by
pressing your thumb onto its surface. If water pools into the inden-
tation, the meat has taken a turn in the freezer.
Ribs
Back ribs come from the same spot that yields rib roasts or rib-eye
steaks and have a goodly amount of fat. Basically scrap, the slabs
tend not to have a lot of meat on them. Look for the meatiest cuts
you can find. Ideally, you don’t see the bones of the ribs on the slab.
Beef short ribs are cut into individual ribs (English style) or as
cross-sections of rib meat with slices of bone dotting the cut
(flanken style). You’re more likely to use a rack of back ribs for bar-
becue cooking; the other cuts are ideal for braising (cooking slowly
in a small amount of liquid).
Figure 3-4 shows you all three styles of beef ribs.
Brisket
Brisket is cut from about the same area of the cow that picnic
shoulder comes from on a hog (see Figure 3-5). It’s made up of a
flat and a point (see Chapter 4). The point is thicker and holds a lot
more fat than the flat, which is heftier. A fat cap runs along the top
length of the brisket and is critical for keeping this otherwise
tough cut of meat moist while it cooks.
Look for brisket with even marbling, a nice, white fat cap and uni-
form thickness throughout.
Figure 3-4: You find beef ribs in three forms.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
44

Figure 3-5: Brisket comes from atop the foreleg of the cow.
Poultry
In most cases, you leave a chicken or turkey whole when you cook
it in the smoker. Butterflying the bird helps it cook faster and more
evenly. (For information on how to butterfly a chicken or turkey,
turn to Chapter 4.)
Chicken
Look for a fryer chicken that weighs in somewhere close to 3 1⁄2
pounds. The skin should be cream or slightly yellow in color, and
any juices that surround the chicken are likely to be pink and clear.
(Avoid chicken that has dark, foggy-looking juice or an excess of
juice.)
Turkey
Turkeys need some kind of brining (soaking in salt and liquid) to
stay juicy and flavorful. If you want to brine the bird yourself, go
for a natural turkey; if you prefer to go straight to the rub portion
of the program and then smoke the sucker, go ahead and buy a
self-basted bird.
Look for one weighing somewhere around 13 pounds. Buy one
much bigger than that, and the bird is likely to dry out from the
long cooking time you need to get the heat to its center.
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 45

Handling Meat without Hazard
So delicious, yet so very damaging to your intestines if not handled
properly: Meat and its juices are perfect settings for bacteria that
can put the hurt on you.
Raw meat is to bacteria like Barry White records and satin sheets
are to humans. Food doesn’t start out sterile (but high tempera-
tures kill off most of the bacteria that rode along on your food from
the farm to your kitchen), and protein in particular is a primo
locale for encouraging bacteria to multiply.
None of this means you should shy away from meat, but it does
mean that treating it with proper care is a must for the health of
you and your guests.
Bacteria is most likely the culprit when the nastiness of foodborne
illness (cramping, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) invades your home.
Handling food safely makes your chances of having to cope with
these flulike symptoms much slimmer.
Follow these guidelines to ensure that you’re not giving bacteria a
playground while you prepare your meal:
 Before you get started, wash in hot water all the utensils
and surfaces you intend to use. Bacteria may be hanging 
out on your cutting board before you even start.
 Avoid cross-contamination: Don’t let anything touch the raw
meat or its juices — or anything the meat and juices came
into contact with.
• Use one knife and cutting board to cut vegetables and
any other non-meat food, and use a separate knife 
and cutting board to prep your meat.
• Regard anything that the meat touches as out of com-
mission for the rest of your prep work. If you set raw
meat on a dish, that dish is exactly the wrong thing for
ferrying your cooked food back from the grill.
• Wear gloves when you work with meat, or wash your
hands thoroughly in hot water before you touch any-
thing else.
• Portion out the amount of rub you think you need before
you start. Throw out any leftovers from that portion.
You can keep your rub, but not if it has come into con-
tact with meat, and chances are good that the process of
applying it leads to contamination from your hands.

46

 Store meat at an appropriate temperature. Refrigeration
slows down bacteria, so keep meat at 40 degrees or lower
until shortly before you want to cook it. (In Chapter 4, I tell
you about the benefits of letting meat sit at room temperature
before cooking. That’s fine as long as you don’t go overboard.)
Throw out any meat that has been outside the fridge or freezer
for more than two hours.
 Throw out any leftover marinade. It may have been your
best batch ever, but if it came into contact with meat, it’s fit
only for the garbage disposal.
Stocking Dry Ingredients
In contrast to the bland look of herbs and spices as you so often
see them — in rows of identical jars in grocery stores — herbs and
spices have a long and colorful history of intrigue, one with power
struggles, transcendence, and poetry. Seasonings have inspired
dangerous travels, treated illnesses, fueled spiritual practices, and
defined and refined cultures. More to the point here, they’ve trans-
formed many a dinner from bland to enchanting.
The difference between herb and spice depends on where on a
plant the flavorful bit originates:
 Herbs are the leafy green bits of plants that grow upright and
aren’t woody.
 Spices include plants’ bark, seeds, roots, fruit, or flowers.
Cinnamon comes from bark, for example; cloves are dried
flower buds.
Must-haves for your spice cabinet
As you continue to cook, your stock of seasonings will grow. To get
going, you want a collection of adaptable flavors in your spice rack.
Here’s a list of the seasonings you can’t cook well without, the ones
that provide the basis for your barbecue cooking collection:
 Allspice
 Black pepper
 Cayenne pepper
 Chili powder
 Cinnamon
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 47

 Cloves
 Coriander
 Crushed red pepper
 Cumin
 Curry powder
 Dry mustard
 Garlic powder
 Ginger
 Salt
 Sweet paprika
 Sugar
Spices can be extremely spendy, particularly if you buy them a
little at a time. If you’re even moderately committed to cooking,
buy spices in bulk at discount stores. You end up paying about a
tenth of what you would by using those teeny jars that the super-
markets sell.
Storing spices, but not too long
Dried herbs and spices are pretty stable. You don’t need to baby
them, but a few tips go a long way toward keeping your seasonings
at their flavorful best:
 Avoid heat. Ideally, you want your spices to stay under 70
degrees, so storing them next to your stove or oven is not 
the best way to go.
 Keep dried herbs dry. Moisture leads to mold; avoid it by
storing your spices in airtight containers. If you keep your
seasonings in the fridge or freezer (which frankly isn’t the
best idea, given the humidity of those environments), make
sure you put them back right after you use them so condensa-
tion doesn’t get a chance to infiltrate your herb.
 Let there be no light. Light is hot, and it saps strength from
your spices. Keep your herbs in a cupboard, safely tucked
away from any light source.
 Date your containers. A safe bet is to throw away any spice
that has reached its first birthday in your cupboard. When
you buy a new container of this or that, mark the date on the
label and save yourself any confusion or unsatisfying concoc-
tions down the road.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
48

If you can’t smell it, you can’t taste it. Whenever you’re on the fence
about throwing away a spice, take a whiff. Unless you get a clear
waft of the aroma (and it’s the one you want it to be), you can’t
expect to get the taste you’re after from the seasoning. Toss it out.
The Stuff of Sauce
Given the importance of sauce in many barbecue enthusiasts’ eyes,
making your own may sound a little intimidating. Nuts to that.
Every great sauce follows a straightforward formula, and the differ-
ences among them come from the nuances — from basically the
same stuff you’d do to tweak prepared barbecue sauce you picked
up at the store.
In this section, I give you the basic ingredients for smart sauce-
making. Balance is the critical element of sauce, and you find it by
mixing sour, sweet, heat, and seasonings. In Chapter 11, you find
guidelines for mixing and matching these components for killer
sauces.
Even the most assiduous note-taking and recipe-following is unlikely
to produce the same results in a sauce over and over. Sauces are
greater than the sum of their parts and frankly feisty — their parts
are in a battle; meanwhile you’re working for balance. Getting a
grip on how various flavors work together helps keep your sauces
in line, and practice and experimentation make correcting to find
the balance you want second nature.
Smart bases
The first rule of the sauce-making is to match your sauce to the
stage of cooking during which you plan to use it: Add tomato-
based barbecue sauce too early in the cooking process, for exam-
ple, and you’ll burn it onto your meat. (Chapter 1 tells you about
how to use sauces at various stages.)
Every sauce starts with a base — a foundation ingredient that
makes up the largest part of your recipe and carries the rest of 
the flavors.
How you like your sauce has a great deal to do with where you
grew up. For many people, tomato-based sauce is the be-all and
end-all of barbecue, but Carolinians would tell you differently. For
them, sauce is thin and sour.
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 49

Bases for barbecue sauces typically are one of the following, in
order of most to least commonly used:
 Tomato: Sauce, paste, or ketchup — tomatoes provide a rich
base that lends itself to sweet or hot sauces, and anything in
between. Tomatoes are the most-used base for barbecue
sauces.
 Vinegar: Thin, vinegar-based sauces have a (not surprisingly)
strong, sour finish. Apple cider vinegar is the type most often
called for. You can use these acidic sauces at any stage of the
cooking process or as dips alongside your meat. 
 Mustard: A great complement to pork, mustard-based sauces
are thick and also can be used as marinade, mop, finishing
sauce, or dip.
 Mayonnaise: Mayo-based “white sauce” is a favorite in the
Alabama. Treat it like a tomato-based sauce and save it for 
the last few minutes of cooking.

The skinny on fresh herbs
Dried herbs fill the bill for most of your barbecue projects, but you may at 
some point want to experiment with the fresh version. Especially if you have a
garden — fresh herbs are much pricier than their dried and jarred counterparts.
The flavor in fresh herbs is not as concentrated, so you use more of fresh herbs than
you do dried. If you’re substituting fresh herbs in a recipe that calls for the dried ver-
sion, a ratio of 1 teaspoon dried to 1 tablespoon fresh is about right in most cases.
Fresh herbs have a much shorter shelf life than do the dried varieties — about a
week in the fridge. So if you find yourself swimming in fresh herbs and want to hang
onto them, try drying them yourself. Here’s how:
1. Cut only healthy stems from the plant. Pick off any browned leaves from the
stems.
2. Shake them to get rid of any dirt and bugs that may be clinging to the leaves. You
also can rinse them in cold water, but be sure to blot off all the water with a
paper towel.
3. Bundle several stems together, and tie the bundles with string near the cut end
of the stems.
4. Hang the bundles in a dark spot that provides plenty of air circulation and little
moisture.
5. Check back in five or six days. Complete drying may take a couple weeks.
When the leaves are crumbly, you know the herbs are ready. Crunch ’em up and
put ’em in an airtight container.

Finding balance
When working toward balance in your sauce, you need sweet,
savory, and sour elements, and you probably want a little some-
thing to give you heat. 
Within those broad guidelines are about a gazillion possibilities,
but keeping in mind those three elements when you’re cooking can
save your sauce from unpleasant imbalance. If something doesn’t
seem quite right, run through the elements and try to figure out
which one’s not pulling its weight.
No way can I give you a comprehensive list of bits that may
improve your sauce, but in order to give you a notion of what 
kinds of things fit into each category, here are several ingredients
that have been proven to do good things to a barbecue sauce:
 Sweet touches:
• Brown sugar
• Fruit juice
• Honey
• Molasses
• Soda (the Coke or Pepsi kind, not the fizzy water variety
and not diet, which turns bitter when it cooks)
• Sugar
 Something sour:
• Lemon juice
• Lime juice
• Mustard
• Vinegar
• Worcestershire sauce
 Savory additions:
• Beef stock
• Chicken stock
• Ketchup
• Soy sauce
• Tomato paste
• Tomato sauce
Chapter 3: Collecting Ingredients and Using Them Wisely 51

Using seasonings
If it exists as a plant, someone at some time has thrown it into a
sauce. Safe starts are anything that you’d use for a barbecue rub.
Check out Chapter 5 for recommendations and to find out about
flavor combinations that stand out — in good ways and in bad.
Season your sauces slowly. You can always add more, but taking
some back is impossible.

Barbecue Methods, 
Art, and Science
In This Chapter
 C’mon, baby, light my fire pit
 Readying meat for its moment
 Making the right temperature last
 Finishing strong when the smoking’s done
B
efore you can offer your friends brisket so savory that they
call upon the powers of interpretive dance to describe it, you
have to gear up (see Chapter 2) and plan several steps ahead.
In this chapter, I give you guidelines for figuring out how to get
where you want to go, from preparing the meat to taking that first
taste. I also show you how to baby your barbecue while it cooks
and how to finish it flavorfully without losing moisture.
Beginning with an End in Mind
If you’re more inclined to jump in the car and start driving instead
of planning a vacation, the type who might head down to the Little
White Wedding Chapel with the person you just locked eyes with
from across the paddy wagon, then barbecue may not be for you.
Barbecue requires forethought and patience — good barbecue,
that is. You can make all the bad barbecue you want without plan-
ning and while in a hurry. You can also cook a turkey in the
microwave, but no one’s going to want to eat it.
When you get the hang of cooking barbecue, much of what you
find in this section will be second nature. Your own adventures 
in trial and error will pay off and yield the secrets that make your

cooking unique. Until you cook with confidence, though, take
advantage of the hard work others have done.
Dedicate a notebook to your barbecue hits and misses. The glories
that come off your grill or out of your pit unfortunately stick in
your mind more as the mmms of your guests than as the details of
your efforts.
Planning hours (and hours) ahead
Despite the tales that need telling and the smack that needs talk-
ing, the real reason competitors show up for competitions a day
before the cooking begins is that they need hours and hours to
trim, marinate, smoke, and finish the meats they’re sending to the
judges.
The following sections give you some notion of how much time you
need to set aside.
Seasoning with dry rubs
More time means more flavor, but some meats soak in rubs much
more quickly than others and can become dry from the salt. To get
the most out of your dry rubs without going overboard, stay within
the following parameters:
 Allow about an hour and no more than an hour and a half for
chicken breasts.
 Dark-meat chicken, such as legs and thighs, have muscle
tissue that’s less dense than that of the white meat, so they
pick up flavors more easily. Forty-five minutes to an hour
ought to do the trick.
 If you’re cooking a whole chicken, 4 hours is a good start, and
you can let the meat sit in its rub for as many as 12 hours.
 Pork chops or steaks need an hour and can handle as much
as three hours.
 A rack of ribs does best with 12 hours.
 Briskets and pork shoulders require 12 hours and can handle
a full day of soaking in a rub.
Use rubber gloves to pat rubs onto the meat you’re cooking, and
get rid of the gloves before you do anything else. Raw meat juices
on your hands are the perfect route to contaminating your utensils
or any other food you’re cooking, adding up to a side of botulism
with your brisket.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
54

Using marinades
You find a wide range of possibilities with marinades, depending
on the type and size of meat you’re preparing and the ingredients
in your marinade. Use a marinade with hot chilies and the meat
needs to stay in contact with the marinade for a shorter time than
it would if the strongest flavor in your marinade is oregano.
Another important factor is the size of the meat you’re marinating:
 Small pieces of meat, like shrimp or boneless chicken
breasts, grab flavors in about an hour.
 Give steaks and chops at least three hours and as many as six
hours.
 Veggies do well with a couple hours’ marinating time.
 Whole chickens, pork loins, rack of lamb, or other big
pieces of meat need at least 5 hours and as many as 14 hours
in the marinade.
 If you’re marinating something as big as a pork shoulder or
brisket, allow about a day.
Marinating is an art that requires trial and error. Let your imagina-
tion run wild as you concoct your own marinades (Chapter 5 gives
you some starting points, and you find several recipes in Chapter 7),
but remember when you use them that strong flavors make their
presence known in a meat far faster than mild flavors do.
Selecting style and substance
The ’80s proved that too much sometimes is more than enough,
thank you. You’re likely to dig up that same nugget of wisdom if
you throw rub, marinade, and finishing sauce on a poor, defense-
less chicken breast.
Chicken, fresh fish, and seafood put up little resistance to the fla-
vors you add before you cook them. That’s great news if you want
to make something delicious in short order but bad news if you get
overzealous with seasonings and marinating times.
How you choose to season your meats is one more in a long line of
personal preference points that you encounter in the world of bar-
becue. You may well cook a rack of ribs that you marinate and rub
and baste and then serve with a healthy mop of sauce. Then again,
you may prefer your ribs to be simply rubbed and smoked.
Chapter 4: Barbecue Methods, Art, and Science 55

Whatever methods you’re using to get great flavor, you’re thwart-
ing yourself if you don’t take harmony into consideration. Your
best cinnamon-tinged rub just isn’t going to work with the horse-
radish in Alabama white sauce (see Chapter 9), no matter how
delightful each is on its own.
Here’s what you can expect from the various flavor-enhancing
methods:
 Dry rubs provide dashes of flavor when you simply sprinkle
them on and get cooking; they change the texture and charac-
ter of meat when you use them as marinades. Dry rubs ensure
that you get a nice crust on your smoked meats.
 Marinades tenderize meats because they have acids, like
lemon juice or vinegar. Lean meats do especially well in mari-
nades, which break down the muscle fibers and then keep the
meat moist.
 Finishing sauces contain sugar, which means if you apply
them before your meats are just about cooked, you get a
burnt crust. Save finishing sauces for the final step, when they
help keep meat moist. (I tell you more about finishing sauces
in the “Using final-stage sauces” section, later in this chapter.)
Trimming and Prepping Meat 
without, Er, Butchering It
Striking the balance between juicy flavor and tender chewing
starts with how you trim the meat you cook. The following sec-
tions give you guidelines for getting the most popular cuts ready
for your rub or marinade — or grill or smoker.
Any piece of meat can stand a quick rinse in the sink to wash off
odors or who-knows-what that the meat may have picked up in
your fridge or the butcher’s. Gently pat it dry after its light shower.
Priming pork butt
Pork butt actually comes from the shoulder of the animal and so
contains a number of muscles that meet up in the cut (see 
Figure 4-1). It’s a pretty solid hunk of meat, but one with a lot 
of fat veins that require a careful prep.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
56

Figure 4-1: A pork butt comes with a thick fat cap and a lot of internal fat, as
well.
When prepping a pork butt, take the following steps:
1. Trim the fat cap.
Start at one side and, with a large, sharp knife, begin trim-
ming the fat cap as evenly as possible about 1⁄8 inch all the
way across the top.
2. Cut off remaining pockets of fat.
You can make yourself crazy trying to scalpel through to
get off all the fat you see on a pork butt, and there’s just no
good reason to do so. Slice off the substantial portions you
find, and leave it at that.
3. Cut out any large veins or blood clots you run into.
Cleaning ribs
You don’t have to work too hard to prep ribs, and you can use the
process I outline here for beef or pork ribs.
Chapter 4: Barbecue Methods, Art, and Science 57

Whatever style ribs you’re making, you find a membrane along the
bone side of the rack. Use a table knife (some people find a screw-
driver works better) to puncture the membrane along one end of
the rack, and then use a paper towel to grip the thing and pull it
from the ribs (see Figure 4-2). Finally, if you see excess fat on the
ribs, trim it off.
Preparing beef brisket
Brisket is cut from the sternum area of the cow, and it includes the
following parts (see Figure 4-3):
 Flat: The lean meat that you slice and eat after you cook it
 Point or deck: A fattier section that overlays the majority of
the flat
 Fat cap: The thick section of fat that separates the flat and the
point
Figure 4-2: Pull the membrane from the bone side of the ribs before you season
and cook them.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
58

Figure 4-3: Parts of a brisket.
Most brisket starts out with a fairly thick layer of fat. Start whittling
that down by cutting off excess around the point. Then trim down
the fat along the flat by running a large, sharp knife along the fat,
leaving only about a quarter-inch layer. Rub your hand over the flat
so you get a feel for any deep pockets of fat, and then shave those
down.
Grooming poultry
A whole bird doesn’t require much in the way of preparation. Just
pull out the neck and giblets from the chicken’s or turkey’s cavity
and then slice off whatever fat surrounds the opening. You don’t
need to tie up the legs as you would if you cooked it in the oven.
After you prepare a chicken, you may want to butterfly it to cook it
more quickly and evenly. Here’s how to do it:
1. Set the chicken on the table so its back is facing up and
its neck points away from you.
2. Use kitchen shears to cut alongside the backbone from
end to end.
You cut through the ribs rather than the spine itself (see
Figure 4-4).
Chapter 4: Barbecue Methods, Art, and Science 59

Figure 4-4: Cut alongside a chicken’s spine to split and flatten it for quicker
cooking.
3. Repeat Step 2, cutting along the opposite side of the spine
to remove it completely.
4. Press down on the breastbone to flatten the chicken.
Getting Time and 
Temperature Right
Some people tell you the secret to great barbecue is in the sauce.
Great sauce helps, sure, but barbecue doesn’t fly unless you cook
it slowly, over low, indirect heat fueled by natural sources such as
hardwood and charcoal.
Keeping a careful watch on the temperature in your smoker is criti-
cal for pulling tender, evenly cooked meat out of it. When you do
the pulling is the difference between becoming Kansas City’s pride
and being told, “Next year, just bring the beer to the barbecue.”
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters

Determining cook time
Intuition and experience are enough for barbecue cooks with seri-
ous pit time under their belts, but target internal temperatures are
the best guides for making your early barbecue efforts successful.
Table 4-1 shows you the numbers you’re shooting for.
The times that get you to the target internal temperature depend
on the size and density of the meat that you’re cooking and the
cooking temperature (and its fluctuations).
Table 4-1
Target Temperatures
Meat
Target Internal Temperature
Beef brisket
185 to 195 degrees
Beef tenderloin
130 degrees for rare, 140 degrees for medium rare, 
150 degrees for medium, 160 degrees for well
Boston butt
165 to 180 degrees if you’re slicing it, 185 to 195 degrees 
for pulling
Pork shoulder
165 to 180 degrees if you’re slicing it, 185 to 195 degrees 
for pulling
Whole chicken
170 degrees in the thigh
Whole hog
185 to 195 degrees in the shoulder
Whole turkey
170 degrees in the thigh
Managing the smoker
The urge to peek into or otherwise mess with your smoker is a
strong one, but it’s an impulse that’s best beaten back. Use the
Force, distract yourself with an unsolvable conundrum like
whether free will exists if thought is dependent upon physical
processes — whatever works — but for the love of Christmas,
don’t mess with the smoker any more than you have to.
For every single, solitary second your smoker lid is open, you lose
5 degrees of heat. You need several minutes to make up that loss.
Keeping an even temperature is your prime directive when it
comes to slow smoking. Maintaining your target cooking tempera-
ture with as little volatility as possible is the most important thing
you can do to end up with superstar-quality meat.
Chapter 4: Barbecue Methods, Art, and Science 61

If you spend $10,000 on a barbecue pit, the thing should hold your
temperature well. Along the spectrum of smoker types and quali-
ties, you find varying degrees of temperature management. Unless
you’re already making money from your barbecue, I recommend
sticking with something a few steps above the low end. You have to
keep an eye on it, but you don’t have to hock your grandfather’s
watch for it. (Chapter 2 tells you about choosing a smoker.)
Remember the following tips about holding a temperature in your
smoker:
 Your target temperature for most meats is 225 degrees, and
you have only about 25 degrees’ leeway in either direction 
to stay in the comfort zone.
 If your smoker doesn’t have a built-in thermometer, stick a
candy thermometer through the vent to keep tabs on the
inside temperature.
 Charcoal dies out after about 45 minutes, and you need a half-
hour to get another batch ready. (You don’t want to use char-
coal that hasn’t started to ash over.)

Free ribs, and no charge for the lies
Come summer, any old barbecue fan can take advantage of the free-for-all that arises
at barbecue competitions. Because the competitors don’t get vending licenses for the
events, they can’t sell their extra ribs, and they usually have quite a pile of them: Smoking
a half-dozen racks is common, even though the judges evaluate only six ribs at most
sanctioned events. Competitors want to improve their chances for getting that perfect
pair of ribs.
In the moment of relief after their entries are turned in, many competitors hand out
samples to passersby. Take advantage of the pulled pork or chicken, but take any-
thing you hear from the source with a grain of salt.
Part of the fun of competing is blowing smoke and, even though you aren’t a com-
petitor at the moment, who’s to say you won’t be later? Tom Schneider, a contributor
to this book and an accomplished pit master in the Indianapolis area warns first-timers
not to be fooled by the friendly faces:
Barbecuers are some of the nicest, friendliest people around. They’ll help you if
you run out of ice or out of salt, but if you ever ask someone to give a piece of
advice on barbecuing, you usually get a smile and not much more than that. If you
do get more, chances are, that person is intentionally leading you down the path
of screwing up your food.

 To keep a steady supply of ready charcoal, light another batch
in a charcoal chimney (see Chapter 2) shortly after you move
a new batch into the smoker.
 Close down the upper dampers when you need to reduce 
the heat, and open them a bit when you want to raise the 
temperature.
 Seriously: Don’t open the lid unless you absolutely have to.
Otherwise, you’re making your temperature (and, therefore,
your meat) go wonky.
The Big Finish
Given the extensive amount of time you put into your barbecue,
you wouldn’t be the first person to melt into a puddle of glum 
if your food doesn’t come out like you envisioned. Avoid that 
outcome by playing the barbecue endgame with good sense and
patience.
You don’t sprint to the barbecue finish. You keep on babying your
meats until they’re safely on your grateful guests’ plates.
Using final-stage sauces
The sauce you coat your pulled pork in or slather on your ribs usu-
ally is not the sauce you use before or during cooking, and here’s
why: Any sauce that contains sugar or tomatoes is going to burn at
a very low temperature, adding an unpleasant flavor and imparting
a less-than-toothsome texture to your meats.
So what’s the story with those sweet, tomato-based sauces that,
for many people, are the essence of barbecue? Those are all well
and good, provided that you wait until the cooking is almost done
to use them.
Baste your meat or brush on a mop sauce during cooking, but save
the finishing sauce (meaning anything with sugar or tomatoes —
most bottled sauces) for the last 10 percent of cooking time.
Brushing it on at the end means it keeps the flavor you want
instead of morphing into something that tastes like you should
have used it to nourish your garden. Chapter 10 gives you recipes
for mop sauces.
Chapter 4: Barbecue Methods, Art, and Science 63

Resting the meat
Just because you’ve pulled it from the smoker doesn’t mean your
meat is ready to go. Whatever you’re cooking needs a moment to
ease away from its cooking temperature and absorb the juices that
otherwise would end up all over a plate instead of in the meat,
where you want them. Resting your cooked meat — letting it sit
away from the heat for a while — keeps it from drying out.
Proteins inside the meat change their shape in response to heat.
Whatever moisture they hold is squeezed out in the process and
ends up in the center of the meat, where temperatures are coolest.
Give the meat a chance to cool down after cooking, and the pro-
teins shift shape again, this time picking up moisture from the
center of the meat.
Slice into meat before giving it a chance to rest, and you lose almost
half the juices.
You invest way too much time in barbecue to let last-minute impa-
tience ruin your work. Give your meats a good rest after cooking,
and your efforts are better showcased. Count on about two min-
utes for each pound of meat that you cooked.
Part I: Centuries of Barbecue Smarts in Four Chapters 
64
Keeping basting brushes clean
A challenge on par with creating the perfect sauce is cleaning the basting brush you
use to apply it.
Oil clings to the bristles and doesn’t rinse out no matter how determinedly you may
attack the brush-cleaning process. Bristles stay sticky and may even stink up your
utensil drawer.
Try putting your washed brushes in a glass, bristle-side-down, and pouring coarse
salt in around them until salt covers the bristles. Just as it does with meat, salt pulls
out moisture from the brushes so they’re dry and ready to go when next you need
them. Just shake off the salt.

Some people tell you to tent your meat with aluminum foil while it
rests. Others say that’s just playing with it. The idea is that the foil
keeps the heat in and keeps the meat from cooling off too fast.
Maybe so, but the difference isn’t striking. Foil or don’t — this 
decision isn’t going to make or break your results. But, of course,
there’s an exception. . . .
When you cook brisket or pork shoulder, you may want to wrap
the meat tightly in foil and towels and let it sit in an insulated bag
or cooler for an hour or so. Doing so takes advantage of carryover
cooking (the high temperature that meat maintains even after it’s
away from the heat source), and it may help tenderize it. Depends
on who you ask.
Pulling, slicing, presenting
After your meat is rested (I beg you: Check out the “Resting the
meat” section if you don’t know what I mean), you may well be fin-
ished. You 
can simply toss ribs or chicken pieces on a plate. Other cuts
require a smidge more work.
For pulled meats or brisket, find your knives or rubber gloves and
take the following steps for getting your meat ready to serve:
 When pork shoulder for pulled pork is cool enough you can
touch it, remove any fat still on the meat, and then dig in with
your hands, removing bones and shredding the meat into thin
strips. If hands-on preparation isn’t your thing, use a knife and
chop the meat into fine bits.
 The grain on beef brisket runs in two directions, so separate
the cuts before you slice the meat. Carve on the bias across
the grain into thin slices no thicker than a pencil. Figure 4-5
shows you how to slice brisket — an extra-critical point given
the texture of brisket.
 For pulled chicken, dig into the cooled bird with hands or
forks, tearing the meat from the bones. Of course, you can
also serve the whole pieces.

W
hat you do before you cook meat makes all the difference in
the result you get. No pressure, but really, taking the time
to let meat sit in a dry rub or marinade gives the stuff flavor and
can even bring any meat extra juiciness and more toothsome 
texture.
Dry rubs and marinades overlap in function but operate very dif-
ferently. In most cases, you use one or the other. This chapter
gives you the goods on what dry rubs and marinades do and how
they do it. You also find an overview of what goes into dry rubs
and marinades. They have many, many permutations, but the basic
formula for either is significantly easier than pie.
Building a Dry Rub 
from the Binder Up
A dry rub creates a bark on the outside of whatever meat you’re
cooking, and that bark holds in the moisture. Put it together well,
and the rub that builds the bark also provides some incredible
flavor in the meat.

You find as many recipes for rub as there are cooks, and there’s no
end to the possibilities. There is, however, a basic formula for
building a rub. (And, really, a limited number of standard combina-
tions that survive because they work so well together. The differ-
ence in these lies in the proportions of ingredients, and playing
with proportions could keep a cook busy ad infinitum.) The follow-
ing breakdown describes how most dry rubs come together:
 Binder: Something relatively neutral that provides a base for
all the other flavors. Paprika is a commonly used binder for
traditional barbecue dry rubs; cumin shows up in a lot of
Indian rubs; and if you’re following a Jamaican recipe, brown
sugar is likely to fill this role. (But brown sugar is not really
dry, and because it’s not powdery, it tends to sit on the meat
instead of penetrating it to add flavor.)
 Salt: Plain old table salt, sea salt, or kosher — garlic, even —
you want some kind of salt in the mix for flavor, texture, and
its tenderizing effect. A little salt draws out other flavors in
your rub — but use too much, and all you taste is salt.
 Sweet: Sugar adds body and helps balance your dry rub. Plain
old granulated sugar does the trick, and you get good results
from cane sugar or brown sugar as well. Use sugar sparingly,
though; too much will give your meat a burnt and bitter crust.
Turn to Chapter 8 to find out more about sugar’s problem
properties.
 Power: You generally add one or two strong flavors to give
your rub oomph: spices like chili powder, curry powder,
cayenne pepper, or crushed dried chilies work beautifully.
The four elements in the preceding list get you started, and then
you add some of this, a little of that, until you find the flavor you’re
looking for. Grab some dry mustard; toss in granulated onion —
whatever sounds tasty, within reason. In the upcoming section,
“Warring Flavors You Don’t Want to Mix,” I steer you away from
some bad ideas regarding spice mixing.
When you start putting together a rub, determine the main flavor
you want to come through, and then make sure you give that flavor
top billing. Use equal amounts of sugar and salt, for example, and
you end up tasting neither. But if you want a sweet rub and use
more sugar than salt, you get sweetness with salt flavor that keeps
the rub in balance.
Part II: Preparation Prevails: Using Rubs and Marinades 
70

Rubs work best when they’re composed of fine powders that give
you an even coat on the meat. And fresh-ground herbs release
more flavor than those that have been ground months before. A
coffee grinder works great for reducing coarse salt, coriander
seeds, or pretty much anything else to a powder. If you already
have a grinder that you use for your morning coffee, get a second
one just for grinding seasonings; otherwise, you’re likely to end up
with some funky-tasting coffee.
And speaking of coffee — many cooks use it in their rubs. Ground
coffee (but not used coffee grounds) gives a unique flavor to meat
and is a good complement to smoking. Legend has it, the notion of
using coffee grounds came as an accident when a cook spilled
some coffee on the cutting board where his waiting steaks sat and
decided to roll with it, rolling his steaks in the stuff to tasty effect.
After you mix any dry rub, seal it in an airtight container and store
it at room temperature for about a day. You can skip this step if
you’re in a hurry, but a nice amalgamating effect comes from let-
ting the spices mingle, making the whole much bigger than the sum
of its parts.
Chapter 5: Mixing and Matching in Rubs and Marinades 71
Smelling the flavor
“Eye appeal is half the meal” is a mantra that reverberates through restaurants,
where presentation is critical. At competitions, barbecue cooks go to great lengths
to make sure their food looks lovely, even spraying it with apple juice to give it an
eye-catching sheen. Turns out, the nose has much more to do with your perception
of taste than your eyes.
The tongue picks up on only five different flavors (sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and
salty), but the nose can discern among thousands of aromas. Molecules from herbs
and spices are highly volatile and so fly up into the air and into your nose, bringing
the aroma of the seasoning with them. Even as you’re chewing, the aroma-
containing molecules are meandering into your nasal cavity. The sensation of
smelling mingles with that of tasting, and the whole glorious combination comes
together as pleasure (or not).
You get a first-hand, um, taste of this phenomenon when you have a cold and can’t
get a good whiff of your food. Those clogged sinuses of yours are the reason you
can’t taste the difference between an apple and a raw potato.

Seasonings That Play Well
Together
The grains filling little jars in your spice rack started out as
weapons. Plants’ intense flavors are how they convince animals to
get away after taking a bite. Dilution and mixing make the flavors
palatable to people, but strike upon the wrong formula of flavors,
and your cooking may become noxious in a new way. That doesn’t
mean you shouldn’t experiment, but it does mean that smart
experimentation follows a few rules.
As you flip through the recipes in Chapter 6, you probably start to
notice a few similarities among them. That’s because there’s a
basic formula for making rubs, and some general guidelines for
using seasonings that are never going to change. Don’t think for a
minute that those truths are limiting factors, though: Within them
are at least a gazillion ways to get from spice rack to dry rub. And,
as you get a feel for mixing dry rubs, you’re likely to want to try
your own. This section gives you the basics you need for doing it
yourself.
You have centuries of cooking with herbs and spices to draw on,
which means a lot of the trial and error of spice pairing has been
done for you. Still, no hard and fast rules exist when it comes to
putting seasonings together, and your personal palate has a lot to
do with the combinations you favor.
Put every color in a paint box together, and muddy brown is the
likely result. Go overboard when putting spices together, and fla-
vors start canceling each other out, leaving you with a tasteless
sludge. Keeping your combos simple usually gives you the best-
tasting rub.
The following guidelines help you experiment with seasonings
without arriving at less-than-toothsome results:
 Open the lids of the seasonings you plan to use, and set the
containers out in a close configuration on the counter. Take a
whiff of the melded flavors and see whether anything sticks
out as not meshing. Forget that seasoning this time.
 Use different quantities of spices that have similar qualities.
That is, if you’re using two sweet spices, like allspice and
anise, use a little more of one than the other.
Part II: Preparation Prevails: Using Rubs and Marinades 
72

 Keep in mind that more is almost never better. Using a few
well-matched seasonings usually is preferable to adding and
adding and adding flavors.
 Shoot for contrast: If you’re using a hot spice like cayenne
pepper, tone it down with a little sugar.
 Remember that the benefit of using some moderately flavored
seasonings is that they bind more intense flavors without
muddying up the mix. Good choices for this effect are corian-
der, fennel, paprika, and turmeric.
Table 5-1 shows you time-tested combinations of herbs and spices
used for various types of cuisines. Getting a sense of how flavors
work together goes a long way toward success as you start experi-
menting in the kitchen.

Mixing Marinades
Part tenderizer, part juicifier, and part sweet sassy molassey!, mari-
nades give meat greater toothsomeness in every sense of the word.
A marinade is any combination of oil, acid, and herbs that meat
soaks in before you cook it. You have an infinite variety of combi-
nations for creating delectable marinades, and with the slightest
smarts about how the elements work together, you can whip up
versions for any meat you want to cook and any result you want to
chow down on.
In this section, you find out how to put together balanced mari-
nades that tenderize, give great pep, and add moisture to whatever
meats you may cook. You accomplish that tripartite mission with
three kinds of ingredients that vary according to the effect you
want to achieve and the kind of meat you’re cooking.
Acid
Acids act on proteins in meat, helping them break down and
become more tender. As the proteins break down, they leave space
within the meat for flavor and moisture to seep in. Acids that com-
monly are used in marinades include the following:
 Beer
 Bourbon or other hard liquors
 Buttermilk
 Carbonated beverages (except diet soda, which adds an
unpleasant bitter flavor)
 Coffee
 Cranberry juice
 Grapefruit juice
 Lemon juice
 Lime juice
 Orange juice
 Vinegar
 Wine
 Yogurt
Part II: Preparation Prevails: Using Rubs and Marinades 
74

Which works best? Surprisingly, it’s the buttermilk and yogurt,
which seem to be able to better penetrate meat but without leav-
ing it too tough or mushy-textured. The theory goes that dairy
products work best, in part, because they’re on the low side of the
acid spectrum.
Oil
A marinade’s oil is its moisture. A good dose of oil — just about
any kind will do — helps meat hang onto whatever moisture it has
and even adds to it.
Seasonings
You add flavor with the oil and acid, but you get most of your mari-
nade’s pow when you use seasonings to build a balanced and inter-
esting combination of flavors. (The earlier section, “Seasonings
That Play Well Together,” tells you more about how to combine
seasonings.)
Chapter 5: Mixing and Matching in Rubs and Marinades 75
Ceviche: The crossroads 
of marinating and cooking
Travel to South America or Central America, and you probably sample a cold
seafood salad called ceviche. To make it, bite-size pieces of fish are soaked in lime
juice or lemon juice, minced onions and peppers, and maybe cilantro or parsley.
Sometimes other minced ingredients, like celery, avocado, or tomato, are added as
well. All kinds of fish end up in ceviche, and what kind you find depends in part on
where you are.
The acid in the lemon juice or lime juice “cooks” the fish over the course of a couple
hours by changing the composition of its proteins, just as heat does, but more gently.
Preparing fish this way is gentler than heating it, so the result is more delicately fla-
vored, more succulent fish.
Just like barbecue, the word ceviche (and the stuff itself) has origins that spark
debate. One theory that seems reasonable enough has it stemming from the Iberian
Spanish word escabeche (meaning “marinade”).

Matching Marinade to Meat
Many of the same ingredients work no matter what meat you plan
to cook: Garlic, black pepper, citrus juice, and ginger are practi-
cally ubiquitous marinade ingredients that complement just about
anything you could think to cook. Other ingredients work better
with particular types of meats.
In this section, I give you some ideas about what works with some
of the common meats for outdoor cooking.
Starters for seafood
Because seafood soaks up flavor so quickly, marinades work best
when they’re subtle, and the type of fish you plan to cook affects
the flavors that you use: The stronger flavors that may work for
denser, fattier fish like tuna or salmon don’t necessarily comple-
ment delicate red snapper. And then there’s shellfish. Shrimp are
great for grilling and can hang with most marinades; scallops need
a sure hand for appropriate marinating.
How does all this add up? Here are a few guidelines for marinating
fish:
 Marinate with reserve. Too much time or intensity enables a
marinade to overpower a fish or even cook it (which is tasty,
sure, but a whole different animal from marinated, grilled
fish).
 Match subtler flavors to more delicate fish. The fat content
gives you an indication of the fish’s muscle in the face of mari-
nade. Fattier fish can withstand stronger flavors than lower-fat
fish. If you’re cooking tuna or mackerel, for example, you can
let loose with some soy sauce, crushed red pepper, wasabi
powder, or similarly strong ingredients.
 Use the tried and true. Citrus juices and olive oil are always a
safe start for fish; black or white pepper, paprika, or a smidge
of crushed red pepper can finish the job with surprisingly
delicious results that belie the simplicity of the concoction.
Adding oomph to chicken
Chicken is practically a blank canvas and does fine with whatever
you choose to paint on it, be that a subtle lemon-herb marinade or
an intense chile-ginger version. It’s hard to go wrong in part
Part II: Preparation Prevails: Using Rubs and Marinades 
76

because chicken itself is mildly flavored and its texture makes it
somewhat resistant to the seasonings you add (except for the dark
meat, which is less dense and picks up flavor more efficiently).
Citrus juices, wine, mustard, and soy sauce top a long list of good
pairings for chicken.
Because chicken can be resistant to marinade, reserve some of
yours (a portion that hasn’t touched the raw chicken, of course) to
serve with your cooked chicken. You can also boil the marinade (in
which case, you can even use leftovers from the marinade bowl)
for several minutes to reduce it and create an extra-flavorful sauce
for topping or dipping the chicken. An extra dash of the flavors you
cooked the chicken in goes a long way toward driving home the
result you want.
Good ideas for pork
Pork has a mild flavor that you can easily take in several directions
with marinade, and it gives itself over well to the marinade, readily
absorbing the flavors. Soy sauce is a stellar starter for pork and
shows up in the majority of pork marinade recipes; use it with
ginger, garlic, and honey or sugar, and you get a tender, tasty
result. Go in the other direction and pair it with fruit juices for a
sweeter and milder result.
Pork also does well with delicate, wine-based marinades, and it 
can stand up to powerful marinades with chile sauce or chipotle
peppers.
Do your worst; pork can probably take it.
Sure bets for beef
The rich flavor of beef merits complex flavors in a marinade. Red
wine or red wine vinegar are excellent choices, and soy sauce
works well, too. Horseradish is a sure bet, and so are
Worcestershire sauce, garlic, dry mustard, and ginger.
Herb-wise, thyme or rosemary are great choices; a bay leaf can add
the smidge of bitterness that balances meat’s savoriness.
Use only a little citrus, if you use it at all. A hint of it can make your
other flavors pop, but if the citrus takes over, it clashes with the
beef.
Chapter 5: Mixing and Matching in Rubs and Marinades 77

Timing Meat’s Marinade Soak
The reason different types of meat have different flavors (the struc-
ture of their proteins) is the same reason meats handle marinades
differently. Leave fish too long in marinade, and you cook it. Denser
red meat can take much more time to soak in the flavors of a mari-
nade, but it turns mushy on its edges and tough in the middle if it
spends more than the optimal amount of time soaking.
Use a glass or stainless steel container to marinate meats, or put
the meat and the marinade in a plastic freezer bag with a zipper
seal. When you use aluminum bowls, the meat picks up unsavory
flavors and takes on an unnatural color because the acids in the
marinade oxidize molecules in the bowl.
The line between flavorful and over-marinated isn’t a thin one. You
usually have an unintimidating and wide margin of error to work
with. Here are some guidelines for determining the time particular
meats need in marinades:
 Fish: Up to an hour
 Chicken: One to three hours
 Pork: Four to seven hours
 Lamb: Five to eight hours
 Beef: Big barbecue cuts (like brisket), 12 to 24 hours; smaller
cuts that you grill, 6 to 12 hours
The timing depends somewhat on the flavors in the marinade, as
well. If you’re using a subtle marinade, go for the longer side of the
timing window; for intense marinades, err on the side of caution.
If you’re marinating meat for more than an hour, do so in the
fridge. You don’t want to risk giving bacteria a place to grow. Those
opportunistic suckers are lurking and ready to multiply like crazy.
Make sure you throw out any leftover marinade for that very
reason. Juices from the raw meat that soaked in it are an easy
target for a bacteria infestation.

Crafting Dry Rubs for 
Any Meat or Taste
In This Chapter
 Finding winning combinations of seasonings
 Whipping up rubs for any meat
 Sampling spicy, savory, and sweet rubs
A
little sweet, some salt, and some
heat, if that’s what you’re into — just
about any combination of flavors can go
into a tasty barbecue rub.
Some seasonings are barbecue staples.
(Watch for garlic and onion powders,
paprika, and cayenne in several of the
recipes to come.) and others break the tra-
ditional mold. Some cooks throw in practi-
cally the whole spice cabinet, and others
keep things simple with just a handful of
ingredients and get results just as good.
Using a dry rub is exceptionally easy. Just
sprinkle your mix onto the meat you plan
to cook and then pat it or rub it lightly into
the surface so that it really sticks.
After you introduce rub to meat, wrap the meat in plastic and let it
sit in the fridge for a while so the rub gets a chance to do its work.
You can get away with skipping this step and going right to the
cooking part of the program. Because the rub actually sits right on
the meat, you’re not going to lose flavor as you would if you were
to pull a meat from marinade before its time.
If you’re concerned about fat in your diet, you may be pleased to
know that, unlike marinades, dry rubs add flavor without using oil

salt, so they don’t exactly qualify as health food.
You can store a dry rub for about six months if you keep it in an
airtight container and away from light.

for Classic Dry Rubs
Salt and sugar are almost givens for a rub (although the upcoming

includes a no-salt version); what you do otherwise is up to you.
Still, certain flavors have been working their way into dry rubs for
decades, and in this section you find recipes that draw from barbe-
cue tradition.

Smokey Joel’s Competition 
BBQ Rub
Smokey Joel (also known as Joel Schwabe) fares well with this rub in 
competitions.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1 cup
1⁄4 cup brown sugar
⁄4 cup paprika
1⁄4 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
11⁄2 teaspoons dried oregano
11⁄2 teaspoons cumin
11⁄2 teaspoons celery salt
1 tablespoon dried, grated lemon or
orange peel (optional)
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.

Chapter 6: Crafting Dry Rubs for Any Meat or Taste 81
Smoke Hunters’ BBQ Rub
The Smoke Hunters team advises using this rub, which is the one they took
to their early competitions, on pork ribs, pork shoulder, or chicken. The
recipe, as written, produces about 2 cups of rub, which may be overkill if
you don’t use it regularly. Cut the recipe in half, and you still have enough
for a good 15 pounds of meat.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups
1⁄2 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup Sugar In The Raw
1⁄2 cup paprika
6 tablespoons fresh ground black pepper
6 tablespoons kosher salt
1 1⁄2 tablespoons granulated garlic
1 1⁄2 tablespoons granulated onion
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Sugar In The Raw is the brand name of turbinado sugar, which isn’t
refined as white sugar is and so still has some of the flavor and
nutrients from the sugar cane juice. It has a natural brown color
and larger crystals than refined white sugar, but you can use it in
much the same way when it comes to sweetening coffee or cereal.
Turbinado has more moisture than white sugar. In flavor and tex-
ture, it’s somewhere in the middle of brown and white sugars. It’s
more likely to replace brown sugar in recipes than white because
of its moisture content, and it also will harden as brown sugar does
if it’s not stored in an airtight container.

Pirate Potion #4
This recipe comes from the Pirates of the Grill, who warn that it’s a spicy one
but has a lot of depth. Fred Larsen from the team says the rub was developed
to use on pork but that it’s a swell seasoning for your morning eggs, too.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 3 cups
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup salt
1⁄2 cup paprika
1⁄4 cup chili powder
1⁄8 cup black pepper
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon chipotle pepper
1 tablespoon white pepper
1 teaspoon jalapeño pepper 
1⁄4 cup garlic powder
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Vary It! Try using seasoned salt rather than plain table salt.
Paradise Jerk Rub
The Pig Smokers in Paradise BBQ Team earns kudos when it uses this jerk
rub on pork: “It goes well with about any type of pork cut,” says member
Connie Owens.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1 cup
6 tablespoons onion powder
6 tablespoons onion flakes
2 tablespoons ground allspice
2 tablespoons black pepper
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
4 1⁄2 teaspoons dried thyme
4 1⁄2 teaspoons cinnamon
11⁄2 teaspoons nutmeg
11⁄2 teaspoons ground cloves
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.

Chapter 6: Crafting Dry Rubs for Any Meat or Taste 83
Spicy Rub #1 for Beef
John Webb, from the Up-in-Smoke team, said he started making spicy rubs
because he had a sinus infection that interfered with his taste buds. “I
started adding more and more spice until I could taste something,” he said.
“The downside was that everyone else was tasting the meat and saying,
‘Wow — that is way too spicy, but pretty good.’ I learned from that experi-
ence and cut down on the spices until I got the right blend. They still say,
‘Wow,’ but now they follow that with, ‘Boy, that’s good.’”
Webb makes his rub in big batches, using whole 3-ounce bottles, but he
says that the point is that you use equal parts of each ingredient (except
the cayenne powder or black pepper).
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 4 cups
3 ounces paprika
3 ounces cumin
3 ounces Cajun spice
3 ounces garlic powder
3 ounces garlic flakes
3 ounces onion flakes
3 ounces natural cane sugar
1 tablespoon cayenne powder or black
pepper
1 Combine all ingredients in a food processor.
2 Grind the mixture about 10 seconds.
Variation: To use this rub with chicken or pork, add 1 tablespoon mustard
powder.
You can add further dimension to any dry rub by adding just
enough liquid to turn it into a paste or wet rub. Any flavorful liquid
will do the trick, but some of the favorites are
 Apple juice
 Beer
 Mustard
 Olive oil
 Orange juice
 Worcestershire sauce
 Yogurt

Shigs-in-Pit Bootheel Butt Rub
Todd Grantham of the Shigs-in-Pit BBQ team said the name of this rub (and
the team’s sauce in Chapter 9) came from the area two of his team members
hail from — the Bootheel area of southeast Missouri. He says that rubs of
this style are popular in restaurants in that area.
Grantham advises using the rub on all things pork, especially ribs and pork
butt. The heavy yield of this recipe means that you may want to cut it in
half. Doing so still yields enough rub for two healthy-sized meals.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups

Chapter 6: Crafting Dry Rubs for Any Meat or Taste 85
A pinch of salt facts
No barbecue rub is complete without salt, and neither is any diet. Not only does salt
intensify aromas and flavors in the food that you use it on but it fills a physical need
in the human body. Among other things, sodium keeps nerve impulses flowing and
chloride helps keep your digestive system in top form. (Of course, the amount of salt
most people eat far surpasses the single gram per day that is necessary to get the
balancing job done.)
Salt comes from oceans and either is dried directly from the water and dubbed sea
salt or mined from seas that dried up and left behind massive salty deposits.
Strangely enough, this essential substance has achieved chichi status in the past
few years, and gourmet salt stores selling expensive, rare variations have popped
up, as have salt-tasting parties (not events for the high of blood pressure).
Different salts do bring slightly different flavors, and you also can find flavored salts,
like the hickory smoke salt that the Shigs-in-Pit Bootheel Rub recipe calls for. No
reason not to use a flavored salt in your rub, and doing so can be a shortcut or a
way to add flavor that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to bring to the rub.
Because it’s fine-textured, table salt is a good choice for dry rubs because you don’t
have to grind it to get it to stick fast to the meat surface. Most seasoned salts also
are fine-textured, but they come with a caveat: You lose a degree of control when
you use already-combined seasonings. You can be certain of getting exactly the
ratio of flavors that you want when you work from scratch.
Everything Rub
Rich Allen of Dick’s Bodacious Bar-B-Q, Inc., offers up this recipe that he says
can easily strike up a beautiful relationship with any meat you want to cook.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1⁄3 cup
1⁄4 cup seasoning salt
1 tablespoon coarse ground black pepper
1 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon mild chili powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder

Super Simple Brisket Rub
Doug Spiller of Smoked Signals BBQ keeps things nice and simple with this
rub of just four ingredients used in equal parts.
Spiller advises using a can of beer to mop your brisket when you use this
rub so that you can keep the flavors moving around on the meat.
In the last half-hour of cooking, Spiller uses three parts Sweet Baby Ray’s
sauce cut with one part beer to finish the brisket. He says that the sauce is a
perfect way to not only cut through some of the heat of the rub but also to
give the brisket a nice glaze.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 1 cup
1⁄4 cup black pepper
1⁄4 cup salt
1⁄4 cup paprika
1⁄4 cup onion powder
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Rib Dust
Rich Allen is a Texan who brought his barbecue to the Midwest when he
founded Dick’s Bodacious Bar-B-Q, Inc., a string of Indiana restaurants. His
rib rub is a well-balanced affair that makes good use of just a few flavors.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups
3⁄4 cup paprika
1⁄2 cup chili powder
1⁄4 cup cumin
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1⁄4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon thyme
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 tablespoon salt
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Tip: Press into meat at least half an hour before you plan to cook it.

Pork Perfection
The Smoked Signals BBQ team took home a first-place trophy with this rub,
which team leader Doug Spiller said he came up with after much studying of
recipes in books.
The rub includes a pretty heavy amount of sugar, and Spiller explains that
that’s what gives the pork a nice bark.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1 cup
1⁄4 cup granulated sugar
1⁄4 cup course cane sugar (turbinado)
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1⁄4 cup kosher salt
1⁄4 cup paprika
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
2 teaspoons white pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder
1 Combine all ingredients in a food processor.
2 Grind the mixture about 10 seconds.
You want a bark on your barbecued meats not only for the flavors
of the seasonings within it but also to hold in the moisture of the
meat. Rubs that include a lot of sugar tend to form a heartier bark,
but they fare poorly under high heat.
If you’re reaching into a bowl to sprinkle rub onto meat, make sure
that you don’t touch the meat and then put your hand into the rub.
Doing so contaminates the rub with the meat juices and invites
bacteria. Keep your rub clean, and it’ll last several months.

Yard Bird Rub
Rich Allen of Dick’s Bodacious Bar-B-Q, Inc., also served as the technical
reviewer for this book. Here, he offers a straightforward rub concocted just
for chicken and turkey.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1⁄4 cup rub
3 tablespoons poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coarse ground black pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon thyme
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Tip: Press into meat at least half an hour before you plan to cook it.
1⁄2 cup dark brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons sea salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon dried and ground thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon habenero or scotch bonnet
pepper powder
1⁄2 teaspoon allspice
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon dried and ground ginger
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Note: Make sure you wash your hands after handling the habenero powder.
Rubbing your eyes or other delicate regions with the stuff provides a burn you
don’t want to feel.
Jamaican Rib Rub
Poppi-Q BBQ founder Tom Schneider likes this spicy rub when it’s paired
with a citrus-based barbecue sauce. This recipe covers four slabs of pork
baby back or spare ribs.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 3⁄4 cup

Bucking Tradition with Rubs 
Exotic and Inventive
Pit masters aren’t the only cooks to use combinations of season-
ings to improve the flavor and texture of meat. In this section, you
find rubs that come from other cultures, as well as rubs that devi-
ate from the barbecue tradition.

Sweet Persian Rub
The Persian Empire influenced a large part of the culinary flavors through-
out Asia. This recipe from Brandon Hamilton pays tribute to those wonder-
ful flavors. It goes well with seafood, chicken, lamb, and beef.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None, but let sit at least 2 hours or overnight
Yield: About 3⁄4 cup
1 tablespoon black mustard seeds
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons turmeric
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons cayenne
2 tablespoon sesame seeds
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 tablespoon curry powder
2 teaspoons ground ginger
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Curry powder, which you use for Brandon Hamilton’s Sweet Persian
Rub, is a catchall term for spice mixes that mimic the combination
of seasonings used in Indian curry sauces. They’re made up of a
host of other roasted and powdered seasonings that varies accord-
ing to who made the mix. Curry powder usually contains at least a
dozen seasonings, which contribute to its complex flavor.
Curry powders are usually available in the grocery store, but you
may find a better selection if you turn to a specialty market or to
the Internet. The Spice House (www.thespicehouse.com) is a
good source with several varieties for sale.

Zesty No-Salt Herbal BBQ Rub
Paul Kirk offers a unique, salt-free rub that gets a spicy punch from a goodly
dose of chili powder.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups
1 cup cane sugar
1⁄2 cup light brown sugar
1⁄4 cup chili powder
3 tablespoons fine ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon dill weed
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon granulated onion
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon marjoram
1 teaspoon dried mustard
1 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon crushed rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Grilled Leg of Lamb Seasoning
Paul Kirk says his recipe for leg-of-lamb seasoning covers up to 5 pounds of
trimmed and butterflied lamb.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 3⁄4 cup seasoning
1⁄4 cup coarse ground black pepper
3 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons dried flaked garlic
1 tablespoon crushed rosemary leaves
1⁄2 cup balsamic vinegar
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Note: Store in refrigerator in airtight container or apply directly to lamb, using
a pastry brush to paint it onto the meat.

Lemon Rub a Dub Dub
Team N2Que calls its Lemon Rub a Dub Dub mix a great match for fish and
chicken.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 tablespoons
4 teaspoons lemon pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons oregano
2 teaspoons thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.
Fish is a lot more delicate than pork, chicken, or pretty much any-
thing else you may cook. When you apply rub to fish, you’re better
off just sprinkling it over the top instead of patting it on or rubbing
it into the flesh. And because fish so easily picks up flavors, you
use less of the rub than you do when you’re putting it on meats.
If you’re using a rub on chicken, make sure to pull back the skin
and sprinkle the rub directly onto the meat.

In This Chapter
 Finding time-tested ways to add flavor
 Concocting toothsome mixtures for your 
barbecue
 Bringing extra oomph to whatever you cook
A
little acidity, some seasonings,
maybe some chiles, and some time
turn your meals into something entirely
different, taking meat up several levels in
flavor and juiciness.
You don’t need too much time to get the
great results that marinades give, just a
little planning so you can ensure that you
give meat plenty of time to soak up the
flavor before you cook it. Cut that short,
and you lose the effect.
In this chapter, you find marinades of all
kinds and for most meats from barbecue
cooks who’ve tested variation after variation before hitting on their
masterpieces. They’ve done the work so all you have to do is some
mixing and refrigerating and collecting of compliments.

Priming Pork or Poultry
Dark or white and other white, chicken and pork don’t offer a lot in
the way of strong flavor on their own, but they both take to flavors
you add like a teenage girl to sarcasm. You don’t have much to
worry about when it comes to marinade flavors clashing with 
the mild meat, so chicken and pork make good media for 
experimentation.
Chapter 5 gives you points to consider when mixing up your own
marinades from scratch.
Cooking whole chickens or turkeys often presents a problem
because the two kinds of meat (white and dark) have very different
makeups, the dark legs being more rife with connective tissue that
can make meat chewy. Using a brine or marinade to weaken that
connective tissue helps you get a more even texture across the two
types of meat. But your best bet is to cut the chicken apart so that
you can cook the legs and breast separately.
Plumping a bird or chop with brine
When you use a brine, the meat you cook stays plumper than un-
brined meat does. That’s because brine makes use of salt to wreak
tasty havoc on the muscle fibers of meat. One element of that
result is opening up the muscle fibers to the liquid in the brine;
another is preventing the muscle fibers from reconnecting when
cooking is done. Both components make for juicier, more tender
meat.
Brines typically get about 5 percent of their total weight from salt.
Many brine recipes, including Charlie’s, account for what would
otherwise be overwhelming saltiness in the finished product by
adding sugar. Experiment with honey, molasses, or brown sugar to
impart further flavor while you combat the salt.
Rinse off any brine you use before you cook the meat, unless you
enjoy digging into a salt lick on your plate.

Charlie’s Pork Brine
Charlie Lamb of Charlie’s Butcher Block used early competitions to hone his
barbecue skills, picking the brains of fellow cooks but says that getting your
hands dirty is the best way to progress: “The more you do it, the better you
get — as long as you learn from your mistakes,” he said. “Experiment, and
don’t get discouraged.” His brine recipe is simplicity defined, belying its
delicious effect.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes, plus time to cool
Yield: 3 quarts
3 quarts water
3⁄4 cup kosher salt
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 In a large stock pot, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Bring to a boil.
3 Remove from heat and let cool.
4 Add pork, and brine in the refrigerator for as long as 24 hours.
Variation: Charlie says that you can add any flavor you like to turn this brine
into a marinade. He recommends fresh garlic and black peppercorns but
encourages you to get creative.
Make sure that whenever you brine meat, you do so in the refriger-
ator or in a cooler. You want to make sure the temperature of the
brine and the meat stays below 40 degrees.

Poultry and Pork Brine
The KRE Smokers team uses this recipe for whole turkey or chicken, and
the team smokes it with pecan and hickory, and then a little cherry wood to
give the bird color at the end.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 1 gallon
10 cups apple juice
6 cups water
1 cup coarse kosher salt
1⁄4 cup sugar
1⁄4 cup brown sugar
1 In a large pot, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Warm over low heat until sugars and salt dissolve.
3 Let cool in refrigerator until cold.
4 Add meat and brine (12 to 14 hours for turkey or pork loin, less for
smaller meats).
5 After marinating, rinse brine off meat before cooking or adding other 
seasonings.
Many of the meats you find in grocery stores have been
“enhanced” with a solution that’s much like a brine. Manufacturers
inject a mix of water, salt, and sodium phosphate to do basically
the same thing you do at home with a brine. The theory is just the
same: The salt opens up space within the proteins for the water to
hang out and keep the meat moist. The sodium phosphate helps
the meat hold onto the added water. Enhanced meats may also
contain compounds that inhibit bacteria from growing.
Enhanced meat isn’t necessarily bad (although it does obviously
contain a lot more sodium than meat alone), but it makes your job
harder. With all those added elements, you have less control over
the end result of your cooking. Did you oversalt your dry rub or
was all that salt in the chicken already?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that any enhanced
meat is clearly labeled. Keep an eye out for fine print that includes
words like marinated, injected, or enhanced.

Finding formulas for marinades
Marinades hold a lot of power but unfortunately don’t reach the
magic status that some people attribute to them. Meat is mostly
water to begin with, and flavor itself is fat soluble instead of water
soluble, meaning that the two aren’t exactly a match made in meat
heaven. Even so, soaking a meat in marinade does a lot to impart
flavor, and the acid in a marinade works to tenderize the meat.
(Chapter 5 tells you more about the process.)
Chapter 7: Mixing Tried-and-True Marinades 97
Rub and Marinade for 
Eight-Bone Pork Roast
The results of this pork roast are impressive enough that the simplicity of
Paul Kirk’s recipe is a surprise.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 1⁄2 cup rub and 1 roast (about 6 to 8 servings)
1⁄4 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons red port wine
2 tablespoons cane syrup
2 tablespoons muscadine jelly
1⁄4 cup minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup chicken broth
1 roast, about 6 to 8 pounds
1 In a small bowl, combine the butter, port, syrup, and jelly.
2 Spread mixture over roast.
3 In a second small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.
4 Add the broth to the roasting pan for grill or smoker.
5 Cook at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until internal temperature reaches
145 degrees for medium rare.
A thick-skinned wild grape that grows best in hot, humid climates,
muscadines have a delicate, sweet flavor. Muscadines have black
or purple skin, unless they’re scuppernogs, a greenish-bronze-
skinned variety of muscadine. You find them growing primarily in
the southeastern United States, where they’ve become a favorite of
jelly makers. Live elsewhere? You can most likely find muscadine
jelly (or syrup, or even wine) in gourmet shops or order it online.

The basil breakdown
Maybe the best remnant of the disco era, basil started taking hold in American cook-
ing late in the 1970s and has since become almost a staple, trickling down from fine
dining to even fast-food restaurants. It got a late start in the United States, but it’s
been around for thousands of years and a part of many cuisines during that time.
Basil is an aromatic herb and shows up in endless varieties, but the one you most
commonly find in the grocery store is sweet basil. Even that may taste very differ-
ent (bringing flavors as diverse as lime and cinnamon) depending on where and
how it’s grown.
Hindus include a particular species of basil — Ocimum sanctum, also called tulsi or
holy basil — in their religious practice and use it as a remedy for insect bites, colds,
stress, and a host of other ailments.
Basil is an easy plant to grow. A single plant can produce more than a family can
handle during the course of a summer, and it flourishes inside as well. Good thing,
because, like many fresh herbs, basil can cost a mint at the grocery.
Garlic Basil Chicken Marinade
Garlic cloves and fresh basil add discernable but not overpowering flavor to
Paul Kirk’s chicken marinade.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 11⁄2 cups
1⁄2 cup white wine vinegar
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice
1⁄4 cup distilled water
8 fresh basil leaves
4 large garlic cloves
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1⁄2 cup canola oil
1 In food processor, combine vinegar, lemon juice, water, basil, garlic, sea
salt, and black pepper.
2 Process, slowly adding oil in a steady stream. Store in refrigerator in air-
tight container.

Prepping Beef and Lamb with
Flavors That Blare or Whisper
Beef and lamb tend to have some intense flavors right out of the
gate. You can work with a marinade to override those by applying
intense flavors or give them just a complement of soft marinade
flavors.

Cajun Marinade for 
Grilled Beef Tenderloin
Paul Kirk puts beef tenderloin right in the name of this recipe, but you have
no reason not to use it on any old steak you may want to throw on the grill.
Kirk’s recipe makes enough marinade for about 4 to 6 pounds of beef.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 to 8 hours of marinade time
Yield: 3⁄4 cup marinade
1⁄4 cup Louisiana hot sauce
1⁄4 cup teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 garlic cloves, pressed
1 tablespoon Creole or Cajun seasoning
1 In a small bowl, combine all ingredients.
2 Refrigerate or use right away.

Vietnamese Lemongrass Rub
This recipe from Brandon Hamilton creates a wet rub — any seasoning mix
that incorporates a little oil to form a paste. The lemongrass offers a nice
summery flavor that pairs especially well with lamb. You can use this rub
with seafood or chicken, too.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None.
Yield: 4 servings
3 fresh lemongrass stalks, root end
trimmed and 1 or 2 outer leaves
discarded from each stalk
2 shallots, chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
2 teaspoons freshly chopped and peeled
ginger
Zest of 1 lemon
Juice of 1 lime
11⁄2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt 
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons fish sauce (optional)
5 tablespoons peanut oil or vegetable oil
1 Thinly slice bottom 6 inches of the lemongrass, discarding the remainder.
2 Puree lemongrass, shallots, garlic, ginger, lemon zest, lime juice, sugar,
salt, cayenne, water, and fish sauce in a food processor, scraping down
the sides occasionally, until as smooth as possible, about 2 minutes.
3 To finish the rub, slowly drizzle the peanut oil or vegetable oil into the
rub mixture while the food processor is on. Continue processing until oil
is incorporated.
Note: Use the wet rub just like you would a marinade, letting it sit on the meat
in the refrigerator to absorb the flavors. Blot off the wet rub before you cook.
You can find lemongrass in the produce sections of most grocery
stores. It’s a perennial grass that has an extremely tough texture
but a very fresh and light lemon flavor that is used a lot in Thai and
Vietnamese cooking. Look for firm stalks that are pale yellow or
white at the bottom and green elsewhere. Leave browned stalks of
lemongrass in the store. If you’re having trouble finding lemon-
grass, try an Asian market.

Chapter 7: Mixing Tried-and-True Marinades 101
Teriyaki Marinade
This recipe from the Team N2Que works as well with chicken or fish as it
does with steak.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 1⁄4 cup
1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 minced shallot
1⁄2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 Combine all ingredients in a large freezer bag or plastic bowl with lid and
mix.
2 Refrigerate or use right away.
Tip: See Chapter 5 for advice about marinade times.
Playing barbecue doctor: Getting marinade
down deep with injections
Marinade doesn’t exactly invade meat like the Vikings into the British Isles. It just
can’t find its way into the middle of the meat without a little help. Injecting the mari-
nade into the meat solves the problem, putting the juicy, flavorful marinade right
where you want it. Injecting the marinade into the meat cuts down on the time you
need to let it sit before cooking because you don’t have to wait around for it to mosey
into the heart of the meat.
A number of meat injectors are available online and in kitchen stores. They’re like
extra-big syringes that you draw marinade into and then poke into the meat so that
you can slowly push the marinade right into the fibers.
Injecting meat doesn’t require any special talent; you don’t need to study up on spe-
cial techniques to get this simple job done. Just make sure to inject the marinade
throughout the meat so that you don’t end up with concentrations of marinade in
some spots and untouched meat in others.

Hot Pepper Steak Marinade
A standby for Team Pepperitaville, this super-spicy marinade works espe-
cially well for steak, but it’s nice on chicken or pork, too. And just in case
you’re planning to cook venison, as the team often does, add Italian dress-
ing to the mix.
Preparation time: 45 minutes (including roasting and peeling)
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 3 cups
10 jalapeño peppers
5 cayenne peppers
1 green bell pepper
2 banana peppers
4 Roma tomatoes
2 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
1⁄2 cup vinegar
1 cup water
Juice of 1⁄2 lime
1 cup packed brown sugar
1⁄4 cup granulated sugar
1⁄4 cup soy sauce
6 ounces tomato paste
1 Roast jalapeño, cayenne, green bell, and banana peppers (see Chapter 12
for instructions; the oven-roasting method works better for the smaller
peppers).
2 Peel and deseed roasted peppers, wearing plastic gloves or washing your
hands immediately afterward.
3 Peel tomatoes (see Chapter 12) and garlic.
4 In food processor, process tomatoes and garlic until they’re almost
smooth.
5 In a medium pot, combine pepper mixture and all other ingredients.
6 Over medium heat, cook mixture until it reaches the consistency you
want. (It thickens as it cooks.)
7 Let cool and pour into airtight storage containers.
Note: A little of this mix goes a long way, but the marinade keeps well in the
fridge for a good long time, so this 3-cup batch is likely to last a while.

Brisket Marinade
Sweet as Coke tastes when you drink it, it offers acidity in recipes like this
one, from the GB-Que team.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None, but 8 hours to marinate
Yield: About 13⁄4 cups
12-ounce can of Coke
1⁄4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon chipotle pepper flakes
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
Salt and pepper to taste
Hot sauce to taste
1 In large bowl, mix all ingredients.
2 Use immediately or cover and store in refrigerator.
Hard-working muscles are the hardest to cook to tenderness, and
brisket comes in large part from a cow’s pectoral muscle, one of
the toughest parts of the cow — in both senses of the word.
Turning a tough cut tender is very different from just tossing a New
York strip onto the grill. Brisket needs to reach a higher internal
temperature than other cuts of beef do before it’s at its best. Make
sure you bring your brisket to an internal temperature of at least
185 degrees. (See Chapter 4 for more information on target internal
temperatures and for the basics about cooking brisket.) Anything
less than 185 degrees and you haven’t given the collagen enough
time to break down. Experiment with cooking brisket even to as
high a temperature as 195 degrees as you figure out which method
produces the texture you like best.

Mixing Citrus Marinades 
for Poultry or Shrimp
Mixing lemon, lime, orange, and so on into a marinade is a peachy
way to tenderize it. Fresh is preferable because the flavors are
more intense when they’re coming right out of the fruit instead of
out of a container, but using canned or otherwise packaged juice
works fine, too.
Part II: Preparation Prevails: Using Rubs and Marinades 
104
Lemon Marinade 
for Smoked Turkey
Raisins add sweetness, and the cilantro and mint leaves give a nice sharp
flavor to this marinade by Paul Kirk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups
1 cup water
1⁄4 cup golden raisins
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, minced
2 tablespoons mint leaves, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
Zest of one lemon
1 cup olive oil
1 In a small pan, bring the water to a boil.
2 Add the raisins, remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes.
3 Drain the water from the raisins and combine with remaining ingredients
in a medium bowl.
Because you smoke a turkey over such low heat, stuffing becomes
a problem. Cooking it on its own, in the oven, works better than
cramming it into the bird, an alternative that may not bring the
stuffing up to the right temperature. Anyway, smoke flavor doesn’t
do much for stuffing, so keeping it out of the range of your hickory
is preferable by far.
White meat cooks faster than dark meat, and any meat close to the
bone is going to be holding a lot more heat than the rest of the bird,
so when you test for doneness (a minimum of 165 degrees), make
sure your thermometer is hitting the center of the breast. Salmonella
is a dark, uncomfortable cloud hanging over your dinner.

Chapter 7: Mixing Tried-and-True Marinades 105
Sweet and Sour Orange 
Marinade for Shrimp
Hot isn’t in the title for Paul Kirk’s recipe, but you do get the teeniest under-
score of heat from the Anaheim chile. Try using a hotter pepper, like jalapeño,
if you want further zing.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1 Anaheim chile, seeded and minced
3 large garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons orange zest
1 teaspoon peeled, minced ginger
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon ground Szechuan pepper
1 pound uncooked shrimp
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together all ingredients except the shrimp.
2 Add the shrimp to the marinade. Cover and refrigerate an hour or two.
A low- or medium-hot grill does great things for shrimp, which
easily pick up charcoal flavor. The little suckers cook in no time,
though, so keep a close eye on them and turn them as soon as you
see that one side is pink. The second side won’t take as much time
as the first, so be at the ready with tongs to snatch the shrimp
from the heat as soon as both sides have lost their translucence.
Putting a pair of skewers through the shrimp makes them easier to
handle, preventing them from rotating on the skewer. Just put two
thin skewers about an inch apart through the shrimp to ensure
that they don’t tear or turn.

A
sk most people what makes great barbecue, and they
tell you it’s all in the sauce. (No sauce is going to
make desiccated pork butt taste like the food of the gods
but, hell, it can cover a few barbecue sins.) In this part,
you ﬁnd out about using sauces and get inspirations for
dreaming up your own rave-inducing versions. I give you
traditional recipes from all four American barbecue
regions and unexpected sauces from all over the world.

L
eave your meat in the smoker too long, and your friends may
let you forget it, but present a mundane sauce, and you break
what many people consider an unpardonable barbecue sin.
(They’re right only in part: How well you prepare and cook meat is
at least as important as your sauce, but in many minds, sauce is
the whole story of barbecue. Can’t fight conviction.)
In this part, you find barbecue recipes from all four barbecue
regions and some that may hitherto never have been part of
American barbecue. But if you really want to get adventurous, run
right past the exotic sauces and concoct your own from-scratch
barbecue sauce. Doing so is a great party trick because the reality
is that it’s not as complicated as most people think.
As I tell you in Chapter 4, you use different barbecue sauces at
three different stages of preparing your food:
 The tomatoey, sugary barbecue sauce that so many people
equate with barbecue itself is not a good match for the heat of
the grill and tends to burn, so save it for the last few minutes
of cooking, brush it on after you’ve pulled cooked meat from
the smoker, or serve it as a dipping sauce.
 Sauces made from bases like vinegar and mustard rather than
tomato can be used as mop sauces. You regularly slather mop
sauces on your food as it cooks.

The recipes in this part of the book give you a wide range of sauces
not just from around the country but from around the world. In
this chapter, I home in on how to create your own traditional 
barbecue sauce from scratch.
Choosing a Base
The base you use makes up the largest part of your sauce,
although it won’t necessarily end up being the most notable flavor.
Sauce bases set the tone and hold your other ingredients together
in a harmonious mix.
Three bases serve as starting block for most of the barbecue sauce
that cooks in the United States stake their names on:
 Mustard: Sauces that start with mustard run the gamut, show-
ing up in sweet or spicy versions and most often served along-
side pork. Mustard and pork bring out the best in each other.
 Tomato: Almost synonymous with “barbecue” for many
people, tomato-based sauce is the one that fills grocery store
shelves and most regularly coats ribs, pulled pork, and so on.
Tomatoes are a tangy canvas for sweet sauces and equally at
home with sharp, spicy ingredients.
 Vinegar: Thin, vinegar-based sauces contain little that’s neu-
tral enough to diffuse the strong flavors within them — usu-
ally red pepper flakes or pepper sauce, maybe a pinch of
sugar. Some add a little tomato or Worcestershire, but vinegar
(often apple cider and white vinegars) is responsible for most
of the oomph.
Mayonnaise-based “white sauce” is a wild card that originated in
Alabama (and has pretty much stayed there, so far). The tart sauce
usually includes apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, cayenne pepper,
and sugar. You find a recipe for it in Chapter 9.
Treat white sauce as you would a tomato-based version, keeping it
away from heat until the last few minutes of cooking to keep the
mayonnaise from separating. You also can use it as a marinade
before you get cooking.
White sauce tastes great on chicken, turkey, and pork, and you can
use it as a dressing for salads or coleslaw.

Striking a Balance
Despite every successful barbecue cook holding his recipes close
to the vest, a basic formula for sauce is no secret at all. Every
sauce that works has a balance of sweet, sour, and seasonings.
Many throw in heat, too, to keep things interesting.
As you work on your own sauce recipe, effect change step by step.
If you mess with too many elements at a time, you can’t pin down
what’s keeping the sauce from working. Change just one part of the
recipe for a subsequent batch, and you leave no mystery as to
what’s making the difference, and then you know better how to
proceed toward your masterpiece.
When you start dreaming up your own sauce, keep in mind that
you want one element to do most of the work. A sauce needs an
identity if it’s to become a standout. If you prefer a sweet sauce, let
an element like apricot preserves take the stage and give hot ele-
ments the role of backup singer. If you want a sour, vinegary sauce,
heat and sweet do the doo-wop work.
The following sections run down the common ingredients that go
into the various elements of great sauces.
Sweet ideas
Standard granulated sugar works for adding sweetness, sure, but
so do a lot of other ingredients, many of which add much more
interesting combinations of flavors along with the sweet:
 Brown sugar
 Fruit juices (anything from apple to raspberry or 
pomegranate)
 Fruit preserves, jams, or jellies
 Honey
 Light corn syrup
 Maple syrup
 Molasses
Chapter 8: Sorting through the Sauce Story 111

Sour notions
If you’re going to have a little sweet in your sauce, you need some
sour, too, to keep the mix from becoming more of a dessert glaze
than a suitable topper for meat. Here are the most-used options:
 Lemon or lime juice
 Prepared mustard
 Vinegar
 Worcestershire sauce
Seasonings
Pungent fresh vegetables like onions, garlic, and peppers add a lot
of depth (and in some cases a little sweetness) to your sauce.
Dried herbs and spices go even farther. Less usually is more when
it comes to seasonings, so proceed carefully as you season your
sauce.
Part III: The All-Important Sauce Story 
112
The making (and using) of molasses
Molasses isn’t necessarily a staple in today’s kitchens, but it was the sweetener of
choice until granulated white sugar became affordable in the late 19th century.
Molasses is the syrup that arises during the cane sugar refining process. Sugar
cane is crushed to pull out its juices, and the juice is heated to separate the sugar
into crystals and syrup.
The process of refining sugar requires several stages. Molasses may come from
the first stage, in which case it’s called, fittingly enough, first molasses. (Later boil-
ings of the molasses draw out more sugars and lead to darker and darker molasses.)
The darker the molasses, the less sweetness it’s going to have. Molasses lends
deeper and more complex flavors than table sugar; it’s a little heartier and has a
sharp tinge on the tongue that sugar doesn’t give you.
Molasses doesn’t just make pumpkin pie and gingerbread cookies taste good; it has
a long history of use as a laxative, and currently blackstrap molasses (the darkest
and most bitter form) has a reputation as a health boost, in part because of its high
concentrations of iron and calcium. It also has an almost mythical status, drawing
claims that it has cured cancer and arthritis and even restored natural color to gray
hair. The jury’s out on those bits, but a host of pit masters can attest to its benefits
to barbecue sauce.

Here are some of the seasonings that commonly make it into bar-
becue sauces:
 Allspice
 Celery seed
 Cinnamon
 Garlic powder
 Ginger
 Onion powder
Chapter 5 runs down a lot of the surefire seasoning combinations.
Hot touches
Not every sauce is a hot sauce, but even sweet sauces do well with
a little something spicy, which, if you add it with a very cautious
hand, actually underscores the sweet effect you’re going for.
Then, of course, there are four-alarm-fire sauces that throw the 
balance in the opposite direction, using a little something sweet to
create depth and complement the tongue-scorching elements
within the sauce.
Adding prepared hot sauce is a reasonable shortcut and creates
good results. Here are some further suggestions for fueling a fire:
 Black pepper (fresh ground)
 Cayenne pepper
 Chili powder
 Chipotle (smoked jalapeño) peppers or sauce
 Cloves
 Crushed red pepper
 Dry mustard
 Horseradish
 Minced fresh hot peppers (jalapeño, habanero, serrano, and
so on)
 Paprika
 Pure chile powders from ancho, pasilla, caribe, or other hot
peppers

Finding Exotic Inspirations 
for Terrific Sauces
Traditional sauces are just that. They use ingredients that most
people associate with barbecue (although in an endless variety of
proportions and combinations). If you want to step outside the
barbecue comfort zone, you might try working with some of the
idea starters you find in Table 8-1.

114
Smoke in a bottle
Given the provenance of barbecue and of smoking, it’s ironic and just plain weird
that you can now buy smoke in a bottle.
Liquid smoke is made from the condensed smoke coming off popular barbecue
woods like hickory and mesquite as they’re heated. The liquid is collected, filtered,
and then bottled and shipped to the shelves of a grocery store near you. (Look for
it among the condiments.)
In most cases, nothing goes into the bottle but the condensed smoke. Still, there’s
a distinct flavor about most liquid smoke products on the market that make it easily
discernable from the flavor that slow-smoking provides. It’s a shortcut, and short-
cuts tend not to come off as well as the real thing.
Still, if you’re time crunched or live in an apartment or anywhere else that keeps
you from doing actual smoking (or if you just have no interest in the smoking
process), liquid smoke is a viable alternative. Its flavor is super-concentrated, so
you need only a few drops to give smoke flavor to a sauce. It’s a nice touch for bar-
becue sauces, of course, and it may make more of your marinade, too. Liquid smoke
also makes a showing in many cooks’ salsas, and it jazzes up plain old ketchup for
your hamburgers, too.

Using plum sauce
Plum sauce is one element of the Thai sweet chile sauce in Table 8-1, and a good
condiment all on its own. The tart and sweet sauce ends up on tables in most
Chinese restaurants, and it can do good things for barbecue sauce, too.
Made with vinegar and sugar (and usually a few seasonings; ginger is a popular
one), plum sauce has many of the elements you’d put into your sauce anyway,
making it a fair shortcut. Plum wine makes a nice addition, too.
You can find plum sauce and plum wine (and other faces of Chinese plums, like dried
or pickled versions that may also make interesting elements of sauce) in any Asian
market.

Beale Street Memphis Sauce
Mustard, tomato, and vinegar are common characteristics of Tennessee
sauces. Schneider says his Beale Street Memphis sauce is ideal for pulled
pork, Memphis-style — drizzled on top of coleslaw piled atop the pork in a
sandwich.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 3 cups
2 cups ketchup
1⁄2 cup cider vinegar
8-ounce can tomato puree
1⁄4 cup prepared yellow mustard
3⁄4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne chili powder
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and stir well.
2 Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce
heat to low.
3 Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.
Tip: Make sure that the pan is cool when you add the mustard. The mustard
distributes most effectively when it’s cool.
Originally, Memphis barbecue meant dry-rubbed ribs without
sauce of any kind, and you still find many of the Memphis pit mas-
ters making their ribs that way. Sauce eventually trickled into the
Memphis barbecue profile, and maybe because the area is closer
to the Carolinas than it is to Kansas City, the sauce typically served

there is heavy on vinegar and mustard — the hallmarks of Carolina
sauces. When you do find sauce served with barbecue in Memphis,
it’s more likely to be on the side than it is to be drenched over the
meat.
Texas sauces run the gamut; you’re as likely to fine a sweet, thick
sauce in Texas as you are to find a vinegary and spicy version. One
thing you can count on is finding brisket (c’mon — this is cattle
country) and hot links, spicy smoked sausages that are a product
of German influence in the state.
Chapter 9: Crafting Barbecue Sauces Traditional and Unusual 119
Texas Steer Ranch Sauce
Schneider points out that Texas sauces can range from thick, tomato-based
versions to the more commonly found thinner, peppery, and coffee-accented
sauce with Tex-Mex-influenced seasonings. This one more closely follows the
latter lines.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 31⁄2 cups
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups ketchup
8-ounce can tomato puree
3⁄4 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup black coffee
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne chili powder
1 In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
2 Add the remaining ingredients. Stir well. Increase heat to medium and
bring to a simmer.
3 Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.
Note: Instant coffee will work just fine for this recipe; add a teaspoon or two
extra coffee crystals so the flavor will come through in the sauce.

Hyping coffee for cooking
Given its traditional place as a with-dessert beverage, finding coffee in recipes for
cakes and other sweets is no surprise. It’s less common in savory recipes, but the
same things that make it interesting in desserts make it a natural for sauces and dry
rubs.
Within each puny bean you find a range of intense flavors — tastes that range from
earthy to chocolaty and spicy to buttery. That complexity means that coffee com-
plements pretty much anything and can bring out unexpected flavors in whatever
you’re cooking.
You find coffee in Tom Schneider’s Texas Steer Ranch Sauce in this section.
Alabama White Sauce
Schneider notes that this sauce isn’t one you’re going to run into unless
you’re within the Alabama state lines, but it’s a phenomenon in that area,
popularized by one of the big names of Alabama barbecue — Big Bob
Gibson Bar-B-Q, a longstanding restaurant.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups
11⁄2 cups mayonnaise
1⁄2 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon salt
Whisk all ingredients together until smooth.
Note: Baste chicken and ribs in the final minutes of grilling and serve as a dip-
ping sauce. Store this sauce in the fridge for a night or so, and the horseradish
flavor becomes more apparent.
White sauce is a wild card of barbecue sauces. It somehow has
earned legendary status without significantly venturing out of its
home area.

You need to use care when you cook with it, because mayonnaise
doesn’t handle heat well. Your best bet is to baste it on during the
last few minutes of cooking and serve more of it on the side. If you
put on the white sauce too early, the mayonnaise separates and
the sauce becomes less effective and much less appealing.
White sauce makes a good condiment for many different foods.
You find another mayo recipe — for Anthony Hanslits’s Wasabi
Mayo — in Chapter 11.
Chapter 9: Crafting Barbecue Sauces Traditional and Unusual 121
Kansas City BBQ Sauce
The sweet, thick tomato sauces of the region have taken hold far outside
Kansas city. “Kansas City is considered by some as the heart of the U.S. bar-
becue world,” Schneider says, “but don’t tell that to a Texan or a Carolinian.”
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 3 cups
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups tomato puree
3⁄4 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup light corn syrup
1⁄2 cup vinegar
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon liquid smoke
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄2 teaspoon ground celery seed
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.
2 Add the remaining ingredients, gently stir, and then simmer for 15 min-
utes. Remove from heat; cool.
Kansas City–style barbecue sauce is kind of like reality TV: It has
completely permeated American culture, and not for any good
reason. Nothing about it makes it better for barbecue than, say, a
vinegar or mustard sauce — even a mayonnaise sauce. In the
democracy of sales figures, though, Kansas City barbecue sauce is
elected by a landslide.
You find further versions of this thick, tomatoey, sweet sauce in
the upcoming section, “Cooking Up More Classic Barbecue
Sauces.”

Carolina “East” Raleigh Sauce
This style of sauce meets the original standards for barbecue sauce — to
simply tenderize and flavor the meat. Schneider’s version sticks with
Eastern Carolina traditions.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup
1 cup cider vinegar
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
11⁄2 teaspoons salt
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar (optional)
1 In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.
Note: Use this sauce as a baste over pork during smoking and as a dipping
sauce.
Carolina “West” Piedmont Sauce
This type of sauce starts off the same as its cousin out east, Schneider says,
but may bring ketchup and molasses into the mix.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups
1 cup cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup ketchup
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
11⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon dry ground mustard
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Simmer over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.

Cooking Up More Classic 
Barbecue Sauces
Given the prevalence of thick, tomato-based sauces on grocery
shelves and in barbecue joints around the country, it’s no surprise
that the recipes in this section contain several versions that fit in
that category.
Little tweaks may have a ripple effect in a sauce, pulling out flavors
you never knew were there, so within the tomato-based category
lies a great deal of room for variation. And you’re always welcome
to modify at will. Think bourbon belongs in every sauce? I wouldn’t
argue. Like it heavy on mustard? Fire at will.

Original BBQ Sauce
You can’t beat a classic. Or so says John Webb of the Up-in-Smoke team,
who confesses that no matter how much he experiments, he always comes
back to this basic sauce, which he uses with the Up in Smoke mop sauce
you find in Chapter 10.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 30 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups
2 teaspoons chili powder
4 heaping tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon molasses
1 tablespoon dried onions
1 cup apple cider
2⁄3 cup apple cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup ketchup
1⁄2 small red onion, chopped fine
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a slow boil
over medium heat.
2 Continue boiling 15 minutes, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat;
cool.
Note: The sauce thickens further when you store it overnight in the fridge.
Variation: Sauté 3 minced garlic cloves in 1 tablespoon butter until caramelized.
Add 1⁄2 cup red wine and simmer to reduce the wine to a couple tablespoons.
Follow instructions for original sauce, reducing vinegar by 1⁄3 cup.

124
Chipotle-Maple Barbeque Sauce
Maple syrup and minced chipotle peppers give Paul Kirk’s recipe a smoky-
sweet punch.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: About 21⁄2 cups
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup minced onion
2 large garlic cloves, pressed
1 cup canned chicken broth
1 cup ketchup
1⁄4 cup real maple syrup
1 tablespoon minced chipotle pepper
(canned in adobo sauce)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon allspice
1 In a large saucepan, heat the oil and sauté the onion over medium heat for
5 minutes.
2 Stir in garlic and sauté 2 minutes.
3 Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
4 Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, or until thickened.
5 Remove from heat and let cool.
6 Optional: Pour into food processor or blender and puree until smooth.
Chipotle peppers are a natural fit for barbecue because they have
a similar provenance. Because jalepeño peppers rot quickly, they
were smoked as a preservation method. The result is called a
chipotle pepper.
You can buy whole chipotle peppers; a chipotle powder also is
available. (It shows up in some of the recipes in this book.) The
kind of chipotle you want for Paul Kirk’s Chipotle-Maple Barbeque
Sauce is the kind you find in cans with adobo sauce. These chipo-
tles have been stewed in adobo, a sauce made from tomatoes,
garlic, vinegar, a bunch of other chiles, and cinnamon, among
other seasonings.

Chipotle peppers in adobo will keep in your refrigerator for a good
long time (at least three months), but if you get antsy to use up
what you have left over, you can easily puree the peppers with the
adobo sauce and butter or mayo to create a nice topper for fish,
especially shrimp.
If you’re intense like that, you also can smoke jalapeños yourself 
to make your own chipotles. Instructions are at www.recipe

Rib Runner Sauce
The Rib Runners team uses this sauce on chicken and pork. They say plenty
of trial and error brought them to the recipe.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: About 31⁄2 cups
1⁄4 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon margarine
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup chili sauce 
1⁄2 cup Kraft honey barbecue sauce
1⁄2 cup Kraft original barbecue sauce
1 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1⁄4 teaspoon liquid smoke
A few dashes red hot sauce
1 In a heavy stock pot, sauté the onion and garlic in margarine over medium
heat.
2 Stir in the remaining ingredients.
3 Simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.

Pork Sauce
As the name indicates, this sauce is a winner on pork, and the Pirates of the
Grill team particularly advises that you use it for pulled pork.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 21⁄2 cups
1 cup ketchup
1 cup water
1⁄3 cup cider vinegar
1⁄3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon molasses
1⁄2 teaspoon celery seed
1⁄2 teaspoon salt or seasoned salt
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a slow boil.
2 Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 15 min-
utes. Remove from heat; cool.
Kentucky Bourbon BBQ Sauce
Tom Schneider says the bourbon and butter in his sauce give it a smooth,
unique flavor, while the Worcestershire sauce (always part of the
“Owensboro black” sauces in Kentucky) leaves a decided tang.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 3 cups
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups ketchup
1 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup bourbon
1⁄4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon allspice
1 In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.
2 Add the remaining ingredients.

3 Stir well, and then bring to a light simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove
from heat; cool.
In northwestern Kentucky, the black sauce that originated in
Owensboro sits on restaurant tables in bottles and is poured over
meat, especially mutton (which has a strong flavor about it to
begin with, coming as it does from older sheep, and can use a
douse of strong flavor).

The jazz on jerk
The jerk seasoning you need for the Paradise BBQ Sauce is easy enough to find on
the shelves of any grocery store; the story behind the style of cooking that relies on
it has a lot in common with barbecue. Jerk cooking is the Jamaican version of slow
smoking, often done over a pit or a halved steel drum and using pimento wood. Rubs
and marinades are a big part of the process, and the flavors that most commonly
show up in jerk cooking include Scotch Bonnet chilies, allspice, cinnamon, ginger,
and thyme. Like barbecue, the origin of the term jerk is up for debate, with some
theories attributing it to a Spanish word for dried meat or from the practice of jerk-
ing cooked meat from a pig carcass.
Maple Syrup Barbeque Sauce
Maple syrup and brown sugar provide the sweetness in this well-balanced
sauce from Paul Kirk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

1 cup ketchup
1 cup minced onion
1⁄4 cup brown sugar, packed
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice
1⁄4 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons chopped garlic

1⁄4 teaspoon hot sauce
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 In a large saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.
2 Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.
3 Pour into food processor or blender and puree until smooth.

Spiced Mustard Sauce
When you’re ready for something other than the common red barbecue
sauce, give this mustard version from Rich Allen of Dick’s Bodacious 
Bar-B-Q, Inc., a whirl.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup
1⁄2 cup Dijon mustard
1⁄2 cup apple juice
1⁄2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients.
2 Simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently with a whisk.
Use immediately or store in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
Bringing Fruit Flavor to Sauces
with Juices and Jams
Fruit offers a fuller-bodied kind of sweetness than does white
sugar, which has nothing but sucrose in its flavor profile. The extra
depth makes using fruit juices and jellies a fantastic way to
sweeten your sauces.
Honey-Orange BBQ Sauce
Roger Mogg of the Smoky River BBQ Team cooked by feel until his wife
explained the error of his ways. This recipe, which he says he uses just like
ketchup, is the first one he committed to paper.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups

1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.
2 Bring sauce to boil.
3 Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until sauce
thickens. Remove from heat; cool.
Variation: Try grapefruit or other citrus juices in place of the orange or 
pineapple juice. Add a teaspoon or two of cayenne or habanero powder to
spice things up.

11⁄2 cups ketchup
1⁄2 cup apple cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons orange juice
2 tablespoons pineapple juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1⁄2 tablespoon liquid smoke
1⁄2 tablespoon onion powder
1⁄2 tablespoon garlic powder
1⁄2 tablespoon black pepper

Paul Kirk gives his apple barbecue sauce a unique, savory edge with fresh
minced ginger.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups
1⁄2 cup apple jelly
8-ounce can tomato sauce
1⁄4 cup sweet rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons apple juice
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon Louisiana hot sauce
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Bring to a boil, stirring until smooth.
3 Reduce heat, and simmer about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat; cool.

Tip: Freeze ginger root before you use it. Frozen ginger is easier to handle and
slice or grate than warmer ginger. And you can store the root in your freezer
for a few months without harming it.
Louisiana hot sauce is any thin, bottled hot sauce that’s made from
red chiles and vinegar. Several hot pepper sauces, Tabasco
included, fit into this category. The Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is
a milder version of the form.
You can find hot sauces that reach into high end of the Scoville
scale that measures capsaicin to indicate the “heat” of a pepper.
The hottest pepper on record measures up to 1 million Scoville
units, but some sauces claim to reach more than 10 million Scoville
units. (You find out more about measuring the heat of peppers in
Chapter 11.)

Harvest Apricot Sauce
Ginger and jalapeño bite through the sweetness of the apricots, giving this
sauce a perfect balance of sweet and hot. Rich Allen, founder of Dick’s
Bodacious Bar-B-Q, Inc., created this recipe.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 1 1/2 cups sauce
10-ounce can apricot preserves
1⁄2 cup apple cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 fresh jalapeño, seeded and minced
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients.
2 Simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently with a whisk.
Use immediately or store in the refrigerator in an airtight container.

Chapter 10
Getting Saucy while You 
Cook: Mop Sauces
In This Chapter
 Using sauces to baste grilled or smoked meats
 Concocting a sauce that stands up to heat
 Melding flavors for memorable meat
A
lesson learned the hard way by
almost every beginning cook is that
barbecue sauce can’t stand the heat.
Traditional barbecue sauce burns, as does
most heavy sauce with a tomato or sugary
base. Brush it onto chicken or ribs early in
the cooking, and you end up with a black-
ened exterior instead of the full, toothsome flavor (and texture)
you were looking for.
Enter mop sauces. These lighter sauces are formulated not only to
add flavor and juiciness to your meat but to do it on a hot grill or
in a smoker.
You use mop sauces to add moisture to meat and, if they include
an acid like vinegar or citrus juice, to help keep it tender. You can
make them from just a few ingredients or using other barbecue ele-
ments you may have on hand, which means that mop sauces are
an easy area to dip your toes into the waters of experimentation.
Here are a few suggestions for crafting a mop without too much
trouble:
 Make use of marinade. Boil any leftover marinade to make
sure it’s free from bacteria, and then dilute it with water. You
can use vinegar or a light fruit juice to dilute it, but only if
those ingredients show up in the marinade. Using something
with a strong flavor will throw off the balance of your
intended flavors, so proceed carefully.

 Start with your dry rub. Combine a few tablespoons of your
dry rub with about a pint of apple juice or cider vinegar — or
both.
 Thin your barbecue sauce. If you use a low-sugar barbecue
sauce, you can dilute it with water, juice, or vinegar until it’s
the right watery consistency for mopping.
 Bring beer to the task. Add beer to your rub or barbecue
sauce to create a mop. Beer is slightly acidic, and it adds
moisture and a gentle, usually pretty neutral flavor that isn’t
going to stomp all over the other flavors in your cooking. And,
you know — it’s practically a staple, so you’re likely to have
some on hand.
If you really want to keep things simple, just bust out the apple
juice. Pour some in a spray bottle and spritz it onto the meat while
it cooks. Apple juice adds moisture, and it’s mild enough that it
won’t assert itself over the primary flavors from the meat or your
seasoning rubs. Apple juice also adds a touch of color and sheen
to ribs or chicken.
No matter which mop sauce you decide to use, you want to brush
or spray it onto the meat you’re cooking approximately every half-
hour.
In this chapter, you find easy recipes for the sauces that can take
the heat.

Finding further uses for hardworking beer
Even if drinking it were the only good purpose beer had going for it, the stuff would
never go out of fashion. Turns out beer is like an all-purpose fix-it, bake-it, clean-it,
and more for household jobs. Kind of like vinegar, only much better for drinking.
Here are several more projects you can assign to beer:
 Washing your hair: Boil it first to take out the drying alcohol, and then wash
your hair with beer. Makes it extra shiny.
 Keeping your copper clean: Beer’s mild acidity makes it a swell way to put a
shine on copper.
 Saving your vegetation: Slugs love beer but don’t know how to stop. Bury a few
jars half-filled with beer in the yard before bed, and you wake up to a whole
mess of drunk, drowned slugs in the morning. Beer also is rumored to improve
brown spots in your lawn.

Making Mops Especially for Pork
Pork dries out easily, but mopping it regularly while it cooks staves
off the unappealing desiccation.
Because of fears of the once-common (and extremely uncomfort-
able) parasitic infection trichinosis, pork often is overcooked by
wary grillers and smokers. The reality is that trichinosis now is
very rare, in large part because of improved feeding and handling
practices.
Bourbon Que Mop Sauce 
for Pork Tenderloin
Bourbon shows up in a goodly number of sauce recipes, and why not? It not
only provides acidity and rich earthiness but also gives a cook something to
sip while he works. This recipe from Paul Kirk uses butter to beef up the
richness factor and add further acidity.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: About 3⁄4 cup
Chapter 10: Getting Saucy while You Cook: Mop Sauces 135
1 whole lemon
1⁄2 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons bourbon
1 tablespoon grated onion
1⁄4 teaspoon hot sauce
1⁄8 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into a small saucepan.
2 Throw the lemon halves into the pan.
3 Turn heat to medium-high and add remaining ingredients, stirring to com-
bine.
4 Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
Note: Brush over tenderloin before cooking, and mop sauce onto meat regu-
larly as it cooks.

Mopping Sauce for Pork Ribs
Charlie Lamb of Charlie’s Butcher Block swears by this deceptively simple,
super-tasty mop recipe.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 21⁄2 cups

136
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup Worcestershire sauce
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients.
Smoke Hunters BBQ Mop
Try The Smoke Hunters’ mop recipe on ribs or pork shoulder. (For the
team’s sauce recipe, Big R’s BBQ Sauce, turn to Chapter 9.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 21⁄4 cups
2 cups apple or pineapple juice
1 stick butter
1⁄2 cup brown sugar.
In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and stir over medium heat
until sugar has dissolved.

Butch’s Whole Pig 
Basting Sauce
Butch Lupinetti did, in fact, throw down Bobby Flay on the cooking competi-
tion show “Throwdown! with Bobby Flay,” where he outcooked the snarky
chef in a barbecue competition. His basting sauce brings a lot of heat to
whatever you use it on.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes
Yield: About 2 gallons
Chapter 10: Getting Saucy while You Cook: Mop Sauces 137
1 gallon apple cider vinegar
4 cups cayenne pepper
1 gallon water
1 cup brown sugar (or to taste)
6 lemons sliced in 1⁄4-inch slices
1 chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 to 3 tablespoons Butch’s Smack
Your Lips Magic Dust (or your own
seasoning rub)
In a large pot, bring all ingredients to a boil. Inject or mop pig generously.
Can also be used as a sopping sauce to dip your cooked meat into — as
long as you like it hot.
Biting into a whole-hog cooking project
Butch’s basting sauce recipe makes enough for a whole hog, but you don’t have to
use it that way. If you’re thinking about smoking a whole hog, keep in mind that for
every 25 pounds of dressed pig, you get about 10 pounds of meat. And buying a
whole hog isn’t like picking up a chicken on the way home from the office — make
sure you give your butcher at least a week’s notice.
Also, you need a grate that’s about 4 feet wide to accommodate a whole hog. Unless
they own monster smokers, most people dig pits and line them with stones or build
temporary pits from concrete blocks and a metal screen. Don’t forget about the
charcoal, either: For a 100-pound hog, you need a good 60 pounds of the stuff.
Finally, unless you’re using a rotisserie, butterflying the hog is the best way to get it
to cook evenly. To butterfly the hog, you need to split the rib bones from the spine
without breaking the skin along.

Concocting Multipurpose Mops
An acid and a lot of liquid are the critical points of a mop sauce;
where you take it from there can be very different depending on
the seasonings you throw into the mix.
The following recipes highlight particularly versatile mop sauces.
Part III: The All-Important Sauce Story 
138
Spicy Mop Sauce
The red pepper flakes in this recipe from Grillmaster’s Garden give a subtle
heat to this mop sauce. Let the sauce sit in the fridge for an hour or two to
give the heat a chance to permeate the liquid and give a better balance to
the sauce.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 cups
1 teaspoon black pepper
11⁄4 cups cider vinegar
2⁄3 cup water
3 tablespoons sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients.
Variation: You can also use this sauce as a marinade. It works well with any
meat. Just soak it in the marinade in the refrigerator according to the time sug-
gestions you find in Chapter 4.
The multipurpose mop
You’re more likely to use a basting brush or small mop brush to apply them to what-
ever you’re cooking, but mop sauces may have gotten their name from early cooks’
using cotton rag mops (the very kind you may use to clean the kitchen floor) to baste
large amounts of meat while it smoked. They’d dip the thing in basting liquid and
heft it up over the meat to coat a lot of it in one sweep. When you consider that a
lot of mop sauces include vinegar — as famous for its cleaning power as for its
meat-tenderizing properties — maybe the practice really wasn’t much of a stretch.

Chapter 10: Getting Saucy while You Cook: Mop Sauces 139
Up in Smoke Mop Sauce
John Webb from the Up-in-Smoke team uses this mop sauce along with his
Original BBQ Sauce (see Chapter 9).
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None (but need to let sit overnight)
Yield: 2 cups
1 cup vinegar
1 cup apple cider
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon fresh ground black pepper
1 In a storage container, combine all ingredients and shake.
2 Let sauce sit in the refrigerator overnight to let flavors combine.

peppers have been attributed with a number of health benefits
including increasing the metabolism, fighting back cancer, and
even eradiating vertigo — chiles show no signs of letting up their
hold on the imagination and palate.
The havoc chiles wreak on your tongue is nothing compared to
what they’ll do to other tender tissues. Your best bet is to wear
rubber gloves when you handle particularly hot peppers. Barring
that, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly after you’re done
touching the peppers. Rubbing your eyes with a hand still doused
in capsaicin — the compound that provides chiles’ heat — is an
agony that doesn’t soon dissipate.

Porkrastinators Pepper Medley 
Hot Sauce
Take a look at the first three ingredients, and you can see why Team
Porkrastinators issues a warning with this recipe: Use it sparingly, they say,
because it packs a mother of a wallop.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups
3 jalapeño peppers
4 habanero peppers
3 cayenne peppers
6 cloves garlic
1 carrot
1⁄2 medium onion, chopped
1 cup water
1 cup cider vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
1 In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.
2 Reduce heat to low.
3 Let mixture simmer until peppers have softened, about 30 minutes.
4 Pour mixture into blender and puree until smooth.
Tip: Because this recipe produces such a scorcher of a hot sauce, you may
want to tone it down. Just cut out the habanero peppers (the hottest chilies the
recipe includes) or, if you want to keep that particular flavor, use only one,
and reduce the number of cayenne and jalapeños that you use by one.

Your impulse when something too hot hits your tongue may be to
slug back water, but doing so only moves the pain-inducing chemi-
cals around in your mouth, causing further discomfort. Milk or
yogurt coats your mouth and braces it for the abuse you’re giving
it. Taking a bite of something bland like rice or bread also can cut
back the afterburn.
Part of the reason hot peppers are so hard to stop eating is because
of the pain they inflict. The injury capsaicin causes your tongue also
leads to the release of endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers;
basically, the pain leads to a feel-good effect. Less scientifically, most
people experience a misguided inclination to take one more bite to
ease the pain. And when that doesn’t work? Another.
Sweetening the Pot: Sauces
with a Softer Side
Failing to explore the spectrum of food flavor is selling your tongue
short — and it may even mess with your health.
Many nutritionists and dietary experts recommend that you
include something to target each of the five primary taste sensa-
tions (sweet, sour, bitter, salty, savory) in a meal to best feel sated
when you’re finished. The theory goes that when you offer a bit of
each to your tongue, your brain calls it a meal much sooner than it
would had you stuck with just one type of taste.
The recipes in this section give you tasty ways to test the theory
by working some sweetness into your meals.
Chapter 11: Sauces and Relishes for Dipping and Dashing 143
The hottest hot pepper?
Scoville units measure the amount of capsaicin in a pepper. A standard orange
habanero pepper has a reputation as a real killer and measures somewhere around
100,000 to 350,000 Scoville units. (The wide variation is a product of the differences
in growing conditions.)
The red savina pepper is a cultivar of the habanero and one that took over its top
spot on the Scoville scale. It has a rating of 350,000 to 580,000 units.
But in 2005, the red savina lost its throne by a long shot when the Bhut Jolokia was
shown to measure 1 million Scoville units. Grown under controlled conditions and
tested at New Mexico State University’s Chile Pepper Institute, the pepper unseated
the red savina in the Guiness World Records in 2007.

Blueberry Balsamic 
Barbeque Sauce
Brandon Hamilton dreamed up this recipe as a way to use up all those extra
blueberries you tend to have at the end of the blueberry season. It’s a light
and summery recipe that partners well with duck, chicken, seafood, and
even beef.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 11⁄2 cups
2 cups fresh (or frozen) blueberries
1⁄2 cup balsamic vinegar
1⁄4 cup apple juice
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon cardamom
1 pinch salt
1 In a saucepan, combine all ingredients.
2 Bring mixture to a boil; then reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes or until
sauce starts to thicken, stirring occasionally.
3 Remove pan from heat, and cool.
4 Transfer sauce to a blender, and process until smooth. Place in a plastic
container with a lid and refrigerate up to 5 days.
Cardamom shows up in a lot of Indian recipes, because the plant
that it comes from is native to the area. What you buy in a jar is
either whole or ground seeds from the pod of the plant (although
you also can buy whole pods), and the plant itself is part of the
same family from which ginger and turmeric hail.
Cardamom has a sharp, almost orangey flavor that makes it a great
match for many fruits. A sprinkle in ground coffee also does inter-
esting and tasty things for your morning cup.

Chapter 11: Sauces and Relishes for Dipping and Dashing 145
Bourbon Onion Chutney
A chutney is a condiment made from fruit and vegetables. Chutneys turn up
a lot in Indian cooking. Brandon Hamilton developed this chutney with
bourbon so that it goes especially well with grilled steak or pork chops.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: About 40 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 1⁄2 cups chopped yellow onion
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1⁄2 cup bourbon
2 tablespoons molasses
1⁄8 teaspoon ground allspice
1⁄2 cup water
2 1⁄2 ounces chopped dried apricots
1 In a heavy 12-inch skillet, combine the oil, onions, and mustard seeds, and
cook on medium heat until the onions begin to turn golden brown, about
15 minutes.
2 Deglaze the pan with the bourbon, and then add molasses, allspice, water,
and apricots.
3 Bring the chutney to a simmer and cook until thick, about 15 minutes.
When the mixture is thick, remove from heat, place into a plastic con-
tainer, and refrigerate.
Tip: Adding liquid to a pan after you’ve roasted meat (or, in this case,
caramelized onions) gives you a way to pick up the flavorful browned bits
from the pan and incorporate them into a sauce. Deglazing describes the
process, but all it really means is that you add liquid where you really didn’t
have any. Doing so ensures that you make use of all the flavor instead of leav-
ing behind what otherwise might cling to the pan.
Bourbon and barbecue have a long history together, maybe
because both issue from the southern United States, maybe
because bourbon, like smoked meat, takes on flavors from wood.
Bourbon isn’t bourbon unless it’s been aged for two years in a
white oak barrel.

Indian Tamarind Sauce
Used in India as a condiment for a range of dishes, this sauce, interpreted
here by Brandon Hamilton, has balanced flavors of tart and sweet that pair
well with spicy or sweet barbecue. The tartness of the tamarind goes well
with chicken, fish, and beef.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
11⁄4 cup cold water
6 tablespoons tamarind concentrate
(available at most Asian markets)
1 teaspoon ground mustard seeds
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne
1⁄2 teaspoon cardamom
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 Place the flour in a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons of the cold water
to make a smooth paste. Set aside.
2 In a small saucepot, combine remaining ingredients.
3 Place saucepot over medium heat and bring sauce to a simmer. Lower
heat and continue to cook for 10 minutes.
4 Mix 2 tablespoons of the sauce into the flour mixture and stir until flour
mixture is combine with sauce.
5 Now mix the flour mixture into the sauce in the saucepot. Stir until well
combined.
6 Continue to cook until the sauce stars to thicken, about 5 minutes.
Tip: If you want, you can strain the sauce before you use it to remove the seeds.
Taking an Exotic Turn with Sauces
That Cull Asian Flavors
Barbecue as we know it today has been around for about two cen-
turies, max. Cooks in Asia have been at it for thousands of years.
Safe to say, we could learn a thing or two from them, and in this
section, you find recipes that borrow flavors and methods from the
much-older cuisine.

Chinese Hoisin Barbecue Sauce
Brandon Hamilton developed this sauce to incorporate the Chinese hoisin
sauce into a wonderful barbecue sauce that works well with chicken,
seafood, pork, vegetables, and beef.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 1 cup
1⁄2 cup hoisin sauce
1⁄4 cup honey
2 tablespoons sherry
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 green onions, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except for the oil and mix
together gently with a whisk.
2 When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, add the oil and mix until
combined. This recipe stays good for 5 days in the refrigerator.
You should be able to find hoisin sauce in your supermarket, but if
you’re having trouble, try an Asian market, which will offer up sev-
eral choices.
The thick rust- or brown-colored sauce is made from soybeans,
garlic, vinegar, as well as seasonings and sweeteners that vary
from sauce to sauce. It’s a little bit sweet and has a flavor all its
own — a little salty, very strong, often spicy.
In China, hoisin is used on its own as a dipping sauce or as an
ingredient in other sauces.

Yield: About 2 cups
1 cup wasabi powder
1⁄2 cup water
11⁄2 tablespoons lemon juice
1⁄2 tablespoon salt
1 cup mayonnaise
1 In a mixing bowl, place the wasabi powder. Add the water and mix until it
forms a smooth paste.
2 Add the lemon juice and salt, and mix.
3 Add the mayonnaise, and stir until all ingredients are combined.

Peanut Dipping Sauce
A winner with a range of meats or with grilled vegetables, this peanut dip-
ping sauce from Grillmaster’s Garden works particularly well with chicken.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups
1⁄2 cup chunky peanut butter
1⁄4 cup lime juice
1⁄3 cup soy sauce
1⁄4 cup sesame oil
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1⁄4 teaspoon chile oil
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1⁄4 cup sliced green onions
1⁄2 cup water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 In a saucepan, combine peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, sesame oil,
sugar, red pepper flakes, chile oil, cilantro, and onions.
2 Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.
3 In a small bowl, mix water and cornstarch until well blended.
4 Add the water-cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and stir until the sauce
has thickened slightly.
5 Remove from heat and let cool in the refrigerator before serving.
Peanut butter becomes especially fragrant when you heat it. You
may want to open some windows or make the sauce a day before

Cool Summery Takes on Sauces,
Salsas, and Relishes
Fruits and vegetables are a clear partner for outdoor cooking,
given that both become more common in the summer. Chicken
sided with a ginger cucumber relish or grilled fish topped with
fresh fruit salsa make for memorable meals.

Guacamole Sauce
A great side for chicken or an excellent dip for snacking, this guacamole
sauce from Grillmaster’s Garden is mild and refreshing.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 2 1⁄2 cups
3 ripe avocados, pitted and scooped from
the skins (see instructions following this
recipe)
Juice of 1 lemon
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3⁄4 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon salt
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2 green onions, sliced thin
1 In a blender or food processor, combine the avocado, lemon juice, pepper,
yogurt, and salt.
2 Process until sauce becomes smooth.
3 Transfer to a bowl, and stir in the tomatoes and green onions.
Pitting an avocado is easier the riper the avocado, and you may be
able simply to scoop out the pit with a spoon. If not, use a chef’s
knife to twist out the pit. Follow these steps (and Figure 11-1):
1. Cut the avocado in half lengthwise.
2. Hold the half with the pit in your hand, peel-side down.
3. Swing the knife into the pit, using the weight of it and its
momentum to bury it down into the pit a third of the way
or so.
4. Twist out the pit.
5. Use a spoon to scoop out the fruit.
This section provides smart ways for using the bright flavors of
summer.

Ginger Tomato Relish
Brandon Hamilton’s relish recipe takes advantage of the bounty of tomatoes
that summer brings. The flavors are very crisp and clean and go well with
grilled meats, chicken, or fish. The relish also works all on its own as a salad.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None, but 30 minutes to chill
Yield: About 5 cups
1⁄4 cup apple rice vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar
3 teaspoons peeled and minced ginger
1⁄3 cup peanut oil
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
4 green onions, finely chopped
4 cups halved pear tomatoes
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, and ginger.
2 Gradually whisk in the oil.
3 Mix in the onions and green bell pepper.
4 Add the tomatoes to the relish base and toss to combine.
5 Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6 Place in a plastic container and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Chapter 11: Sauces and Relishes for Dipping and Dashing 153
Ginger Cucumber Relish
Relishes are served as an accompaniment for many different meat items in a
whole range of cultures. This one from Brandon Hamilton matches up with
grilled chicken, roasted duck, and grilled fish.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None, but estimate 1 hour to allow flavors to mingle and the
cucumbers to soften
Yield: About 31⁄2 cups relish
2 English cucumbers, peeled, halved,
seeded, cut crosswise into1⁄4-inch-thick
slices
2 teaspoons salt
1⁄2 cup rice vinegar
1⁄3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons minced peeled ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 In a mixing bowl, combine cucumbers with salt and gently toss.
2 In a separate bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar, ginger, cumin, and
cayenne pepper mix until the sugar is dissolved.
3 Mix the vinegar solution into the cucumbers and toss until combined.
4 Place into a plastic container and cover. Let the relish set for 1 hour.
English cucumbers are pretty close to seedless, so you can use
them as they come. If you substitute a standard slicing cucumber
(which in addition to seeds, has a thicker skin), you may want to
cut the cucumber in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with
a spoon. There’s no harm in eating the skins, but from a texture
standpoint, scraping off some of the peel doesn’t hurt.

Chilean Fruit Salsa
Grillmaster’s Garden offers this vibrant salsa and recommends serving it
atop grilled salmon.
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus 1 hour for chilling
Cooking time: None
Yield: About 3 cups
1 cup plums, diced (about 3 plums)
1 cup kiwi, diced (2 kiwis)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1⁄2 ripe avocado, diced
1⁄2 red onion, chopped
1⁄2 jalapeño, chopped
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients and mix.
2 Cover and let sit in refrigerator about 1 hour, to allow flavors to blend.

Smoky Black Beans
The smoked pepper powder and chipotle chilies give Paul Kirk’s black bean
dish a smoky overtone.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
1 small onion, minced
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 or 2 chipotle chilies (canned in adobo
sauce), minced
4 15-ounce cans black beans, drained
and rinsed
3⁄4 cup fresh orange juice
2 fresh tomatoes, skinned (see the
“Skinning tomatoes” sidebar), deseeded,
and chopped
1 teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked
habanero powder
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 In a 2-quart heavy stockpot, cook the onion in the oil over low heat, 
stirring until onion has softened.
2 Add chilies and continue cooking, stirring regularly, for 2 minutes.
3 Add beans, water to cover, and orange juice.
4 Mash lightly with a potato masher.
5 Add tomatoes and chipotle powder and simmer mixture for 15 minutes.
6 Season with salt and pepper.
Tip: If tomatoes are out of season or if you just want to make things a little
easier on yourself, substitute a 15-ounce can of diced tomatoes for the fresh
version. Throw in the whole can with all the tomato juices.

Santa Fe Pinto Beans
Paul Kirk’s take on beans tweaks the typical sweet baked variety with a
touch of chilies.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 10 servings
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
1 medium onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
141⁄2-ounce can chicken broth
1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
15-ounce can black beans, drained
15-ounce can pinto beans, drained
10-ounce can diced tomatoes with green
chilies, undrained
10-ounce package frozen corn, thawed
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 In 2-quart heavy stockpot, sauté green bell pepper, onion, and garlic in oil
for 3 minutes.
2 Stir in chicken broth and cumin.
3 Bring mixture to boil.
4 Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
5 Add beans, tomatoes, corn, and vinegar, and heat through, simmering
another 15 minutes.
Skinning tomatoes
Tomato skins can add a bitter flavor to recipes, which is why some call for the skins
to be removed — a feat that takes a little getting used to. To skin a tomato, follow
these steps:
1. Wash the tomato and remove its stem.
2. Scratch an X on the bottom of the tomato to give yourself a place to start 
peeling when the time comes.
3. Fill a medium mixing bowl halfway with ice and water. Set aside.
4. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
5. Drop the tomato into the boiling water.
6. Remove it with a slotted spoon as soon as you see the skin start to peel.

Baking Unique Sides in the
Smoker or on the Grill
Impress your friends and amaze your neighbors by baking biscuits
or making pizza outside in your smoker or on your grill. (Of course,
you also can make these recipes in the oven, if you’d rather, but it’s
not nearly as cool.)
Chapter 12: Something(s) to Serve with Your Barbecue 161
7. Place the tomato immediately into the ice bath.
8. Let the tomato cool in the ice bath for at least 5 minutes.
9. Pull the skin from the tomato, using a paring knife to nudge away any stubborn
bits from the tomato.
Iron Skillet Potato 
Bacon Biscuits
Cook up Paul Kirk’s savory biscuits in your grill or smoker.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: About 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (2 each)
1⁄3 cup butter
1 cup self-rising soft-wheat flour
1 cup potato flakes
1⁄2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
8 slices bacon, cooked crisp and
crumbled
3⁄4 cup buttermilk
1⁄4 cup melted butter
1 Grease a 9-inch iron skillet or baking pan with shortening.
2 Cut 1⁄3 cup butter into flour and potato flakes with a pastry knife until mix-
ture is crumbly.
3 Add cheese, bacon, and buttermilk.
4 Stir until dry ingredients are moistened.
5 Turn dough onto floured surface and lightly knead three or four times.
6 Roll or pat dough to 3⁄4-inch thickness.
7 Using 21⁄2-inch round cutter, cut out 12 biscuits and place in skillet.
8 Bake in smoker or grill (using indirect heat — see Chapter 2) at 425
degrees 12 to 14 minutes.

9 Brush tops with melted butter.
Tip: Baking these biscuits in an 425-degree oven works well, too.

Pizza Bread with Roasted Cherry 
Tomatoes and Crispy Prosciutto
Salty, crispy prosciutto gives this recipe, from Grillmaster’s Garden, a lot of
snap, but in a pinch, you can substitute plain old bacon.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
Dough:
1⁄2 cup hot water (115 to 120 degrees)
1 package active dry yeast
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon oil
1⁄2 tablespoon dried oregano
11⁄2 cups all-purpose flour
Toppings:
14 ounces cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
4 ounces prosciutto, chopped and fried
crispy
4-6 ounces fresh mozzarella
4 tablespoons fresh basil, chiffonade (see
Tip at end of recipe)
1 In a large bowl, mix the water, yeast, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt,1⁄2 teaspoon oil,
and oregano.
2 Let mixture stand 5 minutes.
3 Gradually add flour until dough pulls away from bowl.
4 Knead dough by hand for 5 minutes.
5 Brush a clean, large mixing bowl with olive oil.
6 Place kneaded dough into greased bowl and let rise 1 hour or until dough
has doubled in size.
7 While dough rises, preheat grill to 425 degrees.
8 Toss tomatoes with oil, salt, and pepper and place on baking sheet.
9 Bake on grill for 15 to 30 minutes, or until tomatoes have softened. Set
aside.
10 Remove dough from bowl and knead for 5 minutes.

11 Roll out dough to desired thickness (about 1⁄8 inch), dusting with flour as
necessary to keep dough from sticking. Transfer dough to an oiled piece of
foil.
12 Allow dough to rise for a few minutes.
13 Using a fork, poke several holes in pizza dough.
14 Top with 1 tablespoon olive oil, roasted tomatoes, prosciutto, and 
mozzarella.
15 Grill directly on grate at about 425 to 450 degrees for 4 to 7 minutes.
16 Remove from grill and top with fresh basil.
Tip: Chiffonade means “cut into shreds.” The easiest way to cut these very thin
strips of basil is to stack the leaves, roll them end to end, and slice strips from
the roll.

Super Spud Casserole
This decidedly rich and exceptionally simple potato casserole recipe comes
from Paul Kirk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
1⁄2 cup sharp grated cheddar cheese
1⁄2 cup grated mozzarella cheese
2 cans cream of potato soup
2-pound bag frozen hash browns
1 bell pepper, chopped
2 cups chopped ham or pulled pork
1 cup diced bacon
8 ounces sour cream

1 Combine cheeses and reserve 1⁄4 cup of mixture.
2 In a large bowl, mix soup, hash browns, bell pepper, ham or pork, bacon,
and sour cream.
3 Pour mixture into one 13-x-9-inch or larger glass dish.
4 Sprinkle remaining 1⁄4 cup of cheeses over top of casserole.
5 Bake on grill or in smoker or oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees.
In the United States, you most commonly see only a few varieties of
potatoes. In South and Central America (where potatoes originate),
cooks have dozens upon dozens of potato types to work with.
Potatoes have something in common with barbecue: They came
into prominence as a staple of the underprivileged. Potato plants
are extremely easy to grow and not terribly fussy about where you
plant them. They’re kind of like the tuber equivalent of pigs, which
eat anything and can handle most climates.

Shamrock Golden Tubers
The Smokin’ Irish BBQ Team points out that, in the motherland, potatoes are
called “tubers,” and they round out a barbecue on either side of the pond.
You can whip up these tubers on the smoker, on the grill, or in the oven.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 1 to 2 minutes
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Special equipment: Mandoline
8 ounces Irish cheddar cheese
(Kerrigans or Dubliner), shredded
3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
1 stick butter, divided into 16 pieces
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, sliced thin
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 Reserve 1⁄2 cup of the shredded cheese.
2 Spray a 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
3 Using a mandoline, slice potatoes to about1⁄8-inch thick.
4 Add one layer of potatoes to casserole dish.
5 Top with about one quarter of the garlic, onions, and cheese.
6 Add salt and pepper.
7 Repeat layers until you’ve used up all the potatoes, garlic, onions, and
butter (four pats of butter per layer), adding salt and pepper to each layer.
8 Layer remaining cheese over the top.
9 Cover with lid or aluminum foil and cook on smoker or grill for about 11⁄2
to 2 hours at 250 degrees, or in a 375-degree oven for about 45 minutes.
A mandoline is a hand-operated slicer that works magic by slicing
vegetables in any of several configurations. You can use it to get
uniform slices — thick or thin — or to julienne (cut into strips like
French fries) vegetables or even to dice onions.
You can find mandolines in a lot of variations (and in prices from
$20 to $120 or so) — made from wood, plastic, or stainless steel
and with varying degrees of adjustment — but they’re all long and
narrow, with a main blade and several attachment plates that you
use according to the kind of cuts you want to get. The suckers are
sharp, so you use a guide that comes with the mandoline to hang
onto vegetables while you slice them.

Swinetology Smoked Stuffed 
Jalapeño Peppers
The Church of Swinetology team warns that although these stuffed peppers
are addictive, making them is a little “like a game of Russian roulette” at
first. Until you get the hang of choosing jalapeños that meet the spice level
you can handle, you may end up with a few that run past your comfort zone.
What’s life if not lived on the edge, anyway?
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 60 to 90 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
12 large jalapeño peppers
1 package bread stuffing
1 cup Andouille sausage, chopped fine
8-ounce package mild or sharp shredded
cheddar
Barbecue sauce
1 While wearing rubber gloves, cut the stem ends off the peppers and
deseed them with a paring knife.
2 Wash peppers inside out, and let them dry.
3 Prepare bread stuffing according to package instructions.
4 In a medium skillet, cook the sausage over medium heat.
5 Drain sausage and set aside.
6 Put half of the stuffing into a bowl with the cheese and sausage and mix
thoroughly.
7 Push the stuffing mixture into peppers, and then top off each pepper with
bread stuffing at the open end.
8 Place peppers upright in grill pan (see Tip following this recipe).
9 Smoke peppers at 225 degrees until peppers are hot and soft, approxi-
mately 1 to 11⁄2 hours.
10 Serve with barbecue sauce.
Variation: Use pulled pork, bacon, breakfast sausage (or any other type of
sausage) in place of Andouille.

To make a grill pan, start with an aluminum vegetable pan (which
has holes on the bottom) or punch holes in an aluminum pan.
Stretch two layers of aluminum foil over the top of the pan and
crimp foil around the pan’s edges. Poke pencil-size holes in the foil 
2 inches apart and secure the peppers by forcing the bottom tips of
the peppers through the holes in the foil. Figure 12-1 shows you how.

Roasting peppers
When you roast a pepper, you blacken the skin. Even better, you bring out the sugars
and a unique, smoky flavor. It works best over a flame (simply hold it over the flame
with tongs until the skin blackens), but you can do it in a broiler, too.
Here’s how to roast a pepper:
1. Rub olive oil over the pepper.
2. Hold it over a flame or put it under the broiler, turning until all sides are blackened.
3. Put peppers in a paper bag and fold over the top.
4. Allow peppers to steam for 20 minutes.
5. Remove peppers from bag and scrape off blackened skin.
6. Cut peppers open and remove stem, seeds, and membranes.

Stuffed Peppers
Chef JJ of Grillmaster’s Garden started making these peppers as a healthier
alternative to fried jalapeño poppers but found that people tended to eat
twice as many of them, so that kind of threw out the health benefits he was
shooting for.
Preparation time: About 20 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 white onion, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 jalapeños, roasted (see the “Roasting
peppers” sidebar), seeded, and chopped
1⁄2 bell pepper, roasted (see the “Roasting
peppers” sidebar), seeded, and chopped
1⁄2 cup fresh cilantro, minced
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon ground cumin
16-ounce can Bush’s vegetarian baked
beans, drained but not rinsed
12 ounces shredded pepper jack cheese
Salt and pepper, to taste
5 mild peppers, such as poblano or
Anaheim
1 Preheat a grill set up for indirect cooking (see Chapter 2) to 400 degrees.
2 Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
3 Add olive oil, onions, garlic, jalapeños, and bell pepper.
4 Sauté mixture until onions have softened.
5 Lower heat and add cilantro, hot sauce, cumin, baked beans, and cheese.
6 Add salt and pepper.
7 Halve each of the five mild peppers and deseed them.
8 Brush lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
9 Fill each pepper half with bean mixture and set on a baking sheet.
10 Add wood chips to grill.
11 Grill peppers for 10 to 14 minutes, or until they’ve darkened and softened
slightly.
Note: If you prefer to make this recipe without leaving the house, use the
stovetop for steps 1 through 6, and then cook the peppers in a 400-degree
oven.

Mixing Salads, Making 
Memphis-Style Slaw
Slaw is an important part of barbecue, and this section includes a
recipe from one of the four barbecue regions. Pasta salad may not
have quite as long a history, but it has made it into the lineup at
pretty much every backyard party of the past several decades, so
it clearly has earned its spot at the table. This section also

Warm Apple Spinach Salad
Dr. Chuckie’s BBQ offers this award-winning recipe, which Dr. Chuckie him-
self says is the first thing to disappear at any potluck dinner that he brings
it to.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
4 slices bacon
1 small red onion, chopped fine
1 cup apple cider
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon salt
2 10-ounce bags of spinach
1 Cook the bacon slices and set aside.
2 Remove most of the bacon grease from the pan and then cook the onion
over medium heat until it’s barely tender, about 2 minutes.
3 Add the apple cider, cider vinegar, mustard, and salt.
4 Heat mixture through, but do not bring to boil.
5 Put the spinach in a large bowl.
6 Pour the warm vinaigrette over the spinach.
7 Crumble bacon over top.
Variation: After adding vinaigrette, try mixing in water chestnuts, feta cheese,
and/or raisins into the salad.

Memphis Slaw for Pulled Pork
Coleslaw can be a traditional side dish for barbecue in many regions, with
subtle variations in texture and twang. Tom Schneider, who runs Poppi-Q
BBQ and who contributed to this book, prefers a crispy version, not soggy or
finely chopped, with a little heat and sweet. He recommends trying it as part
of a pulled-pork sandwich with a little barbecue sauce drizzled over the top.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 10 to 12 servings (about 9 cups)
5 cups coarsely chopped green cabbage
3 cups coarsely chopped red cabbage
1⁄2 cup shredded carrots
11⁄2 cups salad dressing (Miracle Whip or
similar)
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon white pepper
3⁄4 teaspoon celery seeds
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 In a large bowl, lightly toss the cabbage and carrots.
2 In a separate medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and mix until
well distributed and smooth.
3 Refrigerate at least 2 hours until chilled.
4 Just before serving, pour over cabbage and carrot mixture while tossing
lightly. Serve as side or pulled pork sandwich topper.
Tom’s recipe calls for prepared horseradish, which you find in jars
in the condiment section of the grocery store. Horseradish starts
as a root and is then grated and mixed with distilled vinegar and in
many cases (depending on who’s making it) oil, and some salt and
a little sweetener.
Horseradish lends an intense and unmistakable flavor to whatever
you put it in. (Bloody Mary, anyone?) It doesn’t heat up until you
hurt it. Break it open or have at it with a grater, and its defense
system kicks in, releasing a strong irritant — the very thing that
provides the root’s heat when you use it in recipes. Distilled vine-
gar stabilizes the stuff, keeping it in top form for spicing up your
salads, dips, and such.

and Beyond
Rich, cheesy sides cozy up nicely to sharp, smoky barbecue fla-
vors, and this section provides some creative ways to test that
theory, as well as a real butt-kicker of a macaroni and cheese 
formula.

Parmesan-Stuffed Dates 
Wrapped with Bacon
Grillmaster Garden’s stuffed dates make a unique hors d’oeuvre that’s sweet
and savory.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings (2 each)
16 dates, pitted
8 slices bacon, cut in half
16 small pieces Parmesan or other hard
cheese
1 Set up grill for indirect cooking (see Chapter 2) and preheat to 400 degrees.
2 Place a small piece of cheese into each date.
3 Wrap1⁄2 slice bacon around each cheese-stuffed date.
4 Place prepared dates onto baking sheet.
5 Bake on grill for 12 to 15 minutes, or until bacon begins to crisp.
Variation: Finish the dates over direct heat for a more rustic effect. You can
also go in the other direction and bake the suckers in the oven.
Dates don’t have a long history with barbecue, given that they’re
grown primarily in the Middle East, but Paul Kirk is the Baron of
Barbecue, and that counts for something. A fruit of the date palm,
dates are eaten just as they are, dried, or made into vinegar, wine,
paste, or syrup. The flowers of the date palm are edible, and even
the leaves are cooked and eaten.

 Using your grill or smoker in nontraditional ways

U
sing the techniques in Chapter 4 and
the recipes in the earlier chapters,
you can pull together no end of great
meals. In this chapter, I give you some
inspiration for putting everything together.
Here, I give space to some of the dozens of
recipes that teams submitted for grilling.
(Even devout barbecue worshippers bust
out the grill on occasion, as you find in the
pages to come.) You also find here a recipe
for making a calzone in a smoker — who
knew? — and for bringing a brisket to a
tasty end right inside the house. Other
recipes give you further opportunity to use your barbecue skills in
ways traditional and not so.
Brisket: Out of the Smoker 
and into the Soup Pot
The very thing that makes brisket such excellent fodder for slow
smoking is the thing that makes it a good choice for soups and
stews, as well: its abundance of connective tissue.
Brisket comes from the chest area of the cow and includes the pec-
toralis muscle. Because it comes from such a hardworking area,
the muscle is well developed and tough, a condition that lends
itself not at all to the hot-and-fast methods of cooking like grilling.

Vegetable Brisket Soup
No reason to reserve brisket for the smoker. Doug Golden of JD’s Barbecue
Shoppe browns it up and throws it into vegetable soup, which is a great way
to take advantage of this tough cut.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: About 2 hours
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1 pound beef brisket, cut into small
pieces
4 cups beef broth
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cups water
1 141⁄2-ounce can crushed tomatoes
11⁄2 cups cubed potatoes
1 cup sliced carrots
1⁄2 cup corn
1 cup sliced celery
1 cup green beans
1⁄2 cup frozen peas
1⁄2 to 2 teaspoons herbs of your choice
(basil, oregano, or dill)
1 In heavy stockpot, brown beef over medium-high heat.
2 Add onions and cook for 3 minutes.
3 Add water, beef broth, and tomatoes and simmer until beef is tender,
about 90 minutes.
4 Add potatoes, carrots, corn, celery, and green beans, and cook until
tender, about 30 minutes.
5 Add peas and herbs, and simmer another 2 minutes.

A Little Something Fabulous 
for Cooking Fish
Fish lends itself well to the hot-and-fast cooking you get from
grilling, but with a caveat: Fish is much more delicate than pork,
chicken, beef, or lamb and requires a little more care to keep it
intact on the grill.
When you plan to cook fish on the grill, make sure you start with a
nice, clean grill grate. You may also want to give the grate a light
coating of oil before you cook your fish. Because most fish flakes,
getting it stuck to the grill can sink your project.

Sea Bass with Nectarine Salsa
Jon Carr from Grillmaster’s Garden uses a rich-tart marinade of coconut
milk, lime juice, and curry powder to start off this recipe with a bang.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
5 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon curry powder
4 pieces Chilean sea bass, 6 to 8 ounces
each
Kosher salt, to taste
2 cups cubed nectarines, in1⁄4-inch
pieces
3 tablespoons diced poblano peppers
1 tablespoon diced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon diced fresh mint
1 In a mixing bowl, combine coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of the lime juice,
and curry powder.
2 Season the sea bass with salt and place in the marinade, covering 
completely.
3 In a fresh mixing bowl, combine the nectarines, peppers, cilantro, and
mint with the remaining 4 tablespoons of lime juice.
4 Grill the sea bass over medium-hot coals, about 4 minutes per side, or
cook it in marinade in a 400-degree oven for 10 minutes.
5 Place cooked fish on plate and top with salsa.

Championship Chicken
Doug Spiller of Smoked Signals BBQ uses brine, a sweet rub, and an even
sweeter spray to cook chicken that doesn’t even need sauce.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Brining: 1 to 3 hours
Cooking time: About 2 hours
Yield: 8 servings
Brine
2 quarts water
2 quarts tangerine/grapefruit juice
1 cup sugar
3⁄4 cup salt
4 pounds chicken, either bone-in pieces
or a whole chicken
1 Combine ingredients in a Dutch oven or stockpot and heat, stirring, just
until the salt and sugar dissolve, about 5 minutes. Cool completely.
2 Place chicken in brine.
3 Let stand 1 to 11⁄2 hours for chicken parts, 2 to 3 hours for a whole bird.
Rub
1⁄2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1⁄4 cup salt
1⁄4 cup paprika
1 tablespoon dried celery leaves
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
1⁄2 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1⁄4 tablespoon garlic powder

1 In small bowl, combine all ingredients.
2 Pat onto chicken over and under the skin. Let rest 30 minutes.
Super Chicken Spray
Chapter 13: A Melange of Main Dishes 183
1⁄4 cup Triple Sec
1⁄4 cup apple juice
Combine ingredients in spray bottle.
Chicken
1 Place chicken in a 280-degree smoker.
2 Let cook for 1 hour, being careful not to use too much wood, because
chicken absorbs smoke quickly.
3 Raise temperature to about 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes to crisp the
skin and bring chicken to finishing temperature (about 180 degrees inter-
nally).
4 Spray chicken after it’s fully smoked.
Variation: Grill chicken after spraying to crisp the skin.
Putting triple sec to work in the kitchen
Triple sec is a liqueur that hails from France (where sec means dry) and tradition-
ally is flavored with orange peels. It provides orange flavor without a lot of extra
sweetness.
In case you’re buying a bottle just for this recipe (and it’s good enough that you
shouldn’t hesitate), here are further uses for the stuff:
 Mixing cocktails, of course: Use it in drinks like the margarita, cosmopolitan,
Long Island iced tea, and Mexican sunset.
 Flavoring fruit salad: Just mix triple sec with an equal part orange juice and
pour over any mix of fruit.
 Adding snap to French toast: Drop a couple tablespoons of triple sec into the
batter.
 Enlivening desserts: Add a tablespoon of triple sec to a cup of whipped cream
to add a crisp orange flavor and cut back the sweetness a smidge.

this step in an oven.)
5 Remove ribs from pan and finish directly on grill with the barbecue sauce
of your choice. (Check out Chapter 9 for ideas.)

Stink-Eye Pulled Pork
James Caldwell sells his Stink-Eye BBQ Sauce in several states. He’s not
giving up that recipe, but he is sharing his pulled pork rub, which of course
he shamelessly recommends serving with Stink-Eye BBQ Sauce.
Preparation time: 25 minutes plus 30 minutes cooling time
Cooking time: 7 to 9 hours (mostly in a slow cooker, unattended)
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
1⁄2 cup brown sugar, packed tightly
3 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
1⁄2 teaspoon thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
2 Stir or shake to mix. Use immediately or store in an airtight container.
Pulled Pork
1 pork shoulder, about 8 pounds
Stink-Eye BBQ Sauce, or other barbecue
sauce of your choice
1 Rub the pork shoulder with all the dry rub, on top and bottom of the
shoulder.
2 Place pork shoulder in a 5-quart or larger slow cooker on low heat. Add 
1⁄2 cup water in the bottom of the slow cooker to prevent burning.
3 Cover and cook 6 to 8 hours.
4 Check meat temperature every hour thereafter until it reaches 170 degrees.
5 Remove from slow cooker.
6 Place in a roasting pan in a preheated 500-degree oven. If you can pull 
out the ceramic insert from your slow cooker, skip the roasting pan and
put the insert onto a cookie sheet and place both in the oven.
7 Cook 15 minutes.
8 Remove meat from oven and let rest 30 minutes.
9 Pull meat apart with forks.
10 Serve with Stink-Eye BBQ Sauce or other barbecue sauce of your choice.

Have Pizza Stone, Will 
Smoke Calzone
Barbecue competitions usually include an “anything but” category
wherein teams vie for bragging rights over dishes that don’t fit into
the main judging categories — ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, and
chicken. The calzone (a filled pizza crust shaped more or less into a
turnover) in this chapter is a dish that qualified as “anything but.”

Grilled Calzone
The Smokin’ T’s team says this recipe is further evidence that you shouldn’t
stop shopping for things to cook on the grill at the meat aisle — bread, 
vegetables, pizza, fruit, and so on are fair game.
Preparation time: 45 minutes (includes rising time)
Cooking time: 30 hours
Yield: 2 large calzones, about 6 to 8 servings
Special equipment: Pizza stone
Calzone Dough
1 cup warm water
1 package active dry yeast
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
21⁄2 cups flour
1 Combine water and yeast in a bowl.
2 Let mixture rest for 5 minutes.
3 Stir oil, salt, and 11⁄2 cups of the flour into water-yeast mixture.
4 Add remaining flour, kneading until dough is smooth, not sticky.
5 Remove dough and place in a lightly greased bowl.
6 Let dough rise for an hour or until it has doubled in size.
7 Punch dough down and divide it into two portions.
8 Cover dough and let rest 20 minutes.

Calzone Filling
Chapter 13: A Melange of Main Dishes 187
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound Italian sausage, loose or without
casing
1⁄2 cup chopped onion
1⁄2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 cup cubed or shredded mozzarella
1⁄2 cup grated Parmesan or Romano
cheese
2 teaspoon chopped fresh sage (or 3⁄4
teaspoon dried)
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1 large egg
1 Preheat smoker or grill (using indirect heat — see Chapter 2) to 450 to 
500 degrees, and set a pizza stone on the grate.
2 Heat oil in skillet at medium-high heat and brown the sausage. Set aside.
3 Using the skillet you cooked the sausage in, sauté the onion and green
bell pepper for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
4 Press each dough ball into a 12-inch circle on a piece of parchment paper
or foil.
5 Combine cheeses, sage, black pepper, and egg in a large bowl.
6 Add sausage, green bell pepper, and onion, and mix well.
7 Place half of the filling onto one side of each dough circle.
8 Fold dough over to make a half-circle, and crimp the edges to seal.
9 Using a fork, poke several holes in each calzone.
10 Slide the calzones onto a pizza stone, making sure no edges hang over the
edge of the stone, which would cause the crust to burn.
11 Cook 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove carefully.
Tip: If you prefer smaller serving sizes, you can divide the dough into three 
or four portions rather than just two, and press them into smaller circles
accordingly.
Stylish Recipes for Lamb and Beef
Throwing burgers or steaks onto the grill is an experience most
people have had and a starting point for even timid outdoor cooks.
In this section, you find still-simple recipes that go at least a step
beyond the “meat on grill” formula, making use of rubs and 
marinades.

Lamb usually isn’t marbled as heavily as beef is, so what you want
to look for when you buy lamb chops is a layer of smooth, white fat
around the edge. Mutton is the name for meat from older sheep and
has a much stronger, gamier flavor (probably the one that people
who say they don’t like lamb associate with the stuff) than the
meat from young lambs.

Beef Tenderloin with Cascabel 
Chile Aioli Marinade
A Cascabel chile is a small, globe-shaped number that packs a tangy, low to
medium-hot punch. Paul Kirk adds Cascabels to a light-flavored, refreshing
aioli.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
3 1⁄2 pounds beef tenderloin, trimmed
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
1 Cascabel chile, stemmed, seeded, and
cut into large pieces
3⁄4 cup mayonnaise
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 shallot, minced
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
1⁄4 teaspoon paprika
1⁄4 teaspoon ancho chile powder
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2 Place roasting pan on stove and heat oil over medium-high heat.
3 Pat tenderloin with paper towels.
4 Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.
5 Place in roasting pan with oil and roast in oven (or in a hot, covered grill).
6 While meat cooks, toast Cascabel chile in a small skillet over high heat,
turning pieces once, until blistered and fragrant.
7 Let cool until brittle. 
8 Using a mortar and pestle, pound chile into a powder.
9 Mix powder in medium bowl with remaining ingredients to create the
aioli.
10 Remove meat from oven or grill after 25 to 30 minutes, or when internal
temperature is in the 130- to 150-degree range. Because you’re using such
a hot oven, you may want to check the internal temperature of the meat
as the 25-minute mark approaches to make sure you don’t overcook it.
11 Let rest 10 to 15 minutes
12 Slice and serve with aioli on the side.

Korean Beef Barbecue 
(Bulgogi)
Brandon Hamilton offers this recipe, which gives you a super-simple way to
grill beef that produces a striking result.
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus marinating time
Cooking time: About 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2-pound top sirloin steak, trimmed
2 tablespoons molasses
6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
11⁄2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 Clean the excess fat from the beef and slice diagonally against the grain
into 2-inch-thick slices.
2 In a resealable plastic bag, combine all ingredients. Seal the bag securely,
making sure to remove the excess air from the bag.
3 Marinate the beef in the refrigerator 1 to 2 hours, rotating the bag occa-
sionally to ensure that all the beef is covered in marinade.
4 Preheat the grill to 350 degrees.
5 Gently remove the beef from the marinade and transfer directly to the
grill. Make sure to place the slices of beef against the grain of the grill
grate.
6 Grill the beef for approximately 5 minutes (about 2 minutes per side) or
until desired doneness.
Traditionally, the meat for bulgogi is sliced almost paper thin,
which is no mean feat unless you have a meat slicer. Keeping the
slices thicker also enables you to cook it on the grill, adding an
extra layer of flavor.
Bulgogi often is served in lettuce leaves, but it tastes great with
rice, too.

Spudzilla
The brains behind Spudzilla run TC’s Memphis BBQ, a restaurant where
Spudzillas fly out of the kitchen doors or, given their ample girth, are more
likely wheeled out. The finished product weighs somewhere between 3 and
4 pounds, hence the name. Diners at TC’s earn a T-shirt if they conquer a
Spudzilla in one sitting. More reasonable folk could slice it into portions 
(a good four of them, no doubt) or start with smaller spuds.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 to 4 servings
1 large baked potato (1 to 1 1⁄2 pounds) or
2 or 3 smaller potatoes to equal 1 1⁄2
pounds
1⁄4 cup butter
1⁄4 cup sour cream
1 cup nacho cheese
1 cup barbecued pork
1⁄2 cup baked beans
1⁄3 cup diced tomatoes
1⁄3 cup diced onion
1⁄4 cup canned sliced jalapeños
1 Place baked potato on a plate, cut it lengthwise and crosswise, and then
mash it lightly with a fork.
2 Spread the butter and sour cream over the potato.
3 Top with nacho cheese.
4 Add warmed barbecued pork.
5 Spoon baked beans over the pork on a diagonal.
6 Finish the spud with tomatoes, onion, and jalapeños.
Tip: If you don’t want to bust out the smoker, you can accomplish roughly the
same results by cooking the dish in a large Dutch oven. Add 1⁄2 teaspoon of
liquid smoke (see Chapter 8) if you want to make sure you get the smoke
flavor. It also works just fine if you cook it in a slow cooker for 6 to 8 hours.

Baking the perfect potato
Some people swear by baking their spuds in a microwave, but those are probably
the same people who think instant coffee is a great notion. To bake a nice potato —
one that’s soft inside and has a crispy skin, you need time and an oven. Here’s how:
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
2. Scrub your spuds and stab them a couple times on each side with a fork.
3. Brush the potatoes with olive or vegetable oil.
4. Place them right on the rack, with a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch
the drippings.
5. Take them out of the oven when the skin looks browned and crinkly, and the
potatoes feel soft if you squeeze them.
For a potato as big as the one you want for Spudzilla, that means a good 
90 minutes of baking.
Barbecue Hash
More than a fine use for leftover barbecue, Paul Kirk’s barbecue hash is
comfort in a casserole pan.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
2 cups cold barbecue brisket or pulled
pork
1 cup cold cooked potatoes, diced
1⁄2 cup diced onions
1⁄3 cup diced green bell pepper
1 cup canned or leftover gravy
Salt and pepper, to taste
1⁄4 cup breadcrumbs
1⁄4 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon butter
Paprika, to taste
1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2 Butter a 2-quart casserole pan.
3 Combine brisket or pork, potatoes, onions, bell pepper, gravy, salt, and
pepper.
4 Place in buttered casserole pan.
5 Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and cheese.

6 Dot with butter, and sprinkle with paprika.
7 Bake until cheese is melted and casserole is warm throughout, about 30
minutes.

Jalapeño Shot Shells
The Smoke Hunters team makes use of its leftover brisket with this crowd-
pleasing snack or side dish.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 large jalapeño peppers
1⁄2 cup cream cheese
1⁄4 cup Smoke Hunters’ BBQ Rub (see
Chapter 6)
1⁄2 cup leftover brisket
1⁄2 pound thick-cut bacon
1 Slice peppers in half and clean out membrane and seeds.
2 Fill each with a small scoop of cream cheese.
3 Dust cream cheese with rub.
4 Pile on a forkful of cooked shredded brisket.
5 Wrap each with a half piece of bacon, and hold together with a toothpick.
6 Place peppers on a smoker or grill until outside of pepper is roasted.
Tip: You can get similar results without fighting the melty cream cheese by
baking this dish in a 350-degree oven for about 30 minutes.

Culture Combos: Using Barbecue
Leftovers in Unexpected Ways
Apple pie didn’t get its start in America, no matter what well-worn
similes may tell you. Apple pie got its start in Europe. Barbecue, on
the other hand, may well be the only form of distinctly American
cuisine.
If the recipes that follow are any indication, that means its ripe for
combining with a little something from elsewhere.

The jalapeño gamble
Can you tell how hot a pepper is going to be just by looking? Depends on who you
ask. So many factors go into a pepper’s heat level (which is based on how much
capsaicin it contains), that there really is no easy way to figure out just by looking
or touching how hot a pepper is going to taste.
The capsaicin comes from the placenta, the middle, white material inside a pepper
that holds the seeds. Capsaicin may leak into the seeds, but it doesn’t originate in
them, as many people think. If you taste a pepper and find it has more punch than
you care for, scrape away more of the pithy inner tissue, and you scrape away much
of the heat.
It may be an urban legend, but some people insist that you can determine how hot
a jalapeño is going to be by its shape. Rounder is milder, the lore has it, so pick a
pointy-ended jalapeño if you’re looking for the burn.
Big R’s Smoked BBQ Spaghetti
This recipe from the Smoke Hunters team uses hot links, a kind of spicy
sausage that’s a staple in Texas barbecue.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
1-pound box spaghetti
1⁄4 cup Smoke Hunters’ BBQ Rub (see

4 smoked hot links, cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick
slices
1⁄2 pound smoked pork butt
1 cup barbecue sauce

1 Cook spaghetti according to package instructions.
2 Place cooked spaghetti in medium foil pan.
3 Dust with Smoke Hunters’ BBQ Rub.
4 Add hot links, smoked pork, and barbecue sauce.
5 Place pan in a 225-degree barbecue pit for 20 minutes.

BBQ Fried Rice
Dan Cannon, the cook behind BBQ by Dan (www.bbqbydan.com) uses this
recipe for leftover barbecue meat of any form or combination.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 5 to 6 servings
2 cups uncooked rice (this makes 
4 1⁄2 cups cooked rice)
3 eggs
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄2 cup diced onion
1 cup barbecue meats (your choice:
brisket, butt, chicken, pork, or rib meat, or
a combination thereof)
1⁄2 cup shredded smoked brisket
2 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup soy sauce
1 cup frozen peas and carrots
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 Cook rice according to package instructions.
2 In a small pan, scramble eggs over medium heat. Set aside. 
3 In an oversized cast iron fry pan, melt butter over medium heat.
4 Add onions and cook until translucent.
5 Add all barbecue meat and cook until almost browned.
6 Add 1⁄4 cup vegetable oil.
7 Spoon in rice, while stirring, until you’ve blended all of it into the butter,
onions, and meat.
8 Continue to stir, and add additional 1⁄4 cup oil if you need it.

9 Stir in 1⁄4 cup soy sauce and stir until all the rice becomes brown.
10 Add another 1⁄4 cup soy sauce to bring mixture to desired texture, color,
and taste.
11 Stir in peas, carrots, and eggs, and mix thoroughly.
12 Continue stirring until vegetables are heated through.
13 Add salt and pepper to taste.
Variation: For a drier rice that works particularly well with this recipe, Dan
recommends parboiling the rice, which means boiling it only partway before
adding it to the recipe. To parboil, simply cook the rice for about 3/4 of the
time that the package instructions call for, rinse it in cold water, and then drain
it. It’ll cook further as you mix it with the other ingredients in the pan, eventu-
ally coming to the same degree of doneness that it would have through boiling
and without going past its ideal, firm state.

 Running down popular pitfalls
 Outlining fixes that aren’t
 Benefiting from others’ mistakes
You will make mistakes as you find your footing in barbecue
cooking. If you don’t, you’re probably not trying anything new.
Mistakes are part of the adventure, but they aren’t so much the
tasty part.
In this chapter, I direct you away from ten mistakes that many
people before you have made. The advice in this chapter comes
from centuries of other people figuring out the hard way, and it
frees you up to walk a smoother path to delicious barbecue, as
well as to invent some new mistakes all your own.
Being in an All-Fired Hurry
If you want fast, cook a grilled cheese. If you want barbecue, chill
out. Slow is the essence of barbecue. Cooking at low temperatures
for a goodly amount of time is what makes barbecue barbecue and
makes the meat melt in your mouth. Before you cook, put some
thought into how much time you’re going to need, how you want to
season or sauce your product, and the sides you want to serve
with it. Planning ahead makes you less likely to get distracted
when your meat needs you most.
The prep work you do before you even get the meat near the heat
keeps it tender and gives it your unique touch of flavor. Why rush
past the prep or try to hurry the cooking? Savor the process as
you will savor the product.

Sprinting Past Your 
Experience Level
Barbecue creates converts faster than the smoothest-talking tele-
vangelist, but you’re better off letting your enthusiasm simmer
before you take on intense barbecue projects for a party of friends
and family. You may be eager to show off your new bullet smoker,
but don’t let your mouth make promises your barbecue can’t keep.
Barbecue comes with a lot of variables, and although most of what
you do will become second nature after you get the swing of
things, you have a lot to keep track of in the beginning. Better to
take it slow, making subtle changes in your recipes or processes,
than to rush ahead and bring frustration to your table.
Using Wood Before Its Time
When you cook over wood, the flavor of the smoke that rises from
the chips or chunks of hickory or oak or whatever seeps its way
through your meat. Given the cooking time you’re investing, that’s
a lot of flavor, so it’d better be a good one. Using wood that hasn’t
been aged properly is a sure way to throw off your flavor, and in
some cases the texture of your meat — some green woods blacken
meat, and that’s because creosote is abundant in fresh wood (and
light in aged wood).
Freshly cut wood has a lot of moisture, which means a lot of
smoke — and oversmoking overpowers the natural flavor of the
meat and can make it taste bitter.
Because the wood chips or chunks provide a flavor source rather
than a heat source, you don’t want to burn them. A solid soak in
cool water keeps them moist enough that they slowly release
smoke. Shoot for half an hour to an hour of soaking time.
Taking Meat from Fridge to Fire
Temperature being one of the gods of great barbecue, you want to
keep a handle on the temperature of your meat as well as that of
your smoker. Putting meat onto the grate right from the refrigera-
tor adds a lot of cold air to your smoker, and that’s likely to lead to
condensation of creosote from the charcoal. The creosote floats up
via the smoke and onto your meat, adding a flavor and texture
that’s probably not what you’re after.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
204

Let your meat sit at room temperature for about an hour before
you cook it. Most recipes count on your doing so and advise
cooking times that are based on the meat starting at about room
temperature.
Letting meat rest at room temperature for more than an hour is a
bad idea. When it gets too warm, it also becomes susceptible to
bacteria.
Lighting Charcoal with 
Lighter Fluid
If you drink naphtha for breakfast and chase it with benzene, by all
means, coat your charcoal with lighter fluid before you light it.
You’ll enjoy the acrid tang the flammables impart to your brisket. If
you’d rather taste the sweetness of the apple wood you smoked it
over and the bite of your rub, skip the lighter fluid and use a chim-
ney starter instead. You can find them at just about any hardware
store, and they enable you to skip the lighter fluid. All you need is
the charcoal, some paper, and a match. I tell you about using a
chimney starter in Chapter 2.
A chimney starter comes in handy when you want to add more
charcoal to increase the heat in your smoker. Get the charcoals
going first in the chimney instead of throwing them in cold. Doing
so gives you better control over your heat and lets any odors in
the briquettes burn off before they have a chance to waft up into
your meat.
Overcorrecting, Overzealously
A steady temperature is kindest to your meat, meaning it’ll be kind-
est to your tongue when all’s said and done. Fluctuating tempera-
tures make for uneven cooking and can dry out your meat. Adding
heat is always easier than reducing it, so start conservatively,
erring on the side of too little charcoal and slowly adding more bri-
quettes as you need them.
Keep your eye on the temperature with a good thermometer, and
keep the lid on your smoker as much as possible. Peeking in is
tempting, but it’s the enemy of a steady temperature.
Chapter 15: Ten Ways Rookies Ruin Good Meat 205

Load up the grate with meat, and you may think the answer is to
add more heat to cook it. Stop right there. More heat is just going
to dry out your product and may even burn it. Instead, remove
some of the meat to allow air to flow throughout the unit and keep
the temperature steady throughout the smoker.
Getting Sauced Early
Sugar has low heat tolerance. So do tomatoes. These two mainstays
of barbecue sauces are the very things that give your chicken a
black, crackling coating if you try to cook with them. The chicken
(or any other meat) takes longer to cook than does the sauce,
which burns right around it. Wait until you’re almost finished cook-
ing before you add a sweet sauce with tomatoes. A minute or two
on each side of the meat over a low to moderate flame is all the
time the sauce needs to add taste and texture.
If you prefer to baste the meat while it cooks, use a sauce with a
low sugar content or one that you’ve thinned with water or
vinegar.
Relying on Eyes, Not Numbers
Your eyes may deceive you when it comes to figuring out whether
your meat is cooked. This is particularly true when you smoke
meat because smoked chicken and pork tend to pink as they cook
instead of taking on the white color that reassures cooks and
eaters that the meat has been thoroughly cooked.
Find meat’s internal temperature to determine whether it’s ready
for sampling. Chapter 4 gives you a rundown of the internal tem-
peratures you want to reach for different cuts of meat.
Poking Holes into the Meat
You want to keep the precious juices inside the meat, so use tongs
anytime you move it. Stab it and you provide a sure route for the
juices to ooze out, taking with them any hope you had for great
barbecue.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
206

Forgetting Rest Time
The hours of preparation behind you, the cooking complete at long
last, pulling apart your pork shoulder is quite a temptation. Do so
too soon, and you throw out all your hard work in an instant.
Meat’s juices go where the heat is lowest, so give them a chance at
your cutting board, and they run for it. If, instead, you let the meat
rest after you take it off the heat, the juices have a chance to be
reabsorbed by the proteins that set them free in the first place. Cut
into a well-rested piece of meat, and you find tender juiciness
rather than a puddle around your desiccated pork chop. Chapter 4
gives you the specifics about letting meat rest.

B
arbecue became a sport for good reason, and part of that is
because barbecue cooks tend toward the competitive and
opinionated. Each recipe and each fine-tuning of this or that cook-
ing technique is held by someone to be the critical element of his
or her barbecue success.
In this chapter, I give you ten points about barbecue that everyone
can agree on.
The Truth Is in the Cook, 
Not the Equipment
You find advantages to higher-end smokers, the ones that keep a
steady temperature as long as you need them to and do everything
but give you a backrub while your pork shoulder cooks. But do you
need them? Nah.
Just consider the origins of barbecue: The culinary tradition that
we now call hobby and follow as sport started out of necessity,
with people who had very little in the way of resources. They
cooked the worst cuts of meat in holes they dug in the ground, and
in doing so, they stumbled onto some great science and created an
enduring cuisine.

True enough — top-of-the-line equipment makes cooking easier.
But at its heart, barbecue is a way to get around the need for
expensive paraphernalia. And although new, shiny, technically
enhanced cookers are tempting and marketers will assure you that
they’re even necessary, all you need is almost nothing.
Cook Low and Slow
What went down in underprivileged, rural areas — by necessity
and by trial and error — has some hard science behind it. When
you cook meat slowly, over low heat, hydrolysis occurs.
Hydrolysis means that the tight collagen fibers in the tendons are
interrupted by molecules of water from the moist heat and from
elsewhere in the muscle tissue. The tough collagen becomes soft
gelatin, and the meat becomes tender. Voilà!
Hydrolysis takes place only at relatively low cooking temperatures.
You don’t get the same reaction when you sear meat on a grill or
griddle.
If You’re Lookin’, You’re 
Not Cookin’
Playwright Oscar Wilde said he could resist anything but tempta-
tion, and for most rookie barbecue cooks, the temptation to take
just a peek at what’s going on inside the smoker is too much to
resist.
Resist. For the love of brisket, resist.
When you open your smoker to eyeball your meat, you gain noth-
ing but the satisfaction of knowing that a very unlikely rib robbery
hasn’t taken place in your backyard. Plus, you harm what’s there.
Maintaining a steady temperature throughout the smoker is the
best way to produce evenly cooked, tender meat. Open the smoker
and you throw the temperature balance out of whack, create hot
and cool spots, and usually lose several degrees along the way. You
abuse your good ingredients and all the care you’ve put into the
product. And for what? Everything you need to know is in the tem-
perature and the timing.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
210

There Is Such a Thing 
as Oversmoking
The smoke that wafts up from whatever wood you use in your
smoker cushions the meat you cook from the direct heat of the
charcoal below and infuses it with subtle flavors. It’s a big part of
what makes barbecue barbecue, but too much of it makes barbe-
cue inedible.
You can get a bitter smoke flavor from using too much wood in
your cooker. The surest way to avoid that is to add small amounts
of wood to the smoker over a long period of time rather than a
whole heap at the start. And if it’s heat you’re looking for, make
sure that you add charcoal instead of wood.
Sauce on the Side, Nothing to Hide
Although many barbecue eaters (and even some cooks) equate the
whole of barbecue with the sauce, ideally even the best sauce
serves only to complement well-prepared meat.
Any barbecue meat that has been adeptly prepared and cooked
stands without a lick of sauce. On the flip side of that, sauce is like
a barbecue muumuu, something bold and big used to hide what
the cook doesn’t want you to see — overcooked or oversmoked
meat, a flavorless preparation, or a past-its-prime cut.
Sauce is a great part of the barbecue equation and a great way to
experiment, but it’s not the be-all and end-all. You have to have a
foundation of great meat before you can boast your barbecue
prowess.
Hot Dogs and Hamburgers 
Are Not Barbecue
Not that there’s anything wrong with hot dogs and hamburgers.
Just please don’t confuse them with barbecue. Barbecue takes
place slowly, over low heat in a closed cooking apparatus with
smoke from aged wood.
Chapter 16: Ten Truer Words Were Never Spoken 211

Grilling is what you do with steaks or weenies. It involves high heat
and quick cooking. It’s good stuff, but it isn’t barbecue. When you
grill, you typically use different cuts of meat and cook them by a
completely different technique. The only similarity, really, is that
you cook by either method outdoors. Oh, and you use charcoal
either way.
Refer to grilling as “barbecuing,” and you’re going to raise hackles
in a hurry.
Time Is on Your Side
Never has patience been so beautifully rewarded as when you sink
your teeth into a perfect pulled-pork sandwich that you babied
from rub to rest time.
Timing your barbecue project is critical for getting the result you
want. Make sure you allow plenty of time for preparation and cook-
ing, and keep notes of your cooking exploits so that you can best
narrow down the cook times that give you the best end product.
Meat That Falls Off the Bone Has
Been Cooked Too Long
Fall-off-the-bone tender usually is used as a term of endearment
when applied to barbecued ribs, but meat that literally falls from
the bone is overcooked.
What you want to shoot for is meat that pulls cleanly from the
bone. You want to “bite ’em, not fight ’em,” and the bite part of that
equation means you don’t want the ribs to be something you don’t
need teeth for. Texture is an important part of the deal when it
comes to ribs.
Watch for meat that shrinks away from the ends of the bones
(about 1⁄4 inch to 1⁄2 inch at the most). That’s a good indication that
it’s ready to come away from the heat.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
212

Cleanliness Is Next to Tastiness
Buildup on your cooking grate can impart some unwelcome flavors
on your barbecue meats. And a grunged-up grate is sticky — it’ll
grab whatever you’re cooking and hold it, meaning you leave food
on the grate or pick up remnants from the chicken you cooked
three weeks ago.
Clean your grate with a wire brush after you’ve heated it up but
before you put anything on it, and clean it again after you’re done
cooking. Have at it while you let your meat rest. (Turn to Chapter 4
to find out about meat’s much-needed rest after cooking.)
Fat Is Flavor
This is a hard one to drive home, given the current nutritional cli-
mate, in which fat has become such a villain that it practically
wears a black cape and twirls a handlebar moustache.
Quite simply: Fat is flavor, especially when it comes to barbecue
cooking, which relies on the slow breakdown of fat to add moisture
and tang to whatever you’re cooking.
Fat serves as storage, and that means that the flavors of the
animal’s diet stick around in the fat cells. As I tell you in Chapter 5,
smell has more to do with taste than anything that happens on
your tongue, and fat holds most of the aroma-producing molecules,
meaning that it lets loose a lot of good scents that you read as
taste.
Look for meat that has heavy, even marbling to get the most flavor
out of your barbecue cooking. Don’t be afraid to apply rub to the
fat on the meat — it’ll infuse that flavor, too.

to pick the brains of experienced barbecue cooks is the main
reason for visiting The Barbeque Forum, but you find many more:
links to podcasts, classifieds where you can unload or purchase
equipment, and a blog co-written sporadically by a number of con-
tributors.
Barbecue’n on the Internet
Easy to navigate and full of advice for the beginner, Barbecue’n on
the Internet (www.barbecuen.com) contains article after article,
many of them on an “According to Smoky” page that features seem-
ingly unlimited wisdom from C. Clark “Smoky” Hale, a barbecue
authority of long standing and the author of The Great American
Barbecue & Grilling Manual (Abacus Publishing).
Sections on equipment, charcoal, and spices — and a complete
beginners’ guide — set the site apart. Information on the site goes
deep. You even find a section devoted to articles about spices,
wherein expert Ann Wilder covers the nuances among sugars and
the uses for Szechuan peppers, among other things.
An enormous recipe collection will keep you cooking for the fore-
seeable future; the site’s barbecue store connects you to every-
thing you need to cook in the first place.
Further Regional Barbecue
Associations
If you’re looking for a closer-to-home congregation of barbecue
enthusiasts, chances are good you have a barbecue association in
your neighborhood, if not your backyard. Barbecue cooking has
infiltrated even areas known more for clam chowder than smoked
brisket, and as its popularity grows, so does the number of organi-
zations dedicated to spreading the gospel.
Here are a few of the well-established organizations, from one end
of the United States to the other:
 Arizona BBQ Association (www.azbbqa.com)
 California Barbecue Association (www.cbbqa.org)
Part V: The Part of Tens

 Central Texas Barbecue Association (www.ctbbqa.org)
 Greater Omaha Barbecue Society (www.gobs.org)
 Florida Barbecue Association (www.flbbq.org)
 Illinois BBQ Society (www.ilbbqs.com)
 Iowa Barbeque Society (www.iabbq.org)

Ten World-Famous 
Barbecue Events
In This Chapter
 Gathering for barbecue and festivity
 Peering into the competition circuit
 Mixing and mingling with fellow enthusiasts
G
iven the braggadocio that’s been part and parcel of barbecue
cooking maybe as long as hogs have been thrown into pits,
barbecue cooking becoming sport was inevitable. Each year brings
hundreds of competitions for cooks of every level, and those com-
petitions offer the chance not just to sample great eats but to share
information, maybe take some classes, and usually groove to live
music.
Not every festival has a competitive element, and in this list you
find a couple events that are purely for celebration of America’s
greatest culinary contribution.
Jack Daniel’s World Championship
Invitational Barbecue
The biggest of the bigs: The Jack Daniel’s World Championship
Invitational Barbecue is the premier barbecue cooking event.
Nobody makes it into the competition without beating out at least
50 other teams in a barbecue competition, or 2 dozen other teams
in a designated state championship competition. While the elite
teams sweat out the competition, visitors whoop it up at the sur-
rounding festival.

The competition takes place over two days each fall at the Jack
Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Bonus: Visitors can tour
the distillery during the competition.
For more information, go to www.jackdaniels.com.
Memphis in May World
Championship
One full mile of barbecue competition, vending, music, and more:
The Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking
Contest is three days of springtime merriment — and pulled
pork — that takes place in downtown Memphis, right on the bank
of the Mississippi River and next to Beale Street. If you can’t have
fun amid all that, you’re just not trying.
A People’s Choice contest gives visitors a taste — yeah, I went
there — of competition judging, and the Cooker’s Caravan gives
visitors behind-the-scenes looks at competition cooking and a
chance to beg tips from the contestants.
For more information, go to http://memphisinmay.org/
wcbcc_visitor.htm.
National BBQ Festival
Drawing winners from barbecue contests of all stripes for its Best
of the Best Invitational, the National BBQ Festival annually turns
Douglas, Georgia, into barbecue central.
In addition to the Best of the Best competition, cook-offs in several
other categories are open and award prizes for backyard cooks,
kids, and masters of sweet potato pie.
Food vendors, an antiques auction, music, and “south Georgia’s
largest indoor yard sale” round out the two-day event, which takes
place mid-fall each year.
For more information, go to www.nationalbbqfestival.com.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
222

American Royal Barbecue
Part of the century (and then some)–old American Royal cattle
exposition, horse show, and rodeo, American Royal Barbecue
draws 500 competitors to its invitational and its open competition.
“Barbecuelooza” brings a Texas Hold’em tournament, a profes-
sional rodeo event, a concert series, and all manner of barbecue
goodness available for the eating.
Drawing 70,000 visitors, the American Royal Barbecue started in
1980 and now bills itself as the biggest barbecue competition in the
world. It happens each year during the fall in Kansas City, Kansas.
For more information, go to www.americanroyal.com.
Big Pig Jig
Originally a whole-hog cooking contest, the Big Pig Jig has grown in
every way and now includes categories for Brunswick stew, ribs,
sauce, and so on. The festival draws crowds of more than 20,000.
An annual event that takes place in the early fall in Vienna, Georgia,
the Big Pig Jig is held in conjunction with a major arts-and-crafts
fair and the local livestock association’s annual hog show.
Festival events take place over the span of a week, starting with a
quiz bowl and wrapping up with a concert. In between are a golf
tournament, a 5K run, a hog calling contest, and food, of course.
For more information, go to www.bigpigjig.com.
Big Apple Barbecue Block Party
Two summer days of food and music hit New York’s Madison
Square Park for the first time in 2003, and the event took hold right
away. Several big muckety-mucks of barbecue come in from all
over the country to show off their skills. Big-time food gurus lead
seminars on all things barbecue.
And then there’s the music: Big Apple Barbecue Block Party pairs
brisket with blues, providing a two-day lineup of live bands.
Chapter 18: Ten World-Famous Barbecue Events 223

No competition at this one, just tons of incredible food and fun in
the big city.
For more information, go to www.bigapplebbq.org.
Lakeland Pig Festival
Balmy winter fun in Lakeland, Florida, the Lakeland Pig Festival is
all about the barbecue. Pros and backyard cooks compete in sepa-
rate divisions, and kids have their own competition, too.
Founded in not-too-long-ago 1997, the festival quickly drew a fol-
lowing and now attracts 30,000 visitors. There’s music, and a chil-
dren’s area at the festival, but the focus is on the food, and visitors
can take barbecue cooking classes and even sample the efforts of
the competing teams.
Best in the West Nugget 
Rib Cook-Off
A massive, five-day event that takes place over Labor Day, the Best
in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off draws a half-million people to
Sparks, Nevada, for food, six stages of music, an arts-and-crafts
show, and a rollicking kids’ area.
There’s judging, but this event isn’t sanctioned by one of the major
barbecue associations and so is more a chance to hang out in
the high desert chewing some ribs and having a fine time than to
witness the kind of intense competition you find at other
competitions.
For more information, go to www.nuggetribcookoff.com.
LPQue BBQ Championship
A newer entrant to the competition circuit, the LPQue BBQ
Championship is a summertime event held in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.
This one’s unique because it’s the first major competition within a
new Kansas City Barbecue Society (KCBS) delineation — the
Part V: The Part of Tens 
224

“Competitor Series” — and because it takes advantage of the
series’ allowing changes to the usual KCBS rules by requiring that
all competitors use liquid-propane-fueled cookers.
The departure from charcoal and wood (which still are allowed,
just not as the primary heat source) raised some hackles, but the
event offers a heckuva prize purse (the largest in KCBS history)
and draws some heavy hitters. A barbecue dinner and concert give
visitors a chance to hobnob with the teams.
For more information, go to www.lpque.com.
Blue Ridge BBQ Festival
A state championship event that was introduced in 1994, the Blue
Ridge BBQ Festival has the benefit of great location (at the foot 
of Warrior Mountain and next to the banks of Pacolet River in
Tryon, North Carolina) and a great reputation that draws healthy
competition.
Two days of food, competition, arts, music, and carnival rides for
the kiddies were a must for the summer festival. Going green was a
unique initiative that the organizers introduced in 2006. The effort
paid off by reducing trash at the festival by about a third; organiz-
ers hope to hit the 75 percent mark in trash reduction by 2008. All
that while the festival grows annually, adding teams to the compe-
tition, vendors to the “Main Street” area, and visitors to the lovely
locale.
