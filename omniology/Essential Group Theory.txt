Introduction
Introduction
This short book on group theory is partly based on notes from lectures I gave at Trinity College Dublin 
in 1999 and at Edinburgh University in 2001. The first part of the book is an introduction to elementary 
group theory. It doesn’t aim to cover everything that might be in your introductory course in abstract 
algebra, but just to give a summary of the important points. Perhaps you could read it before you begin 
your course, if you want to read something gentle in advance, or it could be a starting point for revision. 
The second part of the book is about free groups and presentations of groups. This would typically appear 
in a second course on group theory. 
Group theory can seem very abstract and strange when you first encounter it. It involves a different 
mindset and most likely you will not have done this type of mathematics before. But it has a set of 
techniques and beauty of its own and is worth perservering with, and you will find that the G s and Hs 
will soon come to life. 
As with a lot of university mathematics, it depends very much on the language and logic of sets and 
their elements, containment, equality and maps and unless you understand these fully, it is unlikely that 
you will be able to apply them in the context of group theory, where there is even more to think about. 
Most of the elementary proofs in group theory involve these simple but important techniques. I can’t 
stress this enough and have included a preliminary section on sets and maps before the main theme of 
group theory starts. 
I hope that there are as few mistakes as possible, but if you find any, have suggestions to improve the 
book or feel that I have not covered something which should be included please send an email to me at

Sets and Maps
1	 Sets and Maps
This section is primarily for reference, as you will probably have seen most of these definitions before. 
But please at least skim lightly through them as a reminder and refer to them later when necessary. 
1.1	
Sets
Sets are at the very foundation of mathematics. They are difficult to define formally, in order to avoid 
things going wrong. This can be done, with various systems of axioms. But it’s a subject in its own right. 
Better for now if we just naively think of them as collections of elements, and take that as a starting 
point. We will liberally use set notation throughout the book, summarized as follows: 
• x ∈X  means x  is an element of the set X. 
• x /∈X  means x  is not an element of the set X. 
• 
{x, y}  means the set consisting of x  and y. 
• X ⊂Y  or Y ⊃X  means all the elements of X  are in Y . We say X  is a subset of Y  or Y  
contains X. 
• X = Y  means X ⊂Y  and Y ⊂X. This is how sets are proved to be equal, so such proofs 
have two parts. 
• X ⊂Y  will also include the possibility that X = Y. We will not use notation like X ⊆Y. 
• X ∪Y  means the union of X  and Y , the set of elements that are in X  or Y  (or both). 
• X ∩Y  means the intersection of X  and Y , the set of elements that are in X  and Y . 
• X −Y  means the set of elements that are in X  but not in Y . 
• ∅ denotes the set {}  containing no elements. 
A special type of set is a pair which has two elements. This can be either unordered, in which case it is 
of the form 
{x, y}

Sets and Maps
or ordered, in which case it is of the form 
{x, {y}}
Let X  and Y  be sets. Then the cartesian product of X  and Y , written X × Y  is the set of all 
ordered pairs (x, y) with x ∈X  and y ∈Y .
Example 1.1 If X = {1, 2, 3}  and Y = {a, b}  then 
X × Y = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}.
1.2	
Maps
A map f  from a set X  to a set Y  is a subset of X × Y  such that for all x ∈X  there exists a 
unique y ∈Y  with (x, y) in the map. X  is called the domain of the map and Y  is called the range 
of the map. 
We usually write f : X →Y . We also write f(x) = y  to denote the unique y  with (x, y) in the map, 
or x →y.
Let f : X →Y  be a map of sets. 
1.	 We write f(X) or Im(f) to denote the subset of Y  given by 
{f(x)|x ∈X}.
This is called the image of f . 
2.	 Let Z  be a subset of Y . We write f −1(Z)  for the subset of X  given by 
{x|f(x) ∈Z}.
This is called the inverse image of Z  under f . 
3.	 f  is called injective if for all w  and x  in X, f(w) = f(x) implies that w = x . 
4.	 f  is called surjective if for all y ∈Y  there exists x ∈X  with f(x) = y . 
5.	 f  is called bijective if it is injective and surjective.

1.3	
Equivalence Relations and Partitions
A map from a set X  to itself is, by definition, a special kind of subset of X × X.
An arbitrary subset of X × X  is called a relation on X. 
For example, let X  be the set of all people. Then we can define a function from X  to itself given by 
x →father of x
This is a function because everyone has a unique father. If we attempt to define a function by 
x →child of x
then this doesn’t define a function correctly because 
• x  may have no children 
• x  may have more than one child 
However, it still defines a valid relation. Let X  be a set and let R  be a relation on X. If w  and x  are 
both elements of X  then we will write w ∼x  to mean (w, x) ∈R  and refer to the relation as . 
A relation ∼ on X  is reflexive if for all x ∈X  we have x ∼x . 
A relation ∼ on X  is symmetric if for all w  and x  in X , w ∼x  implies x ∼w .
A relation ∼ on X  is transitive if for all v , w  and x  in X , v ∼w  and w ∼x  implies that 
v ∼x .
 
Definition 1.2 An equivalence relation on a set X  is a relation on X  that is reflexive, symmetric and 
transitive. 
If x  is an element of x  then we write 
[x] = {y ∈X|y ∼x}.

Sets and Maps
This is called the equivalence class of x . Note that it is well defined, i.e. if w ∼x  then [w] = [x].
Definition 1.3 Let X  be a set. A partition of X  is a collection of subsets Ai  of X  such that 
x = ∪iAi
and 
Ai ∩Aj = ∅
whenever i ̸= j  
So, given an element x  of X , there is exactly one subset Ai  with x ∈Ai .
Proposition 1.4 Let X  be a set and let ∼ be an equivalence relation on X. Then 
{[x]|x ∈X}
is a partition of X. 
Proof. Exercise. □ 
The set of equivalence classes formed is called the quotient set of the original set under the equivalence 
relation. 
1.4	
Modular Arithmetic
Recall that if a  and n > 0 are integers then a mod n  means the remainder when we divide a  by n  
(mod is short for modulo). For example, 10 mod 3 = 1. 
We also a = b mod n  if a mod n = b mod n, and say that a  and b  are equal, or congruent mod n .
The important thing here is that congruence mod n  forms an equivalence relation on the integers. The 
set of equivalence classes are called congruence classes mod n . It is the quotient set under congruence. 
Ordinary addition, subtraction and multiplication of integers then become operations on congruence 
classes. If we write [a] for the congruence class of [a] then for example [3] + [7] = [0] mod [10]. Here 
+ might just look like ordinary addition but it is not. It is implicit in the notation that we are adding, 
then taking the remainder mod 10. We have defined a new operation on a different set.

This section defines what is meant by a group and outlines its basic properties. As we will see, a group 
is a set with just enough extra structure to capture the idea of all symmetries of an object, and how the 
symmetries are related. But while this might be the original motivation for studying groups, we will 
see that they take on an algebraic character of their own, and become mathematical objects worthy of 
study in their own right. 
2.1	
Binary Operations
Let X  be a set. A binary operation on X  is a map from X × X  to X.
Let’s take a while to unravel this definition. Remember that formally 
• A map from a set A  to a set B  is a subset of A × B. So in this case, it is a subset of 
(X × X) × X = X × X × X. 
• For each a ∈A  there exists exactly one b ∈B  such that (a, b) is in the map. So in this 
case, for each (x, y) ∈X × X  there is exactly one z ∈X  with ((x, y), z) in the map.

In a nutshell, the binary operation maps pairs to a single element and the result of the operation always 
exists and is uniquely defined. The elementary arithmetic operations +, −, ∗ and /  are examples of 
binary operations, although to be precise we have to also say what X  is. For example we might think 
that /  is a binary operation on Z  but it is not, for two reasons: 
• The quotient of two integers might not be an integer. Really this is an issue about how we 
define division. If we define it as a fraction then the binary operation does not map to the 
correct set and you could argue that it simply doesn’t make sense in the integers. 
• Even if we define division by taking the result of an integer division and ignoring the 
remainder, we have to worry about division by zero. 
So, if we define division by taking the result of integer division and ignore remainders, we finally obtain 
a binary operation on Z −{0}. Note that what we have defined also then excludes legal division 
operations like 0/2. 
2.2	
Groups: Basic Definitions
In this section we will be dealing with a special type of binary operation. First of all we will denote the 
binary operation by juxtaposition, which is a fancy way of saying writing things next to each other, as 
we do when we write down multiplication in elementary algebra. That is, suppose we have a binary 
operation m  on a set X. Then we write 
m(x, y) = xy
We will write down binary operations like this from now on but it is very important to realise that what 
we write is far more general than just multiplication in elementary algebra. 
Suppose we then write xyz . What does this mean? Does it mean m(m(x, y), z) or does it mean 
m(x, m(y, z)). In other words, does it matter which order we evaluate the binary operation? Is 
(xy)z = x(yz)
always, for any binary operation? Well, no. Why should it be? We have simply defined binary operations 
in terms of subsets of cartesian products and they could be anything. The above is a special property 
called associativity.
A binary operation on a set X  is called an associative operation if for all x, y  and z  in X  we have 
(xy)z = x(yz)

An identity for a binary operation on a set X  is an element e  of X  such that for all x ∈X, 
ex = xe = x.
That is, multiplication by e  has no effect on any element, just leaves it as it is. Again, there is no reason 
whatsoever why such an element should exist. For example, suppose X  is the set {1, . . . , 100}  and 
define a binary operation on X  that sends every single pair of elements of X  to 1. Then for any integer 
x  in {2, . . . , 100}  there can be no element e  with ex = x. 
The final property of binary operations that will concern us is the following.
Suppose that a binary operation on a set X  has an identity e . Then an inverse for x ∈X  is an 
element w ∈X  such that 
xw = wx = e
So that the inverse x  “undoes” the effect of multiplying by x . It is usually denoted by x−1. 
The definition of a group puts these three concepts together.
Definition 2.1 A group is a pair G = (X, m), where X  is a set called the underlying set of G  and m  
is a binary operation on X  called the group law or multiplication of G, written m(g, h) = gh, such that 
the following axioms hold. (Typically we say g ∈G  to mean g ∈X). 
1.	 For all g ,h  and k  in G, g(hk) = (gh)k, i.e. the group law is associative. 
2.	 The group law has an identity. That is, there exists e ∈G  such that for all g ∈G, 
eg = ge = g. 
3.	 Every element of G has an inverse. That is, for all g ∈G there exists g−1 ∈G  such that 
gg−1 = g−1g = e. 
Exercise 2.2 Show that if G  is a group and g  and h  are elements of G  then (gh)−1 = h−1g−1. 
In a group G  the identity is unique. For suppose that e  and f  are identities in G. Then e = ef = f. 
Given an element g ∈G  the inverse of g  is unique… 
Let g  be a group and let g ∈G. As in everyday arithmetic, we write g2 for gg  and, inductively, gn  
for gn−1g  if n  is an integer greater than 1. Similarly we write g−n  for (gn)−1 = (g−1)n.

Groups
Did you find it a little strange there, where (gh)−1 = h−1g−1 and not g−1h−1? This is because in general 
in a group, gh  is not equal to hg . The groups where this does occur are quite special.
Definition 2.3 Let G  be a group such that for all g  and h  in G  we have gh = hg. Then G  is called an 
abelian group. 
Exercise 2.4 Let G  be a group. Show 
1.	 G  is abelian if and only if for all g  and h  in G, (gh)2 = g2h2. 
2.	 If for all g ∈G, g2 = e, then G is abelian. 
In an abelian group we usually denote the group law by + and the inverse of a group element g  by −g. 
Similarly we write ng  instead of gn. 
Definition 2.5 If the underlying set X  of a group G  is finite then we say that G  is a finite group. The 
number of elements of X is then called the order of G  and is written |G|. A group that is not finite is called 
an infinite group.

2.3	
Examples of Groups
We now give some examples of groups. The reader should verify the axioms for a group in each case. 
Example 2.6 
1.	 The empty set can’t be given a group structure since the identity axiom for a group requires 
the existence of at least one element. Thus the simplest possible group is the trivial group 
which has order 1. This has one element e  and the product structure must be e2 = e. The 
next smallest group has order 2. If we denote its elements by e  and a  then the product 
structure is given by e2 = e, ea = a = ae  and a2 = e. This is called the cyclic group of 
order 2, denoted Z2.
It is convenient for low order examples to record the product structure of a finite group in a 
table. For the trivial group this is 
e
e
e
And for Z2 it is  
e

2.	 To generalize the last two examples, let n  be a positive integer. The integers modulo n  form 
a group of order n  under addition modulo n. This is denoted by Zn and is called the cyclic 
group of order n. Also if p  is a prime then the nonzero integers modulo p  form a group of 
order p −1 under multiplication modulo p. 
3.	 The Klein Four-Group has elements e  (the identity), a , b  and c  such that every element 
squared is the identity, and the product of any two nonidentity elements always gives the 
third. It has the following group table.

• The set of integers Z  with the operation of addition 
• The set of rational numbers Q  with the operation of addition 
• The set of real numbers R  with the operation of addition 
• The set of complex numbers C  with the operation of addition 
• The set of rational numbers, excluding zero, Z −{0}  with the operation of 
multiplication 
• The set of real numbers, excluding zero, R −{0}  with the operation of multiplication 
• The set of complex numbers, excluding zero, C −{0}  with the operation of 
multiplication 
These are all examples of infinite groups. 
5.	 The set of n × n  invertible matrices over R  forms a group under matrix multiplication, 
denoted GL(n, R). called the general linear group Similarly for invertible matrices over Q  
or C. 
6.	 A bijection (bijective map) from a set X  to itself is called a permutation of X . Let 
Sym(X) denote the set of permutations of a set X. If f  and g  are in Sym(X) then we 
write fg  for the composition f ◦g . Now composition of maps is associative, and there is 
the identity map id : X →X  given by id(x) = x  which satisfies f ◦id = f = id ◦f  for 
all maps f : X →X . Moreover, every bijection f  from X  to itself has an inverse f −1, 
which is also a bijection. Hence Sym(X) is a group under composition. In particular, if X  
is a finite set of n  elements then we obtain a finite group, called the nth symmetric group, 
which we denote by Sn . It is easy to see that for each n, Sn  has order n!. 
Let X = {1, 2, 3}  be a set with three elements. Then Sym(X) has 3! = 6 elements. These 
are as follows.

7.	 The dihedral group D2n  is the group of symmetries of an n -sided regular polygon. For 
example a square has 8 such symmetries, 4 rotational symmetries through angles of 0, 90

degrees and s  denotes one of the reflections then the 8 elements of D8 are e ,r ,r2,r3,s ,rs

Subgroups
3	 Subgroups
This section concerns subgroups, groups within groups. The type of subgroups a group can contain is a 
primary concern of group theory. 
3.1	
Definition of a Subgroup
A subgroup is the group-theoretic analogy of a subset in set theory. To be a genuine analogy the definition 
has to say something about group structure too.
Definition 3.1 Let G = (X, m) be a group. A nonempty subset H  of X  is called a subgroup of G  if 
(H, m) is also a group. 
So a subgroup of a group G  is a nonempty subset of G  which is a group with respect to the multiplication 
it inherits from G. 
Example 3.2 Consider multiplication table of the symmetric group S3 from the last section. We see that 
{e}  {e, u} , {e, v} , {e, w}  and {e, a, a2}  are all subgroups of S3. In fact these are the only ones. 
Exercise 3.3 List the subgroups of D8. 
The following is important. It is usually how you would prove that something is a subgroup:
Theorem 3.4 Let G  be a group. Then a nonempty subset H  of G  is a subgroup of G  if and only if the 
following two conditions hold 
1.	 For all h  and k  in H, hk  is in H. 
2.	 For all h  in H , h−1 is in H. 
Proof. It is clear that a subgroup satisfies the two conditions. Conversely, suppose that H  is any subset 
of G  which satisfies the two conditions. By the first condition the group law on G  defines a group 
law on H. The axiom of associativity holds since it does in H. Since H  is nonempty there exists an 
element h ∈H. By the second condition the inverse h−1 of h  in G  belongs to H. Thus by the first 
condition, hh−1 = eG ∈H, which is also the identity of H. Now the axiom of inverses holds by the 
second condition. □ 
Exercise 3.5 Show that the two conditions in the previous theorem are equivalent to the following one: 
For all h  and k  in H, hk−1 ∈H.

Subgroups
If G  is a group then G  and {e}  are always subgroups of G. A subgroup of G  not equal to G  is called 
a proper subgroup. Sometimes you will see the notation H ⩽G  meaning H  is a subgroup of G  and 
H < G  meaning H  is a proper subgroup of G. This is analogous to the set-theoretic notation X ⊂Y  
and X ⊆Y. But we will not stick to this convention strictly, so H < G  is usually just used to mean 
any subgroup. 
Exercise 3.6 Let G  be a group and let H  and K  be subgroups of G. 
1.	 Show that H ∩K  is a subgroup of G . 
2.	 Show that if H ∪K  is a subgroup of G  then either H ⊂K  or K ⊂H. 
3.	 Define HK  to be the subset {hk | h ∈H1, k ∈K}  and define KH  analogously. Show 
that HK  is a subgroup of G  if and only if HK = KH. (This happens, for example, when 
G  is abelian.) 
3.2	
Cosets
Definition 3.7 Let H  be a subgroup of G . Then given an element g  of G, we define 
gH = {gh | h ∈H}  and Hg = {hg | h ∈H}. Any set of the form gH  for some g ∈G  is 
called a left coset of H. Similarly, any set of the form Hg  for some g ∈G  is called a right coset. 
Exercise 3.8 Let H  be the subgroup {e, u}  of S3. Calculate the left and right cosets of H. 
In a non-abelian group the left cosets and right cosets of a subgroup are not necessarily the same. But 
cosets always have the following important property:
Theorem 3.9 The left (or right) cosets of a subgroup H  of G  form a partition of G. Moreover there is a 
bijection between any two left (or right) cosets. 
Proof. We prove the case for left cosets. The case for right cosets is identical. Let g  be in G. Then g  is in 
the coset Hg. Hence G  is equal to the union of all cosets of H. To show that the cosets of H  partition 
G  we must show that two non-equal cosets are disjoint. Let Hg1 and Hg2 be two cosets of H  in G. 
Suppose that there exists g ∈Hg1 ∩Hg2. We want to show that Hg1 = Hg2. Let hg1 ∈Hg1 and 
choose h1 and h2 in H  such that g = h1g1 and g = h2g2. Then equating, we have h1g1 = h2g2. So 
hg1 = hh−1
1 h2g2. Since H  is a subgroup of G, hh−1
1 h2 ∈H  and we have hg1 ∈Hg2. Similarly every 
element of Hg2 is in Hg1 and these cosets are equal. Thus the cosets of H  in G  form a partition of G.

Subgroups
We now show that given two cosets Hg1 and Hg2 of H  in G  there exists a bijection θ : Hg1 →Hg2. If 
hg1 ∈Hg1 then define θ(hg1) = hg2. Then θ  is surjective since given hg2 ∈Hg2 the element hg1 ∈Hg1 
satisfies θ(hg1) = hg2. Suppose that θ(h1g1) = θ(h2g1). Then h1g2 = h2g2 and hence h1 = h2. This 
shows that θ  is also injective and hence a bijection. □ 
3.3	
Lagrange’s Theorem
Theorem 3.10 (Lagrange’s Theorem) If G  is a finite group and H  is a subgroup of G  then |H|  
divides |G|. 
Proof. By the previous theorem in the last section, each left coset of H  contains |H|  elements. Now 
since G  is partitioned by the left cosets of H, we must have |G| = n|H|  for some integer n . □ 
Corollary 3.11 Let G  be a finite group of prime order. Then the only subgroups of G  are {e}  and G. 
Proof. If H  is a subgroup of G  and |G|  is a prime number p  then |H|  divides p  so |H|  is 1 or p. 
Hence H = {e}  or H = G. □ 
If G  is a group and H  is a subgroup of G  then the number, if finite, of cosets of H  in G  is called the 
index of H  in G  and is written |G : H|. (If H  has infinitely many cosets in G  then we say that it has 
infinite index in G.) If G  is finite then clearly every subgroup H  of G  has finite index, and we see by 
Lagrange’s theorem above that in this case |G : H|  must divide |G|. 
Exercise 3.12 Find the left and right cosets of the subgroups of D8. 
Exercise 3.13 Let G  be a group and let H  be a subgroup of G. If g  and k  are elements of G, write 
g ∼k  if and only if gk−1 ∈H. Show that ∼ is an equivalence relation on G. What are the equivalence 
classes of ∼?

Generators and Cyclic Groups
4	 Generators and Cyclic Groups
In this section we will look at cyclic groups, which are directly related to modular arithmetic. Cyclic 
groups have strong number-theoretic properties. 
4.1	
Orders of Group Elements
Definition 4.1 Let G  be a group and let g  be an element of G. If there exists an integer n ⩾1 such that 
gn = e  then we call g  a finite order element of G  and the smallest integer n ⩾1 such that gn = e  is 
called the order of G, written o(g). Otherwise we say that g  has infinite order. 
Exercise 4.2 If G  is an abelian group, then show that its set of finite order elements forms a subgroup 
(called its torsion subgroup). Find an example to show that this is not true in general groups. (Hint: 
Consider 2 by 2 matrices.) 
Theorem 4.3 (Properties of Orders) Let G  be a group and let o(g) = n. Then 
1.	 gk = e  if and only if n  divides k . 
2.	 gi = gj  if and only if i  is congruent to j  mod n . 
Proof.

Generators and Cyclic Groups
1.	 If n  divides k  then k = nq  for some natural number q  and hence 
gk = gnq = gq = e.
Conversely, suppose that gk = e . Suppose that k = nq + r  for some natural numbers q  and 
r  with 0 ⩽r < n . Then 
e = gk = gnq+r = (gn)qgr = eqgr = gr.
But n  is the smallest integer with gn = e  and r < n  so we must have r = 0. This means that 
k = nq  and that n  divides k . 
2.	 If gi = gj  then gi−j = e , in which case n  divides (i −j) by the first part, i.e. i  is 
congruent to j  mod n. 
□ 
Exercise 4.4 Let G  be a group and let g  and h  be finite order elements of G. 
1.	 Show that o(g) = o(g−1), o(g) = o(h−1gh) and o(gh) = o(hg). 
2.	 If G  is abelian, o(g) = m  and o(h) = n , show that o(gh) divides mn . Give an example 
to show that o(gh) need not be equal to mn . What more can be said? 
4.2	
Generating Sets
Definition 4.5 If X  is a subset of a group G  then the subgroup of X  generated by X, written ⟨X⟩, 
is the unique subgroup of G  containing X  such that for all subgroups H of G  containing X , H  
contains ⟨X⟩. 
Proposition 4.6 Let X  be a subset of a group G. Then ⟨X⟩ is the set of all elements of G  of the form 
xn1
1 xn2
2 · · · xnm
m ,
where xi ∈X  for each i , ni ∈Z  for each i  and m ∈N. 
Proof. Exercise. □ 
If X is a subset of a group G  and ⟨X⟩= G  then we say that G  is generated by X  or that X  is a 
generating set for G, and call the elements of X  generators of G. If there exists a finite generating set 
for G  then we say that G  is finitely generated.

Generators and Cyclic Groups
4.3	
Cyclic Groups
Definition 4.7 A group is called cyclic if it has a generating set consisting of a single element. 
Theorem 4.8 Finite groups of prime order are cyclic. 
Proof. Suppose that the order of G  is p  where p  is a prime. Either G  is trivial, in which case it is cyclic 
of order 1, or there exists an element g ∈G  with g ̸= e . Now the order of ⟨a⟩ divides p  by Lagrange’s 
theorem, and since a ̸= e, ⟨a⟩ has order p  and G = ⟨g⟩. Hence G  is cyclic. □ 
Exercise 4.9 
1.	 Show that cyclic groups are abelian. 
2.	 Show that subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic. 
3.	 Let G  be a finite cyclic group of order n  generated by g . 
a)	 Show that every subgroup of G  is of the form ⟨gt⟩, where t  divides n. 
b)	 Show that for any natural number k , the subgroup of G  generated by gk  is that 
generated by gt  where t  is the highest common factor of k  and n. 
c)	 Hence show that gk  is a generator of G  if and only if k  and n  are coprime. 
4.	 Consider the cyclic group Z  under addition and denote by nZ  the subgroup generated by 
n. 
a)	 Find a necessary and sufficient condition on the positive integers m  and n  for mZ  
to be a subgroup of nZ. 
b)	 Show that 6Z ∩9Z = 18Z. If mZ ∩nZ = qZ  then what is the relation between q, 
m  and n ? 
Proposition 4.10 Let G  be a finite group of order n . Then for all g ∈G, 
1.	 o(g) divides n. 
2.	 gn = e. 
Proof. Let g ∈G. 
1.	 The order of ⟨g⟩ is equal to o(g), so this follows from Lagrange’s theorem. 
2.	 Let k = o(g). Then by the first part n = kr  for some integer r. Hence an = (ak)r = er = e

Fermat’s Little Theorem
The following exercise gives an application of group theory to number theory. 
Exercise 4.11 Let n  be a natural number and let Zn be the set of congruence classes of integers mod 
n. Let U(Zn) denote the set of such classes [m] with (m, n) = 1. Then show that U(Zn) is a group 
under multiplication and if p  is a prime then U(Zp) has order p −1 
Hence prove 
1.	 (Fermat’s Little Theorem) Let p  be a prime. Then for all a ∈Z  with a ̸= 0 mod p  we have 
ap−1 = 1 mod p  and hence ap = a  mod p. 
2.	 What does Fermat’s Little Theorem allow us to deduce about 
a)	 26 
b)	 27 
c)	 numbers of the form 2n? 
3.	 (Euler’s Generalisation) Define the Euler function φ  from N  to N  as follows. φ(n) is the 
number of integers k  with 1 ⩽k < n  and (k, n) = 1. Then for any n > 0 and a  such 
that (a, n) = 1 we have aφ(n) = 1 mod n.

Mappings of Groups
5	 Mappings of Groups
In most types of mathematics there are objects and maps which preserve the structure of these objects. 
In group theory, a map should preserve the multiplicative structure of the group in order to count as a 
real group-theoretic map. 
5.1	
Homomorphisms
Definition 5.1 Let G  and H  be groups. Then a map φ : G →H  is called a homomorphism if for all g  
and k  in G , φ(gk) = φ(g)φ(k). 
Exercise 5.2 If G  is an abelian group then show that the map φ : G →G  given by φ(g) = gn  is a 
homomorphism. 
Proposition 5.3 (Properties of Homomorphisms) Let φ : G →H  be a homomorphism of groups. Then 
1.	 φ(eG) = eH. 
2.	 For all g ∈G, (φ(g))−1 = φ(g−1). 
Proof. 
1.	 For all g ∈G, geG = g  so we have 
φ(geG) = φ(g)φ(eG) = φ(g).
Thus φ(eG) = eH. 
2.	 Since gg−1 = eG  we have 
φ(g)φ(g−1) = φ(gg−1) = φ(eG) = eH.
Thus as claimed, (φ(g))−1 = φ(g−1). 
□ 
Example 5.4 To specify a homomorphism φ  from G  to H  we only need to specify the images under 
φ  of a generating set X  of G. Since every element g  of G  can be written as a product xn1
1 · · · xnm
m  of 
terms x1, . . . , xm  in X, we have

=
φ(xn1
1 ) · · · φ(xnm
m )
=
φ(x1)n1 · · · φ(xm)nm.
There are, however, restrictions on the possible images under φ  of the generators. For example suppose 
that we wish to find all possible homomorphisms from Z3 to Z12. Z3 is cyclic, generated by 1, so a 
homomorphism φ : Z3 →Z12 is determined by φ(1). Now we also have to have 
φ(1 + 1 + 1) = φ(0) = 0,
i.e. 3φ(1) is congruent to 0 mod 12, which means that φ(1) = 4k  for some integer k . This gives us the 
trivial homomorphism where φ(1) = 0 and Im(φ) = {0}  and two nontrivial injective homomorphisms 
given by φ(1) = 4 and φ(1) = 8. 
Exercise 5.5 Calculate all homomorphisms Z6 →Z4 and Z12 →Z5. Generalise to Zm →Zn for 
arbitrary natural numbers m  and n. 
5.2	
Isomorphisms
Definition 5.6 An isomorphism is a homormorphism between groups that is also a bijection. 
We say that groups G  and H  are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism between them, and write 
G ∼= H. We usually consider two groups to be “the same” if they are isomorphic. More formally, 
Theorem 5.7 Isomorphism is an equivalence relation on any set of groups. 
Proof. Let G, H  and K  be groups. The identity map is an isomorphism from a group G  to itself so 
isomorphism is reflexive. Suppose that φ : G →H  is an isomorphism. Then φ−1 is an isomorphism 
(check) from H  to G  so isomorphism is symmetric. Transitivity follows since if φ : G →H  and 
ψ : H →K  are isomorphisms then φ ◦ψ : G →K  is an isomorphism (check). □ 
Example 5.8 We can write down a list of finite groups of order n  up to isomorphism, where n ⩽6. 
There is clearly only one group of order 1, the trivial group. Also, since 2, 3 and 5 are primes, there 
is only one group of each of these orders, up to isomorphism, and this is the cyclic group of the given 
order. There are, however, two non-isomorphic groups of order 4. Suppose G  is a group of order 4. 
If there exists an element of G  of order 4 then G ∼= Z4. Otherwise, by Lagrange’s theorem, each non-
identity element of G, say a, b  and c, must have order 2. Now ab ̸= a  since b ̸= e . Also, ab ̸= e  since 
a−1 = a. Thus ab = c  and similarly ba = c, ac = ca = b  and bc = cb = a. Thus G  is isomorphic to 
the Klein four group.

Exercise 5.9 Now suppose that G  is a group of order 6. Show, by considering possible orders of elements, 
that G  is isomorphic to either Z6 or S3. 
Exercise 5.10 Let G  be a group. An isomorphism from G  to itself is called an automorphism of G. 
1.	 Prove that the set of automorphisms of G  forms a group under composition (which we 
denote by Aut(G)). 
2.	 Show that Aut(Z) ∼= Z2. 
3.	 Show that Aut(Z3) ∼= Z2 and generalise to cyclic groups of all orders.

Normal Subgroups
6	 Normal Subgroups
In this section we define a special type of subgroup called a normal subgroup. It will become apparent 
in the next section on quotient groups why this is such an important concept. 
6.1	
Conjugates and Normal Subgroups
Let H  be a subgroup of a group G  and let g ∈G. Then consider the subset 
g−1Hg = {g−1hg|h ∈H}
of G. In fact, g−1Hg  is a subgroup of G  for suppose that g−1h1g  and g−1h2g  are elements of g−1Hg , 
where h1 and h2 are in H. Then g−1h1gg−1h2g = g−1h1h2g . Since h1 and h2 are in H  and H  is 
a subgroup of G, h1h2 ∈H, so we have that the product of two elements of g−1Hg  is in g−1Hg . 
Similarly, if g−1hg ∈g−1Hg , where h ∈H, then (g−1hg)−1 = g−1h−1g . Since h ∈H  and H  is a 
subgroup of G, h−1 ∈H. Hence the inverses of elements of g−1Hg  are also in g−1Hg  and we have 
shown that g−1Hg  is a subgroup of G. We can in fact say more. 
Proposition 6.1 Let H  be a subgroup of a group G. Then for all g ∈G, g−1Hg  is isomorphic to H. 
Proof. Fix g ∈G  and define the map φ : H →g−1Hg  by φ(h) = g−1hg . Then for all h1 and h2 in 
H  we have 
φ(h1h2) = g−1h1h2g = g−1h1gg−1h2g = φ(h1)φ(h2).
Thus φ  is a homomorphism. φ  is clearly surjective, since given g−1hg ∈g−1Hg , the element h ∈H  
satisfies φ(h) = g−1hg . Suppose that g−1h1g = g−1h2g . Premultiplying by g  and postmultiplying by 
g−1 we see that h1 = h2. Thus φ  is injective. We have shown that φ  is an isomorphism and hence 
H  is isomorphic to g−1Hg . □ 
We call g−1Hg  a conjugate of H. We say that two subgroups H1 and H2 of a group G  are conjugate if 
there exists g ∈G  such that H1 = g−1H2g . Conjugacy is an equivalence relation on the set of subgroups 
of G, and the corresponding equivalence classes are called conjugacy classes.
Definition 6.2 A subgroup H  of a group G  is called normal if for all g ∈G  and for all h ∈H, 
g−1hg ∈H. 
Equivalently a subgroup H  of a group G  is normal if and only if the only subgroup of G  conjugate 
to H  is H  itself.

Normal Subgroups
Example 6.3 If G  is an abelian group then every subgroup H  of G  is normal, since for all g ∈G  and 
h ∈H , g−1hg = g−1gh = h. 
Exercise 6.4 List all the proper subgroups of the symmetric group S3. For which subgroups are the left 
cosets equal to the right cosets? What are the conjugacy classes of subgroups of S3? 
6.2	
Cosets of Normal Subgroups
Theorem 6.5 Let G  be a group and let H  be a subgroup of G. Then H  is a normal subgroup of G  if 
and only if for all g ∈G, gH = Hg . 
Proof. Suppose that H  is a normal subgroup of G  and let hg  be an element of Hg , where h ∈H. 
Then g−1hg ∈H. Suppose that it is equal to the element h′  of H. Then hg = gh′  and hg ∈gH. We 
have shown that Hg ⊂gH. Similarly gH ⊂Hg  and these two cosets are equal. 
Conversely given g ∈G  and h ∈H  we have by hypothesis hg ∈gH. Hence hg = gh′  for some h′ ∈H. 
Hence as required, g−1hg = h′, which is in H, and H  is a normal subgroup of G. □ 
Thus normal subgroups have the same left and right cosets. 
Exercise 6.6 Show that if G  is a group and H  is a subgroup of G  of index 2 then H  is normal. 
Exercise 6.7 
1.	 Let N  be a normal subgroup of a group G  and let H  be any subgroup of G . Show that 
NH  is a subgroup of G. 
2.	 If H  and K  are normal subgroups of a group G  then show that H ∩K  is a normal 
subgroup of G. 
3.	 If H  is a subgroup of a group G  and K  is a normal subgroup of G  then show that 
H ∩K  is a normal subgroup of H. 
6.3	
Kernels of Homomorphisms
Definition 6.8 Let G  and H  be groups and let φ  be a homomorphism from G  to H. Then the kernel of 
φ , written ker(φ)  is the subset of G  given by 
{g ∈G|φ(g) = eH}.

Normal Subgroups
In other words, the kernel is the inverse image of eH  under φ . The kernel of a homomorphism measures 
its lack of injectivity: Clearly the kernel of a homomorphism φ : G →H  is equal to G  if and only if 
φ  is the zero map. At the opposite end of the scale, we have the following. 
Proposition 6.9 Let G  and H  be groups, and let φ : G →H  be a homomorphism. Then ker(φ) = {eG}  
if and only if φ  is injective. 
Proof. Suppose that φ : G →H  is injective and φ(g) = eH. Then since φ(eG) = eH  for any 
homomorphism φ, we have g = eG  by injectivity. Thus ker(φ) = {eG}. Conversely, suppose that 
ker(φ) = {eG}  and that for g1 and g2 in G, φ(g1) = φ(g2). Then by the homomorphism law, 
φ(g1g−1
2 ) = eH. So g1g−1
2
∈ker(φ), i.e. we have g1g−1

Theorem 6.10 If G  and H  are groups and φ  is a homomorphism from G  to H  then ker(φ)  is a 
normal subgroup of G. 
Proof. Let k1 and k2 be in ker(φ). Then 
φ(k1k2) = φ(k1)φ(k2) = eGeG = eG.

Normal Subgroups
Thus k1k2 ∈ker(φ). Also, if k ∈ker(φ) then 
φ(k−1) = (φ(k))−1 = e−1
G = eG,
so k−1 ∈ker(φ). So far we have shown that ker(φ) is a subgroup of G . Now let k ∈ker(φ) and 
g ∈G. Then we have 
φ(g−1kg) = φ(g−1)φ(k)φ(g) = (φ(g))−1φ(g) = eG.
Hence g−1kg ∈ker(φ), showing that ker(φ) is a normal subgroup of G. □ 
Exercise 6.11 Let φ  be a homomorphism from a group G  to a group H. Then ker(φ) is the inverse 
image under φ  of eH. Show that if K  is any subgroup of H  then its inverse image under φ  is a 
subgroup of G. Moreover show that if K  is normal then so is its inverse image. 
Exercise 6.12 Let H  be a subgroup of a group G . Then the normaliser NGH  of H  is the subset 
{g ∈G | Hg = gH}  of G. Note that if H  is a normal subgroup of G  then NGH = G. 
1.	 Show that NGH  is a subgroup of G  and that H  is a normal subgroup of NGH . Show that 
NGH  is the largest subgroup of G  in which H  is normal. 
2.	 Show that g−1
1 Hg1 = g−1
2 Hg2 if and only if g1 and g2 belong to the same right coset of 
N(H) in G. Hence show that if G  is finite then the number of subgroups of G  conjugate 
to H  is equal to | G | / | N(H) |. 
As a converse to theorem 6.10, given a normal subgroup H  of G  we can always find a group K  and 
a homomorphism φ : G →K  such that H = ker(φ). This idea is embodied in the next two sections.

Quotient Groups
7	 Quotient Groups
This section shows how a quotient of a group may be formed by grouping together cosets to form 
elements of the quotient group. It is a direct generalisation of division in arithmetic. 
7.1	
Products of Cosets
Let H  be a normal subgroup of a group G  and let g1H  and g2H  be two left cosets of H. Then we 
define their product (g1H)(g2H) to be the left coset g1g2H  of H. Now there is a potential problem 
here. Suppose that g1H = g3H  were equal to g4H = g2H  without g1g2H  being equal to g3Hg4H . 
Then which of these cosets do we define the product to be? This situation occurs often in mathematics 
and is usually referred to as checking that something is well defined. 
Proposition 7.1 If H  is a normal subgroup of a group G  then the product of left cosets of H  is well 
defined, i.e. if g1H = g3H  and g2H = g4H  then g1g2H = g3g4H. 
Proof. Suppose that g1H = g3H  and g2H = g4H. Then g−1
3 g1 ∈H. Suppose that g−1
3 g1 = h1 ∈H. 
Similarly we can find h2 ∈H  such that g−1
4 g2 = h2. Thus g1g2 = g3h1g4h2. But since H  is a normal 
subgroup, Hg4 = g4H  and we can find h3 ∈H  such that h1g4 = g4h3. Hence 
g1g2H = g3g4h3h2H = g3g4H
as required. □ 
Thus the product of left cosets is a binary operation on the set of left cosets of H. Note how this depends 
on H  being a normal subgroup.
7.2	
Quotient Groups
Proposition 7.2 If H  is a normal subgroup of a group G  then the product of left cosets equips the set of 
left cosets of H  with the structure of a group. 
Proof. Let g1H, g2H  and g3H  be three left cosets of H. Then 
[(g1H)(g2H)](g3H)
=
(g1g2H)(g3H)
=
(g1g2)g3H
=
g1(g2g3)H
=
g1H(g2g3H)
=
g1H[(g2H)(g3H)].

Quotient Groups
Thus the product of left cosets is associative. Now an identity is the left coset eH = H, since for all g ∈G, 
(eH)(gH) = egH = gH  and (gH)(eH) = geH = gH. Also, if g ∈G, then (gH)(g−1H) = eH = H  
and (g−1H)(gH) = eH = H. Thus g−1H  is the inverse of the left coset gH. □ 
We call the group defined above the quotient group of G  by the normal subgroup H, written G/H. 
Note that we could equally well have defined quotient groups in terms of right cosets. 
Example 7.3 Let G  be the cyclic group Z12. The subgroup H  of G  generated by 4 consists of 
the elements 4,8 and 0 and is isomorphic to Z3. It is clearly normal. The cosets of H  are H, 
1 + H , 2 + H  and 3 + H  (since Z12 is abelian, we use additive instead of multiplicative notation). The 
product structure on the cosets is exemplified as follows. (1 + H) + (1 + H) = (1 + 1) + H = 2 + H, 
(2 + H) + (1 + H) = 3 + H  and (3 + H) + (1 + H) = H. From this information we readily deduce 
that the coset 1 + H  generates G/H  and that G/H ∼= Z4. 
Exercise 7.4 Show that if G  is an abelian group and N  is a subgroup of G  (which is automatically 
normal) then G/N  is abelian. Thus quotients of abelian groups are abelian. 
Exercise 7.5 
1.	 Let G  be a group and let H1 and H2 be subgroups of G. Let ∼ be the relation defined 
on pairs of elements g1 and g2 of G  by g1 ∼g2 if and only if there exist h1 ∈H1 and 
h2 ∈H2 such that x = h1yh2. Show that ∼ is an equivalence relation on G. 
2.	 The corresponding equivalence classes are called double cosets of the pair (H1, H2), and 
we write H1gH2 for the double coset containing g . Give an example to show that, unlike 
ordinary cosets, two double cosets H1g1H2 and H1g2H2 don’t necessarily have the same 
cardinality. 
One of the big achievements in twentieth century mathematics was the Classification of the Finite Simple 
Groups (For an account, see [7]). Quotient groups are one of the tools used to study finite groups. A 
group is called simple if it has no normal subgroups other than the identity subgroup and itself. Finite 
simple groups are analogous to prime numbers. Finite groups that are not simple can be broken down 
into a chain of finitely many simple groups called a composition series. These series are essentially unique, 
by a theorem called the Jordan-Hölder theorem.

The First Isomorphism Theorem
8	 The First Isomorphism Theorem
The main theorem in this section, the first isomorphism theorem, is used in many places in group theory. 
8.1	
The First Isomorphism Theorem
Suppose that we are given a homomorphism of groups φ : G →H. Then Im(φ) is a subgroup of H. 
For suppose we are given h1 and h2 in Im(φ). Then there exist g1 and g2 in G  such that φ(g1) = h1 
and φ(g2) = h2. By the homomorphism law, 
h1h−1
2
= φ(g1) (φ(g2))−1 = φ(g1g−1
2 ),
i.e. h1h−1
2
∈Im(φ) and Im(φ) is a subgroup of H. 
Exercise 8.1 Let G  and H  be groups where G  is cyclic and let φ : G →H  be a homomorphism. 
Show that the image of φ  is also cyclic and that if G  is finite then the order of the image divides the 
order of G. Hence show that if G  and H  are any finite groups of coprime orders then there is a unique 
homomorphism from G  to H.

The First Isomorphism Theorem
Theorem 8.2 (First Isomorphism Theorem) Let G  and H  be groups and let φ : G →H  be a 
homomorphism. Then 
G
ker(φ)
∼= Im(φ).
Proof. Let K = ker(φ) and define a map θ  from G/K  to Im(φ) via the rule θ(gK) = φ(g). This is 
well defined because suppose that hK = gK. Then h ∈gK  and there exists k ∈K  such that h = gk. 
So we have 
φ(h) = φ(g)φ(k) = φ(g)eG = φ(g)
and hence θ(hK) = θ(gK). We now show that θ  is a homomorphism. Let g1K  and g2K  be two 
elements of gK. Then 
θ((g1K)(g2K))
=
θ(g1g2K)
=
φ(g1g2)
=
φ(g1)φ(g2)
=
θ(g1K)θ(g2K)
It remains to show that θ  is a bijection. Suppose that θ(gK) = eH . Then φ(g) = eH  and g ∈K. Hence 
gK = K  which is the identity of G/K. This means that θ  is injective. But if h ∈Im(φ) then there exists 
g ∈G  with φ(g) = h. Thus θ(gK) = φ(g) = h  and θ  is surjective and hence an isomorphism. □ 
In particular, if φ  is an surjective then G/ ker(φ) ∼= H. 
There are also second and third isomorphism theorems. We will not treat these here but a good reference 
is [3]. These are also used in many places, such as the proof of the Jordan-Hölder theorem, mentioned 
in the last section. 
Exercise 8.3 Show, using exercise 8.1, that all quotient groups of cyclic groups are cyclic. 
Exercise 8.4 Consider D12, the dihedral group of order 12, generated by elements a  of order 6 and b  
of order 2. Show that H = {e, a3}  is a normal subgroup of D12 (Hint: The easiest way to do this is 
to find a group G  and a homomorphism φ : D12 →G  such that H = ker(φ)). The quotient group 
D12/H  is of order 6 so it is either S3 or C6. Which is it? 
Exercise 8.5 Let SL(n, R) be the subset of the group GL(n, R) of invertible n × n  matrices defined by 
the rule M ∈SL(n, R) if and only if M  has determinant 1. (SL(n, R) is called the special linear group 
over R.) Show that SL(n, R) is a normal subgroup of GL(n, R) and that the quotient is isomorphic to 
the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication.

Centres and Inner Automorphisms
Exercise 8.6 
1.	 Let G  be a group. Show that the subset 
Z(G) = {z ∈G| for all g ∈G, zg = gz}
that is, the set of all elements that commute with every other element, is a normal subgroup of 
G. Z(G) is called the centre of G. A group G  is abelian if and only if Z(G) = G. 
2.	 Recall from exercise 5.10 that the set of all automorphisms (homomorphisms from a group 
to itself) forms a group called Aut(G). Show that if we take any element g  of G  then we 
may define an automorphism of G  by 
φg : g →ghg−1.
3.	 Show that the set of all automorphisms of the above form is a normal subgroup of Aut(G). 
It is called the Inner Automorphism Group of G  and is denoted by Inn(G). 
4.	 Define a map G →Aut(G) by g →φg . Show that it is a homomorphism and its kernel is 
Z(G). Hence deduce that 
G/Z(G) ∼= Inn(G).
Incidentally, the quotient Aut(G)/Inn(G) is called the outer automorphism group and is 
denoted by Out(G).

Group Actions
9	 Group Actions
We have seen that the set of bijections of a set forms a group. In this section we will look at how, given 
a group, we can sometimes consider it as the set of bijections of a set. This can often be used to deduce 
facts about the structure of the group. 
9.1	
Actions of Groups
Let X  be a set. 
An action of a group G  on X  is a homomorphism φ : G →Sym(X). If x ∈X  and g ∈G  then 
we always write gx  instead of (φ(g))(x). Thus the homomorphism condition tells us that for all g  
and h  in G  and for all x ∈X, (gh)x = g(hx)  and ex = x .
Definition 9.1 Suppose that G  is a group acting on a set X  and let x ∈X. Then the stabilizer of x, 
written Gx , is the subset {g ∈G | gx = x}  of X. 
Proposition 9.2 If a group G  acts on a set X  then for all x ∈X , Gx  is a subgroup of G.

Group Actions
Proof. Let g  and h  be elements of Gx . Then ghx = gx = x . Thus gh ∈Gx. Also if g ∈Gx  then 
g−1gx = ex = x. But g−1gx = g−1x  since g  stabilizes x . Hence g−1x = x  and g−1 ∈Gx. Thus 
Gx  is a subgroup of G. □ 
Definition 9.3 Let G  be a group acting on a set X  and let x ∈X. Then the orbit of x  is the subset 
Gx = {gx | g ∈G}  of X. 
If we define two elements of X  to be equivalent if one lies in the orbit of the other then this is an 
equivalence relation (exercise). Thus the orbits partition X.
9.2	
The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem
Let G  be a group acting on a set X  and let x ∈X . Denote the set of left cosets of Gx  in G  by G/Gx , 
even though this is not necessarily a quotient group as Gx  may not be normal. 
Theorem 9.4 (Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem) Let G  be a group acting on a set X  and let x ∈X. Then there 
is a bijection from G/Gx  to Gx. In particular, if G  is finite then for all x ∈X, 
| G |=| Gx || Gx | .
Proof. Let x ∈X  and define the map θ : G/Gx →Gx  via the rule θ(gGx) = gx . Then θ  is well 
defined, for suppose that h ∈Gx. Then g−1h ∈Gx  so g−1hx = x , i.e. hx = gx. 
Let gx  be in the orbit Gx . Then θ(gGx) = gx . Thus θ  is surjective. Now suppose that 
θ(gGx) = θ(hGx). Then gx = hx , i.e. g−1hx = x, which means that g−1h ∈Gx . Thus gGx = hGx. 
So θ  is injective and hence a bijection. 
The last statement follows from Lagrange’s theorem. □ 
Proposition 9.5 Suppose that G  is a group acting on a set X. Let x ∈X  and suppose that y ∈Gx . 
Then Gy  is conjugate in G  to (and in particular isomorphic to) Gx . 
Proof. We have y = gx  for some g ∈G. Let h ∈Gx. Then 
ghg−1(y) = ghg−1gx = ghx = gx = y,
which means that g−1Gyg ⊂Gx. Similarly, since x = g−1y  we have Gx ⊂g−1Gyg . Thus 
g−1Gyg = Gx. □

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Direct Products
10	 Direct Products
In this book we will look at various ways of building up a group from other groups. The simplest of 
these is the direct product, which is a group-theoretic analogue of the cartesian product in set theory. 
10.1	
Direct Products
Definition 10.1 Let (G, .G) and (H, .H) be groups. Then their direct product G × H  is the group whose 
underlying set is the cartesian product G × H  and whose multiplication is given by defining the product 
of two pairs (g1, h1) and (g2, h2) in G × H  as follows. 
(g1, h1)(g2, h2) = (g1.Gg2, h1.Hh2).
As with cartesian products of sets, we can extend the definition of a direct product in the obvious way 
to allow us to form the direct product of finitely many (or even arbitrarily many) groups. 
Exercise 10.2 
1.	 Check that this multiplication does indeed equip the cartesian product G × H  of two 
groups G  and H  with the structure of a group, that the identity of G × H  is (eG, eH) and 
that the inverse of a pair (g, h) ∈G × H  is (g−1, h−1). 
2.	 Show that the direct product of two abelian groups is abelian. 
3.	 Show that for any groups G  and H  we have G × H ∼= H × G. 
4.	 Let G = H × K. Prove that G/H ∼= K  and G/K ∼= H. 
10.2	
Direct Products of Finite Cyclic Groups
Exercise 10.3 Show that Z2 × Z2 is isomorphic to the Klein four group (hence is not cyclic), whereas 
Z2 × Z3 ∼= Z6. 
Lemma 10.4 If p  is a prime number then Zp × Zp  is not cyclic. 
Proof. Let g  and h  generate the first and second copies of Zp respectively. Then let (gm, hn) be an 
element of Zp × Zp . Suppose that (gm, hn)r = eZp×Zp . Then gmr = e  and hnr = e . Thus mr  and nr  
both divide p. Since p  is a prime, m  and n  both divide p . Thus the order of (gm, hn) must divide p . 
So no single element can generate Zm × Zn , since a generating element would have to have order p2. □ 
Theorem 10.5 Zm × Zn ∼= Zmn  if and only if m  and n  are coprime.

Essential Group Theory
44 
Direct Products
Proof. Suppose that G = Zm  is generated by the element g  and H = Zn  is generated by the element 
h . Suppose further that m  and n  are coprime. Since the order of Zm × Zn  is mn , we only need to 
show that this group is cyclic. We claim that the element (g, h) generates Zm × Zn . To see this, let 
t = o((a, b)). Then at = eG  and bt = eH. Thus m  and n  divide t. Hence so does their least common 
multiple which is mn  since m  and n  are coprime. Thus mn  divides t. However, by Lagrange’s theorem, 
t  divides mn  also. Hence o((a, b)) = mn  and Zm × Zn  is cyclic. 
Conversely suppose that m  and n  are not coprime and let p  be a prime number which divides both 
m  and n. Then ⟨g
m
p ⟩× ⟨h
n
p ⟩ is isomorphic to Zp × Zp  so by lemma 10.4 it is a non-cyclic subgroup 
of Zm × Zn . Since subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic, Zm × Zn  can’t be cyclic. □ 
10.3	
Properties of Direct Products
Proposition 10.6 Let G × H  be the direct product of two groups G  and H. Let G0 = {(g, e) | g ∈G}  
and let H0 = {(e, h) | h ∈H}. Then 
1.	 G0 and H0 are normal subgroups of G × H. 
2.	 G0 ∼= G  and H0 ∼= H. 
3.	 Each element of G0 commutes with each element of H0. 
4.	 G0 ∩H0 = {(eG, eH)} , the identity of G × H . 
Proof. 
1.	 G0 is a subgroup of G  since if (g1, e) and (g2, e) are in G0 then 
(g1, e)(g2, e) = (g1.Gg2, e) ∈G0
and if (g, e) ∈G0 then (g, e)−1 = (g−1, e) ∈G0. Now suppose that (g1, h) ∈G  and 
(g2, e) ∈G0. Then 
(g1, h)−1(g2, e)(g1, h) = (g−1
1 g2g1, h−1eh) = (g−1g2g1, e) ∈G0.
Thus G0 is a normal subgroup of G . Similarly H0 is a normal subgroup of G . 
2.	 Define the map θ : G →G0 by θ(g) = (g, e). It is easily checked that θ  is an isomorphism. 
Thus G ∼= G0. Similarly H ∼= H0.

3.	 Let (g, e) ∈G0 and let (e, h) ∈H0. Then 
(g, e)(e, h) = (g, h) = (e, h)(g, e).
4.	 Suppose that (g, h) ∈G0 ∩H0. Then g = e  and h = e . Hence G0 ∩H0 = {(eG, eH)}. 
□ 
Theorem 10.7 Let H  and K  be subgroups of a group G  such that the following three conditions hold. 
1.	 HK = G . 
2.	 H ∩K = {e}. 
3.	 For all g ∈G  and h ∈H, gh = hg . 
Then G ∼= H × K.

Direct Products
Proof. Define the map θ : H × K →G  by θ((h, k)) = hk . Then θ  is a homomorphism since for all 
(h1, k1) and (h2, k2) in H × K, 
θ[(h1, k1)(h2, k2)]
=
θ((h1.Hh2, k1.Kk2))
=
h1h2k1k2
=
h1k1h2k2 (by condition 3)
=
θ((h1, k1))θ((h2, k2)).
To see that θ  is surjective, let g ∈G . Then by condition 1, g = hk  for some h ∈H  and k ∈K . Thus, 
under θ , (h, k) maps to g  and θ  is surjective Before we show that θ  is injective, we claim that every 
g ∈G  can be written uniquely as a product hk  with h ∈H  and k ∈K . To see this, suppose that h1 
and h2 are in H , k1 and k2 are in K  and g = h1k1 = h2k2. Then h1h−1
2
= k2k−1
1 . But h1h−1
2
∈H  
and k2k−1 ∈K  since H  and K  are subgroups of G . Hence h1h−1
2
∈H ∩K  and is equal to e . Thus 
h1 = h2. Similarly k1 = k2. This completes the proof of the claim. 
Now suppose that θ((h, k)) = e . Then hk = e . But ee = e  also, where e ∈H  and e ∈K  (since H  
and K  are subgroups of G ). Thus h = e  and k = e  by the claim. Hence (h, k) = (eH, eK) = eH×K . 
Hence ker(θ) = {eH×K} , i.e. θ  is injective. We have now shown that θ  is an isomorphism, which

Corollary 10.8 Suppose that a group G  can be written as a product HK , where H  and K  are normal 
subgroups of G  such that H ∩K = {e}. Then G ∼= H × K. 
Proof. In the light of theorem 10.7, we only need to show that if H  and K  are normal subgroups of G  
with G = HK  and H ∩K = {e}  then every element of H  commutes with every element of G . Let 
h ∈H  and k ∈K. Then since K  is a normal subgroup of G , h−1k−1h ∈K. Thus (h−1k−1h)k ∈K  
as K  is a subgroup of G. Similarly, k−1hk ∈H  so h−1(k−1hk) ∈H. Thus h−1k−1hk ∈H ∩K. Thus 
h−1k−1hk = e , i.e. hk = kh. □

Sylow Theory
11	 Sylow Theory
Sylow theory can be regarded as the starting point of the theory of finite groups. Recall that Lagrange’s 
theorem states that the order of a subgroup of a finite group must divide the order of the larger group. 
Sylow theory is concerned with the existence of subgroups of a particular order, and is an excellent 
example of the use of actions of groups. 
11.1	
Primes and p-Groups
We will need the following number-theoretic lemma in the next section. 
Lemma 11.1 Let pmk  be a natural number, where p  does not divide k . Then p  does not divide the 
binomial coefficient 
 pmk
pm

.
Proof. Because p  is involved in most of the resulting binomial coefficients, we have 
(a + b)pm = apm + bpm mod p
Thus we obtain two binomial expansions for (a + b)pmk ,

Definition 11.2 Let p  be a prime. A group G  is a p-group if every element of G  has order pn for some 
n ⩾1.

Proof. Apply Lagrange’s theorem. □

Sylow’s Theorem
Example 11.4 Consider the groups G1 = Z2 × Z2 × Z2 × Z2, G2 = Z4 × Z4 and G3 = Z2 × Z8. 
All of these groups have order 16 but no two are isomorphic. G1 has no element of order 4 as every 
nontrivial element has order 2 and G2 has no element of order 8. So we can deduce nothing at all about 
the existence of subgroups of a group of order 16. It may or may not have a subgroup of order 8 and 
it may or may not have a subgroup of order 4. 
The following is a partial converse to Lagrange’s theorem, and is in contrast to Example 11.4. In some 
sense it is the k  in the following theorem that “reacts with the pm  and forms the subgroup”. 
Theorem 11.5 (Sylow) Let G  be a group with order pmk  where k  is not divisible by p . Then G  has a 
subgroup of order pm. 
Proof. There are many ways of proving this theorem. We will follow Wielandt’s proof which uses the left 
action of G  on itself, and the number-theoretic fact about binomial coefficients from the last section. 
Let X  be the set of all subsets of G  of order pm. Then G  acts on X  by left multiplication, as in 
exercise 9.6.

First note that if Y ∈X  then for all y ∈Y , gy = hy  implies that g = h . Suppose then that g ∈GY , 
the stabilizer of GY  and choose y ∈Y . Then there can be at most pm  distinct elements of G  which 
keep y  in Y  by the action. This means that the stabilizer GY  has to satisfy |GY | ⩽pm. 
Let O  be a set consisting of exactly one element of X  from each orbit of this action. Then clearly 
|X| =

o∈O
|Go|
By Lemma 11.1, p  does not divide |X|  so there must be an orbit Go  such that p  does not divide 
|Go| . (If p  divided all of the orbit sizes then we would be able to pull it out as a common factor in the 
right hand side of the above sum, contradicting the fact that p  does not divide |X|). 
By the orbit-stabilizer theorem (theorem 9.4) we have 
|Go| = |G|
|Go| = pmk
|Go| ⩾pm
Since we have shown above that |Go| ⩽pm  too we must have |Go| = pm , so Go  is a subgroup of 
order pm  as required. □ 
Corollary 11.6 The order of a finite p -group is a power of p . 
Proof. Suppose G  is a finite p -group with |G| = pnk  where k ̸= 1 and k  is not divisible by p . Let q  
be a prime dividing k . Then by Sylow’s theorem, G  has a subgroup of order q , which is cyclic. Thus 
G  has an element of order q . But this contradicts the fact that G  is a p -group. □ 
Exercise 11.7 Generalise theorem 11.5 to show that every finite group G with |G|  divisible by a prime 
power pk  has a subgroup of order pk . 
Sylow also proved theorems other than Theorem 11.5, which we will not prove here, but the techniques 
used are similar. Recall that every integer n  can be written as a unique product of powers of prime 
numbers. By theorem 11.5, if p  is a prime number and |G|  is any group then G  has a subgroup H  
of order pm  where m  is the highest power of p  appearing in the prime decomposition of p  (although 
m  could be 0 and H  the trivial subgroup). We will call H  a Sylow p -subgroup of G. 
• if p  is a prime appearing only as a single power in the prime decomposition of |G|, then all 
the Sylow p -subgroups of G  are conjugate, and hence isomorphic.

Presentations of Groups
12	 Presentations of Groups
Presentations of groups give a way of writing down a “minimal” amount of algebraic information which 
defines a group. Often it is relatively easy to write down a presentation of a group, but to deduce facts about 
a group from its presentation can sometimes involve deep mathematics. Notation: We will typically use 
1, rather than e , when referring to the identity of a group, because e  is sometimes used as a generator. 
12.1	
Introduction to Presentations
Recall that a subset X  of a group G  generates G, written G = ⟨X⟩, if for all g ∈G  there exist finitely 
many elements x1 . . . xn  of X  such that 
g = xε1
1 · · · xεn
n ,
where in each case εi  is either 1 or −1. Note that the xi  are not necessarily distinct and that the identity 
of G  is the special case where there are no xi . 
For example G  is cyclic if G = ⟨{x}⟩ for a single element x , and we usually just write G = ⟨x⟩. In 
this case, G  could be a finite cyclic group (if sn = 1G  for some n ) or an infinite cyclic group. 
Example 12.1 
1.	 Suppose that we wish to equationally define the finite cyclic group Z4, and we declare it to 
be “the” group G  generated by a single element s , and such that s4 = 1. We abbreviate this 
to 
G ∼= ⟨s|s4 = 1⟩
or more usually just 
G ∼= ⟨s|s4⟩.
The problem is that other groups satisfy this property as well. For instance Z2 is generated by 
a single element s  such that s4 = 1, and so is the trivial group, for that matter. So we want 
the above notation to define “the group which satisfies this and no other constraints”. 
2.	 Let D8 denote the dihedral group of order 8 (the group of symmetries of a square). This can 
easily be seen to be generated by a rotation r  through 90 degrees and a reflection s  in one 
of the diagonals of the square. In fact we have 
D8 = {1, r, r2, r3, s, rs, r2s, r3s},

where rs, r2s  and r3s  are reflections as well as s. So the following equations hold in D8. 
	
	
	
	
	
r4
=
1
(12.1)
	
	
	
	
	
s2
=
1
(12.2)
	
	
	
	
	
(rs)2
=
1
(12.3)
	
	
	
	
	
(r2s)2
=
1
(12.4)
	
	
	
	
	
(r3s)2
=
1
(12.5)
It is easy to show that (4) and (5) are consequences of (3). Thus a candidate for a “presentation” 
(definition in terms of generators and relations) is 
D8 ∼= ⟨r, s|r4, s2, (rs)2⟩.
3.	 Consider the symmetric group S3, which is the group of permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}. 
We have 
S3 = {1, (12), (23), (31), (123), (321)}
and some quick calculations show that if we define x = (12) and y = (23) then 
xy = (321), whence (xy)−1 = yx = (123), and xyx = (31). So S3 = ⟨x, y⟩. Now x  and y  
are transpositions, so x2 = y2 = 1 and xy  is a 3-cycle, so (xy)3 = 1. As in the last example 
we find that the facts that (yx)3 = 1 and (xyx)2 = 1 are redundant. So we have the following 
possibility for a presentation. 
S3 ∼= ⟨x, y|x2, y2, (xy)3⟩
On the other hand it is readily seen that if we let a = (12) and b = (123), then a  and b  also 
generate G  and the presentation we obtain this time is 
S3 ∼= ⟨a, b|a2, b3, (ab)2⟩.
Which of these is the “right” presentation? In fact they both are. We shall see that a group 
can have many different presentations, although in the next section we shall see that, with 
the definition we give, a given presentation gives rise to a unique group, up to isomorphism.

Alphabets and Words
We now define precisely what is meant by a presentation of a group 
Definition 12.2 A paired alphabet is a set X  together with two disjoint subsets X+ and X− of X , such 
that X+ ∪X−= X  and a bijection φ : X →X  such that φ(X+) = X−, φ(X−) = X+ and φ ◦φ  
is the identity map X →X. 
We write x−1 for φ(x) and x+1 for x . Note that if X  is finite then |X|  must be even. 
Definition 12.3 A word w  in X  is a finite sequence xε1
1 , . . . , xεn
n , where for each i, xi ∈X+ and εi  is 
1 or −1. 
We usually write w = xε1
1 · · · xεn
n  and L(w) = n , where L  stands for the length of w . A product x · · · x  
of m  x s is denoted xm , and x−m  is a corresponding product of x−1s. The inverse of w  is defined to 
be the word w−1 = x−ε1
n

. If v = yδ1
1 · · · yδm
m  is another word in X  then we define the (word) 
product wv  to be the word xε1
1 · · · xεn
n yδ1
1 · · · yδm
m . The empty word, i.e. the unique word of length 0, is 
denoted by ε . The set of all words in X  is denoted by X∗. 
Definition 12.4 Let X  be a paired alphabet. A presentation in X  is a pair (X, R) where R  is a set of 
words in X.

Presentations of Groups
Henceforth, we always use the notation ⟨X|R⟩ to denote the data (X, R). The elements of R  are 
called relators. 
We define the group presented by ⟨X|R⟩ as a set of equivalence classes of words. 
Let w  be a word in X. A simple operation on w  is an operation of one of the following types. By a 
subword of a word w  we mean a consecutive subsequence of w. For example, xyx  is a subword of 
xyxyx  but xxx  is not. 
1.	 Insert one of the words r ∈R, xx−1 or x−1x  for some x ∈X  or ε  between any two 
consecutive symbols of w  or before w  or after w . 
2.	 Delete a subword r ∈R , xx−1, x−1x  or ε  from w . 
Notice that these two operations are reverses of each other. 
If we can obtain a word w2 from a word w1 by applying a simple operation then we write w1 →w2. 
Definition 12.5 Let w1 and w2 be words in X . We write w1 ∼w2 if there exist finitely many words 
v1, . . . , vn  in X  such that 
w1 →v1 →· · · →vn →w2.
Proposition 12.6 ∼ is an equivalence relation on X∗. 
Proof. w →w  by inserting the empty word anywhere in w . Thus ∼ is reflexive. It is symmetric because 
if w1 ∼w2 then for some vi  we have 
w1 →v1 →· · · →vn →w2
and by applying the reverse of the corresponding simple operations we have 
w2 →vn →· · · →v1 →w1.
Hence w2 ∼w1. It remains to prove transitivity of ∼. Suppose that w1 ∼w2 and w2 ∼w3. Say that 
we have 
w1 →v1 →· · · →vn →w2

w2 →v′
1 →· · · →v′
m →w3.
Then by stringing these sets of operations together, 
w1 →v1 →· · · →vn →w2 →v′
1 →· · · →v′
m →w3,
which gives us w1 ∼w3. □ 
Lemma 12.7 Let w1,w2,w3 and w4 be words in X. If w1 ∼w2 and w3 ∼w4 then w1w3 ∼w2w4. 
Proof. Suppose that 
w1 →v1 →· · · →vn →w2
and 
w3 →v′
1 →· · · →v′
m →w4.
Then 
w1w3 →v1w3 →· · · →vnw3 →
w2w3

→w2w4.
□ 
Denote an equivalence class of words in ⟨X|R⟩ by [w] and define the product of two equivalence classes 
by the rule [w1][w2] = [w1w2]. By the previous lemma the product is well defined. 
Note that this construction is similar to that of a quotient group. This is no coincidence, as we shall see 
in the next section. 
Proposition 12.8 With the above product, the set of equivalence classes of words in X  becomes a group. 
Proof. Let [w1], [w2] and [w3] be equivalence classes of words in X. Then 
([w1][w2])[w3]
=
[w1w2][w3]
=
[(w1w2)w3]
=
[w1(w2w3)] (since the word product is associative)
=
[w1][w2w3]
=
[w1]([w2][w3]).

Hence the product of equivalence classes is associative. [ε] is clearly an identity for the product. For any 
class [w] we have [w]−1 = [w−1] because we can obtain [ε] from ww−1 by repeatedly deleting terms 
of the form xx−1. □

Von Dyck’s Theorem
From now on the notation ⟨X|R⟩ will refer to the above group. 
Let G = ⟨X|R⟩ and let H  be any group. If f  is a map from X  to H  then there is a map f ∗: X∗→H  
defined by 
f ∗(xε1

Proof. Define f ′([w]) = f ∗(w). We need to show that this is well defined, i.e. that whenever w1 ∼w2 we 
have f ∗(w1) = f ∗(w2). It suffices to show that if w1 →w2 then f ∗(w1) = f ∗(w2). There are several 
cases. We deal with the case where w2 arises from w1 via insertion of a relator and leave the other cases 
as an exercise for the reader. Suppose that w1 = vw  and w2 = vrw . Then 
f ∗(w2)
=
f ∗(vrw)
=
f ∗(v)f ∗(r)f ∗(w)
=
f ∗(v)1Hf ∗(w) (since f ∗(R) = {1H})
=
f ∗(vw)
=
f ∗(w1).
That f  is a homomorphism follows easily from the definition of the word product. □
Corollary 12.10 (von Dyck’s theorem) If G = ⟨X|R⟩, H = ⟨Y |S⟩ and f : X →Y ∗ satisfies 
f ∗(R) ⊂S  then f  extends to a homomorphism from G  to H. 
Proof. If f ∗(R) ⊂S  then f ∗(R) = {1H}  since all relators in S  are clearly equivalent to the identity 
of ⟨Y |S⟩ (we can delete them in a simple move). Now apply the previous lemma. □ 
Corollary 12.11 Every group is isomorphic to ⟨X|R⟩ for some X  and R . 
Proof. Let X = G  and let R  be the set of all words in X  which are equal to the identity in G . By 
lemma 12.9 there is a homomorphism f ′ : ⟨X|R⟩→G  which is clearly surjective. A typical element of 
⟨X|R⟩ is [g], where g ∈G . Suppose that f ′([g1]) = f ′([g2]). Then f ∗(g1) = f ∗(g2) which means that 
g1 = g2 and hence [g1] = [g2]. This shows that f ′  is also injective and hence it is an isomorphism. □
12.4	
Finitely Generated and Finitely Presented Groups
Recall that a group G  is finitely generated (f.g.) if it has finite generating set, i.e. a presentation ⟨X|R⟩ 
with X  finite. We say that G  is finitely presented (f.p.) if it has a presentation ⟨X|R⟩ with X  finite 
and R  finite. It is possible for a group to be finitely generated but not finitely presented. 
Example 12.12 We now show that the group 
G = ⟨r, s|r4, s2, (rs)2⟩
is isomorphic to D8. Let [w] ∈G  and delete all occurrences of rr−1, r−1r , ss−1 and s−1s  to obtain 
an equivalent word of the form 
w′ = rn1sm1rn2sm2 · · · rnksmkrnk+1

with each mi ̸= 0 and ni ̸= 0 except possibly when i = 1 or i = k + 1. We can assume all mi  are 
equal to 1 since we can replace s2 by ε , i.e. 
w′ ∼rn1srn2s · · · rnksrnk+1.
Now rsrs = 1 which implies that rs = s−1r−1. Since s2 = 1, s−1 = s  and we have rs = sr−1. This 
allows us to gather all the s  terms at the right hand side to show that w′ ∼rnsm  where m = 0 or 1. 
Since r4 = 1 we may also assume that 0 ⩽n ⩽3. This gives us eight words 1,r , r2, r3, s ,rs,r2s  
and r3s  which are the distinct elements of G  since no further reductions are possible. By lemma 12.9 
there is a homomorphism f ′ : G →D8. f ′  is injective as it maps each of the above words to a distinct 
element of D8. Since |G| = 8 = |D8|  it must also be surjective and is hence an isomorphism. 
Exercise 12.13 
1.	 Show that 
a)	 ⟨x, y|x2, y2, (xy)3⟩∼= S3 
b)	 ⟨a, b|a2, b3, (ab)2⟩∼= S3

4.	 Generalise further to obtain a presentation ⟨Xn|Rn⟩ of Sn , proving formally that

Dehn’s Fundamental Algorithmic Problems
In the previous section we constructed a “normal form” for G, which is a unique choice for all g ∈G , 
of a word representing g. This is closely related to the first of three fundamental problems posed by 
Dehn in 1912: 
1.	 The word problem: Given G = ⟨X|R⟩, does there exist an algorithm which takes a word 
w ∈X∗ as its input and after finitely many steps gives the output either “yes” or “no”, “yes” 
if the word is equal to the identity in G  and “no” otherwise. 
2.	 The conjugacy problem: Given G = ⟨X|R⟩, does there exist an algorithm which takes two 
words w1 and w2 in X  as its input and after finitely many steps give the output either “yes” 
or “no”, “yes” if the two elements are conjugate in G  (i.e. there exists an element g ∈G  
such that [w1] = g−1[w2]g ) and “no” otherwise.

3.	 The isomorphism problem: Given a class C  of groups, does there exist an algorithm which 
takes as its input two presentations ⟨X1|R1⟩ and ⟨X2|R2⟩ of groups in C  and after 
finitely many steps gives the output either “yes”, the two groups are isomorphic, or “no”, they 
are not. 
If the algorithm in any of these problems exists then we say that the problem is solvable for the given 
group or class of groups. The precise mathematical definition of an algorithm depends on the notion of 
a Turing machine and is beyond the scope of this book. 
Note that the word problem for G  is a special case of the conjugacy problem. There are deep theorems 
of Novikov and Boone which assert that 
1.	 There exists a finitely presented group with unsolvable word problem (and hence unsolvable 
conjugacy problem). 
2.	 The isomorphism problem is unsolvable for the class of finitely presented groups. 
In fact there is no algorithm which takes as its input a finite presentation ⟨X|R⟩ and after finitely many 
steps tells us either “yes” if the group it presents is trivial or “no” if it is not. The following exercise may 
give you some appreciation of this fact. 
Exercise 12.14 Show that the group presented by ⟨a, b|ab2 = b3a, ba2 = a3b⟩ is trivial.

Free Groups
13	 Free Groups
Free groups are groups with the simplest types of presentations, in that they have presentations without 
any relators. Every group is a quotient of a free group, because by adding relators to form a presentation, 
we are really forming quotient groups. 
13.1	
Reduced Words and Free Groups
Let ∅ denote the empty set.
Definition 13.1 A group G  is said to be free on a set X  if G ∼= ⟨X|∅⟩. G is said to be free if it is free on 
some set. 
We also write G = F(X), meaning that G  is free on X. If X  is finite then we say that G  has rank n , 
where n = |X+| , and write Fn  for F(X), usually for n ⩾2. 
The equivalence relation we introduced in the last section now becomes w1 →w2 if we can obtain w2 
from w1 by inserting or deleting a word of the form xx−1, x−1x  (x ∈X ) or ε , and if we can obtain 
w2 from w1 by finitely many of these operations. 
Let w ∈X∗. By deleting all occurrences of xx−1 or x−1x , we obtain a representative wr of [w] called 
a reduced word. We shall write X∗
r  for all reduced words in the paired alphabet X. 
Exercise 13.2 Show that every element of the free group F(X) is represented by a unique reduced 
word in X. 
Example 13.3 
1.	 Let X = {x, x−1} . A reduced word in X  is a word of the form xn for some n ∈Z . These 
words all represent distinct elements of F(X) and it is easy to see that F(X) ∼= Z . 
2.	 The free group F2 of rank 2 is a more interesting group. Let X = {a±1, b±1} . Reduced 
words of length two in F(X) are a2, ab , ab−1, b2, ba , ba−1, a−2, a−1b , a−1b−1, b−2
, b−1a  and b−1a−1. These all represent distinct elements of F2. Don’t confuse F2 with 
Z2 = Z ⊕Z , the direct product of two inifinte cyclic groups. This has presentation 
⟨a, b|aba−1b−1⟩
and is abelian. By looking at the above list of words we see that F2 is definitely not abelian. 
For instance ab  is not equal to ba.

Free Groups
The following is sometimes taken as the definition of a free group.
Theorem 13.4 Let X  be a set and G  be a group. Then every map f : X →G  extends to a unique 
homomorphism θ : F(X) →G. 
Proof. There is a homomorphism θ : F(X) →G  by von Dyck’s theorem, whose conditions are satisfied 
vacuously. Suppose that θ′ : F(X) →G  is another homomorphism which extends f. Let xn1
1 · · · xnm
m  
be a typical element of F(X). Then 
θ′(xn1
1 · · · xnm
m )
=
θ′(x1)n1 · · · θ′(xm)nm
=
θ(x1)n1 · · · θ(xm)nm
=
θ(xn1
1 · · · xnm
m )
And so θ′ = θ . □
Corollary 13.5 Every group is isomorphic to a quotient of a free group. 
Proof. Let G  have the presentation ⟨X|R⟩ (recall that every group has a presentation). Now the inclusion 
map f : X →G  given by f(x) = x  extends to a homomorphism f ′ : F(X) →G. X  generates G  
so f ′  is surjective. Thus, by the first isomorphism theorem, F(X)/ ker(f) ∼= G. □
13.2	
Normal Closure
The following exercise investigates the structure of ker(f) as in the last proof. 
Exercise 13.6 Let H  be any group and let Y  be a subset of H . Then the normal closure of Y  in H  is 
defined to be the subgroup 
⟨h−1yh|y ∈Y, h ∈H⟩
of H , written ⟨⟨Y ⟩⟩H . 
1.	 Show that if N  is any normal subgroup of H  containing Y  then ⟨⟨Y ⟩⟩H ⊆N. 
2.	 Show that ⟨⟨Y ⟩⟩H  is equal to the intersection of all normal subgroups of H  which contain 
Y . 
3.	 Suppose that G = ⟨X|R⟩ and that G ∼= F(X)/K. Denote by [R] the subset 
{[r]|r ∈R}
of F(X). Show that K = ⟨⟨[R]⟩⟩F .

Free Groups
Exercise 13.7 Show that if G  is a group and H  and K  are subgroups of finite index of G  then H ∩K  
has finite index in G. 
13.3	
Torsion Free Groups
A group G  is said to be torsion free if the only element of finite order in G  is eG , the identity of G.
Theorem 13.8 Free groups are torsion free. 
Proof. Let F  be free on a set X  and let w = xε1
1 · · · xεn
n  be a nonempty word in X∗
r , where each 
εi ∈{−1, 1}  and each xi ∈X. If ((xn)εn)−1 ̸= xε1
1  then wn ∈X∗
r  and 
wn = (xε1
1 · · · xεn
n )(xε1
1 · · · xεn
n ) · · · (xε1
1 · · · xεn
n )
which is not the empty word. 
On the other hand, if ((xn)εn)−1 = xε1
1  then there exists j < n/2 such that w = u−1vu, where 
u−1 = xε1
1 · · · xεj
j , u = (xεj
j )−1 · · · (xε1
1 )−1 and v  is reduced. Then as w  is nonempty, so is v  and v  
has infinite order by the first case. Since wn = u−1vnu  is a reduced word of length 2j + nL(v), wn  
is never trivial in F  and has infinite order. □
Exercise 13.9 This shows that subgroups of finitely generated groups need not necessarily be finitely 
generated. Let 
θ : F2 = ⟨a, b⟩→Z = ⟨x⟩
be the homomorphism induced by mapping a →x  and b →x. Show that ker(θ) is not finitely 
generated. (Hint: Let x1, . . . , xk  be arbitrary elements of F2 and find an element of F2 not in 
⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩.) 
The direct product F2 × F2 is an interesting group. It can be shown that F2 × F2 has uncountably many 
non-isomorphic subgroups, including subgroups which are finitely generated but not finitely presented 
[2]. Such a group is called incoherent (a group G  is coherent if, on the other hand, every finitely generated 
subgroup of G  is finitely presented).

Free Groups
The theory of free groups can be surprisingly deep and is still an active area of mathematical research. It 
is a well known theorem that every subgroup of a free group is free. Furthermore, if H  and K  are non-
trivial finitely generated subgroups of a free group F, then their intersection is also finitely generated. It 
was an open problem since 1956 that 
rank H ∩K −1 ≤(rank H −1)(rank K −1)
This is an extremely difficult problem known as the Hanna Neumann Conjecture. A full proof of this 
result was announced in 2011 by Mineyev[10].

Abelian Groups
14	 Abelian Groups
In this section we look at abelian groups and some constructions related to abelian parts of groups. 
We will apply these to free groups to show that free groups of different rank are non-isomorphic. A 
well known structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups is given, and we mention various 
generalisations of abelian groups. 
14.1	
Commutator Subgroups and Abelianisations
We now aim to show that Fn  is not isomorphic to Fm unless n = m . This will involve introducing 
one or two new concepts.
Definition 14.1 Let G  be a group and let g  and h  be in G. The commutator of g  and h  is 
g−1h−1gh , written [g, h]. The commutator subgroup of G, written G′, is 
⟨[g, h] | g, h ∈G⟩.
Proposition 14.2 Let G  be a group. Then 
1.	 G′  is a normal subgroup of G. 
2.	 G/G′  is abelian. Moreover, if H  is any normal subgroup of G, then G/H  is abelian if and 
only if G′ ⊆H. 
Proof. 
1.	 Clearly G′  is a subgroup of G. So we only have to show that it is normal. First observe that 
for any g , h  and k  in G  we have 
g−1[h, k]g
=
g−1h−1k−1hkg
=
g−1h−1gg−1k−1gg−1hgg−1kg
=
[g−1hg, g−1kg].
Now let g ∈G  and g′ ∈G′. Since g′ ∈G′  we can write it as a product of powers of 
commutators, say 
g′ = [g1, h1]n1 · · · [gr, hr]nr.
Then we have 
g−1g′g
=
g−1[g1, h1]n1 · · · [gr, hr]nrg
=
(g−1[g1, h1]g)n1 · · · (g−1[gr, hr]g)nr
=
[g−1g1g, g−1h1g]n1 · · · [g−1grg, g−1hrg] ∈G′.
So G′  is a normal subgroup of G  as required.

Abelian Groups
2.	 Suppose that H  is a normal subgroup of G  and let g1 and g2 be in G. Then 
g1g2H = g2g1H  if and only if [g1, g2]H = H , i.e. if and only if [g1, g2] ∈H. Thus G/H  
is abelian if and only if G′ ⊂H . 
□ 
Thus G/G′  is the “largest abelian quotient” of G. It is called the abelianisation of G, and is written Gab. 
The commutator subgroup is an example of what is called a verbal subgroup. If w1, . . . , wn  are 
words in a paired alphabet X  then the verbal subgroup generated by w1, . . . , wn  is the subgroup 
⟨w1(G), . . . , wn(G)⟩ (i.e. the subgroup generated by all elements of G  obtained by replacing each 
x±1 in each w  by g±1 for some element g  of G). Another example is the subgroup of G  generated 
by nth powers Gn = ⟨gn | g ∈G⟩. 
Exercise 14.3 
1.	 Show that if V  is a verbal subgroup of a group G  then for all homomorphisms θ : G →G  
(called endomorphisms of G ) we have θ(V ) ⊆V . A subgroup with the above property is 
called fully characteristic, and characteristic if it is invariant under at least all automorphisms 
of G. Show that both of these properties generalise the idea of a normal subgroup. Deduce 
that verbal subgroups are normal. 
2.	 Show that if F  is a free group and H  is a subgroup of F  such that θ(H) ⊆H  for all 
endomorphisms θ  of F  then H  is verbal. 
14.2	
Free Abelian Groups
Definition 14.4 A free abelian group is a group which is isomorphic to a direct product of (zero or more) 
infinite cyclic groups. 
For example, the free abelian group of rank n  is the group Zn = Z ⊕· · · ⊕Z  with n  free factors. This 
has a presentation 
⟨x1, . . . xn | [xi, xj] for all 1 ⩽i < j ⩽n⟩.
Before giving a presentation of the abelianisation of a group, we have the following general theorem 
which shows us how to present quotient groups. 
Theorem 14.5 Let G ∼= ⟨X | R⟩, let W  be a set of words in X  and let N  be the normal closure ⟨⟨W⟩⟩G  
(see exercise 13.6). Then G/N ∼= ⟨X | R ∪W⟩.

Abelian Groups
Proof. Define p : X →G/N  via p(x) = xN. Denote ⟨X | R ∪W⟩ by Q . If r ∈R  then [r] = 1Q  
so p∗([r]) = N = 1G/N  and if w ∈W  then p∗([w]) = N = 1G/N  since [w] ∈N . So by Lemma 12.9 
there is a homomorphism 
p′ : Q →G
N .
Since G = ⟨X⟩, p′(X) generates G/N  and p′  is surjective. To show that p′  is injective we show that 
ker(p′) = {1Q}. Suppose that [k] ∈ker(p′). Then p′([k]) = 1G/N = N = ⟨⟨W⟩⟩G . By definition of 
p′ , [k] ∈N. So there exist gi ∈G  and wi ∈W ±1 such that 
k ∼g−1
1 [w1]g1g−1
2 [w2]g2 · · · g−1
r [wr]gr.
But in ⟨X | R ∪W⟩ we can delete all words wi  and cancel each g−1
i
gi  term to obtain k ∼ε . Thus 
[k] = 1Q  and p′  is injective and an isomorphism. □ 
Proposition 14.6 Let G = ⟨X | R⟩. Then 
Gab ∼= ⟨X | R ∪{[x1, x2] | x1, x2 ∈X}⟩.

Abelian Groups
Proof. G′  is a normal subgroup of G  so ⟨⟨G′⟩⟩G = G′ . Thus Gab = G/G′  has a presentation 
Gab ∼= ⟨X | R ∪{[g1, g2] | g1, g2 ∈G}⟩.
by the previous theorem. However it is easy to see that the set of relators {[g1, g2] | g1, g2 ∈G}  can be 
derived from the set of relators {[x1, x2] | x1, x2 ∈X}. □ 
Thus for all n , (Fn)ab ∼= Zn.
Theorem 14.7 Fn ∼= Fm  if and only if m = n . 
Proof. It is clear that if m = n  then Fn ∼= Fm . Conversely if Fn ∼= Fm  then F ′
n ∼= F ′
m  and hence 
(Fn)ab ∼= (Fm)ab , i.e. Zn ∼= Zm . But then 
Zn
2Zn

⟨2g | g ∈Zn⟩

2Zm
which means that Zn
2 ∼= Zm
2 . But Zn
2  is a vector space of dimension n  over the finite field Z2 and if 
Zn
2 ∼= Zm
2  then their dimensions are equal. Thus m = n. □
14.3	
Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
The structure of finitely generated abelian groups is very simple, as the following theorem shows:
Theorem 14.8 If G  is an abelian group that can be generated by n  elements then G  is isomorphic to a 
direct product of m ⩽n  cyclic subgroups. 
Proof. Omitted as it is quite long – the idea is to mimic ideas from linear algebra, and to formulate the 
concept of a basis in finitely generated abelian groups. □ 
14.4	
Generalisations of Abelian Groups
Two important generalisations of abelian groups are soluble (or solvable) groups and nilpotent groups. 
We will only give a rough idea of these here, but if you want to read more there is some recommended 
reading in chapter 19.

Abelian Groups
When we form the commutator subgroup of a group, we can repeat the process. In general if A  and 
B  are subsets of a group G, write 
[A, B] = ⟨{[a, b]|a ∈A, b ∈B}⟩.
That is, the subgroup generated by all of the commutators shown. Let G(0) = G, G1 = G′ = [G, G] 
and define G(n) = [G(n−1), G(n−1)] for all n. Clearly G(0) = 1 iff G  is trivial and G(1) = 1 iff G  is 
abelian. If G(n) = 1 for some n  then we say that G  is soluble. 
Solubility was one of the first important concepts defined in group theory, by Evariste Galois, who 
used the concept to show that it is not possible to solve a quintic equation by a general formula using 
radicals (roots). This had already been proved slightly earlier by Niels Abel (after whom abelian groups 
are named) but the ideas of Galois were further reaching: we can define a symmetry group of such an 
equation and it turns out we can solve by radicals if and only if this group is soluble. 
In another generalisation of abelian groups we write γ1(G) = G  and γn(G) = [γ(n−1)(G), G]. The 
series of subgroups so obtained is called the lower central series of G. If for some n  we have γn = 1 
then we say that G  is nilpotent. Nilpotent groups have also been extensively studied. They enjoy strong 
properties – for example every subgroup and quotient group of a nilpotent group is solvable. They also 
have some of the properties of abelian groups. For instance, the set of finite order elements forms a 
subgroup (see exercise 4.2 for the abelian case).

Transforming Presentations
15	 Transforming Presentations
Tietze transformations give us a way of passing between different presentations of the same group. Given 
two such presentations, we can always find a finite sequence of these transformations which carries one 
presentation to the other. 
15.1	
Tietze Transformations
Example 15.1 
1.	 We saw in section 1.2 that 
S3 ∼= ⟨x, y | x2, y2, (xy)3⟩.
Let a = x  and let b = xy . We can then add the generators a  and b  to the presentation, 
provided that we also add as relators what they are equal to as words in the other generators. 
This gives 
S3 ∼= ⟨x, y, a, b | x2, y2, (xy)3, xa−1, xyb−1⟩.
Now, since x  is given as an expression in terms of the other generators via the relator xa−1 
we may replace x  by a  in the other relators and delete x  and the relator xa−1. This gives 
S3 ∼= ⟨y, a, b | a2, y2, (ay)3, ayb−1⟩.
We may also solve for y ; y = a−1b  from the relator ayb−1. So we can replace y  by a−1b  in 
the other relators and delete y  and the final relator. Hence 
S3 ∼= ⟨a, b | a2, (a−1b)2, b3⟩.
Finally we may add the relator (ab)2 as it is a consequence of the relators a2 and (a−1b)2. We 
may then delete (a−1b)2 as it is a consequence of a2 and (ab)2. So we arrive at the second 
presentation of S3 given in section 1.2: 
S3 ∼= ⟨a, b | a2, b3, (ab)2⟩.
2.	 We now show that 
⟨x, y | x2 = y3⟩∼= ⟨a, b | aba = bab⟩.

Transforming Presentations
Start with the second presentation and add the generators x  and y  and the relators x = aba  
and y = ab  to obtain 
⟨a, b, x, y | aba = bab, x = aba, y = ab⟩.
Noting that x2 = y3 is a consequence of these relators we change the presentation to 
⟨a, b, x, y | aba = bab, x = aba, y = ab, x2 = y3⟩.
Solving for a  and b  we have a = xy−1 and b = a−1y = yx−1y . Deleting a  and b  and the 
relators we used to solve for them we have 
⟨x, y | x2 = y3⟩.
Incidentally, by letting y = bab−1 in the second presentation we can also show that this group 
is isomorphic to 
⟨a, b, y | y = bab−1, aya−1 = b⟩
which is the presentation of the trefoil knot group from chapter 12. 
The Tietze transformations of a finite presentation are as follows. 
1.	 If w  is a word in X  such that w ∼ε  in ⟨X | R⟩ then change 
⟨X | R⟩→⟨X | R ∪{w}⟩.
2.	 If w  is a word in X  such that w ∼ε  in ⟨X | R⟩ then change 
⟨X | R ∪{w}⟩→⟨X | R⟩.
3.	 If w  is a word in X  and y /∈X  then change 
⟨X | R⟩→⟨X ∪{y} | R ∪{y = w}⟩.
4.	 If y /∈X  and y = w  is a relator, where w  is a word in X, then change 
⟨X ∪{y} | R ∪{y = w}⟩→⟨X | R′⟩
where R′  is the set of relators R  with every occurrence of y  replaced by w.

Note that the opposite of a transformation of type 2 is one of type 1 and the opposite of a transformation 
of type 4 is one of type 3 followed by finitely many of type 1 and finitely many of type 2. 
We now analyse the Tietze transformations in the examples above. In the first example we performed two 
type 3 transformations, a type 4, another type 4, a type 1 then a type 2. In the second we performed 
two of type 3 followed by a type 1, a type 2 then two of type 4.
15.2	
Properties of Tietze Transformations
Theorem 15.2 The Tietze transformations do not affect the isomorphism type of the group presented. 
Proof. Let G = ⟨X | R⟩ and H = ⟨X | R ∪{w}⟩. By von Dyck’s theorem we may construct a 
homomorphism p′ : H →G  extending the map p : X →X  defined by p(x) = x  for all x ∈X . It 
is surjective as X  generates G  and its kernel is {1H}  because if p∗(v) = v ∼ε  in G  then we can 
reduce v  in H  to ε  by inserting or deleting a word in R  or one of the form xx−1, x−1x . Adding 
another relator doesn’t affect this so v ∼ε  in H. Since ker(p′) = {1H} , p′  is injective and hence an 
isomorphism. This shows invariance under transformations of types 1 and 2 of the isomorphism type 
of the group presented.

Transforming Presentations
It remains to show invariance under type 3 and invariance under type 4 will then follow because of the 
nature of its opposite transformation. Let G = ⟨X | R⟩ and H = ⟨X ∪{y} | R ∪{y = w}⟩ where 
y /∈X. Again there is a homomorphism p′ : G →H  induced by mapping p(x) to x  for all x ∈X. It 
is surjective because (X ∪{y})∗= (X ∪{w})∗= X∗ so X  generates H . It is also injective since if 
p∗(x) ∼ε  in H  we can also reduce x  to ε  in G  since y  is equal to a word in X. Hence it is bijective 
and an isomorphism. □
Theorem 15.3 Given two finite presentations of a group G  there exists a finite sequence of Tietze 
transformations which changes one presentation into the other. 
Proof. Suppose that 
G
∼=
⟨x1, . . . , xn | r1, . . . , rp⟩
∼=
⟨y1, . . . , ym | s1, . . . , sq⟩
Let X = {x1, . . . , xn}  and y = {y1, . . . , ym} . Since X  generates G  we may write 
y1 = w1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , ym = wm(x1, . . . , xn)
where wi(x1, . . . , xn) are all words in X. By m  moves of type 3 we can change to the following 
presentation. 
⟨x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym | r1, . . . , rp, y1 = w1, . . . , ym = wm⟩.
We can now use q  moves of type 1 to add s1, . . . , sq  to the list of relators, since each of these is 
equivalent to ε  in G . This results in 
⟨x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym | r1, . . . , rp, s1, . . . , sq, y1 = w1, . . . , ym = wm⟩.
Now since Y  generates G  we can write 
x1 = v1(y1, . . . , ym), . . . , xn = vn(y1, . . . , ym)
where vi(y1, . . . , ym) are words in Y . Using moves of type 1 we can add these to the presentation to 
obtain 
⟨x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym | r1, . . . ,
rp
, s1, . . . , sq, x1 = v1, . . . ,
xn
= vn, y1 = w1, . . . , ym = wm⟩.

Transforming Presentations
Now we could equally have obtained this presentation from the second of the initial presentations. Thus 
the inverse of the moves we would have done in order to make this transformation will now complete 
the transformation of the first presentation to the second. (If these are written out explicitly it is seen 
that moves of type 2 and 4 are also used.) □ 
It can be shown that the solvability of the word problem is not affected by Tietze transformations. Thus 
a corollary of the previous theorem is that the solvability of the word problem only depends on a group 
G  and not a particular finite presentation of G.

Free Products
16	 Free Products
Free products are a generalisation of free groups and a very important construction in group theory. A 
free group of rank 2 is a free product of two infinite cyclic groups. We define free products of arbitrary 
groups and discuss some of their properties. 
16.1	
Free Products
Recall that the direct product G = H × K  of two groups H  and K  satisfies the following (really we 
mean H × {1K}  when we write H  and we mean {1H} × K  when we write K). 
1.	 G = ⟨H, K⟩ 
2.	 H ∩K = {1G}. 
3.	 For all h ∈H  and for all k ∈K  we have hk = kh . 
There are many other notions of “product” in group theory. Usually the third condition is weakened. 
The first type of product we study, the free product, satisfies the first two conditions but not the third. 
Later we shall study another type of product in which the second condition is usually also weakened.
Definition 16.1 Let A = ⟨XA | RA⟩ and B = ⟨XB | RB⟩ be groups. Then the free product of A  
and B , written A ∗B, is the group with presentation 
⟨XA ∪XB | RA ∪RB⟩
Note that we are assuming that XA  and XB  are disjoint sets, and the same for RA  and RB. 
Example 16.2 
1.	 Let A = ⟨a |⟩ and B = ⟨b |⟩. Then A ∼= Z, B ∼= Z  and A ∗B ∼= F2. More generally, 
Fn−1 ∗Z ∼= Fn  for all n. 
2.	 Let A = Z2 = ⟨a | a2⟩ and let B = Z2 = ⟨b | b2⟩. Suppose that G = A ∗B, i.e G  is the 
group with presentation 
⟨a, b | a2, b2⟩.
A general element of G  is of the form

but since a2 = b2 = 1 we can write it as 
(a)baba · · · aba(b)
and this is a normal form for G . G  arises as a group of isometries of the real line R . (Recall 
that an isometry f : R →R  is a bijection from R  to R  such that distances between points 
are preserved, i.e. for all x  and y  in R  we have |f(x) −f(y)| = |x −y|. It is easy to see that 
such a map is determined by the images of 2 points.) In fact G  is the group of isometries of 
R  which fix Z . Let a  be reflection of R  in the point 0 and let b  be reflection of R  in the 
point 1
2. Then a2 = b2 = 1. We can use von Dyck’s theorem to set up an isomorphism between 
G  and the group of isometries of R  generated by a  and b. This is a good exercise, but in this 
example we will only describe some of the products of a  and b. 
 
We have 
ab(0) = b(a(0)) = b(0) = 1
and 
ab(1) = b(a(1)) = b(−1) = 2
Hence ab  is the (infinite order) translation of R one unit to the right. ba = (ab)−1 since a  
and b  both have order 2. So ba  is the translation of R  one unit to the left. 
aba(0) = a(ab(0)) = a(1) = −1
and 
aba(1) = a(ab(1)) = a(2) = −2
Thus aba  is reflection in the point −1
2. Similarly, 
bab(0) = b(ba(0)) = b(−1) = 2
and 
bab(1) = b(ba(1)) = b(0) = 1

So bab  is reflection in the point 1. We can continue to obtain all isometries of R  which fix 
Z . Words of even length correspond to translations and words of odd length correspond to 
reflections. 
This group can be considered as the symmetry group of an infinitely many sided polygon. For 
this reason it is known as the infinite dihedral group and is denoted D∞. 
Exercise 16.3 Show that D∞∼= ⟨s, t | tst−1 = s−1⟩. 
Note that we need to show that the definition of the direct product does not depend on the chosen 
presentations of A  and B. This will be proven later.
16.2	
A Normal Form for Free Products
Theorem 16.4 Let G = A ∗B. Then for all g ∈G, g  can be written uniquely as a product a1b1 · · · anbn  
where ai ∈A  for all i , bi ∈B  for all i , ai ̸= 1G  for all i ̸= 1  and bn ̸= 1G  for all i ̸= n. 
Note that we can clearly write every element of G  as above. The point is that the expression is unique.

Proof. This is analogous to the case for free groups, where we used the van der Waerden trick. Let 
G = A ∗B  where A = ⟨XA | RB⟩ and B = ⟨XB | RB⟩. Assume that RA  contains all words of 
the form xx−1 and x−1x  where x ∈XA , and that RB  is also defined to include such words. Let 
R = RA ∪RB  and X = XA ∪XB. Let WG  denote the set of all words of the form a1b1 · · · anbn 
where ai ∈A  and bi ∈B  for all i  and a1 and br are the only letters which may take the value 1G. 
For all x ∈X±  we construct a bijection fx : WG →WG  as follows. fx  is rather complicated to write 
down. If bn = 1 then fx  is defined analogously. By composition we extend f  to a map from X∗ to 
WG  via the following rule, where w = xn1
1 · · · xnr
r  is a word in (XA ∪XB)∗. 
fw(v) = (fxr)nr(v) o · · · o (fx1)n1(v)
It is easily checked that fr  is the identity for all r ∈R  and hence by von Dyck’s theorem there is a 
homomorphism induced. Now suppose that 
g = a1b1 · · · anbn = a′
1b′
1 · · · a′
mb′
m
Then by construction, 
fg(1) = a1b1 · · · anbn = a′
1b′
1 · · · a′

m
and both words must be equal since fg is well defined. □ 
Exercise 16.5 Show that if the word problem is solvable in groups A  and B  then it is solvable in A ∗B.

The Universal Property of Free Products
The following theorem is called a “universal property”. The terminology comes from a branch of 
mathematics called category theory, in which properties involving commutative diagrams are one of 
the fundamental objects of study. 
Proposition 16.6 Let H  be any group, let G = A ∗B  and let f : A →H  and g : B →H  be 
homomorphisms. Then there is a unique homomorphism φ : G →H  such that for all a ∈A , φ(a) = f(a) 
and for all b ∈B , φ(b) = g(b). 
Note that technically we mean that φ  satisfies φ o iA = f  and φ o iB = g , where iA : A →G  and 
iB : B →G  are the inclusion maps.

Proof. Let g ∈G , where g = a1b1 · · · anbn. Define 
φ(g) = f(a1)g(b1) · · · f(an)g(bn).
Clearly, φ(a) = f(a) for all a ∈A  and φ(b) = g(b). The map φ  is well defined by uniqueness 
of the normal form. Suppose that g = a1b1 · · · anbn, where ai ∈A  and bi ∈B  for each i  and 
g′ = a′
1b′
1 · · · a′

Then

=
φ(g)φ(g′)
(Note that above we allow a1 = 1G , bn = 1G , a′
1 = 1G  and b′
m = 1G). Thus φ  is a homomorphism.
Uniqueness of φ  follows because since A  and B  generate G, φ  is determined by φ(A) and φ(B). □
16.4	
Independence of Presentation
We now show that, up to isomorphism, A ∗B  does not depend on the presentations of A  and B . Let 
A ∼= ⟨XA | RA⟩∼= ⟨X′
A | R′
A⟩ and B ∼= ⟨XB | RB⟩∼= ⟨X′
B | R′

and G′ ∼= ⟨X′

A ∪R′
B⟩. If f ′
A : A →G′  is given by f ′
A(a) = a  for all a ∈A  and f ′
B : B →G′  
is given by f ′
B(b) = b  for all b ∈B  then let φ : G →G′  be the unique homomorphism such that for 
all a ∈A , φ(a) = f ′
A(a) and for all b ∈B, φ(b) = f ′
B(b). Similarly, if fA  and fB  are the analogous 
homomorphisms from A  and B  to G  and ψ : G →G′  is the analogous unique homomorphism, 
then ψ o φ : G →G  and id : G →G  are both homomorphisms χ : G →G  such that for all 
a ∈A , fA(a) = χ(a) and for all b ∈B, fB(b) = χ(b). By uniqueness of this homomorphism, 
ψ o φ = id : G →G. Similarly, φ o ψ  is the identity map. Thus φ  is an isomorphism with inverse ψ . 
Exercise 16.7 Let A  and B  be groups with 1A ̸= a ∈A  and 1B ̸= b ∈B . Let G = A ∗B. Show that 
G  is infinite by showing that aba−1b−1 has infinite order in A ∗B. Use this fact to show also that the 
centre Z(G) is trivial.

Decomposability
Exercise 16.8 Show that if A  and B  are both nontrivial groups and G ∼= A ∗B  then there are no 
nontrivial groups H  and K  with G ∼= H × K. (Hint: Choose nontrivial elements a ∈A  and b ∈B  
and consider the centraliser CG(ab)).

Free Products
We say that a group G  is freely decomposable if it can be written as a free product of nontrivial groups. 
Otherwise it is said to be freely indecomposable. We have similar notions of a directly decomposable and 
a directly indecomposable group. The above exercise shows that a freely decomposable group is directly 
indecomposable and that a directly decomposable group is freely indecomposable. Thus, for example, 
Z ⊕Z  is freely indecomposable and F2 is directly indecomposable.

Free Products With Amalgamation
17	 Free Products With 
Amalgamation
Free products with amalgamation generalise free products. In a free product with amalgamation we have 
two groups A  and B  with an isomorphic copy of the same subgroup C  and we form a group in which 
the two groups appear as subgroups such that the two copies of C  are joined together. In the case of a 
free product the subgroup C  is the identity subgroup of both A  and B. 
17.1	
Free Products with Amalgamation
Recall that the free product G = A ∗B  of two groups A  and B  satisfied G = ⟨A, B⟩ and 
A ∩B = {1G}. Suppose that the group C  appears as a common subgroup of the groups A  and B. 
In this section we construct a product A ∗C B  which satisfies G = ⟨A, B⟩ and A ∩B = C. The free 
product is thus a special case where C  is the trivial group. 
Since C  may appear as a subgroup of A  and B  in different ways, we must formally specify injective 
homomorphisms f : C →A  and g : C →B. This should really appear in the notation as A ∗f,g
C B  
but the maps are often omitted from the notation when they are clear from the context. 
Definition 17.1 Let A = ⟨XA | RA⟩ and B = ⟨XB | RB⟩ be groups. Suppose that XC  is a generating 
set of C  and we are given injective homomorphisms f : C →A  and g : C →B. Then the free product 
with amalgamation 
A ∗f,g
C B
is the group presented by 
⟨XA ∪XB | RA ∪RB ∪{f(x) = g(x) | x ∈XC}⟩
As in the definition of a free product, we understand that XA  and XB  are disjoint. 
Example 17.2 
1.	 A ∗B = A ∗{1} B  
2.	 Let A = ⟨a⟩, B = ⟨b⟩ and C = ⟨c⟩ be infinite cyclic groups. Take the homomorphisms 
f : C →A  given by f(c) = a2 and g : C →B  given by g(c) = b3. Then 
A ∗f,g
C B = ⟨a, b | a2 = b3⟩. This is an interesting infinite group. In the subject of knot 
theory, every knot has a group associated with it. This one is associated with a trefoil knot.

3.	 Let A = F(x, y) and let B = ⟨b⟩ and C = ⟨c⟩ be infinite cyclic groups. If f : C →A  is 
given by f(c) = x  and g : C →B  is given by g(c) = b  then 
A ∗f,g
C B = ⟨x, y, b | x = b⟩∼= ⟨x, y |⟩∼= F2
This is a trivial free product with amalgamation. 
4.	 Let A = ⟨a | a6⟩∼= Z6, B = ⟨b | b6⟩∼= Z6 and C = ⟨c | c3⟩∼= Z3. If f : C →A  is given 
by f(c) = a2 and g : C →B  is given by g(c) = b2 then

Lemma 17.4 If ψ : K →H  is a homomorphism of groups and N  is a normal subgroup of K  with 
N ⩽ker ψ  then there is a homomorphism φ : K/N →H  defined by φ(kN) = ψ(k).

ψ(k1k2)

=
φ(k1N)φ(k2N)
but the point is that φ  is well defined. If k1N = k2N  then k1k−1

k1k−1

2 ) = 1, i.e. ψ(k1)ψ(k2)−1 = 1 which means that ψ(k1) = ψ(k2). □

Proof. Let D  be as in the statement of the theorem. Define the maps h : A →D  by h(a) = aN  and 
k : B →D  by k(b) = bN. (Technically, if we let iA  be the inclusion map of A  in A ∗B  and let 
iB  be the inclusion map of B  in A ∗B  then we mean h(a) = iA(a)N  and k(b) = iB(b)N .) Let 
H  be an arbitrary group, and let p : A →H  and q : B →H  be arbitrary homomorphisms. Take 
ψ : A ∗B →H  to be the homomorphism with ψ|A = p  and ψ|B = q . N  is contained in ker ψ  
since if c ∈XC  then ψ(f(c)g(c)−1) = p(f(c))q(g(c))−1 = 1 since p(f(c)) = q(g(c)). By the previous 
lemma, there is a homomorphism induced from D  to N  by φ(aN) = ψ(a) and φ(bN) = ψ(b). The 
homomorphism ψ  is unique since D  is generated by {aN | a ∈A}  and {bN | b ∈B} , and since

In particular, when f  and g  are injective, the pushout is a free product with amalgamation. 
Corollary 17.6 Free products with amalgamation are independent of presentations 
Free products with amalgamation have an important application in topology. In topology, a group can be 
associated with a topological space X  satisfying a certain condition called path-connectedness. This is 
called the fundamental group of X. If X  can be written as A ∪B  where A ∩B = C  and these pieces 
are path connected and their fundamental groups inject into that of X  then the fundamental group 
is the free product of that of A  and B , amalgamated on the subgroup C . This is called van Kampen’s 
Theorem. It basically says that pushouts in topology are mapped to pushouts in group theory by the 
fundamental group. A good reference for this material is [9].

HNN Extensions
18	 HNN Extensions
In the final section of this book we look at a construction which is closely related to free products with 
amalgamation, but where a subgroup appears twice as different isomorphic copies of the same group, 
and we form a new group in which these copies become nontrivially conjugate. 
18.1	
HNN Extensions
Definition 181 Let A = ⟨XA | RA⟩ be a group and let B  and C  be subgroups of A  which are 
isomorphic via an isomorphism θ : B →C . Let XB  be a generating set of B  and let t  be a letter which 
is not in XA . Then the HNN Extension of A  along B  and C  with respect to θ  is the group 
A∗θ
B,C = ⟨XA ∪{t} | RA ∪{t−1bt = θ(b) | b ∈XB}⟩
A  is called the base of the HNN extension, t  is its stable letter of an HNN Extension and B  and C  are 
the associated subgroups. 
The name stands for Higman-Neumann-Neumann Extension, after Graham Higman, Bernard H. 
Neumann and Hanna Neumann. It also has a topological interpretation – it is the fundamental group 
of a space with a handle added. Such constructions are useful in studying surfaces and three-manifolds. 
Example 18.2 
1.	 Let A = Z , generated by a  and take the subgroups B = ⟨ap⟩ and C = ⟨aq⟩, where p  and 
q  are integers. Let θ : B →C  be the isomorphism specified by θ(ap) = aq. Then 
A∗θ
B,C = ⟨a, t | t−1apt = aq⟩
This is called the Baumslag-Solitar group Bp,q . These provide interesting examples of groups. 
For example, it can be shown that G = B2,3 has a proper quotient which is also isomorphic 
to G. If this property holds, G  is called a non-hopfian group. Examples of non-hopfian finitely 
presented groups are rare. 
2.	 Let A = B = C = 1, the trivial group. Then θ  is also trivial and 
1∗θ
1,1 = ⟨t |⟩∼= Z
Thus, unlike free products with amalgamation, the HNN extension of the trivial group is 
nontrivial.

HNN Extensions
3.	 In general there is more than one extra relation introduced in an HNN extension. For 
example, suppose that A = F2 = ⟨a, b |⟩. Let B  be the subgroup of A  generated by a2 
and b3 and let C  be the subgroup of A  generated by a5 and b7. Both B  and C  are 
isomorphic to A. Let θ  the obvious isomorphism from B  to C  specified by θ(a2) = a5 
and θ(b3 = b7). Then 
A∗θ
B,C = ⟨a, b, t | t−1a2t = a5, t−1b3t = b7⟩
18.2	
Relation to Free Products with Amalgamation
We now interpret HNN extensions as subgroups of free products with amalgamation. 
Lemma 18.3 Let A ,B ,G  and H  be groups. If θ : A →G  and φ : B →H  are homomorphisms 
(isomorphisms) then there exists a unique homomorphism (isomorphism) ψ : A ∗B →G ∗H  such that 
ψ|A = θ  and ψ|B = φ. 
Proof. Let iG  and iH  be the inclusion maps of G  and H  in G ∗H. Define iA  and iB  similarly. Since 
A ∗B  is a free product then there exists, by Proposition 16.6, a unique map ψ  making the following 
diagram commute.

Suppose further that θ  and φ  are isomorphisms. Then there exists a unique homomorphism 
χ : G ∗H →A ∗B  such that χ|G = θ−1 and χ|H = φ−1. Thus (χ o φ)|A = id : A →A  and 
(χ o φ) |B= id : B →B. Thus by uniqueness, 
χ o ψ = id : A ∗B →A ∗B  and, similarly, 
ψ o χ = id : G ∗H →G ∗H. Therefore ψ  is an isomorphism with inverse χ. □ 
Now suppose that A ∼= B  via an isomorphism f , and A  and B  are subgroups of G. Let U  be the 
free product G ∗⟨u⟩ and let V  be the free product G ∗⟨v⟩. Consider the subgroups J = ⟨G, u−1Au⟩ 
of U  and K = ⟨G, v−1Bv⟩ of V . Suppose also that 
g1(u−1a1u)g2(u−1a2u) · · · gn(u−1anu) = 1
Then since g1 ∈G , u−1 ∈⟨u⟩, a1 ∈G , u ∈⟨u⟩ and so on, by uniqueness of the normal form for 
free products, g1 = g2 = · · · = gn = 1 and a1 = a2 = · · · = an = 1. There can therefore be no relators 
involving both elements of G  and elements of u−1Au  in a presentation of J. Thus J ∼= G ∗u−1Au  
and similarly K ∼= G ∗v−1Bv. Let θ : G →G  be the identity map and let φ : u−1Au →v−1Bv  be 
defined by φ(u−1au) = v−1f(a)v. Then both θ  and φ  are isomorphisms and by the lemma above 
there is an isomorphism ψ : J →K. such that ψ|G = id  and ψ|−1
u Au = φ. Let

We now want to show that free products with amalgamation A ∗C B  contain isomorphic copies of A

an isomorphic copy of A. 
Lemma 18.4 Let G  be a group. If A  is a subgroup of G  and N  is a normal subgroup of G . If 
A ∩N = {1G}  then the map p : A →G/N  given by p(a) = aN  is injective. 
Proof. Suppose that for a1 and a2 in A  we have p(a1) = p(a2). Then a1N = a2N  which means that

Again, by uniqueness of the normal form, since the above is in A  we have g(c1)−1 = 1B . . . , g(cn)−1 = 1B  
which gives g(c1) = 1B . . . , g(cn) = 1B  and since g  is injective we have c1 = 1C, . . . cn = 1C , from 
which it follows that f(c1) = 1A, . . . f(cn) = 1A. Thus x =

i αi = 1A∗B. Hence A ∩N = 1A∗B

Then H ∼= F(y, x−1yx, x−2yx2, . . .). 
Proof. Suppose that x−2yx2 ∈⟨y, x−1yx⟩. Then for some n1 . . . nr  and m1 . . . mr  we have 
x−2yx2 = yn1(x−1yx)m1 · · · ynr(x−1yx)mr.
Thus yn1 = 1 and n0 = 0. Then x−2 = x−1 which gives x = 1, a contradiction, unless m1 = 0. 
Similarly we see that all mi  and ni  are 0. But this tells us that x−2yx2 = 1 which is a contradiction. 
Hence 
x−2yx /∈⟨y, x−1yx⟩
It follows in exactly the same manner that for all n,

The Higman-Neumann-Neumann Embedding Theorem
As a highlight we now prove the remarkable Higman-Neumann-Neumann Embedding Theorem, due to 
Higman, B. Neumann and H. Neumann in 1949, which states that every countable group appears as a 
subgroup of a two-generator group. Note that this is in stark contrast to the situation for one-generator 
groups (cyclic groups). Every subgroup of a cyclic group is itself cyclic. The following tells us that there 
is no such restriction on subgroups of two-generator groups.
Theorem 18.7 Every countable group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some two-generator group. 
Proof. Let g0 = 1, g1, g2, . . . be the elements of G. The idea is that we build a group in which these are 
all conjugate. We let H = G ∗F(x, y) and form the subgroups 
A = ⟨y, x−1yx, . . . , x−nyxn, . . .⟩
and 
B = ⟨x, g1y−1xy, . . . , gny−nxyn, . . .⟩
of H. Define the map φ : A →B  given by 
φ(x−nyxn) = gny−nxyn
Then φ  is easily seen to be an isomorphism. Let K = H∗φ
A∼
=B . Then K  contains an isomorphic copy of 
H  as a subgroup, hence an isomorphic copy of G  as a subgroup. For all a ∈A  we have t−1at = φ(t). 
Thus 
t−1x−nyxnt = φ(x−nyxn) = gny−nxyn
which gives 
gn = t−1x−nyxnty−nx−1yn ∈⟨x, y, t⟩
But since x = t−1yt, we have ⟨x, y, t⟩= ⟨y, t⟩ and for all n ⩾0 we have gn ∈⟨y, t⟩. Thus G  is a 
subgroup of a two-generator group. □ 
Note that the previous theorem tells us that, since there are only countably many words on a finite 
alphabet, every finitely generated group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a two-generator group.

19	 Further Reading
Group theory is a vast subject, this is only a tiny book, and there are many further directions you 
could explore. Here are just a few of them. Most of this is reading aimed at final year maths students 
or postgraduates. 
1.	 Solvable and Nilpotent Groups: These have been mentioned in chapter 14. A good concise 
reference is chapter 5 of [3]. For Galois theory I would recommend [11]. 
2.	 Finite Group Theory and Simple Groups: There are many books on finite group theory. The 
classification of the finite simple groups is a very difficult read (I certainly haven’t read it, just 
flicked through books about it) and almost a mathematical subject in its own right. As a field of 
current research there is a strong overlap with computational group theory and algorithms in 
group theory. 
3.	 Topological groups, Lie Groups and Profinite Groups: If you have studied topology at all you 
will know of the concept of a topological space. A topological group is an object which is 
both a group and a topological space, and its multiplication and inverse maps are continous. 
A Lie group is similar, but has added geometric structure and smoothness. Profinite groups 
are a type of topological group but are arrived at by taking limits of finite groups, and have 
been intensely studied in the last 20 −30 years. A good account is given in [6].

4.	 Group Representations: Groups can be studied by how they act on vector spaces. By 
replacing a group with a group of matrices which is a homomorphic image of it, we can use 
all the tools of linear algebra to study groups. The resulting theory, called representation 
theory, is an interesting fusion of groups and matrices and there is a lot of interplay between 
the two. By taking the traces of the matrices obtained we obtain a notion of characters of 
groups, also very important. My favourite book on this topic, without a doubt, is [8]. 
5.	 Bass-Serre Theory: Bass-Serre theory is a central area of group theory. It builds well upon the 
topics in the later parts of this book. It is similar to representation theory in that we study 
groups by what they act upon, but in this case we look at how they act on graphs. In the 
case where the graph is a tree we can decompose the group entirely into free products with 
amalgamation and HNN extensions of smaller groups, given by stabilizers of vertices and 
edges under the action. Applications include Dunwoody’s proof of Stallings’ Ends Theorem. 
Stallings’ Ends Theorem is one of the jewels in the crown of infinite group theory. It 
concerns when a group splits over a finite subgroup as a free product with amalgamation or 
HNN extension, and relates this to topological properties of the group “at infinity”. I would 
recommend Baumslag’s book [1] as a good exposition of Bass-Serre theory, and Dicks and 
Dunwoody’s landmark book [5] for the more ambitious. 
6.	 Combinatorial Group Theory: This is the study of groups given by presentations, i.e. 
generators and relations as in the second half of this book. Often it is easy to write down 
a presentation of a group in mathematics, but not so easy to deduce algebraic facts given a 
presentation, and a whole array of techniques have been developed to do this, both algebraic 
and geometric. There is no single book which covers the whole foundations of this subject 
but probably the most comprehensive is [12]. 
7.	 Geometric Group Theory: Geometric group theory is a way to understand infinite groups 
and provides a certain philosophy on what properties are important: “all finite groups are 
virtually trivial”. Groups are studied up to a relation called quasi-isometry. That is, the 
properties of groups of interest are invariant under quasi-isometry, such as hyperbolicity 
of groups. Bowditch has written a nice introduction for students [4]. Hyperbolic groups 
were introduced by Gromov in the 1980s and form the most fundamental class of groups 
in geometric group theory. The techniques in geometric group theory tend to be large-scale 
geometric, which is actually more like analysis than algebra in flavour. Topology also plays a 
hugely important part, especially asymptotic topology. The subject is still very much under 
active research.
