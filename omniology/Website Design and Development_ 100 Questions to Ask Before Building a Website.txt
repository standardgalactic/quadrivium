Acknowledgments
The entire team  at Wiley has been so supportive of the idea for this 
book. I can never thank them enough. Carol Long got the ball rolling and was 
very patient while it gathered momentum. Ed Connor kept things rolling along 
very smoothly, every once and a while reminding me which direction the ball 
was headed. Ginny Munroe stepped in very capably for Ed when vacation 
time came around. Nancy Sixsmith was there to catch the lack of clarity in 
sentences and to be my “which-that” coach. Warren Wyrostek helped keep the 
technical issues clear and correct and was responsible for there being as many 
illustrations as there are. The staff in the media department made the whole 
process of creating the DVD seem so easy (I just record videos and they show up 
in the book…).
For the content of the book, I need to thank all of my clients over the years 
and the people who have asked me questions in various capacities. You helped 
me better understand how to communicate concepts (often on the second or 
third try). It’s extremely satisfying to see the light go on in another person’s 
mind after you’ve explained something to them—even more satisfying to see 
them make use of it and do well.  
Thanks too, to the Internet. It’s like having that friend who knows every-
thing about a subject, except this friend knows everything about everything. 
There are so many countless articles, blogs, comments, and websites that have 
been useful in the research for this book that I can’t begin to acknowledge all of 
the people behind them. Some are acknowledged in the Resource section of this 
book, and still more with links on the book’s website.
And to all the friends and family who helped look after the kids when work 
or writing called during the summer of 2010, Kim and I are eternally grateful. 
In the future, I’ll try to write during another season.

Introduction
About a year ago,  I was talking to the marketing manager of a large 
organization. He was very excited about a major redesign they had recently 
made to their website, but he had a question about updating some information 
at the bottom of each page on the site. I asked what content manager they were 
using. “Oh we got rid of that,” he said. 
I listened in horror as he described how a web developer advised them to 
take all their content out of a database and create hundreds of individual HTML 
pages. According to the developer, search engines don’t like websites that are 
run by databases. Several thousands of dollars later, here the marketing man-
ager was asking me the best way to change a phone number in all those pages. 
I’ll never forget the look on his face when I explained that the search engine 
advice was nonsense and that changing the phone number with a content man-
ager would have taken about two seconds.
I’ve heard far too many stories like this in my years as a web developer—
time and money wasted on doing things the wrong way or a less efficient way—
when all it would have taken is for someone to ask the right questions at the 
right time.
This book is for that marketing manager and everyone else who could use a 
coach to ask those questions at every stage of building a website.
In the best-case scenario, reading this book will confirm that everything’s 
going well with your site. In the worst-case scenario, it might lead you to start 
again from scratch. Somewhere in between it will help you save time and 
money, and create a better website.
If you already have a website, use this book as a checklist. Again, it would 
be great to come away simply satisfied that the job had been done right the first 
time. But if there’s something that needs fixing, this book will help you identify 
it and provide some guidance on how to correct it.
There’s more and more pressure these days to have a presence on the Web. 
If you’re feeling that pressure but feel equally lost about what it takes to create 
a website, I hope this book will ease the pressure and give you confidence about 
creating the best site possible.

Introduction
The 101st Question
It was once popular to name books 1001 this or 101 that, but I always found that 
a bit gimmicky, so I deliberately stayed away from using 101 in the title. How-
ever, late in the writing process I realized that there was an all-encompassing 
question I hadn’t addressed in the book: Why do you want to build a website?
I’d taken it for granted that this is a book about building websites. But because 
the goal is to raise questions and avoid wasted time, energy, and money, it’s cru-
cial to ask why you’re building a site in the first place. So that’s the 101st ques-
tion of the book: Why?
In this increasingly web-oriented world, it’s easy to shrug off the question by 
saying everyone needs a website and leave it at that. The answers to the ques-
tion are important for you, the website owner, because they’ll help shape the 
nature and growth of the site, as well as provide a way of judging the success of 
the site.
I say answers because you can and probably should have several reasons for 
building a website, and they fall roughly into two camps:
Outcomes you expect from your site
Q
Q
Tasks you expect your site to perform
Q
Q
The Purposes of Your Site
Maybe you expect your site to make you more money, convince people of your 
point of view, get you more fans, provide support for existing customers, unite 
people who share your interests, or accomplish any other number of purposes. 
You might expect your site to achieve several of these goals, but whatever the 
case, it’s crucial that you have these purposes clearly in mind as you plan, exe-
cute, and grow your site.
The best way to have your purposes clearly in mind is to write them down. 
Six months down the road, let alone six hours, you might alter those purposes, 
however slightly, to suit the circumstances of the moment and then convince 
yourself  that these had been the purposes all along. The written word can help 
keep our minds honest.
As you compile a list of purposes, some will be immediately obvious, but 
it’s important not to stop there. Keep thinking and writing. Don’t question or 
second-guess what you come up with; write it down. And get specific. In a sense, 
wanting to get more new customers is the same as wanting to make more money, 

xvi
Introduction
but by being more specific, it’s a goal that’s easier to measure and one that gets 
you closer to deciding what tasks your website must perform. Which brings 
me to the second type of answer to the question: Why do you want to build a 
website?
The Tasks Your Site Must Perform
A website is a communications tool you’re building to help achieve the goals 
you’ve set. But, it’s a communications tool unique in the history of the world 
because it can perform a variety of tasks that no tool before it could have hoped 
to perform on its own. In fact, a website can be virtually every communication 
tool that ever existed, and then some.
A website can be a diary, brochure, book, television, telephone, radio, slide-
show, billboard, business card, and on and on. Not only that, but it can be all of 
them at the same time, or it can be some now and others later. And a year from 
now it could be something no one has thought of yet.
However, all this power and flexibility can be a bit daunting. Even when the 
purposes of your site are clear, you face a myriad of choices for accomplishing 
those goals. Of course, time and money will limit everyone, but that still doesn’t 
resolve the question of exactly which tasks your site should perform; what kind 
of communications tools it should be. You’ll need to look at which tools are best 
for reaching your audience.
Then there’s the problem of peer pressure. Everyone will have their opinion 
of what your website should do—you’ve got to have a blog; video is an absolute 
must; you’re going to have a feed from your TwitLinkedBook account; a live 
chat button is so cool. It’s like having a whole lot of relatives telling you what 
you ought to be when you grow up. When you’re dealing with something new, 
that kind of pressure can be real.
Let me take off some of the pressure. It’s just fine if your website is a static 
one-page “business card” as long as it’s professional-looking, gives a good 
description of your business, has your contact information, and so on. In other 
words, make it a good online business card. Of course you can’t expect such a 
website to do a lot for you, but at least you’ve started a web presence. 
After reading this book, I think you’ll understand why you shouldn’t leave 
your website as a business card for very long. But it’s important that you make 
decisions like that for good reasons rather than because everyone says so.

Introduction
Starting to Plan
Once you’ve got your purposes in mind and the tasks your site will need to per-
form, you can begin the process of planning the site. 
Don’t worry at this stage about organizing anything. Just write down mes-
sages you want to convey on the site: Describe your window cleaning services; 
explain how your sand-blasting process is revolutionary; how you can help 
homeowners to sell their house.
Some messages might be a single page on your site; others might involve sev-
eral pages describing different aspects of the message. Or you might find that the 
message is too general and there are actually several messages behind them. 
The rest of this book will help you develop and refine this plan, but getting 
the basic ideas down on paper as soon as possible is extremely valuable. You’ll 
get more out of this book the more you’ve given some thought already to what 
you want your website to do.
Accompanying Videos on DVD
The Web is dynamic, and printed pages have limited space, so video is a great 
way of showing dynamic content as well as providing additional ideas and com-
ments. Most questions have an accompanying video, for which a brief descrip-
tion is provided in the book as well as on the DVD menu.
Errata
