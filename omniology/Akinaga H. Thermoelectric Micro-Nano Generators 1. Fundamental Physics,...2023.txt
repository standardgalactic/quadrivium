Utilizing the Seebeck effect, thermoelectric materials can convert heat 
into electricity with a solid state device, i.e. a thermoelectric generator. This 
has the potential to contribute largely to society, considering around half of 
all primary energy consumed, i.e. fossil fuels, are lost in the form of waste 
heat, and the viable application of thermoelectric generators can lead to 
substantial energy saving. Furthermore, the trillions of sensors necessary for 
the Internet of Things (IoT) need a dynamic, maintenance-free power source 
of which thermoelectric generators are a promising candidate. The latter 
application is attractive because the motivation is not to supply cheap 
electricity, but high value electricity, which is suited for thermoelectrics, and 
also because thermoelectric conversion is viable with small size devices. 
With this background in mind, this two volume edition of Thermoelectric 
Micro/Nano Generators has been produced to serve as an important, 
comprehensive set of books, encompassing the fundamental principles,  
state-of-the-art advancements and outlooks for this topic.  

x     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
In Volume 1, we mainly deal with fundamental physics, materials and 
measurements. After an introduction on the Strategies for Development of 
High Performance Thermoelectric Materials (Chapter 1) by several of the 
editors, a comprehensive chapter on Computational and Data-Driven 
Development of Thermoelectric Materials (Chapter 2) is given by Prashun 
Gorai and Michael Toriyama. They present in detail the general theory of 
carrier and phonon transport, also including defect formation and doping, 
which are powerful tools for thermoelectric enhancement. Recent powerful 
advancements in the computation field have been made regarding materials 
informatics and machine learning. The authors give detailed advice on how 
to use machine learning to accelerate the search for promising thermoelectric 
materials.  
The next four chapters cover the detailed development and outlook of 
several promising thermoelecric material systems. Notable traditional high 
performance thermoelectric materials systems include Bi2Te3 and PbTe, 
which have unattractive features such as the extreme rareness of Te and high 
toxicity of Pb. Four more sustainable material systems are presented. Holger 
Kleinke covers Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides (Chapter 3). 
Cu2S, Cu2Se and their silver counterparts are abundant materials which have 
been reported to exhibit an extremely high number of merits. This chapter 
covers their basic features and recent advancements, also regarding their 
stability, which has been an issue, together with developments of several 
other selected chalcogenides. Michihiro Ohta, Priyanka Jood and Kazuki 
Imasato have provided a comprehensive chapter on Sulfide Thermoelectrics: 
Materials and Modules (Chapter 4). The versatility and high performance of 
a wide variety of sulfide materials, from layered sulfides like TiS2-based 
compounds and misfit compounds, high temperature rare earth sulfides, 
Chevrel-phase sulfides and mineral-based sulfides, such as tetrahedrite, 
colusite, chalcopyrite, etc., and module fabrication and performance of some 
of the compounds, are covered. Ichiro Terasaki has provided A Concise 
Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides (Chapter 5). Oxides are some of the 
most inexpensive, stable and abundant compounds. Terasaki particularly 
focuses on the physics principles; namely the strong correlation and 
manifestation of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the 
thermoelectric properties, which have resulted in notable high performances. 
He systematically covers several intriguing systems in the 3D 
transition-metal oxides and 4D transition-metal oxides, while giving the 
wide context and meaning in terms of physical principles. Tsuyohiko 
Fujigaya and Yoshiyuki Nonoguchi cover the relatively recent emergence of 
Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators (Chapter 6). They 

Preface     xi 
particularly focus on the fundamentals and development of thermoelectric 
carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The production capability and quality control of 
CNT materials has advanced significantly to make it a candidate for one of 
the potentially most abundant and sustainable material families. The authors 
review in detail the thermoelectric properties of CNTs and control via 
doping, and also comprehensively cover the utilization of CNTs in various 
format thermoelectric generators, including details of processing such as via 
ink, etc. 
The final two chapters deal with the metrology of thermal properties. 
Precise evaluation of the thermoelectric properties is critical for the effective 
development of materials and devices. Yasutaka Amagai covers the Precise 
Measurement of the Absolute Seebeck Coefficient from the Thomson Effect 
(Chapter 7). He includes an instructive and detailed introduction to the 
measurement principles of the Seebeck coefficent, and elucidates new 
methods regarding precision measurement of the absolute Seebeck 
coefficient, which is also known as the absolute scale of thermoelectricity. 
Tetsuya Baba, Takahiro Baba and Takao Mori have provided a chapter on 
Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash 
Method (Chapter 8). The accurate evaluation of thermal diffusivity, and 
thereby thermal conductivity of thin films, is a difficult topic, which is 
important not just for thermoelectrics, but for a variety of fields. The 
principles of the measurement of bulk materials is given, and advances in the 
ultrafast laser flash method utilizing thermoreflectance for thin film 
measurements are given in detail, including equations and derivations for 
accurate data analysis. 
This

comprehensively covers the fundamentals and state-of-the-art advances in 
thermoelectric property enhancement, computational methodolgy, various 
promising material systems, and metrology, which should be useful to a 
wide range of readers, from people who have some curiosity regarding this 
topic and beginners in the field, up to experts desiring guidelines and new 
clues for advanced development.

1.1. Introduction 
Thermoelectric materials and modules/devices represent the solid-state 
conversion of waste heat to electricity (Rowe et al. 1995). Because of  
recent carbon neutral goals and the necessity of realizing the IoT (Internet of 
Things), thermoelectric generators will hopefully contribute to energy saving 
via waste heat power generation (Bell 2008; Hendricks et al. 2022), and also 
as dynamic power sources for innumerable sensors and devices (Mori and 
Priya 2018; Petsagkourakis et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Akinaga 2020). To 
achieve these goals, it is vital to accelerate the development of both materials 
and modules, and applications. In this chapter, regarding the former, the 
materials development, we give an overview on basic strategies for the 
development of high performance thermoelectric materials.

Figure 1.1. Schematic of general trend of carrier concentration dependence of 
Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, power factor (Snyder and Toberer 2008) 
The performance of TE materials is gauged by the so-called figure of 
merit, ZT = α2σT/κ, where α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is electrical 
conductivity, κ is thermal conductivity, and T is temperature. The numerator 
α2σ is called the power factor and is a measure of the maximum output 
power that can be obtained in a fixed applied temperature difference 
condition. The larger ZT is, the closer the maximum conversion efficiency 
ηmax of the thermoelectric material approaches the ideal Carnot efficiency 
ηCarnot = (Th − Tc)/Th, where Th and Tc are the hot side and cold side 
temperatures, respectively, following this dependency on ZT: 
ηmax = ηCarnot[(1 + ZTm)1/2 − 1] / [(1 + ZTm)1/2 + Tc/Th], 
[1.1] 
where Tm is the average temperature. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve as 
high a ZT as possible to obtain high performance thermoelectric 
performance. The difficulty is that the physical properties which compose ZT 
have interrelating tradeoffs. Namely for high ZT, it is ideal to have a large 
Seebeck coefficient α, like an insulator, but also a large σ, like a metal, 
namely with a high electrical conductivity, while simultaneously possessing 
low thermal conductivity κ. In conventional optimization, the carrier 
concentration of a material is tuned by doping. For example, to try to obtain 
an optimum balance between α and σ, as illustrated in Figure 1.1 (Snyder 
and Toberer 2008). This can lead to an increase in the power factor and ZT

in the realms of conventional optimization. In general, it is considered that 
the heavily doped semiconductor regime (e.g. carrier concentration in a wide 
range around 1020 cm-3) is a good target for high performance thermoelectric 
materials. 
However, power generation applications have not been widely realised 
yet, and it is strongly desirable to attain higher ZT and higher conversion 
efficiency. This dictates the need to develop enhancement principles that can 
overcome the tradeoffs, and in this chapter we will briefly review several of 
them. 
1.2. Selectively lowering the thermal conductivity 
1.2.1. Utilizing nanostructuring and defects 
The thermal conductivity is composed of two components; thermal 
conductivity carried by electrical carriers κe and the lattice, i.e. phonons, κl, 
namely κ = κe + κl. From the Wiedemann-Franz relationship, κe is 
proportional to σ which is necessary for a high ZT, and therefore, the vital 
point is to reduce κl in a way that does not kill σ. Liu et al. (2013) 
demonstrated that the lattice thermal conductivity, κl, can be approximated 
from Callaway’s frequency-dependent relaxation time approximation and 
effective medium approximation: 
κl
−1 =κ0
-1 + 2RKd−1, 
[1.2] 
where κ0 represents the bulk thermal conductivity of the material, RK the 
interfacial thermal resistance, i.e. Kapitza resistance, and d the grain 
diameter. 
Therefore, 
the 
grain 
diameter 
can 
be 
reduced 
via 
nanomicrostructuring to obtain a reduced κl. One point to be careful about is 
that the size should preferably be controlled, i.e. made not too small, so that 
electrical carriers are not overly scattered. Namely, utilizing the difference in 
magnitude in the mean-free-paths of electrical carriers and phonons, so that 
the phonons are selectively scattered by the grain boundaries. It should also 
be stressed that the phonon mean-free-path can have a large variation 
depending on the particular material (Liu et al. 2013). 
There are many ways to achieve this nanomicrostructuring, from 
top-down methods such as ball-milling, super-plastic deformation (SPD),  
 
 

6     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
high pressure torsion (HPT), etc., to bottom-up methods such as the wet 
fabrication of nanomicroparticles, creating precipitations, nanopores, etc. in 
the material. Many useful reviews have been written on the details of this 
topic (Sootsman et al. 2009; Mori 2017; Liu et al. 2018; Mao et al. 2018). 
One point which should be stressed is that the understanding of how these 
various defects scatter phonons in different ways has greatly advanced  
(Liu et al. 2018). Namely, the phonon scattering rate τ−1, which is the inverse 
of phonon relaxation time τ, has a different phonon frequency ω depending 
on the different types of defects. For point defects, namely, alloyed/doped 
atoms, vacancies, interstitials: 
τPD
−1 ∝ ω4, 
[1.3] 
which shows that these defects are particular effective to scatter high 
frequency phonons. For line defects, namely, dislocation strain fields and 
dislocation cores: 
τDS
−1 ∝ ω1, τDC
−1 ∝ ω3, 
[1.4] 
respectively, indicating these defects scatter mid-frequency phonons well. 
Two dimensional defects, namely, grain boundaries:  
τGB
−1 ∝ ω0, 
[1.5] 
scatter low frequency phonons. Volume defects, namely, nanopores and 
nanoprecipitates: 
τVD
−1 ∝ ω0 + ω4, 
[1.6] 
scatter phonons over a wide range. Phonon scattering is relatively well 
understood, so the key for enhancement of each material is how to introduce 
appropriate defects/nanostructuring to effectively selectively lower the 
thermal conductivity. 
One recent interesting effect discovered was that a very small amount of 
interstitial doping into Mg3Sb2-type material largely reduced the phonon 
group velocity, leading to radically low thermal conductivity and high ZT for 
this material (Liu et al. 2021a). An initial module demonstrated conversion 
efficiency comparable to the best Bi2Te3-type modules, which have been 

Strategies for Development of High Performance Thermoelectric Materials     7 
champions for over half a century (Liu et al. 2021a, 2022), underlining the 
effectiveness of this type of approach to achieve high performance. 
1.2.2. Utilizing crystal structure and bonding 
As reviewed in the previous section, utilizing nanostructuring and defects 
are effective extrinsic methods to lower the lattice thermal conductivity, κl. 
In regard to intrinsic effects, focusing on particular crystal structures and 
bonding features can provide ways to find inherent low thermal conductivity 
materials. Slack (in Seitz, F. et al. 1979) gave early guidelines, pointing out 
that crystal complexity can lead to low thermal conductivity. Namely 
assuming contribution of only acoustic phonons, κl can be approximated in 
the following formula,  
κl ~ BMδ(θD)3 n−2/3T−1γ−2, 
[1.7] 
where B is a constant, M the mean atomic mass, δ a length parameter 
equalling (volume of the primitive cell)1/3, θD the Debye temperature, n the 
number of atoms in the primitive cell, and γ the Gruneisen constant. 
Therefore, structurally complex materials with a large number of atoms in 
the primitive unit cell exhibit low κl. 
Slack (1995), Nolas et al. (1996), Uher (2021) and others also focused on 
so-called cage compounds, skutterudites and clathrates where loosely bound 
atoms in the structural voids, i.e. guest atoms, were proposed to have 
rattling, namely anharmonic vibrations which effectively scattered acoustic 
phonons and led to low thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the 
electronic bands formed by the framework cage structures provided 
relatively high electrical conductivity, leading to the development of high ZT 
compounds amongst these group of compounds (Rogl et al. 2015; Uher 
2021). In addition to rattling, lone pairs in crystal structures have also been 
demonstrated to lead to low thermal conductivity (Nielsen et al. 2013; Du  
et al. 2016). Boron cluster compounds have also embodied several low 
thermal conductivity mechanisms, such as crystal complexity, as pointed out 
by Slack (Seitz et al. 1979) and Cahill et al. (1989), boron dumbell pairs, and 
partial occupancy (Mori et al. 2007; Mori 2019). Parital occupancy was also 
recently utilized as a descriptor in in a materials genome approach to unearth 
~0.4 W/m/K low thermal conductivity compounds in other systems (Liu  
et al. 2021b). A copper sulfide with ZT~0.7 was developed from these 
discoveries. 

8     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
Recently, bonding effects on phonon scattering have been particularly 
systematically focused on. In addition to particular resonant bonding which 
has been proposed for PbTe (Lee et al. 2014), In2Te5 (Zhang et al. 2020), 
etc., bonding heterogeneity has been widely noted and utilized. Namely, this 
can be considered to be widely related to all mechanisms that have been 
presented, where bonding heterogeneity, namely a mixture in a compound of 
weak and strong bonding, leads to anharmonicity and low κl. The effect of 
bonding heterogeneity has been noted in many systems up until now (Pal et al. 
2018; Dutta et al. 2020). As a recent example, 8 fold difference in lattice 
thermal conductivity has been observed in similar systems with single or 
mixed anion compounds. The local distortion in the crystal structure and 
bonding because of the mixed anions has been found to cause peak splitting 
in the phonon density of states (DOS), which increases the scattering phase 
space, leading to dramatically reduced low κl (Sato et al. 2021).

DOS (Sato et al. 2021). For a color version of this figure,

1.3. Enhancing the Seebeck coefficient/power factor 
From the Mott formula, the Seebeck coefficient α is proportional to the 
energy differential of the energy dependent conductivity σ at the Fermi level 
EF (i.e. chemical potential), as shown in equation [1.8].  
𝛼=

[1.8] 

Strategies for Development of High Performance Thermoelectric Materials     9 
In the single parabolic band approximation (SPB), α can be simply given 
as 
𝛼= 
଼஠మ௞ా
మ
ଷ௘௛మ𝑚∗𝑇 (
஠
ଷ௡)
ଶଷ
ൗ, 
[1.9] 
where m* and n are the effective mass of the charge carrier and the carrier 
concentration, respectively. A heavy effective mass m* leads to a large 
Seebeck coefficient. This means that so-called drag effects, which will be 
descibed next, can enhance α. However, this is tempered by the fact that a 
large m* generally leads to a low carrier mobility, and therefore, it is always 
paramount to keep an eye on maximizing the power factor α2σ. 
There have been several Seebeck coefficient enhancement methods 
proposed which are based on modifying the band structure, i.e. band 
engineering.  
The Seebeck coefficient α is correlated to the energy differential of DOS 
at the Fermi level, and an early proposal was made by Hicks and 
Dresselhaus (1993), in which they focused on the fact that low 
dimensionality can lead to sharp features in DOS, and proposed that the  
so-called confinement effect can enhance α. In another method, Heremans  
et al. (2008) proposed introducing resonance states via doping, thereby 
modify the curvature of DOS near the Fermi level. Wang et al. (2013) 
pointed out that the degeneracy of bands, i.e. band convergence, can also 
lead to enhanced Seebeck coefficients. 
Band engineering from top down is not always easy to achieve. In 
contrast, as a method which is relatively easy to implement, it has been 
proposed to utilize magnetic ion doping, in which if the magnetic ion has 
strong coupling with the electrical carriers, the effective mass can be 
enhanced, and the overall power factor can be improved, as reviewed, for 
example, in (Mori 2017; Hendricks et al. 2022). This has been initially 
demonstrated in non-magnetic systems, such as CuGaTe2 (Ahmed et al. 
2017), Bi2Te3 (Vaney et al. 2019), etc. and called paramagnon drag (Zheng 
et al. 2019). On the overall topic of utilizing magnetism to enhance 
thermoelectrics, there has been a rich field of endeavors. Early, in some 
magnetic elemental materials like iron and nickel at low temperatures, 
enhancements, i.e. peaks, of the Seebeck coefficients were observed, and 
were attributed to magnon drag (Bailyn 1962). Magnon drag has also  
 

10     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
recently been shown to be effective at high temperatures in relatively high 
performance materials (Tsujii and Mori 2013; Ang et al. 2015; Matsuura  
et al. 2022). Terasaki (2013), pointed out that magnetic entropy was the 
source of enhanced performance in the cobaltities, originating from the spin 
high and low states of Co. This phenomenon has also been observed for 
some magnetic sulfides by Hebert et al. (2021). Recently, in weak itinerant 
ferromagnets, enhancement of the Seebeck coefficent at high temperatures 
such as 300 K and above, was indicated to occur from spin fluctuation 
(Tsujii et al. 2019). Namely, it can also intuitively and broadly be considered 
that entropy and spin fluctuation weigh down the carriers.  
Phonon drag, in which strong interaction of the carriers with lattice, i.e. 
electron phonon interaction, was also observed to enhance α at an early time 
(Klemens 1954), more recently, dramatically lead to huge power factors in 
FeSb2 at low temperatures (Bentien et al. 2006; Takahashi et al. 2016).

to enhance the Seebeck coefficient (Pakdel et al. 2018). For a color  
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric1.zip 

Strategies for Development of High Performance Thermoelectric Materials     11 
It should be noted that one advantage in terms of possible application, is 
that for the recently discovered paramagnon drag and spin fluctuation 
enhancements, their effective temperature range can be higher than the 
conventional magnon drag and phonon drag (Hendricks et al. 2022). 
In regard to other power factor enhancement principles, the so-called 
energy filtering phenomena has also been widely claimed. This occurs in 
materials composed of two or more components, where as shown in the 
schematic, the energetic barrier at the interfaces functions as a filter, 
scattering the low energy carriers and allowing the high energy carriers to 
selectively pass, which enhances the Seebeck coefficient (Shakouri et al. 
1998; Heremans et al. 2004). Such enhancement has been claimed for many 
nanocompositing materials, and it is therefore a method that is relatively 
easy to at least attempt to implement.  
For nanocomposites, a niche method showed that by introducing partially 
percolating metallic channels, this could lead to a large improvement of the 
electrical conductivity without killing the Seebeck coefficient in some cases, 
thereby enhancing the power factor (Mori and Hara 2016). This was 
demonstrated for relatively low σ, high α compounds, however, it still 
remains to be demonstrated whether high ZT can be achieved. 
1.4. Outlook for materials development 
As described above, there have been notable advancements in developing 
various strategies to enhance the performance of thermoelectric materials. 
For a long time, the champions in the low temperature region near room 
temperature and mid-high temperature region, have been Bi2Te3-type 
materials and PbTe-type materials. These materials are not optimum in that 
they have extremely tellerium as a main constituent, and for the latter, also 
lead which is a highly toxic element subject to restrictions. However, 
recently, earth abundant materials, such as sulfides, antimonides and 
carbon-based materials have been demonstrated to be able to exhibit high 
performance, expanding the possible target materials. Furthermore, the 
understanding of controlling the electronic and phononic transport and 
electronic structures has also advanced. These developments give hope that 
the materials development can lead to the long awaited wide-spread 
application of thermoelectric power generation.

The development of thermoelectric (TE) materials has witnessed decades
of progress. Experiments, analytical modeling and computations have been
combined with solid-state physics and chemistry to discover, design and
optimize TE materials. In the 21st century, computational and data-driven
approaches have played a pivotal role in the development of new TE materials
and the optimization of existing ones. Additionally, computations have enabled
a deeper fundamental understanding of charge carrier and thermal transport,
which in turn has led to design rules for TE materials.
Edisonian approaches are currently the most common for new TE material
discovery, but are likely to make only a small dent in exploring vast chemical
spaces. Computations have complemented experimental efforts through
modeling of transport properties, for example, with semi-classical Boltzmann

transport theory and high-throughput searches for new TE materials. These
efforts have led to the creation of large, open-access computational databases
of calculated transport and TE properties. In the last decade, computations
have also signiﬁcantly reﬁned our understanding on the role of defects in TE
materials and provided guidance for charge carrier tuning through doping.
With the advent of data-driven approaches, TE material development will
increasingly employ machine learning and material informatics.
In this chapter, we map the historical contributions of computations in
TE material discovery and development, and highlight some recent advances.
First, we discuss the general theory of charge carrier and phonon transport,
and defect formation and doping. In the following section, we review the
application of the theory in computational searches and development of TE
materials. Several examples are brieﬂy discussed in this section. The goal
is to point the reader to relevant studies without delving into the details.
Finally, we highlight several examples of high-throughput searches for new
TE materials that use ﬁrst-principles calculations and/or machine learning
models. This chapter provides a broad overview of the computational and
data-driven development of TE materials, and we hope that the readers will
appreciate and recognize the important role of computations in future TE
material development.
2.1. General theory
We review the general theoretical concepts underpinning the physics of
TE materials. While concepts such as the TE ﬁgure of merit (zT), TE
quality factor (β) and Boltzmann transport theory have been summarized
elsewhere (Askerov 1994; Lundstrom 2002; Goldsmid 2013, 2017; Koumoto
and Mori 2013), we review them here so that this chapter is self-contained. We
begin by reviewing Boltzmann transport theory, which is the most commonly
used framework for modeling and quantifying transport coefﬁcients that are
relevant to TE materials. We discuss the relaxation time approximation and
provide brief derivations of the transport coefﬁcients. Optimization of the TE
performance critically depends on tuning the electronic carrier concentrations,
which is achieved through native or extrinsic doping. In this context, we
discuss the standard dilute defect model for calculating defect formation
thermodynamics. Alloying is widely used by the TE community to enhance
electronic transport, for example, through band convergence, and suppress
phonon transport, for example, by increasing phonon–phonon scattering.

We discuss computational methods to model alloys for predicting formation
thermodynamics and calculating effective band structures.
2.1.1. Boltzmann transport theory
The theory of electronic (and phononic) transport in solids was initially
inspired by the kinetic theory of gases, where electrons are treated as classical
gaseous molecules. Three fundamental assumptions are imposed in these
models: (1) collisions are assumed to instantaneously change the velocity of
a particle, (2) interactions with nearby ions and other electrons are neglected
during scattering events and (3) scattering events occur with a characteristic
probability per unit time, 1/τ, where τ is the average time between collisions.
These assumptions form the basis of the Drude model (Drude 1900; Ashcroft
and Mermin 1976; Kittel and McEuen 1996), in which the electrical current
density is directly proportional to the applied ﬁeld through the electrical
conductivity σ of a material, as given by
σ = ne2τ
m∗
= neμ
[2.1]
where n is the electronic carrier concentration, e is the fundamental elementary
charge, m∗is the effective carrier mass and μ is the carrier mobility.
The model was initially successful in describing electronic transport in
metals and explaining empirical relations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law
for electronic thermal conductivity (Franz and Wiedemann 1853; Ashcroft
and Mermin 1976). Although the “free electron gas” picture was sufﬁcient
to describe electronic transport in certain metals, the Drude model has obvious
limitations. By the early 1920s, it became clear that electrons are non-classical
particles (fermions). Neglecting interactions between electrons (“independent
electron” approximation) and between electrons and the periodic potentials of
ions in a lattice (“free electron” approximation) are some of the critical issues
with the Drude model. To circumvent some of these issues, semi-classical
frameworks were developed, in which interactions with the periodic potential
of ions in a lattice are treated non-classically, while interactions with external
ﬁelds are still considered classically (Ashcroft and Mermin 1976; Lundstrom
2002).

The widely used Boltzmann transport theory is based on a semi-classical
model, which considers the temporal evolution of the distribution of particles
g(r, k, t) in phase space, instead of tracking the motions of individual particles,
for example, charge carriers. Here, g(r, k, t)drdk is the number of particles in
the volumetric element drdk, where r and k are the position and momentum
(wave) vectors, respectively. While g(r, k, t) reduces to the Fermi–Dirac
distribution for electronic charge carriers (Fermions) and the Bose–Einstein
distribution for phonons (Bosons) under equilibrium conditions, the particle
distribution at a point (r, k) in phase space evolves by the diffusion of particles,
driven by external ﬁelds, and through scattering under non-equilibrium
conditions:

It should be noted that equation [2.2] generally accounts for unsteady state
conditions (not to be confused with non-equilibrium conditions), which can
occur in the presence of time-varying ﬁelds, for example. Under steady-state
conditions, ∂g
∂t = 0 and the temporal evolution of g(r, k, t) arises only due to
scattering events into and out of a given state. As a result, the electronic and
phonon scattering mechanisms play a key role in determining the transport
properties and performance of TE materials.
2.1.2. Relaxation time approximation
The distribution evolves as collisions scatter particles into and out of a given
state, which is expressed as

where Wk,k′ is the transition probability from wave vector k to k′, and depends
on the speciﬁc type of scattering event. For example, impurity scattering is
described by an interaction term U(r) in a form similar to Fermi’s golden rule:
Wk,k′ = 2π
ℏniδ(E(k) −E(k′))|⟨k|U|k′⟩|2
[2.4]
The “scattering in” term in equation [2.3] can be understood as a sum
over all particles in occupied states k′, which scatter into the state k,
weighted by the transition probability Wk,k′ and the density of unoccupied
states [1 −g(k)]. The “scattering out” term can be analogously described as
scattering from wave vector k to k′.
In practice, the nonlinear integro-differential Boltzmann equation (equation
[2.2]) is simpliﬁed to a linear partial differential equation through the following
assumptions: (1) g(r, k, t) does not depend on g(r, k, t −dt) after a scattering
event and (2) g(r, k, t) is unaffected by collisions in a region r with local
equilibrium. The two assumptions together form the basis of the relaxation
time approximation (RTA), which effectively assumes that scattering processes
are described by characteristic relaxation times τn(r, k) for band index n. By
assuming that particles encounter scattering events within a time interval dt
with probability dt/τn(k), the scattering term in equation [2.3] becomes,

[2.5]
which simpliﬁes the description of transport considerably, while maintaining
the idea that the temporal change in the electron distribution function is due to
scattering into and out of a given state. We deﬁne g0(k) as the equilibrium
distribution function of particles in phase space. By comparing equations
[2.3] and [2.5], it becomes clear that RTA effectively assumes that scattering
processes are altogether described by a relaxation time τn(k), which itself does
not depend on the speciﬁc shape of g(r, k, t).
2.1.3. Thermoelectric properties
The transport coefﬁcients, namely the electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck
coefﬁcient (α) and electronic thermal conductivity (κe), are understood from

22

the electrical current density and the thermal current density generated by
charge carriers, both of which can be expressed in terms of the particle
distribution function g(r, k, t). The electrical (Je) and thermal (Jt) current

The expressions for these transport coefﬁcients can be simpliﬁed for a
single band (Sofo and Mahan 1994; May and Snyder 2017; Naithani and
Dasgupta 2019; de Boor 2021; Zhu et al. 2021a; Toriyama et al. 2022b) and are
often used to identify the dominant scattering mechanism(s) from experimental
measurements (Kang et al. 2018).
The lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, termed lattice thermal
conductivity (κL), can be derived from the thermal current density and the
phonon distribution function nm(r, q, t), where m is the phonon branch index
and q is the phonon wave vector. Since phonons diffuse and scatter, much
like electronic charge carriers, the equivalent transport equation for phonons,
known as the Peierls–Boltzmann transport equation, in steady state is given by

scattering mechanisms. We solve for the non-equilibrium distribution function
nm(r, q, t) to obtain the phonon lifetimes, which are subsequently used to
calculate κL:

where Cm(ω) is the mode-speciﬁc heat capacity, vm,α(ω) = dω
dq is the phonon
group velocity in the α Cartesian direction, and τm(ω) is the phonon relaxation
time. Equation [2.14] has a form similar to equations [2.10]–[2.12], in which
an integral over phonon modes (vs. electronic states) is performed.
2.1.4. Defect theory
Often, the TE performance of a material needs to be optimized by tuning
the electronic carrier concentration (electrons or holes) through doping. While
the electronic and phonon transport properties shed light on the potential
for TE performance, the actual achievable zT is governed by the ability to
dope a material with the desired electronic carriers (electrons or holes) to
an optimal concentration. The thermodynamics of defect formation, including
native defects and dopants, enable or limit the tuning of the electronic carrier
concentration.
The doping efﬁcacy depends, ﬁrst and foremost, on the nature and
formation energetics of the native defects. In TE materials, it is often the point
defects that dictate the doping properties. Point defects include vacancies,
interstitials,
antisites and even small defect complexes. First-principles
computational modeling of defect formation in materials has signiﬁcantly
reﬁned our understanding on the role of defects in doping. More importantly,
predictive defect modeling has provided guidance for choosing appropriate
dopants. Here, we brieﬂy discuss the theory behind point defect modeling in
semiconductors using the supercell approach (Lany and Zunger 2008).
Within the supercell approach, the defect formation energy ΔED,q (D is
the defect type, q is the charge state) is calculated from the total energies as:
ΔED,q = ED,q −Ehost +

i
+niμi + qEF + Ecorr
[2.15]
where ED,q and Ehost are the total energies of the supercell with and without
the defect, respectively. EF is the Fermi energy, which is typically referenced
to the valence band maximum (VBM), i.e. EF = 0 eV at VBM. The chemical
potential μi of element i is expressed relative to a reference state (μ0
i ) such
that μi = μ0
i + Δμi. A certain number of atoms (ni) of element i are added
(ni < 0) or removed (ni > 0) from the host supercell to form the defect
D. Since ΔED,q is calculated using periodic supercells, the defect formation

energy needs to be “corrected” for the ﬁnite-size effects. These corrections are
denoted by Ecorr. We refer the reader to Lany and Zunger (2008) and Freysoldt
et al. (2014) for a detailed discussion on the ﬁnite-size corrections.

Figure 2.1. Schematic of a defect diagram. Calculated defect formation energies
(ΔED,q) are plotted against the Fermi energy (EF) for various defects and dopants,
which are denoted by straight lines. In semiconductors, EF is typically referenced to
the valence band maximum (VBM) and plotted between the VBM and conduction band
minimum (CBM). The condition of charge neutrality determines the position of the
equilibrium (or pinned) EF, which is a function of temperature. The formation energy of
defects at the EF is relevant
The calculated defect formation energies are graphically presented as a
“defect diagram”, as shown schematically in Figure 2.1, where the defect
formation energy (ΔED,q) is plotted against the Fermi energy (EF). For a
semiconductor with a band gap, EF is typically referenced to the valence band
maximum (VBM), i.e. EF = 0 eV at VBM, and plotted between the VBM and
the conduction band minimum (CBM). Each defect is represented by a set of
straight lines, where the slope of the line is the charge state q of the defect at
a given EF. The linear dependence of ΔED,q on EF is evident from equation
[2.15]. Conventionally, only the lowest-energy (favorable) charge state of a
defect at a speciﬁc EF is drawn because that charge state has the highest
concentration; however, non-zero concentrations of other charge states exist, as
determined by Boltzmann statistics. Neutral defects are denoted by horizontal
lines, while donors (acceptors) are denoted by lines with positive (negative)
slopes.
For a given defect, the EF at which the favorable charge state changes
are the charge transition levels (CTLs), which correspond to quasi-particle

26

defect levels. Donor and acceptor defects are further classiﬁed as shallow
or deep depending on the location of the CTLs. If there are no CTLs inside
the band gap or the CTL lies close to the relevant band edges (donor close
to conduction band, acceptor close to valence band), typically within a few
kBT (kB is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature), the defect is considered
a shallow defect. The charge carrier associated with the shallow defect level
can be easily thermally excited into the bands, thereby creating free charge
carriers. In contrast, deep defects are characterized by defect levels far from
the relevant band edges. The associated charge carriers are bound to such deep
defects and not available as free carriers.
We

satisfying the charge neutrality condition,

[2.16]
where the sum runs over all defects D, and ND is the site concentration where
defect D can be formed. The equilibrium Fermi energy (Eeq
F ) generally lies
around the intersection of the lowest ΔED,q acceptor and donor defects. The
electrical conductivity type (p-type or n-type) is determined by the position
of Eeq
F . The closer Eeq
F is to the corresponding band edge, the higher the
concentration of the charge carriers is. For example, if Eeq
F is close to the
conduction band, electrons are the majority charge carriers. The theoretical
framework described above can be extended to understand extrinsic doping.
2.2. Applications
2.2.1. Transport calculations
2.2.1.1. Charge carrier transport
First-principles modeling and prediction of electronic transport properties
in materials typically involve two steps: (1) calculate the electronic structure
of the material and (2) use Boltzmann transport theory to calculate the
electronic transport coefﬁcients. Several software packages are available to

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
27
solve Boltzmann transport equations, where the electronic structure and carrier
relaxation times (or an approximation) are provided as inputs. These softwares
include BoltzTraP (Madsen and Singh 2006; Madsen et al. 2018), LanTraP
(Wang et al. 2018b), BoltzWann (Pizzi et al. 2014), Perturbo (Zhou et al. 2021),
EPIC STAR (Deng et al. 2020), AMSET (Faghaninia et al. 2015; Ganose
et al. 2021), TransOpt (Li et al. 2021a) and ELECTRA (Li et al. 2021b).
The availability of these software packages and detailed documentations
have enabled calculations of electronic transport coefﬁcients to become
a routine procedure. While the electronic structure is straightforwardly
calculated, the determination of carrier relaxation times from ﬁrst principles
is computationally challenging. Consequently, various approximations are
employed to describe the relaxation time.
The constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) is most commonly
used to calculate the electronic transport coefﬁcients. In CRTA, the relaxation
time τ is assumed to be an energy-independent constant in the entire
Brillouin zone. This approximation was initially justiﬁed on the grounds that
the Seebeck coefﬁcient can be approximately treated as independent of τ
(Schulz et al. 1992; Madsen and Singh 2006). Predictions based on CRTA
are in reasonable agreement with experiments for some materials, including
Bi2Te3 (Scheidemantel et al. 2003), lead chalcogenides (Wang et al. 2007;
Xu et al. 2010, 2011; Singh 2010; Parker et al. 2012; Parker and Singh
2014), half-Heuslers (Yang et al. 2008; Fang et al. 2016), diamond-like
semiconductors (Sevik and Ça˘gın 2009) and zinc antimonides (Bjerg et al.
2011).
Initially,
transport calculations with CRTA provided computational
guidance for optimizing the performance of known TE materials. Notably,
PbSe was predicted to be a good p-type TE material through transport
calculations employing CRTA (Parker and Singh 2010), which was later
conﬁrmed experimentally by heavily doping with Na (Wang et al. 2011)
and alloying with SrSe (Wang et al. 2014). This further inspired transport
calculations for optimizing n-type PbSe (Parker et al. 2012), which was
later demonstrated experimentally through resonant Al doping (Zhang et al.
2012a; Lee et al. 2014b). The TE properties of the ternary antimonide CoSbS
were investigated with CRTA transport calculations, (Parker et al. 2013) and
experimentally realized through Ni doping (Liu et al. 2015; You et al. 2018). A
zT of ∼0.5 at 900 K was achieved in Ni-doped samples, a signiﬁcant increase
from the modest zT of ∼0.2 in undoped CoSbS.

28
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
As CRTA is implemented in several software packages (as noted above)
and is computationally economical, it has been extensively used in several
high-throughput TE material searches and resulted in the creation of large
databases of electronic transport calculations (Ricci et al. 2017; Choudhary
et al. 2020a). Madsen (2006) is credited with some of the earliest attempts
at using computations to guide the search for new TE materials. The study
employed Boltzmann transport theory with CRTA to investigate a large set
of antimonide compounds; LiZnSb was predicted to be a promising n-type
TE material (Madsen 2006). Unfortunately, it was found to be experimentally
challenging to realize n-type LiZnSb (Toberer et al. 2009). We now understand
that LiZnSb is a degenerate p-type semiconductor, and cannot be doped n-type,
at least under equilibrium conditions (Gorai et al. 2019). Since then, similar
high-throughput TE material searches have employed the CRTA (Opahle et al.
2013; Zhu et al. 2015; Miyata et al. 2018). For example, a search among XYZ2
compounds identiﬁed TmAgTe2 as a promising TE material (Zhu et al. 2015)
and later inspired studies of YCuTe2 (Aydemir et al. 2016; Pöhls et al. 2018),
RECuTe2 (RE = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) (Lin et al. 2017) and TmAgxCu1−xTe2 alloys
(Bai et al. 2021). A high-throughput search among 48,000 compounds revealed
that some metal phosphides exhibit good TE performance (Pöhls et al. 2017).
One of these compounds, cubic NiP2, was synthesized and the measured
Seebeck coefﬁcient was found to be in agreement with the predicted values
in a wide temperature range (Pöhls et al. 2017). In another study, thousands
of compounds with high power factors were identiﬁed and documented in the
NIST-JARVIS database (Choudhary et al. 2020a, 2020b).
Charge

calculations
have
also
revealed
composition–structure–property relationships that provide useful guidance in
the discovery and design of new TE materials. For example, a high-throughput
study showed that oxide compounds tend to have a lower power factor
compared to chalcogenide (S, Se, Te) compounds, and therefore, it is more
difﬁcult to ﬁnd high-performing oxide TE materials (Chen et al. 2016). The
electronic ﬁtness function (EFF) has been proposed as a metric to quantify
the suitability of the electronic structure to achieve good TE performance (see
Figure 2.2) (Xing et al. 2017; Feng et al. 2019). The EFF is deﬁned as
EFF = σ
τ

N 2/3
[2.17]
where τ is the scattering time and N is the volumetric density of states.
EFF addresses the competing relationship between the electrical conductivity

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
29
σ and the thermopower S arising from, for example, band convergence and
multiple electronic valleys (Xing et al. 2017; Feng et al. 2019). Therefore, the
EFF ranks materials with high valley degeneracy higher, as multiple carrier
pockets lead to high S while simultaneously maintaining low effective carrier
mass. A high-throughput screening using EFF as a descriptor of the electronic
transport identiﬁed Zintl phases Na2AuBi (p-type) and KSnSb (n-type) as
promising materials with high power factors (Xing et al. 2017), owing to high
band degeneracy (see Figure 2.2). In a similar study using EFF for screening
half-Heuslers, LiBSi was identiﬁed as a promising TE material (Feng et al.
2019).
Recent works that use the CRTA have also elucidated the quantitative
implications of non-parabolic band structures on the electrical transport
properties. The Fermi surfaces of the valence bands in rock-salt lead
chalcogenides exhibit a tubular geometry (Parker et al. 2013; Brod and Snyder
2021), akin to quantum-well structures (Hicks and Dresselhaus 1993) and in
SrTiO3 (Tsuda et al. 2013; Sun and Singh 2016; Dylla et al. 2019). Transport
calculations employing CRTA suggested that the TE performance of n-type
GeTe and SnTe, for which the conduction band structures deviate considerably
from the conventional parabolic shape (Toriyama et al. 2022a), may exceed
those of the lead chalcogenides due to the Fermi surface geometry (Chen
et al. 2013). This later sparked ideas to engineer low-dimensional transport
to improve the TE performance of full-Heusler compounds (Bilc et al. 2015).
Despite
the computational
efﬁciency
of CRTA, there are serious
shortcomings of this approximation. While thermopower is independent of τ
in CRTA, the magnitude of τ still affects the electrical conductivity and the
electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. This effectively restricts the
constant to a mere ﬁtting parameter that must be set on a case-by-case basis
to obtain useful predictions. In fact, Chen et al. (2016) found that invoking
a “universal scattering time” to predict the power factors of a large set of
compounds resulted in poor agreement with experimental results, with a ﬁtting
quality of r2 = 0.33. Katsura et al. (2019) found that τ varies by at least two
orders of magnitude by analyzing hundreds of published data on n-type PbTe.
Ganose et al. (2021) found that better agreement with experimentally measured
carrier mobilities can be achieved by using density functional perturbation
theory (Baroni et al. 2001) with Wannier interpolation (Marzari and Vanderbilt
1997; Souza et al. 2001; Marzari et al. 2012; Verdi and Giustino 2015).
Xu et al. (2020) showed that a variational approach can be used to obtain

better agreement with measured Seebeck coefﬁcients of metals. Graziosi et al.
(2019) demonstrated that considering electron–phonon interactions yields a
different power factor ranking of half-Heusler compounds than with CRTA.
These results suggest that overlooking the details of the scattering physics may
misguide high-throughput searches for TE materials. While the CRTA offers
a computationally efﬁcient method for calculating charge carrier transport
properties, more rigorous approaches which account for various scattering
mechanisms have been introduced since.
The four primary electron–phonon scattering mechanisms are (Yu and
Cardona 2010):
1) acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering, where electrons are
scattered nearly elastically by short-range interactions with long-wavelength
longitudinal acoustic phonons;
2) acoustic phonon piezoelectric scattering, where the electric polarization
induced by mechanical stress in non-centrosymmetric crystals scatters
electrons via long-range Coulombic interactions;
3) non-polar optical phonon scattering, where the electronic structure is
perturbed by bond length ﬂuctuations induced by optical phonons;
4) polar optical phonon scattering (Frölich mechanism),
in which
long-wavelength longitudinal optical phonons induce a macroscopic electric
ﬁeld by uniformly displacing ions of opposite charge.
Mechanisms (1) and (3) are both deformation potential mechanisms, where
changes in either the volume of the unit cell (acoustic phonons) or the
interatomic bond lengths (optical phonons) create deformation potentials that
scatter charge carriers. Mechanisms (2) and (4) both involve an electric
polarization induced by phonons.
Explicit treatment of electron–phonon interactions in materials is now
available in softwares that can directly compute scattering rates from ﬁrst
principles (Bernardi 2016; Giustino 2017). EPW (Giustino et al. 2007;
Noffsinger et al. 2010; Margine and Giustino 2013; Poncé et al. 2016) is often
used in conjunction with the density functional theory (DFT) code Quantum
Espresso (QE) to calculate the electron–phonon coupling matrix and charge
transport properties such as carrier mobility. The calculations involve density
functional perturbation theory (Baroni et al. 2001) and Wannier interpolation
(Marzari and Vanderbilt 1997; Marzari et al. 2012) of the electronic structure.

A number of studies have been dedicated to modeling the electron–phonon
interactions in PbTe. While it is traditionally believed that acoustic phonon
scattering is the dominant charge scattering mechanism in PbTe due to the T r
(r ≤−3/2) temperature dependence of the mobility at carrier concentrations
of ∼
1019 cm−3 (Pei et al. 2012, 2014; Ravich 2013), ﬁrst-principles
calculations suggest that acoustic phonon scattering is dominant only at
high carrier concentrations of ∼1020 cm−3 (Cao et al. 2018). At carrier
concentrations considered in experiments, it is found that scattering by
longitudinal optical phonons is the dominant mechanism for both electrons
(Song et al. 2017; Cao et al. 2018) and holes (D’Souza et al. 2020) (see Figure
2.3). Cao et al. (2018) and Song et al. (2017) independently showed that charge
transport in n-type PbTe is primarily limited by longitudinal optical phonons
unless the carrier concentrations are high enough to sufﬁciently screen the
optical phonons (see Figure 2.3(a) and (b)). D’Souza et al. (2020) found
that although scattering between the L and Σ bands by longitudinal optical
phonons decreases the electrical conductivity in p-type PbTe, the overall TE
performance is enhanced since the scattering increases the thermopower and
decreases the electronic thermal conductivity (see Figure 2.3(c)). Similarly,
Zhou et al. (2018) found that the acoustic phonon deformation potentials of
half-Heusler compounds tend to be lower than optical phonon deformation
potentials, giving rise to their high power factors. The incorrect attribution
to acoustic phonon scattering may partly be due to the similar temperature
dependencies of the carrier mobility to polar optical phonon scattering.
This also indicates that the acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering
mechanism may not be the dominant mechanism for many other polar
materials reported in the literature, including GaAs (Sjakste et al. 2015; Zhou
and Bernardi 2016; Liu et al. 2017), ZnX (X = S, Se) (Ding et al. 2021),
SnSe (Ma et al. 2018), CsPbBr3 (Zhou and Zhang 2020) and full-Heusler
compounds Ba2AuBi, Sr2AuBi and Sr2AuSb (Park et al. 2019, 2020).
Such detailed electron–phonon interaction calculations have been used to
identify potential TE materials. One such example is n-type Ba2AuBi, which is
a full-Heusler compound predicted to reach zT = 5 at 800 K (Park et al. 2019;
Ma et al. 2020). The rather large disparity in the predicted zT for different
carrier types (zTmax ≈5 for n-type, zTmax ≈2 −3 for p-type) has been
suggested to be in part due to differences in the acoustic deformation potential

scattering, in which highly dispersive conduction bands limit the scattering
phase space and weaken the acoustic phonon scattering of electrons, whereas
the relatively ﬂatter valence bands limit the hole lifetimes by increasing the
scattering phase space. It is worth reiterating that charge carrier scattering by
polar optical phonons has been suggested to be the dominant electron–phonon
scattering mechanism in Ba2AuBi, reducing the electron lifetimes by nearly
an order of magnitude at the conduction band edges (Park et al. 2019).

alternative is the constant electron–phonon coupling approximation, where the
scattering time depends on a constant deformation potential as

where Edef is the deformation potential of the band edge (Li et al. 2021a).
This method is implemented in the TransOpt package (Li et al. 2021a). Several
high-throughput screening studies have employed this method, which notably
resulted in the discovery of Cd2Cu3In3Te8 with peak zT > 1 (Xi et al.
2018). In this study, Xi et al. found that vacancy-containing diamond-like
semiconductors with 1-2-4 stoichiometry possess relatively high power factors
(see Figure 2.4(a)), from which the Cu-intercalated Cd2Cu3In3Te8 was
discovered (see Figure 2.4(b)). Studies leveraging cation disorder (Pan et al.
2019) and embedded nanodomains (Pan et al. 2021) have further improved
the TE performance to zT
=
1.2. Other studies have investigated the
TE performance of similar compounds such as Zn2Cu3In3Te8 (Zhang et al.
2021). Using the constant electron–phonon coupling approximation, Li et al.
(2019) predicted 24 diamond-like ABX2 compounds that exhibit promising TE
performance, citing that pnictide-based ABX2 compounds tend to have higher
power factors than chalcogenide-based compounds. The TE performance of
one of the predicted candidates, AgInSe2, was investigated experimentally
(Vasiliev et al. 2021).
Another alternative to explicitly calculating electron–phonon interactions
is the ab initio model for calculating mobility and Seebeck coefﬁcient
using the Boltzmann transport (aMoBT) equation (Faghaninia et al. 2015),
which is implemented in the AMSET software (Ganose et al. 2021). Instead
of assuming a constant relaxation time, the momentum relaxation time
approximation is used to calculate the rates of different charge carrier
scattering mechanisms, resulting in better predictions of mobility and Seebeck
coefﬁcient compared to CRTA (Faghaninia et al. 2015). Pöhls et al. found
that the electrical resistivity of cubic NiP2 calculated by the aMoBT model
better matches the measured resistivity. Using this method, several compounds
in the bournonite structure were suggested as potential candidates for TE
applications (Faghaninia et al. 2017). A high-throughput search using the
implementation in the AMSET package identiﬁed rare-earth phosphides,
RECuZnP2, as promising TE materials (Pöhls et al. 2021). A maximum zT of
0.5 at 800 K was reached in experiments for some of the suggested compounds

(see Figure 2.4(c) and 2.4(d)). Other materials that have been predicted to be
good TE materials include metal halides (Jung et al. 2021), binary Zintl phases
(Kumar and Bera 2021) and mixed-anion compounds (Rahim et al. 2021).

2.2.1.2. Phonon transport
Phonon frequencies and lifetimes in a material are typically calculated
using some set of approximations that balance the computational expense
and accuracy (Xia et al. 2020). These different approximations arise from
the Taylor expansion of the interatomic potential with respect to atomic

36
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
displacements, which are calculated using, for example, density functional
perturbation theory (DFPT) with linear response approaches (Lindsay
et al. 2019). While phonon dispersion is described by harmonic force
constants, the interaction between phonons themselves leads to anharmonicity,
which requires an explicit treatment of three-phonon, and sometimes even
four-phonon, processes to accurately predict the lattice thermal conductivity
(κL) of a material (Lindsay et al. 2019; Xia et al. 2020). However, it is
challenging to calculate higher-order anharmonicity in materials with large
unit cells with DFPT because of the dramatic increase in the computational
expense. To address these issues, the compressive sensing lattice dynamics
(CSLD) approach has been used to calculate only the dominant anharmonic
terms in the Taylor series of the total energy (Zhou et al. 2014, 2019a, 2019b).
A number of user-friendly software packages have implemented methods
for calculating phonon transport properties from ﬁrst-principles calculations.
These software include ShengBTE (Li et al. 2014), almaBTE (Carrete et al.
2017), phono3py (Togo et al. 2015), TDEP (Hellman et al. 2011; Hellman
and Abrikosov 2013; Hellman et al. 2013) a-TDEP (Bottin et al. 2020),
FourPhonon (Han et al. 2022), AICON (Fan and Oganov 2020, 2021), PhonTS
(Chernatynskiy and Phillpot 2015) and ALAMODE (Tadano et al. 2014). The
availability of these software has made direct calculation of phonon transport
properties more accessible, and as a result, there has been a surge in the number
of studies dedicated to investigating thermal transport in TE materials.
Several studies have focused on searching for materials with low κL.
Yang et al. (2018) predicted that cubic Li3Sb has a low κL of 2.2 W/mK at
room temperature from explicit calculations of third-order interatomic force
constants. Yahyaoglu et al. (2021) synthesized cubic Li3Sb and measured
κL ∼2.7 W/mK at 325 K. While a zT of 0.4 was obtained experimentally, a
single parabolic band model showed that the TE performance can be optimized
up to 0.8 (Yahyaoglu et al. 2021), verifying that cubic Li3Sb is a promising TE
material (Yang et al. 2018).
Large anharmonicities often lead to increased phonon–phonon scattering
and low lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline solids. The anharmonicity
strength is quantiﬁed by the Grüneisen parameter γi, which is deﬁned by how

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
37
the phonon mode frequencies (ωi,q) change with the volume of the unit cell
(V ):
γi,q = −∂ln(ωi,q)
∂ln(V )
[2.19]
where i is the mode index and q is the phonon wave vector. Materials with
low κL such as CsAg5Te3 (Lin et al. 2016), half-Heusler CoNbSi (Ye et al.
2021) and AgBi3S5 (Tan et al. 2017) exhibit large anharmonicity as evidenced
by their large Grüneisen parameters. Resonant doping has also been suggested
to increase anharmonicity in materials. In such materials, highly delocalized
electron densities lead to lower transverse optical mode frequencies (Lee et al.
2014a). An accurate treatment of four-phonon processes is sometimes required
to explain the low κL in highly anharmonic materials, as shown for PbTe (Xia
2018) and BAs (Feng et al. 2017). In PbTe, four-phonon scattering processes
are responsible for the signiﬁcant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.
Inclusion of this higher-order phonon interaction is necessary to match the
experimentally measured thermal expansion and thermal conductivity (Xia
2018).
Stereochemically active lone pair electrons have also been found to
contribute to higher anharmonicity by increasing electrostatic repulsion and
bonding asymmetry (Skoug and Morelli 2011; Nielsen et al. 2013; Lai
et al. 2015). For example, He et al. (2017) proposed that Bi2PdO4 is a
promising TE material where the 6s2 Bi lone-pair electrons induce strong bond
anharmonicity (see Figure 2.5(a)). An experimental study later conﬁrmed the
predicted lattice thermal conductivity, although the power factor of undoped
Bi2PdO4 was found to be low, yielding a maximum zT of 4×10−4 at 680
K (Kayser et al. 2020). A combined computational and experimental study
also revealed that the lone-pair electrons of Sb in CuSbS2 play a critical
role in lowering κL, as evidenced by the κL, which is lower than expected
from a simple alloy model of CuSb1−xGaxS2 (Du et al. 2017). The lower
κL of Cu3SbSe3 compared to that of Cu3SbSe4 (Skoug et al. 2010) was
attributed to the lone pair of electrons on Sb that slightly distorts the trigonal
Sb–Se bonding in Cu3SbSe3, as opposed to the tetrahedral Sb–Se bonding in
Cu3SbSe4 (Skoug and Morelli 2011; Zhang et al. 2012b). It was found that the
low κL of Ba6Sn6Se13 is partly due to the lone-pair electrons of Sn2+, which
contribute to the phonon density of states at low frequencies (Gunatilleke et al.
2021). However, it should be noted that lone-pair electrons do not necessarily

38
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
lead to lower κL, but the effect rather depends on the coordination environment
of the atom with the lone pair (Wang et al. 2018a).

Rattling modes can also lead to low lattice thermal conductivity. Rattling
phonon modes are indicated by avoided crossings between the strongly
coupled acoustic and optical branches, resulting in a lower phonon group
velocity and increased scattering (He et al. 2016). Avoided crossings are
understood in terms of the phonon symmetries. Gunatilleke et al. (2021)
showed that, in Ba6Sn6Se13, the chiral and screw symmetries of the crystal
structure prohibit the crossing of phonon bands with the same quasiangular
momentum (see Figure 2.5(b)). In the half-Heusler structure, a weakly

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
39
bounded ﬁller atom has been found to cause an avoided crossing of the
longitudinal acoustic and optical phonon branches (Feng et al. 2020). Due
to avoided crossings observed in phonon dispersion, a “concerted” rattling
mechanism of Ag was proposed as the cause for the low lattice thermal
conductivity of CsAg5Te3 (Lin et al. 2016). In contrast to the vibration of a
sublattice, a different kind of rattling mechanism is proposed to explain the
low thermal conductivity of AgBi3S5, in which only a subset of the Ag and Bi
sublattices vibrate – a mechanism named “double rattling” (see Figure 2.5(c))
(Tan et al. 2017).
To facilitate the fast screening of materials with low (or high) κL, models
based on classical theory have been developed. Yan et al. (2015) developed
a semi-empirical model for κL, where the model inputs are obtained from
inexpensive DFT calculations. Subsequently, Miller et al. (2017b) improved
upon the model to incorporate the effects of anharmonicity through a modeled
Grüneisen parameter that depends only on the average coordination number
of atoms in the structure. These ﬁtted models enable fast and large-scale
computational predictions of κL. A model to predict κL of zinc antimonide
compounds was developed by Bjerg et al. (2014), where the model inputs can
be obtained from the phonon dispersion alone. The low κL of zinc antimonides
was attributed to the Zn and Sb atoms forming low-lying optical modes,
in contrast to the previous understanding that rattling motion of the Sb–Sb
dumbbells contribute to the low-lying optical modes (Schweika et al. 2007).
Moreover, the low κL was attributed to anharmonic motions of Sb atoms
bonded to Zn. It is interesting to note, however, that this model proposed
by Bjerg et al. (2014) overestimates κL in a more diverse set of compounds
(Garrity 2016). Nevertheless, the model was also used to screen for low-κL
materials and found perovskites to exhibit strong anharmonicity and low κL.
Point defect scattering of phonons, which is another mechanism by which
κL is lowered, has been studied with ﬁrst-principles computations. In the
diamond-like semiconductor, AgGaTe2, it was predicted that Ag vacancies
and InGa substitutional defects lower κL considerably due to lattice distortions
induced by the defects and the rattling behavior of Ag vacancies (Zhong
et al. 2021). This reduction was demonstrated experimentally by comparing
Ag0.85Ga0.85In0.15Te2 (κL
=
0.08 W/mK at 850 K) to AgGa0.93Te2
(κL = 0.18 W/mK), leading to an overall improvement in zT from 1.05
to 1.44 at 850 K (Zhong et al. 2021). A similar idea was explored for
half-Heusler compounds, which despite their exceptional electrical transport

40

properties suffer from high κL. Anand et al. (2019) considered combining
the non-valence-balanced TiFeSb (17 electrons) and TiNiSb (19 electrons)
half-Heusler compounds into the valence-balanced Ti2FeNiSb2, which was
predicted to be stable and possess low κL. The compound was experimentally
synthesized and shown to have κL almost three times lower than that of TiCoSb
(Anand et al. 2019) due to Fe/Ni disorder (Liu et al. 2019).
2.2.2. Defect and doping calculations
A thermoelectric material needs to be doped with a speciﬁc carrier
type (electrons or holes) and to a desired carrier concentration to optimize
the zT (Snyder and Toberer 2008). Therefore, it is crucial to understand
and quantitatively model the role of native defects and extrinsic dopants.
The development of the modern theory of defects in semiconductors has
made it possible to predictively model the defect formation thermodynamics
(Anand et al. 2022) using ﬁrst-principles calculations. In recent years, several
software packages for calculation and visualization (see Figure 2.1) have
been developed, including Pylada (Goyal et al. 2017a), PyCDT (Broberg
et al. 2018), PyDEF (Péan et al. 2017; Stoliaroff et al. 2018), MAST
(Mayeshiba et al. 2017), CoFFEE (Naik and Jain 2018), Spinney (Arrigoni
and Madsen 2021) and DASP (Huang et al. 2022). With the availability
of such computational tools and methods, ﬁrst-principles defect modeling
is being increasingly used in the discovery and design of existing and new
thermoelectric materials.
A quantitative assessment of the defect formation thermodynamics (and,
as a result, dopability) of semiconductors is contingent on a variety of
computational uncertainties. Aside from the choice of DFT functional (Peng
et al. 2013), uncertainties can arise from spurious interactions due to periodic
boundary conditions, band ﬁlling effects of shallow defects and alignment
issues of the average electrostatic potential (Burstein 1954; Lany and Zunger
2008). A major obstacle in modeling defect energetics in TE materials
particularly is the prediction of band edge positions relative to vacuum, which
inﬂuence the dopability and intrinsic carrier concentration of a material. West
et al. (2012), for example, showed that spin–orbit coupling inﬂuences the
predicted conductivity type of Bi2Se3 due to a shifting of the absolute band
edge positions. Goyal et al. (2017b), on the other hand, studied the critical
role of the band edge positions in PbTe. Due to the narrow band gap and

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
41
non-negligible spin–orbit coupling effects, the study found that a combination
of the hybrid HSE functional, spin–orbit coupling and GW quasiparticle
calculations are necessary to accurately capture the intrinsic conductivity type
and measured carrier concentration (Goyal et al. 2017b).
In many cases, it is difﬁcult, or even nearly impossible, to dope a
material to its optimal zT, despite predictions of high TE performance from
electrical transport modeling. The dopability of a material can be understood
from native defect energetics, since intrinsic defects that readily form may
compensate for charge carriers generated by dopants. For example, high zT
was initially predicted for n-type LiZnSb, partly due to the high conduction
band degeneracy (Madsen 2006). However, the material was found to be p-type
(Toberer et al. 2009) due to the low formation energy of acceptor-like cation
vacancies (Gorai et al. 2019), prohibiting electrons from being the dominant
charge carrier. Mg3Sb2 is another material where n-type conductivity was
initially difﬁcult to synthesize. Historically, Mg3Sb2 was almost exclusively
synthesized as a p-type material due to the high volatility of Mg and facile
formation of acceptor-like Mg vacancies (see Figure 2.6(a) and (b)). It was
only until recently that, with guidance from defect calculations, n-type
Mg3Sb2 was realized with Te-doping under Mg-rich growth conditions (see
Figure 2.6(c) and (d)) (Ohno et al. 2018). It was also suggested that La-doping
can achieve n-type Mg3Sb2 with an electron concentration of 5 × 1020 cm−3
(Gorai et al. 2018), which was later veriﬁed experimentally in La-doped
Mg3Sb2−xBix (Imasato et al. 2018).
The successful synthesis of n-type Mg3Sb2 contextualizes the importance
of phase stability for tuning defect energetics. Often referred to as “phase
boundary mapping”, the technique charts the possible impurity phases in a
material to gauge the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and, speciﬁcally,
the elemental chemical potentials (Borgsmiller et al. 2022). Since the chemical
potentials (Δμi, which is a part of μi in equation [2.15]) can be determined
from a convex hull analysis, ﬁrst-principles methods can be leveraged to
rationally guide doping procedures of TE materials. For example, the analysis
of native defects in Mg3Sb2 and the convex hull of the Mg–Sb binary system
helped to realize n-type Mg3Sb2 under Mg-rich conditions (see Figure 2.6)
(Ohno et al. 2018). In such thermodynamic conditions, the formation of
acceptor-like Mg vacancies is suppressed, avoiding the possibility of electron
compensation by the native defect. First-principles defect calculations have

42
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
also revealed the high tunability of the carrier concentration (and, as a result,
the electrical transport properties) in Co4Sn6Te6 (Crawford et al. 2018),
Cu2HgGeTe4 (Ortiz et al. 2019), Hg2GeTe4 (Qu et al. 2021), ZnSb (Wood
et al. 2021), BiCuSeO (Toriyama et al. 2021), CuInTe2 (Adamczyk et al. 2020)
and AgBiSe2 (Jang et al. 2022) through phase boundary mapping.

Mg-rich conditions, the achievable EF range with Te doping is near the conduction
band, since the formation of VMg is suppressed. As a result, n-type Mg3Sb2 is achieved
through Te doping under Mg-rich conditions. The predicted electron concentrations are
in agreement with experiments, which are denoted by black markers in (d). Reproduced

Instead of focusing on the defect properties of a single material and
ﬁnding ways to optimize its TE performance directly, recent studies have
begun to explore the prospect of “inverse designing” materials that already
possess the desired doping properties. One route that follows this philosophy
is the chemical replacements in structure prototype (CRISP) method (Gorai
et al. 2020). By generating both known and hypothetical compounds through

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
43
chemical substitutions in a given prototype structure, the CRISP workﬂow
aims to identify stable, high-performing and dopable TE materials within the
generated chemical variants. The methodology was employed to search for
yet-to-be-realized n-type TE materials within ABX Zintl phases, from which
KSnSb was identiﬁed as a promising candidate (Gorai et al. 2020). Notably,
KSnSb was found to be n-type-dopable, fulﬁlling the initial goal of ﬁnding
an n-type Zintl candidate. Furthermore, by exploring the space of ABX4 Zintl
phases, three unreported phases (NaAlSb4, NaGaSb4, CsInSb4) were predicted
as high-performing n-type TE materials that are also n-type dopable (Qu et al.
2020).
In the effort to identify high-performing TE materials with desired doping
properties, some intrinsic material properties have been shown to correlate
well with the dopability of a material. For example, Zintl phases with average
anion oxidation near -1 were found to be likely n-type-dopable due to the
high formation energy of cation vacancies and the resulting absence of electron
compensation (Gorai et al. 2019). Using this chemical guideline, the authors
proposed that ZnAs2, KSb and KBa2As5 are promising n-type TE candidates.
Despite the availability of high-performance computing resources, defect
calculations are still laborious. Besides direct calculations of defect formation
energetics, several alternative routes have been proposed, which can assess
the dopability of materials in an indirect and more high-throughput manner.
One such route is by predicting the absolute band edge positions using
descriptors such as electron afﬁnity and ionization potentials (Zhang et al.
1999; Walukiewicz 2001). Intuitively, n-type doping is challenging when the
absolute energy of the conduction band minimum is high, and p-type doping
is difﬁcult when the absolute valence band maximum position is low. This
guiding principle works well for many semiconductors, such as explaining the
n-type dopability of the wide-gap ZnO and bipolar dopability of narrow-gap
PbTe. In fact, the absolute band edge positions correlate with the dopabilities
of rock-salt IV–VI compounds; while it is difﬁcult to dope SnTe and GeTe
n-types due to the high conduction band minimum energy, n-type PbTe
is commonly achieved due to the lower conduction band minimum (Huo
et al. 2021). Alternatively, the branch point energy was used to assess the
dopabilities of ABXO (A,B = metals; X = S, Se, Te) phases (He et al. 2020).
Since the branch point energy was found to be close to the middle of the band
gap in BiAgXO compounds, He et al. (2020) concluded that the compounds

44
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
are p-type-dopable, similar to the well-known p-type TE materials BiCuSeO
(Zhao et al. 2014; Toriyama et al. 2021).

et al. (2020) with permission from Springer and the American Chemical Society
A potential alternative approach to predicting the native defect energetics
and dopability of a material is to leverage machine learning techniques. Miller
et al. (2018) suggested an empirical model for dopability in diamond-like
semiconductors (DLS), using a linear regression model developed from
experimental carrier concentration data on 127 DLS compounds (see Figure
2.7(a)). Although accurate predictions of carrier concentrations in DLS are
achieved within approximately one order of magnitude, the interpretation for
the underlying physics behind the model is still unclear. Furthermore, the
transferability of the model to other types of materials is uncertain. Goyal
et al. (2020) developed a dopability model for ionic binary semiconductors
based on intrinsic material descriptors. The model is validated against
the pinning energies from ﬁrst-principles calculations. As shown in Figure
2.7(b), both p-type and n-type dopabilities ﬁt well for 16 classic binary
semiconductors including III–Vs, II–VIs, group-III oxides, and lead and
bismuth chalcogenides. It is argued that the dopability for semiconductors
is a result of complex trade-offs between various intrinsic properties
including electronic properties, nuclear repulsion and chemical potentials
for constituent elements. This work points out that absolute band edge
positions alone cannot be used to accurately describe the dopability of
semiconductors. With the advent of diverse machine learning techniques,

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials

which will be described in the following section, there are many opportunities
to employ such techniques towards understanding the thermodynamic and
electronic properties of defects in semiconductors (Mannodi-Kanakkithodi
et al. 2020, 2022; Mannodi-Kanakkithodi and Chan 2022; Polak et al. 2022).
2.2.3. Thermoelectric
material
search
with
high-throughput
computations and machine learning
With the advances in computing power and methodologies, computational
chemistry has made great strides in accelerating the discovery of functional
materials with tailored properties. The ability to perform high-throughput
(HT) ab initio calculations, in particular those based on density functional
theory (DFT), has been instrumental in inorganic functional material
discovery, including materials for TE applications. Such HT searches employ
computationally tractable descriptors to assess the TE performance of large
chemical spaces.
More recently, machine learning (ML) and material informatics approaches
have been employed to further accelerate the search of TE materials. The rapid
prediction of transport properties and TE performance with ML models has
allowed the search to be expanded into even larger chemical spaces, including
hypothetical compounds. Applications of material informations in TEs have
made great strides in predicting relevant material properties such as lattice
thermal conductivity and power factor, resulting in the prediction of many
promising TE candidates, some of which have been synthesized and measured
experimentally. There are a variety of ML techniques that have been used to
predict TE properties, including decision trees and random forest regression,
the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator method (Ouyang
et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2020), gene expression programming (Abdellahi et al.
2015), neural networks (Laugier et al. 2018; Na et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2021b),
symbolic regression (Loftis et al. 2021), Bayesian optimization (Seko et al.
2015; Bassman et al. 2018) and active learning (Bassman et al. 2018; Hou
et al. 2019; Sheng et al. 2020; Takagiwa et al. 2021; Tranås et al. 2022). These
ML techniques are often trained on large databases of experimental and/or
computational DFT data (Curtarolo et al. 2012; Gaultois et al. 2013; Jain et al.
2013; Gorai et al. 2016; Ricci et al. 2017; Choudhary et al. 2020a).

High-throughput computational searches employ descriptors that are
identiﬁed a priori. For a detailed account of the descriptors and various HT
searches for TE materials, we refer the reader to Gorai et al. (2017). Here,
we discuss a few examples. Barreteau et al. (2019) searched for potential TE
materials in the chemical space of TMX intermetallics, using thermodynamic
stability and electronic structure features as screening criteria. One of the
compounds identiﬁed in this study, half-Heusler TaFeSb, was later found to
exhibit high TE performance experimentally, reaching a peak zT of 1.52 at
973 K when the Ta site is co-doped with V and Ti (Grytsiv et al. 2019;
Zhu et al. 2019). Wang et al. (2020a) used band gap and average atomic
mass to screen 27,782 ternary copper-based pnictides and chalcogenides (see
Figure 2.8(a)), from which they identiﬁed Cu3ErTe3 as a promising TE
candidate (see Figure 2.8(b)). The compound was subsequently synthesized
experimentally, exhibiting a peak zT upwards of 1.0 when doped with Ag
(see Figure 2.8(c)) (Wang et al. 2020a). Zhang et al. (2017) used various
features of the crystal structure to screen Cu- and S-containing compounds
for potential TE candidates. For example, one of the screening criteria was
that Cu–S polyhedra in the structure must form a three-dimensional network,

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
47
so that the carrier mobility is likely high. Using this and other screening
criteria, the study identiﬁed and experimentally measured Cu6Fe2S8Sn and
Cu16Fe4.3S24Sn4Zn1.7 as high-performing TE materials (Zhang et al. 2017).
Miller et al. (2017a) used a semi-empirical formulation of the TE quality factor
to screen 735 oxide materials, from which they predicted SnO as a promising
n-type candidate. However, the stability of SnO was found to be limited along
the Sn–O binary phase space, leading to signiﬁcant concentrations of SnO2
during processing and low zT as a result (Miller et al. 2017a).
Often, regression techniques are used to identify relevant descriptors for
properties of interest. While a slough of ML techniques have been applied to
derive descriptors of transport properties, the models tend to recover similar
physical descriptors for the property of interest. For example, ML models for
predicting lattice thermal conductivity (κL) often identify the same material
descriptors that appear in the analytical models of κL, such as the Slack and
Debye–Callaway models. Random forest regression was used to identify heat
capacity and phononic phase space volume as two prominent descriptors of
κL (Carrete et al. 2014), which directly appear in the analytical κL models. A
study of 120 binary, ternary and quaternary compounds found that κL depends
strongly on physical quantities such as the maximum phonon frequency,
integrated Grüneisen parameter, average atomic mass and the unit cell volume
(Juneja et al. 2019). Bonding characteristics and electrical transport properties,
such as the Seebeck coefﬁcient and electrical conductivity, have also been
used as descriptors to improve an ML model for κL (Juneja and Singh 2020).
Correlations with the atomic masses of the constituent elements (Miyazaki
et al. 2021), as well as the atomization enthalpy and unit cell volume (Wang
et al. 2020b), have also been found using decision tree regression and extreme
gradient boosting. For half-Heusler compounds, descriptors such as the lattice
parameter, the atomic radii and atomic masses of the constituent elements are
needed to predict κL (Miyazaki et al. 2021). For oxide TE materials, the ratio
of oxygen to transition metal atoms was found to be a good descriptor of κL
using a gradient-boosted tree model (Tewari et al. 2020).
Given
that
these
techniques
typically
recover
physically
relevant
descriptors that appear in analytical models of κL, it is interesting to compare
the accuracies of the ML models to those of the analytical models. Chen et al.
(2019) found that their ML model has accuracy comparable to the Slack and
Debye–Callaway models. Juneja et al. (2019) found that predictions made by
an ML model developed using Gaussian process regression (GPR) predicts κL

48
Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1
more accurately than the Slack model by an order of magnitude. Symbolic
regression has also been used to develop models of κL, which outperform the
Slack model (Loftis et al. 2021).
Material descriptors that are relevant for electrical transport properties have
also been elucidated by regression techniques. Gradient-boosted decision trees
identiﬁed that polarizability, atomic masses and radii, and refractive index
are necessary features to quantitatively predict the Seebeck coefﬁcient and
power factor of materials (Choudhary et al. 2020b). In addition to elemental
descriptors, predictions of the Seebeck coefﬁcient and electrical conductivity
have been found to improve with chemical bonding-based descriptors (Juneja
and Singh 2020).
ML models are now routinely employed to rapidly identify promising TE
material candidates from large chemical spaces. Many studies have trained ML
models to predict low-κL materials for potential TE applications. Carrete et al.
(2014) trained an ML model on a large dataset of half-Heusler compounds,
predicting that PtLaSb, RhLaTe and SbNaSr should exhibit low κL. The
low κL of PtLaSb was later conﬁrmed by solving the Peierls–Boltzmann
transport equation and through ab initio molecular dynamics (Feng et al.
2020), inspiring further investigations on its TE properties (Xue et al.
2016). It is interesting to note, however, that SbNaSr, another half-Heusler
compound that was predicted to have a low κL (Carrete et al. 2014),
was later found to be dynamically unstable by ﬁrst-principles calculations
(Feng et al. 2020), suggesting that ML-based predictions of κL should be
supported by more in-depth ﬁrst-principles calculations. Seko et al. (2015)
used Bayesian optimization techniques to screen 221 low-κL compounds out
of a dataset of 54,779 compounds considered, using only the volume, density
and elemental properties as descriptors. One of the compounds predicted
to have low κL, Cs2PdCl4I2, was investigated further using ﬁrst-principles
calculations (Guo 2016; Li and Yang 2016), predicting a thermal conductivity
of 0.31 W/mK with maximum zT of 0.7 (Guo 2016). Wang et al. (2020b)
used extreme gradient boosting to predict low-κL compounds, which resulted
in the prediction of BiTe2Tl, Br2Cs2F2, Au3CsSe2 and Cl2CsI as low-κL
compounds. Zhang et al. used a web-based recommendation engine (Gaultois
et al. 2016) to predict low-κL compounds in the RE4M2XGe4 chemical
space. Although intermetallic compounds typically display high κL on
the order of 101 −102 W/mK (Terada et al. 2002), Nd4Mn2InGe4 and
Nd4Mn2AgGe4 were predicted, and subsequently shown experimentally, to

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials

possess κL < 10 W/mK. Zhu et al. (2021b) revealed using random forest
regression and crystal graph convolutional neural networks that rare-earth
chalcogenides rank in the lowest 5% of the predicted κL, which was
experimentally veriﬁed for several compounds in this family (see Figure 2.9).
Interestingly, the study found by performing additional electrical transport
measurements on Bi-doped Er2Te3 and Y2Te3 that the zT reaches upwards of
1, suggesting that rare-earth chalcogenides are promising TE candidates (Zhu
et al. 2021b; Toriyama et al. 2022c).

ML models have also been used to improve electrical transport properties
of TE materials. For example, the power factor of n-type Al2Fe3Si3 was
enhanced by ∼40% by continuously feeding experimentally measured data
to a developing ML model (see Figure 2.10(a)) (Hou et al. 2019). In this
study, Hou et al. began with an initial ML model that was constructed from
measured TE property data of Al23.5+xFe36.5Si40−x at several compositions,
which was used to predict new compositions with enhanced power factors.
The predictions were experimentally synthesized, and the measured data
on the new batch of samples was fed into the ML model to make new
predictions. An overall improvement in the maximum power factor from
525 μW/mK2 at x = 0 to 670 μW/mK2 at x = 0.9 was achieved through this
method (see Figure 2.10(b)) (Hou et al. 2019). A similar iterative approach
was used to improve the power factor of Co-doped Al–Fe–Si-based TE
materials (Takagiwa et al. 2021). Iwasaki et al. (2019a, 2019b) used ML
models to study the anomalous Nernst effect in spin-driven TE systems. They
found a positive correlation between the orbital angular momentum and the
spin-driven thermopower when studying a rare-earth-substituted yttrium iron
garnet system, from which they predicted and veriﬁed experimentally that
Fe0.7Pt0.3Sm0.05 has a higher thermopower than FePt alloys (Iwasaki et al.
2019b). Afterwards, Iwasaki et al. (2019a) studied the M100−xPtx (M = Fe,
Co and Ni) system using similar ML approaches. In addition to recovering the
known physics of spin-driven TE materials (e.g. that the anomalous Nernst
effect arises only in magnetic materials), they found that the effect can be
enhanced by the local spin polarization and orbital moment of Pt. Using
this knowledge, Iwasaki et al. (2019a) predicted that Co50Pt50Nx will exhibit
enhanced spin-driven thermopower compared to the parent CoPt alloy, which
was conﬁrmed experimentally.
ML models that simultaneously predict the electrical and thermal
transport properties (and, as a result, zT) have also been developed.
Gaultois et al. (2016) built a web-based recommendation engine that
simultaneously optimizes the Seebeck coefﬁcient, electrical conductivity and
thermal conductivity for a given chemical composition. The engine predicted
that RE12Co5Bi (RE = Gd, Er) displays properties that are optimal for
thermoelectricity, as veriﬁed in the same study experimentally (Gaultois
et al. 2016). While the recommendation engine correctly predicted the
thermal conductivity at room temperature, experimental validation revealed
that the thermal diffusivity of RE12Co5Bi increases with temperature up
to 800 K, demonstrating that the experimental veriﬁcation of ML-predicted

Computational and Data-Driven Development of Thermoelectric Materials
51
compounds may lead to simultaneously revealing anomalous behaviors in
materials. Moreover, attempts to synthesize Gd12Co5Bi led to the discovery of
cubic Gd12Co5.3Bi with lower electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity
(Oliynyk et al. 2016), demonstrating that ML-based predictions of TE
candidates may lead to experimental realizations of similar compounds with
comparable, or even better, performance. Bassman et al. (2018) used an
active learning method and a Gaussian process regression model to develop
stacked heterostructures for TE applications. By developing a model to predict
the electronic ﬁtness function (Xing et al. 2017) for doped heterostructures,
they predicted that the three-layer MoSe2–WS2–WS2 and WSe2–WTe2–WSe2
system
is
the
best
n-type
candidate,
and
WTe2–MoTe2–WTe2
and
MoSe2–WSe2–WSe2 are the best p-type candidates.

2.3. Outlook
The discovery and design of thermoelectric materials have greatly beneﬁted
from the advances in computational methods and development of software
packages. In this chapter, we have mapped the historical contributions of
computations and data-driven approaches in thermoelectric material research
and highlighted some recent advances. While this book chapter solely
focuses on ﬁrst-principles computations and machine learning in TE material
development, we must also acknowledge the important role of micro-scale
continuum modeling and speciﬁcally device modeling.

There are outstanding challenges in the computational modeling of
thermoelectric materials that need to be addressed. There is a need to
develop computationally efﬁcient and more accurate methods for calculating
scattering rates, and incorporating temperature-dependent effects and disorder
in the calculation of transport and thermoelectric properties. Computational
TE material discovery, by and large, has focused on stoichiometric and
ordered structures that are documented in crystallographic databases, but
a massively larger search space of hypothetical compounds, including
disordered phases and alloys,
remains to be explored. Computational
methods need to be developed to assess large chemical spaces that contain
one to two orders of magnitude more structures compared to traditional
high-throughput DFT searches. Data-driven methods will likely play a key
role in this development. Finally, it is imperative that computational ﬁndings
are experimentally veriﬁed to avoid overwhelming the thermoelectric literature
with unreasonable predictions. Currently, the rate of computational predictions
outpaces experimental veriﬁcation. The development of high-throughput
solid-state synthesis and characterization will allow experimental veriﬁcation
to keep pace with computational predictions.

3.1. Introduction 
The importance of thermoelectric (TE) energy generation as a sustainable 
energy conversion method continues to increase (He and Tritt 2017; Shi et 
al. 2020). Historically, TE generators have been used in a number of 
spacecraft for several decades (Furlong and Wahlquist 1999; Yang and 
Caillat 2006). Since the 1990s, TEs have been studied for use in automobiles 
and some stationary applications to convert their waste heat into useful 
energy (Yang and Caillat 2006; Yang and Stabler 2009; Matsumoto et al. 
2015; Orr et al. 2016). More recently, applications of interest began to 
include TE generators powered by body heat (Yang et al. 2007; Leonov and 
Vullers 2009; Francioso et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2019), as well as powering 
the billions of sensors in the Internet of Things of Society 5.0 (Park et al. 
2019; Zaia et al. 2019; Freer and Powell 2020).  
The efficiency of the TE energy conversion increases with an increasing 
figure of merit zT = Tα2σ κ–1. Here, T denotes the average temperature, α

denotes the Seebeck coefficient, σ denotes the electrical conductivity and κ 
denotes the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity consists of two 
parts, the lattice (κL) and the electronic thermal conductivity (κe): κ = κL + κe. 
κe is proportional to σ and T, as expressed in the Wiedemann–Franz law:  
κe = L0σ T, where L0 is the Lorenz number. With the exception of κL, all of 
these physical properties depend on the charge carrier concentration n. As n 
increases, the Seebeck coefficient decreases, and σ and κe increase. 
Therefore, κL is the only property that can be optimized (decreased) 
independently, mainly by incorporating heavy elements into TEs (Snyder 
and Toberer 2008; Kleinke 2010; Shi et al. 2019). This readily explains the 
history of focusing on variants of Bi2Te3 and PbTe (Pei et al. 2011), with 
their average molar masses of 160.2 g mol–1 and 167.4 g mol–1 and κL values 
of 1.5 W m–1K–1 and 2.2 W m–1K–1, respectively, and later on more complex 
antimonides and tellurides. Examples for the latter are, in no particular  
order, the antimonides Ba0.08La0.05Yb0.04Co4Sb12 (Shi et al. 2011), 
Yb14Mn0.4Al0.6Sb11 (Toberer et al. 2008) and β-Zn4Sb3 (Caillat et al. 1997), 
and the tellurides Tl9Bi0.98Te6 (Guo et al. 2013), Tl8.05Sn1.95Te6 and 
Tl8.10Pb1.90Te6 (Guo et al. 2014) and Tl2Ag12Te7.4 (Shi et al. 2018), all of 
which exhibit peak zT values above unity and, in part, κL values below  
1 W m–1K–1.  
Further improvements can be achieved by different nanostructuring 
methods, which in part resulted in peak zT values above 2. Prominent 
examples are superlattices of Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 (Venkatasubramanian et al. 
2001) and PbSe0.98Te0.02/PbTe (Harman et al. 2005), Bi2Te3 nanowires (Lv  
et al. 2013), Na-doped PbTe/SrTe (Biswas et al. 2012) and Cu2Se/CuInSe2 
nanocomposites (Olvera et al. 2017), and nanostructured Cu2Se (Gahtori  
et al. 2015).  
Recently, the focus has begun to shift from tellurides to more abundant 
and environmentally benign sulfides and selenides. For these materials, other 
methods of achieving low thermal conductivity must be used because they 
are composed of lighter elements. An advantageous property in this regard is 
anharmonicity, as demonstrated for SnSe (Lee et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021) 
and the tetrahedrites Cu12-xMxSb4S13, with M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn and Hg. A 
second is extreme disorder, all the way up to a “liquid-like” sublattice as 
realized in various copper chalcogenides, the focus of this chapter, including 
β-Cu2Se (Liu et al. 2012).  

Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides     75 
3.2. Binary copper and silver chalcogenides 
The TE properties of the sulfide Cu2S were investigated as early as the 
19th century (Dennler et al. 2014). The p-type selenide Cu2Se was used in a 
device in the 1980s, which unfortunately failed rapidly as Cu ions diffused 
out of the TE leg (Brown et al. 2013). This spectacular failure has hindered 
the study of these and related copper chalcogenides for decades. But in the 
last 10 years, more and more research groups have sought to identify 
methods of inhibiting Cu ion migration to minimize decay (Mayasree et al. 
2012; Qiu et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2019), leading to a renewed interest in these 
materials.  
The six Cu and Ag chalcogenides Cu2Q and Ag2Q, with Q = S, Se and 
Te, all adopt structures with fixed positions of the Q2– anions, and Cu+ and 
Ag+ ions in different holes. These binaries undergo various phase transitions, 
which in part result in superionic conductivity. The chalcocite Cu2S adopts 
three different structures at different temperatures. Below 370 K, the 
monoclinic γ-phase is thermodynamically preferred. At approximately 370 K, 
a phase transformation occurs in the hexagonal β-phase. At approximately 
700 K, the β-phase transforms into the superionic cubic α-phase  
(Balapanov et al. 2004). Despite its relatively low average molar mass of 
53.1 g mol–1, its lattice thermal conductivity κL is below 0.8 W m–1K–1, 
which is a consequence of its liquid-like Cu atom sublattice. The slightly  
Cu-deficient Cu1.97S shows an exceptionally high peak figure of merit with 
its zTmax = 1.7 at 1,000 K (He et al. 2014), and Cu1.97S produced via a  
melt-solidification technique has an even higher zTmax of 1.9 at 973 K (Zhao 
et al. 2015a). However, its superionic property leads to a low stability of this 
material. The addition of excessive amounts of iodine resulted in superionic 
Cu2S exhibiting zTmax = 1.8 also at 973 K, with the benefit of increased 
stability (Zhao et al. 2020).  
The Cu ion conductor β-Cu2Se is the thermodynamically preferred 
modification above 410 K. Its structure is based on fluorite, where the Se 
atoms form a cubic closed-packed arrangement with Cu atoms in all 
tetrahedral holes and are kinetically disordered over various interstitial sites 
(see Figure 3.1).

of β-Cu2Se 
The total thermal conductivity values, including the electronic 
contribution, are mostly below 1 W m–1K–1 for Cu2Se-based materials. 
Several research groups have reported excellent zTmax values above 950 K, 
such as 1.8 after self-propagating synthesis (Su et al. 2014), 1.8 after melt 
quenching (Zhao et al. 2015b) and finally zTmax values between 2 and 2.1 by 
including defects on the nanoscale (Gahtori et al. 2015), spark plasma 
sintering of nanopowders (Tafti et al. 2016) and doping Cu2Se with lithium 
(Cu1.97Li0.03Se) (Hu et al. 2018) and sodium (Cu1.96Na0.04Se) (Zhu et al. 2019) 
with nano- and micropores, respectively. Figure 3.2 shows the figure of 
merit data of the last three examples along with the respective low thermal 
conductivity data, including when alloyed with S (Cu1.96S0.2Se0.8) (Mao et al. 
2020). The peaks around 400 K are caused by phase transitions.

of merit (right) of leading Cu2Se materials 

Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides     77 
Further achievements were made via the nanocomposite approach, which 
generally resulted in lower thermal conductivity and higher zT values. The 
addition of various carbon nanostructures was particularly advantageous. For 
example, the use of carbon nanodots (CD) (Hu et al. 2020), graphene (Li  
et al. 2018) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) (Nunna et al. 2017) led to peak zT 
values between 2.2 and 2.4, all with total thermal conductivity values below 
0.6 W m–1K–1 (see Figure 3.3).  
           
 
Figure 3.3. Thermal conductivity (left) and figure  
of merit (right) of leading Cu2Se nanocomposites 
Contrary to the usual trends, Cu2Te shows less impressive TE properties 
than its lighter homologues. Of its five modifications, the cubic ε-phase, 
stable above 850 K, has the largest zTmax values, including 1.0 at 900 K when 
doped with Ag (Ballikaya et al. 2013) and 1.1 at 1,000 K after minimizing 
the carrier concentration (He et al. 2015).  
α-Ag2S transforms into the cubic β-phase at approximately 450 K, which 
in turn changes into the γ-modification at approximately 860 K (Sharma  
and Chang 1986). Ag2S falls behind the binary copper sulfides in TE 
performance, reaching a more modest peak zT value of 0.55 at 580 K (Wang 
et al. 2019).  
On the contrary, the heavier binary silver chalcogenides, Ag2Se and 
Ag2Te, reach their peak zT values at significantly lower temperatures, in line 
with their narrower band gaps of, for example, Eg < 0.2 eV for Ag2Se (Ferhat 
and Nagao 2000), compared to Ag2S and the copper analogs with gaps  
 
 
 

78     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
of 1.0–1.2 eV. Ag2Se shows a phase transition around 410 K from an 
orthorhombic modification to a cubic ion conductor (Billetter and 
Ruschewitz 2008), and reaches zT values above 1 at relatively low 
temperatures, for example 1.2 at 390 K with a low carrier concentration of  
n = 1018 cm–3 (Yang et al. 2017). At approximately room temperature, Ag2Se 
showed zT values above 0.8, making it an attractive alternative to Bi2Te3 
(Huang et al. 2021).  
Ag2Te is – thus far – the best performing binary silver chalcogenide.  
Its monoclinic α-phase is preferred below 418 K, the cubic β-phase above 
418 K and the γ-phase above 1,075 K (Fujikane et al. 2005). Its Sb-doped 
variant was reported to achieve zTmax = 1.4 at 410 K (Zhu et al. 2020).  
3.3. Ternary and higher copper and silver chalcogenides 
3.3.1. Minerals based on copper and silver chalcogenides 
Several minerals in this class, mostly based on copper sulfides, are under 
investigation for their outstanding TE properties. The high-temperature 
phase of the bornite Cu5FeS4 can be viewed as four units of Cu2S  
(i.e. Cu8S4), where one Cu is replaced by Fe and two Cu atoms by  
vacancies , resulting in Cu5Fe2S4. Its low lattice thermal conductivity of  
κL = 0.5 W m–1K–1 is a consequence of the deficiencies and Cu ion disorder 
(Qiu et al. 2014). The Fe atoms reduce the migration of Cu ions and increase 
the stability of bornite. The variant Cu4.972Fe0.968S4 has been reported to reach 
zTmax = 0.79 at 550 K (Long et al. 2018).  
The colusites Cu26M2E6S32 (with M = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W and E =  
Ge, Sn, As, Sb) also have low thermal conductivity, which is a consequence 
of their large complex unit cells. Impressive zTmax values have been recently 
reported for Cu26V2Sn6S32 with 0.9 at 700 K (Bourgès et al. 2018), for 
Cu26Cr2Ge6S32 also with 0.9 at 700 K (Pavan Kumar et al. 2019), as well as 
for Cu26Ta2Sn5.5S32 and Cu26Nb2Ge6S32, both with zTmax = 1.0 at 670 K 
(Bouyrie et al. 2017).  
The tetrahedrites Cu12-xMxSb4S13 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Hg) have 
attracted the most attention among the copper sulfide minerals. In addition to 
their large complex unit cells, one Cu atom is bonded to only three S atoms 
instead of the more common four S atoms in a tetrahedral conformation, and 
the Sb–S polyhedra are highly distorted because of the lone pair effect of 

Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides     79 
Sb3+. The resulting large anharmonicity reflects itself in a low lattice thermal 
conductivity of typically below 0.6 W m–1K–1. With x = 2, Cu12-xZnxSb4S13 is 
an intrinsic semiconductor and a p-doped semiconductor when x < 2. 
Cu11MnSb4S13 was the first tetrahedrite to surpass a zT of unity, with  
zTmax = 1.1 at 575 K (Heo et al. 2014).  
3.3.2. Tl-containing copper and silver chalcogenides 
The first representative of a thallium silver chalcogenide with high TE 
performance was TlAg9Te5 with zTmax = 1.2 at 700 K (Kurosaki et al. 2005a). 
This material crystallizes in a complex unit cell of large hexagonal channels 
formed by the Ag and Te atoms filled with chains of Tl atoms. The Ag sites 
are highly disordered with occupancies between 46% and 88% (Paccard  
et al. 1992), leading to enhanced phonon scattering and thus lower thermal 
conductivity.  
Similar channels exist in the structure of Tl2Ag12-xTe7.4, which is a variant 
of the Zr2Fe12P7 type. Therein, Ag site occupancies are generally higher than 
in TlAg9Te5. In contrast to TlAg9Te5, Tl2Ag12-xTe7.4 forms a composite 
structure, where composite A is the Tl2Ag12Te6 framework and composite B 
is an incommensurate Te atom chain with ~1.4 Te atoms per Tl2Ag12Te6 
unit. This linear Te chain consists of a modulation of Te2
2– and Te3
4– units, 
which in turn also distorts the neighboring Ag atoms. Finally, the composite 
structure with its distortions and deficiencies leads to an ultralow thermal 
conductivity of < 0.3 W m–1K–1, and a peak zT value of 1.1 at 520 K. In both 
cases, TlAg9Te5 and Tl2Ag12-xTe7.4, three-dimensionally extended Ag–Ag 
contacts < 3.3 Å are present. In addition to the site deficiencies, Ag ion 
conductivity cannot be excluded, but reproducibility measurements revealed 
no stability problems in the case of Tl2Ag12-xTe7.4 (Shi et al. 2018).  
3.3.3. Ba-containing copper and silver chalcogenides 
Twenty years ago, the low-temperature TE properties of A2BaCu8Te10 
(with A = K, Rb, Cs) were determined (Patschke et al. 2001). Its complex 
crystal structure consists of Ba-filled pentagonal dodecahedral Cu8Te12 
cages, Te2– anions, as well as Te2
2–dumbbells and A cations with enlarged 
anisotropic displacement parameters. Rb2BaCu8Te10 has an optical band gap 
of Eg = 0.28 eV and a low thermal conductivity of κ = 1.4 W m–1K–1 at  
300 K.  

80     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
Also in 2001, the first ternary barium copper telluride was introduced, 
namely BaCu2Te2, and its low-temperature TE properties were presented 
(Wang and DiSalvo 2001). BaCu2Te2 is isostructural with α-BaCu2S2 and 
BaCu2Se2, with double chains of edge-sharing CuTe4 tetrahedra running 
along the b axis. These columns are interconnected via corner sharing to 
form a three-dimensional network of CuTe4 tetrahedra with Ba cations in 
their channels (see Figure 3.4). The as-prepared BaCu2Te2 is a degenerate 
semiconductor, indicating unidentified Cu atom deficiencies, with a thermal 
conductivity of 2.3 W m–1K–1 at 300 K.  
 
Figure 3.4. Crystal structure of BaCu2Te2 
Over a decade later, BaCu2Te2 was shown to reach a peak zT value of 
0.72 at 823 K, and BaCu1.9Ag0.1Te2 a zTmax value of 1.1 at 823 K, partly  
due to its lower thermal conductivity of 0.6 W m–1K–1 at 300 K and  
0.5 W m–1K–1 at 823 K (Yang et al. 2019). The addition of more Cu to this 
material, corresponding to a nominal formula of BaCu2.04Te2, lowered the 
room temperature thermal conductivity from 0.9 W m–1K–1 to 0.7 W m–1K–1 
after the formation of nano-precipitates with a size of 20–50 nm. Therefore, 
a superior zTmax = 1.3 is achieved at 833 K (Guo et al. 2020).  

Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides     81 
The corresponding sulfide BaCu2S2, which in its β-modification adopts 
the ThCr2Si2 type at elevated temperatures, is less competitive. After doping 
with K, it reaches a modest zTmax of 0.28 at 820 K (Kurosaki et al. 2005b). 
More recently, the doping of the selenide BaCu2Se2 with sodium yielded a 
competitive zTmax of 1.0 at 773 K with a thermal conductivity of 
approximately 1 W m–1K–1 at room temperature (Li et al. 2015).  
On the contrary, the as-prepared Ag telluride, BaAg2Te2, is an intrinsic 
semiconductor with low electrical conductivity. Conductivity increases in 
the solid solution of BaCuxAg2-xTe2 with increasing x (Cu concentration), 
presumably due to the increasing Cu atom deficiencies (Assoud et al. 2008). 
Superior performance was achieved at a Cu:Ag ratio of 1:1, corresponding to 
BaCuAgTe2, with its zTmax = 1.3 at 823 K (Tang et al. 2022).  
A more complex, low symmetry structure is adopted by Ba3Cu14-xTe12, 
which forms its own structure type (Assoud et al. 2006). As with BaCu2Te2, 
the structure consists of a three-dimensionally extended network of Cu–Te 
polyhedra. In addition to the common CuTe4 tetrahedra of BaCu2Te2, 
Ba3Cu14-xTe12 also contains CuTe3 triangles as well as Te2
2- dumbbells (see 
Figure 3.5).  
 
Figure 3.5. Crystal structure of Ba3Cu14-xTe12 

82     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
Ba3Cu14-xTe12 is an electron-precise material for x = 0, as can be seen 
from the formula (Ba2+)3(Cu+)14(Te2
2–)2(Te2–)8. With always x > 0 and x as 
large as 0.875, Ba3Cu14-xTe12 exhibits extrinsic p-type semiconducting 
properties. Like many of the materials discussed here, this material has a low 
thermal conductivity below 1.0 W m–1K–1, but suffers from stability issues as 
a result of Cu ion migration at elevated temperatures. Therefore, repeat 
measurements result in non-reproducible data. In addition, relatively low 
Seebeck values occur with a small figure of merit, with zTmax of the order of 
only 0.1 (Sturm et al. 2021).  
The addition of sulfur or selenium to the mixture has resulted in a number 
of unprecedented crystal structures, including Ba2Cu4-xSeyTe5-y (Mayasree  
et al. 2010), Ba3Cu16-xS11-yTey (Kuropatwa et al. 2011) and Ba3Cu16-xSe11-yTey 
(Kuropatwa et al. 2009), and BaCu6-xSTe6 and BaCu6-xSe1-yTe6+y (Mayasree 
et al. 2011). With the exception of Ba2Cu4-xSeyTe5-y, the TE properties of all 
of these sulfide-tellurides and selenide-tellurides have recently been 
determined.  
Ba3Cu16-xS11-yTey and Ba3Cu16-xSe11-yTey adopt the same rhombohedral 
structure with Cu26 clusters and CuQ4 tetrahedra (Q = S, Se, Te). Cu26 
clusters are interconnected through Cu–Cu contacts to form a  
three-dimensional network of Cu atoms, most of which have significant 
deficiencies (see Figure 3.6). Pure S (or Se), mixed Q and pure Te sites exist 
in this structure, resulting in a significant phase range for y.  
 
Figure 3.6. Crystal structure of Ba3Cu16-xSe11-yTey, emphasizing the Cu26 clusters 

Thermoelectric Copper and Silver Chalcogenides     83 
Both the sulfide-telluride and the selenide-telluride are p-type 
semiconductors, according to the balanced formula (Ba2+)3(Cu+)16(Q2–)11, for 
x is always > 0. As expected, thermal conductivity values are low, which are 
consistently below 0.6 W m–1K–1 for sulfide-telluride (Jafarzadeh et al. 2018) 
and below 0.7 W m–1K–1 for selenide-telluride (Jafarzadeh et al. 2019). 
Repeat measurements showed that the sulfide-telluride remains stable under 
the measurement conditions, while the selenide-telluride does not. The 
instability of the selenide-telluride is caused by irreversible changes in the 
Cu site occupancies and can be inhibited by reducing the maximum 
temperature below 600 K. The best performing representative of these 
rhombohedral materials is Ba3Cu16-xS11-yTey with a competitive zTmax = 0.88 
at 745 K.  
BaCu6-xSTe6 and BaCu6-xSe1-yTe6+y are isostructural, crystallizing in a 
relatively small cubic unit cell with distinct sites of the S/Se and Te 
positions, while some Te can replace Se in the latter case. The structure of 
BaCu6-xSeTe6 consists of Cu-deficient Cu cubes, centered by Se atoms and 
interconnected by Te2
2– dumbbells (Figure 3.7). As with A2BaCu8Te10, Ba 
atoms are located in pentagonal Cu8Te12 dodecahedra.  
 
Figure 3.7. Crystal structure of BaCu6-xSeTe6 

84     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
Charge balance may be hypothetically achieved according to 
(Ba2+)(Cu+)6(Se2–)(Te2
2–)3 when x = 0. Despite the small unit cell, low 
conductivity values below 0.7 W m–1K–1 are obtained because of the large 
Cu site defects, as less than 6 Cu positions per cube are occupied. In contrast 
to the above-mentioned examples, Cu atoms are not three-dimensionally 
connected. Cu cubes are separated from each other by Ba and Te atoms, 
which reduce Cu ion conductivity. Consequently, these materials do not 
experience stability problems caused by Cu ion migration. The best 
performance achieved so far was by BaCu5.9SeTe6 with zTmax = 0.81 at  
600 K (Oudah et al. 2015). Higher temperatures cannot be tested as the 
material decomposes into binary and ternary chalcogenides above 650 K.  
Figure 3.8 compares the leading barium copper chalcogenides. In 
addition to the common features of the p-type extrinsic semiconductor and 
low thermal conductivity, the figure of merit curves are very comparable. 
Finally, BaCu2.04Te2 has the highest zT values because its thermal stability is 
the highest in this group, enabling measurements up to 850 K.

3.4. Conclusion 
Investigations into the various copper and silver chalcogenides continue 
to result in further improvements, both with respect to their TE properties 
and their long-term stability.  
This is of particular importance for TE energy conversion, because it 
restricts the use of the expensive, rare and toxic element tellurium, as many 
sulfides and selenides exhibit superior performance.

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: 
Materials and Modules

Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan 
4.1. Introduction 
A large number of materials that offer various benefits such as  
high-performance, high-temperature operation and high mechanical strength 
have been developed for thermoelectric applications. Among them, sulfides 
are promising candidates for environmental-friendly and cost-effective 
thermoelectrics due to the following reasons: firstly, sulfur is an earth-abundant 
element; secondly, the electronegativity of sulfur is lower in the oxygen 
family (oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium); thus, the electrical 
resistivity (ρ) of sulfides are generally low; thirdly, a reduction in the lattice 
thermal conductivity (κl) for sulfides has been demonstrated through various 
strategies to suppress phonon propagation, despite sulfur’s low atomic mass. 
For example, complex crystal structure, defects and disorder, and liquid-like 
behavior in sulfide result in the low lattice thermal conductivity. The low ρ 
(second reason) and low κl (third reason) result in a high thermoelectric 
figure of merit (zT).

Firstly, this chapter discusses the recent progress in thermoelectric sulfides, 
including rare-earth sulfides, layered sulfides, Pb–Bi–S-based systems, Cu  
and Ag sulfides-based superionic conductors, Cu–S-based tetrahedrites and 
colusites, Chevrel-phase sulfides and chalcopyrites. Secondly, this chapter 
addresses recent attempts to develop thermoelectric modules based on these 
sulfides for waste heat recovery. Finally, the chapter concludes with a brief 
overview of future opportunities and potential challenges in the field of 
sulfide thermoelectric performance enhancement and application. This 
chapter is recommended to be studied in conjunction with the previously 
published review articles to gain a better understanding of thermoelectric 
sulfides (Jood and Ohta 2015; Suekuni and Takabatake 2016; Hébert et al. 
2016; Powell 2019; Guélou et al. 2021). 
4.2. Materials 
4.2.1. Rare-earth sulfides 
Rare-earth sesqui-chalcogenides, Ln2Ch3 (Ln: rare-earth element, Ch: 
chalcogen), with a cubic Th3P4-type structure (γ-phase) are promising n-type 
high-temperature thermoelectric materials studied for more than half a 
century due to their high melting point, defect structure and self-doping 
ability (Cutler et al. 1964; Gschneidner et al. 1987; Wood 1988; Gschneidner 
1998). This section mainly focuses on the preparation and high-temperature 
thermoelectric properties of γ-phase in rare-earth sulfides γ-Ln2S3 among 
rare-earth chalcogenides. Furthermore, γ-Ln2S3 has a high melting point; for 
example, the melting point of γ-Pr2+xS3 is about 2,300 K (Gschneidner 1992). 
Therefore, this system is suited for high-temperature applications due to its 
high zT at a high-temperature and melting point. 
Various methods are used to synthesize rare-earth sulfides, including the 
direct reaction of the elemental components and sulfurization of the  
rare-earth oxides/salts with C2S or H2S gases (Gschneidner et al. 1987; 
Gschneidner 1998; Henderson et al. 1967; Toide et al. 1973; Guittard and 
Flahaut 1991; Hirai et al. 1998, 2003; Ohta et al. 2004, 2009a, 2009b; Yuan 
et al. 2010). The physical properties of rare-earth sulfides with different 
chemical compositions can be studied using a direct reaction of the 
components that can be precisely controlled (Gschneidner et al. 1987; 
Gschneidner 1998). Alternatively, the CS2 or H2S sulfurization processes 
could be employed for industrial-scale production. The value of the standard 
free-energy change, ΔG, for CS2 sulfurization of rare-earth oxides is lower 

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: Materials and Modules     95 
than that for H2S sulfurization of rare-earth oxides over the temperature 
range of 600–1,300 K (Henderson et al. 1967; Hirai et al. 1998, 2003; Ohta 
et al. 2004). This implies that CS2 gas is a powerful sulfurizing agent for 
rare-earth oxides, allowing the low-temperature formation of rare-earth 
sulfides. 
The γ-Ln2S3 compounds contain vacancies randomly distributed over 
cation sites (Flahaut et al. 1979). The self-doping ability arises because the 
vacancies can be filled with additional Ln atoms. Therefore, the γ-phases are 
formed over a compositional range between Ln2V0.25S3 (V: vacancy) and 
Ln2.25S3. Because one Ln3+ ion contributes three electrons and one S2− ion 
accepts two electrons, Ln self-doping allows for the tuning of the carrier 
concentration, improving the thermoelectric power factor. Figure 4.1(a)–(c) 
shows the electrical resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient and power factor 
versus chemical x in Ln2+xS3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.25) (Takeshita et al. 1985; Wood  
et al. 1985; Gadzhiev et al. 2000; Ohta et al. 2008, 2011; Ohta and Hirai 
2009). The Seebeck coefficient (see Figure 4.1(a)) and electrical resistivity  
(see Figure 4.1(b)) decrease as x increases. The electrical resistivity and the 
Seebeck coefficient in La2+xS3 decrease from ~100 μΩ m and ~−230 μW K−1 
to ~10 μΩ m and ~−95 μW K−1, respectively, at 1,400 K as Ln content 
increases from 0.03 to 0.22. The power factor is improved by changing the 
Ln content (see Figure 4.1(c)). A power factor of ~970 μW m−1 K2 is 
obtained for La2.17S3 at 1,400 K. The carrier concentration can also be tuned 
by occupying the vacancies with divalent rare-earth (e.g. Sm, Eu and Yb) 
and alkaline earth (e.g. Ca and Ba) metals, which improves the power factor 
(Nakahara et al. 1988; Katsuyama et al. 1997). 
Moreover, the numerous randomly distributed Ln vacancies result in 
effective phonon scattering, yielding total and low lattice thermal 
conductivity (Snyder and Toberer 2008). Figure 4.1(d) shows the 
temperature dependence of total thermal conductivity (Wood et al. 1985; 
Gadzhiev et al. 2000; Ohta and Hirai 2009; Ohta et al. 2011). The total 
thermal conductivity for all samples is less than 4.0 W m−1 K−1. The lattice 
thermal conductivity, κl, in La2.03S3 at 1,400 K, which was calculated by 
subtracting the electronic thermal conductivity, κe, from the total thermal 
conductivity, κ (κl = κ−κe), is 0.83 W m−1 K−1, where the carrier thermal 
conductivity was estimated from the electrical resistivity, ρ, using the 
Wiedemann–Franz law with the Lorenz number, L, of 2.45 × 10−8 W Ω K−2 
(κe = LT/ρ).

Figure 4.1(e) shows the temperature dependence of zT. The zT value was 
optimized via chemical composition tuning. In Gd2+xS3 at 1,270 K, the zT 
value has a maximum (zT ~ 0.8) at x = 0.03.

4.2.2. Layered sulfides 
The two-dimensional crystal structure of layered systems such as TiS2 
and misfit-layered sulfides [MS]1+m[TS2]n (where M = Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi and 
rare-earth metals; T = Ti, V, Cr, Nb and Ta; n = 1, 2, 3) provides an ideal 
platform for simultaneously regulating electrical and thermal transports 
(Jood and Ohta 2015; Koyano et al. 1986; Wiegers 1996; Logothetis et al. 
1980). These materials are a perfect example of the renowned phonon  
glass-electron crystal behavior (PGEC) proposed by Slack (1995). The 
research on layered sulfides gained traction after Han and Cook (1994) 
discovered a high power factor of ~1,500 µW m‒1 K‒2 at 300 K for  
Ti1+xS2 alloy, and Imai et al. (2001) later reported a high power factor of 
~3,710 µW m‒1 K‒2 at 300 K in a near-stoichiometric TiS2 single crystal (see 
Table 4.1). However, the zT ~0.16 at 300 K in the in-plane direction 
remained low due to the high lattice thermal conductivity of ~6.4 W m‒1 K‒1. 
Most research was then focused on decreasing the polycrystalline TiS2 
system’s lattice thermal conductivity, while simultaneously tuning the carrier 
concentration by intercalating guest atoms (such as Ti, Cu, Co and Ag) 
(Guilmeau et al. 2011; Ohta et al. 2012; Beaumale et al. 2014; Barbier et al. 
2015; Guélou et al. 2016; Guilmeau et al. 2017) or rock salt type MS layers 
(where M = Pb, Bi and Sn) (Wan et al. 2010, 2011, 2012; Putri et al. 2013; 
Yin et al. 2018) into the van der Waals gap of the host TiS6 octahedral 
layers, pushing the zT close to ~0.5 at 823 K (for Cu0.1TiS2 in the in-plane 
direction (see Table 4.1) (Guilmeau et al. 2011, 2017)). The host TiS2 layer 
in the intercalated TiS2 provides a high Seebeck coefficient, and the electron 
pathway (i.e. low electrical resistivity) and MS layer reduces the lattice 
thermal conductivity due to increased lattice disorder. The interfaces between 
the layers scatter both the charge carriers and heat-carrying phonons, making 
these layered systems have anisotropic transport properties. Texture 
engineering in TiS2 has been recently reported to increase the zT to ~0.7 at 
673 K (zT ~ 0.15 at 300 K) in the in-plane direction due to the 20% reduced 
lattice thermal conductivity arising from intensified grain boundary phonon 
scattering (see Table 4.1) (Gu et al. 2020). Alternatively, ionized impurity 
scattering was introduced by forming TiS2–AgSnSe2 composites, enabling a 
high power factor (~ 1,550 µW m‒1 K‒2) at 700 K while achieving low lattice 
thermal conductivity (~1.0 W m‒1 K‒1 at 700 K). A high zT of ∼0.8 at 700 K  
 
 
 
 

98     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
was reported for TiS2–4%AgSnSe2 composite (see Table 4.1) (Wang et al. 
2018). Flexible hybrid organic/TiS2 superlattices have been fabricated 
possessing an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of ~0.12 W m‒1 K‒1 and a 
promising zT of ~0.28 at 373 K, creating the opportunity for layered sulfides 
to be used in flexible thermoelectric devices (see Table 4.1) (Wan et al. 
2015; Tian et al. 2017). 
The other family of misfit-layered sulfides ([MS]1+m[TS2]n, T = V, Cr, Nb 
and Ta), unlike TiS2-based layered sulfides, has received little attention for 
their thermoelectric properties and only a few reports exist so far on 
([MS]1+mTS2, M = lanthanide series, T = Cr, Nb) (Miyazaki et al. 2004, 
2013; Jood et al. 2014, 2015; Sotnikov et al. 2020). However, their crystal 
structure and physical properties were extensively studied in the 1990s 
(Wiegers 1996). Among all compounds in the LnS-based series, 
[Yb1.90S2]0.62NbS2 shows the highest power factor (~250 µW m‒1 K‒2) and zT 
(~0.11) at 300 K due to the low carrier concentration (high Seebeck 
coefficient) attributable to Yb deficiency from the distorted atomic 
arrangement (see Table 4.1) (Miyazaki et al. 2004, 2013). 
Misfit compounds are highly sensitive to microstructural engineering 
because of the anisotropic nature of their atomic bonds. Therefore, zT can be 
enhanced by tuning the microstructure, as was achieved for (LaS)1+mTS2  
(T = Nb, Cr) by varying the sulfurization duration from 6 to 12 h, followed 
by pressure-assisted sintering to obtain samples with randomly and highly 
oriented textures (Jood et al. 2014). The highly oriented texture produced the 
highest in-plane zT of ~0.14 at 950 K among the (LaS)1.20CrS2 systems, 
whereas the weakly/randomly oriented texture produced the highest in-plane 
zT of ~0.15 at 950 K among the (LaS)1.14NbS2 systems. Disorder and defects 
in the LaS layer, such as strain-induced stacking disorder, were observed in 
both CrS2- and NbS2-based compounds (Jood et al. 2014, 2015). These 
defects could be further tuned via chemical composition tuning. For 
example, the best structural and long-range ordering was found in the La rich 
sample, (La1.05S1.05)1.14NbS2, which resulted in a highly textured grain growth 
in-plane, pushing the in-plane zT to about ~0.2 at 950 K (see Table 4.1) 
(Jood et al. 2015).

4.2.3. Pb–Bi–S-based systems 
Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) and lead sulfide (PbS) are known as the family of 
well-studied/high-performance Bi2Te3 and PbTe. PbS has the same rock salt 
structure as PbTe and a slightly higher bandgap, Eg, of ~0.41 eV (PbTe:  
Eg ~ 0.32 eV) (Scanlon et al. 1959). Although PbS shows a slightly lower  
 
 

100     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
power factor and higher lattice thermal conductivity than PbTe, it can be 
useful in avoiding the use of Te, which is in short supply. The terrestrial 
abundance of sulfur (3.5 × 105 ppb) significantly exceeds that of tellurium  
(1 ppb). Moreover, PbS has been studied for higher temperature applications 
due to the large Eg and high melting point, Tm, of PbS (Tm ~ 1,391 K for PbS, 
Tm ~ 1,197 K for PbTe). The thermoelectric performance was enhanced by 
nanostructuring and substitutions/interstitials (Johnsen et al. 2011; Zhao  
et al. 2011; Qin et al. 2021); zT of ~1.2 was obtained in Pb0.99Cu0.01S-0.01Cu 
at 773 K (Qin et al. 2021). Because PbS has the same crystal structure as 
PbTe/PbSe, alloying with these compounds (Pb(S, Se, Te) alloys) boosts the 
thermoelectric performance (Girard et al. 2011; Korkosz et al. 2014; Wu  
et al. 2014). 
Bi2S3 has also been investigated from the perspective of environmental 
friendliness and cost-effectiveness of sulfides. Although Bi2Te3 shows a high 
thermoelectric performance among all thermoelectric materials, it has some 
limitations in the operating temperature. Similar to the renowned Bi2Te3, 
Bi2S3 possesses low lattice thermal conductivity (~0.5 W m‒1 K‒1 at 500 K) 
based on its complex crystal structure (Biswas et al. 2012). However, the 
thermoelectric performance is limited by the relatively low intrinsic carrier 
concentration (<1018 cm‒3) and large bandgap (Eg ~ 1.3 eV) due to the strong 
bonding between Bi and S. Manipulating the carrier concentration was 
achieved in several investigations by controlling sulfur vacancies 
(Mizoguchi et al. 1995) or using metallic and halogen dopants (Guo et al. 
2020a, 2020b). These efforts result in zT of about 0.8 at 760 K with the 
micro/nanostructured polycrystalline Bi2S3 (Ji et al. 2021). 
The Pb–Bi–S-based systems – such as PbBi2S4, Pb3Bi2S6 and CdPb2Bi4S9 
(Ohta et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2019a; Cai et al. 2021) – have recently received 
attention. PbBi2S4, Pb3Bi2S6 and CdPb2Bi4S9 are part of the galenobismutite, 
lillianite and pavonite homologous series respectively (Mrotzek and 
Kanatzidis 2003b; Makovicky 2006; Zhao et al. 2019a). Table 4.2 
summaries the thermoelectric properties of PbBi2S4, Pb3Bi2S6, InPbBi3S7 and 
CdPb2Bi4S9 (Ohta et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2019a; Cai et al. 2021). The 
negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient confirms n-type (electron) carrier 
transport in all samples. Moreover, both electrical resistivity and the Seebeck 
coefficient increase monotonically with temperature for all samples, which is 
consistent with a degenerate semiconducting behavior. PbBi2S4 was 
discovered to have a high power factor of ~370 µW m‒1 K‒2 at 800 K. The 
complex structure of these homologous compounds yields low lattice 
thermal conductivity, resulting in high zT (see Table 4.2). The lattice thermal 

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: Materials and Modules     101 
conductivity and zT of PbBi2S4 were ~0.4 W·m−1·K−1 and ~0.46 at 800 K 
respectively (Cai et al. 2021). The crystal structural evolution would 
optimize the electrical and thermal transport properties in homologous series 
of compounds (Mrotzek and Kanatzidis 2003a; Kanatzidis 2005), increasing 
the zT value.

4.2.4. Cu and Ag sulfide-based superionic conductors 
Ag2S is a superionic conductor with a bandgap around 1.1 eV (at room 
temperature) (Kashida et al. 2003); however, the mixed conduction of 
electrons and Ag ions is mainly prevalent above 451 K (in high-temperature 
cubic phase) (Miyatami 1968). The room temperature modification of Ag2S 
(α-phase) is monoclinic with space group P21/c and is stable up to 451 K, 
above which it undergoes a transition to a body-centered cubic structure, 
which is stable between 449 K and 895 K (Shi et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2020). 
A face-centered cubic structure is formed at higher temperatures. The crystal 
structure in silver chalcogenides can be tuned to obtain the desired 
mechanical and thermoelectric properties, allowing for the formation of an 
optimized thermoelectric material (Liang et al. 2019; Jood et al. 2020). For 
example, depending on the S/Se atomic ratio, Ag2(S, Se) compound 
crystallizes into an orthorhombic or monoclinic crystal structure with 
different mechanical and electrical properties (Liang et al. 2020). 

102     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
Pristine Ag2S is limited by its low electron concentration (order of  
1014 cm–3) at room temperature, which has recently been significantly 
improved (Liang et al. 2019, 2020; Wang et al. 2021a). Se and Te alloying 
minimize the defect formation energy of Ag interstitials, which significantly 
improves the electrical conductivity and zT in the 300–450 K range, making 
them promising for room temperature applications (Liang et al. 2019). For 
example, zT of ~0.44 for Ag2S0.5Se0.45Te0.05 and ~0.63 for Ag2S0.8Te0.2 at  
300 K and 450 K, respectively, were achieved compared with zT < 0.001 for 
pristine Ag2S at 300 K. Recently, a new ductile semiconductor, Ag20S7Te3, 
was found to have a zT of ~0.80 at 600 K while still maintaining good 
flexibility and plastic deformability as monoclinic α-Ag2S (Yang et al. 
2021). In contrast to other inorganic semiconductors, α-Ag2S has metal-like 
ductility with significant plastic deformation stresses (~4.2% elongation for 
tension, above 50% for compression and above 20% for bending) due to its 
distinctive structural and chemical bonding properties (Shi et al. 2018). 
Silver chalcogenides-based compounds are extremely appealing for flexible 
thermoelectric device development due to their unique mechanical properties 
and strong thermoelectric performance, as mentioned in a later section. 
Cu2−xS is a superionic mixed ionic–electronic conductor investigated for 
decades, particularly for its complex structure and solar cell applications due 
to its relatively small bandgap around 1.2 eV. Copper sulfide has 
complicated crystal structures at a low-temperature and two phase transitions 
at 370 K and 700 K (Chakrabarti and Laughlin 1983). Copper sulfide crystal 
structure is a monoclinic low chalcocite γ-phase (L-Chalcocite) at 370 K. It 
becomes hexagonal high chalcocite β-phase (H-Chalcocite) in the 
temperature range of 370–700 K, which has been reported as a solid–liquid 
hybrid phase with copper in the liquid-like substructure. Furthermore, when 
the temperature is higher than 700 K, it transforms into the face-centered 
cubic (fcc) α-phase, which is a superionic phase that has mobile copper ions 
in the structure. These liquid-like copper ions in a sulfide sublattice play a 
significant role in achieving an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity, 
resulting in high thermoelectric performance. 
Cu2−xS has recently attracted attention as thermoelectric materials with 
the “phonon-liquid electron-crystal” (PLEC) concept (Liu et al. 2012; 
Dennler et al. 2014; Ge et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2019b). Cu2S is a major 
research subject in the field of thermoelectrics due to its intriguing thermal 
and electrical transport properties, such as reduced specific heat and 
extremely low lattice thermal conductivity (below 0.35 W m‒1 K‒1). 
Although ideal Cu2S is an intrinsic semiconductor, the sample with a 

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: Materials and Modules     103 
nominal Cu2S composition shows p-type behavior due to the Cu deficiency. 
The hole carrier concentration can be tuned by changing the Cu content, and 
the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, of Cu2−xS can reach above 1.5. For 
example, zT was improved from ~0.65 for Cu2S to ~1.7 for Cu1.97S at 1,000 K 
(He et al. 2014). 
4.2.5. Tetrahedrites and colusites 
Tetrahedrites (Cu12Sb4S13) and colusites (Cu26A2E6S32; A: V, Nb, Ta, Cr, 
Mo, W; E: Sn, Ge) have received significant attention as emerging p-type 
thermoelectric materials. Both systems are mainly composed of the  
earth-abundant and low-toxicity elements, Cu and S. The tetrahedrites possess 
a cubic structure (space group: I4ത3m), consisting of a CuS4 tetrahedron, CuS3 
trigonal planar unit and SbS3 trigonal pyramid (Suekuni and Takabatake 
2016). The colusites is composed of numerous atoms (66) in the cubic unit cell 
(P4ത3n) (Suekuni and Takabatake 2016), consisting of AS4 tetrahedron, CuS4 
tetrahedra and ES4 tetrahedra (Suekuni and Takabatake 2016). 
Tetrahedrites and colusites have a high power factor because their 
valence bands are mainly composed of hybridized Cu 3D and S 3P orbitals 
(Suekuni et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2015; Suekuni and Takabatake 2016). In 
tetrahedrites, three-fold coordinated Cu atoms vibrate anharmonically 
perpendicular to the triangular plane of S atoms (Suekuni et al. 2013, 2018; 
Lu et al. 2013). The lattice thermal conductivity was suppressed by this  
out-of-plane vibration. In colusites, the low lattice thermal conductivity is 
due to the structural complexity and low-frequency vibration of Cu atoms 
(Suekuni et al. 2014; Bourgès et al. 2018). The lattice thermal conductivity is 
further reduced by introducing various types of defects into the crystal 
structure, such as interstitial defects, antisite defects between cations and 
split Cu sites (Kikuchi et al. 2016; Bourgès et al. 2018; Suekuni et al. 2019; 
Bouyrie et al. 2020; Shimizu et al. 2021). These defects are formed through 
sulfur losses when the samples are heated above 973 K. 
Table 4.3 summarizes several significant breakthroughs in the 
thermoelectric properties of tetrahedrites and colusites. For tetrahedrites, a 
high power factor and low lattice thermal conductivity were observed at 
room temperature for Cu10Tr2Sb4S13 (Tr: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) in 2012 
(Suekuni et al. 2012). After a year, high zT values were obtained at a high 
temperature; for example, zT of ~0.7 at 665 K and ~0.95 at 700 K have been 
obtained for Cu10.5Ni1.5Sb4S13 and Cu11.5Zn0.5Sb4S13 respectively (Lu et al. 

104     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
2013; Suekuni et al. 2013). The zT value was further enhanced to over 1.0 
by tuning the chemical composition (Lu et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2018) and 
inserting a porous network in sintered samples (Hu et al. 2021). For 
colusites, Cu26V2Ge6S32 was reported in 2014 to have a zT of ~0.73 at 660 K 
due to a high power factor and low lattice thermal conductivity (Suekuni  
et al. 2014). The zT value was recently improved to over 1.0 by tuning the 
carrier concentration and introducing various types of defects into the crystal 
structure (Bouyrie et al. 2017).

4.2.6. Chevrel-phase sulfides 
Chevrel-phase chalcogenides have attracted significant attention for many 
years due to their remarkable superconducting properties, including a large 
critical magnetic field and high critical superconducting transition 
temperature (Perrin et al. 2019). The interest in the thermoelectric properties 
of Chevrel-phase chalcogenides has recently increased due to the high zT at 
high temperatures (Roche et al. 1998; Caillat et al. 1999; Tsubota et al.  
1999; Zhou et al. 2011; Gougeon et al. 2012). The general formula of  
Chevrel-phase chalcogenides is MxMo6Ch8 (M: Metal; Ch: S, Se and Te). 
The crystal structure consists of stacked Mo6Ch8 building blocks. Metal, M, 
ions fill the cavities between the Mo6Ch8 building blocks.

Table 4.4. Recently reported electrical resistivity, ρ, Seebeck coefficient,  
S, power factor, S2/ρ, total thermal conductivity, κ and thermoelectric  
figure of merit, zT, of Chevrel-phase sulfides 
Table 4.4 summarizes the recently reported thermoelectric properties of 
Chevrel-phase sulfides (Ohta et al. 2009c, 2010; Gougeon et al. 2021). The 
optimization in the guest M content results in the tuning of carrier 
concentration, boosting the high power factor. For CuxMo6S8, the power 
factor was boosted from ~440 μW K−2 m−1 for x = 2.5 to ~810 μW K−2 m−1 
for x = 4.0 at 950 K. The low lattice thermal conductivity is most likely due 
to the rattling of guest M ions. The lattice thermal conductivity of  
CuxMo6S8 at 950 K is ~2.0 W m‒1 K‒1. The high power factor and low lattice  
 

106     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
thermal conductivity result in high zT in the Chevrel-phase sulfides. The zT 
obtained for Cu4.0Mo6S8 at 950 K is ~0.4. The building blocks evolve from 
Mo6S8 to Mo9S11 and Mo12S14, and can be represented by the general formula 
Mo3nS3n+2 (n ≥ 2) (Perrin et al. 2019). The giant building block is expected to 
improve zT by reducing the low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice 
thermal conductivity of Ag3Tl2Mo15S19 at 950 K is ~1.5 W m‒1 K‒1⋅ 
(Gougeon et al. 2021). However, only a few research works on the 
thermoelectric properties of n > 2 systems have been reported. The n ≥ 2 
systems would be good areas to seek for high zT materials. 
4.2.7. Chalcopyrite 
Chalcopyrite is a compound with the ABX2 (A = Ag, Cu; B = Al, Ga, In, 
Fe, Tl; X = S, Se, Te) composition (Austin et al. 1956; Jaffe and Zunger 
1983; Li et al. 2014). As sulfide materials, n-type CuFeS2 (Li et al. 2013) and 
p-type CuAlS2, (Liu et al. 2007a, 2007b) have been studied as potential 
thermoelectric materials composed of cost-effective and earth-abundant 
elements. A natural mineral composed of chalcopyrite CuFeS2 that exists at 
a deep-sea hydrothermal vent can demonstrate thermoelectricity as proof of 
the environmentally friendly characteristics of chalcopyrite phases (Ang  
et al. 2015). 
CuFeS2 can be synthesized chemically or by combining mechanical 
alloying and high-temperature densification (Li et al. 2013, 2014).  
The system is expected to be suitable for low- to mid-temperature 
thermoelectric applications, with a bandgap of ~0.53 eV (Austin et al. 1956) 
or 0.3 eV (Hamajima et al. 1981) determined by optical absorption 
measurement and calculation respectively. In terms of CuFeS2 stability, 
thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis showed the decomposition 
of the chalcopyrite phase into an isometric (Cu, Fe)S phase and pyrite FeS2 
around 800 K (Tsujii et al. 2014). The power factor of n-type CuFeS2 was 
enhanced to ~1 mW m−1 K−2 via Zn doping on Cu site or optimizing Fe 
content in the range of 400–600 K (Tsujii et al. 2014). CuFeS1.80 and Mn/ 
Co-doped compositions achieved a maximum zT value of ~ 0.2 at 600 K  
(Li et al. 2013; Lefèvre et al. 2016). In comparison to other systems with 
ionic conduction issues, CuFeS2 has a substantially lower ionic conduction 
with Cu migration (Wang et al. 2021b). Furthermore, CuFeS2 bulk materials 
have intriguing optical and magnetic properties. Magnetism has been 
indicated to enhance the thermoelectric properties (Tsujii and Mori 2013). 

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: Materials and Modules     107 
Because p-type CuAlS2 has the widest bandgap (𝐸𝑔) among ABX2 
chalcopyrite compounds, it has been explored as a promising light-emitting 
material or transparent semiconductor for a long time (Liu et al. 2007a, 
2007b). The bandgap 𝐸𝑔 (~3.0 eV) of CuAlS2 estimated from the optical 
absorption spectrum decreases as the dopant concentration of Zn increases 
(Liu et al. 2007a). Although n-type CuFeS2 still has a substantially low zT 
value, several efforts have been made to improve its thermoelectric 
performance, such as making a composite with carbon nanotube (Shojaei  
et al. 2022). 
4.3. Modules 
Sulfide-based thermoelectric power generation modules are now being 
fabricated. The most critical factor in fabricating modules is to achieve 
stable operation under temperature differences. The temperature gradient in 
the module can cause a chemical reaction and/or atomic diffusion in the 
thermoelectric legs and/or at the interface between the electrodes and the 
legs under the temperature difference, resulting in module degradation and 
conversion efficiency reduction (Zebarjadi et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016; He 
et al. 2018; Tan et al. 2019). Efforts have been made to improve the 
module’s stability. 
4.3.1. Colusites 
This section describes the advancements in the fabrication of power 
generation devices based on colusites. The Cu26Nb2Ge6S32-based elements 
with metal contact layers (Ti, Pt, Ni or Au) were fabricated via hot pressing 
(Chetty et al. 2019). Microcracks formed at the interface between 
Cu26Nb2Ge6S32 and Ti or Pt due to a mismatch in their coefficients of 
thermal expansion, resulting in increased interface resistance and lower 
conversion efficiency. Cu26Nb2Ge6S32 (Chetty et al. 2019), Ti (Touloukian  
et al. 1975) and Pt (Touloukian et al. 1975) have thermal expansions of 
~16.9 × 10−6 K−1, ~10.4×10−6 K−1 and ~9.8 × 10−6 K−1, respectively, at 573 K. 
Because the coefficients of thermal expansion between Cu26Nb2Ge6S32 and 
the Ni or Au contact layers were close (Ni: ~15.9 × 10−6 K−1 at 573 K 
(Touloukian et al. 1975), Au: ~16.9 × 10−6 K−1 at 573 K (Touloukian et al. 
1975)), no cracks occurred at the interface. However, in the case of the Ni  
 
 

108     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
contact layer, secondary phases were formed around the interface, resulting 
in high interface resistance and reduced conversion efficiency. In the case of 
the Au contact layer, no secondary phases were found around the interface, 
allowing a reduced specific contact resistance of 4 × 10−10 to 5 × 10−10 Ω m. 
Table 4.5 summarizes the power generation characteristics of the 
Cu26Nb2Ge6S32-based elements. For temperature differences of 270 K, the 
maximum thermoelectric conversion efficiency ηmax was estimated to be 
~3.3% in the Cu26Nb2Ge6S32-based thermoelectric element with the  
Au-based contact layer. The prototype Cu26Cr2Ge6S32-based thermoelectric 
power generation module was developed alongside n-type Pb0.98Ga0.02Te-3% 
GeTe (Chetty et al. 2022). When the hot- and cold-side temperature were 
maintained at 673 and 283 K, respectively, ηmax of ~5.5% was obtained for 
the Cu26Cr2Ge6S32/Pb0.98Ga0.02Te-3% GeTe module.

whereas the hot-side temperature (Th) was varied from 370 to 570 K (Chetty  
et al. 2019) 
4.3.2. Cu and Ag sulfide-based superionic conductors 
The effects of mobile Cu ions must be considered when fabricating 
thermoelectric modules with Cu2S (or more generally with the superionic 
mixed ionic–electronic conductors) (Qiu et al. 2018, 2019). The  
diffusivity of mobile ions (Cu+ ions in Cu2S) is low due to its low activation 
energy, Ea (e.g. 0.19 eV in Cu2S) (Balapanov et al. 2004). Energetically, the 
neighboring atomic site is close, and ions can jump frequently to the 
neighboring sites. The charge carrier flows in a specific direction in response 
to an external driving force, such as an electric field or temperature gradient. 
These phenomena can cause the deposition of Cu on the surface and the 
degradation of thermoelectric legs. 

Sulfide Thermoelectrics: Materials and Modules     109 
Cu metal deposited on the sample surface can damage the electrode 
contact by causing cracks or incoherent interfaces. These changes increase 
the electrical and thermal resistance at the interface and degrade the 
performance of the thermoelectric module (Dennler et al. 2014; Powell 
2019). In addition, Cu movement towards the cathode may result in the 
evaporation of chalcogen at the anode. In a similar Cu2Se-based material, 
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory stopped the development of radioisotope 
thermal generators for space applications in 1979, after more than 10 years 
of research due to these instabilities. Therefore, this degradation behavior 
must be addressed before employing in any applications (Brown et al. 2013; 
Dennler et al. 2014). Several trials have been proposed to address these 
problems, including the use of ion blocking; however, electronically 
conductive interfaces realize a high total voltage with large current densities 
(Qiu et al. 2018, 2019). Based on the thermodynamic explanation, critical 
voltage rather than current density is the deciding factor for Cu deposition. 
Therefore, a thermoelectric leg segmented by ion blocking layers can 
prevent Cu migration and improve stability. This study shows that if the 
leg’s chemical potential or segmented portion is selected to be lower than the 
corresponding critical voltage (chemical potential), Cu-based compounds 
(and other superionic mixed ionic–electronic conductors) can effectively 
provide larger current densities and have high-performance with stability. 
Ag migration in Ag-based chalcogenides has not been studied in terms of 
module development, unlike Cu2(S, Se). However, the few reports on their 
power generating characteristics are promising. It has been recently shown 
that Ag2S-based compounds can be directly cut into flexible thin foils from 
bulk samples, allowing for the development of flexible thermoelectric 
generators for wearables without the support of substrates (Liang et al. 
2019). This is due to their unique flexibility and metallic plastic 
deformability (Shi et al. 2018). A six-couple flexible device with a lateral  
Π-shaped configuration using Ag2S0.5Se0.5 foils (n-type legs) was fabricated, 
in which Pt–Rh wires were used to connect the top and bottom ends of the 
thermoelectric legs in series. This module generated a power output of  
~10 µW at temperature difference of 20 K (cold-side temperature of 293 K) 
(Liang et al. 2019). In another study, a cylindrical hetero-shaped 
thermoelectric module using strips of Ag20S7Te3, which is also a superionic 
conductor with excellent shape-conformability, was fabricated (Yang et al. 
2021). A power output of ~17.1 µW was achieved under temperature 
difference of 70 K.

4.4. Summary and prospects 
This chapter has addressed the recent progress in selected thermoelectric 
sulfides and their modules. The high thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, in 
sulfide materials was enhanced using novel strategies, including carrier 
concentration tuning, electronic band engineering, crystal structure evolution 
and phonon engineering. Advanced sulfide research has progressed from 
materials development to module fabrication. In addition, power generation 
in sulfide-based modules has been demonstrated. For further progress and 
social implementation of sulfide thermoelectrics, more effort and progress 
should be devoted to improving the module performance, stability, 
mechanical strength and system assembly for the social implementation of 
sulfide thermoelectrics.

Strongly Correlated Oxides

5.1. Introduction to electron correlation 
Let us start from what differentiates between metals and insulators. This 
has been a central issue in solid state physics. At the beginning of the  
20th century, we knew that salt and copper formed a crystal, i.e. a substance 
made from periodic arrangement of a vast number of atoms, but did not 
understand why salt was insulating and why copper was conductive. Now, 
we understand this on the basis of the band theory, as explained in all the 
introductory textbooks for solid state physics (Kittel et al. 1996). 
We should note here that the band theory is based on the so-called  
one-electron approximation and does not properly take the electron–electron 
interaction into account. The conduction electrons are negatively charged, 
and they tend to keep away from one another as far as possible in a 
correlated manner in order to minimize the repulsive Coulomb interaction. If 
this correlation is strong enough, such metals begin to show insulating 
behavior, and predictions from the band theory are broken down. Such 
systems are called strongly correlated electron systems, which many

transition-metal oxides belong to (Dagotto 2005). A prime example is the 
high-temperature superconducting copper oxides (Lee et al. 2006b), in which 
no band calculations have predicted superconductivity before. 
 
Figure 5.1. Schematic of chemical potential plotted as a function of carrier 
concentration per site. The dotted line is a simplified curve for an uncorrelated 
(weakly correlated) electron system, while the solid curve corresponds to a strongly 
correlated electron system. We assume that the electronic states adiabatically transit 
from weakly correlated to strongly correlated ones 
We intuitively explain how the electron correlation modifies the 
electronic states. Figure 5.1 schematically shows the chemical potential μ 
plotted as a function of carrier concentration. Here, we suppose a simple 
solid which includes only one element responsible for the electrical 
conduction per unit cell, and we also assume no degeneracy in the valence 
band. In such cases, the carrier concentration can be expressed in terms of 
carrier number per site (n). When n = 0, the valence band is empty, and thus 
the system is insulating. When n = 2, the valence band is completely filled 
by the electrons with up and down spins, and there is a finite energy gap to 
the next valence band (also called the conduction band). The system is thus 
again insulating, which explains why solid helium is a tough insulator. 
An interesting case is in n = 1, where the valence band is half-filled, and 
one electron stays in average at each site. In this situation, the electron 
correlation is most enhanced, and the system can be easily insulating when 
the electron correlations are sufficiently strong. As shown in Figure 5.1, by 
adiabatically increasing the strength of electron correlation, an energy gap  
opens at n = 1, which is referred to as the “Mott gap” (Imada et al. 1998). 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     127 
 
This situation is well captured in the Hubbard Hamiltonian expressed by 
𝐻= 𝑡∑
𝑐௜ఙ
ற𝑐௝ఙ + 𝑈∑𝑛௜↑𝑛௜↓
௜
௜,௝,ఙ
, 
[5.1] 
where 𝑐௜ఙ
ற and 𝑐௜ఙ are, respectively, the creation and annihilation operators of 
an electron with spin 𝜎 (= ↑ or ↓) at the site i. 𝑛௜ఙ= 𝑐௜ఙ
ற𝑐௜ఙ is the number 
operator at the site i, and takes the eigenvalue of 0 or 1 reflecting the Pauli 
principle. The first term represents the transfer energy from the site j to i, 
describing the energy band with a width proportional to t, while the second 
term represents the strength of the Coulomb repulsion U at the site i, 
meaning that two electrons with opposite spin sitting at the same site 
increase the total energy by U. 
 
Figure 5.2. Schematic electronic states for the half-filling  
(n = 1) as a function of U/t (Fujimori et al. 2001) 
Although the second term is a brave simplification of the Coulomb 
repulsion in the sense that the long-range potential of |𝑙𝑟−𝑙𝑟′|−1 is 
approximated as the impulsive force of 𝛿൫𝑙𝑟−𝑙𝑟′൯, the Hubbard 
Hamiltonian captures essential features of the strong correlation. Figure 5.2 
schematically shows how the electronic states for n = 1 are modified as a 
function of U/t (Fujimori et al. 2001). At the bottom of the figure, a weakly 
correlated case is drawn, where the density of states (DOS) is half-filled  
 
 

128     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
with the chemical potential in the center of DOS. This is a typical picture of 
a metal, and the physical properties are determined by the electrons near the 
chemical potential (i.e. the Fermi energy). At the top of the figure, on the 
other hand, the large limit of U/t causes the Mott gap of U, and the lower 
(upper) Hubbard band is completely filled (empty). This is a typical picture 
of an insulator except for the nature of the Hubbard band; the lower (upper) 
Hubbard band accepts only one electron per site, whereas the conventional 
band accepts two. Thus, the Hubbard band is produced by many-body 
effects, and each one-electron state in the band cannot be expressed 
analytically. 
In the intermediate state of U/t, the electronic states depend on 
approximation. Figure 5.2 shows three typical examples. As shown in the 
right of the figure, Hubbard treated the second term in equation [5.1] within 
a framework of mean-field approximation. The upper and lower Hubbard 
bands overlap, and the center of gravity for each DOS is separated by U. 
With increasing U, the two bands continuously separate to create the Mott 
gap. Brinkman and Rice treated the electron correlation through the 
Gutzwiller projection method, where the double occupancy at the same site 
is excluded by the projection operator P = Π௜ሺ1 −𝑛௜↑𝑛௜↓ሻ. In this technique, 
the electrons move coherently in order to avoid the double occupancy at the 
same site, and eventually the effective mass is enhanced by the coherent 
motion, as shown in the left of the figure. In this situation, the bandwidth 
gets narrower with increasing U/t, and the effective mass enhanced by U 
finally diverges to become an insulator, but it is difficult to create the Mott 
gap. Recently, dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) was developed, where 
the effect of U can be exactly taken into the self-energy of one-electron state 
in the infinite dimensions. The DMFT calculation gives the one-electron 
electronic state, as shown in the center of the figure, where the Brinkman–
Rice-like coherent peak at μ has a Hubbard-band-like incoherent peak at 
±U/2 from μ. In this picture, the mass enhancement and the gap growth 
simultaneously occur. 
We have investigated why and how the electron correlation improves the 
thermoelectric performance in some transition-metal oxides. As shown in 
Figure 5.1, the chemical potential becomes flat near the Mott gap, implying a 
macroscopic number of degeneracy near the gap (i.e. dn/dμ → ∞) and a 
large entropy per site. In terms of the Hubbard band, the lower Hubbard 
band is filled, but still has spin degrees of freedom at each site; one electron 
stays at each site, but its spin orientation is undetermined either up or down. 
Peterson and Shastry (2010) have proposed that the Kelvin formula well 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     129 
 
describes the thermopower of strongly correlated materials. The Kelvin 
formula is given by 
𝑆୏= −1
𝑒൬𝜕𝜇
𝜕𝑇൰
ே,௏
, 
[5.2] 
where N is the electron number, and V is the volume. The Gibbs–Duhem 
equation gives 
−𝜕𝜇
𝜕𝑇= ൬Σ
𝑁൰
ே,௉
 
[5.3] 
where Σ is the entropy and P is the pressure. In solids far below the  
melting point, the constant-volume condition can be identified with the  
constant-pressure condition. Then, we arrive at eSK = Σ/N, meaning that  
the entropy per electron determines the thermopower. Accordingly, S can be 
enhanced by the large entropy/degeneracy near n = 1 in strongly correlated 
electron systems. Here, we review the thermoelectric properties of  
transition-metal oxides, and explain the contribution of the strongly 
correlated electrons. 
5.2. Electronic states of transition-metal oxides  
Let us introduce possible energy levels of d orbitals of the Mn+ ion 
surrounded by the six oxygen anions, as schematically drawn in  
Figure 5.3(a). When the Cartesian coordinate is taken as the directions to the 
oxygen ions, the fivefold degenerate d levels in vacuum split into doubly 
degenerate eg level and triply degenerate t2g level, as shown in Figure 5.3(b). 
This is due to the electrostatic Coulomb repulsion from the oxygen anions; 
the d orbitals extending away from the oxygen anions belong to the lower t2g 
level, while the d orbitals pointing to the oxygen anions belong to the higher 
eg level. 
This electrostatic potential referred to as the ligand field competes with 
Hund’s rule. Figure 5.3(c) shows how the d electrons occupy the energy 
levels. When the number of d electrons is from one to three (d1, d2, d3), they 
occupy the t2g levels with parallel spin configuration in order to satisfy 
Hund’s rule. Similarly, when the number of d electrons is from eight to nine 
(d8, d9), holes occupy the eg level with parallel spin configuration, instead of 
electrons.

Figure 5.3. (a) Transition-metal ion Mn+ octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen 
anions. (b) The fivefold degenerate d orbitals and the energy levels of t2g and  
eg by the ligand field. (c) The spin state configuration for dn electrons 
For the number of d electrons from four to seven (d4, d5, d6, d7), two 
different configurations are possible. When the ligand field is dominant, the 
d electrons occupy the lower t2g level first. In contrast, when Hund’s rule is 
dominant, the d electrons occupy t2g and eg levels in order to maximize the 
total spin number. The former is called the low-spin state, while the latter is 
called the high-spin state (Sugano et al. 1970). 
5.3. 3D transition-metal oxides  
The perovskite-type structure is widely seen in ternary transition-metal 
oxides, where the A cation forms a simple cubic lattice, the oxygen anion sits 
at the face-center site and the B cation occupies the body-center position, as 
schematically drawn in Figure 5.4(a). The A site usually accommodates 
large-size cations such as alkaline earth elements (Ca, Sr, Ba) and rare-earth 
element (Y, La, Ce, Pr, …, Lu). In contrast, the B site usually accommodates 
small-sized cations such as transition metals (Ramadass 1978). Mostly, the A 
site controls the lattice volume and the formal valence of the B site, whereas 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     131 
 
the B site and the BO6 octahedron determine the conductivity and 
magnetism. 
Figure 5.4(b) schematically shows a phase diagram of transition-metal 
oxides with the perovskite structure ABO3 (based on Fujimori (1992)). The 
horizontal axis schematically represents U/t. We can see that the vertical 
lines of d0 (e.g. SrTiO3) and d1 (e.g. LaTiO3) correspond to the band 
insulator and Mott insulator, respectively. The area between d0 and d1 
corresponds to solid solutions. For example, only x ∼ 1 makes the system 
insulating for Sr1−xLaxTiO3 (Tokura et al. 1993), while all the samples are 
insulating in Ca1−xYxTiO3 (Kumagai et al. 1993). The vertical line of dn  
(n ≥ 4) is named the “charge-transfer insulator” (Zaanen et al. 1985), which 
can be broadly interpreted as the “Mott insulator”. The insulating area 
extends to lower near the vertical lines of dn (n ≥ 1), and conversely the 
metallic area mostly extends to upper near dn−1/2 (quarter filling). Of course, 
the conductivity strongly depends on the species of the B-site cation; Cr, Mn 
and Fe oxides are mostly insulating, whereas Ti, Co, Ni and Cu oxides often 
become conductive by doping carriers (Imada et al. 1998).

5.3.1. Co oxides 
Terasaki et al. (1997) discovered good thermoelectric properties in a 
single-crystal sample of NaCo2O4 (now known as NaxCoO2). This material 
showed a low resistivity of 200 μΩcm with a large thermopower of  
100 μV/K at 300 K. Later, Fujita et al. (2001) measured high-temperature 

132     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
thermoelectric properties of their single-crystal samples, and found that the 
dimensionless figure of merit zT exceeded unity above 800 K. Since then, 
many related cobalt oxides have been synthesized and identified (Funahashi 
et al. 2000; Itoh and Terasaki 2000; Masset et al. 2000; Miyazaki et al. 2000; 
Maignan et al. 2002b; Pelloquin et al. 2002; Ishiwata et al. 2006; Kobayashi 
and Terasaki 2006; Yamauchi et al. 2011), some of which are found to be as 
good as NaxCoO2 (Funahashi and Shikano 2002; Shikano and Funahashi 
2003). The record data are collected in Figure 5.5(a) (Prasad and Bhame 
2020). Most data are concentrated in the cobalt oxides before 2010, where 
the single crystals show zT >0.9 and even polycrystalline samples show  
zT ∼ 0.8. Before the discovery of the layered cobalt oxide, oxides were not 
that competitive; people believed that the oxides were electrically poor but 
thermally good conductors. The appearance of the cobalt oxides has 
overturned the consensus in the community (Karppinen et al. 2002; Maignan 
et al. 2002a, 2002b; Koumoto et al. 2006; Hébert et al. 2007; Koumoto et al. 
2013). After 2010, BiCuSeO-base compounds continued to update the 
record, which will be discussed in the next section. 
The crystal structures of the layered cobalt oxides are schematically 
shown in Figure 5.5(b). The CdI2-type CoO2 layer consisting of edge-shared 
CoO2 octahedra is responsible for the large power factor, and the block layer 
located between the CoO2 layers stabilizes the structure electrostatically, and 
dominates the phonon thermal conductivity. The layered structure works 
quite well in two ways. One way is that the electric current and thermal 
current flow in different paths in space, as shown in the right panel of  
Figure 5.5(b) (Tada et al. 2010). This enables us to control the lattice thermal 
conductivity by properly choosing the insulating block layer (Satake et al. 
2004; Takashima et al. 2021). This is a manifestation of electron-crystal and 
phonon-glass (Slack 1995; Takabatake et al. 2014). 
The other way is that the CdI2-type CoO2 block enhances the power 
factor. Koshibae et al. (2000) extended the Heikes formula (Chaikin and 
Beni 1976) in order to include the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, and 
found the formula given by

where gA and gB are the degeneracies of the A and B ions, respectively, and x 
is the content of the A ions. As schematically drawn in Figure 5.3(c), the six  
 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     133 
 
electrons in the low-spin Co3+ ion (d6) fully occupy the t2g levels, so that 
degeneracy is unity. In contrast, in the low-spin Co4+ ion (d5), one electron is 
removed out of the six electrons, and thus six states are degenerate (a spin 
degeneracy of two and an orbital degeneracy of three). Substituting gA = 6 
and gB = 1 in equation [5.4], we evaluate the thermopower to be  
kB log 6/e = 150 μV/K in addition to the x-dependent term. This log gA/gB 
corresponds to a large entropy per electron, enhancing the thermopower 
through equations [5.2] and [5.3]. 
The relationship of the spin state of the Co3+ ions to the thermopower has 
been experimentally verified in the room-temperature ferromagnet 
Sr3YCo4O10.5 (Kobayashi et al. 2005; Ishiwata et al. 2007; Nakao et al. 
2011), where the spin state is easily controlled by pressure and a magnetic 
field (Matsunaga et al. 2010). Takahashi et al. (2018) found that the pressure 
changes the magnetization and thermopower in a consistent way. Such spin 
and orbital degrees of freedom are absent in conventional thermoelectric 
materials, indicating the reason why the cobalt oxides possess 
extraordinarily high thermoelectric performance among oxides. 
This large entropy is evidenced by the specific heat measurement (Ando 
et al. 1999), and low-temperature thermopower (Wang et al. 2003; Lee et al. 
2006a). Terasaki (2001, 2003) compared the thermodynamic properties of 
NaxCoO2 with those of heavy fermion intermetallics, in the sense that the 
spin/orbital degrees of freedom attach the conduction electrons. Behnia et al. 
(2004) proposed that the temperature-linear thermopower can be associated 
with the electron specific heat, and the origin of the large thermopower is 
interrelated between the cobalt oxides and the heavy fermion compounds. 
The Heikes-formula-based argument neglects the itinerancy of the 
conduction electron. Koshibae and Maekawa (2001, 2003) theoretically 
studied the metallic conduction in the multiband Hubbard model, and 
discussed the relationship to the large thermopower. As thermoelectric 
materials, the layered cobalt oxides show good electrical conduction, and the 
band-picture should work well. At an early stage of the thermoelectric study 
in NaxCoO2, Singh (2000) already pointed out that the thermopower and 
specific heat of NaxCoO2 can be quantitatively understood from band 
calculation, and has suggested an importance of quantum fluctuation for 
good electrical conduction (Singh 2003). Kuroki and Arita (2007) suggested  
 
 
 

134     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
that a peculiar shape of the conduction band called the “pudding mold” can 
enhance the thermopower. Peterson and Shastry (2010) have shown by using 
the Kelvin formula that the hexagonal-lattice Hubbard model explains the 
thermopower of NaxCoO2 well.

5.3.2. Cu oxides 
Although high-temperature superconducting cuprates (HTSC) are a 
prototypical example for strongly correlated oxides, they do not exhibit 
thermoelectric performance as good as other thermoelectric materials. This 
is partially because the electron configuration of copper in HTSC is close to 
d9, in which the spin degrees of freedom are minimum (S = 1/2) with no 
orbital degrees of freedom. Thus, according to equation [5.4], large 
thermopower cannot be expected. 
The thermopower and resistivity of heavily underdoped HTSC are nearly 
the same values as those of the thermoelectric cobalt oxides below room 
temperature (Horiuchi et al. 2010). However, the thermopower of the layered 
cobalt oxides continues to increase up to 1000 K, while the thermopower of 
heavily underdoped HTSC decreases with temperature (Takeda et al. 1994). 
The two-dimensional square lattice of the CuO2 plane in HTSC is a bipartite 
with an electron–hole symmetry in the lowest order. As a result, the 
electron- and hole-like carriers are thermally excited equally to cancel the 
thermopower. In contrast, the triangular lattice in the CoO2 plane has no 
such electron–hole symmetry, and a large thermopower persists at high 
temperatures. This remains valid in the presence of strong correlation, as 
pointed out by Merino and Mckenzie (2000). We evaluate the power factor 
of HTSC to be no more than 15 μW/cmK2 (Horiuchi et al. 2010). Using the 
thermal conductivity of 50 mW/cmK, we evaluate zT to be 0.09 at maximum 
at 300 K. This evaluation is consistent with the early survey of Macklin and 
Moseley (1990), and indeed most of the literature data do not exceed this 
value (Liu et al. 2009). 
At the end of this section, we will briefly introduce the copper 
oxyselenide BiCuSeO that was recently discovered as a thermoelectric 
material (Zhao et al. 2014). This class of materials (LaAgSO) was originally 
synthesized by Palazzi et al. (1980), and later Kamihara et al. (2006, 2008) 
discovered high-temperature superconductors now known as the “1111” 
phase. A possibility of thermoelectric material was first suggested by Zhao 
et al. (2010), where the 15-% Sr substitution improved zT up to 0.76 at  
873 K. 
This material is also a layered material in which the Bi2O2 layer and the 
Cu2Se2 layer alternately stack along the c axis. According to the band 
calculation, this material is a multiband semiconductor, whose valence bands 
consist of hybridized Cu 3D-Se4p and non-bonding Cu 3D. In the sense of 

136     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
electronic states, this material does not belong to Cu oxide, but is often 
introduced as a part of oxide thermoelectric materials. The electrons in this 
material are unlikely to be strongly correlated. Carrier doping is well 
described by the rigid-band picture, and the details of the Fermi surface are 
consistent between theory and experiment (Ren et al. 2019). As a 
thermoelectric material, the most advantageous feature is the low thermal 
conductivity coming from van-der-Waals bonding between the layers. More 
details can be seen in (Zhao et al. 2014) and the references therein. 
5.3.3. Other 3D transition-metal oxides 
We briefly mention other transition-metal oxides. The perovskite titanate 
SrTiO3 has been extensively investigated as an n-type thermoelectric 
material. A small amount of Nb substitution for Ti or La substitution for Sr 
makes a large power factor arising from heavy effective mass (Okuda et al. 
2001; Ohta et al. 2005). Ohta et al. (2007) found extraordinarily large 
thermopower in SrTiO3/Sr(Ti,Nb)O3 superlattices, and proposed that the 
two-dimensional electron gas enhances the thermoelectric performance. This 
material basically belongs to a conventional degenerate semiconductor, and 
not to correlated oxides. The Mott insulator LaTiO3 is not a good 
thermoelectric material. Pálsson and Kotliar (1998) have pointed out that a 
simple Mott transition in the titanium oxide cannot improve thermoelectric 
properties. ZnO has been studied as an n-type thermoelectric material 
(Ohtaki et al. 1996), and shows a reasonably large zT ∼ 04–0.6 at high 
temperatures (see Figure 5.5(a)). This is a conventional high-mobility 
semiconductor, 
where 
the 
electron 
correlation 
is 
weak. 
In 
the 
semiconducting manganese oxide CaMnO3, the Mn ion has the electron 
configuration d3, which filled t2g levels with up spin. This situation 
practically works as a semiconductor with the energy gap between t2g and eg, 
where an electron is doped by the partial substitution of Nb for Mn (Thiel  
et al. 2015). 
5.4. 4D transition-metal oxides 
As is well known, the 3D orbital is localized in space, which often makes 
an insulating ground state. Since the orbital becomes broader in going from 
3D to 5D, the 4D or 5D transition-metal oxides are more likely to be 
conductive. In particular, the 4D transition-metal oxide still has strong 
electron correlation, in which highly correlated metallic states are expected. 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     137 
 
5.4.1. Rh oxides 
Rhodium is located below cobalt in the periodic table, and thus is 
expected to have similar chemical properties. In fact, many cobalt oxides 
have their isomorphic rhodium oxides, and similar transport properties are 
reported in such layered rhodium oxides such as SrxRh2O4 (Okamoto et al. 
2006), Bi-Ba/Sr-Rh-O (Okada and Terasaki 2005; Okada et al. 2005; Klein 
et al. 2006b; Kobayashi et al. 2007), KxRhO2 (Shibasaki et al. 2010; Okazaki 
et al. 2011) and CuRhO2 (Shibasaki et al. 2006; Maignan et al. 2009). An 
important difference from the Co3+ ions is that the Rh3+ ions are stable in the 
low-spin state at all the temperatures of interest. This is advantageous to 
large thermopower based on equation [5.4]. The thermopower of 
La1−xSrxRhO3 (Ref (Terasaki et al. 2010)) makes a remarkable contrast to 
that of La1−xSrxCoO3 (Ref (Androulakis et al. 2004; Iwasaki et al. 2008)). 
The thermopower of La1−xSrxRhO3 continues to increase up to 800 K for all 
x, and remains larger than 150 μV/K at 800 K, as already discussed with 
equation [5.4], whereas the thermopower of La1−xSrxCoO3 rapidly decreases 
down to a few μV/K above 500 K due to the spin-state crossover (Iwasaki et 
al. 2008). Usui et al. (2009) have calculated the large thermopower in 
LaRhO3 and CuRhO2. 
An intriguing question lies in the solid solution of cobalt and rhodium 
oxides. Figure 5.6(a) shows the resistivity of the perovskite oxide 
La0.8Sr0.2Co1−xRhxO3 (Shibasaki et al. 2011). The 20-% Sr substitution 
supplies sufficiently high carrier concentration in this system, making the 
samples metallic at room temperature. For x = 0, the hole in the Co4+ ion 
shows good conduction through the double exchange mechanism to the Co3+ 
ion in the intermediate spin state of 𝑡ଶ௚
ହ𝑒௚ଵ. With increasing x, the Co3+ ions 
tend to stay at the low-spin state, and the resistivity systematically increases. 
The x = 1 sample shows almost temperature-independent resistivity. With 
decreasing temperature, the samples for 0 < x < 1 show an upturn, and the 
holes are likely localized at low temperatures. 
More interesting behavior is seen in the thermopower shown in  
Figure 5.6(b). The x = 0 sample shows small but metallic thermopower, 
which can be understood by applying equation [5.4] to the Co3+ ions in the 
intermediate-spin state. In contrast, in the x = 1 sample, the thermopower is 
as large as 80 μV/K at room temperature, and decreases almost linearly with 
decreasing temperature. This resembles the thermopower of NaxCoO2, 
implying the Rh3+ ions in the low-spin state. All the samples for 0 < x < 1 
show larger thermopower than x = 0 and 1, meaning that the thermopower 

138     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
cannot be understood by the average of x = 0 and 1. We have proposed that 
the spin-state disorder carries additional entropy to enhance the 
thermopower. We also suggest that this spin-state disorder is responsible for 
the non-metallic resistivity at low temperatures. 
 
Figure 5.6. (a) Resistivity and (b) thermopower  
of La0.8Sr0.2Co1−xRhxO3 (Shibasaki et al. 2011) 
Solid solutions of cobalt and rhodium oxides affect the spin states of 
Co3+. Asai et al. (2011) found a weakly ferromagnetic state in 
LaCo1−xRhxO3, below 20 K, and suggested that the substituted Rh ions allow 
the neighboring Co3+ ions to be in the high-spin state. This speculation was 
checked by lattice expansion (Asai et al. 2013), infrared spectroscopy 
(Terasaki et al. 2017) and X-ray absorption (Sudayama et al. 2017). 
Theoretically, Knížek et al. (2012) have proposed that the substituted 

A Concise Review of Strongly Correlated Oxides     139 
 
rhodium ion elastically and electrostatically stabilizes the neighboring cobalt 
ions in the high-spin state. 
5.4.2. Ru oxides 
A cubic perovskite ruthenate SrRuO3 is an itinerant ferromagnet below 
160 K, known as a bad metal whose resistivity continues to increase at high 
temperature due to strong correlation beyond the Ioffe–Regel limit (the mean 
free path cannot be shorter than the lattice parameters) (Klein et al. 1996). 
Klein et al. (2006a) found that the thermopower (∼ 35 μV/K at 300 K) of 
SrRuO3 is insensitive to impurity doping, and discussed this in terms of the 
modified Heikes formula of equation [5.4]. Hébert et al. (2015) extensively 
studied cubic perovskite-related ruthenates. Yamamoto et al. (2017) have 
shown that the field-dependent part of the thermopower obeys the Kelvin 
formula in the weakly ferromagnetic CaRu0.8Sc0.2O3. 
A layered perovskite ruthenate Ca2RuO4 crystallizes in the K2NiF4-type 
structure, where the conductive RuO2 planes consisting of the corner-shared 
RuO6 octahedra are stacked with the CaO double layer along the c axis. 
Nakatsuji et al. (1997) first synthesized this oxide, and later Alexander et al. 
(1999) found a first-order metal–insulator transition at approximately 360 K. 
We have studied the nonlinear conduction in Ca2RuO4 (Okazaki et al. 2013, 
2014, 2020; Nishina et al. 2017; Tanabe et al. 2017), since Nakamura et al. 
(2013) discovered a giant nonlinear conduction a room temperature. Okazaki 
et al. (2013) established a measurement technique of nonlinear conduction 
using an infrared thermometer, and successfully separated the intrinsic 
nonlinear conduction from self-heating. Nishina et al. (2017) observed the 
Seebeck coefficient enhanced by a constant current flow. Very recently, 
Kawasaki et al. (2021) found that the in-plane thermal diffusivity of 
Ca2RuO4 decreases by 40% for a current density of 14 A/cm2. 
5.5. Concluding remarks 
We have reviewed the current status of the thermoelectric properties of 
strongly correlated transition-metal oxides. Although they are mostly poor 
electric conductors, the dimensionless figure of merit is found to be close to 
unity at high temperatures. Taking the advantages in oxide materials 
(chemical stability at high temperatures, low mass density, easy 
processability, etc.) into account, Terasaki (2011) proposes some oxide 

140     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
materials as a good candidate for high-temperature thermoelectrics, as he 
previously pointed out that oxides are advantageous to the high-temperature 
thermoelectrics from the viewpoint of solid state physics of disordered 
materials.

6.1. Introduction 
In the upcoming society, various sensing technologies are installed in our 
living space, and they are connected by wireless communication 
technologies, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). The physical data 
carried by the communication network will be processed by artificial 
intelligence (AI) in cyberspace to add values to daily lives. Due to the huge 
number of sensors required, the exchange of batteries in, and wiring 
connection to, every sensor are not realistic, resulting in the expectation of 
energy harvesting technology. This chapter starts with the consideration of

requirements for wireless power supply, using ambient waste heat. 
Thermoelectric (TE) conversion is a long-known technology for the 
interconversion of heat (temperature difference) and electrical energy. The 
power generation efficiency of TE power generation is the product of the 
Carnot efficiency and the dimensionless figure of merit, zT (z = σS2 /κ, σ: 
electrical conductivity (S m-1), S: Seebeck coefficient (V K-1), κ: thermal 
conductivity (W m -1K-1), T: absolute temperature (K)), where the higher the zT, 
the higher the power generation efficiency. The higher the zT, the higher the 
power generation efficiency. When a relatively large temperature difference of 
several hundred degrees Celsius is assumed (e.g. in furnaces and vehicles), good 
Carnot efficiency can be obtained, where thermoelectrics can be considered as a 
method to obtain renewable energy. This technology can potentially generate 
enough electric power to independently drive small electronic devices such as 
sensors and communications. There are many cases and infrastructures in our 
daily lives where we would like to set countless sensors in places where it is 
difficult to wire them to a public power supply or even to install solar cells.  
In this sense, energy harvesters including TE power generators are considered to 
be a powerful tool for realizing IoT society in near future.  
Many high-efficiency TE inorganic materials and devices are available in 
the high-temperature range. On the other hand, the target of this chapter is to 
obtain microwatt-level power from temperature differences of a few to several 
tens of degrees Celsius in the environment, where thermal impedance matching 
between heat sources and TE generators is more and more important. TE 
generators are, in this context, required to closely attach to heat sources with a 
non-flat surface including pipes and human bodies. To address this issue, 
flexible TE modules are proposed in terms of two major directions (Bahk et al. 
2015; Nan et al. 2018). Firstly, flexible substrates with movable electrodes are 
used for developing bendable TE modules. Another way for the same purpose 
is the use of flexible semiconductors and conductors including conducting 
polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this chapter, we would like to 
introduce the recent progress in thermoelectric generators (TEGs) based on 
CNTs along with their basic studies on transport properties and carrier doping.  
6.2. Carbon nanotubes 
The driving temperature of TE materials is roughly correlated with the 
band gap, and it is known that bismuth telluride shows high TE efficiency 
around room temperature. Since the 2010s, many researchers have started to 
recognize that there are potentially useful TE materials in the material 

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     151 
groups which are qualitatively different from the existing semiconductor and 
ceramics materials. The candidates include organic and nanocarbon 
materials such as conducting polymers and CNTs, where robust conjugated 
networks provide mechanically flexible, macroscopic architectures with 
designed electronic properties. Particularly, single-walled carbon nanotubes 
(SWCNTs) are light and structurally flexible even when formed into a 
relatively thick network film. From the viewpoint of electronic properties, 
they are one-dimensional semiconductors or metals made of carbon, and 
they transport electrons and heat efficiently. In the 1990s, it was pointed out 
that various physical properties such as the Seebeck effect can be controlled 
by nanostructuring (Hicks and Dresselhaus 1993). Due to the significant 
chemical and structural stability, in this context, SWCNTs are an 
intrinsically robust candidate for the investigation of low-dimensional 
thermoelectric transport, along with straightforward electronic and energy 
applications. Most of the commercially available CNTs are mixtures of 
semiconducting and metallic types depending on the helicity of graphite 
sheets. As far as the Seebeck coefficient is concerned, the mixture films are 
not much different from alloy metals such as constantan (30–50 μV K-1). 
They can be controlled to be either p-type or n-type using rational chemical 
treatments, and then TE modules with a so-called π-type structure can be 
constructed to generate a reasonable amount of power. 
6.3. Transport to materials studies 
CNTs are produced by different suppliers with completely different 
properties. The current TE figure of merit (zT) is assumed to be in the range 
of 10-3 to 10-4 although there is a large variation among suppliers. The first 
observation of Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric power, thermopower) in 
CNT mats was reported in 1998, by Zettl et al. (see Figure 6.1(a)) (Hone  
et al. 1998). Due to higher conductivity, the observed transport properties are 
considered to significantly reflect the nature of metallic CNT. The effects of 
environmental gases on the TE properties were then examined (see  
Figure 6.1(b)), where oxygen could induce p-type doping (Bradley et al. 
2000). Afterwards, advanced fabrication and MEMS (micro electro 
mechanical systems) enabled the thermoelectric and thermal properties of 
individual carbon nanotubes (see Figure 6.1(c) and (d)), deepening the 
understanding from a physics point of view. Kim et al. (Small et al. 2003) 
revealed that TE power and transconductance in individual SWCNTs were 
significantly modulated by gate electric field and observed large TE power

as high as ca. 260 μV K-1 at room temperature, derived from the Schottky 
barriers at SWCNT–metal junctions.

are wrapped around the emulsion particles (indicated by yellow dotted lines) rather 
than homogeneously mixed. Denser CNTs were observed for higher-concentration

In the early 2000s, due to low production ability and limited quality, 
SWCNTs were rarely recognized as TE materials for applications. The 
preparation of SWCNT films was empirically recognized to be difficult 
since SWCNTs at that time were too short to form spaghetti-like robust 
networks. In 2008, Yu et al. broke this limitation by preparing the 
composites of CNTs and emulsion particles (see Figure 6.2(a)) (Yu et al. 
2008). Base polymers served as the support of CNTs, affording better 
percolation networks penetrating whole films. With a CNT concentration of 
20 wt %, these composites exhibit an electrical conductivity of 4,800 S m-1, a 
thermal conductivity of 0.34 W (m·K)-1 and a TE figure of merit (ZT) 
greater than 0.006 at room temperature. This idea was spread as a  
 
 
 

154     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
breakthrough to the fabrication of various CNT-based composite materials 
around 2010. Chen et al. and Yu et al. have pioneered the CNT composites 
with conducting polymers such as polyaniline (Yao et al. 2010) and 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Kim 
et al. 2010) yielding practical TE power factors as high as several tens μW 
m−1 K−2 (see Figure 6.2(b)). State-of-the-art polymer composites made by 
layer-by-layer coating with high-quality dispersion was reported to exhibit a 
significant TE power factor: 1,825 μW m−1 K−2 for polyaniline (PANi) (Cho 
et al. 2015), graphene, and double-walled CNTs, and 2,710 μW m−1 K−2 for 
PANi/graphene-PEDOT:PSS/PANi/DWNT-PEDOT:PSS multilayers (Cho  
et al. 2016).  
In the 2010s, significant progress in SWCNTs production and 
commercialization has resulted in their direct use along with a significant 
improvement in TE properties. Furthermore, the consequent scale-up of 
structure-sorted SWCNTs (e.g. semiconducting and metallic) has explored a 
new class of TE materials. Maniwa et al. discovered the giant Seebeck 
coefficient in semiconducting SWCNT film in the range of 160 μV K-1 (see 
Figure 6.3(a)) (Nakai et al. 2014). An optimized power factor by acid doping 
reached 108 µW m−1 K−2. In the work, they used the semiconducting and 
metallic SWCNTs sorted by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Another 
sorting method such as conducting polymer wrapping also enabled the 
systematic investigation of TE transport in highly pure (ca. 99%) 
semiconducting SWCNT thin films. Ferguson et al. tracked the doping 
progress by TE properties along with optical absorption, leading to an  
in-depth understanding in terms of SWCNT’s one-dimensional electronic 
structures (Avery et al. 2016). Chemical doping systematically revealed the 
TE transport with an optimal power factor of approximately 340 µW m−1 K−2 
for the high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPco) CNT networks. 
Additionally, they discovered significant suppression in thermal conductivity 
upon chemical doping, from ~16.5 W m-1 K-1 down to 2–4.5 W m-1 K-1, 
leading to synergistic enhancement in zT. They further improved the TE 
properties by using supramolecular sorting agents that can be washed by acid 
treatment (see Figure 6.4) (MacLeod et al. 2017). The thin film of 
semiconducting SWCNTs over 99% purity with a trace of surfactants was 
reported to show a huge power factor as high as ca. 705 µW m−1 K−2 for the

plasma-torch source, and zT~0.12 for the HiPco material. These values are 
still smaller than those of optimized bismuth telluride (zT~0.6). However, it 
is a breakthrough to find a high level of TE properties in SWCNTs, which 
can be made in the scale of several tens of tons worldwide.

6.4. Chemical doping 
Among TE properties, Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and 
thermal conductivity are functions of carrier density or Fermi level. It has also 
been shown that there is a trade-off between these three factors in improving 
zT. Therefore, controlling the carrier density, or carrier doping, is important in 
designing TE materials. In addition, TE conversion modules with high 
efficiency have a so-called π-type structure, in which p-type and n-type 
materials are sandwiched between electrodes. This structure is superior to the 
monopolar structure in terms of heat utilization efficiency. For physical 
properties research, carrier doping has been performed by electrochemical 
doping, where TE measurements were performed in situ (Yanagi et al. 2014). 
On the other hand, for practical use, we need a doping method that can be 
applied stably and reproducibly on a stand-alone basis. In the following 
sections, the authors will introduce several approaches to practical doping. 
Doping in semiconductor engineering generally involves the introduction 
of ions of different valences. On the other hand, it is believed that 
nanocarbons can be implanted with carriers by substituting heteroatoms such 
as boron and nitrogen for carbon, but the mass production technology is still 

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     157 
in the research stage and there are many problems in controlling the 
substitution sites. Therefore, carrier injection using oxidants and reducing 
agents has been investigated.

The n-type doping of CNTs was initially confirmed by the addition of 
very intense reducing agents such as potassium metal, but potassium metal is 
extremely dangerous and unsuitable for realistic processes. Adsorption of 
poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) has also been used to n-type SWCNTs, but the 
doping effect seems to vanish after a few days of exposure to air. This 
degradation is more remarkable for semiconducting SWCNTs having a 
shallow conduction band than the mixture of semiconducting and metallic 
SWCNTs (Shim et al. 2001). This is probably due to the low stability of 
radical anion-type bonding in the graphene framework produced by electron 
doping, and the reaction of unstable sp3-like carbons with unshared electrons 

158     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
with electron uptakers such as oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water 
(H2O) under atmospheric conditions. 
In 2013, Nonoguchi et al. prepared the composite sheets of SWCNTs and 
the phosphine-based compounds represented in Figure 6.5 and discriminated 
the majority carriers by Seebeck coefficient (Nonoguchi et al. 2013).  
A positive value in the Seebeck coefficient indicates a p-type material, while a 
negative value indicates an n-type material. The undoped Seebeck coefficient 
was +49 μV K-1 at 310 K. After molecular doping, the Seebeck coefficient 
changed significantly from +90 μV K-1 to −80 μV K-1. In particular, the 
electron-donor-doped CNTs in Figure 6.5(c) showed a negative Seebeck 
coefficient, indicating the realization of stable n-type CNTs. In addition to 
amine-based molecules, a number of phosphine (phosphorus) derivatives were 
found to give relatively stable n-type CNTs. A clear correlation was found 
between the work function of the film and the electron-donatable level 
(HOMO) of the dopant compound, as measured by atmospheric photoelectron 
yield spectroscopy, strongly suggesting that intermolecular charge transfer 
following adsorption is the origin of the doping.

The phosphine-treated SWCNTs afforded 2.5-fold enhanced the TE 
power factor (ca. 25 μW m-1 K-2) compared to that of the PEI-treated 
SWCNTs, and zT increased by about five times. The n-type CNTs treated 
with triphenylphosphine were stable in air for about a month, but were 
sensitive to heat and humidity. It is important to note that the 
phosphine/phosphonium redox gave more stable n-type CNTs than the 
amine/ammonium redox. This means that CNT anions were stabilized by 
larger cations such as phosphonium.  
Considering the successful progress in the n-type SWCNTs’ stability 
above, it is likely that the introduction of larger molecular cations is 
beneficial for achieving more thermodynamic stability. In this context, 
Nonoguchi et al. developed a supramolecular system that enables the 
electron doping of SWCNTs and the in situ formation of appropriate 
molecular counterions for n-type SWCNTs (see Figure 6.6(a) and (b)) 
(Yoshiyuki et al. 2016). Typically, they used an alcoholic solution of crown 
ether and potassium hydroxide at around 10~100 mM. Crown ether is a 
typical supramolecular compound and is known to accommodate metal ions 
in its own pocket in high yields. After immersion and drying of CNT films in 
this solution, they found that stable n-type films were prepared under 
atmospheric conditions. As a control, we confirmed that stable n-type CNT 
films could not be obtained with crown ether and potassium hydroxide 
solutions alone. The present method produced relatively more stable n-type 
films than the conventional method (see Figure 6.6(c)). Through the 
optimization of the nanotube structure and dopant concentration, they 
achieved the preparation of films which did not show significant degradation 
for one month under accelerated test conditions of about 100°C in air (see 
Figure 6.6(d)). The optimized TE power factor exceeded 220 μW m-1 K-2, 
about 10 times larger than that reported in 2010–2013 due to the availability 
of high-quality nanotubes at that time and the dramatic improvement in film 
preparation technology including doping. 
In this reaction solution, the hydroxide ion is destabilized by being 
separated from the potassium ion due to the shielding effect of the crown 
ether (the naked anion effect). When the destabilized hydroxide ions act on 
the carbon nanotubes, the reduction reaction proceeds reproducibly, and 
electrons are injected into the nanotubes. The fact that this is not a 
degradation reaction but a doping of carbon nanotubes is confirmed by the 
modulation of interband absorption and plasmon resonance, the dramatic 
increase in conductivity and the positive and negative Seebeck coefficient 
reversals.

In addition, the complexes of potassium ion and crown ether are adsorbed 
around the negatively charged carbon nanotubes to satisfy the charge 
neutrality rule. It is known that the reduction reaction of potassium/ 
potassium ions does not produce stable n-type carbon nanotubes, and 
therefore the contribution of the crown ether complex to the stabilization is 
strongly suggested. The charges on the CNTs can be delocalized to the  
two-dimensional plane of the graphitic framework, and their stabilization by 
planer crown complex cations is consistent with the hard/soft acid–base 
(HSAB) rule. The structure dependence of the cations was investigated by 
electrochemical doping, confirming that macrocyclic crown ethers were 
effective (Nonoguchi et al. 2018). It was also found that large π-conjugated 
organic cations other than crown ethers also gave stable n-type films 
(Nonoguchi et al. 2017a, 2017b), and the same concept was successfully 
applied for a p-type counterpart (Nakano et al. 2017).  
Fujigaya et al. developed another way with organic reductants for the 
stabilization of n-type SWCNTs, expanding the design principle for n-type 
doping towards practical module fabrication (Nakashima et al. 2017). 
Particularly, they found that 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-
1H-benzo[d]imidazole (o-MeO–DMBI) offers air-stable n-type SWCNT 
sheets. The wet-chemically prepared material showed n-type TE properties 
over 90 days (see Figure 6.7(a) and (b)). In the n-type doping reaction,  
o-MeO–DMBI cations were detected as a side product by X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (see Figure 6.7(c) 
and (d)), suggesting the cations could compensate the negative charges 
injected in SWCNTs. Furthermore, they found unique stability dependence 
on dopant concentration, where the number of molecular dopant layers is 
crucial for obtaining effectively stable n-type SWCNT films (Nakashima  
et al. 2019). Adsorption isotherm measurements were applied to check the 
molecular layers, revealing that the entire coverage of the SWCNT surface 
by o-MeO–DMBI cation is the key requirement to realize the air stability. In 
a similar manner, various organic reductants including not only hydrogen 
atom or hydride transfer agents but also in situ generated radicals (Tanaka  
et al. 2021) are expected to serve for clean n-type doping of SWCNTs. Due 
to flexibility in the dopant design with organic reductants, the dopant 
introduction methods are not limited in the wet-chemical way such as casting 
and soaking but make it possible to use dry processes including vacuum 
deposition associated with the more precise control of doping positions and 
areas. Their development will pave the way for constructing design 
principles for arbitrary TE devices based on SWCNT power generation 
layers.

6.5. Thermoelectric generators using CNT 
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) using TE materials are attractive 
because they do not require moving parts and can generate electricity silently 
by using a temperature gradient. A TEG module is the π-shaped assembly of 
alternating p-type and n-type TE materials, which are connected electrically 
in series and thermally in parallel (Nan et al. 2018). An advantage of using 
CNTs for TEGs is their bendability, which imparts flexibility or even 
stretchability to the device. Therefore, a TEG module that can cover the 
surface of heat sources and take complete advantage of ubiquitous waste 
heat, such as body heat, has been the target of the CNT-based TEG. Recent 
studies revealed that the zT of CNT-based materials is still lower than 0.3 
(Blackburn et al. 2018); thus, a large integration of the p- and n-type CNT 
legs is vital to achieve considerable power generation. To increase power 
generation, many TEG structures have been developed based on CNT and 
CNT/polymer composites. These structures were designed based on those 
already developed for either inorganic or organic TEGs (Nandihalli et al. 
2020). However, CNTs possess unique one-dimensional (1D) structures and 
CNT-based materials often exhibit strong electrical and thermal conduction 
anisotropy based on their orientation. Thus, TEG design and preparation 
methods always require full consideration of their anisotropy. The electrical 
and thermal conductivities of CNT sheets in the in-plane direction are more 
than 100 times higher than those in the out-of-plane direction (Wei et al. 
2014). Although the structures of TEGs based on CNTs are similar to those 
of inorganic bulk materials or organic materials, their preparation methods 
are largely different. For example, in conventional inorganic bulk materials, 
TEG modules are fabricated by dicing the ingot, assembling the diced pieces 
on the substrate, and connecting it with an electrode. In comparison, for the 
CNT-based TEG module, CNT dispersion and CNT sheet preparation via 
filtration, doping and assembly into a p-n assembly were carried out. 
To produce sufficient power, p- and n-type TE materials need to be 
assembled in the TEG module to fully use the temperature gradient (ΔT) 
available from the environment. Typically, TEG modules composed of bulk 
materials such as Bi2Te3 are arranged such that the temperature difference 
between the two ends of the TE materials is perpendicular to the surface of 
the module. Conversely, because the CNT or CNT/polymer composites are 
typically thin films, the availability of the temperature difference in the  
out-of-plane direction is limited. Therefore, the three-dimensional (3D) 
structure of the TEG was investigated for CNTs. In the following sections, 
the developments of both 2D and 3D TEG structures are described.

6.6. TEG based on CNT sheet 
Because CNT sheets are prepared easily by vacuum filtration of the CNT 
dispersion and can be cut with scissors, the assembly of multiple CNT sheets 
with arbitrary sizes has been tested. In 2012, Yu et al. demonstrated a simple 
π-shape 2D TEG composed of PEI-doped (n-type) and undoped (p-type) 
single-walled SWCNT sheets (Figure 6.8(a)) (Yu et al. 2012). The three p–n 
couples exhibited a power of 25 nW at a ΔT = 22 K. In 2013, Nonoguchi  
et al. fabricated a bendable TEG module on a thin polyimide film using 
SWCNT sheets doped with triphenylphosphine and tetracyanoquinodimethane 
(TCNQ) as n- and p-type legs, respectively (Nonoguchi et al. 2013). The 
three p- and n-type legs were electrically connected in series using flexible 
copper tapes. The module generated a power of 110 nW at a ΔT of 20 K, 
which agreed with the values predicted by the Seebeck coefficients of both 
p- and n-type materials.

2,3,5,6,-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) and n-type 
CNT legs doped with benzyl viologen (BV) dichloride (An et al. 2017). 
Freestanding p-type and n-type CNT webs exhibiting high power factors of 
2,252 and 3,103 μW·m−1·K−2, respectively, were attached onto a flexible 
PET substrate and connected electrically in series using silver paste. A 
flexible TEG with 10 p–n couples generated 7.1 μW of power at a ΔT = 20 K, 
corresponding to an output per weight of 28.3 μW·g−1 and output per 
occupying area of 2.0 μW·cm−2 (Figure 6.8(b)). When the area was 

164     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
normalized to the leg cross-sectional area, a high power density of  
1,180 μW·cm−2 was obtained.  
A promising strategy to improve power density is to extend the structure 
in the vertical direction, instead of the lateral direction. Hewitt et al. (2012) 
and Kim et al. (2014) demonstrated 3D TEGs based on a multilayer stack of 
CNT sheets that used an in-plane temperature gradient. Kim et al. stacked 
non-doped CNT sheets (p-type) and n-type CNT sheets doped with PEI, 
diethylenetriamine and NaBH4 alternately in series with insulating films of 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inserted between them (see Figure 6.9). The 
TEG modules containing 72 p–n couples of the CNT films produced a power 
output of 1.8 µW at a ΔT= 32 K.

In the above π-shaped configurations, the p- and n-type legs are 
connected with conductive pastes or metal electrodes. However, these 
conductive pastes act as electrical resistances, thus lowering the output 
power of TE devices. Mytafides et al. pointed out that the contact resistance 
of the metals/SWCNT interface is higher than that of highly conductive 
SWCNTs and demonstrated that the power output of the joint-free structure 
is higher than that of the Ag-interconnected TEG with the same architecture 
(Mytafides et al. 2021).  

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     165 
In 2017, Zhou et al. reported joint-free TEG devices wherein CNT films 
(96 mm × 10 mm) with a thickness of ∼3 μm were patterned into p- and  
n-type regions to eliminate the metal joint (Zhou et al. 2017). The SWCNT 
sheet (p-type) transferred onto a PET substrate was alternately masked with 
thin PET double-side adhesive taps, and the unmasked regions were doped 
by drop-casting PEI to produce n-type legs. Then, a joint-free p–n patterned 
sheet was folded, and a compact multilayer p–n stuck structure with 
dimensions of 16 mm × 10 mm was fabricated (see Figure 6.10). Due to the 
relatively high power factor of these CNT legs (p-type: 1,840 μW·m−1·K−2 
and n-type: ~1,500 μW·m−1·K−2) as well as the joint-free structure, the 
modules consisting of three p–n couples produced a maximum power of  
2.51 μW at a ΔT of 27.5 K, which corresponds to a power density of  
0.26 μW·cm−2 (167 μW·cm−2 when normalized to the total area and the  
cross-sectional area).

In these 2D π-shaped modules, the temperature gradient must be applied 
in the in-plane direction. However, as most of the waste heat is emitted in 
the out-of-plane direction (e.g. body heat), such a π-shaped configuration 
limits its application. Thus, TEG modules that can harvest heat in the  

166     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
out-of-plane direction are required. Therefore, 3D TEGs with vertically 
aligned TE legs have been proposed. An et al. demonstrated a 3D vertical 
TEG by stacking 20 layers of 10 2D p–n couples to fully use the temperature 
gradient in the vertical direction (see Figure 6.11), and a maximum power 
output of 123 μW was achieved at a ΔT of 20 K, which means that the power 
output of the module normalized by the number of couples was 0.6 µW (An 
et al. 2017).

module consisting of 200 p–n couples. Reproduced with permission

Using the foldable feature of CNT sheets, Kim et al. also developed a 3D 
structure of the CNT TEG. The paper sheet with a length of 1.5 cm and a 
breadth of 24 cm (area 36 cm2) having 38 p-type and 37 n-type CNT legs 
was folded using a double-sided adhesive tape (see Figure 6.12) (Kim et al. 
2019). The folded legs with a length of 1.5 cm and projected area of  
2.25 cm2 exhibit maximum powers of 1.1, 4.4 and 10.3 μW at the vertical 
ΔT values of 10, 20 and 30 K, respectively. Based on the open-circuit 
voltages, they estimated that approximately 50% of the ΔT was used in the 
3D vertical TEG. The maximum power densities of the device normalized 
by the projected area (2.25 cm2) were calculated to be 0.5, 2.0 and  
4.6 μW cm−2 at the vertical ΔT values of 10, 20 and 30 K, respectively, but 
those normalized by the area of the paper (36 cm2) were 0.03, 0.12 and  
0.29 μW cm−2, respectively. These values are lower than those of the 2D CNT 
TEG reported by An et al. (2.0 μW·cm−2 at ΔT = 20 K) (An et al. 2017), 
which is likely due to lower power factors (p-type: 411 μW·m−1·K−2; n-type:  
90.2 μW·m−1·K−2) of the TE sheet used compared to those of An et al.  
(p-type: 2,252 μW·m−1·K−2; n-type: 3,103 μW·m−1·K−2). Additionally, in the 
case of 2D TEG sheets, both the cold and hot sides were temperature 
controlled by an external temperature controller, and the temperature 
gradient could be fully used. The cold side of the 3D vertical TEG is usually 
uncontrolled (cooled by air atmosphere), and the temperature is often 

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     167 
different from room temperature. Hence, difficulty of fair comparison in this 
area arises.

Lee et al. developed a 3D CNT TEG using porous CNT foams, where 
SWCNT slurries were poured into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold 
and subjected to drying at a reduced pressure to form porous foams (Lee et 
al. 2019). SWCNT slurries were doped with FeCl3 and BV for p- and n-type 
doping, respectively, and the doped p-and n-type legs were connected using 
silver paste. In this approach, thick films were easily prepared with a small 
amount of CNTs because of the large porous structure, which helps in using 
the applied vertical direction temperature gradients. As a result, a maximum 
power output of 1.5 μW at a ΔT of 13.9 K was obtained, corresponding to a 
high output power by weight of 82 μW·g−1.  
Dörling et al. proposed a unique toroidal geometry to convert a 2D flat 
film into a 3D architecture. The structure was prepared by connecting the  
p- and n-type legs with silver paste, folding into a spiral with adjacent 
couples (electrically in series) and finally joining to form a torus (see  
Figure 6.13) (Dörling et al. 2016). Because of this 3D architecture, the 
temperature difference between the skin surface and air can be used. The 
fabrication of joint-free TEG devices requires patterning of the p- and n-type 
legs to fabricate alternative assemblies of p- and n-type areas onto CNT sheets. 
However, both drop-casting and brushing/printing techniques resulted in a  
low resolution of the patterning due to the capillarity effect of the fibrous  
CNT network structure (Sun et al. 2020). On the other hand, they used

photo-induced switching from p-type to n-type for patterning. Upon UV 
irradiation, 
an 
initially 
p-type 
composite 
comprising 
P3HT 
and  
nitrogen-doped MWCNTs changed to n-type. This approach can avoid the 
diffusion issue of solution doping and greatly simplify the production of TEGs. 
When one side of this module with 15 double legs was attached to a glass filled 
with ice water, it generated a voltage of 5 mV and power of 10 μW.

Yamaguchi et al. developed a novel approach for the n-doping of 
SWCNT sheets by thermal evaporation of o-MeO-DMBI iodide and used 
this approach for the patterning of SWCNT sheets into p-n couples 
(Yamaguchi et al. 2021). In this TEG module, a patterned 2D SWCNT sheet 
was designed to generate power in the in-plane direction by harvesting the 
temperature gradient in the out-of-plane direction. To realize this concept, a 
thermal conductor (Cu wire) was attached between the p- and n-type regions 
of the patterned SWCNT sheet, and the other area was passivated by a 
thermal insulator (see Figure 6.14). Four p–n couples of the 2D CNT TEG 
generated a power of 96.1 nW, corresponding to a power density of  
60 nW cm-2. In this concept, minimizing the pattern pitch can further 
increase the power density.

6.7. TEG fabrication based on CNT-based ink 
An advantage of CNTs is their solution processability when dispersed in 
solvents. The solution can be used as an “ink” to fabricate TEG structures 
through a variety of methods such as screen printing, inkjet printing, 
dispenser printing, spray printing and spin coating (Nandihalli et al. 2020) 
(Hong et al. 2015). To prepare CNT ink with good processability,  
de-bundling of CNTs is highly important; thus, the addition of dispersants is 
necessary. For this reason, CNT inks often contain polymers or small 
surfactants as dispersants. 
Suemori et al. reported a pioneering work that described the fabrication 
of TEGs on flexible film substrates using CNT/polystyrene composite ink 
dispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (see Figure 6.15) (Suemori et al. 2013). 
They fabricated a TEG with CNT ink through a screen printing process. 
After the composite solution was dried, the printing mask was removed from 
the substrate and a gold electrode was attached on top by vacuum deposition. 
The TEG composed of 1,985 legs (1.5 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.15 mm) was 
operated in the out-of-plane direction, and a power output of approximately 
5.5 μW cm-2 at a ΔT of 70 K was achieved. 
 In 2015, Hong et al. fabricated a 2D π-shaped TEG by spray printing 
through a shadow mask using a p-type CNT/P3HT composite ink on a 
polyimide substrate (Hong et al. 2015). In this TEG, 41 p-type lines with a 
width of 1 mm and a length of 15 mm were connected in series using a silver 
electrode. This device produced a power of 32.7 nW at a ΔT of 10 K.

Although these works fabricated TEG only with p-type CNT legs, to 
fabricate an efficient TEG module, n-type legs need to be connected 
alternatively to minimize parasitic electrical resistance and to facilitate the 
heat transfer into the system; thus, a doping technique to convert p-type 
CNTs into n-type is necessary. When the proper dispersants are chosen, the 
dispersants work as a dopant to tune p-type into n-type; thus, post-doping 
after the printing process can be avoided. Such advantages enable various 
TEG structures composed of multiple p–n assemblies in a simple printing 
process. To produce high-quality printable TE inks with high performance, it 
is important to produce high-quality dispersions with the appropriate 
viscosity depending on the design, application and substrate. 
In 2018, Park et al. designed a bracelet-type TEG structure wherein the 
CNT ink was printed onto a flexible polyurethane cable (see Figure 6.16) 
(Park et al. 2018). CNT inks were prepared using polyacrylic acid (PAA) 
and PEI as p- and n-dopants, respectively, in solvents such as diethylene 
glycol. By optimizing the concentration of the dopants and solvents, 
clogging of inks in the nozzle can be avoided while making them sufficiently 
viscous for printing on any curved surface. Because of the 3D structure, the 
device was operated in the out-of-plane direction of the heat source. The 
flexible TEG based on 60 couples of p- and n-doped CNT ink obtained a 
maximum power output of 1.95 μW at a ΔT of 30 K. The ease of installation 
of the bracelet-type TEG on heat sources with various shapes and its ability  
 
 

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     171 
to harvest waste heat in the out-of-plane direction of the heat source has 
significant potential as a flexible/wearable power conversion device. 
Because of the ease of printing, the number of p–n pairs can be easily 
increased without any additional assembly process.

Mytafides et al. used dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as dispersants, as well as the 
dopant of SWCNTs in water and prepared p- and n-type aqueous inks, 
respectively (Mytafides et al. 2021). Initially, the p-type CNT ink was 
printed on a flexible polyimide substrate using a blade coating technique to 
prepare p-type legs, and then, using the same technique, the n-type ink was 
printed to create a continuous electric path consisting of 116 p–n legs. It is 
also worth noting the remarkable power factors of 145 and 127 μW mK-2 
achieved for the p-type and n-type films, respectively, at room temperature. 
In this configuration, highly conductive SWCNT networks are also 
employed as joints between the p–n regions, which realize an all-carbon 
TEG without metal deposition. As a result, the 2D π-shaped TEG module 
exhibited a remarkable power output of 342 μW at a ΔT = 150 K  
(TH = 175°C) with an internal resistance of 806 Ω. The use at high 
temperatures (up to 200°C) is one of the advantages of CNTs with excellent 
thermal stability.

6.8. CNT yarn and their fabric 
CNT or CNT/polymer composite fibers can be fabricated from CNT ink 
or CNT/polymer composite inks. These fibers are also candidates for the 
fabrication of TEG modules. Kim et al. reported a TEG fabricated from a 
CNT fiber composited with PEDOT:PSS, where the CNT/PEDOT:PSS 
fibers were synthesized by ball milling the dispersion of SWCNTs by 
PEDOT:PSS to make an ink paste and then spinning the paste in methanol 
for coagulation (Kim et al. 2018). The PEI solution was filtered through the 
CNT/PEDOT:PSS fibers to prepare n-type fibers. The p-type and n-type 
CNT/PEDOT:PSS fibers thus obtained exhibited power factors of 83.2 ± 6.4  
and 113 ± 25 μW·m−1·K−2, respectively. As a result, 12 p–n couples of the 
TEG obtained an output power of 0.430 μW at a ΔT of 10 K. 
Recently, electronic textiles (e-textiles) have attracted increasing 
attention for the development of smart textiles to enhance textile 
functionalities including sensing, energy harvesting and active heating and 
cooling. For this purpose, the integration of TEG into textiles has been 
investigated using various TE materials, including inorganic, organic and 
their hybrids. In particular, CNT-based TE materials are attractive because 
of their ease of fiber fabrication and textile compatibility. 
In 2017, Ito et al. (2017) first demonstrated the integration of CNT 
threads into fabrics (see Figure 6.17(a)). To fabricate the CNT thread, 
surfactant-dispersed SWCNTs were mixed with polyethylene glycol to 
reinforce the thread, and the dispersion was injected into methanol to induce 
coagulation. One of the technical issues in integrating CNT threads into 
fabric is the periodic patterning of CNT threads into p–n regions. For 
periodic n-doping of the p-type CNT thread, part of the CNT thread was 
dipped into 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]PF6) 
used as an n-dopant to create a p–n striped pattern. The stripe-patterned 
thread was sewn into a felt fabric (ca. 3 mm in thickness) with a sewing 
needle such that the n-type and p-type sections traversed the fabric in the 
downward and upward directions, respectively. The TE fabric thus obtained 
exhibited ca. 8 nW at a ΔT =25 K. In this 3D π-shaped structure, thick felt 
functioned as an efficient thermal insulator, allowing effective utilization of 
the temperature gradient.

Choi et al. reported a novel patterning method using a CNT yarn, and the 
patterned yarn was used as a 3D π-shaped TEG (see Figure 6.17(b)) (Choi  
et al. 2017). The CNT yarns were synthesized by the floating catalyst 
method and directly spun around a PDMS rectangular support. The CNT 
yarns on one side of the support were doped with FeCl3 for p-doping, and 
that on the front side were doped with PEI solutions for n-doping. The CNT 
yarns on the other two sides were left undoped as electrodes. The obtained 
3D π-shaped TEG showed an exceptional power density of 697 μW·g−1 at a 
ΔT of 40 K with 60 couples of p- and n-type CNT yarns, primarily because 
of the extremely high power factor of the p-type (2,387 µW m−1 K−2) and  
n-type (2,456 µW m−1 K−2) regions. This research strongly suggests an 
advantage of the CNT yarn directly spun from the synthesis furnace. 
Additionally, the patterning method is also useful for CNT-based TEG 
fabrics because of their strong scalability. 
Recently, several attempts have been made to fabricate large-area  
CNT-based TE fabrics. Zheng et al. developed a simple process to prepare 
p–n patterns for CNT yarns (Zheng et al. 2020). In this process, the CNT 
yarn is wrapped onto a thin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plate and rolled 
into a cylindrical structure (see Figure 6.18). Subsequently, the CNT yarn on 

174     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
the PET roll is soaked in a PEDOT:PSS solution with a controlled dipping 
time, and the roll is flipped over and immersed into a PEI/ethanol solution 
with a certain doping time. After reinforcing with the PET fiber, the 
patterned CNT yarn is sewn into the warp-knitted spacer fabric using a 
needle. The optimally designed TEG with good wearability and stability 
shows a high output power density of 5.15 μW cm-2 and an extremely high 
specific power of 244.6 μW g-1 at ΔT of 47.5 K. In addition to their high 
power factor of the CNT/PEDOT:PSS composite yarn (512.8 μW mK-2) as 
well as the PEI/CNT yarn (667.8 μW mK-2), sophisticated design to integrate 
CNT yarns into TE fabric offers high power density.

In 2020, Sun et al. reported a π-shaped CNT-based TE fabric that is 
directly woven into textiles, instead of embedding it into clothes using CNT 
fibers prepared by twisting CNT films (Sun et al. 2020). To create p–n 
patterns, p-doping was carried out by dipping into PEDOT:PSS solution and 
n-doping was performed with an electrospray of n-dopant solution using 
polymer as a mask. It is important to note that the electrospray doping 
method generates monodispersed microdroplets containing a doping solution 
with repulsive electric charges. They proved that this method is superior to 
the conventional dipping method, which has a low patterning resolution due 
to diffusion. TE fibers with alternatively doped n- and p-segments were 
wrapped with acrylic fibers to avoid a short circuit (see Figure 6.19). 
Patterned CNT fibers were used to fabricate alternately interlocked TE loops 
that offer thermal resistance matching as well as excellent stretchability. The 

Nanocarbon Materials as Thermoelectric Generators     175 
TEG textile composed of interlocked TE loops shows a peak power density 
of 7.0 μWcm−2 for a ΔT of 44 K.

Importantly, they compared their performance in terms of specific power 
density, in which the power density was normalized to the temperature 
difference squared ΔT2 because the power is proportional to the squared 
temperature difference. Such a comparison is reasonable when considering 
the diversity of the given temperature differences studied in different reports. 
As a result, the output performance of the TEG was 35 μWm−2K−2 with a  
16 mm repeat length, and this value was superior to that of other flexible 
CNT TEGs (Mai et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2014; Hewitt et al. 2012; Toshima et al. 
2015; Choi et al. 2016; Ito et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2017). 
6.9. Conclusion 
In this chapter, current understandings of TE properties of CNTs and 
their control methods mainly based on the chemical doping method are 
summarized. Especially, large progress in the TE studies for semiconducting 
SWCNT is highlighted. Also, the progress of n-doping technology in these 
10 years is discussed. Developments of the fabrication and purification 
technology of CNT will offer further progress of the TE properties. In 
addition, the history of the developments of TEGs based on CNTs is 
summarized in terms of the TEG structure. Starting from the 2D π-shape 
configuration, recent developments have focused on the 3D π-shaped 

176     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
structure to use the temperature gradient perpendicular to the surface. In 
particular, the embedding of the π-shaped structure into a fabric using CNT 
fiber has attracted significant attention owing to its low density and 
compatibility with wearable applications.

7.1. Introduction 
In the middle of the 19th century, William Thomson, known as Lord 
Kelvin, discovered that heat is released or absorbed in proportion to an 
amplitude of electrical current and temperature difference in a conductor 
(Thomson 1851). In the original experimental setup shown in Figure 7.1, an 
electric current passed through a U-shaped Fe rod. Two electrical resistance 
coils, R1 and R2, were wound to form a detector and were connected to the 
Wheatstone bridge. The bottom of the U-shaped Fe rod was then heated, 
which yielded two temperature gradients, a positive one extending from A to 
C, and a negative one extending from C to B (Duckworth 1960). This 
thermoelectric effect is referred to as the Thomson effect. When a charge 
current density j and a temperature gradient dT/dx are applied to a conductor, 
the heat production rate per unit volume may be described as

where μ is defined as the Thomson coefficient, and σ is the electrical 
conductivity. The first term is the thermodynamically irreversible Joule heat, 
and the second term is the Thomson heat. The Thomson effect is the only 
thermoelectric effect that can occur in a single and homogeneous conductor 
unlike the Seebeck effect and Peltier effect (Seebeck 1825; Peltier 1834). 
Therefore, combining the thermoelectric Kelvin relation (Thomson 1854), 
the measurement of the Thomson coefficient μ provides the means of 
experimentally determining the absolute Seebeck coefficient known as an 
absolute scale of thermoelectricity.

conductor is also shown on the right 
With recent advancements in thermophysical property metrology, such as 
the development of new thermoelectric standard reference materials (SRMs) 
(Lowhorn et al. 2009; Lenz et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2021), and international 
comparisons (Wang et al. 2013; Alleno et al. 2015) – it may be helpful to 
revisit the fundamentals of the measurement methods pertaining to the 
Thomson effect. We note that there are excellent general reviews (Martin  
et al. 2010; Borup et al. 2015; Akinaga et al. 2020) and books (Macdonald 
1962; Blatt and Schroeder 1978; Rowe 1995; Nolas et al. 2001; Tritt 2004)

are few reports specifically addressing Thomson heat measurements, and 
fewer regarding the metrological application to the absolute scale of 
thermoelectricity. 
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a fundamental concept of 
Thomson heat measurements and the application to the absolute scale of 
thermoelectricity. We begin with a brief review of the measurement 
principle of the absolute Seebeck coefficient. General concepts such as the 
Kelvin relation in the thermoelectric effect are introduced at a conceptual 
level. The content is then organized in the measurement methods of 
Thomson heat measurements. A description of the conventional method and 
the recently developed AC–DC method, along with a 2ω technique, and a  
lock-in thermal imaging technique, are provided with an outlook and summary. 
7.2. Absolute scale of thermoelectricity 
The Seebeck coefficient S, also known as thermoelectric power or 
thermopower, is defined as the ratio of the induced thermoelectric voltage

The Seebeck coefficient appears to be conceptually simple; however, it is 
actually cumbersome to determine the absolute value accurately. As shown 
in Figure 7.2, a thermoelectric voltage VAB experimentally observed in the 
open-circuit condition can be expressed as (Ziman 1972)

where T and T + ΔT are the temperatures at the edges of the sample. SA and 
SB are the Seebeck coefficients of the conductor A (sample) and the 
conductor B (two voltage leads), respectively. This circuit analysis indicates 
that while the Seebeck coefficient can be clearly defined for a single and 

186     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
homogeneous conductor, the measured thermoelectric voltage in popular 
thermocouple experiments is always proportional to the difference between 
the Seebeck coefficient of the sample of interest (A) and that of the reference 
voltage leads (B). Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient of the reference voltage 
leads must be determined with a separate experiment.  
 
Figure 7.2. The schematic illustration of the Seebeck effect. The sample of  
interest (A) is connected with the voltmeter through the voltage leads (B) 
Superconductors can be used as Seebeck reference materials in  
low-temperature regions, as they essentially have a zero Seebeck coefficient 
well below their transition temperature Tc. This intrinsic superconductor 
property occurs because electric currents, induced by the temperature 
gradient in the superconductor, are canceled by supercurrent counterflows in 
accordance with the Meissner effect (Ginzburg 1990). Thus, by making one 
of the wires (see conductor B in Figure 7.2) in a thermocouple from a 
superconducting material, it is possible to directly measure the absolute 
Seebeck coefficient. In particular, high-Tc superconductors, such as 
YBa2Cu3O7-x (Uher 1987) and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O8+δ (Amagai et al. 2020), may 
be useful because they could offer a wide operating temperature range above 
liquid nitrogen temperature.  
Similarly, the Thomson coefficient measurement is indispensable as a 
means of experimentally determining the absolute Seebeck coefficient of a 
reference material at high temperatures (above approximately 100 K), where 
superconducting reference materials are no longer used. Originally proposed 
by William Thomson, known as Lord Kelvin, the above three thermoelectric 
effects are combined with Kelvin’s relation (Thomson 1854). Kelvin’s 
relation is a specific case of Onsager’s reciprocal relations (Onserger  
1931a, 1931b; Callen 1948). As such, this relation involves microscopic 
reversibility, a fundamental principle in physics. The Thomson effect links

The Kelvin relation was verified for several thermocouple pairs of metals 
measured on the same sample. A large amount of data was compiled, and the 
relation between S and π/T appearing in the second relation in equation [7.5] 
was reasonably close to the theoretically predicted value obtained from 
Onsager’s reciprocal relations within the measurement uncertainty. Thus, the 
validity of the Kelvin relation, a special case of Onserger’s reciprocal ratio, 
can be accepted with considerable confidence (Miller 1960). 
Combining Kelvin’s relations, the Thomson coefficient μ can be related

In this manner, an absolute scale of thermoelectricity can be established 
at high temperatures. Historically, Pb has long been used as a Seebeck 
reference material because of its small Seebeck coefficient (less than  
1 μV/V) and relatively high superconducting transition temperature of 
approximately 7 K. In the early 20th century, the first absolute scale of 

188     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
thermoelectricity for Pb was established by superconducting thermocouple 
experiments, in which one couple consists of superconducting material, and 
from the indirect measurement of the Thomson heat of Pb (Borelius et al. 
1932). To reevaluate the scale, Nb3Sn, which has a higher TC of 23 K, was 
employed in a thermocouple experiment as a reference from 18 K to 20 K, 
and the scale was calculated by the superconducting experiments using 
Nb3Sn as a reference, and Borelius’ values obtained by the indirect 
measurement of the Thomson coefficient (Christian et al. 1958). Although 
Pb seems an appropriate choice in this context, its practical use as a 
reference material is limited because of the difficulty in fabricating 
sufficiently thin wires, in addition to the toxic properties of this element. 
Instead, Pt and Cu wires are routinely employed. Subsequently, the scale 
was extended up to 1,300 K for Cu and 2,000 K for Pt by compiling the 
available data (Cusack and Kendall 1958). Direct thermocouple experiments 
for Pt using a Pb wire as a reference from 80 K to 400 K were also 
performed to recalculate Cusack’s high-temperature scale in the 1970s 
(Moore and Graves 1973). However, a direct measurement of the Thomson 
coefficient of Pb has not been made since the establishment of the absolute 
scale of thermoelectricity by Borelius. We note that Borelius’s values for the 
Thomson coefficient were obtained indirectly from measurements of the 
Thomson heat of an alloy and subsequent thermocouple experiments relative 
to the same alloy. For this reason, the direct measurement of the Thomson 
coefficient of high-purity Pb was performed over a complete temperature 
range of 4–300 K (Roberts 1977a). The values for μ agree with those from 
the superconducting thermocouple experiment by Christian et al. from 10 K 
to 17 K, and with those from the indirect measurements of Borelius et al. 
from 80 K to 300 K. However, Roberts found that from 17 K to 80 K, 
disagreement with the values used by Christian et al. to construct their 
absolute scale of thermoelectricity leads to a significant change in the scale 
of approximately 0.3 μV/K from 30 K to 300 K, corresponding to a relative 
error of 30%.  
Today, the modern standard was established by Roberts’ results for Pb 
from 10 K to 300 K (Roberts 1977b) for Cu between 273 K and 900 K, for 
Pt between 273 K and 1,600 K and for W between 273 K and 1,800 K, 
obtained from direct measurements of the Thomson coefficient (Roberts 
1981; Roberts et al. 1985). The measurement uncertainty at the highest 
temperatures for Pt was estimated to be 0.2 μV/K. For Pb in the range from 
10 K to 300 K, the measurement uncertainty was estimated to be 0.01 µV/K. 
Recently, Burkov provided an empirical interpolation function for the 
Seebeck coefficient of Pt between 70 K and 1,500 K according to the new 

Precise Measurement of the Absolute Seebeck Coefficient from the Thomson Effect     189 
absolute scale (Burkov et al. 2001). The present absolute scales for Pb, Pt, 
Cu and W are shown in Figure 7.3(a). The enlarged view of the Seebeck 
coefficient in Pb in Figure 7.3(b) indicates the discrepancy between the 
previous scale by Christian and the present scale by Roberts. The unexpected 
change near 20 K causes a great difference in the shape of the calculated 
Seebeck coefficients of Pb between the two scales, as Seebeck coefficients 
are as small as 1 μV/K. These results have served as the ultimate foundation 
for nearly all subsequent thermocouple experiments performed to determine 
the Seebeck coefficient, as well as continuing theoretical research over the 
half century.

7.3. Measurement methods of the Thomson effect 
Accurate measurements of the Thomson coefficient are typically 
expensive and time intensive, in part because of the difficulty in isolating a 
single sample and measuring the low Thomson heat. Early accurate 
measurements of the Thomson effect were conducted for several pure metals 
by measuring the temperature profile of the conductors instead of measuring 
the heat flow caused by the Thomson effect (Nettleton 1912, 1921; Lander 
1948). The Thomson effect at low temperatures has received considerable 
attention from theoretical perspectives, such as in considering the Seebeck

effect in alkaline and transition metals (Pearson and Templeton 1958; 
Macdonald 1962; Maxwell et al. 1967). In the establishment of the absolute 
scale, a differential thermocouple technique was employed to measure the 
temperature difference between two parallel insulated wires subject to the 
same temperature gradient, but with DC current flowing through them in 
opposite directions (Roberts 1977b). However, until now, there has been 
little conceptual development of new methods since early developments by 
Nettleton (1912). Recently, new methods that employ AC and DC current 
signals have been developed: an AC–DC method (Amagai et al. 2015, 
2019a, 2020), a 2ω technique (Dunn et al. 2019) and a thermoelectric 
imaging technique (Uchida et al. 2020). At sufficiently high frequencies, the 
Thomson effect can be canceled out, which allows the small Thomson heat 
to be extracted from the large Joule heat. Most importantly, the use of both 
AC and DC currents significantly simplifies the expression of the Thomson 
coefficient and compensates for the heat loss from the sample to its 
surroundings. Meanwhile, the 2ω technique is a phase-sensitive method that 
uses the response at the second harmonic of the excitation frequency of the 
electrical resistance oscillation in the sample, which is directly proportional 
to the Thomson coefficient. The phase-sensitive method has a distinctive 
advantage over a DC detection technique, because a small AC voltage can be 
extracted from high background noise. The thermoelectric imaging 
technique uses a non-contact lock-in thermography technique to detect the 
small Thomson heat. This method is proven to be a powerful tool for 
evaluating the magnetic dependence of the Thomson effect and may be 
applicable for the determination of the Thomson coefficient.  
7.3.1. Conventional method 
If a DC current I passes through the sample along the temperature 
gradient, the measured temperature change of the sample is attributed to two 
main factors. The first is Joule heating, which is proportional to the square of 
the current amplitude. The second is the Thomson effect, which is 
proportional to the current amplitude. As Joule heating occurs, the Thomson 
effect is changed from heating to cooling by reversing the current through 
the sample. Thus, the contribution of the Joule effect can be eliminated by 
averaging both temperatures. Then, applying some algebra directly produces 
the Thomson coefficient (Nettleton 1912):

Here, K is the thermal conductance, defined as K ≡ κa/l, where a and l are 
the cross-sectional area and length of the sample, respectively, and ΔT 
represents the temperature difference across the sample. Moreover, ΔTDC 
caused by the Thomson effect is calculated from ΔTDC ≡ (T+DC − T−DC)/2. In 
addition, T+DC and T−DC correspond to the temperature at the middle of the 
sample when positive and negative DC currents are applied, respectively. 
Experimentally, the Thomson coefficient, given by equation [7.9], was 
measured using the configuration depicted in Figure 7.4 (Nettleton 1921). 
The sample was mechanically clamped to a wound heat reservoir to yield a 
temperature gradient along the sample. The temperature was applied to the 
cylindrical Cu heat sink. The surrounding temperature of the sample was 
maintained at the same temperature as that of the cold side of the reservoir. 
A detecting coil made from insulated Cu was attached to the middle of the 
sample. This innovative technique allows accurate determination of the 
Thomson coefficient and has been employed in many experiments; however, 
we note that equation [7.9] was derived in an ideal isothermal condition, 
where the heat loss from the sample is disregarded. Furthermore, prior 
information regarding the thermal conductivity value of the sample and the 
sample’s dimensions is required, which would make the measurements time 
intensive.

7.3.2. New measurement methods: AC–DC method 
The full amount of heat created by the Thomson effect or Joule effect is 
used to heat or cool the sample, while disregarding the heat loss from the 
sample. Accordingly, the temperature profile of the sample is T−T0, where T0 
is the environmental temperature, normalized by the temperature difference 
of the sample ΔT, defined as TH − TC, and will resemble the black solid 
curves in Figure 7.5(a) in the absence of radiative heat loss. Here, Th and Tc 
are hot and cold sides of the temperature of the sample, respectively. Black 
solid curves were obtained for μI/K = 0, ± 3. The temperature increases at 
the middle of the sample, corresponding to x/l = 0.5, induced by applying a 
positive and negative DC current and is measured, and equation [7.10] 
produces an accurate Thomson coefficient. In practice, however, the sample 
will exchange heat with the environment as radiative heat. Correspondingly, 
the temperature profiles will resemble the lower dotted black curves in  
Figure 7.5(a). Consequently, equation [7.9] will erroneously yield a 
Thomson coefficient that is too low, even if the other parameters such as the 
thermal conductivity or sample geometry are measured accurately. In the 
measurement configuration shown in Figure 7.5(b), simply adding an AC 
current source to a conventional configuration solves this problem 
completely by accounting for the temperature increase ΔTAC caused by an 
AC current that is equivalent to the DC current I: AC–DC method. The 
underlying concept of the AC–DC method is that most of the radiative heat 
loss occurring during the measurement of ΔTAC and ΔTDC can be 
compensated for by calculating the ratio of the two signals. If we now 
consider the radiative coupling to the environment by simulating the 
temperature profile based on the heat transfer equation, the Thomson 
coefficient in equation [7.9] can be expanded to the leading order using χ:

sample heat loss due to radiative heat transfer. In contrast, upon rearranging

We note that the first correction term appearing in equation [7.10] is 
reduced by a factor of 6 upon calculating the ratio of the temperature 
changes ΔTDC and ΔTAC in equation [7.11]. Therefore, compensating for 
radiative heat loss requires only two additional measurements: Joule heat 
measurement and electrical resistance measurement. These measurements 
require much less effort than other approaches, such as the use of multiple

buffers or accurate temperature control of thermal shields. Most importantly, 
the proposed formula in equation [7.12] does not require prior knowledge of 
the thermal conductivity and emissivity of the sample, unlike the 
conventional formula [7.9]. 
The uncompensated Thomson coefficient values of Pt, obtained directly 
from equation [7.9], together with the compensated values using equation 
[7.12] and their fully corrected values obtained using equation [7.11], are 
shown in Figure 7.6(a) for a relatively long sample (13.8 mm in length). As 
expected from the strong temperature dependence involving heat loss, in 
accordance with the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the difference between the 
uncompensated values obtained from equation [7.9] and the compensated 
curves obtained based on equation [7.12] becomes more significant as the 
temperature increases, reaching approximately 31% at 300 K. Note that there 
is little difference between the fully corrected curve according to equation 
[7.11] and the compensated curve according to equation [7.12]. From the 
above results, the proposed compensation approach provides an accurate 
value of the Thomson coefficient in non-critical scenarios. Finally, it may be 
worth mentioning that the AC–DC method can be applied not only to a thin 
wire sample, but also to a thin-film sample fabricated on a substrate. It is 
likely that such a compensation mechanism also applies to the heat loss 
passing through a substrate from the thin-film sample to the heat reservoir, 
as long as the heat flows in only one direction (Fujiki 2021).

Once the Thomson coefficient is measured, the Seebeck coefficient S is 
calculated from the measured Thomson coefficient using Kelvin’s relation 
and a superconductor as a reference. Computation of the S value from the 
measured Thomson coefficient data involves the following steps: the value 
obtained from the superconductor reference (YBa2Cu3O7-δ) at 85 K is taken 
as the starting point, and subsequent calculations are performed by 
integrating the measured Thomson coefficient normalized with the 
temperature under the curve in Figure 7.6(a). The computed Seebeck 
coefficients with and without compensation are shown in Figure 7.7 along 
with the reference data (Moore and Graves 1973). The data computed from 
the compensated value show good agreement with the reference value within 
the expanded uncertainty.

the experiment for the measurement of the Thomson coefficient will be 
extremely simplified so that new techniques can be employed to provide 
local calibrations of a Seebeck voltage lead (measurement of the absolute 
Seebeck coefficient of the lead) to meet most of the laboratories’ 
requirements. These advances will bring thermophysical property metrology 
much closer to the International System of Units (SI), and ensure the 
reliability of the characterization of thermoelectric materials, potentially 
including thermoelectric devices and modules. Moreover, the measurement 
uncertainty can undoubtedly be reduced. The presently accepted absolute 
scale of thermoelectricity was established more than 40 years ago. These 
new techniques may answer the question of whether there are errors in the 
present absolute scale. Combining the modern measurement standards and 
instruments, we believe that recent advances in techniques used to measure 
the Thomson heat represent useful tools to reevaluate the absolute scale of 
thermoelectricity.

8.1. Introduction 
The flash method has been established as the standard method for 
measuring the thermal diffusivity of high density solid materials such as 
metals, alloys, ceramics and semiconductors (Parker et al. 1961; Righini  
et al. 1973; Baba et al. 2001; Akoshima et al. 2013). It is widely used and 
commercial equipment is available. The metrological standard for thermal 
diffusivity was established under the Metric convention by the Working 
Group 9 on Thermophysical Quantity of the International Bureau of Weights 
and Measures (Bureau international des poids et mesures – BIPM), 
Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) (Baba 2010). Document 
standards for thermal diffusivity measurement have been published: ISO, 
ASTM International, etc. (Baba et al. 2014). Now, traceability of thermal 
diffusivity measurement for bulk materials has been globally established 
(Baba 2010, 2014).

Due to the rapid increase in the importance of thin films in modern 
materials science and industry, there is a strong need to establish techniques 
for measuring the thermal properties of thin films (Cahill et al. 2003; Baba 
2004; Dwyer et al. 2017; Petsagkourakis et al. 2018), and various 
experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted (Baba et al. 2011; 
Cahill et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015; Volz et al. 2016). 
In order to measure cross-plane heat transport properties of thin films 
with thickness from 10 nanometers to several micrometers, Paddock et al. 
invented the time-domain thermoreflectance method (TDTR method), which 
observes the surface temperature by the thermoreflectance method after 
impulse heating of the same surface by a femtosecond or picosecond pulse 
laser (Paddock et al. 1986). Most TDTR methods observe the cooling rate of 
the surface rather than the heat diffusion time over a certain length (Cahill  
et al. 2004; Collins et al. 2014). Therefore, instead of measuring the thermal 
diffusivity of the film, those methods basically measure the thermal 
effusivity of the second layer underneath the metal of the first layer, which is 
about 100 nanometers thick (Cahill et al. 2014). 
As a different approach from the TDTR method, ultrafast laser flash 
methods with a rear side heating-surface temperature (RF) arrangement were 
developed to quantitatively measure the cross-plane thermal diffusivity of 
the thin film (Taketoshi et al. 1999, 2001; Baba et al. 2011). In the ultrafast 
laser flash method, transient change in the surface temperature of the thin 
film is observed, and the thermal diffusivity of the thin film is determined by 
adapting the mathematical model to the transient temperature changes (Baba 
2009). The thin film is heated with an ultrashort pulse laser to observe 
transient temperature changes. Mode-Lock ultrashort pulse lasers oscillate 
periodic pulses with a fixed repetition frequency. Electrical delay technology 
allowed us to observe transient temperature changes for longer than the pulse 
interval (Taketoshi et al. 2005). 
In order to analyze transient temperature change observed by the 
electrical delay technology, conventional models have to be modified to 
correctly represent the actual thermal thermoreflectance signal (Taketoshi  
et al. 2005; Baba et al. 2011). Conventional models assume that the thin film 
is heated with a single pulse, but in reality, it is heated with a periodic pulse. 
As a result, conventional models fit only a limited time range, not the full 
range of pulse intervals. To solve this problem, a linear correction approach 
that assumes that the signal base reduction is linear is commonly adopted 
(Taketoshi et al. 2005). 

Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash Method     203 
 
However, the actual base reduction is not linear, so this approximation is 
only valid for a limited signal. In this chapter, a new analysis method for 
fitting the thermoreflectance signal after the Fourier transform is presented 
(Baba et al. 2021). The periodic temperature response is expanded by the 
Fourier series to realize curve fitting of the thermoreflectance signal over the 
entire range of pulse intervals. Thermal diffusivity of thin films is 
determined reliably with small evaluated uncertainty by the ultrafast laser 
flash with the Fourier expansion analysis. 
8.2. Laser flash method and ultrafast laser flash method 
8.2.1. Laser flash method 
Thermal conductivity λ is calculated by the formula λ = αcρ from the 
specific heat capacity c and the density ρ after thermal diffusivity α was 
measured by the ultrafast laser flash method or the conventional laser flash 
method. 
When thermal diffusivity of bulk material is measured by the laser flash 
method, as shown in Figure 8.1, the front face of the flat sample kept at a 
constant temperature is heated uniformly by a laser pulse (Parker et al. 
1961). Heat diffuses one-dimensionally from the heated face to the opposite 
face, and eventually the temperature over the sample becomes uniform. 
Since the normalized temperature rise rate on the back surface of the sample 
is proportional to the thermal diffusivity and inversely proportional to the 
square of the thickness of the sample, thermal diffusivity is calculated from 
the thickness of the sample and the heat diffusion time.

The following conditions are assumed as ideal (Parker et al. 1961; Baba  
et al. 2001): 
1) duration of the laser pulse is negligibly short compared with the heat 
diffusion time; 
2) the sample is adiabatic to the environment; 
3) the sample’s front face is heated uniformly; 
4) the temperature change of the sample’s rear face is measured precisely; 
5) the sample is dense, uniform and opaque; 
6) the change of thermal diffusivity due to the sample’s temperature rise 
after the pulse heating is negligibly small. 
Under the assumptions mentioned above, the temperature rise of the 
sample’s rear face is expressed by the following equation:

thermoreflectance apparatus under rear heating/front detection (RF) 
configuration. The temperature detection beam irradiates the front face of the 
thin film, and the heating beam irradiates the back face of the thin film 
through a transparent substrate. 
The heat diffusion time of the entire thin film of a known thickness is 
measured, and the thermal diffusivity of the thin film is directly calculated 
from the heat diffusion time and the thickness of the thin film by adapting 
the RF configuration. 
From the view point of derived property, the RF configuration is different 
from the front heating/front detection (FF) configuration, which observes 
temperature cooling after pulse heating, dominated by the thermal effusivity 
of the thin film and the substrate. 
 
Figure 8.3. Schematic of the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance  
measurement under rear heat/front detection (RF) configuration 
The thermal diffusivity of a thin film formed on a transparent  
substrate was measured by an ultrafast laser flash apparatus (PicoTR, 
NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH) in the research of this chapter. 

206     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
The apparatus uses two fiber lasers: one for heating and one for 
temperature detection by thermoreflectance, as shown in Figure 8.4. The 
wavelength of the heating beam is 1,550 nm and the wavelength of the 
temperature detection beam is 775 nm, which is converted from the 
fundamental wavelength of 1,550 nm by the second harmonic generator 
(SHG). The differential photodiode detects the reflected light of the 
temperature detection beam from the surface of the sample. The diameter of 
the heating beam focused on the sample is 45 μm, and that of the 
temperature detection beam is 25 μm. 
  
Figure 8.4. Block diagram of an ultrafast laser flash apparatus 
The heated light is modulated by a lithium niobate modulator (LN 
modulator) at a frequency of 200 kHz and the signal of the reflected light is 
amplified at this frequency by the lock-in amplifier. Only the amplitude 
output of the lock-in amplifier was used to maintain the linearity of the 
signal with respect to temperature changes (Baba et al. 2021). The phase 
output of the lock-in amplifier was not used (Taketoshi et al. 2003). 
The oscillating frequencies of the two fiber lasers are electrically 
controlled and synchronized at 20 MHz. Since the modulation frequency of 
200 kHz is only 1% of the pulse repetition frequency of 20 MHz, the 
amplitude output of the lock-in amplifier is not distorted and linearity to the 
light intensity was kept. 

Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash Method     207 
 
The delay time of the temperature detection pulse train from the heating 
pulse train is controlled by the function generator. This electrical delay 
technique (Taketoshi et al. 2005) has enabled the observation of 
thermoreflectance signals over the entire interval (50 nanoseconds) between 
periodic pulses. However, the conventional “optical delay technology” is 
limited to observe thermoreflectance signals shorter than the repetition 
period of traditional mode-locked lasers from 12 to 13 ns (Paddock et al. 
1986; Cahill et al. 2014; Collins et al. 2014). 
The platinum thin film deposited on the fused quartz substrate was 
measured under RF configuration. The thin film is deposited by sputtering 
and its thickness is 100 nanometers. The black plot in Figure 8.5 is the 
thermoreflectance signal observed from the thin film. This signal is observed 
for the same thin film sample by a different measurement from the 
measurement in the reference (Baba et al. 2021). The pump laser has a 
nominal repeat rate of 20 MHz, so the periodic pulse interval is  
50 nanoseconds. The sampling interval is 10 picoseconds.

8.2.2.2. Nanosecond pulsed light heating 
In order to measure thicker films up to a few micrometers, nanosecond 
pulse lasers were used for pulsed light heating (Yagi et al. 2011; Kakefuda  
et al. 2017; Hinterleitner et al. 2019). The rear face of the thin film is heated 
by a laser beam through the transparent substrate. A CW semi-conductor 
laser is used for the probe beam and the reflected light proportional to the 
real time temperature change is detected by the high speed photodiode, as 
shown in Figure 8.6. 
 
Figure 8.6. Block diagram of nanosecond  
thermoreflectance measurement apparatus 
The pulse width of the pump pulse is 2 ns and the pulse interval is 20 μs. 
The thin film is formed on a disk-shaped transparent substrate with a 
diameter of 10 mm or a square-shaped transparent substrate with a side of  
10 mm. 
The black plot in Figure 8.7 shows the thermoreflectance signal for 
titanium nitride thin films which are 680 nm thick, supplied from National 
Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) as a certified reference material (CRM) 
for cross-plane heat diffusion time of thin film by the ultrafast laser flash 
method of nanosecond pulsed light heating (Yagi et al. 2008).

According to the reciprocity of heat transfer, equation [8.25] under the 
front heating/rear detection (FR) configuration is equal to the temperature 
response under the rear heating/front detection (RF) configuration (Baba  
et al. 2020, 2021). 
8.3.5. Temperature response after periodic pulse heating 
8.3.5.1. Periodic pulse heating and Fourier series expansion 
As mentioned in the introduction, the model function in the time domain 
assumes single pulse heating. However, the thin film surface is heated by 
periodic pulses in the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance method. When 
irradiated with a periodic laser pulse with a frequency of 𝑓௥௘௣, the 
temperature response follows a periodic function along with the period of 
that frequency Δ𝑇= 1/𝑓௥௘௣. Since the periodic function can be expressed as 
a Fourier series, the periodic temperature response can also be expressed by 
the Fourier series. 
When the mth discrete value of the thermoreflectance signal is 𝑦௠, the 
Fourier coefficient 𝑌௡ derived from the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is 
given by the following equation (Baba et al. 2021). 
𝑌௡= ∑
𝑦௠∙exp(−𝑖2𝜋𝜈௡𝑚Δ𝑡)
ேିଵ

[8.26] 
𝜈௡=
𝑛
𝑁Δ𝑡(𝑛= 0,1,2, … , 𝑁−1) 

Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash Method     217 
 
where N is the number of samplings, Δ𝑡 is the sampling interval and 𝜈௡ is the 
frequency. Frequency 𝜈௡ is defined as a multiple of the sampling rate 1 Δ
⁄ 𝑡. 
However, its inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is given by the 
following equation: 
𝑦௠=
ଵ
ே∑
𝑌௡∙exp(𝑖2𝜋𝜈௡𝑚Δ𝑡)
ேିଵ
௡ୀ଴
  
[8.27] 
According to the sampling theorem, frequency components that exceed 
the Nyquist rate 1 2
⁄ Δ𝑡 are alias. 
Therefore, equation [8.27] can be converted as follows: 
𝑦௠=
ଵ
ே[𝑌଴+ ∑
𝑌௡∙exp(𝑖2𝜋𝜈௡𝑚Δ𝑡)
(ேିଵ) ଶ
⁄
௡ୀଵ
+ ∑
𝑌௡
തതത∙
(ேିଵ) ଶ
⁄
௡ୀଵ
exp(𝑖2𝜋𝜈ேି௡𝑚Δ𝑡)]  
[8.28] 
where 𝑌௡
തതത is a conjugate of 𝑌௡. 
Equation [8.28] can be thought of as a Fourier series of a periodic 
function with a period of 𝑁Δ𝑡. The period 𝑁Δ𝑡 corresponds to the interval of 
periodic pulses Δ𝑇. 
We already know that the thermoreflectance signal can be expressed by a 
transfer function 𝑌෨(𝜉), which is 
( )
fT ξ

of equation [8.22] under the front 
heating/fear detection (FF) configuration and 
( )
s
T ξ

of equation [8.24] under 
the front heating/rear detection (FR) configuration. Therefore, the Fourier 
coefficient 𝑌௡ follows the transfer function 𝑌෨(𝜉) in the frequency domain. 
If we define the complex frequency as 𝜉௡= 𝑖2𝜋𝜈௡, the regression model 
can be expressed as follows: 
𝑌௡= 𝑌෨൫𝜈௡, 𝑘෠ᇱ, 𝜏௙ෝ, 𝛾ො൯+ 𝜀  
[8.29] 
where 𝑘෠′, 𝜏௙ෝ and 𝛾ො are the estimates of the constant of proportionality 𝑘′, 
heat diffusion time 𝜏௙ and ratio of virtual heat source 𝛾, respectively. 𝜀 is an 
error term that expresses the residual. This regression model is valid in the 
frequency domain below the Nyquist rate. The coefficient at frequency 
zero 𝑌଴ is excluded. Note that the four parameters 𝜈௡, 𝑘෠ᇱ, 𝜏௙ෝ, 𝛾ො are real 
numbers, but 𝑌௡, 𝑌෨(𝜈௡, 𝑘෠ᇱ, 𝜏௙ෝ, 𝛾ො) and 𝜀 are complex numbers.

Figure 8.10 shows the relationship between the temperature response of

After determining the model function by regression analysis in the

When we consider the front face heating/rear detection (FR)

The coefficients at frequency zero contain only information about the 
baseline. The corresponding values already derived from the DFT can be 
used. 
Figures 8.11(a) and (b) show the theoretical temperature response curve 
under the RF configuration after periodic pulse heating calculated from 
equation [8.37]. The time scale is normalized by the periodic pulse intervals, 
and the temperature scale is arbitrarily normalized. Figure 8.11(a) shows the 
temperature response curves when the heat diffusion times of the entire thin 
film are different with 𝛾= 1. When the thermal effusivity of the substrate is 
0, it corresponds to the heat insulation boundary condition of the thin film. 
The heat diffusion time 𝜏௙ is normalized by ∆𝑇, and a dimensionless 
parameter Φ = 𝜏௙/∆𝑇 is introduced. Figure 8.11(b) shows a different 
temperature response curve for different 𝛾 with Φ = 0.1.

8.4. Analysis of observed temperature response 
8.4.1. Picosecond pulsed light heating 
The Fourier coefficient 𝑌௡ was calculated by DFT from the 
thermoreflectance signal in the range of 0 seconds to 50 nanoseconds. 𝑌௡ is a 
complex number consisting of a real part and an imaginary part. Complex 
numbers can also be represented by absolute values and arguments. 
 
Figure 8.12. Magnitude of frequency components of  
thermoreflectance signal in Figure 8.5 (Baba et al. 2021) 
Figure 8.12 shows the absolute value of the Fourier coefficient |𝑌௡|. This 
plot can be thought of as a frequency response. Note that the Fourier 
coefficient shows symmetry with respect to the Nyquist rate 50 GHz. 
Since this sample is modeled as a semi-infinitely thick film on a 
substrate, as shown in Figure 8.9, the Laplace transform of the temperature 
response after single pulse heating is expressed by equation [8.24]. A curve 
fitting program using the nonlinear least squares method was used. The  
 

Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash Method     223 
 
regression analysis was applied only to the absolute value of the Fourier 
coefficient |𝑌௡| as follows: 
|𝑌௡| = |𝑌෨(𝜈௡, 𝑘෠′, 𝜏௙ෝ, 𝛾ො)| + 𝜀ᇱ  
[8.39] 
Figure 8.13 shows a regression curve in the frequency domain. As 
mentioned above, the curve fitting was done in the range less than the 
Nyquist rate. This time, the high- frequency component of 5 GHz or more is 
omitted. As shown in Figure 8.13, by fitting equation [8.29] to the absolute 
value of the Fourier coefficient, it was determined to be 𝜏௙ෝ at 6.47 ×
10ିଵ଴[s] and 𝛾ො at 0.676. The red curve in Figure 8.5 is the theoretical curve 
in the time domain derived from equation [8.36]. Note that by introducing 
three fitting parameters, the signal and theoretical curve observed over the 
iteration period match each other. 
 
Figure 8.13. Regression curve in frequency domain (Baba et al. 2021) 
Since the thickness of the platinum layer is 100 nanometers, the thermal 
diffusivity of the platinum thin film was calculated at 1.55× 10-5 m2s-1 by 
equation [8.35]. Taking the literature value of the specific heat capacity  
of platinum and the density as 𝑐௙= 133 [J/(kg ∙K)], the density as  
 

224     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 1 
 
𝜌௙= 21,500 [kg/mଷ] and the thermal effusivity of platinum as 11,240  
[J/(s଴.ହmଶK)], the fuzed quartz substrate 𝑏௦ was calculated as  
2,175 [J/(s଴.ହmଶK)]. 
8.4.2. Nanosecond pulsed light heating 
Since the observed temperature response for the TiN thin film of 680 nm 
thick measured by nanosecond pulse heating returns the original level in a 
much shorter time than the pulse duration period, an analytical equation after 
single pulse heating is applicable. Therefore, the black plot in Figure 8.7 was 
fitted by equation [8.25] and shown by the red curve in the figure. 
The observed heat diffusion time is 1.347×10-7 s, which agreed to the 
reference value of CRM “1.397×10-7 s” within 4%. The thermal diffusivity 
of the titanium nitride thin film was calculated as 3.4 × 10-6 m2s-1. 
8.5. Metrological standard and traceability for measurements of 
thin film thermophysical properties 
The pulsed light heating thermoreflectance method of front face 
heating/rear face detection (FR) configuration and rear face heating/front 
face detection (RF) configuration is an absolute measurement method  
under ideal measurement conditions. After systematic and comprehensive 
investigation, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 
Technology, National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) established a heat 
diffusion time standard for thin films (Yagi et al. 2008). All measuring 
instruments, such as the sampling period and electrical sensitivity of 
transient memory are traceable to the metrological standard. Measurement 
results are critically evaluated based on Guide to the Expression of 
Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). 
The heat diffusion time standard is provided by NMIJ, with a relative 
uncertainty of 8% for picosecond pulse heating and 5% for nanosecond pulse 
heating, expressed in expanded measurement uncertainty of coverage factor 
2. Based on these measurement standards, NMIJ provides thermal diffusivity 
reference material, which meets the requirements of a certified reference 
material quality management system (Yagi et al. 2008; Baba 2010; Baba  
et al. 2010). 

Thermal Diffusivity Measurement of Thin Films by Ultrafast Laser Flash Method     225 
 
As shown in Figure 8.14, the reliability of such thermophysical property 
data extends the concept of uncertainty evaluation and traceability for 
“measurement” to standard values for standard materials and standard data, 
and then to general thermophysical property data. It can be guaranteed by 
expanding to uncertainty assessment and guarantee of traceability (Baba  
et al. 2014). 
 
Figure 8.14. Generalization of uncertainty evaluation and  
traceability to from measurement to data (Baba et al. 2014) 
8.6. Application of measurement from industrial to basic physics 
The ultrafast laser flash method can measure a wide variety of thin films. 
If the optical properties of the thin film do not meet the requirements of the 
method, coating with a metallic thin film such as molybdenum is one 
solution (Baba 2009), then, semiconductors, carbon materials, oxide thin 
films, nitrides, carbides and polymers. 
Thin films developed for thermoelectric applications have been measured 
by the ultrafast laser flash method under both RF configuration and FF 
configuration (Kakefuda et al. 2017; Hinterleitner et al. 2019; Bourgès et al. 
2020; Gao et al. 2020; Latronico et al. 2021a, 2021b; Lima et al. 2021; Liu  
et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Lei et al. 2022; Peng et al. 2022; Van Hoang  
et al. 2022). Transparent conductive films for flat panel displays (Yagi et al. 
2005; Ashida et al. 2007, 2009; Oka et al. 2010), phase change materials for 
optical media and P-RAM (Kuwahara et al. 2006, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 
2009), and polymer thin films for organic electroluminescence (Oka et al.

2010b) have also been measured for example, showing the usefulness of this 
method. 
The ultrafast laser flash method has been applied to thermal diffusivity 
measurement under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell (Yagi et al. 2010), 
and also to thin films synthesized on a silicon substrate (Firoz et al. 2010). 
A focused beam system, for example, with a few microns spatial 
resolution in the in-plane dimension, has also been used to measure small 
crystals, or potentially site selective in-plane thermal conductivity 
measurements of inhomogeneous samples (Kakefuda et al. 2017; Piotrowski 
et al. 2018; Pawula et al. 2019). 
For the first time, heat transfer across a 100-nm thin metal thin film was 
observed down to the liquid helium temperature region, where the 
temperature response deviates from the heat diffusion equation (Nakamura  
et al. 2011). 
A highly reliable thermal design can be realized by simulation using the 
thermal diffusivity value of these highly reliable thin films and the boundary 
thermal resistance between the thin films measured by the ultrafast laser 
flash method. 
As described in this chapter, the ultrafast laser flash method has been 
developed to be a physically and mathematically rigorous method to 
measure and determine the thermal diffusivity of thin films. This is vital 
information for a wide variety of applications, as introduced above. The 
ultrafast laser flash method is also evolving and becoming more versatile by 
the day, and further advancements are eagerly awaited.
