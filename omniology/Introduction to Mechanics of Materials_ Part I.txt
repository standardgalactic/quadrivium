Preface
Preface
This book presents a basic introductory course to the mechanics of materials for students of mechanical 
engineering. It gives students a good background for developing their ability to analyse given problems 
using fundamental approaches. The necessary prerequisites are the knowledge of mathematical analysis, 
physics of materials and statics since the subject is the synthesis of the above mentioned courses. 
The book consists of six chapters and an appendix. Each chapter contains the fundamental theory and 
illustrative examples. At the end of each chapter the reader can find unsolved problems to practice their 
understanding of the discussed subject. The results of these problems are presented behind the unsolved 
problems.
Chapter 1 discusses the most important concepts of the mechanics of materials, the concept of stress. 
This concept is derived from the physics of materials. The nature and the properties of basic stresses, 
i.e. normal, shearing and bearing stresses; are presented too.
Chapter 2 deals with the stress and strain analyses of axially loaded members. The results are generalised 
into Hooke’s law. Saint-Venant’s principle explains the limits of applying this theory. 
In chapter 3 we present the basic theory for members subjected to torsion. Firstly we discuss the torsion 
of circular members and subsequently, the torsion of non-circular members is analysed.
In chapter 4, the largest chapter, presents the theory of beams. The theory is limited to a member with 
at least one plane of symmetry and the applied loads are acting in this plane. We analyse stresses and 
strains in these types of beams.
Chapter 5 continues the theory of beams, focusing mainly on the deflection analysis. There are two 
principal methods presented in this chapter: the integration method and Castigliano’s theorem.
Chapter 6 deals with the buckling of columns. In this chapter we introduce students to Euler’s theory in 
order to be able to solve problems of stability in columns.
In closing, we greatly appreciate the fruitful discussions between our colleagues, namely prof. Pavel 
Élesztős, Dr. Michal Čekan. And also we would like to thank our reviewers’ comments and suggestions.

Introduction – Concept of stress
1	 Introduction – Concept of stress
1.1	
Introduction
The main objective of the mechanics of materials is to provide engineers with the tools, methods and 
technologies for
• analysing existing load-bearing structures;
• designing new structures.
Both of the above mentioned tasks require the analyses of stresses and deformations. In this chapter we 
will firstly discuss the stress.

A Short Review of the Methods of Statics
 
Fig. 1.1
Let us consider a simple truss structure, see Fig. 1.1. This structure was originally designed to carry a 
load of 15kN. It consists of two rods; BC and CD. The rod CD has a circular cross-section with a 30-mm 
diameter and the rod BC has a rectangular cross-section with the dimensions 20×80 mm. Both rods are 
connected by a pin at point C and are supported by pins and brackets at points B and D. Our task is to 
analyse the rod CD to obtain the answer to the question: is rod CD sufficient to carry the load? To find 
the answer we are going to apply the methods of statics. Firstly, we determine the corresponding load 
acting on the rod CD. For this purpose we apply the joint method for calculating axial forces n each rod 
at joint C, see Fig. 1.2. Thus we have the following equilibrium equations

Solving the equations (1.1) we obtain the forces in each member: FBC = 20 kN ,FCD = 25 kN. The force FBC 
is compressive and the force FCD is tensile. At this moment we are not able to make the decision about 
the safety design of rod CD. 
Secondly, the safety of the rod BC depends mainly on the material used and its geometry. Therefore we 
need to make observations of processes inside of the material during loading.

Introduction – Concept of stress
Let us consider a crystalline mesh of rod material. By detaching two neighbour atoms from the crystalline 
mesh, we can make the following observation. The atoms are in an equilibrium state, see Fig. 1.3(a). Now 
we can pull out the right atom from its equilibrium position by applying external force, see Fig. 1.3(b).
The applied force is the action force. Due to Newton’s first law a reaction force is pulling back on the 
atom to the original equilibrium. During loading, the atoms find a new equilibrium state. The action 
and the reaction are in equilibrium too. If we remove the applied force, the atom will go back to its 
initial position, see Fig. 1.3(a). If we push the right atom towards the left atom, we will observe a similar 
situation; see Fig. 1.3(c). Now we can build the well-known diagram from the physics of materials: 
internal force versus interatomic distance, see Fig. 1.4. From this diagram we can find the magnitudes of 
forces in corresponding cases. Now we can extend our observation to our rod CD. For simplicity let us 
draw two parallel layers of atoms inside the rod considered, see Fig. 1.5. After applying the force of the 
external load on CD we will observe the elongation of the rod. In other words, the interatomic distance 
between two neighbouring atoms will increase. Then due to Newton’s first law the internal reaction 
forces will result between two neighbouring atoms. Subsequently the rod will reach a new equilibrium. 
Thus we can write:

equation (1.2) with the following one:

Introduction – Concept of stress
The resultant can be determined by applying the method of section. Passing the section at some arbitrary 
point Q we get two portions of the rod: CQ and DQ, see Fig. 1.6. Since force FCD = 25 kN must be applied 
at point Q for both portions to keep them in equilibrium, we can conclude that the resultant of internal 
forces of 100 kN is produced in the rod CD, when a load of 15kN is applied at C. 
Fig. 1.7
The above mentioned method of section is a very helpful tool for determining all internal forces. Let us 
now consider the arbitrary body subjected to a load. Dividing the body into two portions at an arbitrary 
point Q, see Fig. 1.7, we can define the positive outgoing normal ݊൅.the normal forceHܰሺݔሻis the force 
component in the direction of positive normal. The force component derived by turning the positive 
normal clockwise about ߨ
ʹ at Q is known as the shear force ܸሺݔሻ, the moment ܯሺݔሻ about the z-axis 
defines the bending moment (the positive orientation will be explain in Chapter 4). The moment ܶሺݔሻ 
defines the torque with a positive orientation according to the right-hand rule.

Introduction – Concept of stress
For assessing the safety of rod CD we need to ask material scientists for the experimental data about the 
materials response. When our rod is subjected to tension, we can obtain the experimental data from a 
simple tensile test. Let us arrange the following experiments for the rod made of the same material. The 
output variables are the applied force and the elongation of the rod, i.e. the force vs. elongation diagram. 
The first test is done for the rod of length L, and cross-sectional area A, see Fig 1.8 (a). The output can 
be plotted in Fig 1.8 (d), seen as curve number 1. For the second test we now define the rod to have 
a length of 2L while all other parameters remain, see Fig. 1.8 (b). The result is represented by curve 
number 2, see Fig. 1.8 (d). It is only natural that the total elongation is doubled for the same load level. 
For the third test we keep the length parameter L but increase the cross-sectional area to 2A. The result 
are represented by curve number 3, see Fig. 1.8 (d). The conclusion of these three experiments is that the 
load vs. elongation diagram is not as useful for designers as one would initially expect. The results are 
very sensitive to geometrical parameters of the samples. Therefore we need to exclude the geometrical 
sensitivity from experimental data.
1.3	
Definition of the Stresses in the Member of a Structure
The results of the proceeding section represent the first necessary step in the design or analysing of 
structures. They do not tell us whether the structure can support the load safely or not. We can determine 
the distribution functions of internal forces along each member. Applying the method of section we 
can determine the resultant of all elementary internal forces acting on this section, see Fig. 1.9. The 
average intensity of the elementary force ∆N over the elementary area ∆A is defined as ∆N/∆A. This 
ratio represents the internal force per unit area. Thus the intensity of internal force at any arbitrary point 
can be derived as

Introduction – Concept of stress
Whether or not the rod will break under the given load clearly depends upon the ability of the material 
to withstand the corresponding value, see the above mentioned definition, of the distributed internal 
forces. It is clear that this depends on the applied load ܨܥܦ, the cross-section area A and on the material 
of the rod considered.
The internal force per unit area, or the intensity of internal forces distributed over a given cross-sectional 
area, is called stress. The stress is denoted by the Greek letter sigma ߪ. The unit of stress is called the 
Pascal which has the value ܰ݉ʹ

sign of stress indicates compressive stress in a member or that the member is subjected to compression.
The equation (1.5) is not so convenient to use in engineering design so solving for this equation we get

Introduction – Concept of stress
If we apply Saint Venant’s principle, see Section 2.6 for more details, we can assume the uniform stress 
distribution function over the cross-section, except in the immediate vicinity of the loads points of 
application, thus we have

Fig. 1.10
A graphical representation is presented in Fig. 1.10. If an internal force N was obtained by the section 
passed perpendicular to the member axis, and the direction of the internal force N coincides with the 
member axis, then we are talking about axially loaded members. The direction of the internal force N also 
determines the direction of stress σ. Therefore we define this stress σ as the normal stress. Thus formula 
(1.7) determines the normal stress in the axially loaded member.
From elementary statics we get the resultant N of the internal forces, which then must be applied to 
the centre of the cross-section under the condition of uniformly distributed stress. This means that 
a uniform distribution of stress is possible only if the action line of the applied loads passes through the 
centre of the section considered, see Fig. 1.11. Sometimes we this type of loading is known as centric 
loading. In the case of an eccentrically loaded member, see Fig. 1.12, this condition is not satisfied, 
therefore the stress distribution function is not uniform. The explanation will be done in Chapter 4. 
The normal force ܰܥൌܨ and the moment ܯܥൌܨ݀ are the internal forces obtained through the 
method of section.

Basic Stresses (Axial, Normal, Shearing and Bearing stress)
 
Fig. 1.13
In the previous Section we discussed the case when the resultant of internal forces and the resulting stress 
normal to the cross-section are considered. Now let us consider the cutting process of material using 
scissors, see Fig. 1.13. The applied load F is transversal to the axis of the member. Therefore the load F 
is called the transversal load. Thus we have a physically different stress. Let us pass a section through 
point C between the application points of two forces, see Fig. 1.14 (a). Detaching portion DC form the 
member we will get the diagram of the portion DC shown in Fig. 1.14(b). The zero valued internal 
forces are excluded. The resultant of internal forces is only the shear force. It is placed perpendicular to 
the member axis in the section and is equal to the applied force. The corresponding stress is called the 
shearing stress denoted by the Greek letter tau τ. Now we can define the shearing stress as In comparison 
to the normal stress, we cannot assume that the shearing stress is uniform over the cross-section. The 
proof of this statement is explained in Chapter 4. Therefore we can only calculate the average value of 
shearing stress:

The presented case of cutting is known as the shear.
The cutaway effect can be commonly found in bolts, screws, pins and rivets used to connect various 
structural components, see Fig. 1.15(a).Two plates are subjected to the tensile force F. The corresponding 
cutting stress will develop in plane CD. Considering the method of section in plane CD, for the top 
portion of the rivet, see Fig. 1.15(b), we obtain the shearing stress according to formula (1.9)

Until now we have discussed the application of section in a perpendicular direction to the member axis.

point Q over an angle θ between the perpendicular section and this arbitrary section, we will get the 
free body diagram shown in Fig. 1.17. From the free body diagram we see that the applied force F is in 
equilibrium with the axial force P, i.e. P = F. This axial force P represents the resultant of internal forces 
acting in this section. The components of axial force are

Introduction – Concept of stress
Fittings, bolts, or screws have a lateral contact within the connected member, see Fig. 1.19. They create 
the stress in the connected member along the bearing surface or the contact surface. For example let 
us consider the bolt JK connecting two plates B and C, which are subjected to shear, see Fig. 1.19. The 
bolt shank exerts a force P on the plate B which is equal to the applied force F. The force P represents 
the resultant of all elementary forces distributed over the half of the cylindrical hole in plate B, see 
Fig. 1.20. The diameter of the cylindrical hole is D and the height is t. The distribution function of the 
aforementioned stresses is very complicated and therefore we usually use the average value of contact

Method of Problem Solution and Numerical Accuracy
Every formula previously mentioned and derived has its own validity. This validity predicts the application 
area, i.e. the limitations on the applicability. Our solution must be based on the fundamental principles of 
statics and mechanics of materials. Every step, which we apply in our approach, must be justified on this 
basis. After obtaining the results, they must be checked. If there is any doubt in the results obtained, we 
should check the problem formulation, the validity of applied methods, input data (material parameters, 
boundary conditions) and the accuracy of computations.
The method of problem solution is the step-by-step solution. This approach consists of the following steps:

Introduction – Concept of stress
For example it is possible that we can get inaccurate material parameters. Let us consider an error of 
5% in Young’s modulus. Then the calculation of stress contains at least the same error, the explanation 
can be found in Section 2.5. The accuracy of computation is tightly connected with the computational 
method applied. We can apply either the analytical solution or the iterative solution.

Components of Stress under General Loading Conditions
 
Fig. 1.23
Until now we have limited the discussion to axially loaded members. Let us generalise the results obtained 
in the previous sections. Thus we can consider a body subjected to several forces, see Fig. 1.23. To analyse 
the stress conditions created by the loads inside the body, we must apply the method of sections. Let us 
analyse stresses at an arbitrary point Q. The Euclidian space is defined by three perpendicular planes, 
therefore we will pass three parallel sections to the Euclidian ones through point Q.

Introduction – Concept of stress
Firstly we pass a section parallel to the principal plane yz, see Fig. 1.24 and take into account the left 
portion of the body. This portion is subjected to the applied forces and the resultants of all internal forces 
(these forces replace the effect of the removed part). In our case we have the normal force ܰݔ and the 
shear force ܸݔ. The lower subscript means the direction of the positive outgoing normal. The general 
shear force ܸݔ has two components in the directions of y and z, i.e. ܸݔ
ݕ and ܸݔݖ. The superscript indicates 
the direction of the shear component. For determining the stress distributions over the section we need 
to define a small area ∆A surrounding point Q, see Fig. 1.24. Then the corresponding internal forces are 
ȟܰݔǡ ȟܸݔ
ݕǡ ȟܸݔݖ. Recalling the mathematical definition of stress in equations (1.5) and (1.8), we get

These results are presented in Fig.1.25 Remember that the first subscript in ߪݔ, ߬ݔݕ and ߬ݔݖ is used to 
indicate that the stresses under consideration are exerted on a surface perpendicular to the x axis. The 
second subscript in the shearing stresses identifies the direction of the component. The same results 
will be obtained if we apply the same approach for the right side of the body considered, see Fig. 1.26.

Introduction – Concept of stress
Secondly we now pass a section parallel to the principal plane of xz, where we will get the stress 
components: ߪݕ, ߬ݕݔ and ߬ݕݖ in a similar way. Thirdly, passing a section parallel to the principal plane 
of xy, we can also get the stress components: ߪݖ, ߬ݖݔ and ߬ݖݕ by the same way. Thus the stress state 
at point Q is defined by nine stress components. With respect to statics, it is astatically indeterminate 
problem, since we only have six equilibrium equations.
 
Fig. 1.27
 
Fig. 1.28
To visualise the stress conditions at point Q, we can represent point Q as a small cube, see Fig. 1.27. 
There are only three faces of the cube visible in Fig. 1.27. The stresses on the hidden parallel faces are 
equal and opposite of the visible ones. Such a cube must satisfy the condition of equilibrium. Therefore 
we can multiply the stresses by the face area ∆A to obtain the forces acting on the cube faces. Focusing 
on the moment equation about the local  axis, see Fig. 1.28 and assuming the positive moment in the 
counter-clockwise direction, we have

The relation obtained shows that the y component of the shearing stress exerted on a face perpendicular 
to the x axis is equal to the x component of the shearing exerted on a face perpendicular to the y axis.

The equations (1.19) and (1.20) represent the shear law. The explanation of the shear law is: if the 
shearing stress exerts on any plane, then the shearing stress will also exert on the perpendicular 
plane to that one. Thus the stress state at any arbitrary point is determined by six stress components:

Design Considerations and Factor of Safety
In the previous sections we discussed the stress analysis of existing structures. In engineering applications 
we must design with safety as well as economical acceptability in mind. To reach this compromise stress 
analyses assists us in fulfilling this task. The design procedure consists of the following steps:

Introduction – Concept of stress
• Determination of the ultimate stress of a material. A certified laboratory will make material 
tests in respect to the defined load. For example they can determine the ultimate tensile 
stress, the ultimate compressive stress and the ultimate shearing stress for a given material, see 
Fig. 1.29.
• Allowable load and allowable stress, Factor of Safety. Due to any unforeseen loading during 
the structures operation, the maximum stress in the designed structure can not be equal to 
the ultimate stress. Usually the maximum stress is less than this ultimate stress. Low stress 
corresponds to the smaller loads. This smaller loading we call the allowable load or design 
load. The ratio of the ultimate load to the allowable load is used to define the Factor of Safety 
which is:
ܨܽܿݐ݋ݎ݋݂݂ܵܽ݁ݐݕൌܨǤ ܵǤ ൌ
ܷ݈ݐ݅݉ܽݐ݁݈݋ܽ݀
ܣ݈݈݋ݓܾ݈ܽ݁݈݋ܽ݀
(1.21)
An alternative of this definition can be applied to stresses:
ܨܽܿݐ݋ݎ݋݂݂ܵܽ݁ݐݕൌܨǤ ܵǤ ൌ
ܷ݈ݐ݅݉ܽݐ݁ݏݐݎ݁ݏݏ
ܣ݈݈݋ݓܾ݈ܽ݁ݏݐݎ݁ݏݏ
(1.22)
• Selecting the appropriate Factor of Safety. The appropriate Factor of Safety (F.S.) for a given 
design application requires good engineering judgment based on many considerations, such 
as the following:
--
Type of loading, i.e. static or dynamic or random loading.
--
Variation of material properties, i.e. composite structure of different materials.
--
Type of failure that is expected, i.e. brittle or ductile failure, etc.
--
Importance of a given member, i.e. less important members can be designed with 
allowed F.S.
--
Uncertainty due to the analysis method. Usually we use some simplifications in our 
analysis.
--
The nature of operation, i.e. taking into account the properties of our surrounding, for 
example: corrosion properties.
For the majority of structures, the recommended F.S. is specified by structural Standards and other 
documents written by engineering authorities.

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
2	 Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
2.1	
Introduction
In the previous chapter we discussed the stresses produced in the structures under various conditions, 
i.e. loading, boundary conditions. We have analyzed the stresses in simply loaded members and we 
learned how to design some characteristic dimensions of these members due to allowable stress. Another 
important aspect in the design and analysis of structures are their deformations, and the reasons are very 
simple. For example, large deformations in the structure as a result of the stress conditions under the 
applied load should be avoided. The design of a bridge can fulfil the condition for allowable stress but 
the deformation (in our case deflection) at mid-span may not be acceptable. The deformation analysis 
is very helpful in the stress determination too, mainly for statically indeterminated problems. Statically 
it is assumed that the structure is a composition of rigid bodies. But now we would like to analyse the 
structure as a deformable body.

Let us assume that the rod BC, of length L with constant cross-sectional area A, is hanging on a fixed 
point B, see Fig. 2.1 . If we apply the load F we can observe an elongation of the rod BC. Both the applied 
force and elongation can be measured. And we can plot the load vs. elongation, see Fig. 2.2. 
As we mentioned in the previous chapter, we would like to avoid plotting geometrical characteristics, 
i.e. cross-sectional area and length. We cannot use such a graph directly to predict the rod elongation 
of the same material with different dimensions. Let us consider the following examples:

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
The applied load F causes the elongation DL. The corresponding normal stress can be found by passing 
a section perpendicular to the axis of the rod (method of sections) applying this method we obtain 
Vݔൌ

Τ , see Fig. 2.1. If we apply the same load to the rod of length 2L and the same cross-
sectional area A, we will observe an elongation of 2DL with the same normal stress Vݔൌܨܣ
Τ , see 
Fig. 2.3. This means the deformation is twice as large as the previous case. But the ratio of deformation 
over the rod length is the same, i.e. is equal to DL/L. This result brings us to the concept of strain. 
We can now define the normal strain e caused by axial loading as the deformation per unit length of 
the rod. Since length and elongation have the same units, the normal strain is a dimensionless quantity. 
Mathematical, we can express the normal strain by:

Fig. 2.4
This equation is valid only for a rod with constant cross-sectional area. In the case of variable cross sectional 
area, the normal stress varies over the axis of the rod by ߪݔൌܨܣሺݔሻ
Τ
. Then we must define the normal 
strain at an arbitrary point Q by considering a small element of undeformed length Dx. The corresponding 
elongation of this element is D(DL), see Fig 2.4. Thus we can define the normal strain at point Q as:

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
As we discussed before, plotting load vs. elongation is not useful for engineers and designers due to 
their strong sensitivity on the sample geometry. Therefore we explained the concepts of stress and strain 
in Sec. 1.3 and Sec. 2.2 in detail. The result is a stress-strain diagram that represents the relationship 
between stress and strain. This diagram is an important characteristic of material and can be obtained 
by conducting a tensile test. The typical specimen can be shown in Fig. 2.5. The cross-sectional area 
of the cylindrical central portion of the specimen has been accurately determined and two gage marks 
have been made in this portion at a distance L0 from each other. The distance L0 is known as the gage 
length (or referential length) of the specimen. The specimen is then placed into the test machine seen in 
Fig. 2.6, which is used for centric load application. As the load F increases, the distance L between gage 
marks also increases. The distance can be measured by several mechanical gages and both quantities (load 
and distance) are recorded continuously as the load increases. As a result we obtain the total elongation 
of the cylindrical portion DL=L-L0 for each corresponding load step. From the measured quantities we 
can recalculate the values of stress and strain using equations (1.5) and (2.1). For different materials 
we obtain different stress-strain diagrams. In Fig. 2.7 one can see the typical diagrams for ductile and 
brittle materials.

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading

Fig. 2.7
For a more detailed discussion about the diagrams we recommend any book which is concerned with 
material sciences for engineers.
Many engineering applications undergo small deformations and small strains. Thus the response of 
material can be expected in an elastic region. For many engineering materials the elastic response is 
linear, i.e. the straight line portion in a stress-strain diagram. Therefore we can write:
ߪݔൌܧߝݔ
(2.3)
This equation is the well-known Hooke’s law, found by Robert Hooke (1635–1703), the English pioneer 
of applied mechanics. The coefficient E is called the modulus of elasticity for a given material, or 
Young’s modulus, named after the English scientist Thomas Young (1773–1829). Since the strain ε is a 
dimensionless quantity, then the modulus of elasticity E has the same units as the stress σ, in Pascals. The 
physical meaning of the modulus of elasticity is the stress occurring in a material undergoing a strain 
equal to one, i.e. the measured specimen is elongated from its initial length L0.
If the response of the material is independent from the direction of loading, it is known as isotropic. 
Materials whose properties depend upon the direction of loading are anisotropic. Typical example of 
anisotropic materials are laminates, composites etc.

It is natural to assume that normal stresses on the faces of a unit cube which represents the arbitrary point 
Q are zero. σy = σz = 0. This could convince one to assume that the corresponding strains εy, εz are zero too. 
But this is not our case. In many engineering materials the elongation in the direction of applied load is 
accompanied with a contraction in any transversal direction, see Fig. 2.9. We are assuming homogeneous 
and isotropic materials, i.e. mechanical properties are independent of position and direction. Therefore 
we have εy = εz. This common value is called the lateral strain. Now we can define the important material 
constant: Poisson’s ratio, named after Simeon Dennis Poisson (1781–1840), as:

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
Let us consider that our material is isotropic and homogeneous. Our arbitrary point Q is represented by 
a unit cube (where the dimensions of each side are a unit of the length), see Fig. 2.12. Under the given 
multiaxial loading the unit cube is deformed into a rectangular parallelepiped with the following sides: 
ሺͳ ൅ߝݔሻǡ ൫ͳ ൅ߝݕ൯ǡ ሺͳ ൅ߝݖሻ, where εx, εy, εz are strains in the directions of the coordinate axes seen in 
Fig. 2.12(b). It is necessary to emphasis that the unit cube is undergoing the deformation motion only 
with no rigid motion (translation). Then we can express the strain components εx, εy, εz in terms of the 
stress components σx, σy, σz. For this purpose, we will first consider the effect of each stress component 
separately. Secondly we will combine the effects of all contributing stress components by applying the 
principle of superposition. This principle states that the final effect of combined loading can be obtained 
by determining the effects for individual loads separately and subsequently these separate effects are 
combined into the final result.
In our case the strain components are caused by the stress component sx : in the x direction ߝݔ

in the y and z directions ߝݕ

generalized stress state defines with six stress components ߪݔǡ ߪݕǡ ߪݖǡ ߬ݔݕǡ ߬ݔݖǡ ߬ݕݖ, see Fig. 2.13. The 
shearing stresses ߬ݔݕǡ ߬ݔݖǡ ߬ݕݖ have no direct effect on normal strains, as long as the deformations remain 
small. In this case there is no effect on validity of equation (2.7). The occurrence of shearing stresses is 
clearly observable. Since the shearing stresses tend to deform the unit cube into a oblique parallelepiped.

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
 
Fig. 2.15
For simplicity, let us consider a unit cube of material which undergoes a simple shear in the xy plane, 
see Fig.2.14. The unit cube is deformed into the rhomboid with sides equal to one, see Fig. 2.15. In other 
words, shearing stresses cause the shape changes while normal stresses cause the volume changes. Let us 
focus on the angular changes. The four angles undergo a change in their values. Two of them reduced 
their values from ȫ
ʹ to ȫ
ʹ െߛݔݕ while the other two increase from ȫ
ʹ to 
ȫ
ʹ െߛݔݕ. This angular change  
ߛݔݕ (measured in radians) defines the shearing strain in both directions x and y. The shearing strain is 
positive if the reduced angle is formed by two faces with the same direction as the positive x and y axes, 
see Fig. 2.15. Otherwise it is negative.
In a similar way as the normal stress-strain diagram for tensile test we can obtain the shear stress-strain 
plot for simple shear or simple torsion, discussed in Chapter 3. From a mathematical point of view we 
can write Hooke’s law for the straight part of the diagram by:
߬ݔݕൌܩߛݔݕ
(2.8)
The material constant G is the shear modulus for any given material and has the similar physical meaning 
as Young’s modulus. 
If we consider shear in the xz and yz planes we will get similar solutions to Eq. (2.8) for stresses in those 
planes, i.e.
߬ݔݖൌܩߛݔݖ

Finally we can conclude that the generalised Hooke’s law or elasticity equations for the generalised stress 
state are written by:

The validity of these equations is limited to isotropic materials, the proportionality limit stress that can 
not be exceeded by none of the stresses, and the superposition principle. Equation (2.10) contains three

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
 
Fig. 2.17
Until now we have discussed axially loaded members (bars, rods) with uniformly distributed stress 
over the cross-section perpendicular to the axis of the member. This assumption can cause errors in the 
vicinity of load application. For simplicity let us consider a homogeneous rubber-like member that is 
axially loaded by a compressive force F, see Fig. 2.16. Let us make the following two experiments. Firstly, 
we draw a squared mesh over the member; see Fig. 2.17(a). Then we apply the compressive load through 
two rigid plates; see Fig. 2.17(b). The member is deformed in such a manner that it remains straight but 
the original square element change into a rectangular elements, see Fig. 2.17(b). The deformed mesh 
is uniform; therefore the strain distribution over a perpendicular cross-section is also uniform. If the 
strain is uniform, then we can conclude that the stress distribution is also similarly uniform described 
by Hooke’s law. Secondly we apply the compressive force to the same meshed member throughout the 
sharp points, see Fig. 2.18. This is the effect of a concentrated load. We can observe strong deformations 
in the vicinity of the load application point. At certain distances from the end of a member the mesh 
is again uniform and rectangular. Therefore we can say that there are large deformations and stresses 
around the load application point while uniform deformations and stresses occur farther from this point. 
In other words, except for the vicinity of load application point, the stress distribution function may be 
assumed independently to the load application mode. This statement which can be applicable to any 
type of loading is known as Saint-Venant’s principle, after Adhémar Barré de Saint-Venant (1797–1886).

While Saint-Venant’s principle makes it possible to replace actual loading with a simpler one for 
computational purposes, we need to keep in mind the following:
• The actual loading and loading used to compute stresses must be statically equivalent.
• Stresses cannot be computed in the vicinity of load application point. In these cases 
advanced theoretical and experimental method must be applied for stress determination.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
Now we can conclude that the application of this equation: Equation (2.15) may be used only if the rod 
is homogeneous (constant E), has a uniform cross-sectional area A, and is loaded at both ends. If the 
member is loaded at any other point or is composed from several different homogeneous parts having 
different cross-sectional areas we must apply the division into parts satisfying the previous conclusion.

In the case of variable cross-sectional area, as in Fig. 2.4, the strain depends on the position of the arbitrary 
point Q, therefore we must apply equation (2.2) for the strain computation. After some mathematical

Until now we could solve problems starting with the free body diagram, and subsequently determine the 
reactions from equilibrium equations. Recalling the method of sections in (chapter 2.2) we can compute 
internal forces at any arbitrary section, allowing us to then proceed with computing stresses, strains 
and deformations. But many engineering problems can not be solved by the approach of statics alone. 
 
Fig. 2.19
For simplicity, let us consider a simple problem, see Fig. 2.19. Using statics we cannot solve the problem 
through equilibrium equations. The main difficulty in this problem is that the number of unknown 
reactions is greater than the number of equilibrium equations. From a mathematical point of view the 
problem is ill-conditioning. For our case we obtain one equilibrium equation as

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
 
Fig. 2.21
To overcome the static indeterminacy we need to complete the system of equilibrium equations with 
relations involving deformations by considering the geometry of the problem. These additional relations 
are called deformation conditions. For practical solution let us consider the following transformation in 
Fig. 2.20. The problem presented is exactly the same as the problem in Fig. 2.19. This problem is statically 
indeterminate to the first degree. Removing the redundant support at point C and replacing it with the 
unknown reaction Rc we obtain the so-called statically indeterminate problem with unknown reaction, 
see Fig. 2.20(b). Now our task is to receive the same response for the statically indeterminate problem 
as in the original statically indeterminate problem. To get the same response of the structure we need 
to impose the deformation condition for point C, that the displacement for this point is equal to zero, 
see Fig. 2.21, or mathematically
 ൌͲ
(2.19)
This condition (2.19) coincides with the total elongation of the member also equal to zero. We then have:
 ൌȟ ൌͲ
(2.20)
The member presented in Fig. 2.21 can be divided into two homogeneous parts. Therefore the total 
elongation is a sum of individual elongation, equation (2.16), i.e. ȟ ൌȟͳ ൅ȟʹ. Then we have

Both normal forces ܰͳሺݔሻൌെܴܿǡ ܰʹሺݔሻൌܨെܴܥ are functions of unknown reaction RC. Solving

Problems Involving Temperature Changes
 
Fig. 2.22
In the previous discussions we assumed constant temperature as the member was being loaded. Let us 
now consider a homogeneous rod BC with the constant cross-sectional area A and the initial length 
L, see Fig. 2.22. If the temperature of the rod grows by ∆T then we will observe the elongation of the 
rod by ∆LT, see Fig. 2.22. This elongation is proportional to the temperature increase ∆T and the initial 
length L. Using basic physics we have

(2.22)
where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion. The thermal strain εT is associated with the aforementioned

Fig. 2.24
By modify the previous rod by placing it between two rigid plates and subjecting it to a temperature 
change of ∆T we will observe no elongation because of the fixed supports at its ends. We know that this 
problem is statically indeterminate due to the supports at each end. Let us then transform the problem 
into the so-called statically determinate problem. Removing the support at point C and replace it by 
unknown reaction RC. Now we can apply the principle of superposition in the following way. Firstly, 
we heat the rod by ∆T, see Fig. 2.24(a), then we can observe the elongation ȟ ൌߙሺȟሻ, see 
Fig. 2.24(b). Secondly, we push the rod by the reaction RC back to its initial length, see Fig. 2.24(c). The

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
Problem 2.4
 
Fig. 2.32
A bar BC and CG of length L is attached to rigid supports at B and G. Part BC have a square cross-section 
and between point C and G the cross section is circular. What are the stresses in portions BC and CG 
due to the application of load F at point C in Fig. 2.32. The weight of the bar is neglected. Design the 
parameter D to accommodate for the given allowable strss sAll. length L, modulus of elasticity E and 
applied force F are known. Problem is statically indeterminate.
Solution

Stress and Strain – Axial Loading
Solution
 
Fig. 2.36
Problem is statically indeterminate and for the solution we use the deformation condition at point B.
First step of solution is to substitute an unknown reaction at point B (see Fig. 2.36).
Because the problem is in pure tension, the reaction Ry and moment M are zero, reaction R is non-zero. 
Solution of this problem is divided into two parts.

Torsion
In the previous chapter we discussed axially loaded members and we analyzed the stresses and strains 
in these members, but we only considered the internal force directed along the axis of each member 
without observing any other internal force. Now we are going to analyse stresses and strains in members 
subjected to twisting couples or torques T and T`, see Fig. 3.1. Torques have a common magnitude and 
opposite sense and can be represented either by curved arrows or by couple vectors, see Fig. 3.2. 
 
Fig. 3.2 Alternative representations of torques
Members in torsion are encountered in many engineering applications and are primarily used to transmit 
power from one point to another. These shafts play important roles in the automotive and power industry. 
Some applications are presented in Fig. 3.3.
 
Fig. 3.3 Transmitting shafts, [http://www.directindustry.com]
There is a parallelism between an axially loaded member and a member in torsion. Both vectors of 
applied force ܨതand applied torque ܶത act in the direction of the member axes, see Fig. 3.4. Further on, 
will see the results of a deformation analysis speak more about this parallelism.

This chapter contains two different approaches in solving torsion problems. Firstly we will present the 
theory for members with circular cross-sectional areas (circular members in short) and secondly we will 
extend our knowledge of this theory for application on non-circular members.

Let us consider a circular shaft fixed to a support at point B while the other end is free, see Fig. 3.5. The 
shaft is of length L with constant circular cross-sectional area A. If the torque T is applied at point C 
(free end of shaft), then the shaft will twist, i.e. the free end will rotate about the shaft axis through the 
angle of twist φ and the shaft axis remains straight after applying the load. 
Before applying the load, we can draw a square mesh over the cylindrical surface of the shaft as well as 
varying diameters on the front circular surface of the shaft, see Fig. 3.6(a). After applying the load and 
under the assumption of a small angle of twist (less than 5°) we can observe the distortion in Fig. 3.6(b):
1.	 All surface lines on the cylindrical part rotate through the same angle γ.
2.	 The frontal cross-sections remain in the original plane and the shape of every circle remains 
undistorted as well.
3.	 Diameters on the front face remain straight.
4.	 The distances between concentric circles remain unchanged.

These experimental observations allow us to conclude the following hypotheses:
1.	 All cross-sectional areas remain in the original plane after deformation.
2.	 Diameters in all cross-sections remain straight.
3.	 The distances between any arbitrary cross-sections remain unchanged.
The acceptability of these hypotheses is proven by experimental results. The aforementioned hypotheses 
result in no strain along the member axis. Applying equation (2.5) for isotropic material, we get

Using equations of elasticity (2.10) we have ߪݔൌͲ. Equation (3.1) means that the edge dimensions of 
the unit cube are unchanged, but the shape of unit cube is changing. This can be proven with a small 
experiment. Let us imagine a circular member composed of two wooden plates which represent the faces 
on the front of the member. Now consider several wooden slats that are nailed to these plates and make 
up the cylindrical surface of the member, see Fig. 3.7. Let us make two markers on each neighbouring 
slat, see Fig. 3.7(a). These markers represent the top surface of the unit cube. After applying a load, the 
markers will slide relative to each other, see Fig. 3.7(b). The square configuration will then be deformed 
into a rhombus which proves the existence of a shearing strain.

We can now determine the shearing strain distribution in a circular shaft, see Fig. 3.5, and which has 
been twisted through the angle φ, see Fig. 3.8(a). Let us detach the inner cylinder of radius ߩǡ ߩא ۃͲǡ ܴۄ 
from the shaft. Now lets consider a small square element on its surface formed by two adjacent circles and 
two adjacent straight lines traced on the surface of the cylinder before any load is applied, see Fig. 3.8(b). 
Now subjecting the shaft to the torque T, the square element becomes deformed into a rhombus, see 
Fig. 3.8(c). Recalling that, in section 2.5, the angular change of element represents the shearing strain. 
This angular change must be measured in radians.
From Fig. 3.8(c) one can determine the length of arc ܧܧƮ using basic geometry: ܧܧƮ ൌܮߛRUܧܧƮ ൌߩ߮. 
Then we can derive

(3.2)
where γ, φ are both considered to be in radians. From equation (3.2) it is clear for a given point on the 
shaft that the shearing strain varies linearly with the distance ρ from the shaft axis. 
Due to the definition of inner radius ρ the shearing strain reaches its maximum on the outer surface of 
the shaft, where ρ = R. Then we get

Using equations (3.2) and (3.3) we can eliminate the angle of twist. Then we can express the shearing

Let us consider a section BC of the circular shaft with constant diameter D along its length L, subjected 
to torques T and T` at its ends, see Fig. 3.9. Applying the method of sections, we can divide the shaft into 
two arbitrary portions BQ and QC at any arbitrary point Q. In order to satisfy conditions of equilibrium 
for each part separately, we need to represent the removed part with internal forces. In our case, from 
the equilibrium equations, we get non-zero values only for the torque T(x), see Fig. 3.10(a). This 
torque represents the resultant of all elementary shearing forces dF exerted on a section at point Q, see  
Fig. 3.10 (b). If the portion BQ is twisted, we can write
׬ ߩ݀ܨൌܶሺݔሻ
(3.5)
where ρ is the perpendicular distance from the force dF to the shaft axis. The shearing force dF can be

This equation shows that the shearing stress also varies linearly with the distance ρ from the shaft axis, 
as long as the yield stress is not exceeded. The distribution functions of shearing stress are presented in 
Fig. 3.11(a), for a solid circle, and in Fig. 3.11(b) for a hollow circle (ρ ϵۃܴͳǡ ܴʹۄ). For the latter case we

Angle of Twist in the Elastic Region
 
Fig. 3.12
When observing the deformation of a circular shaft subjected to a torque T, see Fig. 3.12, we can see 
the rotation of the free end C, about the shafts axis or angle of twist φ. The entire shaft remains in the 
elastic region after applying the load. The considered shaft has a constant, circular cross-section with a 
maximum radius R, and a length of L. Now we can recall equation (3.3) where the maximum shearing 
strain ߛ݉ܽݔ and the angle of twist are related by the following
ߛ݉ܽݔൌ

We are assuming that there is elastic response, therefore we can apply Hooke’s law for simple shear

The obtained formula shows that the angle of twist is proportional to the applied torque within the elastic

parallelism: ȟܮ؜ ߮ǡܰሺݔሻ؜ ܶሺݔሻǡܧ؜ ܩǡܣ؜ ܬ. This equation is valid only if the shaft is made of 
homogenous material (constant G), has a uniform cross-sectional area (constant J), and is loaded at its ends.
If the shaft is composed from several different parts, each individually satisfying the validity of equation 
(3.16), we can extend formula (3.16) using the principles of superposition as follows:

In the case of variable cross-sectional area along the shaft, as in Fig.3.12, the strain depends on the

of the shearing strain. After some mathematical manipulation the total angle of twist of the member is

Fig. 3.13
Until now, we have discussed statically determinate problems. But there are some situations, where the 
internal torques can not be determinated using statics alone. For simplicity, let us consider a simple 
problem, see Fig. 3.13. In this case we cannot solve the problem through equilibrium equations from 
statics alone. The main difficulty in this problem is that the number of unknown reactions is greater than 
the number of equilibrium equations. From a mathematical point of view, the problem is ill-conditioned. 
For our case we obtain one equilibrium equation to be

This problem is statically indeterminate. To overcome this difficulty we must use the same approach as 
in Chapter 2, Section 2.7 , i.e. to add deformation conditions. In our case the angle of twist at point C 
is equal to zero, and corresponds to the total angle of twist

Design of Transmission Shafts
In designing transmission shafts the principal specifications that must be satisfied are the power to be 
transmitted and the velocity of rotation. Our task now is to select the material and the type and the size 
of cross-section to satisfy the strength condition, i.e. the maximum shearing stress will not exceed the 
allowable shearing stress ߬݉ܽݔ൑߬ܣ݈݈, when the shaft is transmitting the required power at the specified 
velocity. Recalling elementary physics we have
ܲൌܶ߱ൌʹߨ݂ܶ
 (3.21)
Where P is the transmitted power, w is the angular velocity, and f is the frequency of rotation. Solving 
equation (3.21) for T obtains the torque exerted on our shaft which is transmitting the required power 
P at a frequency of rotation f,

All previous formulas have been derived upon the axisymmetry of deformed members. Let us now 
consider the shaft with square cross-section, see Fig. 3.14. Experimental results show that the cross-
section of this type warped out of their original plane. Therefore we cannot apply relations which are 
otherwise valid for circular members. For example, for a circular shaft the shearing stress varies linearly 
along the distance from the axis. Therefore, one could expect that the maximum stresses are at the 
corners of the square cross-sections but they are actually equal to zero. For this reason, we can consider 
a torsionally loaded bar, with an arbitrary non-circular cross-section, see Fig. 3.15. The shearing stress 
acts in an arbitrary direction on the contour of the cross-section. This stress τ has two components: 
a normal component τn and the tangential component τt. Due to the shear law, component τ'n must 
exist. But there is no load in that direction and therefore this stress is equal to zero and subsequently  
τn = τ'n = 0. The result means that in the vicinity of contour, the shearing stress is in the direction of 
tangent to the contour.

Now let us consider a small unit cube at the corner of a square cross-section, see Fig. 3.16(a). The corner 
is the intersection point of two contour lines. Therefore at the corner we have two tangential components 
τxy and τxz, see Fig. 3.16(b). According to the shear law, other shearing components, τyx and τzx, must exist .  
Both are on the free surface, and there is no load in the x-axis direction. We can then write

Let us imagine a small experiment, let’s twist a bar with square cross-section and made of a rubber-like 
material. We can verify very easily, that there are no stresses and deformations along the edges of the 
bar and the largest deformations and stresses are along the centrelines of the bars faces.

Applying the methods of mathematical theory of elasticity for the bar with rectangular cross-section

zero. We can find the two local stresses which are largest at point I and II (Roman numerals). Denoting 
L as the length of the bar, b and h as the narrow and wide side of bar cross-section respectively and T 
as the applied torque, see Fig. 3.18, we have

The stress distribution function over the non-circular cross-section can be visualised by the membrane 
analogy. Firstly, what does this analogy mean? Two processes are analogous if both can be describe by the 
same type of equations. In our case we have the twisting of a non-circular bar and the deformation of a 
thin membrane subjected to internal pressures, see Fig. 3.19. Both processes are determined by the same 
type of differential equations. Secondly, we need to determine the analogous variables. In our case we have

The graphical representation of these equations is presented in Fig. 3.20.
The membrane analogy can be efficiently applied for members whose cross-section can be unrolled into 
the basic rectangle bxh, see Fig. 3.21. Another application of the membrane analogy is for members with 
cross-sections composed from several rectangles, see Fig. 3.22. These cross-sections cannot be unrolled 
into one simple rectangle bxh. For this case we can assume that the total volume of deformed membrane 
is equal to the sum of individually deformed membranes, see Fig. 3.23. If the torque is analogous to the 
membrane volume, and then we can write

Let us consider the thin-walled hollow member of non-circular cross-section, see Fig. 3.24. The wall 
thickness varies within the transverse section and remains very small in comparison to other dimensions. 
Let us detach a small coloured portion DE. This portion is bounded by two parallel transverse sections 
by the distance ∆x and two parallel longitudinal planes. Focusing on the equilibrium of part DE in the 
longitudinal direction x, the shear law says that the shear forces ܨܦǡ ܨܧ are exerted on faces D and E, 
see Fig. 3.25. We then get the corresponding equation 
σ ܨݔൌͲ ׷ܨܦെܨܧൌͲ
(3.34)
The longitudinal shear forces ܨܦǡ ܨܧ are acting on the small faces of areas ȟݔݐܦDQGȟݔݐܧ. Thus we 
can express the force as a product of shearing stress and area, i.e.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

Considering the moment of inertia Iz of an area A with respect to an arbitrary z axis (Fig. A.13). Let us 
now draw the centroidal z’ axis, i.e., the axis parallel to the z axis which passes though the area’s centroid 
C. Denoting the distance between the element dA and axis passes though the centroid Cby y’, we write 
y = y’ + d. Substituting for y in Eq. (A.6), we write

The first step of the solution is to locate the centroid C of the area. However, this has already been done 
in Example A.02 for a given area A.
We divide the area A into two rectangular areas A1 and A2 (Fig. A.15) and compute the moment of

in which each element of area dA is multiplied by the product of its coordinates and integration is 
extended over the entire area A of a plane figure. If a cross-section area has an axis of symmetry which 
is taken for the y or z axis (Fig. A.19), the product of inertia is equal to zero. In the general case, for 
any point of any cross-section area, we can always find two perpendicular axes such that the product 
of inertia for these vanishes. If this quantity becomes zero, the axes in these directions are called the 
principal axes. Usually the centroid is taken as the origin of coordinates and the corresponding principal 
axes are then called the centroidal principal axes.

rod is subjected to a slowly increasing axial load F at C (Fig. A.20). The work done by the load F as it is 
slowly applied to the rod must result in the increase of some energy associated with the deformation of

Example A.09
Fig. A.23
Determine the strain energy in the cantilever beam due to shear if the beam has a rectangular cross-
section and is subject to a load F, Fig. A.23. assume that EI and G are constant.
Solution
From the free body diagram of the arbitrary section, we have
V(x) = F.
Since the cross-section is rectangular, the form factor

Using the results of Example A.08, with A = b h,

It can be seen that the result of this ratio will increasing as L decreases. However, even for short beams, 
where, say L = 5 h, the contribution due to shear strain energy is only 3.6% of the bending strain energy. 
For this reason, the shear strain energy stored in beams is usually neglected in engineering analysis.
