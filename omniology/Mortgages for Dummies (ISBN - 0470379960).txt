Praise for Eric Tyson’s national best-
selling personal finance guides:
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty 
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the 
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
 
— National Public Radio’s Sound Money
“Smart advice for dummies . . . skip the tomes . . . and buy Personal Finance 
For Dummies, which rewards your candor with advice and comfort.”
 
— Newsweek
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at 
all income levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a 
natural outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like 
Henry Ford, he wants to make something that was previously accessible 
only to the wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
 
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller 
Built to Last; Lecturer in Business, Stanford Graduate 
School of Business
“You don’t have to be a novice to like Mutual Funds For Dummies. Despite 
the book’s chatty, informal style, author Eric Tyson clearly has a mas-
tery of his subject. He knows mutual funds, and he knows how to explain 
them in simple English.”
 
— Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a For Dummies book. He 
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the 
why’s and how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English.”
 
— Chicago Tribune
“Worth getting. Scores of all-purpose money-management books reach 
bookstores every year, but only once every couple of years does a stand-
out personal finance primer come along. Personal Finance For Dummies, 
by financial counselor and columnist Eric Tyson, provides detailed, 
action-oriented advice on everyday financial questions. . . . Tyson’s style 
is readable and unintimidating.”
 
— Kristin Davis, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine
“For those named in the title, such as myself, Personal Finance For 
Dummies is a godsend. It’s bright, funny, and it can save you money, too.”
 
— Los Angeles Times

About the Authors
Eric Tyson is a syndicated personal finance writer, lecturer, and counselor. 
He is dedicated to teaching people to manage their personal finances better. 
Eric is a former management consultant to Fortune 500 financial service 
firms. For more than 25 years he has successfully invested in securities as 
well as in real estate, and has started and managed several businesses. He 
holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Yale and an MBA from the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of five 
other national bestsellers in the For Dummies series: Home Buying (coauthor), 
Personal Finance, Investing, Mutual Funds, and Taxes (coauthor). His work has 
been featured and praised in hundreds of national and local publications, 
including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s, The Wall Street Journal, Money, Los Angeles 
Times, Chicago Tribune, and on Fox, NBC’s Today Show, PBS’s Nightly Business 
Report, CNN, The Oprah Winfrey Show, ABC, CNBC, Bloomberg Business Radio, 
CBS National Radio, and National Public Radio.
Eric has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of personal finance, 
investment, real estate, and mortgage quandaries and questions. In addition 
to maintaining a financial counseling practice, he is a popular speaker on 
important personal finance topics.
Ray Brown, coauthor of the national bestseller Home Buying For Dummies, is 
a veteran real estate broker with over three decades of hands-on experience. 
A former vice president and manager for Coldwell Banker Residential 
Brokerage Company and McGuire Real Estate, and founder of his own real 
estate firm, the Raymond Brown Company, Ray is currently a writer, radio 
talk show host, and public speaker on residential real estate topics.
Ray believes that most people are pretty darn smart. When they have 
problems, it’s usually because they don’t know the right questions to ask to 
get the information they need to make good decisions. This book completes 
Ray’s residential real estate trilogy and fulfills his dream of helping folks 
find their way through the often mystifying process of buying, financing, 
and selling their homes.
On his way to becoming a real estate guru, Ray worked as the real estate 
analyst for KGO-TV (ABC’s affiliate in San Francisco) and was a syndicated 
real estate columnist for The San Francisco Examiner. For 16 years he 
hosted a weekly radio program, Ray Brown on Real Estate, for KNBR. In 
addition to his work for ABC, Ray has appeared as a real estate expert on 
CNN, NBC, CBS, and in The Wall Street Journal and Time.
Ray’s most important accomplishments, however, remain Jeff and Jared, his 
incomparable sons, and 43 years of nearly always wedded bliss to the always 

wonderful Annie B. Last, but far from least, he’s delighted that Jeff’s wife, 
Genevieve, and his grandson, Aidan Joseph Brown, have joined the family.

Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as 
well as to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught 
me everything I know about how to explain financial terms and strategies so 
that all of us may benefit.
 —Eric Tyson
This book is lovingly dedicated to Annie B., who’s too marvelous for words. 
Still. 
—Ray Brown
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We offer our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the many good people at 
Wiley, including Mike Baker for wanting to keep this book current and the 
best, Chad Sievers for his fine project management skills, and Sarah Faulkner 
for her helpful editing suggestions.
We also wish to express our deepest thanks and appreciation to our friend 
and colleague Ken Scholen, Director of AARP’s Reverse Mortgage Education 
Project for his invaluable help with the reverse mortgage chapter. Craig 
Watts deserves equally high accolades for the fountainhead of facts and 
figures he graciously contributed to the credit scoring chapter. We owe an 
enormous debt of gratitude to our brilliant technical reviewer, Dennis Hart, 
an extraordinary mortgage professional who toiled long hours to ensure 
that what we wrote was actual and factual. Dennis was most ably aided and 
abetted by Vicky Jones and Shannon Furr. Nor can we forget Chris Bruno, 
who provided additional expertise for which we are eternally grateful.
Ray also thanks Ray Britton, Dennis Hart, Esty Lawrie, and Russ Marinello, four 
exceedingly street-smart lenders who graciously taught him 99.724 percent of 
what he knows about the practicalities of getting loans approved. It would be 
wrong not to give huge thanks to Ray’s pal, Jim Fabris, for 30 years of wise 
counsel and unwavering support.

Introduction
W
elcome to Mortgages For Dummies, 3rd Edition! What you hold in your 
hands is a completely revised edition. Not content to rest on our 
laurels, we’ve added lots of great tips and included an entirely new chapter 
about foreclosures.
If you own or want to own real estate, you need to understand mortgages. 
Whether you need a loan to buy your first home, want to refinance an existing 
mortgage, or are interested in tapping some of the value you’ve built up in your 
home over the years, you’ve found the right book.
Unfortunately for most of us, the mortgage field is jammed with jargon 
and fraught with fiscal pitfalls. Choose the wrong mortgage and you could 
end up squandering money better saved for important financial goals 
such as higher education for your adorable little gremlins or your very 
own retirement. In the worst cases, you could end up losing your home to 
foreclosure and in personal bankruptcy. Just look at what happened in the 
late 2000s when the real estate market declined in many parts of the 
country. Folks who overextended themselves with risky mortgages, which 
we strongly argue against in prior editions of this book, ended up in 
foreclosure.
For typical homeowners, the monthly mortgage payment is either their 
largest or, after income taxes, second largest expense item. When you’re 
shopping for a mortgage, you could easily waste many hours and suffer 
financial losses by not getting the best loan that you can.
Because so much is at stake, we want to help you make the best decisions 
possible. That’s where we come in.

Mortgages For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
The Eric Tyson/Ray Brown Difference
How is this book, you ask, different and better than competing mortgage 
books? Let us count the ways. Our book is:
 
 Objective: Our goal is to make you as knowledgeable as possible before 
you commit to a particular mortgage. Most mortgage books are written 
by mortgage brokers or lenders who loathe to share the secrets of the 
mortgage business. Typically, they’re more interested in promoting their 
own business by convincing you to use a particular mortgage broker or 
lender. We’re not here to promote any specific brokers or lenders — we 
wrote this book to help you.
 
 Holistic: When you obtain a mortgage, that decision affects your ability to 
save money and accomplish other important financial goals. We help 
you understand how best to fit your mortgage into the rest of your 
personal-finance puzzle. Other mortgage books don’t help you consider 
these bigger-picture issues of personal finance before you buy.
 
 Jargon-free: One of the hallmarks of books intended to confuse and 
impress the reader, rather than to convey practical information and 
advice, is the use of all sorts of insider terms that make things sound more 
mysterious and complicated than they really are. We, on the other hand, 
pride ourselves on simplifying the complex. Between the two of us, we 
have more than six decades of practical experience explaining things to 
real people just like you. Eric has worked as a financial counselor, teacher, 
and syndicated columnist. Ray hosted a residential real estate radio 
program for more than 15 years, managed several large residential real 
estate offices, and does real estate consulting. Our combined experience 
can put you firmly in control of the mortgage-decision-making process.
 
 User-friendly: You can read our book piecemeal to address your specific 
questions and immediate concerns. But if you want a crash course on 
the world of mortgages, read it cover to cover. In addition to being 
organized to help you quickly find the information you’re seeking, each 
portion of the book stands on its own.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make reading this book as easy as possible, we use the following 
conventions:
 
 We italicize new terms and give you a definition for them.
 
 Boldfaced text is applied to keywords in bulleted lists and the action 
part of numbered lists.

 Introduction
 
 All Web sites and e-mail addresses are printed in monofont text. And 
if a Web site address breaks across two lines, we don’t include an extra 
hyphen at the end of the first line; just type it in exactly the way you see 
it (pretending the break doesn’t exist).
 
 We refer to the decade from 2000 to 2009 as the 2000s. Just wanted to 
avoid any confusion in case you were thinking of the year 2095.
What You’re Not to Read
Although reading every word of this book can help you secure the best mortgage 
for your needs, we understand that you may not have the time or the inclination 
to read it all. If you’re short on time, use the table of contents or index to look up 
whatever’s most relevant for you. Feel free to skip sidebars (those gray shaded 
boxes) and text marked with the Technical Stuff icon; we include interesting info 
in both places, but your overall understanding of the topic at hand won’t be in 
jeopardy if you pass them by.
Foolish Assumptions
Yes, we know that making assumptions is foolish, but we just can’t help 
ourselves. We assume that you, dear reader, fit into one of these categories:
 
 You’re preparing to purchase your first home.
 
 You want to refinance your current mortgage.
 
 You’re interested in tapping into the equity you’ve built up in your 
home.
How This Book Is Organized
Whether you’re a first-time homebuyer who needs to secure a mortgage or a 
long-time homeowner who is considering refinancing an existing mortgage, 
we’ve got you covered. We also thoughtfully include an entire chapter about 
home equity conversion plans (so-called reverse mortgages) for qualifying 
homeowners who want to convert part of their home’s equity into cash 
without having to move or repay a loan each month.

Mortgages For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances
Before you begin filling out any mortgage application forms or pick up the 
phone in search of the best deal, you should understand your overall financial 
situation. In this part, we assist you in taking a holistic view of your personal 
financial status to help you assess how much you can realistically borrow 
given your current expenses and financial goals. If, like many homeowners, 
you don’t have a good handle on these things, we show you how to get a firm 
grasp. We also help you understand how lenders evaluate your mortgage 
application and how you can stack the odds in your favor of obtaining the right 
mortgage, on time and at the best rates in town. Fear not if your credit score is 
a tad less than perfect. We demystify credit scoring and reveal techniques you 
can use to improve your credit score and lower your mortgage’s interest rate.
Part II: Locating a Loan
The next step in the mortgage shopping process is clarifying what type of loan 
best fits your situation — fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, hybrid, 15-year, 30-year, 
home equity, bridge, conforming, or jumbo. It all adds up to a gargantuan 
headache if you don’t understand the terminology and which loans and 
options are best for you. Because of all the bells and whistles on loans today, 
you can choose from literally hundreds of different loan options. Don’t be 
overwhelmed! In this part, we help you cut through the clutter and mortgage 
business jargon to select the loan that’s right for you.
Part III: Landing a Lender
In this part, we explain the heart of the mortgage shopping process — 
interviewing prospective lenders and understanding their myriad ways of 
charging you money. First, we help you discern what makes one lender or 
mortgage better than the rest. Then, we cover how you can network to find 
the best lender for the type of loan you need. We provide interview questions 
to help you separate the best from the rest. Next we expose the do’s and 
don’ts of using your computer to scour the Internet for a mortgage. To make 
sure that you shop intelligently, we have a loan comparison worksheet that 
quantifies information (points, fees, prepayment penalties, private mortgage 
insurance [PMI], rate locks, and more) you get about various loan programs, 
so you can identify the best loan for you. Last but not least, we offer helpful 
tips and perspective on completing the various forms you’ll need to polish off 
to get the mortgage of your dreams.

 Introduction
Part IV: Refinancing and Other Money 
Generators
Just because you buy a home and take out a mortgage doesn’t mean that 
you can simply forget about the world of mortgages. To the contrary — 
remember that change is the only constant! Your personal circumstances 
will change. Ditto mortgage rates. If rates drop, you should be positioned to 
reap the benefits by refinancing. The decision about whether to refinance 
and, if you decide to, what type of loan you’ll get, can be as complicated 
as the one to secure the mortgage you got when you bought your home. In 
addition to choosing a specific loan, you’ll also have to crunch some 
numbers to see whether you’ll save enough money to make refinancing 
worth your while. Don’t worry, we help you with the math. And, if you’re 
retired or nearing retirement, we also explain reverse mortgages, which you 
can use to make your golden years even more golden.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Tucked away in this part are some additional prizes you didn’t even know 
you wanted! In this part, we cover such useful topics as ten things you need 
to know about foreclosure, ten things you absolutely must avoid doing when 
getting a mortgage, and ten tips for saving tax dollars and determining when 
and whether to accelerate the paying off of your mortgage.
Part VI: Appendixes
Want to figure out what your monthly loan payment will be or how much 
you’ll still owe on your mortgage a few months or years after you got it? Are 
you stumped by the meaning of a particular mortgage term? Well, you’ve 
come to the right place! In the appendixes, you can find answers to all these 
questions and more.

K
en was a homeowner who was induced by an advertisement to refinance. 
He switched adjustable-rate mortgages without understanding how long 
it would take him to recoup the associated financing costs (nearly 10 years, 
which was longer than Ken intended to keep his home).
The main reason Ken refinanced was that his previous adjustable-rate loan’s 
interest rate increased rapidly when the adjustment index it was tied to rose 
sharply. Ken switched out of a faster moving loan after rates popped up, and 
he wasn’t able to benefit nearly as fast when rates fell.
Mary was a first-time homebuyer. She began going to open houses on 
Sunday afternoons and, in a relatively short time, fell in love with a home. 
Unfortunately, she had to mortgage herself up to her eyeballs to get into it.
Not thrilled with her job, Mary continued to tough it out because she had that 
hefty mortgage to feed every month. She had to cut out travel and restaurant 
dinners with friends. Mary was miserable. To cheer herself up, she started 
charging more on her credit card. The spending hangover that hit when her 
next credit card statement arrived made the enjoyment short-lived.
Now, trust us when we say that Ken and Mary aren’t stupid. However, when it 
came to making important mortgage decisions, Ken and Mary were certainly 
not well informed. Mary didn’t understand what amount of mortgage debt she 
could truly afford. Ken didn’t understand how to make refinancing decisions.

Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
In this chapter, we help you tackle the first vital subject to consider when 
the time comes to take out a mortgage — how much mortgage can you really 
afford? Note: We intend this chapter primarily to help people who are buying a 
home (first or not) determine what size mortgage fits their financial situation. 
If you’re in the mortgage market for purposes of refinancing, please also see 
Chapter 11.
Only You Can Determine the Mortgage 
Debt You Can Afford
Sit down and talk in person or by phone, or use a Web site to gather 
information and then meet face to face with any mortgage lender, mortgage 
broker, and you’ll be asked about your income and debts. Assuming you 
have a good credit history and an adequate cash down payment, the lender 
can quickly estimate the amount of mortgage debt you can obtain.
Suppose a mortgage lender says that you qualify to borrow, for example, 
$200,000. In this case, the lender is basically telling you that, based on the 
assessment of your financial situation, $200,000 is the maximum amount that 
this lender thinks you can borrow on a mortgage before putting yourself at 
significantly increased risk of default. Don’t assume that the lender is saying 
that you can afford to carry that much mortgage debt given your other 
financial goals.
Your personal financial situation — most of which lenders, mortgage brokers, 
and real estate agents won’t inquire into or care about — should help direct 
how much you borrow. For example, have you considered and planned for 
your retirement goals? Do you know how much you’re spending per month 
now and how much slack, if any, you have for additional housing expenses 
including a larger mortgage? How are you going to pay for college expenses 
for your kids?
Scrutinize Your Monthly Spending
Unless you have generous parents, grandparents, or in-laws, if you want to 
buy a home, you need to save money. The same may be true if you desire 
to trade up to a more costly property. In either case, you can find yourself 
taking on more mortgage debt than you ever dreamed possible.

11
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
After you trade up or buy your first home, your total monthly housing 
expenditures and housing-related spending (such as furniture) will surely 
increase. So, be forewarned that if you had trouble saving before the 
purchase, your finances are truly going to be squeezed after the purchase. 
This pinch will further handicap your ability to accomplish other important 
financial goals, such as saving for retirement, starting your own business, 
or helping to pay for your children’s college education.
Because you can’t manage the unknown, the first step in assessing your 
ability to afford a given mortgage amount is to collect and analyze your 
monthly spending. If you already track such data — whether by pencil and 
paper or on your computer — you have a head start. But don’t think you’re 
finished. Having your spending data is only half the battle. You also need to 
know how to analyze your spending data (which we explain how to do in this 
chapter) to help decide how much you can completely afford to borrow.
Collect Your Spending Data
What could be more dreadful than sitting at home on a beautiful sunny day — or 
staying in at night while your friends and family are out frolicking on the town — 
and cozying up to your calculator, checkbook register, credit card bills, pay stub, 
and most recent tax return?
Examining where and how much you spend on various items is almost no 
one’s definition of a good time (except, perhaps, for some accountants, 
actuaries, and other bean counters who crunch numbers for a living). 
However, if you don’t endure some pain and discomfort now, you could end 
up suffering long-term pain and discomfort when you get in over your head 
with a mortgage you can’t afford.
Now some good news: You don’t need to detail to the penny where your 
money goes. What you’re interested in here is capturing the bulk of your 
expenditures. Ideally, you should collect spending data for a three- to six-
month period to determine how much you spend in a typical month on 
taxes, clothing, meals out, and so forth. If your expenditures fluctuate greatly 
throughout the year, you may need to examine a full 12 months of your 
spending to obtain an accurate monthly average.
Later in this chapter, we provide a handy table that you can use to categorize 
your spending. First, however, we need to talk you through the specific and 
often large expenses of owning a home so that you can intelligently plug those 
into your current budget.

12
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Determine Your Potential 
Homeownership Expenses
If you’re in the market to buy your first home, you probably don’t have a 
clear sense about the costs of homeownership. Even people who presently 
own a home and are considering trading up often don’t have a good handle 
on their current or likely future homeownership expenses. So we include this 
section to help you assess your likely homeownership costs.
Making your mortgage payments
A mortgage is a loan you take out to finance the purchase of a home. Mortgage 
loans are generally paid in monthly installments over either a 15- or 30-year 
time span. Chapter 4 provides greater detail about how mortgages work.
In the early years of repaying your mortgage, nearly all of your mortgage 
payment goes toward paying interest on the money that you borrowed. Not 
until the later years of your mortgage do you rapidly begin to pay down your 
loan balance (the principal).
As we say earlier in this chapter, all that mortgage lenders can do is tell you 
their own criteria for approving and denying mortgage applications and 
calculating the maximum that you’re eligible to borrow. A mortgage lender 
tallies up your monthly housing expense, the components of which the lender 
considers to be the mortgage payment, property taxes, and homeowners 
insurance.
Understanding lenders’ ratios
For a given property that you’re considering buying, a mortgage lender 
calculates the housing expense and normally requires that it not exceed 
40 percent or so of your monthly before-tax (gross) income. So, for example, 
if your monthly gross income is $6,000, your lender may not allow your 
expected monthly housing expense to exceed $2,400. If you’re self-
employed and complete IRS Form 1040, Schedule C, mortgage lenders use 
your after-expenses (net) income, from the bottom line of Schedule C (and, 
in fact, add back noncash expenses for items such as depreciation, which 
increases a self-employed person’s net income for qualification purposes).
This housing expense ratio completely ignores almost all your other financial 
goals, needs, and obligations. It also ignores property maintenance and remodel-
ing expenses, which can suck up a lot of a homeowner’s dough. Never assume 
that the amount a lender is willing to lend you is the amount you can truly afford.

13
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
In addition to your income, the only other financial considerations a lender 
takes into account are your debts. Specifically, mortgage lenders examine the 
required monthly payments for other debts you may have, such as student 
loans, auto loans, and credit card bills. In addition to the percentage of your 
income that lenders allow for housing expenses, they typically allow an addi-
tional 5 percent of your monthly income to go toward other debt repayments.
Calculating your mortgage payment amount
After you know the amount you want to borrow, calculating the size of your 
mortgage payment is straightforward. The challenge is figuring how much 
you can comfortably afford to borrow given your other financial goals. This 
chapter should assist you in this regard, especially the previous section on 
analyzing your spending and goals.
Suppose you work through your budget and determine that you can afford to 
spend $2,000 per month on housing. Determining the exact size of mortgage 
that allows you to stay within this boundary may seem daunting, because 
your overall housing cost is comprised of several components: mortgage pay-
ments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.
Using Appendix A, you can calculate the size of your mortgage payments 
based on the amount you want to borrow, the loan’s interest rate, and 
whether you want a 15- or 30-year mortgage.
So you think you can handle excess borrowing?
Some people we know believe they can handle 
more mortgage debt than lenders allow using 
their handy-dandy ratios. Such borrowers may 
seek to borrow additional money from family, or 
they may fib about their income when filling out 
their mortgage applications.
Although some homeowners who stretch 
themselves financially do just fine, others 
end up in financial and emotional trouble. You 
should also know that, because lenders usually 
cross-check the information on your mortgage 
application with IRS Form 4506T, increasing 
numbers of borrowers who lie on their 
mortgage applications are caught and their 
applications denied.
So although we say that the lender’s word 
isn’t the gospel as to how much home you can 
truly afford, telling the truth on your mortgage 
application is the only way to go.
We should also note that telling the truth 
prevents you from committing perjury and 
fraud, troubles that catch even officials elected 
to high office. Bankers don’t want you to get in 
over your head financially and default on your 
loan, and we don’t want you to either.

14
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Paying property taxes
As you’re already painfully aware if you’re a homeowner now, you must pay 
property taxes to your local government. The taxes are generally paid to a divi-
sion typically called the County or Town Tax Collector. (If you make a smaller 
down payment — less than 20 percent of the home’s purchase price — you 
may have an impound account. Such an account requires you to pay your prop-
erty taxes, and often your homeowners insurance, to the lender each month 
along with your mortgage payment. The lender is responsible for making the 
necessary property tax and insurance payments to the appropriate agencies 
on your behalf.)
Property taxes are typically based on the value of a property. Because prop-
erty taxes vary from one locality to another, call the relevant local tax collec-
tor’s office to determine the exact rate in your area. (Check the government 
section of your local phone directory to find the phone number.) In addition 
to inquiring about the property tax rate in the town where you’re contemplat-
ing buying a home, also ask what additional fees and assessments may apply.
 
As you shop for a home, be aware that real estate listings frequently contain 
information regarding the amount the current property owner is currently 
paying in taxes. These taxes are often based upon an outdated, much lower 
property valuation. If you purchase the home, your property taxes may be 
significantly increased based on the price that you pay for the property.
Tracking your tax write-offs
Now is a good point to pause, recognize, and give thanks for the tax ben-
efits of homeownership. The federal tax authorities at the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) and most state governments allow you to deduct, within cer-
tain limits, mortgage interest and property taxes when you file your annual 
income tax return.
You may deduct the interest on the first $1 million of mortgage debt as well 
as all the property taxes. (This mortgage interest deductibility covers debt 
on both your primary residence and a second residence.) The IRS also allows 
you to deduct the interest costs on second mortgages known as home equity 
loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs, see Chapter 6) to a maximum 
of $100,000 borrowed.
To keep things simple and get a reliable estimate of the tax savings from 
your mortgage interest and property tax write-off, multiply your mortgage 
payment and property taxes by your federal income tax rate in Table 1-1. 
This approximation method works fine as long as you’re in the earlier years 

15
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
of paying off your mortgage, because the small portion of your mortgage 
payment that isn’t deductible (because it’s for the loan repayment) approxi-
mately offsets the overlooked state tax savings.

Investing in insurance
When you own a home with a mortgage, your mortgage lender will insist as 
a condition of funding your loan that you have adequate homeowners insur-
ance. The cost of your insurance policy is largely derived from the estimated 
cost of rebuilding your home. Although land has value, it doesn’t need to be 
insured, because it wouldn’t be destroyed in a fire. Buy the most comprehen-
sive homeowners insurance coverage you can and take the highest deduct-
ible you can afford, to help minimize the cost.
 
As a homeowner, you’d also be wise to obtain insurance coverage against 
possible damage, destruction, or theft of personal property such as clothing, 
furniture, kitchen appliances, audiovisual equipment, and your collection 
of vintage fire hydrants. Personal property goodies can cost big bucks to 
replace.
In years past, various lenders learned the hard way that some homeowners 
with little financial stake in the property and insufficient insurance coverage 
simply walked away from homes that were total losses and left the lender 
with the loss. Thus, nearly all lenders, especially those that sell mortgage 
loans in the financial markets, now require you to purchase private mortgage 
insurance if you put down less than 20 percent of the purchase price when 
you buy.
 
You may be able to avoid paying private mortgage insurance by using 80-10-10 
financing. We cover this technique in Chapter 6.

16
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Budgeting for closing costs
As you budget for a given home purchase, don’t forget to budget for the 
inevitable pile of one-time closing costs. In a typical home purchase, closing 
costs amount to about 2 to 5 percent of the purchase price of the property. 
Thus, you shouldn’t ignore them when you figure the amount of money you 
need to close the deal. Having enough to pay the down payment on your loan 
just isn’t sufficient.
As we discuss in Home Buying For Dummies (Wiley), if you’re short of cash, 
you can negotiate with the property seller to pay some or all of your clos-
ing costs. Expect to pay a higher interest rate for a mortgage with few or no 
upfront fees. And, all other things being equal, expect to pay and borrow 
more to entice the seller to pay your closing costs.
Here are the major closing costs and our guidance as to how much to budget 
for each:
 
 Loan-origination fees and charges: Lenders generally levy fees for 
appraising the property, obtaining a copy of your credit report, prepar-
ing your loan documents, and processing your loan. They’ll also whack 
you 1 to 2 percent of the loan amount for a loan-origination fee. Another 
term for this prepaid interest charge, as we explain in Chapter 9, is 
points. If you’re strapped for cash, you can get a loan that has few or no 
fees; however, such loans have higher interest rates over their lifetimes. 
You may be able to negotiate having the seller pay these loan-closing 
costs. The total loan-origination fees and other charges may add up to 
as much as 3 percent of the mortgage amount.
 
 Escrow fees: These costs cover the preparation and transmission of all 
home-purchase-related documents and funds. Escrow fees range from 
several hundred to over a thousand dollars, based on the purchase 
price of your home.
 
 Homeowners insurance: Lenders generally require that you pay the 
first year’s premium on your homeowners insurance policy at the time 
of closing. Such insurance typically costs from several hundred to a 
thousand dollars plus, depending upon the value of your home and the 
extent of coverage you desire.
 
 Title insurance: Title insurance protects you and the lender against the 
risk that the person selling you the home doesn’t legally own it. This 
insurance typically costs from several hundred to several thousand dol-
lars, depending on your home’s purchase price. Happily, the premium you 
pay at close of escrow is the only title insurance premium you’ll ever have 
to pay unless you subsequently decide to refinance your mortgage.
 
 Property taxes: At the closing of your home purchase, you may have 
to reimburse the sellers for property taxes that they paid in advance. 
Here’s how it works. Suppose you close on your home purchase on 

17
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
October 15, and the sellers have already paid their property taxes 
through December 31. You have to reimburse the sellers for property 
taxes they paid from October 15 through the end of the year. The pro-
rated property taxes you end up paying in your actual transaction are 
based upon the home’s taxes and the date that escrow actually closes 
and cost from several hundred to a couple of thousand dollars.
 
 Attorney fees: In some eastern states, lawyers are involved (unfortu-
nately from some participants’ perspectives) in real estate purchases. In 
most states, however, lawyers aren’t needed for home purchases as long 
as the real estate agents use standard, fill-in-the-blank contracts. If you 
do hire an attorney, expect to pay at least several hundred dollars.
 
 Property inspections: As we advocate in our best-selling book Home 
Buying For Dummies, you should always have a home professionally 
inspected before you buy it. Inspection fees usually cost at least several 
hundred dollars (larger homes cost more to inspect of course).
 
 Private mortgage insurance (PMI): If you make a down payment of less 
than 20 percent of the purchase price of the home, mortgage lenders 
generally require that you take out private mortgage insurance that pro-
tects the lender in case you default on your mortgage. You may need to 
pay up to a year’s worth of premium for this coverage at closing, which 
can amount to as much as several hundred dollars. One terrific way to 
avoid this extra cost is to make a 20-percent down payment.
 
 Prepaid loan interest: At closing, the lender charges interest on your 
mortgage to cover the interest that accrues from the date your loan is 
funded — generally one business day before the closing — up to the day 
of your first scheduled loan payment. How much interest you actually 
have to pay depends on the timing of your first loan payment.
 
 If you’re strapped for cash at closing, try the following tricks to minimize 
the prepaid loan interest you owe at closing:
 
• First, ask your lender which day of the month your payment will be 
due and schedule to close on the loan as few days in advance of that 
day as possible. (Payments are usually due on the first of the month, 
so closing on the 1st or a few days before is generally best.)
 
• Or ask whether your lender is willing to adjust your monthly due 
date closer to the date you desire to close on your loan.
 
• Also, never schedule a closing to occur on a Monday because the 
lender will have to put your mortgage funds into escrow the pre-
ceding Friday, causing you to pay interest for Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday. (Some lenders may be able to accommodate a Monday 
closing by same-day wiring the funds for an afternoon closing.)
 
 Other fees: Recording fees (to record the deed and mortgage), courier 
and express mailing fees, notary fees — you name it, and you can expect 
to get whacked another $20 to $50 for it. These extra expenses usually 
total about $200 to $300. Note: Ask your mortgage lender for a complete 
listing of all fees and charges.

Managing maintenance costs
In addition to costing you a monthly mortgage payment, homes also need 
painting, roof repairs, and other types of maintenance over time. Of course, 
some homeowners defer maintenance and even put their houses on the 
market for sale with lots of deferred maintenance (which, of course, will be 
reflected in a reduced sales price).
For budgeting purposes, we suggest that you allocate about 1 percent of the 
purchase price of your home each year for normal maintenance expenses. 
So, for example, if you spend $180,000 on a home, you should budget about 
$1,800 per year (or about $150 per month) for maintenance.
With some types of housing, such as condominiums, you pay monthly dues 
into a homeowner’s association, which takes care of the maintenance for the 
complex. In that case, you’re responsible for maintaining only the interior of 
your unit. Check with the association to see how much the dues are running, 
what services are included, and how they’ve changed over the years.
Financing home improvements and such 
In addition to necessary maintenance, also be aware of how much you may 
spend on nonessential home improvements such as adding a deck, remodel-
ing your kitchen, and so on. Budget for these nonessentials unless you’re the 
rare person who is a super saver, can easily accomplish your savings goals, 
and have lots of slack in your budget.
Watch out for the trash: Junk fees
Junk fees are loan charges paid directly to your 
lender or mortgage broker. Examples of these 
pernicious profit centers are a fee for processing 
your loan application, a fee for preparing your 
loan documents, a fee to underwrite your loan, 
a fee to warehouse your loan, and the ever-
popular miscellaneous fee.
Legitimate mortgage fees, conversely, are 
fees paid to third parties — including the firm 
handling your escrow, appraisers, credit report-
ing agencies, notaries, and country recorders. 
We cover these fees in the section on closing 
costs.
If your closing costs include junk fees that 
weren’t disclosed in the good faith estimate 
of loan costs your lender should’ve given you 
within three business days after you submitted 
your loan application, call your loan officer 
immediately. You can generally negotiate with 
the lender to either reduce or eliminate its 
garbage fees.

19
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
The amount you expect to spend on improvements is just a guess. It depends 
upon how finished a home you buy and your personal tastes and desires. 
Consider your previous spending behavior and the types of projects you 
expect to do as you examine potential homes for purchase.
Consider the Impact of a New House 
on Your Financial Future
As you collect your spending data, think about how your proposed home 
purchase will affect and change your spending habits and ability to save. For 
example, as a homeowner, if you live farther away from your job than you did 
when you rented, how much will your transportation expenses increase?
Table 1-2 can help you total all your current expenses and estimate future 
expected spending.

Acting upon your spending analysis
Tabulating your spending is only half the battle on the path to fiscal fitness and a 
financially successful home purchase. After all, many government entities know 
where they spend our tax dollars, but they still run up massive levels of debt! 
You must do something with the personal spending information you collect.
When most Americans examine their spending, especially if it’s the first time, 
they may be surprised and dismayed at the amount of their overall spending 
and how little they’re saving. How much is enough to save? The answer depends 
upon your goals and how good your investing skills are. For most people to 
reach their financial goals, they must annually save at least 10 percent of their 
gross (pretax) income.
From Eric’s experience as a personal financial counselor and lecturer, he 
knows that most people don’t know how much they’re currently saving, and 
even more people don’t know how much they should be saving. You should 
know these amounts before you buy your first home or trade up to a more 
costly property.
If you’re like most people planning to buy a first home, you need to reduce 
your spending in order to accumulate enough money to pay for the down 
payment and closing costs and create enough slack in your budget to afford 
the extra costs of homeownership. Trade-up buyers may have some of the 
same issues as well. Where you decide to make cuts in your budget is a 
matter of personal preference. Here are some proven ways to cut your 
spending now and in the future:
 
 Purge consumer debt. Debt on credit cards, auto loans, and the like is 
detrimental to your long-term financial health. Borrowing through 
consumer loans encourages you to live beyond your means, and the 
interest rates on consumer debt are high and not tax deductible. If you 
have accessible savings to pay down your consumer debts, do so as 
long as you have access to sufficient emergency money from family or 
other avenues.
 
 Trim nonessential spending. Although everyone needs food, shelter, 
clothing, and healthcare, most Americans spend a great deal of additional 
money on luxuries and nonessentials. Even some of what people spend on 
the “necessity” categories is partly for luxury.
 
 Purchase products and services that offer value. High quality doesn’t 
have to cost more. In fact, higher priced products and services are 
sometimes inferior to lower cost alternatives.
 
 Buy in bulk. Most items are cheaper per unit when you buy them in 
larger sizes or volumes. Superstores such as Costco and Wal-Mart offer 
family sizes and competitive pricing.

23
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
Establishing financial goals
Most people find it enlightening to see how much they need to save in order 
to accomplish particular goals. For example, wanting to retire someday is 
a common goal. And the good news is that you can take advantage of tax 
incentives while you save toward retirement.
Money that you contribute to an employer-based retirement plan — for 
example, a 401(k) — or to a self-employed plan — for example, a SEP-IRA 
or Keogh — is typically tax deductible at both the federal and state levels. 
Also, after you contribute money into a retirement account, the gains on that 
money compound over time without taxation.
If you’re accumulating down-payment money for the purchase of a home, 
putting that money into a retirement account is generally a bad idea. When 
you withdraw money from a retirement account, you owe not only current 
income taxes, but also hefty penalties — 10 percent of the amount withdrawn 
for the IRS plus whatever penalty your state charges.
If you’re trying to save for a real estate purchase and save toward retirement 
and reduce your taxes, you have a dilemma — assuming that, like most people, 
you have limited funds with which to work. The dilemma is that you can save 
outside of retirement accounts and have access to your down-payment money 
but pay much more in taxes. Or you can fund your retirement accounts and 
gain tax benefits, but lack access to the money for your home purchase.
You have two ways to skirt this dilemma:
 
 Borrow against your employer’s retirement plan. Some employers’ 
retirement plans, especially those in larger companies, allow borrowing 
against retirement savings plan balances. Some companies offer first-
time homebuyers a little financial assistance, so make sure you ask.
 
 Implement a first-time home-buyer IRA withdrawal. If you have an 
Individual Retirement Account (either a standard IRA or a newer Roth 
IRA), you’re allowed to withdraw up to $10,000 (lifetime maximum) toward 
a home purchase as long as you haven’t owned a home for the past two 
years. Tapping into a Roth IRA is a better deal because the withdrawal is 
free from income tax as long as the Roth account is at least five years old. 
Although a standard IRA has no such time restriction, withdrawals are 
taxed as income, so you’ll net only the after-tax amount of the withdrawal 
toward your down payment.
Because most people have limited discretionary dollars, you must decide 
what your priorities are. Saving for retirement and reducing your taxes are 
important goals; but when you’re trying to save to purchase a home, some or 

24
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
most of your savings needs to be outside a tax-sheltered retirement account. 
Putting your retirement savings on the back burner for a short time in order to 
build up your down-payment cushion is fine. However, be sure to purchase a 
home that offers enough slack in your budget to fund your retirement accounts 
after the purchase.
Making down-payment decisions
Most people borrow money for a simple reason: They want to buy something 
they can’t afford to pay for in a lump sum. How many 18-year-olds and their 
parents have the extra cash to pay for the full cost of a college education? 
Or prospective homebuyers to pay for the full purchase price of a home? So 
people borrow.
When used properly, debt can help you accomplish your financial goals and 
make you more money in the long run. But if your financial situation allows 
you to make a larger than necessary down payment, consider how much debt 
you need or want. With most lenders, as we discuss in Chapter 5, you’ll get 
access to the best rates on mortgage loans by making a down payment of at 
least 20 percent. Whether or not making a larger down payment makes sense 
for you depends on a number of factors, such as your other options and 
goals.
The potential rate of return that you expect/hope to earn on investments is 
a critical factor when you decide whether to make a larger down payment 
or make other investments. Psychologically, however, some people feel 
uncomfortable making a larger down payment because it diminishes their 
savings and investments.
You probably don’t want to make a larger down payment if it depletes your 
emergency financial cushion. But don’t be tripped up by the misconception 
that somehow you’ll be harmed more by a real estate market crash if you pay 
down your mortgage. Your home is worth what it’s worth — its value has 
nothing to do with the size of your mortgage.
Financially, what matters in deciding to make a larger down payment is the 
rate of interest you’re paying on your mortgage versus the rate of return your 
investments are generating. Suppose that you get a fixed-rate mortgage at 6 
percent. In order for you to come out financially ahead making investments 
instead of making a larger down payment, your investments need to produce 
an average annual rate of return, before taxes, of about 6 percent.

25
 Chapter 1: Determining Your Borrowing Power
Although it’s true that mortgage interest is usually tax deductible, don’t 
forget that you must also pay taxes on investments held outside of retirement 
accounts. You could purchase tax-free investments, such as municipal bonds, 
but over the long haul, you probably won’t be able to earn a high enough rate 
of return on such bonds versus the cost of the mortgage. Other types of fixed-
income investments, such as bank savings accounts, CDs, and other bonds, are 
also highly unlikely to pay a high enough return.
And don’t assume that those mortgage interest deductions are that great. 
Many high-income earners, for example, still don’t realize that they’ve lost 
the ability to fully deduct their mortgage interest on their tax returns. If your 
adjusted gross income (taxable income from all sources before subtracting 
itemized deductions and personal exemptions) exceeds $159,950 in 2008, you 
start to lose some of your mortgage interest deduction.
In order for you to have a reasonable chance of earning more on your invest-
ments than it’s costing you to borrow on a mortgage, you must be willing to 
invest in more growth-oriented, volatile investments such as stocks and rental/
investment real estate. Over the past two centuries, stocks and real estate 
have produced annual average rates of return of about 9 to 10 percent. On the 
other hand, there are no guarantees that you’ll earn these returns in the future. 
Growth-type investments can easily drop 20 percent or more in value over 
short time periods (such as one to three years).

Qualifying for a Mortgage
In This Chapter
 Starting off right with preapprovals
 Understanding how lenders size up borrowers
 Solving typical mortgage problems
W
e love a good thriller. If you’re looking for a spine-tingling mystery, 
however, Mortgages For Dummies isn’t it.
Qualifying for a mortgage shouldn’t be the least bit mystifying. And after you 
understand how lenders play the game, it won’t be. This chapter removes 
nearly every bit of puzzlement from the process. We show you exactly how to 
get started, tell you what lenders look for when evaluating your creditworthi-
ness, and help you solve your mortgage problems.
Getting Preapproved for a Loan
Everyone knows that time is money, so we decided to begin this section with 
a timesaving tip. If you’re a homeowner who wants to refinance an existing 
mortgage, you have our permission to proceed directly to the next section, 
which discloses how lenders evaluate your credit. This segment applies 
only to folks who haven’t bought a house yet. (Don’t feel slighted. We devote 
Chapter 11 entirely to the fine art of refinancing.)
Now, for all you wannabe homeowners, be advised that there’s a right way and 
a wrong way to start the home-buying process. The wrong way, astonishingly, 
is rushing out helter-skelter to gawk at houses you think you may want to buy.
As we point out in Home Buying For Dummies, it’s important that you know 
what’s on the market. It’s even more crucial to educate yourself so you can 
distinguish between houses that are priced to sell and ridiculously overpriced 
turkeys. If you don’t know the difference between price and value, you could 
end up paying waaaaaaaaaay too much for the home you ultimately purchase.
But . . . first things first: If you can’t pay, you shouldn’t play.

28
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
The worst case scenario
Suppose you’ve been looking at open houses from dawn to dusk every 
Saturday and Sunday for the past seven weeks. Just when you begin to think 
you’ll never find your dream home, it miraculously appears on the market.
You immediately make an offer to buy casa magnífico, conditioned upon your 
approval of the property inspections and obtaining satisfactory financing. 
When the sellers accept your generous offer, the bluebird of happiness sings 
joyously.
Three weeks later, the bird croaks. Your loan officer calls to regretfully 
advise you that the bank has rejected your loan application. The reason isn’t 
because you offered too much for the house. On the contrary, the appraisal 
confirmed that the property is worth every penny you’re willing to pay.
The problem, dear reader, could be you. Unfortunately, your present income 
and projected expenses may be out of whack. You may not earn enough 
money to make the monthly mortgage payments plus pay the property taxes 
and homeowners insurance without pauperizing yourself. Adding insult 
to injury, this depressing discovery is delivered to you after you’ve blown 
hundreds of dollars on property inspections and loan fees and put yourself 
through an emotional wringer for three weeks.
Now the good news: It doesn’t have to be this way. After you establish how 
much you can prudently spend for your dream home, which we cover in 
Chapter 1, the next logical step is to get yourself preapproved for a mortgage. 
Then you’re properly prepared to begin your house hunt.
Loan prequalification usually 
isn’t good enough
You can use two techniques to get a lender’s opinion of your creditworthi-
ness as a borrower. One is the better way to go. The other is potentially a 
waste of your time and money and may even be grossly misleading.
We start by critiquing the second-rate method. Loan prequalification is noth-
ing more than a casual conversation with a loan officer. After quickly quizzing 
you about obvious financial matters, such as your present income, expenses, 
and cash savings for a down payment, the loan officer renders a down-and-
dirty guesstimate of approximately how much money he might lend you at 
current mortgage interest rates assuming that everything you’ve said is accu-
rate. Most lenders graciously provide a prequalification letter suitable for 
framing or swatting mosquitoes.

29
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
Prequalification is fast and cheap. It rarely takes more than 15 minutes unless 
you’re the type who has trouble parking.
 
Because the lender doesn’t substantiate anything you say, the lender isn’t 
bound by the prequalification process to make a loan when you’re ready to 
buy. When your finances are scrutinized during the formal mortgage approval 
process, the lender may discover additional financial liabilities or derogatory 
credit information that reduces your borrowing power. In that case, you end 
up squandering precious time and money looking at property you aren’t quali-
fied to buy.
Loan preapproval is generally 
the way to go
After you read this section, you’ll understand why formally evaluating your 
creditworthiness is such a protracted process. Loan preapproval is signifi-
cantly more involved than mere loan prequalification.
Preapproval involves a thorough investigation of your credit history. In addi-
tion, the lender independently documents and verifies your present income 
and expenses, the amount of cash you have on hand, assets and liabilities, 
and even your prospects for continued employment. If you’re self-employed, 
the lender conducts a diligent analysis of your federal tax returns for the past 
couple of years.
Obtaining the credit report, verifications of income and employment, bank 
statements, and other necessary documentation usually takes a week or two. 
That’s time well spent. Getting preapproved for a mortgage gives you two 
huge advantages:
 
 You know how much you can borrow. Being preapproved for a loan 
is almost as good as having a line of credit when you start house hunt-
ing. The only thing the lender can’t preapprove is the house you buy. 
Because you haven’t begun looking at property yet, your dream home is 
still only a twinkle in your eye.
 
 Be sure to stay in touch with your lender during your house hunt. The 
amount you’ve been preapproved to borrow is written on paper, not 
carved in stone. Lenders won’t give you a firm commitment on your 
loan’s interest rate until you actually have a signed contract to buy your 
dream home. If interest rates increase (or your employment income 
declines) after you’re preapproved for a mortgage, the loan amount 
decreases accordingly. By the same token, you can borrow even more if 
interest rates happen to decline (or you get a well-deserved pay raise).

30
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
 You have an advantage in multiple-offer situations. In a hot real estate 
market, you may end up competing with other buyers for the same prop-
erty. Being preapproved is proof positive to sellers that you’re a real buyer. 
Your offer will be given far more serious consideration than offers from 
buyers who haven’t bothered to prove that they’re creditworthy.
 
Some lenders offer free loan preapprovals to prospective homebuyers as a 
marketing ploy to endear themselves to borrowers. However, others charge 
for loan preapproval. Don’t choose a lender only because you can get a freebie 
preapproval. Such a lender may not offer the most competitive rates, which 
could cost you far more in the long run. In Chapter 7, we take the mystery out 
of selecting a lender.
Evaluating Your Creditworthiness: 
The Underwriting Process
Suppose your best friend hits you up for a loan. If your pal wants to borrow 
five or ten bucks until payday, that’s no big deal. But if your acquaintance 
needs five or ten thousand dollars for a decade or so, you’ll probably analyze 
the odds of getting repaid six ways to Sunday before parting with a nickel!
Good lending institutions are even more careful with their depositors’ funds. 
They employ professional underwriters, who evaluate the degree of risk 
involved in loans that the lenders have been asked to make to prospective 
borrowers. In other words, underwriters tell the lender how much risk is 
involved in lending money to you. If they determine that you’re too risky, 
chances are you won’t get the loan. Underwriting standards vary consider-
ably from lender to lender.
 
 Most lenders comply with underwriting guidelines of two institutions, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). These lenders sell 
their loans on the secondary mortgage market to Freddie Mac or Fannie 
Mae, who then resell the loans to investors such as insurance compa-
nies and pension funds.
 
 Portfolio lenders, who keep loans they originate instead of selling them 
in the secondary mortgage market, may have more flexible underwriting 
standards.
 
Just because one lender turns you down doesn’t mean that all lenders will. If 
you’re having trouble getting a loan approved, head for a portfolio lender in 
your area. In addition to your own interviewing of lenders, a good mortgage 
broker can help you identify more flexible (portfolio) lenders; see Chapter 7. 
This section helps you navigate the underwriting process.

31
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
Traditional underwriting guidelines
Underwriting standards vary from lender to lender, because the underwrit-
ers who examine loan applications are flesh-and-blood human beings, not 
machines. Two underwriters can evaluate the exact same loan application 
and reach different conclusions (regarding the degree of risk involved in 
making the loan), because each interprets the traditional underwriting guide-
lines differently.
To get a mortgage, you must give a lender the right to take your home away 
from you and sell it to pay the balance due on your loan if you:
 
 Don’t make your loan payments
 
 Fail to pay your property taxes
 
 Let your homeowners insurance policy lapse
The legal action taken by a lender to repossess property and sell it to satisfy 
mortgage debt is called a foreclosure. Lenders detest foreclosures. They’re 
typically financially detrimental and emotionally debilitating for everyone 
involved in the transaction, and they generate awful public relations for the 
lender. And, if a lending institution has too many foreclosures, state and fed-
eral bank regulators begin questioning the lender’s judgment.
Lenders constantly fine-tune the way they evaluate mortgage applications in 
search of better screening techniques to keep borrowers — and themselves — 
out of foreclosure. The sections that follow explain the primary factors 
that lenders have traditionally used to assess prospective borrowers’ 
creditworthiness.
Integrity
Lenders look closely at you when deciding whether or not to approve your 
loan request. They want to know whether you’re a good player. Will you keep 
your word? How great an effort will you make to repay the loan?
One of the first things a loan processor does after you submit a loan applica-
tion is order a credit report. Surprisingly, blemishes on your credit record 
aren’t always the kiss of death. Contrary to what you may have heard, lend-
ers are human. They understand that financial difficulties related to one-time 
situations such as a divorce, job loss, or serious medical problems can smite 
even the best of us.
As we discuss in Chapter 10, all loan applications contain a “Declarations” 
section that’s chock-full of red-flag questions. For instance, this section asks 
whether you’ve ever had a property foreclosed upon.

32
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
As a result of the late 2000s housing market slump and mortgage meltdown, 
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae issued extremely stringent underwriting guide-
lines for loan applicants who’ve had a foreclosure. In such cases, the applica-
tion is manually scrutinized by underwriters probing for all facts related to 
the foreclosure. Check out Chapter 13 for more info on foreclosures.
If you answer “yes” to any of these red-flag questions, lenders want all the 
details. Even with the blemish of a bankruptcy or foreclosure in your credit 
history, however, you’ll get favorable consideration from lenders if you 
established a repayment plan for your creditors. That commitment demon-
strates integrity.
Conversely, people who’ve skipped out on their financial obligations are 
treated like roadkill. Lenders figure that if borrowers have cut and run once, 
they’ll probably do it again.
Income and job stability
From 2000 to 2005 during the peak of the residential lending frenzy, no doc 
or stated income loans were, regrettably, far too easy to get. No doc loans are 
loans made without written documentation for such things as the borrowers’ 
income, assets and liabilities. Some borrowers claimed as much income as 
they needed to get their loan approved without having to substantiate their 
income. Lenders disparagingly referred to these mortgages as liar loans or 
pulse loans. If you had a pulse, you got a loan.
Fortunately, those reckless ways are long gone. Now you have to not only 
have a job, but you also better be able to prove it.
Lenders don’t want you to overextend yourself. They know from past expe-
rience that the number-one cause of foreclosures is borrowers spreading 
themselves too thin financially. Most lenders ask for your two most recent 
IRS W-2 forms to establish your gross annual income plus the last 30 days of 
pay stubs as proof that you’re still employed.
If a lender can’t qualify you by using W-2s and pay stubs, the loan processor 
sends your employer a verification of employment (VOE) letter to indepen-
dently confirm the employment information on your loan application, includ-
ing your income, how long you’ve had your present job, and your prospects 
for continued employment.
Some lenders are more lenient than others are when they see that a prospec-
tive borrower has a history of job-hopping. All lenders, however, must be 
certain that you have a high likelihood of uninterrupted income. If you don’t 
get paid, how will they?

33
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
Debt-to-income ratio
Lenders aren’t as concerned about short-term loans that you’ll pay off in 
fewer than ten months. They will, however, add 5 percent of any unpaid 
revolving credit charges to your monthly debt load.
For example, suppose you earn $4,000 per month. If your current monthly 
long-term debt plus the projected homeownership expenses total $1,200 a 
month, your debt-to-income ratio is 30 percent ($1,200 divided by $4,000).
If your debt-to-income ratio is on the high side, a lender puts your loan 
application under a microscope. Even if all your credit cards are current, 
the lender may insist as a condition of making the loan that you pay off and 
cancel some of your credit cards to reduce your potential borrowing power. 
Doing so reduces the risk of future default on your loan.
 
If you want to increase the odds of having your loan approved and accom-
plishing your financial goals, lower your debt-to-income ratio by paying off 
small loans and credit card debt and closing any unused open credit accounts 
prior to applying for a mortgage. An excessive number of open accounts 
reduces your credit rating.
Property appraisal
Lenders must find out what the house you want to mortgage is currently 
worth, because the property is used to secure your loan. They do this by get-
ting an appraisal, a written report prepared by an appraiser (the person who 
evaluates property for lenders) that contains an estimate or opinion of fair 
market value. The reliability of an appraisal depends upon the competence 
and integrity of the appraiser.
Loan-to-value ratio
A loan-to-value ratio, or LTV, is a quick way for lenders to guesstimate how 
risky a mortgage may be. LTV is simply the loan amount divided by the 
property’s appraised value. For instance, if you’re borrowing $150,000 to 
buy a home with an appraised value of $200,000, the loan-to-value ratio is 
75 percent (your $150,000 loan divided by the $200,000 appraised value).
The more cash you put down, the lower your loan-to-value ratio and, from a 
lender’s perspective, the lower the odds that you’ll default on your loan. It 
stands to reason that you’re less likely to default on a mortgage if you have a 
lot of money invested in your property.
Conversely, the higher the LTV, the greater a lender’s risk if problems arise 
later with your loan. That’s why most lenders charge higher interest rates 
and loan fees or require private mortgage insurance (see Chapter 4) when-
ever the amount borrowed pushes the loan-to-value ratio (as determined by 
appraisal) above 80 percent.

34
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Underwriting standards for loan-to-value ratios vary widely from lender to 
lender. A portfolio lender, for example, may feel comfortable with a higher 
debt-to-income ratio if your LTV is low because you made a big cash down 
payment.
Finding red flags on loan applications
Ray Britton, senior vice president of a nation-
wide financial institution for many years, said 
that he learned the hard way that nearly 25 
percent of people applying for mortgages fal-
sify information on their loan applications. That 
statistic doesn’t mean that one out of every four 
borrowers is a crook. On the contrary, Britton 
felt that most people are basically honest.
He said that folks just want to improve the 
odds of having their loan approved. So they 
“enhance” the loan application by overstat-
ing income, understating expenses, or fibbing 
about the source of their cash down payment.
Lenders aren’t stupid. They’re trained to spot 
inconsistencies between data on loan applica-
tions and tax returns. They scrutinize verifica-
tions of employment and bank statements. If 
they’re given a post office box for an employer’s 
address, they know that it’s probably the appli-
cant’s post office box.
For instance, when Britton saw high-income 
borrowers with little or no cash on deposit, he 
checked for hidden liabilities. Another red flag 
is a high-income earner who recently opened 
several lines of credit.
Young people with lots of cash in the bank also 
made Britton suspicious. By checking several 
months of bank statements, he often discovered 
a big deposit had been made shortly before the 
application was submitted. That sudden deposit 
usually meant that they’d gotten financial aid 
from their parents.
Britton said that there’s nothing wrong with 
parents giving their children money for a down 
payment. If, however, the “gift” is actually a 
loan that must be repaid in addition to the mort-
gage payments, the kids could end up in serious 
financial trouble.
Another potential red flag is a claim by the 
applicants that they don’t have any credit cards 
or credit history. Britton said that it’s highly 
unusual to find anyone who hasn’t at least had 
a car loan or some type of credit card.
Whenever he saw a loan application without 
any credit references, he suspected the worst: 
applicants who were either trying to hide a bad 
credit record or a bankruptcy. Sure enough, 
one or the other almost always showed up on 
their credit report.
Britton hated foreclosures! He worked with 
good borrowers in temporary financial difficul-
ties by restructuring their loan payments to help 
them get through the rough times.
But if he discovered that the borrowers were 
in over their heads because they had exag-
gerated their income and hidden some of their 
expenses, Britton had no alternative. He regret-
fully said that the borrowers shouldn’t have 
abused a loan process intended to protect them 
from overextending themselves.

Cash reserves
As a condition of making your loan, some lenders insist that you have enough 
cash or other liquid assets, such as bonds, to provide a two- or three-month 
reserve to cover all your living expenses in the event of an emergency. Other 
lenders reduce their cash reserve requirements if you have a low debt-to-
income ratio or a low LTV.
New underwriting technology
The mortgage finance industry has undergone sweeping technological 
changes that profoundly transformed the way lenders make loans. The two 
big innovations have been automated underwriting and credit scores.
Automated underwriting
The mortgage origination process used to be a torturously slow, hideously 
expensive, ridiculously redundant paper shuffle designed by the devil to 
drive miserable mortals stark raving mad. Not anymore.
Now automated underwriting programs objectively and accurately evalu-
ate the multitude of risk factors present in most loan applications. Although 
these computerized programs will never completely eliminate human judg-
ment, they’ve greatly reduced the sheer volume of paperwork involved in 
the traditional underwriting process.
Reduced paperwork has cut borrower’s loan-origination costs by hundreds 
of dollars per mortgage. And that’s not all. Thanks to automated underwriting 
programs, mortgages that used to require weeks or, worse, months to pro-
cess and approve can be handled from start to finish in, gasp, minutes.
Catching on to credit scores
According to information provided by Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation), credit scores developed by analyzing borrowers’ 
credit histories served as a bridge between traditional underwriting and auto-
mated underwriting systems. Studies conducted by Freddie Mac have proven 
that credit scores are excellent predictors of mortgage-loan performance.
Credit scores have nothing to do with a borrower’s age, race, gender, reli-
gion, national origin, or marital status. Your credit score is determined by 
analyzing your record of paying debts. The following factors are considered:
 
 Public records pertaining to credit: A search of public records in the 
county recorder’s office shows whether you’ve ever declared bank-
ruptcy. It also indicates whether legal claims have ever been filed 

36
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
against property you own to secure payment of money owed for delin-
quent loans, lawsuits, or judgments.
 
 Outstanding balances against available credit limits: What is the bal-
ance due on mortgages and consumer installment debt such as car 
loans, charge accounts, and credit cards? Outstanding balances that 
exceed 80 percent of your available credit limits put you in the category 
of a higher-risk borrower.
 
 The age of delinquent accounts: Another indicator of higher risk is 
whether you have been or are currently 60 or more days delinquent on 
your credit card or charge account debt or other loan payments.
 
 Recent inquiries generated by a borrower seeking credit: Having four 
or more applicant-generated credit inquiries in the past year indicates 
that you may need a slew of new loans or credit cards because you’ve 
maxed out your current ones. From a lender’s perspective, that’s an 
alarming development.
The credit scoring methodology most lenders use today was developed by 
Fair Isaac Corporation and is called a FICO score. FICO scores range from a 
low of 300 to a maximum of 850. If you’re just itching to discover much, much 
more about credit scoring, Chapter 3 can scratch that itch.
Freddie Mac analyzed a broad sampling of 25,000 loans made by the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA). It found that borrowers with FICO scores of 680 
or more are highly unlikely to default on their mortgages. These creditworthy 
borrowers are rewarded with lower loan-origination fees and mortgage inter-
est rates. Conversely, a FICO score of 620 or less is a strong indication that a 
borrower’s credit reputation isn’t acceptable. As a result, borrowers with low 
FICO scores are charged higher loan-origination fees and mortgage interest 
rates to compensate for their loans’ higher risk of default.
Eyeing Predicament-Solving Strategies
If you need proof positive that perfection is an admirable but ultimately unat-
tainable quality, let a lender investigate your creditworthiness. Your financial 
flaws will be exposed to harsh scrutiny like a mess of worms wiggling when a 
rock is first turned over.
Mighty few folks have flawless credit and limitless cash. Run-of-the-mill 
ordinary mortals have a plethora of extremely human imperfections. Most 
individuals need a bit of assistance to surmount their shortcomings. The fol-
lowing sections are chock-full of suggestions you can use to solve the most 
common mortgage problems.

 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
Insufficient cash for a down payment
When subprime lending was at its height, getting 100 percent financing for 
home purchases was easy. Not anymore. Now lenders wisely insist that you 
have “skin in the game.” That’s their catchy way of saying you must put some 
of your own money into the transaction. Even if you make only a modest 5 or 
10 percent cash down payment, they figure you’ll be less likely to walk away 
from the loan because you also have money at stake.
Some things, like the exquisite hue of your baby blue eyes, are permanent 
and can’t be permanently changed no matter what you do. Fortunately, a 
shortage of legal tender (that’s cold, hard cash for the less sophisticated) 
can be nothing more than a temporary inconvenience if you’re sufficiently 
resourceful, motivated, and disciplined.
 
Plenty of people have respectable incomes. For one reason or another, many 
of them haven’t been able to sock away much money in the form of cash sav-
ings or other readily liquid assets. If you’re income rich and cash poor, here’s 
a herd of cash cows mooing to be milked:
 
 You: Put yourself on a budget by eliminating life’s little excesses. Rent 
a DVD for a couple of bucks instead of forking over the better part of 
$20 to gaze at a first-run flick while munching on pricey popcorn. Don’t 
buy so many fancy designer outfits. Skip that expensive ski vacation, 
and check out the local museums instead. Take a brown bag lunch to 
work, and eat dinner at home. Stifle the urge to be the first one on your 
block to own the latest technologic or electronic gadget. Stop smoking. 
Squirrel away all the money you don’t waste on frivolities. You’ll be 
astonished to see how quickly your savings grow.
 
 GI financing: Contrary to what you may think, GI financing isn’t 
restricted to veterans. The GI we’re referring to here is known as gener-
ous in-laws. Some parents help their children, married or not, purchase 
property by giving their kids cash for a down payment. Assuming that 
your parents have owned their home a long time, it’s probably worth 
considerably more today than it was when they bought it way back 
when. If they get a loan on their house to obtain cash that they give you, 
their increased indebtedness doesn’t affect your borrowing power.
 
 Under current tax law, a parent, friend, or mysterious stranger, for that 
matter, can give you, your spouse, and each of your kids tax-free gifts of 
up to $12,000 per calendar year. For example, suppose you’re happily 
married, have three adorable kids, and have truly generous in-laws. To 
help you buy your dream home, your munificent mother-in-law bestows 
a $60,000 gift ($12,000 per family member) upon the family. Ditto your 
fabulous father-in-law, for a total gift of $120,000 from your in-laws. (And 

38
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
if this gifting happens near the end of the year, they could each give 
you a gift in December and another in January, which would increase 
the total to a truly grand $240,000. Now aren’t you sorry about all those 
dreadful things you said about them?)
 
 Your employer: If you’re relocating at the request of your employer, find 
out whether your company will pay some or all of your down payment 
and other home purchase costs as an employee benefit.
 
 Tax refund: Don’t fritter away next year’s federal or state income tax 
refund on baubles like a second yacht or that spiffy new Rolls Royce. 
Apply it to your down payment.
 
 Life insurance: If you have a whole-life policy, check to see how much 
cash value you’ve built up. Replace the whole-life policy with term life 
insurance to maintain your insurance coverage (or go without life cover-
age if you have no one dependent upon you financially) and free up the 
cash value to use for a down payment.
 
 Bonus: What better way to invest that huge year-end bonus the boss 
promised?
 
 Income tax withholding allowance: If you’re a salaried employee and 
you’ve gotten hefty tax refunds in the past, try increasing the number 
of dependents on your IRS W-4 form. (Complete the worksheet to see 
whether it makes sense.) Doing so will reduce the amount of tax that’s 
withheld from your check (so you don’t have to wait to get it back from 
the government). Put the extra money toward your down payment.
 
 Retirement plans: Congress has publicly gone on record to say that 
homeownership is a basic component of the American Dream. To that 
end, the law now allows you, if you’re a first-time homebuyer, to with-
draw up to $10,000 from your IRAs if you use the money to acquire your 
principal residence. (Married couples can each withdraw up to $10,000 
from their own IRAs.) To avoid a 10-percent penalty tax for an early 
withdrawal (withdrawals before you reach age 591/2), you must be a 
first-time buyer who hasn’t owned a home for at least two years prior to 
the acquisition of your new primary residence. The funds must be used 
within 120 days of withdrawal in order to purchase or build your home. 
Many 401(k) plans also permit borrowing for a home down payment. 
Check with your benefits office.
 
 Real estate: If you own a vacation home or rental real estate that has 
appreciated in value, you can probably pull cash out of the property by 
refinancing the existing mortgage.
 
 Loans are a two-edged sword. Any loan that increases your overall 
indebtedness reduces your borrowing power accordingly. This is true 
whether the loan in question is an unsecured personal loan from a 
friend or your credit union, is secured by a mortgage on real estate, or is 
secured by personal property such as a car, boat, or jewelry.

39
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
 
 Equity sharing: This technique allows two or more people to buy a house 
that one or more of them occupies as a primary residence. For example, a 
nonoccupant investor pays the down payment and closing costs in return 
for a 25-percent interest in the property. You, as the occupant/co-owner, 
get a 75-percent ownership stake for making the monthly mortgage pay-
ments as well as paying the property tax, the homeowners insurance 
premium, and all other maintenance expenses. Any increase in value is 
split according to the terms of the equity-sharing agreement either after a 
specified period of time, such as five years, or when the property is sold.
 
 Although unrelated people use equity sharing, it works best between 
parents and their children. Given a well-crafted written agreement, 
equity sharing is an ideal win-win situation. Your parents get tax benefits 
and share in the house’s appreciation while helping you buy a home. 
You get a home of your own with little or no cash down, you enjoy tax 
deductions for your specified percentage of the mortgage interest and 
property tax payments, and you also share in the home’s appreciation. 
For more detailed information about drawing up a legally binding equity 
sharing agreement, consult a qualified tax lawyer.
 
 State or federal programs for first-time buyers: Freddie Mac, Fannie 
Mae, the FHA, and many states have financial aid programs designed to 
assist low- or moderate-income buyers in purchasing their first home 
with little money down (see Chapter 4).
 
 Seller (owner-carry) financing: This technique may make it possible to 
purchase real estate with relatively little cash, because the seller takes 
some of the sale price in the form of a loan. For instance, you put 10 
percent of the cash down, the owner carries back a 10-percent second 
mortgage, and you get an 80-percent first mortgage from a conventional 
lending institution (see Chapter 6 for more about seller financing used 
with 80-10-10 financing).
 
 The number of owners willing to carry financing ebbs and flows like the 
tide. When conventional mortgage interest rates are high, many sellers 
offer lower-interest-rate second mortgages to help sell their houses. 
However, even when conventional mortgage rates are cheap, a few sell-
ers do owner-carry financing for tax purposes or because owner-carry 
financing has an attractive interest rate compared to returns they could 
get on other investments.
 
 Private mortgage insurance (PMI): Thanks to the availability of PMI, 
conventional lenders offer special loan programs for cash-poor buyers 
with strong incomes. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the 
purchase price, you’ll have to buy private mortgage insurance to pro-
tect the lender in case you go belly up and the lender has to foreclose. 
Getting PMI may increase your loan origination fee and will increase 
your monthly loan payment. However, without PMI you couldn’t buy 
with such a low down payment.

40
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
 Stock or stock options: Selling stock or stock options is a quick way to 
get your down payment. If you do so, be sure you understand the tax 
consequences and make provisions to cover the state and federal capi-
tal gains taxes generated by the sale.
 
 Sale of other assets: What better time to convert your collection of rare 
stamps, gold coins, vintage baseball cards, first-edition comic books, or 
whatever else is collecting dust into cold, hard, down-payment cash?
 
 Lottery tickets: Hey. Somebody always wins the lottery sooner or later. It 
may as well be you. Stranger things have happened. Your luck is bound to 
change eventually. You have our permission to squander up to a buck a 
week. If, however, you crave a slightly more certain way to obtain cash for 
a down payment, we urge you to review our previous 15 suggestions.
Excessive indebtedness
Death is nature’s Draconian way of telling us to slow down. Having your mort-
gage application rejected because you’re in hock up to your hip-huggers is 
the lender’s gentle suggestion that you’d be wise to put your financial house 
in order.
Even if you’re only moderately overextended, the lender has done you a tre-
mendous favor by turning you down. If your debt-to-income ratio is too high 
before buying a house, piling on additional debt in the form of mortgage pay-
ments and homeownership expenses will probably turn your dream home 
into a fiscal nightmare.
Face it. Even though you’re perfectly willing to shoulder the additional finan-
cial burden of homeownership, the lender is telling you that too much debt 
will ravage your ability to live within your means. You won’t own the house, 
the house will own you.
 
Here are four ways to handle this problem:
 
 Reduce long-term indebtedness. If you’re close to being able to qualify 
for a mortgage, paying off a chunk of installment-type debt such as a 
student loan or car loan will most likely bring your debt-to-income ratio 
within acceptable limits. Discuss this game plan with your lender. (Car 
loans and other long-term installment debt with ten or fewer payments 
remaining are typically not considered long-term debt.)
 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don’t like total monthly payments on long-
term indebtedness (including your mortgage) to exceed 40 to 45 percent 
or so of your gross monthly income.

41
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
 
 Expand income or restrict living expenses. If you’re living way beyond 
your means, you have two choices: Increase your income or, more real-
istically, put yourself on a stringent financial diet to reduce your blimp-
ish budget. For help with this, read Chapter 1 (if you haven’t already). It 
helps you identify areas where you can make budget cuts.
 
 Get real. If you have champagne tastes and an unalterable beer budget, 
something’s gotta give. Ask your lender to define the outer limits of your 
realistic purchasing power. The easiest way to cut your payments for a 
mortgage, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and other ownership 
expenses is to buy a less expensive home.
 
 Reach out and touch someone. If you’re lucky enough to have fiscally 
powerful parents or relatives to whom you can turn for financial assis-
tance, you have a huge advantage. Consider using it. Don’t let false pride 
about asking them for a loan or having them cosign a mortgage prevent 
you from owning a home. After all, in many areas of the country, prop-
erty is much more expensive today than it was back in the Stone Age 
when your mom and dad bought their first home.
 
Cosigning a mortgage is inherently risky for the co-borrowers. If you make 
payments late or, worse, default on your loan, you sully your cosigners’ credit 
record every bit as much as your own. Even if you mail in your monthly loan 
payments long before they’re due, however, the cosigners’ borrowing power 
is reduced, because they have a contingent liability to repay your loan if you 
default. In fairness, you should discuss these financial ramifications with your 
co-borrowers before they cosign your loan papers.
Insufficient income
Even if you have plenty of cash for a down payment and no debt whatsoever, 
you may still experience the despair of rejection. Lenders frequently turn 
down loan applicants if they believe the financial burdens of homeownership 
will be too great. As is the case with excessive indebtedness, the lenders are 
trying to protect you from yourself as well as protect their own interests.
Before you throw a stink bomb in the lender’s lobby, please read the section 
in Chapter 1 about determining how much home you can realistically afford. 
For example, suppose you currently aren’t earning much, because the busi-
ness you started last year is gushing buckets of red ink. Under the circum-
stances, it would probably be prudent to wait another year or two to prove 
conclusively to the lender — and yourself — that your business is capable of 
producing profits.

42
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
If (after reviewing Chapter 1) you still believe that the lender is being too 
paternalistic, take a look at these two suggestions that may help get your 
loan approved:
 
 Increase your down payment. If you’re cash rich and income poor, 
make an even larger down payment. The more money you have in the 
property, the lower the lender’s risk that you’ll default on your mort-
gage. Some lenders have easy-qualifier loan programs with less restric-
tive income requirements for applicants who make cash down payments 
that exceed 25 percent of their home’s purchase price.
 
 These loans aren’t premium quality mortgages. Lenders usually charge 
higher loan origination fees and mortgage interest rates on their easy-
qualifier and no-income-verification loans.
 
 Get a co-borrower. Excessive indebtedness isn’t the only problem a 
borrower can cure. This may be the perfect time to ask your parents, 
your rich Uncle Dennis, or your buddy who just won the Reader’s Digest 
Sweepstakes to help you.
Credit blemishes
“You can run, but you can’t hide” aptly describes the futility of trying to duck 
creditors. If you have pecuniary problems with the butcher, the baker, or 
the candlestick maker, woe be it to you if you’re ever slow and sloppy when 
paying your bills. Creditors have a nasty way of getting even with you. They 
report your delinquencies and defaults to credit bureaus. These fiscal zits 
deface your record for years to come whenever anyone obtains a copy of 
your credit report.
 
If your credit history is a smidgen less than sparkling, one key element to get-
ting your loan approved is immediate, detailed disclosure of any unfavorable 
information. Don’t play games. Give the lender a complete, written explanation 
of all prior credit problems when you submit the loan application. Financial 
dings tied to one-time predicaments such as serious illness or job loss that 
you’ve satisfactorily surmounted are usually relatively easy to handle.
It pays to take the initiative if you have trouble obtaining a mortgage. Ask 
your loan officer to list all the derogatory items you must rectify in order 
to get loan approval. Instead of wasting your valuable time trying to guess 
what’s wrong, you’ll have a nice, neat (hopefully short) checklist of every-
thing you must correct.
Here are four ways to conquer crummy credit:
 
 Seek sympathetic lenders. Certain financial institutions, called B paper 
lenders, specialize in loans for credit-impaired folks. Their mortgage 
interest rates and loan fees are higher than the rates and fees charged 

43
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
by A paper lenders, who only loan money to people with impeccable 
credit. That’s the price you must pay for past credit improprieties. When 
you interview lenders, don’t be coy. Ask them whether your credit blem-
ishes present a problem.
 
 Depending upon the magnitude of your mess, you may want to secure 
the services of a mortgage broker. Because they often assist people with 
credit problems, mortgage brokers already know which lenders will be 
most understanding about this kind of fiscal frailty. Mortgage brokers 
are typically approved with a number of lenders — and thus have more 
options in placing a mortgage.
 
 Seek seller financing. As we note in Chapter 5, tax advantages and high 
rates of return induce some sellers to offer financing for the buyers of 
their properties. Sellers can be more flexible when dealing with credit 
blemishes than conventional lenders, because they aren’t hampered by 
so many rules and regulations. If you’re financially strong today, a seller 
may be willing to overlook your past credit problems.
 
 Seek a co-borrower. Once again, we suggest trying to obtain the coop-
eration of the ever-popular co-borrower.
 
 Seek savings and spruce up your credit. If the lenders you’ve talked to 
either summarily reject your loan application or offer you outrageous 
loans with stratospherically high interest rates and fees, why rush to 
buy a home? Instead, continue renting. Concentrate on two goals — 
saving money for your down payment and keeping your credit record 
spotless. After a couple of years, lenders will be knocking at your door 
day and night beseeching you to honor them with your business.
Low appraisals
Did you hear the joke about the conscientious fellow who dutifully visited 
his friendly neighborhood dentist for a semi-annual checkup and teeth clean-
ing? After completing her usual meticulous, 15-minute inspection, the dentist 
advised our hero that his teeth passed the exam with flying colors. Then she 
solemnly announced that the poor guy’s gums had to go. Ta da boom!
Believe it or not, this hilarious digression (all right, mildly hilarious) does 
have a point. Suppose you’re a lender’s dream borrower, the embodiment 
of perfection — plenty of cash for a down payment, no indebtedness what-
soever, incredible income, exceptional job security, and nary a spot of 
derogatory information anywhere in your credit history. How could you, a 
Champion of Creditworthiness, ever be turned down for a mortgage?
Simple. Blame the lender’s appraiser, who is of the firmly held opinion that 
the house you’re so madly infatuated with isn’t worth what you so foolishly 
agreed to pay for it. Don’t take it personally. The rejection has nothing to do 
with you as a fine, upstanding individual.

44
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Low appraisals aren’t restricted to transactions involving home purchases; 
they’ve sabotaged their fair share of refinances, too.
Maybe the appraiser is absolutely correct — maybe not. What you do next 
depends upon which of the following five factors provoked the low appraisal:
 
 You overpaid. Hey, it happens. Appraisals rarely come in under the pur-
chase price. You and your real estate agent may be suffering from a case 
of excessive enthusiasm regarding your dream home’s fair market value. 
For example, just because you’re willing to pay $250,000 for it doesn’t 
mean that anyone else in the whole wide world would pay a penny over 
$235,000. Or the appraised value may be low because the house needs a 
The best defense is a great offense
In the American legal system, you’re innocent 
until proven guilty. In the Alice in Wonderland 
financial realm, conversely, you’re guilty until 
credit reporting agencies say that you’re 
innocent.
Credit agencies and the creditors who report 
information to them sometimes make mistakes. 
Most folks don’t discover these errors until 
they’re turned down for a loan.
If that hideous fate befalls you, begin the cor-
rection process by finding the inaccuracy. 
For instance, if the error pertains to a charge 
account that’s not yours, tell the credit bureau 
to remove the derogatory data and put it on the 
correct person’s credit report.
Now suppose that it’s your account. A creditor 
of yours told the credit agency that you never 
paid a bill when, in fact, you actually paid it in 
full long ago. In that case, you must go back to 
the source of the erroneous information and 
have the creditor instruct the credit bureau to 
correct the misinformation.
Fixing this type of error requires persistence 
and patience. Credit bureaus, by law, must 
respond to your inquiry within 30 days. If you 
get the brush-off from frontline customer ser-
vice representatives, demand to speak to their 
manager. If that doesn’t work, file a complaint 
with local government regulatory agencies.
Your best strategy is to have the blemish removed 
from your credit record. If the quarrelsome 
creditor refuses to rectify the inaccuracy, you’re 
allowed to enter a statement of contention in your 
file so future creditors who obtain your credit 
report can read your side of the story.
Obtain a copy of your credit report to ensure 
that the information is accurate. If you’re apply-
ing for a mortgage, ask for a copy of your credit 
report. After all, you’re paying for it.
Once per year, you can obtain a free copy of 
your credit report directly from each of the credit 
bureaus that publish them. Equifax (800-685-1111, 
www.equifax.com), Experian (888-397-3742, 
www.experian.com), and TransUnion 
(800-916-8800, www.transunion.com) 
provide credit reports. So, if you want to keep 
a close watch on your credit reports, you can 
rotate, every four months, which credit bureau 
from which you obtain a free copy. Also know 
that Section 615(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act is a federal law that gives you the right to 
receive a free copy of your credit report from 
the credit bureau if you ask within 60 days of 
being turned down for a loan.

new foundation, a new roof, and other expensive repairs that you didn’t 
factor into your offering price. In either case, be grateful the appraiser 
warned you before you made a costly mistake.
 
 You obviously like the house or you wouldn’t have offered to buy it. 
If, despite the low appraisal, you still want the property, don’t give up. 
Arrange a meeting with the seller. Use the appraisal as a negotiating 
device to reduce the purchase price or to get an offsetting credit for the 
necessary corrective work.
 
 The seller is stuck with the property. You aren’t. If the seller won’t listen 
to reason, don’t waste any more of your valuable time. Instead, move on 
to find your true dream home. Speaking of moving on, getting another 
real estate agent may also be wise if you suspect that your present agent 
is inept or wants you to pay more than the house is worth to fatten his 
own commission check. A good agent’s negotiating skills and knowledge 
of property values can save you thousands of dollars. An incompetent or 
unethical agent can cost you just as many thousands of dollars.
 
 The home you want to buy is located in a declining market. Since late 
2007, lenders imposed loan restrictions on markets they consider risky 
because home prices in those areas are dropping. A high-risk area could 
be as small as a specific zip code or as large as giant chunks of California 
and Florida. If your dream house is located in a declining market area, 
you’ll have to put more cash down and pay higher interest rates and loan 
fees to offset the lender’s increased risk due to falling property values.
 
 Stigmatizing every single property in a zip code or, worse yet, a major 
metropolitan area as risky is a sledgehammer solution to the problem. 
Local neighborhood conditions can and do vary widely within a zip code 
or city. Lenders may make an exception to the dreaded declining market 
designation if your appraisal demonstrates conclusively that property 
values aren’t falling within the specific geographic area where your 
dream house is located.
 
 Prices dropped since you bought your home. This predicament periodi-
cally clobbers folks trying to refinance a loan. Real estate is an excellent 
long-term investment. However, like the stock market, the real estate 
market has short-term boom-and-bust cycles. For instance, suppose you 
paid a record high price several years ago when you acquired your home 
at the pinnacle of a strong (seller’s) market. In our hypothetical situation, 
the country is now mired in a deep recession, and houses like yours are 
selling for far less money. If that actually happens to you, don’t kill the 
messenger for accurately reporting current property values.
 
 Property prices aren’t fixed. They slither all over the place. A house’s 
fair market value (FMV) is based on what buyers offer and sellers 
accept. It’s not a specific number — it’s a price range. To push your 
appraisal toward the high end of FMV, have your real estate agent give 
the appraiser a list of houses comparable to yours in location, condi-
tion, size, and age that sold within the past six months. Unlike good real 

46
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
estate agents, appraisers generally don’t inspect every property on the 
market. If your agent toured all these houses and the appraiser didn’t 
have time to see some of them, your agent should review the properties 
with the appraiser to help the appraiser understand why the highest 
sales are the best comparables.
 
 The appraiser doesn’t know property values in your area. Suppose 
that, while looking for your dream home, you and your agent saw five 
comparable houses (near the home you want to buy) that completely 
justify the price you agreed to pay. If the appraisal comes in low under 
these circumstances, the appraiser may not know neighborhood prop-
erty values.
 
 When you suspect that the appraiser is geographically clueless, get a 
copy of the appraisal from the lender. Check the houses the appraiser 
selected to establish fair market value to see whether they’re actu-
ally valid comparables for the home you want to buy. If they aren’t, 
discuss your concerns with the lender. Find out how many appraisals 
the appraiser has done recently in the neighborhood. If the appraiser 
doesn’t work in the immediate vicinity, the appraiser’s opinions of value 
are suspect. In this situation, some lenders will have the property reap-
praised without charging you.
 
 The lender is redlining. Redlining is the discriminatory act of refusing 
to make loans in specific neighborhoods that a lender considers undesir-
able. Because this practice is illegal, it’s the least likely explanation for a 
low appraisal from a reputable lender.
 
 Request a copy of your appraisal if you suspect redlining. After carefully 
reviewing the comparable sales data to establish that the appraisal is 
unrealistically low based upon your firsthand knowledge of comps, ask 
the lender to explain why. If you’re not satisfied with the explanation or 
if you get the runaround, ask for a full refund of your loan application 
and appraisal fees; then take your business to another lender. You may 
also consider filing a complaint with the appropriate agency in your 
state that regulates mortgage lenders.
Problem properties
Two types of residential property — cooperative apartments and fixer-
uppers — are difficult to get mortgages on. We discuss the intricacies of 
these properties in great detail in Home Buying For Dummies (Wiley). This 
section simply highlights the financing problems associated with these types 
of properties.

47
 Chapter 2: Qualifying for a Mortgage
Cooperative apartments
When you buy a house or a condominium apartment, you get a deed that 
proves you have legal title to the property. Nice and simple, isn’t it?
When you buy a cooperative apartment, usually called a co-op, you get a stock 
certificate, which proves that you own a certain number of shares of stock in 
the cooperative corporation. You also get a proprietary lease, which entitles 
you to occupy the apartment you bought. The cooperative corporation that 
owns the building has the deed in its name. Confusing, isn’t it?
In places such as New York City, where co-ops are common, mortgage financ-
ing on this type of property is readily available. In many other parts of this 
great land, however, lenders find co-ops legally daunting. They don’t make 
co-op loans, because they refuse to accept shares of stock in a cooperative 
corporation as security for a mortgage. Compounding the problem, some 
co-ops won’t permit any individual financing over and above the mortgage 
that the cooperative corporation has on the building as a whole.
 
If only one or two lenders in your area make co-op loans, don’t buy a cooperative 
apartment unless you’re independently wealthy. You’ll likely end up paying a 
higher mortgage interest rate due to limited competition and the lenders’ con-
cerns about the risks involved with co-op financing. Worse, what happens to you 
if these lenders stop making co-op mortgages and no other lenders take their 
place? You won’t be able to sell your unit unless you find an all-cash buyer (rare 
birds, indeed) or you decide to carry the loan for the next buyer.
Fixer-uppers
Fixer-uppers are properties that need work to put them in pristine condition. 
If the house you want to buy only needs cosmetic renovations (painting, 
carpeting, landscaping, and the like), you probably won’t have a big problem 
obtaining a mortgage.
However, suppose the apple of your eye is a house that needs serious struc-
tural repairs, such as a new foundation, a new roof, and the installation of 
new electrical and plumbing systems. We have to question the wisdom of 
buying such a needy property. If your dream house is a corrective-work 
nightmare, getting financing may be tough. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
 
Getting financing is difficult whenever corrective work repairs exceed 3 per-
cent of the property’s value, which is always the case with a major fixer-upper. 
A good real estate agent will know which lenders in your area specialize in 
financing this type of property. If the lender finds you creditworthy and your 
project feasible, the lender will probably give you a mortgage to buy the prop-
erty and a construction loan to make the necessary improvements.

W
hen you apply for a loan, lenders try to determine your credit risk 
level. If they decide to loan you money, what are the odds that you’ll 
pay them back on time? To understand your credit risk, most lenders look at 
your credit score. Your score influences the credit that’s available to you and 
the terms of any mortgage that lenders offer you.
Most lenders also use a number of other facts to make credit decisions. They 
usually look at the amount of debt you can reasonably handle given your 
income, your employment history, and your credit history. Based on their 
perception of this information, as well as their specific underwriting policies, 
lenders may extend credit to you although your score is low, or decline your 
request for credit although your score is high. But your chances for getting 
approved at the best possible loan terms improve when you have a good 
score. This chapter gives you an overview of the importance of your credit 
score when you apply for a mortgage.
Defining Credit Scores
The credit score most lenders use today — a FICO score — was developed by 
Fair Isaac Corporation. FICO scores range from a low of 300 to a maximum of 
850. They’re provided to lenders by the three major credit reporting agencies: 
Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 
 
Understanding your credit score can help you manage your credit health. By 
knowing how lenders evaluate your credit risk, you can take action to lower 
your credit risk — and thus raise your score — over time. A better score may 
mean better loan options for you.

50
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
Although FICO scores are the most commonly used credit risk scores in the 
U.S., lenders may use other scores to evaluate your credit risk. These include
 
 Application risk scores: Many lenders use scoring systems that include 
the FICO score but also consider information from your loan application.
 
 Customer risk scores: A lender may use these scores to make credit 
decisions about its current customers. Also called behavior scores, these 
scores generally consider the FICO score along with information about 
how you’ve paid that lender in the past.
 
 Credit bureau scores: The three major credit bureaus — Equifax, 
Experian, and TransUnion — each have developed their own scoring 
systems. These scores may evaluate your credit report differently than 
FICO scores, and in some cases a higher score may mean more risk, not 
less risk, as with FICO scores. Nonetheless the FICO Score is still the 
gold standard.
Assessing Your Credit History
Your FICO score evaluates your credit report, which is the way most U.S. 
businesses see your credit history. The report details your credit history 
as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by lenders who have 
extended credit to you. Your credit report lists what types of credit you 
use, the length of time your accounts have been open, and whether you’ve 
paid your bills on time. It tells lenders how much credit you’ve used and 
whether you’re seeking new sources of credit. It gives lenders a broader 
view of your credit history than one bank’s own records (unless you drew 
all your previous credit from that one bank).
Your credit report reveals many aspects of your borrowing activities. To give 
you a fair assessment, lenders should consider each piece of information 
on your report in relationship to the other report information. The ability to 
quickly, fairly, and consistently consider all this information is what makes 
credit scoring so useful. This section briefly highlights what information goes 
into your credit report and what you need to regularly check to avoid errors.
 
Expect to pay about $20 to $35 for a lender to obtain a current copy of your 
standard credit report from the credit reporting agencies. A more extensive 
report called a Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RCMR) can cost $50 to 
$75.Chapter 2 tells you how to obtain a free copy of your credit report if you 
want one before applying for a loan.

51
 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
What goes into your credit report
Although each credit reporting agency formats and reports information 
differently, all credit reports contain basically the same kinds of 
information:
 
 Identifying information: Your name, address, Social Security number, 
date of birth, and employment information are used to identify you. 
The agencies don’t use these factors to calculate your score, however. 
Updates to this information come from information you supply to 
lenders.
 
 Trade lines: These are your credit accounts. Lenders report each 
account you’ve established with them. They report the type of account 
(bank card, auto loan, mortgage, and so on), the date you opened the 
account, your credit limit or loan amount, the account balance, and your 
payment history.
 
 Inquiries: When you apply for a loan, you authorize your lender to ask 
for a copy of your credit report. This is how inquiries appear on your 
credit report. The inquiries section contains a list of everyone who 
accessed your credit report within the last two years. The report you 
see lists both voluntary inquiries, spurred by your own requests for 
credit, and involuntary inquires, such as when lenders order your report 
before sending you a preapproved credit offer in the mail.
 
 Public record and collection items: Credit reporting agencies also 
collect public record information from state and county courts, and 
information on overdue debt from collection agencies. Public record 
information includes bankruptcies, foreclosures, suits, wage 
attachments, liens, and judgments.
Along with the credit report, lenders can also buy a credit score based on the 
information in the report.
Check your credit report
If your credit report contains errors, the report may be incomplete or contain 
information about someone else. This typically happens because:
 
 You applied for credit under slightly different names (Robert Jones, Bob 
Jones, and so on).
 
 Someone made a clerical error in reading or entering name or address 
information from a handwritten application.

52
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
 Someone gave an inaccurate Social Security number, or the lender 
misread the number.
 
 Loan or credit card payments were inadvertently applied to the wrong 
account.
 
If you find an error, the credit reporting agency must investigate and 
respond to you within 30 days. If you’re in the process of applying for a 
loan, immediately notify your lender in writing of any incorrect information 
in your report. In Chapter 2 we tell you how to contact the credit reporting 
agencies to obtain and fix your credit report.
Understanding How Scores Work
Each credit score is calculated by a mathematical equation that evaluates many 
types of information from your credit report at that agency. By comparing this 
information to the patterns in hundreds of thousands of past credit reports, the 
score identifies your level of estimated future credit risk.
In order for a FICO score to be calculated from your credit report, the report 
must contain at least one account that’s been open for six months or longer. 
In addition, the report must contain at least one account that’s been updated 
in the past six months. This ensures enough recent information is in your 
report to calculate a score.
Your score can change whenever your credit report changes. But your 
score probably won’t change a lot from one month to the next. In a given 
three-month time period, only about one in four people has a 20-point 
change in her credit score.
 
Although a bankruptcy or late payment can quickly lower your score, improv-
ing your score takes time. That’s why it’s a good idea to check your score 
(especially if you have reason to be concerned about your credit history) at 
least six months before applying for a mortgage. That gives you time to take 
corrective action if needed. If you’re actively working to improve your score, 
you should check it quarterly or even monthly to review changes.
The higher your FICO score, the lower the potential risk you pose for lenders. 
But no score says whether you’ll be a “good” or “bad” customer. Although 
many lenders use FICO scores to help them make lending decisions, each 
lender also has its own strategy, including the level of risk it finds acceptable 
for a given credit product. There is no single minimum score used by all 
lenders.

53
 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
FICO scores can differ between bureaus
Fair Isaac makes the FICO scores as consistent as possible among the three 
credit reporting agencies. If your information is exactly identical at all 
three credit reporting agencies, your scores from all three should be within 
a few points of each other.
But sometimes your FICO score may be quite different at each of the three 
credit reporting agencies. The way lenders and other businesses report 
information to the credit reporting agencies sometimes results in different 
information being in your credit report at two or more of the agencies. The 
agencies may also report the same information in different ways. Even small 
differences in the information at the three credit reporting agencies can 
affect your scores.
 
Because lenders may review your score and credit report from any one of the 
three credit reporting agencies, go ahead and check your credit report at all three 
to make sure each is correct (see Chapter 2 for instructions on how to do that).
What a FICO score considers
The FICO score evaluates five main categories of information. Some, as you’d 
expect, are more important than others. It’s important to note the following:
 
 A score considers all these categories of information, not just one or 
two. No one piece of information or factor alone determines your score.
 
 The importance of any factor depends on the overall information 
in your credit report. A given factor may be more important for some 
people than for others who have a different credit history. In addition, as 
the information in your credit report changes, so does the importance of 
any factor in determining your score. That’s why it’s impossible to say 
exactly how important any single factor is in determining your score — 
even the levels of importance shown in the following subsections are for 
the general population, and differ for different credit profiles.
 
 Your FICO score looks only at information in your credit report. When 
making a credit decision, lenders often also look at other things, including 
your income, how long you’ve worked at your present job, and the kind of 
credit you’re requesting.
 
 Your score considers both positive and negative information in your 
credit report. Late payments lower your score, but establishing or reestab-
lishing a good track record of making payments on time raises your score.
 
 Raising your score is a bit like getting in shape. It takes time, and there 
is no quick fix. In fact, quick-fix efforts can backfire. The best advice is to 
manage credit responsibly over time. Try to never be even one day late 
with your mortgage payment.

54
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
The percentages we give you in the following sections are based on the 
importance of the five categories for the general population. For particular 
groups — for example, people who haven’t been using credit for very long — 
the importance of these categories may be different.
The following sections offer a complete look at the information that goes into 
a FICO score. For a visual graphic of what contributes to your credit score, 
see Figure 3-1.

Your payment history
What’s your track record for repaying creditors? One of the most important 
factors in a credit score is your payment history; it affects roughly 35 percent 
of your score. The first thing any lender wants to know is whether you’ve 
paid past credit accounts on time.
Late payments aren’t an automatic “score-killer.” An overall good credit picture 
can outweigh one or two instances of, say, late credit card payments. And on 
the other hand, having no late payments in your credit report doesn’t mean you 
automatically get a great score. Some 60 to 65 percent of credit reports show no 
late payments at all. Your payment history is just one piece of information used 
in calculating your score.
In the area of payments, your score takes into account:
 
 Payment information on many types of accounts: These types of 
accounts include credit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, American 
Express, and Discover, credit cards from stores where you do business, 
installment loans (loans such as a mortgage on which you make regular 
payments), and finance company accounts.
 
 Public record and collection items: These items include reports of events 
such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, suits, wage attachments, liens, and 
judgments. They’re considered quite serious, although older items and 
items with small amounts count less than more recent items or those with 

55
 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
larger amounts. Bankruptcies stay on your credit report for 7 to 10 years, 
depending on the type.
 
 Details on late or missed payments (delinquencies) and public record 
and collection items: The FICO score considers how late such payments 
were, how much you owed, how recently they occurred, and how many 
you have. As a rule, a 60-day late payment isn’t as damaging as a 90-day 
late payment. A 60-day late payment made just a month ago, however, 
penalizes you more than a 90-day late payment from five years ago.
 
 How many accounts show no late payments: A good track record on 
most of your credit accounts increases your credit score.
 
So how do you improve your FICO score? Consider the possibilities:
 
 Pay your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections can have a 
major negative impact on your score.
 
 If you’ve missed payments, get current and stay current. The longer 
you pay your bills on time, the better your score.
 
 Paying off or closing an account doesn’t remove it from your credit 
report. The score still considers this information, because it reflects 
your past credit pattern.
 
 If you’re having trouble making ends meet, get help. This step doesn’t 
improve your score immediately, but if you can begin to manage your 
credit and pay on time, your score gets better over time. See Chapter 2 
for credit problem-solving strategies.
Amount you owe
About 30 percent of your score is based on your current debt. Having credit 
accounts and owing money on them doesn’t mean you’re a high-risk borrower 
who’ll receive a low score. However, owing a great deal of money on many 
accounts can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to make 
some payments late or not at all. Part of the science of scoring is determining 
how much is too much for a given credit profile.
In the area of debts, your score takes into account:
 
 The amount owed on all accounts. Note that even if you pay off your 
credit cards in full every month, your credit report may show a balance 
on those cards. The total balance on your last statement is generally the 
amount that will show in your credit report.
 
 The amount owed on all accounts and on different types of accounts. 
In addition to the overall amount you owe, the score considers the 
amount you owe on specific types of accounts, such as credit cards and 
installment loans.

56
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
 Whether you show a balance on certain types of accounts. In some 
cases, having a small balance without missing a payment shows that 
you’ve managed credit responsibly. On the other hand, closing unused 
credit accounts that show zero balances and that are in good standing 
doesn’t raise your score.
 
 How many accounts have balances. A large number can indicate higher 
risk of overextension.
 
 How much of the total credit line you’re using on credit cards and 
other revolving credit accounts. Someone closer to “maxing out” on 
many credit cards may have trouble making payments in the future.
 
 How much of installment loan accounts is still owed, compared with 
the original loan amounts. For example, if you borrowed $10,000 to buy 
a car and you’ve paid back $2,000, you owe (with interest) more than 
80 percent of the original loan. Paying down installment loans is a good 
sign that you’re able and willing to manage and repay debt.
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
 Keep balances low on credit cards and other revolving credit. High 
outstanding debt can adversely affect a score.
 
 Pay off debt. The most effective way to improve your score in this area 
is by paying down your revolving credit.
 
 Don’t close unused credit cards as a short-term strategy to raise your 
score. Generally, this tactic doesn’t work. In fact, it may lower your 
score. Late payments associated with old accounts won’t disappear 
from your credit report if you close the account. Long-established 
accounts show you have a longer history of managing credit, which is a 
good thing. And having available credit that you don’t use doesn’t lower 
your score. You may have reasons other than your score to shut down 
old credit card accounts that you don’t use. But don’t do it in hopes of 
getting a better score.
 
 Don’t open new credit cards that you don’t need, just to increase your 
available credit. This approach can backfire and actually lower your score.
Length of credit history
How established is your credit history? About 15 percent of your score is 
based on this area. In general, a longer credit history increases your score. 
However, even people who haven’t been using credit long may get high 
scores, depending on how the rest of the credit report looks.
In this area, your score takes into account:
 
 How long your credit accounts have been established, in general. The 
score considers both the age of your oldest account and an average age 
of all your accounts.

57
 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
 
 How long specific credit accounts have been established.
 
 How long it’s been since you used certain accounts.
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
 If you’ve been managing credit for a short time, don’t open a lot of 
new accounts too rapidly. New accounts lower your average account 
age, which will have a larger effect on your score if you don’t have a lot 
of other credit information. Also, rapid account buildup can look risky if 
you’re a new credit user.
New credit
Taking on a lot of new debt affects your score, too. About 10 percent of your 
score is based on new credit and credit applications.
 
People tend to have more credit today and to shop for credit — via the 
Internet and other channels — more frequently than ever. Credit scores reflect 
this fact. However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a 
short period does represent more risk — especially for people who don’t have 
a long-established credit history.
Applying for several new credit cards or accounts also represents more risk. 
However, FICO scores do a good job of distinguishing between a search for 
many new credit accounts and rate shopping for one new account.
In the area of new credit, your score takes into account:
 
 How many new accounts you have. The score looks at how many new 
accounts you have by type of account (for example, how many newly 
opened credit cards you have). It also may look at how many of your 
accounts are new accounts.
 
 How long it’s been since you opened a new account. Again, the score 
looks at this info by type of account.
 
 How many recent requests for credit you’ve made. This is indicated 
by inquiries to the credit reporting agencies. Inquiries remain on your 
credit report for two years, although FICO scores consider inquiries only 
from the last 12 months. The scores have been carefully designed to 
count only those inquiries that truly impact credit risk.
 
 Length of time since lenders made credit report inquiries. The older 
the lender inquiries, the better. Inquiries more than a year old are 
ignored. In this case, being ignored is good.
 
 Whether you have a good recent credit history, following past payment 
problems. Reestablishing credit and making payments on time after a 
period of late payment behavior helps to raise a score over time.

58
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
 Do your rate shopping for a specific loan within a focused period of 
time. FICO scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and 
a search for many new credit lines, in part by the length of time over 
which inquiries occur. For more on this topic, see the section “Adding 
up inquiries” later in the chapter.
 
 Reestablish your credit history if you’ve had problems. Opening new 
accounts responsibly and paying them off on time will raise your score 
in the long term.
 
 It’s okay to request and check your own credit report and FICO 
score. This doesn’t affect your score, as long as you order your credit 
report directly from the credit reporting agency or through an 
organization authorized to provide credit reports to consumers, such 
as www.myFICO.com.
Types of credit in use
The credit mix usually isn’t a key factor in determining your score — but it’s 
given more weight if your credit report doesn’t have a lot of other information 
on which to base a score. About 10 percent of your score is based on this 
category.
In this area, your score takes into account:
 
 What kinds of credit accounts you have. Your score considers your 
mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company 
accounts, and mortgage loans. Don’t feel obligated to have one of each.
 
 How many of each type of credit account you have. The score looks 
at the total number of accounts you have. How many is too many varies 
depending on the credit type. You don’t need to have one of each type. 
Don’t open credit accounts you don’t intend to use just to hype up your 
total.
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
 Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Don’t open 
accounts just to have a better credit mix — it probably won’t raise your 
score.
 
 Have credit cards — but manage them responsibly. In general, having 
two to three credit cards and installment loans (and making timely 
payments) raises your score.
 
 Note that closing an account doesn’t make it go away. A closed 
account still shows up on your credit report and may be included in the 
score.

59
 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
Adding up inquiries
A search for new credit can mean greater credit risk. This is why the FICO 
score counts inquiries — those requests a lender makes for your credit 
report or score when you apply for credit.
FICO scores consider inquiries very carefully because not all inquiries are 
related to credit risk. You should note three things about credit inquiries:
 
 Inquiries don’t affect scores very much. For most people, one additional 
credit inquiry takes less than 5 points off their FICO score. However, 
inquiries can have a greater impact if you have few accounts or a short 
credit history. Large numbers of inquiries also mean greater risk: People 
with six inquiries or more on their credit reports are eight times more 
likely to declare bankruptcy than people with no inquiries on their 
reports.
The lowdown on how a foreclosure can affect your 
FICO score
A foreclosure, a short sale (where the lender 
agrees to accept less than the total amount due 
on a mortgage), or a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
(in which a borrower deeds his property to 
the lender, who then sells it and uses the 
proceeds of sale to repay the mortgage) lowers 
your credit score. If you had the misfortune to 
personally go through one of these negative credit 
events, be advised they’re considered extremely 
serious delinquencies. They show that you 
failed to honor a credit obligation. Because of 
limitations in the way this type of delinquency is 
shown on credit reports, a FICO score generally 
doesn’t distinguish among them.
The FICO score assesses negatives on your 
credit report by three factors:
  Recency (how long ago)
  Severity (how late)
  Frequency (how often)
A foreclosure is serious because you became 
so late in making your monthly payments 
(severity) that your lender terminates the loan. 
Its impact on your credit score increases if the 
event was reported a short time ago (recency) 
or if other items on your credit report are also 
delinquent (frequency).
How can you improve your FICO score after a 
foreclosure? Typically, a foreclosure adversely 
affects your credit report for up to seven years. 
Because your payment history comprises about 
35 percent of your credit score, the best way 
to improve your FICO score is to get current 
and stay current on all your other payment 
obligations.
Even with an improved FICO score, however, 
don’t expect to get a new home loan with 
favorable terms for five to seven years after 
your foreclosure. In 2008 both the Federal 
National Mortgage Association (Fannie 
Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (Freddie Mac), the two largest 
sources of mortgage money in the U.S., gave 
lenders strict new guidelines for handling loan 
applications from folks who’ve experienced a 
foreclosure. (We’ve devoted Chapter 13 entirely 
to foreclosures.)

Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
 
 Many kinds of inquiries aren’t counted at all. When you order your 
credit report or credit score from a credit reporting agency, the score 
doesn’t count it. Also, the score doesn’t count requests a lender makes 
for your credit report or score in order to make you a preapproved 
credit offer, or to review your account with them, even though you may 
see these inquiries on your credit report. Requests that are marked as 
coming from employers aren’t counted either.
 
 The score looks for rate shopping. Looking for a mortgage or an auto loan 
may cause multiple lenders to request your credit report, even though 
you’re looking for only one loan. To compensate for this reality, the score 
counts multiple inquiries in any 14-day period as just one inquiry. In addi-
tion, the score ignores all inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring. So 
if you find a loan within 30 days, the inquiries won’t affect your score while 
you’re rate shopping.
What FICO scores ignore
FICO scores consider a wide range of information on your credit report. 
However, they don’t consider:
 
 Your race, color, religion, national origin, sex, and marital status
 
 U.S. law prohibits credit scoring from considering these facts, as well as 
any receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any consumer right 
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
 
 Your age
 
 Your salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed, or employment 
history
Lenders may consider this information, however:
 
 Where you live and how long you’ve lived there
 
 Any interest rate being charged on a particular credit card or other 
account
 
 Any items reported as child/family support and divorce obligations or 
rental agreements
 
 Certain types of inquiries (requests for your credit report or score)
 
 The score does not count any requests you make, any requests from 
employers, and any requests lenders make without your knowledge.
 
 Any information not found in your credit report, including your current 
salary and occupation
 
 Any information not proven to be predictive of future credit performance

 Chapter 3: Scoping Out Your Credit Score
Interpreting scores
When a lender receives your FICO score, up to four score reasons are also 
delivered. These are the top reasons why your score isn’t higher. If the 
lender rejects your request for credit and your FICO score is part of the 
reason, these score reasons can help the lender tell you why.
 
These score reasons can be more useful to you than the score itself. They help 
you determine whether your credit report may contain errors, and how you 
may improve your credit score. However, if you already have a high FICO score 
(for example, in the mid-700s or higher) some of the reasons may not be help-
ful because they may be marginal factors related to less important categories 
such as your length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit in use.
Getting your score
 
Because lenders check your score, you may want to see the same score that 
they see. It’s easy to check your FICO score and to find out specific things that 
you can do to raise it. The Web sites for many banks, financial services sites, 
and credit reporting agencies offer FICO scores for a fee, as does Fair Isaac’s 
myFICO site at www.myFICO.com. Information you receive includes:
 
 Your current FICO score
 
 Your credit report on which your FICO score is based
 
 An explanation of your score, the positive and negative factors behind it, 
and how lenders view your credit risk
 
 A FICO score simulator you can use to see how specific actions, such as 
paying off all your card balances, would affect your score
 
 Specific tips on what you can do to improve your FICO score over time
In addition, you can see current information on the average interest rates for 
home loans for different FICO score ranges.
Managing your score
Follow the tips in this chapter to manage your credit score efficiently. 
Improving your score can help you:
 
 Get better credit offers
 
 Lower your interest rates
 
 Speed up credit approvals

62
Part I: Fine-Tuning Your Finances 
An important time to check your score is six months or more before applying 
for a mortgage. This gives you time to make sure your credit report information 
is right, correct it if it’s not, improve your score if necessary, and ensure your 
access to the best mortgages available.
 
If you’ve been turned down for credit, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act (ECOA) gives you the right to find out why within 30 days. You’re also 
entitled to a free copy of your credit bureau report within 60 days, which 
you can request from the credit reporting agencies. If your FICO score was a 
primary part of the lender’s decision, the lender will use the score reasons to 
explain why you didn’t qualify for the credit.

L
ike brain surgeons, nuclear physicists, pizza makers, and all other 
highly skilled professionals, financial wizards have developed their 
own weird customs, practices, and terminology over the centuries. If you 
want to do business with financiers, knowing how to speak their language 
helps, because they rarely bother to speak yours. A steady diet of jumbo 
loan a la negative amortization with points au gratin on the side and the 
infamous house specialty, prepayment penalty flambé, for dessert leaves 
even the hardiest borrower intellectually constipated.
Worse, some unscrupulous lenders may use your fiscal ignorance to maneuver 
you into getting a loan that’s good for them but bad for you. Even though an 
assortment of loans may outwardly appear to be equally attractive, they’re 
usually not — not by a looooooooooong shot. Chapter 5 takes you through the 
particulars of choosing the best loan for you.
The good news is that lending ain’t rocket science. This chapter explains what 
makes a loan tick and helps you speak the language of lending like a pro.
Grasping Loan Basics: Principal, 
Interest, Term, and Amortization
Money isn’t magical. It’s a consumer product like TVs, toasters, and toilet 
paper. Lending institutions such as banks, savings and loan associations (S & 
Ls), and credit unions get their raw material (money) in the form of deposits 
from millions of people just like you. Then they bundle your cash into neat 
little packages called loans, which they sell to other folks who use the money 

66
Part II: Locating a Loan 
to buy cars, college educations, and cottages. Lenders make their profit on 
the spread (differential) between what they pay depositors to get money and 
what they charge borrowers for it.
 
What you purchase with the money you borrow is immaterial. All loans have 
the following four basic components:
 
 Principal: Even though both words are spelled and pronounced the 
same way, the principal we’re referring to isn’t that humorless old coot 
who ruled your high school with an iron fist. We’re talking about a sum 
of money owed as a debt: the loot you borrow to acquire whatever it is 
that your heart desires.
 
 Interest: No linguistic confusion here — interest is what lenders charge 
you to use their money. It accumulates over time on the unpaid 
balance of money you borrowed and is expressed as a percentage called 
the interest rate. For instance, you may be paying an interest rate of 19.8 
percent or more on the unpaid balance of your credit card debt. (We 
recommend that you pay it off as soon as possible!)
 
 Consumer interest for outstanding balances such as credit card debt 
and a car loan is not deductible on your federal or state income tax 
return. Interest paid on a home loan, conversely, can be used to reduce 
your state and federal income tax burdens. Understanding these income 
tax write-off rules can save you big bucks.
 
 Term: All good things come to an end sooner or later. A loan’s term is 
the amount of time you’re given by a lender to repay money you borrow. 
Generally speaking, small loans have shorter terms than large loans. 
For instance, your friendly neighborhood savings and loan association 
may give you only four years to pay back a $20,000 car loan. That very 
same S & L will graciously fund a loan with a 30-year term so that you 
have plenty of time to repay the $200,000 you borrow to buy your dream 
home.
 
 Lenders allow more time to pay back large loans in order to make the 
monthly payments more affordable. For example, you’d spend $734 a 
month to repay a $100,000 loan with an 8-percent interest rate and a 
30-year term. The same loan costs $956 a month with a 15-year term. 
Even though the 15-year loan’s payment is $222 per month higher, you’d 
pay far less interest on it over the life of the loan:
 
 $956/month × 180 months for a $100,000 loan repayment = $72,080 
in interest over 15 years
 
 versus
 
 $734/month × 360 months for a $100,000 loan repayment = $164,240 
interest over 30 years
 
 Don’t let a low monthly payment (with a longer-term loan) fool you into 
paying a lot more interest over the long haul.

67
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
 
 Amortization: Amortization is a $64 word lenders use to describe the 
tedious process of liquidating a debt by making periodic installment 
payments throughout the loan’s term. Loans are amortized (repaid) with 
monthly payments consisting primarily of interest during the early years 
of the loan term and principal, which the lender uses to reduce the loan’s 
balance. If your loan is fully amortized, it will be repaid in full by the time 
you’ve made your final loan payment. You’ll gasp in astonishment when 
you read Appendix B and see with your own eyes how long it takes to 
repay half of the original loan amount.
Deciphering Mortgage Lingo
Just for the heck of it, ask the next thousand people you meet what a mortgage 
is. Approximately 999 of them will tell you that it’s a loan used to buy a home. 
Impolite oafs will add with an unbecoming sneer that you’re a brain-dead idiot 
for not knowing such an elementary fact. Polite folks will gaze at you pityingly 
while thinking exactly what the discourteous ones told you.
Amazingly, every one of them is wrong. Common usage aside, a mortgage is 
not simply a loan, and we know for certain that you’re not a brain-dead idiot. 
This section clarifies what a mortgage is and isn’t.
So . . . what’s a mortgage?
Mortgage is a word lenders use to describe a formidable pile of legal documents 
you have to sign to get the money you need to buy or refinance real property. 
What’s real property? It’s dirt — plain old terra firma and any improvements 
(homes, garages, tool sheds, barns, or other buildings) permanently attached 
to the land.
Mortgages aren’t used only to facilitate home purchases. They’re used whenever 
people acquire any kind of real property, from vacant lots to commercial real 
estate such as shopping centers and the Empire State Building.
 
In case you’re curious, anything that isn’t real property is classified as 
personal property. Moveable or impermanent possessions such as stoves, 
refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, garbage compactors, 
drapes, carpets, chandeliers, and fireplace screens are examples of personal 
property items that are frequently included in the sale of real property.
Mortgages encumber (burden) real property by making it security for the 
repayment of a debt. A first mortgage ever so logically describes the very first 
loan secured by a particular piece of property. The second loan secured by the 
same property is called a second mortgage, the third loan is a third mortgage, and 

68
Part II: Locating a Loan 
so on. You may also hear lenders refer to a first mortgage as the senior mortgage. 
Any subsequent loans are called junior mortgages. Money imitates life.
This type of financial claim on real property is called a lien. Proper liens 
invariably have two integral parts:
 
 Promissory note: This note is the evidence of your debt, an IOU that 
specifies exactly how much money you borrowed as well as the terms 
and conditions under which you promise to repay it.
 
 Security instrument: If you don’t keep your promise, the security 
instrument gives your lender the right to take steps necessary to have 
your property sold in order to satisfy the debt. The legal process 
triggered by the security device is called foreclosure. We sincerely and 
fervently hope that the closest you ever get to foreclosure is reading 
about it in this book (see Chapter 13 for more details).
From a lender’s perspective, each junior mortgage (subsequent mortgage 
after the first loan on the property) is increasingly risky, because in the 
event of a foreclosure, mortgages are paid off in order of their numerical 
priority (seniority). In plain English, the second mortgage lender doesn’t get 
one cent until the first mortgage lender has been paid in full. If a foreclosure 
sale doesn’t generate enough money to pay off the first mortgage, that’s 
tough luck for the second lender. Due to the added risk, lenders charge 
higher interest rates for junior mortgages.
How to scrutinize security instruments
The security instrument used in your transaction can vary from one state to the 
next depending upon where the property you’re financing is located. Mortgages 
and deeds of trust are the most common types of security instruments. Without 
further ado, we give you some important information about them.
Mortgages as security instruments
As a legal concept, mortgages have been around centuries longer than deeds 
of trust, their relatively newfangled siblings. That’s why folks nearly always 
refer to real property loans as mortgages even if they live in places such as 
California, Texas, Washington, or any other state where a deed of trust is the 
dominant security instrument. Thirty-one states currently use mortgages as 
security instruments. The other 19 states, plus the District of Columbia and 
the Virgin Islands, use deeds of trust.
The seniority of mortgages explains why they’re the prevalent security 
instrument in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and other states east of 
the Mississippi River, the first part of the country to be settled. Check with 
your real estate agent or lender to find out which kind of security instrument 
is used where your property is located.

69
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
Here’s how mortgages operate:
 
 Type of instrument: A mortgage is a written contract that specifies how 
your real property will be used as security for a loan without actually 
delivering possession of the property to your lender.
 
 Parties: A mortgage has two parties — the mortgagor (that’s you, the 
borrower) and the mortgagee (the lending institution). You don’t get a 
mortgage from the lender. On the contrary, you give the lender a mort-
gage on your property. In return, the mortgage holder (lender) loans you 
the money you need to purchase the property.
 
 Title: Title refers to the rights of ownership you have in the property. A 
mortgage requires no transfer of title. You keep full title to your property.
 
 Effect on title: The mortgage creates a lien against your property in 
favor of the lending institution. If you don’t repay your loan, the lender 
usually has to go to court to force payment of your debt by instituting a 
foreclosure lawsuit. If the judge approves the lender’s case against you, 
the lender is given permission to hold a foreclosure sale and sell your 
property to the highest bidder.
Deeds of trust as security instruments
Mortgages and deeds of trust are both used for exactly the same purpose: 
They make real property security for money you borrow. However, mortgages 
and deeds of trust use significantly different methods to accomplish that end. 
The following list highlights the features of a deed of trust:
 
 Type of instrument: The security given isn’t a written contract. It’s a 
special kind of deed called a trust deed.
 
 Parties: The trust deed involves three parties: a trustor (you, the borrower), 
a beneficiary (the lender), and a trustee (a neutral third party such as a title 
insurance company or lawyer who won’t show any favoritism to you or the 
lender).
 
 Title: The trust deed conveys your property’s naked (blush) legal title to 
the trustee, who holds it in trust until you repay your loan. Don’t worry, 
dear reader; you retain possession of the property. Your lender holds 
the actual trust deed and note as evidence of the debt.
 
 Effect on title: Like a mortgage, a trust deed creates a lien against your 
property. Unlike a mortgage, however, the lender doesn’t have to go 
to court to foreclose on your property. In most states, the trustee has 
power of sale, which can be exercised if you don’t satisfy the terms 
and conditions of your loan. The lender simply gives the trustee 
written notice of your default, and then asks the trustee to follow the 
foreclosure procedure specified by the deed of trust and state law. 
Most lenders prefer having their loans secured by a deed of trust. 
Compared to a mortgage, the foreclosure process is much faster and 
less expensive.

70
Part II: Locating a Loan 
For simplicity’s sake, we use mortgage, deed of trust, and the loan you get to 
buy a home as interchangeable terms. You, however, must promise us that 
you’ll always remember the difference and who explained it to you!
Eyeing Classic Mortgage Jargon Duets
Just because you can speak mortgage fluently doesn’t mean that you’ll 
be able to communicate with lenders. The following sections offer more 
essential loan jargon. Consider these dynamic duos: mortgage loan 
options such as fixed or adjustable rate, government or conventional, 
primary or secondary, conforming or jumbo, and long- or short-term.
Fixed or adjustable loans
FRM, ARM, GPM, or whatever — don’t let the alphabet soup of mortgages 
available today confuse you. No matter how complicated the names sound, 
all loans fall into one of the following basic classifications:
 
 Fixed: This type of loan either has an interest rate or a monthly payment 
that never changes. A fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) is just what it claims to 
be — a mortgage that keeps the same interest rate throughout the life of 
the loan.
 
 Even though you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly payment 
may vary if you have an impound account. In addition to the monthly 
loan payment, some lenders collect additional money each month 
(from folks who put less than 20 percent cash down when purchasing 
their homes) for the prorated monthly cost of property taxes and 
homeowner’s insurance. The extra money is put into an impound 
account by the lender, who uses it to pay the borrower’s property 
taxes and homeowners insurance premiums when they’re due. If either 
the property tax or the insurance premium happens to change, the 
borrower’s monthly payment is adjusted accordingly.
 
 Adjustable: Either the interest rate or the monthly payment or both 
interest rate and monthly payment change (adjust) with this kind of 
loan. The following are examples of adjustable mortgages:
 
• An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a loan whose interest rate can 
vary during the loan’s term.
 
• A hybrid loan merges an FRM and an ARM. The hybrid loan’s 
interest rate and monthly payment are fixed for a specific period 
of time, such as five years, and then the mortgage converts into 
an ARM for the remainder of the loan term.

71
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
 
• A graduated-payment mortgage (GPM) combines a fixed interest rate 
with monthly payments that gradually increase by predetermined 
increments during the early years of the loan and then level off.
 
Just because a mortgage’s monthly payment is fixed doesn’t mean that the 
loan is a good one. For instance, some ARMs have monthly payments that 
don’t change even though the loan’s interest rate can vary wildly. This fixed 
monthly payment can lead to negative amortization, an awful situation where 
the loan balance increases every month even though you faithfully make the 
monthly loan payments. After the subprime crisis, very few lenders offer 
negative amortization loans. You can find an in-depth analysis of ARMs and 
negative amortization in Chapter 5. For now, be advised that we strongly urge 
you to avoid loans that have the potential for negative amortization.
Government or conventional loans
Uncle Sam is a major player in the residential mortgage market. Roughly one 
out of five home loans is either insured or guaranteed by an agency of the 
federal government. These mortgages are called, you guessed it, government 
loans. The remaining 80 percent of residential mortgages originated in the 
United States are referred to as conventional loans.
Here’s a quick recap of government loans:
 
 Federal Housing Administration (FHA): The FHA was established in 
1934 during the depths of the Great Depression to stimulate the U.S. 
housing market. It helps low-to-moderate income folks get mortgages 
by issuing federal insurance against losses to lenders who make FHA 
loans. The FHA is not a moneylender. Borrowers must find an FHA-
approved lender such as an S & L, bank, or other conventional lending 
institution willing to grant a mortgage that the FHA then insures. Not 
all commercial lenders choose to participate in FHA loan programs due 
to their complexities.
 
 Depending on which county within the U.S. the home you want to buy 
is located, you may be able to get an FHA-insured loan of up to $729,750 
with as little as 3 percent cash down. Congress passed The Economic 
Stimulus Act of 2008 (The Act), which temporarily raised FHA loan limits 
for single-family homes up to 125 percent of an area’s median home 
price. The minimum loan amount under this program is $271,050 with a 
$729,750 maximum. The operative word is temporarily. The Act expires 
December 31, 2008 unless Congress votes to extend it. Check with your 
lender regarding the current status of this loan program. (For current, 
up-to-date lending limits, visit the FHA Mortgage Limits Web page at 
www.fhaoutreach.com.)

72
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): Congress passed the Serviceman’s 
Readjustment Act, commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights, in 1944. 
One of its provisions enables the VA to help eligible people on active 
duty and veterans buy primary residences. Like the FHA, the VA has no 
money of its own. It guarantees loans granted by conventional lending 
institutions that participate in VA mortgage programs.
 
 Farmers Home Administration (FmHA): Like the FHA and VA, the 
FmHA isn’t a direct lender. Despite its name, you don’t have to be a 
farmer to get a Farmers Home Administration loan. You do, however, 
have to buy a home in the sticks. The FmHA insures mortgages granted 
by participating lenders to qualified buyers who live in rural areas.
 
FHA, VA, and FmHA mortgages have more attractive features — little or no 
cash-down payments, long loan terms, no penalties if you repay your loan 
early, and lower interest rates — than conventional mortgages. However, 
these loans aren’t for everyone. Government loans are targeted for specific 
types of homebuyers, have maximum mortgage amounts established by 
Congress, and may require an inordinately long time to obtain loan approval 
and funding. In a hot market where homes generate multiple offers, buyers 
using government loans almost always lose out to people utilizing 
conventional mortgages that can be funded quicker.
Primary or secondary mortgage market
Lenders make loans directly to folks like you in what’s called the primary 
mortgage market. Few lending institutions keep mortgages they originate 
in vaults surrounded by heavily armed guards. Lenders sell most of their 
mortgages to pension funds, insurance companies, and other private 
investors as well as certain government agencies in the secondary mortgage 
market. Why do mortgage lenders sell mortgages they originate? They want 
to make a profit and to obtain more funds to lend.
The ubiquitous Uncle Sam is an extremely important force in the secondary 
mortgage market through two federally chartered government organizations — 
the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae to smarties 
like you) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, endearingly 
known as Freddie Mac). One of the primary missions of Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac is to stimulate residential housing construction and home purchases by 
pumping money into the secondary mortgage market.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac boost home purchases and construction by 
purchasing loans from conventional lenders and reselling them to private 
investors. These government programs are far and away the two largest 
investors in U.S. mortgages. Loan purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac annually account for well over 20 percent of total U.S. mortgage funds.

73
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
These programs aren’t meant to subsidize rich folks. To that end, Congress 
establishes upper limits on mortgages Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are 
authorized to purchase. Table 4-1 shows the 2008 maximum mortgage 
amounts for one- to four-unit properties.

Congress readjusts these maximum mortgage amounts annually to reflect 
changes in the prevailing average price of property. Any good lender can fill 
you in on Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s current loan limits.
Conforming or jumbo loans
This delicious tidbit of information can save you big bucks: Conventional 
mortgages that fall within Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s loan limits are 
referred to as conforming loans. Mortgages that exceed the maximum per-
missible loan amounts are called jumbo conforming loans, jumbo loans, or 
nonconforming loans.
When Congress passed The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (The Act), it also 
temporarily created a brand-new type of mortgage neatly notched between 
a conforming loan and a jumbo loan. For the moment, we have three tiers of 
mortgages:
 
 True conforming loans include loan amounts up to $417,000. These 
loans, also called traditional conforming loans, have the lowest interest 
rates.
 
 Jumbo conforming loans (like jumbo shrimp, a charming oxymoron) 
encompass loan amounts from $417,000 to $729,750. Some lenders 
call these conforming jumbos, super conforming, or jumbo light loans. 
Whatever. Loans of this size generally have interest rates anywhere 
from half a percent to a full percent (or more) higher than the true 
conforming loan.
 
 True jumbos are loans that exceed $729,750. As you’d expect, the largest 
loans are also the most expensive. Their interest rates usually run a full 
percent point or more above jumbo conforming loans.

74
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both imposed tougher qualifying standards on 
jumbo conforming loans than they have for true conforming loans. Some 
examples of these tougher standards: Jumbo conforming loans are limited to 
single-family dwellings, require that you have at least a 700 FICO score if your 
loan-to-value ratio (LTV) exceeds 75 percent (for Freddie Mac) or 80 percent 
(for Fannie Mae), and specify that monthly payments on your combined total 
debt can’t exceed 45 percent of your income.
Fannie’s and Freddie’s jumbo conforming loan programs are scheduled to 
expire December 31, 2008 unless Congress votes to extent The Act. Be sure to 
check with your lender regarding the current status of these loans.
You pay dearly for nonconformity. The higher the loan amount, the bigger 
the thud if your loan goes belly up. Reducing the loan-to-value ratio is one 
way lenders cut their risk. To that end, conventional lenders generally insist 
on more than the usual 20 percent down on jumbo loans over $750,000. You’ll 
probably be required to make at least a 25-percent cash down payment. 
Interest rates on nonconforming fixed-rate mortgages generally run from 
3⁄8 to 
1⁄2 a percentage point higher than conforming FRMs. When mortgage money is 
tight, the interest rate spread between conforming and jumbo FRMs is higher; 
when mortgage money is plentiful, the spread decreases.
 
If you find yourself slightly over Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s limit for 
either true conforming loans or the jumbo conforming loans, don’t despair. 
You can either buy a slightly less expensive home or increase your cash down 
payment juuuuuuuuuust enough to bring your mortgage amount under their 
loan limits. In Chapter 2, we thoughtfully include a lengthy list of financial 
resources you may be able to tap for additional cash.
Long-term or short-term mortgages
Any loan that’s amortized more than 30 years is considered to be a long-term 
mortgage. Reversing that guideline, short-term mortgages are loans that must 
be repaid in less than 30 years. Wow. Definitions that actually make sense. 
Will wonders never cease?
These standards hark back to less complicated times before the late 1970s 
when people could get any kind of mortgage they wanted as long as it was a 
30-year, fixed-rate loan. Back then, choices for a short-term mortgage were 
nearly as limited. Homebuyers could have an FRM with either a 10- or 15-year 
term or a balloon loan with, for example, a 30-year amortization schedule and 
a 10-year due date. They made the same monthly principal and interest 
payments for 10 years and then got hammered with a massive balloon 
payment to pay off the entire remaining loan balance.

75
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
The total interest charges on short-term mortgages are less than total 
interest paid for equally large long-term loans at the same interest rate. 
Short-term loans usually have lower interest rates than comparable long-
term mortgages. For instance, the interest rate on a conforming 15-year, 
fixed-rate mortgage is generally about 
1⁄2 a percentage point lower than a 
comparable 30-year FRM.
In our prior example (see the section “Grasping Loan Basics: Principal, 
Interest, Term, and Amortization”), we say that you’d spend $734 a month to 
repay a $100,000 FRM with an 8-percent interest rate and a 30-year term. The 
same FRM with a 15-year term and 8-percent interest rate costs $956 a month. 
If that loan has a 7.5-percent interest rate, its payment would drop to $928 
per month. The half-point interest rate cut saves you an additional $5,040 
over the life of the loan ($956 – $928 = $28 per month × 180 months). Not too 
shabby!
 
Even though short-term loans have lower interest rates than their long-term 
cousins, qualifying for a short-term loan is more difficult due to the higher 
monthly loan payments. Lenders generally don’t want you spending much 
more than 30 to 35 percent of your gross monthly income on mortgage 
payments. Even if you can qualify for a short-term loan, it may not be in your 
best interests (pun intended) to irrevocably lock yourself into the higher 
monthly payments. Will higher loan payments deplete the cash reserves you 
ought to maintain for emergencies? Can you afford higher loan payments and 
still accomplish all the other financial goals we cover in Chapter 1? We devote 
Chapter 15 to a stimulating analysis of the pros and cons of paying off a 
mortgage more rapidly than is required by the lender.
Introducing the Punitive Ps
Certain warnings are drilled into people until they become as reflexive as 
the way your leg convulsively jerks when a doctor hits your knee with that 
little pointy rubber hammer. Don’t stuff yourself on sweets just before 
sitting down to a good, healthy meal. Don’t forget to floss and brush your 
teeth. Don’t drink and drive. Other injurious hazards are more insidious. 
The following sections offer words to the wise about two of them related 
to mortgages.

Part II: Locating a Loan 
Prepayment penalties
Some lenders punish borrowers severely for repaying all or part of their 
conventional loan’s remaining principal balance before its due date. As 
punishment, they impose a charge known as a prepayment penalty. 
Prepayment penalties aren’t permitted on FHA, VA, and FmHA mortgages 
(see the earlier section, “Government or convention loans,” for more 
information on these kinds of mortgages).
How much money are we talking about? That depends. Maximum permissible 
prepayment penalties vary widely from state to state, from one lender to the 
next — and even from one loan to the next on mortgages offered by the same 
lending institution. Good lenders will waive the prepayment penalty if you get 
a new loan from them when you refinance your mortgage or if you’re forced 
to pay off the loan because you sell your house.
Less sympathetic souls force you to pay upward of 3 percent on your unpaid 
loan balance, which equals $3,000 on every $100,000 you prepay. Even less 
humane lenders may insist on a penalty equal to six month’s interest on your 
outstanding loan balance. If, for example, your mortgage’s interest rate is 8 
percent, you’d have to pay $4,000 per $100,000 of principal you repay early.
Now that we have your attention, here’s how to determine whether the 
lender can impose a prepayment penalty:
 
 Ask: Now that you know what to ask, don’t be shy. Look your loan 
officer right in the eye and specifically inquire whether the loan you’re 
considering has a prepayment penalty. If it does, we strongly urge you to 
keep looking until you find another equally wonderful mortgage without 
a prepayment penalty.
 
 Read: Even if the lender says that the loan doesn’t have a prepayment 
penalty, don’t take chances. Verify that the mortgage doesn’t have a 
prepayment penalty clause by carefully reading the federal truth-in-
lending disclosure you’ll receive from the lender soon after submitting 
your loan application. Even good lenders frequently don’t know the 
nuances of every single loan they offer.
 
 Read again: Check, double check, and check again, we say repeatedly. You 
must scrutinize one last document to be sure that your loan doesn’t have a 
prepayment penalty — the promissory note. Read it with care. Make sure 
that a prepayment penalty clause doesn’t somehow manage to mysteriously 
creep into your mortgage before you sign the final loan documents.
 
Some mortgages have soft prepayment penalties, which may be waived at the 
lender’s discretion if you sell an owner-occupied one- to four-unit property 
after you’ve owned the property at least one year. Soft prepayment penal-
ties are infinitely preferable to hard prepayment penalties, which are always 
enforced without exception.

77
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
You may be tempted to get a loan with a prepayment penalty, because you’re 
absolutely certain that there’s no way you’ll ever pay it off early. Trust us 
when we say that circumstances have a way of changing when you least 
expect them to. Utterly unforeseen life changes force folks to sell property 
whether they want to or not. Divorce happens. People get fired. Folks pass 
away prematurely. Life happens.
 
You may decide, in your infinite wisdom, to get a mortgage that has a 
prepayment penalty. Fine. If your mom couldn’t make you eat your 
vegetables, how can we make you follow our sage advice? At least make 
sure that you completely understand the terms and conditions of your 
mortgage contract’s prepayment penalty clause regarding:
 
 The amount you can prepay without penalty: For instance, some 
lenders permit you to prepay up to 20 percent of your original loan 
amount or current loan balance without penalty each calendar year. 
Others impose a penalty from dollar one of any prepayment. The more 
you can prepay without penalty, the better.
 
 When you can prepay without penalty: You may be allowed to prepay 
a specific amount of money or percentage of your original loan balance 
quarterly without penalty. Other lenders let you prepay funds without 
penalty only once a year. The faster you can prepay without penalty, the 
better.
 
 The duration of prepayment penalty: Mortgages on owner-occupied 
residential property often specify that the prepayment penalty expires 
three to five years after loan origination. Other home mortgages have 
prepayment penalties over the full term of the loan. The faster the 
prepayment penalty vanishes, the better.
 
 The severity of prepayment penalty: Some prepayment penalties 
diminish in severity as the mortgage matures. You could, for example, 
be penalized 5 percent on any funds prepaid within one year of loan 
origination, 4 percent in the second year, 3 percent for the third year 
and so on. Other mortgages impose the same vicious penalty as long 
as the prepayment clause is in effect. Declining penalties are better.
Private mortgage insurance (PMI)
Mortgage insurance protects lenders from losses they may incur due to the 
dreaded double whammy of default and foreclosure. You’re probably won-
dering why mortgage insurance is referred to as PMI. That’s easy. Remember 
that Uncle Sam either insures or guarantees FHA, VA, and FmHA government 
loans. The other 80 percent of U.S. residential mortgages are conventional loans. 
These loans are protected by private (nongovernment) companies that issue 
private mortgage insurance — PMI for short.

78
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Who pays for this insurance? You, of course — if you want a conventional 
loan and can’t make at least a 20-percent cash down payment on the property 
you’re buying or refinancing. (If that doesn’t apply to you, school’s out. You 
have our permission to skip the rest of this chapter.)
“Wait a second,” you say. “That seems incredibly inequitable, even for lenders. I 
pay for the insurance, but my lender gets the proceeds? What’s in it for me?” 
A loan. It’s the only way to get conventional financing with a low cash down 
payment. That’s the deal. Take it or leave.
Twenty percent is a magic number to institutional lenders. They made a 
fascinating empirical discovery after suffering through years of expensive, 
unpleasant experiences with belly-flopped loans. At least a 20-percent down 
payment is necessary to protect their investment (the mortgage) if you cut 
and run on your loan. We know you’re wonderful and would never default 
on your mortgage. Unfortunately, lenders don’t know you nearly as well as 
we do.
Look at things from their perspective. Suppose you put only 10 percent cash 
down. A severe recession occurs, and property values drop 15 percent. You 
lose your job because your business fails, and you can’t make your monthly 
loan payments. The lender is forced to take your house away from you in a 
foreclosure action and sell it to satisfy your debt. Farfetched? Hardly. Read 
your local paper. Stranger things happen every day. Witness the jump in 
foreclosures in most areas in the late 2000s.
After the poor, misunderstood lender pays the real estate commission, 
property transfer tax, and other customary expenses associated with the sale 
of your house, there won’t be nearly enough money left to pay off your loan. 
Your lender will lose his corporate shirt. If that scenario happens too often, 
the lender goes belly up.
 
You may be able to deduct your PMI premiums on your federal tax return. For 
loans that commenced after 2006, borrowers with an adjusted gross income 
(AGI) of up to $100,000 may deduct their PMI premiums as they do mortgage 
interest on IRS Form 1040, Schedule A. The deduction, which is set to expire 
in 2010, is phased out in 10 percent increments for each $1,000 in increased 
income above $100,000. Above $109,000, PMI isn’t tax deductible.
What you’ll end up spending for PMI depends upon the following factors:
 
 Type of loan: For example, ARMs generally have higher PMI premiums 
than FRMs. (The previous sentence would have been utterly unintelligible 
gibberish before you read this chapter. See how well you’ve mastered 
the lingo? We’re so proud of you.) If you don’t understand this sentence, 
check out the section “Eyeing Classic Mortgage Jargon Duets” earlier in 
this chapter.

79
 Chapter 4: Fathoming the Fundamentals
 
 Loan amount: Your PMI premium is partially based on a percentage of 
the loan amount — the more you borrow, the more you’ll pay for PMI.
 
 Loan-to-value ratio (LTV): LTV is the loan amount divided by the 
appraised value of the property you’re buying or refinancing. The higher 
the LTV, the greater the risk of default to the lender and, hence, the 
higher your PMI premium.
 
 The insurance company issuing your PMI: This is the least important 
factor because PMI charges usually vary relatively little from one insurance 
provider to the next. It can’t hurt, however, to instruct your lender to shop 
around for the best deal.
 
Even though PMI charges don’t usually vary much from one insurer to 
the next, the type of loan they insure and geographical areas of coverage 
can vary wildly. The late 2000s mortgage market problems made lenders 
more cautious. Ditto PMI insurers. MGIC (Mortgage Guaranty Insurance 
Corporation, the largest private mortgage insurer), PMI Group, and Genworth 
Financial (two other large insurers) are now much more selective about loans 
they’ll insure. Insurers are skittish now about property in distressed markets 
where values are declining, ARMs with negative amortization potential, 
limited documentation mortgages, and loans with less than 5 percent cash 
down. Your lender may have to shop around to find a PMI provider who’ll 
issue your policy.
PMI origination fees and monthly premiums change frequently. Check with 
your lender for specifics on PMI expenses for your loan.
 
PMI isn’t a permanent condition. You can discontinue it by proving you have 
at least 20-percent equity in your property. Equity is the difference between 
your home’s market value and what you owe on it. The magic 20 percent can 
come from a variety of sources: an increase in property values; paying down 
your loan; improving the property by, for example, modernizing the kitchen 
or adding a second bathroom; or any combination of these factors. To remove 
PMI, your lender will no doubt insist that you have the property appraised (at 
your expense, of course) to establish its current market value. Spending two 
or three hundred dollars for an appraisal that’ll save you hundreds or more a 
year in PMI expenses is a wise investment. (We also thoughtfully include a 
section in Chapter 6 about how you may be able to use 80-10-10 financing to 
avoid paying PMI.)

A
s you consider your mortgage options, you may quickly find yourself 
overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices. Should you choose a 
15-year fixed-rate loan or a 30-year fixed-rate loan? What about mortgages 
that have variable interest rates — some adjust monthly, others every 6 or 12 
months. Still others have a fixed interest rate for say the first one, three, five, 
seven, or ten years and then convert into some sort of adjustable rate. Or 
you can choose loans that start out as adjustable interest rate mortgages but 
allow you to elect at some future date to convert into a fixed-rate loan!
Most mortgages come with a number of bells and whistles, which means that 
literally tens of thousands of loan choices are available. Talk about a mortgage 
migraine! This chapter goes over the many options you can choose from and 
helps you home in on which ones work best for you.
Three Questions to Help You 
Pick the Right Mortgage
Here’s a clutter-busting pain reliever. Each and every possible mortgage 
you may consider falls into one of two major camps: fixed-rate mortgage or 
adjustable-rate mortgage (if these terms are foreign to you, be sure to read 
Chapter 4). Later in this chapter, we delve into the details of fixed- versus 
adjustable-rate mortgages.

82
Part II: Locating a Loan 
First, however, we want to help you separate the forest from the trees. 
Following are three questions you need to ask yourself as you weigh which 
type of mortgage is best for you.
How long do you plan to 
keep your mortgage?
From a financial perspective, this is the most important question. Many 
homebuyers don’t expect to stay in their current homes for a long time. If 
that’s your expectation, consider an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Why? 
Because an ARM starts at a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate loan, so you 
should save interest dollars in the first few years of holding your ARM.
A mortgage lender takes more risk when lending money at a fixed rate of 
interest for a longer period of time. Thus, compared with an ARM, where the 
lender is committing to the initial interest rate for a relatively short period of 
time, lenders charge a premium interest-rate for a fixed-rate loan.
 
The interest rates used to determine most ARMs are short-term interest rates, 
whereas long-term interest rates dictate the terms of fixed-rate mortgages. During 
most time periods, longer-term interest rates are higher than shorter-term rates, 
because of the greater risk the lender accepts in committing to a longer-term rate.
The downside to an ARM, however, is that if interest rates rise, you may find 
yourself paying more interest in future years than you would be paying had 
you taken out a fixed-rate loan from the get-go. If you’re reasonably certain 
that you’ll hold onto your home for five years or less, however, you may 
come out ahead with an adjustable.
If you expect to hold onto your home and mortgage for more than five to 
seven years, a fixed-rate loan may make more sense, especially if you’re not 
in a financial position to withstand the fluctuating monthly payments that 
come with an ARM. If you’re expecting to stay five to ten years, consider the 
hybrid loans we discuss in the “Hybrid loans” section later in this chapter.
How much financial risk can you accept?
Many homebuyers, particularly first-timers, take an adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) because doing so allows them to stretch and buy a more expensive 
home. We Americans aren’t known for our delayed gratification discipline! Also, 
real estate and mortgage salespeople, who derive commissions either from the 
cost of the home that you buy or the size of the mortgage that you take on, may 
encourage you to stretch. So, if you haven’t already done so, please be sure to 
read Chapter 1 in order to understand how much you can really afford to borrow 
given your other financial needs, commitments, and goals.

83
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
If you’re considering an ARM, you absolutely, positively must understand what 
rising interest rates — and, therefore, a rising monthly mortgage payment — can 
do to your personal finances. Consider taking an ARM only if you can answer yes 
to all the following questions:
 
 Is your monthly budget such that you can afford higher mortgage pay-
ments and still accomplish other important personal financial goals, 
such as saving for retirement, your children’s future educational costs, 
vacations, and the like?
 
 Do you have an emergency reserve, equal to at least three to six months 
of living expenses, which you can tap into to make the potentially higher 
monthly mortgage payments?
 
 Can you afford the highest payment allowed on the adjustable-rate 
mortgage? The mortgage lender can tell you the highest possible 
monthly payment, which is the payment that you’d owe if the interest 
rate on your ARM went to the lifetime interest-rate cap allowed on the 
loan.
 
 Never take an ARM without understanding and being comfortable with 
your ability to handle the highest payment allowed. Prior to the real estate 
market downturn in the late 2000s, many lenders qualified borrowers for 
an ARM if they could pay the artificially low initial loan payments. Now 
lenders are far more likely to qualify you for an ARM based upon your 
ability to afford the maximum loan payment you may have to make.
 
 If you’re stretching to borrow near the maximum the lender allows or an 
amount that will test the limits of your budget, are your job and income 
stable? If you’re a two-income household, can you keep making loan 
payments if one of you loses your job? If you expect to have children in 
the future, remember that your household expenses will rise and your 
disposable income may fall with the arrival of those little bundles of joy.
 
 Can you handle the psychological stresses of dealing with changing 
interest rates and mortgage payments?
If you’re fiscally positioned to take on the financial risks inherent to an ARM, 
by all means consider one. As we discuss in the previous section, odds are 
you can save money in interest charges with an ARM. Relative to a fixed-rate 
loan, your interest rate should start lower and should stay lower if the overall 
level of interest rates doesn’t change.
Even if interest rates do rise, as they inevitably and eventually will, they inevitably 
and eventually will come back down. So, if you can stick with your ARM through 
times of high and low interest rates, you should still come out ahead.
Although ARMs do carry the risk of a fluctuating interest rate, as we discuss 
in the “Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)” section later in this chapter, 
almost all adjustable-rate loans limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate 
allowed on your loan. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over 
the life of the loan.

84
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
Consider an adjustable-rate mortgage only if you’re financially and emotionally 
secure enough to handle the maximum possible payments over an extended 
period of time. ARMs work best for borrowers who take out smaller loans than 
they’re qualified for or who consistently save more than 10 percent of their 
monthly incomes. If you do choose an ARM, make sure you have a significant 
cash cushion that’s accessible in the event that rates go up.
How much money do you need?
One factor that distinguishes the best mortgage from inferior loans is that 
the best mortgage is the best deal you can get. Why waste your hard-earned 
money on a mediocre mortgage? That’s not why you bought this book. The 
amount of money you borrow can greatly affect your loan’s interest rate. 
That’s why it behooves you to carefully consider how much money you need.
As we painstakingly point out in Chapter 4, conventional mortgages that 
stay within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits established each year by 
Congress are called conforming loans. Mortgages that exceed the maximum 
permissible loan amounts are referred to either as jumbo conforming loans, 
nonconforming loans, or jumbo loans.
For example, the conforming loan limit for single-family dwellings in the con-
tinental U.S. was $417,000 when this book went to press. Because mortgage 
maximums change annually, however, be sure to check with your lender for 
the current Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits. If the mortgage you need 
far exceeds the present conforming loan limit, skip the rest of this section. If, 
however, your loan is within 10 percent or so of the loan limit, keep reading. 
Our forthcoming advice may save you major money.
 
Why are we making such a fuss about the loan limit? Because mortgage 
interest rates for conforming loans run anywhere from 
1⁄2- to 1
1⁄2-percent lower 
than the interest rates for jumbo loans. Keeping the amount of money you 
borrow under that all-important loan limit saves you big bucks over the life of 
your loan.
 
If your mortgage slightly surpasses Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s loan limit, 
we know three ways to bring it into conformity:
 
 Spend less on a home. This may seem obvious, but what the heck, 
we’ve never been accused of subtlety! The less you pay for a home, the 
smaller your mortgage.
 
 Increase your down payment to reduce the mortgage. We include a 
long list of cash cows you may be able to milk in Chapter 2.
 
 Use 80-10-10 financing. Chapter 6 has an extremely enlightening section 
about 80-10-10 financing techniques you may be able to use to cut your 
first mortgage down to size.

85
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
Now, get down to the brass tacks of understanding the major features of 
fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate mortgages. Keeping the previous three 
questions in mind (How long do you plan to keep your mortgage? How 
much risk can you handle? How much money do you need?), read the 
following sections and ponder which mortgage works best for you.
Fixed-Rate Mortgages: No Surprises
As you may have surmised from the name, fixed-rate mortgages have interest 
rates that are fixed (that is, the rate doesn’t change) for the entire life of the 
loan, which is typically 15 or 30 years. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest 
rate stays the same, and the amount of your monthly mortgage payment doesn’t 
change. Thus, you have no surprises, no uncertainty, and no anxiety over 
possible changes in your monthly payment as you have with an adjustable-rate 
mortgage.
Figure 5-1 illustrates how 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage interest rates have 
fluctuated over the years. You can bet with 100-percent certainty that they’ll 
continue to bounce up and down due to ever changing economic conditions. 
However, we promise that once you have your very own 30-year fixed-rate 
loan, its interest rate won’t ever change.

86
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Because the interest rate doesn’t vary with a fixed-rate mortgage, the advantage 
of a fixed-rate mortgage is that you always know what your monthly payment is 
going to be. Thus, budgeting and planning the rest of your personal finances is 
easier.
That’s the good news. The bad news, as we allude to earlier in this chapter, is 
that with a fixed-rate mortgage, you pay a premium, in the form of a higher 
interest rate, to get a lender to commit to lending you money over the full 
term of the mortgage. The longer the term for which a mortgage lender 
agrees to accept a fixed interest rate, the more risk that lender is taking.
In addition to paying a premium interest rate when you originally get a fixed-
rate loan, another potential drawback to fixed-rate loans is that, if interest 
rates fall significantly after you have your mortgage, you face the risk of being 
stranded with your costly mortgage. That could happen if, for example, due 
to problems with your personal financial situation or a decline in the value 
of your property, you don’t qualify to refinance, a topic we cover in Chapter 
11. Even if you do qualify to refinance, doing so takes time and costs money 
(appraisal, loan fees, and title insurance).
Here are a couple of other possible drawbacks to be aware of with some 
fixed-rate mortgages:
 
 Fixed-rate mortgages aren’t assumable, so if you sell during a period of 
high interest rates, your buyers must obtain their own financing. Finding 
assumable ARMs, however, is becoming more and more difficult.
 
 As with some adjustable-rate mortgages, some fixed-rate mortgages 
have prepayment penalties (see Chapter 4 for an explanation).
Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have an interest rate that varies over time. On 
a typical ARM, the interest rate adjusts every 6 or 12 months, but it may change 
as frequently as monthly. As we discuss later in this chapter, the interest rate on 
an ARM is primarily determined by what’s happening to interest rates in general. 
If most interest rates are on the rise, odds are that your ARM will also experience 
increasing rates, thus increasing the size of your mortgage payment. Conversely, 
when interest rates fall, ARM interest rates and payments follow suit eventually.
If the interest rate on your mortgage fluctuates, so will your monthly 
payment sooner or later. And therein lies the risk: Because a mortgage 
payment is probably one of your biggest monthly expenses (if not the 
biggest), an adjustable-rate mortgage that’s adjusting upwards can wreak 
havoc with your budget.

87
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
You may be attracted to an ARM because it starts out at a lower interest 
rate than a fixed-rate loan and thus enables you to qualify to borrow more. 
However, just because you can qualify to borrow more doesn’t mean that you 
can afford to borrow that much, given your other financial goals and needs. 
See Chapter 1 for all the details.
The right reason to consider an ARM is because you may save money on interest 
charges and you can afford the risk of higher payments if interest rates rise. 
Because you accept the risk of an increase in interest rates, mortgage lenders cut 
you a little slack. The initial interest rate (also known as the teaser rate) should 
be significantly less than the initial interest rate on a comparable fixed-rate loan. 
In fact, even with subsequent rate adjustments, an ARM’s interest rate for the 
first year or two of the loan is generally lower than a fixed-rate mortgage.
Another important advantage of an ARM is that, if you purchase your home 
during a time of high interest rates, you can start paying your mortgage with 
the artificially depressed initial interest rate. If overall interest rates then 
decline, you can capture the benefits of lower rates without refinancing.
Here’s another situation when adjustable-rate loans have an advantage over 
their fixed-rate brethren: If, for whatever reason, you don’t qualify to refinance 
your mortgage when interest rates decline, you can still reap the advantage of 
lower rates. The good news for homeowners who can’t refinance and who have 
an ARM is that they’ll receive many of the benefits of the lower rates as their 
ARM’s interest rate and payments adjust downward with declining rates. With 
a fixed-rate loan, by contrast, you must refinance in order to realize the 
benefits of a decline in interest rates.
The downside to an adjustable-rate loan is that, if interest rates in general 
rise, your loan’s interest and monthly payment will likely rise, too. During 
most time periods, if rates rise more than 1 to 2 percent and stay elevated, 
the adjustable-rate loan is likely to cost you more than a fixed-rate loan.
Before you make any decision between a fixed-rate mortgage versus an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, please read the following sections for a crash 
course in understanding ARMs.
How an ARM’s interest rate is determined
Most ARMs start at an artificially low interest rate. Don’t select an ARM 
based on this rate because you’ll probably be paying this low rate for no 
more than 6 to 12 months, and perhaps for as little as 1 month. Like other 
salespeople, lenders promote the most attractive features of their product 
and ignore the negatives. The low starting rate on an ARM is what some 
lenders are most likely to tell you about because profit-hungry mortgage 
lenders know that inexperienced, financially constrained borrowers focus 
on this low advertised initial rate.

88
Part II: Locating a Loan 
The starting rate on an ARM isn’t anywhere near as important as what the 
future interest rate is going to be on the loan. How the future interest rate 
on an ARM is determined is the most important issue for you to understand 
when evaluating an ARM — if you plan on holding onto your loan for more 
than a few months.
To establish what the interest rate on an ARM will be in the future, you need 
to know the loan’s index and margin, the two of which are added together. So 
ignore, for now, an ARM’s starting rate and begin your evaluation of an ARM 
by understanding what index it is tied to and what margin it has.
What are the index and margin? We’re glad you asked!
Start with the index
The index on an ARM is a measure of general interest rate trends that the 
lender uses to determine changes in the mortgage’s interest rate. For example, 
the six-month bank certificate of deposit index is used as a reference for some 
mortgages (a certificate of deposit, or CD, is the savings vehicle available at 
your friendly neighborhood bank).
Suppose that the going rate on six-month CDs is approximately 2 percent. 
The index theoretically indicates how much it costs the bank to take in 
money, for example, from people investing in the bank’s CDs, which the bank 
can then lend to you, the mortgage borrower.
The following sections explain the most common ARM indexes. Don’t 
worry about lenders playing games with the indexes to unfairly raise your 
ARM’s interest rate. Lenders don’t control any of the indexes we discuss. 
Furthermore, they’re easy to verify. If you want to check the figures, you can 
usually find these indexes in publications such as The Wall Street Journal or 
the business section of your local newspaper. Also, see our recommended 
Web sites in Chapter 8 for online sources for this information.
Treasury bills (T-bills)
The U.S. federal government is the largest borrower in the world. So it should 
come as no surprise that some ARM indexes are based on the interest rate that 
the government pays on some of its pile of debt. The most commonly used 
government interest rate indexes for ARMs are for 6-month and 12-month 
treasury bills.
The treasury bill indexes are volatile; they tend to be among the faster-moving 
ones around. In other words, they respond quickly to market changes in 
interest rates. Treasury bill indexes are good when interest rates are falling 
and lousy when rates head north.

 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
Certificates of deposit (CDs)
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are interest-bearing bank investments that lock 
you in for a specific period of time. Adjustable-rate mortgages are sometimes 
tied to the average interest rate banks are paying on six-month CDs.
As with treasury bills, CDs tend to move rapidly with overall changes in 
interest rates. However, CD rates tend to move up a bit more slowly when 
rates rise, because profit-minded bankers take their sweet time when it 
comes to paying more interest to depositors. Conversely, CD rates tend to 
come down quickly when rates decline so that bankers can maintain their 
profits.
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI)
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (also known as COFI, pronounced like 
the ambrosial brew some get addicted to) tracks the weighted average cost 
of savings, borrowings, and advances for Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
member banks located in California, Arizona, and Nevada (the 11th District). 
Because the COFI is a moving average of interest rates that bankers have paid 
depositors over recent months, it tends to be a relatively stable index. The 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board publishes this index monthly.
An ARM tied to a slower-moving index, such as the COFI, has the advantage 
of increasing more slowly when interest rates are on the upswing. On the 
other hand, you have to be patient to benefit from falling interest rates when 
rates are on the decline. The 11th District is slow to fall when interest rates 
decline.
Because ARMs tied to the COFI are slower to rise when overall interest rates 
rise, they generally begin at a higher rate of interest than do ARMs tied to 
faster moving indexes.
 
If the start rate for an ARM is far lower than others in the market place, that’s 
usually a red flag. The loan probably has negative amortization. See the later 
section, “Does the loan have negative amortization?” for details. 
 
Especially for risk-averse mortgage borrowers, COFI offers you more protection 
than any other ARM index if interest rates sharply increase. Conversely, if inter-
est rates plummet and your COFI-indexed ARM’s interest rate doesn’t follow suit, 
you have the option to solve that pleasant problem by refinancing your loan.
The London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR)
The London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR) is an average of the interest 
rates that major international banks charge each other to borrow U.S. dollars 
in the London money market. Like the U.S. treasury and CD indexes, LIBOR 
tends to move and adjust quite rapidly to changes in interest rates.

90
Part II: Locating a Loan 
This international interest-rate index has become increasing popular as more 
and more foreign investors buy American mortgages as investments. Not 
surprisingly, these investors like ARMs tied to an index that they understand 
and are familiar with. For those of you who crave stability, beware that LIBOR 
is more volatile than COFI.
 
Be sure to ask your lender how the index tied to the ARM you’re considering 
has changed in the last five or ten years. Figure 5-2 helps you compare the 
volatility of the most common indexes.

Add the margin
The margin, or spread as it’s also known, on an ARM is the lenders’ profit, 
or markup, on the money that they lend. Most ARM loans have margins of 
around 2.5 percent, but the exact margin depends on the lender and the 
index that lender is using. When you compare several loans that are tied to 
the same index and are otherwise the same, the loan with the lowest margin 
is better (cheaper) for you.
All good things end sooner or later. After the initial interest rate period 
expires, an ARM’s future interest rate is determined, subject to the loan’s 
interest rate cap limitations as explained later in this section, by adding 
together the loan’s current index value and the margin.

91
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
This following formula applies every time the ARM’s interest rate is adjusted:
Index + margin = interest rate
For example, suppose your loan is tied to the one-year treasury bill index, 
which is currently at 2.5 percent, plus a margin of 2.25 percent. Thus, your 
loan’s interest rate is:
2.5 percent + 2.25 = 4.75 percent
This figure is known as the fully indexed rate. If a loan is advertised with an 
initial interest rate of say 3.5 percent, the fully indexed rate (in this case, 4.75 
percent) tells you what interest rate this ARM would rise to if the market 
level of interest rates, as measured by the one-year treasury bill index, stays 
at the same level.
Always be sure to understand the fully indexed rate on an ARM you’re 
considering.
How often does the interest rate adjust?
Although some ARMs have an interest rate adjustment monthly, most adjust 
every 6 or 12 months, using the mortgage-rate determination formula discussed 
previously. In advance of each adjustment, the mortgage lender should mail you 
a notice, explaining how the new rate is calculated according to the agreed-upon 
terms of your ARM.
The less frequently your loan adjusts, the less financial risk you’re accepting. 
In exchange for taking less risk, the mortgage lender normally expects you 
to pay more — such as a higher initial interest rate and/or higher ongoing 
margin.
What are the limits on rate adjustments?
As discussed earlier in this chapter, despite the fact that an ARM has a 
formula for determining future interest rates (index + margin = interest 
rate), a good ARM limits the magnitude of change that can occur in the 
actual rate that you pay. These limits, also known as rate caps, affect each 
future adjustment of an ARM’s rate following the expiration of the initial 
rate period.

92
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Two types of rate caps exist:
 
 Periodic adjustment caps: These caps limit the maximum rate change, 
up or down, allowed at each adjustment. For ARMs that adjust at six-
month intervals, the adjustment cap is generally plus or minus 1 
percent. ARMs that adjust more than once annually generally restrict 
the maximum rate change allowed over the entire year, as well. This 
annual rate cap is typically plus or minus 2 percent.
 
 Lifetime caps: Never, ever, ever take an ARM without a lifetime cap. This 
cap limits the highest rate allowed over the entire life of the loan. ARMs 
commonly have lifetime caps of 5 to 6 percent higher than the initial 
start rate.
 
 Without a lifetime cap, your possible loan payment could grow to the 
moon if interest rates soar again as they did in the early 1980s when 
rates peaked at more than 18 percent. Be sure you can handle the 
maximum possible payment allowed on an ARM if the interest rate rises 
to the lifetime cap.
 
You may be wondering why we stress that interest rate adjustments are 
capped both up and down. Who cares how much rates can go down? You 
will, if rates drop rapidly and your ARM responds like molasses on a sub-zero 
winter morning. As we discuss in Chapter 11, a good reason to refinance an 
ARM is to lower the periodic and lifetime adjustment caps accordingly if 
interest rates decline significantly.
Does the loan have negative amortization?
On a normal mortgage, as you make mortgage payments over time, the loan 
balance you owe is gradually reduced through a process called amortization 
(see Chapter 4). Some ARMs, however, cap the increase of your monthly 
payment but don’t limit how much the interest rate can increase. The size of 
your mortgage payment may not reflect all the interest that you actually owe. 
So, rather than paying the interest that’s owed and paying off some of your 
loan balance every month, you may end up paying some (but not all) of the 
interest that you owe.
Thus, the extra, unpaid interest that you still owe is added to your outstanding 
debt. This process of increasing the size of your loan balance is called 
negative amortization. Negative amortization is like paying only the minimum 
payment required on a credit card bill. You continue accumulating additional 
interest on the balance as long as you make only the minimum monthly 
payment. However, doing this with a mortgage defeats the purpose of your 
borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals (as we discuss in 
Chapter 1).

93
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
Some lenders try to hide the fact that an ARM they’re pitching you has 
negative amortization. How can you avoid negative amortization loans?
 
 Ask. As you discuss specific loan programs with lenders or mortgage bro-
kers, be sure to tell them you don’t want a loan with negative amortization. 
Specifically ask them if the ARM they’re suggesting has it or not.
 
 You must be especially wary of being pitched negative amortization 
loans if you’re having trouble finding lenders willing to offer you a 
mortgage (in other words, you’re considered a credit risk).
 
 If the loan has a monthly adjustment, ask again. Monthly adjusting 
ARMs are often a warning sign of a negative amortization loan. Another 
red flag is an ARM with annual payment caps rather than semi-annual or 
annual interest rate adjustment caps.
How bad is negative amortization?
Negative amortization loans are also called 
option ARMs because they offer three different 
options for making mortgage payments. Each 
month you have the choice of doing one of the 
following:
  Making a fully amortized payment that 
includes principal and interest
  Making a smaller payment by paying only 
the loan’s interest charge with no principal
  Lowering your payment even further by 
making a capped loan payment that doesn’t 
cover all the loan’s interest charge and 
results in negative amortization (an addition 
to your balance owed)
A disproportionately high percentage of nega-
tive amortization ARMs went into foreclosure 
during the late 2000s real estate market down-
turn. Some lenders explained this dismal fact 
by pointing out it’s because a disproportion-
ately high percentage of folks who got this type 
of loan weren’t creditworthy borrowers. That 
may account for part of the problem. However, 
it’s disingenuous for lenders to express shock 
when people they’ve led into temptation 
succumb to the temptation of making the lowest 
possible monthly payment even if it results in 
negative amortization.
Good news. It’s getting much harder to find 
negative amortization ARMs. Most lenders no 
longer offer them. If you need private mortgage 
insurance (PMI, which we cover in Chapter 
4) because you can’t make a 20-percent cash 
down payment, be advised that PMI companies 
won’t insure negative amortization ARMs. If you 
currently have a negative amortization loan on 
your property, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll find 
a lender willing to give you a home equity loan 
(see Chapter 6 for more gory details).

94
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Hybrid loans
If you expect to keep your loan for no more than five to ten years, and if you 
want more stability in your monthly payments than comes with a regular ARM, 
a hybrid loan may be your best option. All hybrid loans start out as fixed-rate 
loans — the initial rate on the mortgage is actually fixed for three, five, seven, 
or even ten years — and then the loan converts into an ARM, usually adjusting 
every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Somewhat similar loans are also available, 
known as 7/23s. These loans are fixed for the first seven years, have a one-time 
adjustment, and remain at a fixed rate for the remaining 23 years.
The longer the initial rate stays locked in, the higher the rate will be, but the 
initial rate of a hybrid ARM is almost always lower than the interest rate on a 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. However, because the initial rate of hybrid loans 
is locked in for a longer period of time than the six-month or one-year term 
of regular ARMs, hybrid ARMs have higher initial interest rates than regular 
ARM loans.
 
To evaluate hybrids, weigh the likelihood that you’ll move before the initial 
loan interest rate expires. For example, with a five-year hybrid, if you’re 
saving, say, 0.75 percent per year versus the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, 
but you’re quite sure that you’ll move within five years, the hybrid will 
probably save you money. On the other hand, if you have a reasonable 
chance of staying put for more than five years, and you don’t want to face 
the risk of rising payments after five years, you should consider a 30-year, 
fixed-rate mortgage instead.
You may occasionally find little difference between short-term and long-term 
interest rates. For example, we’ve seen periods when the interest-rate spread 
between an ARM’s initial interest rate and a fixed-rate loan’s interest rate was 
less than 1 percent. We’ve also seen times when the initial interest rate on 
a seven- or ten-year hybrid was exactly the same as on a 30-year, fixed-rate 
loan. In this type of situation, fixed-rate loans offer the best overall value.
Fine-Tuning Your Thought Process
Now that you know darn near everything worth knowing about fixed-rate 
mortgages, ARMs, and hybrid loans, you’re probably in a veritable frenzy of 
excitement about getting yourself preapproved for a loan. Not so fast, grass-
hopper. We have a few more words of wisdom for you.

95
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
Finding funds
Before you rush off, wouldn’t it be wise to find out where the money is? Here 
are the big sources for home purchase mortgages:
 
 Conventional loans: As noted in Chapter 4, about 80 percent of U.S. 
residential mortgages are conventional loans originated by lending 
institutions such as banks, savings and loan associations, and credit 
unions. Chapter 7 covers the merits of shopping for a loan yourself 
versus using a mortgage broker to assist you.
 
 Government loans: This category covers approximately 20 percent 
of U.S. home mortgages. Low-income borrowers or folks with little or 
no cash for a down payment may be able to qualify for a variety of 
home loans either insured or guaranteed by an agency of the federal 
government. See Chapter 4 for additional information about Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 
and Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loans.
 
 Seller loans: These mortgages, which are generally referred to as 
owner-carry financing, represent less than 5 percent of the loan market. 
They are, however, an extremely important loan source during periods 
of high mortgage interest rates. Owner-carry financing is usually struc-
tured as home purchase first mortgages, which we cover in Chapter 7, 
or second mortgages (we’ve thought of everything — see Chapter 6).
 
Almost all conventional first mortgages and government loans are fully amor-
tized. That means they’re designed to be repaid in full by the time you make 
the last regularly scheduled monthly payment. Darn near all owner-carry first 
mortgages, conversely, come due with a generally quite large unpaid balance. 
This type of financing is called a balloon loan. As noted in Chapter 6, balloon 
loans can be extremely hazardous to your fiscal health if you can’t repay or 
refinance them when they’re due and payable — borrower beware!
Making the 30-year versus 15-year 
mortgage decision
After you decide which type of mortgage — fixed, adjustable, or hybrid — you 
desire, you have one more major choice to make. Do you prefer a 15-year or a 
30-year loan term? (You may run across some odd-length mortgages — such 
as 20- and 40-year mortgages; however, the issues we discuss in this section 
remain the same as when comparing 15-year to 30-year mortgages.)
If you’re stretching to buy the home of your dreams, you may not have a 
choice. The only loan you may qualify for is a 30-year mortgage. That isn’t 
necessarily bad and, in fact, has advantages.

96
Part II: Locating a Loan 
The main advantage that a 30-year mortgage has over a comparable 15-year 
loan is that it has lower monthly payments that free up more of your monthly 
income for other purposes, such as saving for other important financial 
goals like retirement. You may want to have more money each month so that 
you aren’t a financial prisoner in your abode. A 30-year mortgage has lower 
monthly payments because you have a longer time period to repay it (which 
translates into more payments). A fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage with an interest 
rate of 7 percent, for example, has payments that are approximately 25 percent 
lower than those on a comparable 15-year mortgage.
What if you can afford the higher payments that a 15-year mortgage requires? 
Should you take it? Not necessarily. What if, instead of making large payments 
on the 15-year mortgage, you make smaller payments on a 30-year mortgage 
and put that extra money to productive use?
Understanding interest-only loans
As we discuss in Chapter 4, mortgages are 
usually amortized (repaid) with monthly pay-
ments consisting of interest plus principal used 
to pay off the loan. Interest-only loan payments 
are just that — all interest, no principal — at 
least in their early years.
For example, suppose you get an interest-only 
(for the first five years), $250,000 fixed-rate 
mortgage at 6-percent interest. Your initial loan 
payment on this loan is $1,250 per month versus 
$1,500 a month on the same $250,000, traditional 
fixed-rate loan amortized over 30 years. The 
extra $250 is principal. During the next 30 years, 
the principal portion of each monthly $1,500 
payment would get slightly larger and the interest 
portion slightly smaller until the loan was paid 
off.
Most interest-only mortgages will after an 
initial time period such as three, five, seven, 
or ten years begin to amortize to repay your 
principal over the remaining loan term. 
Continuing with the example we’re using, after 
the first five years, the mortgage payment jumps 
from $1,250 to $1,610 to get the loan balance 
paid off over the remaining 25 years. Beware 
that some interest-only mortgages are actually 
balloon loans (discussed in Chapter 6).
During the real estate boom in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, especially in high-cost housing 
areas, interest-only mortgages were being 
marketed to borrowers for their:
  Minimum monthly loan payments
  Tax benefits, because 100 percent of 
the payment is generally tax-deductible 
mortgage interest
If you intend to keep your first home only a few 
years before moving up to your dream home, 
paying off the loan may be less important to you 
than keeping your monthly payments as low 
as possible. But, as we’ve long advised, tread 
carefully if you’re considering an interest-only 
mortgage. Be sure that you understand all the 
conditions, especially when and by how much 
the payment increases when the mortgage 
begins amortizing. Our biggest concern with 
interest-only mortgages is that some people 
may continually use them to stretch their hous-
ing budgets. Review Chapter 1 to find out how 
to assess your financial condition and budget.

97
 Chapter 5: Selecting the Best Home Purchase Loan
If you do make productive use of that extra money, then the 30-year mort-
gage may be for you. A terrific potential use for that extra dough is to 
contribute it to a tax-deductible retirement account. Contributions that 
you add to employer-based 401(k) and 403(b) plans (and self-employed 
SEP-IRAs or Keoghs) not only give you an immediate reduction in taxes 
but also enable your money to compound, tax-deferred, over the years 
ahead. Another vehicle for tax deductible contributions is the newer Health 
Savings Account (HSA) for those with higher deductible health plans. 
Everyone with employment income may also contribute to an Individual 
Retirement Account (IRA). Your IRA contributions may not be immediately 
tax-deductible if your (or your spouse’s) employer offers a retirement 
account or pension plan.
If you’ve exhausted your options for contributing to retirement accounts 
and an HSA, and if you find it challenging to save money anyway, the 15-year 
mortgage may offer you a good forced-savings program. If you elect to take a 
30-year mortgage, you retain the flexibility to pay it off faster if you so choose. 
(Just be sure to avoid those mortgages that have a prepayment penalty.) 
Constraining yourself with the 15-year mortgage’s higher monthly payments 
does carry a risk. If you fall on tough financial times, you may not be able to 
meet the required mortgage payments.
Getting a Loan When Rates Are High
In the past 30 years, we’ve seen interest rates for conforming 30-year, fixed-
rate loans soar to more than 18 percent in the early 1980s and sink to a low 
of 5.25 percent in 2004. We can guarantee you with 100-percent certainty that 
mortgage rates will change. They always do. If we could only figure out a way 
to forecast how much and when, we’d be rich!
Earlier in this chapter, we point out three places to find a first mortgage with 
an interest rate significantly lower than what you’d pay for a new, 30-year, 
fixed-rate loan. Just to refresh your memory, here’s a recap:
 
 ARMs: Lenders charge a premium for fixed-rate loans. If you’ll share 
the lenders’ risk of possible future interest rate increases by getting an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, lenders will reward your adventurous spirit 
with a lower initial interest rate on your loan. The more often your loan 
adjusts, the lower your ARM’s initial interest rate. ARMs that adjust 
every six months, for example, generally have a lower start rate than 
ARMs that adjust annually and so on.

98
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
 Loan assumptions: It’s extremely unlikely that you’ll find a fixed-rate 
mortgage you can assume. On the other hand, some ARMs are assumable 
for creditworthy borrowers. Nuff said.
 
 Seller financing: Some long-term homeowners no longer have mortgages 
on their property. These fortunate folks often offer attractive financing to 
qualified buyers either to get a higher purchase price or to structure their 
transaction as an installment sale for preferable tax treatment by the IRS.
Like it or not, you may have the monetary misfortune of buying your home 
during a period when mortgage rates are on the high side of the cycle. If 
that happens, don’t despair. You can refinance your loan when rates drop. 
Chapter 11 is chock-full of money-saving refinancing ideas.

his book would’ve been much shorter a couple of generations ago. 
Many of the loans we so diligently describe in Mortgages For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, hadn’t been invented when Richard Nixon was President of the 
United States.
That’s no typo. Invented is precisely what we meant to say. Loans are indeed 
invented by lenders. Adjustable-rate mortgages, which occupy a significant 
chunk of Chapter 5, and reverse mortgages, the sole topic of Chapter 12, are 
two examples of financial products that didn’t exist in the early 1970s.
We devote this chapter to a marvelous medley of mortgages designed to 
satisfy special financial requirements. If you don’t see the mortgage product 
you desire, tell your friendly financier. That’s how new loans are invented.
By the way, we use mucho loan lingo in this chapter. If you haven’t read 
Chapter 4 yet, now’s an ideal time to peruse it. Nudge. Nudge. We have many 
charms. Subtlety isn’t one of them.
Understanding Home Equity Loans
Equity is the difference between what your house is worth in today’s real 
estate market and how much you currently owe on it. For example, if your 
home’s present appraised value is $225,000 and your outstanding mortgage 
balance is $75,000, you have $150,000 of home equity. Lucky you.

100
Part II: Locating a Loan 
There’s only one tiny problem with all that equity in your home — its utter 
lack of liquidity. Having equity in your house isn’t like having money in your 
checking account or a mutual fund you can sell any day the financial markets 
are open. In order to get your hands on your home’s equity, you must figure 
out a way to extract it from the property.
For instance, suppose you seek copious quantities of cash. If that’s your 
dilemma, dear reader, we have two suggestions. You can free up all your 
equity by selling your house or tap most of it by refinancing your mortgage.
If selling is your pleasure, rush to the nearest quality bookstore for your 
very own copy of the latest edition of our book, House Selling For Dummies 
(Wiley). On the other hand, if you’d rather pull big bucks out of your home 
without selling it, you have the right book but the wrong chapter. We 
thoughtfully devote Chapter 11 to the arcane art of refinancing. This section 
tells you how to nibble into your equity by turning your home into an ATM 
machine.
Using home equity loans
Home equity loans may be excellent financial tools for homeowners who 
want to use a relatively small amount of their equity or who don’t need all 
their money at once. For example, you may need $20,000 of that $150,000 
equity to remodel your kitchen. Or perhaps your twins are heading to college 
next fall, and you’ve generously decided to pay their tuition. Folks often tap 
their home’s equity to buy a new car or pay off unexpected medical bills.
These loans are frequently called home equity lines of credit or, given the 
mortgage industry’s love of acronyms, HELOCs. Home equity line of credit is 
an appropriate term, because this type of loan is essentially a line of credit 
secured by a second mortgage on a property.
As long as you don’t exceed the maximum loan amount previously agreed to 
by you and the lender, you can borrow precisely as much money as you need 
exactly when you need it. Take all the cash in one fell swoop or dole it out as 
you desire. You pay interest only on the outstanding loan balance, not your 
total line of credit.
 
Watch out! Many home equity loans contain clauses giving lenders the 
unilateral right to cancel or suspend a line of credit. Suppose, for example, 
your lender thinks your home has declined in value due to a soft local real 
estate market. The lender can yank your line of credit. Woe be it to you 
if you just started to remodel your kitchen or were counting on using the 
equity to pay the twins’ college tuition for next fall.

101
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
 
The best defense is a good offense. Rather than living in fear that your lender 
is going to pull the HELOC partway through your project, a prudent person 
like you can get the money out while the getting is good. Withdraw all funds 
you estimate needing before starting your project or before the tuition is due. 
Put the money into an interest-bearing account (such as a money market 
mutual fund) to partially offset interest your interest charges. The gap 
between the interest you pay for the HELOC and interest you earn on the 
funds is called the opportunity cost of money.
Equity loans are also aptly referred to as debt consolidation loans. If you’re 
burdened by consumer debt from unpaid credit card balances, installment 
loans, and personal loans — and you’re a homeowner with sufficient equity 
in your property — you can use a HELOC to consolidate all your high interest 
rate loans into one relatively low monthly payment.
Operating instructions
There isn’t a standard, one-size-fits-all format for HELOCs. On the contrary, 
they can be extremely flexible financial instruments.
Depending on which lender you select, you may be able to customize your 
personal HELOC. For instance, you could get a fixed-rate loan unless, of 
course, you’d rather have an adjustable-rate mortgage. Other possible 
options are to take your money in one lump sum, or to use an ATM card to 
make withdrawals whenever you need cash, or to write checks on your credit 
line — it’s up to you. You can opt to repay the funds you borrow in a fully 
amortized loan program or make interest-only payments until your loan is 
due. What’s your pleasure?
 
However, one common thread does run through these infinitely variable 
HELOCs: Every one of them is firmly secured by a lien on your home.
Because home equity loans are second mortgages, they have higher interest 
rates than first mortgages. That extra charge is fair because, from a lender’s 
perspective, second mortgages are inherently riskier than firsts. Even so, 
interest rates on HELOCs are generally significantly lower than interest rates 
charged on credit cards. A home equity loan at 9-percent interest, for exam-
ple, sure beats paying 19.8-percent interest — or more — on credit card debt.
 
You’ll probably get the best interest rate on a home equity loan from the 
lender who currently holds the first mortgage on your home. As a rule, you’ll 
get the lowest interest rate if the total amount of your first mortgage plus the 
HELOC doesn’t exceed 75 percent of your home’s fair market value (FMV). For 
example, suppose your home is worth $200,000 and you have an existing first 
mortgage of $130,000 on it. To obtain the most favorable financial terms in this 
case, you’d limit the HELOC to $20,000 ($200,000 × 75 percent = $150,000 less 
your $130,000 first mortgage).

102
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
If your FICO score is over 700, some lenders will allow you to tap up to 80 
percent of your home’s FMV for the first mortgage plus HELOC. We cover 
how to improve your credit score in Chapter 3.  
 
You can lose your home if you don’t repay a HELOC. Unlike department 
store charge accounts, credit card debt, student loans, and other unsecured 
liabilities, home equity loans permit lenders to foreclose on property when 
borrowers default. And, if the total of your first mortgage plus the equity loan 
exceeds 80 percent of your home’s fair market value, you’ll pay higher loan 
origination fees and a higher mortgage interest rate on your HELOC. Be sure 
to review Chapter 1 so that you understand how much mortgage debt you 
can truly afford given your overall financial situation and goals.
Lenders can play hardball on home equity loans
In the heady days of the 1990s and early 2000s 
when housing prices seemed like they only 
went up, some folks thought their homes were 
3-bedroom, 2-bath ATMs. Home equity loans 
boomed as borrowers and lenders just couldn’t 
get enough of them. Homeowners enjoyed 
tapping their increasing wealth for new living 
room furniture, snazzy televisions, home 
improvements, and paying off high-cost 
consumer debt. Banks loved making home 
equity loans because they were so profitable.
When property values began to fall in the late 
2000s, lenders justifiably became concerned 
about getting their money back. As we note 
in Chapter 4, in the highly unlikely case that a 
prudent borrower such as yourself falls behind 
in your mortgage payments, your lender has the 
legal right to sell your house and use the proceeds 
of sale to repay your loan. Mortgages are 
always paid off in the same order they were put 
on the property. The first mortgage used to buy 
your home would, therefore, be repaid before a 
HELOC secured by a second mortgage.
For example, say you paid $200,000 for your 
home in 1998. You put $40,000 (20 percent) cash 
down and got a $160,000 first mortgage. In 2005, 
your house appraised for $240,000. You took 
out a $20,000 home equity loan to remodel your 
kitchen. You got a great interest rate on your 
HELOC because the combined loan-to-value 
ratio for your first and second mortgage was 
only 75 percent of your home’s fair market value 
($180,000 divided by $240,000).
Unfortunately, property values fell in recent 
years in your town. Today your house is worth 
$160,000, almost $20,000 less than the current 
combined total of your first and second mortgage. 
If you default on your loan, the holder of your 
first mortgage could foreclose and pay off the 
first loan with money from the sale. Your HELOC 
lender would get nothing. This is called a short 
sale because the proceeds fall short of enough 
money to pay off both loans.
In situations like this, HELOC lenders aren’t going 
down without a fight. They have a surprising 
amount of power to make life more miserable 
for you and the holder of the first mortgage. 
Your lender can, for instance, refuse to let you 
refinance your first mortgage unless you pay off 
some of your home equity loan. Your lender can 
refuse to go along with the short sale unless 
the lender in first position pays them some of 
the money due on the HELOC. Your lender can 
also hire a collection agency to go after your 
other assets. Last, but not least, your bad loan 
remains a blemish on your credit record, which 
makes it more difficult for you to borrow in the 
future (a topic we cover in Chapter 3).

 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
Considering tax consequences
All people are created equal. All debt isn’t. For example, the interest charged for 
student loans, credit card debt, and car loans is classified as consumer interest. 
This distinction is noteworthy because consumer interest isn’t tax deductible.
Mortgage interest, on the other hand, generally is tax deductible. One of a 
home equity loan’s most appealing features is that the interest you pay on 
a HELOC may be deductible for both federal and state income tax purposes. 
Whether the interest actually is deductible depends on two IRS tests:
 
 The $100,000 test: There’s a $100,000 limit on tax deductibility of home 
equity indebtedness. You won’t go to jail or lose all your hair if your 
HELOC exceeds $100,000. The amount could be $10 million, and your 
kindly old Uncle Sam wouldn’t care. Any interest charged on the portion 
of your equity loan in excess of $100,000, however, will be classified as 
consumer interest, which isn’t tax deductible.
 
 The market value test: The IRS says that deductible home equity 
indebtedness can’t exceed the fair market value of your home. For 
now, be advised that interest charged for any amount you borrow in 
excess of your home’s current value is not tax deductible.
The amount of debt taken out on the home when it was acquired and the 
dreaded alternative minimum tax (AMT) may also limit the amount of home 
equity interest you can deduct. Chapter 9 covers the complexities of mortgage 
interest deductibility in awesome detail. However, these details have a way of 
changing. Because Congress takes devilish delight in continually revising U.S. 
income tax rules and regulations, it may be prudent to review the nuances of 
your specific situation with a tax advisor.
Eyeing 100-Percent Home Equity Loans
As we note in Chapter 2, lenders have a disarmingly simple technique to 
estimate the probable risk of a mortgage. They divide the loan amount by a 
property’s appraised value to get a loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Referring back 
to our previous example, your home’s loan-to-value ratio is 60 percent if the 
appraised value is $150,000 and you have an existing $90,000 mortgage on it 
($90,000 divided by $150,000).
The lower the LTV ratio, the lower a lender’s risk of being unable to col-
lect enough money from a foreclosure sale to repay the loan if a borrower 
defaults — and vice versa. Lenders compensate for riskier loans by increas-
ing interest rates and loan fees when a conventional mortgage’s LTV ratio 
exceeds 80 percent. High-risk borrowers must also pay for private mortgage 
insurance to protect lenders from losses. High LTV loans aren’t cheap.

104
Part II: Locating a Loan 
When Ray began his real estate career in 1974, 95-percent loan-to-value 
financing was the steel-reinforced concrete ceiling for conventional mortgages. 
During the crazy lending days in the 1990s and early 2000s, some loans were 
being done up to 125 percent or more of the home’s value. Now, some financial 
institutions will lend creditworthy borrowers up to 100-percent of their home’s 
value.
 
Consider the toxic consequences of 100-percent HELOCs:
 
 High monthly payments: Given the extraordinarily high level of risk 
associated with this loan, it has correspondingly high interest rates. For 
example, if the prevailing market rate on a prime 80-percent LTV ratio, 
30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage is 8 percent, don’t be surprised if your 
accommodating neighborhood lender wants 12 to 18 percent interest for 
a 100-percent HELOC.
 
 Limited tax deduction: You can’t write off any of the interest charges on 
any portion of the HELOC loan that exceeds 100 percent of your home’s 
appraised value at the time the loan was taken out.
 
 You may not be able to sell: Factoring in the significant transaction costs 
involved in selling a house, you can’t pay off a 100-percent HELOC loan 
by selling your house if the home is worth about the same as when you 
took out the 100-percent HELOC. You’re stuck in your home whether you 
like it or not. You’ll have to find another source of cash to cover the debt 
if unforeseen circumstances force you to sell. If all your piggy banks are 
empty, you’ll have to file bankruptcy and suffer the long-term damage to 
your credit. Your choices range from awful to dreadful.
 
 They encourage additional consumer debt: People typically take out 
100-percent loans to relieve themselves from the burden of high payments 
on their credit card debt. However, what the salespeople hawking these 
100-percent loans don’t tell you is that over time many of these borrowers 
ultimately run up their credit card and other consumer debts again, which 
places them even deeper in the credit abyss.
 
You can probably get a better deal on some lower-interest-rate credit cards 
than on a 100-percent loan — and without placing your home at risk of 
foreclosure. Because credit card rates vary from bank to bank, do some 
comparison shopping.
Getting a 100-percent loan may be prudent if you use the proceeds to 
pay off other debt with an even more outrageous interest rate, such as 
an unsecured loan to pay for a medical emergency. On the other hand, 
if you need a 100-percent loan to pay for a dream vacation in Hawaii or 
buy a spiffy new car (when you have a perfectly good one sitting in your 
garage), you’re exhibiting ominous signs of a severe credit management 
predicament. Be sure to read the sidebar “Pay attention: Warning signs of 
credit trouble.”

105
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
Pay attention: Warning signs of credit trouble
Getting a high-interest-rate HELOC loan to 
consolidate credit card debt won’t necessarily 
solve your fiscal problems. If the only step 
you take to lower your monthly payments is to 
stretch out the length of time you take to repay 
the debt, you’ll end up paying even more in 
total interest charges. Worse yet, you’ll convert 
unsecured credit card debt into mortgage debt 
secured by your house. That puts your home in 
jeopardy of foreclosure if you don’t make the 
scheduled monthly loan payments.
You’re already in serious credit trouble if you 
experience six or more of the following behaviors:
  Paying only the minimum amount due on 
your credit cards.
  Charging more each month than you make 
in payments.
  Using credit and cash advances for items 
such as groceries, gas, and insurance that 
you used to pay for with cash.
  Having a total credit balance that rarely 
decreases.
  Being at or near your credit limit and applying 
for new cards.
  Needing a consolidation loan to pay existing 
debt.
  Not knowing the total amount you owe.
  Experiencing feelings of anxiety and stress 
whenever you use your charge cards.
  Draining your savings to pay debts.
  Making bill payments late.
Getting into debt over your head usually doesn’t 
happen overnight. It’s an insidious process. 
Answer the following questions to see if you’re 
headed for a serious problem:
  Are your debts making your home life 
unhappy?
  Does the pressure of your debts distract 
you from work and sleep?
  Are your debts affecting your reputation?
  Do your debts cause you to think less of 
yourself?
  Have you ever given false information in 
order to obtain credit?
  Have you ever made unrealistic promises to 
your creditors?
  Do you ever fear that your employer, family, 
or friends will discover the extent of your 
indebtedness?
  When faced with a difficult financial 
situation, does the prospect of borrowing 
give you an inordinate feeling of relief?
  Has the pressure of your debts ever caused 
you to consider getting drunk?
  Have you ever borrowed money without 
considering the rate of interest?
  Do you expect a negative response when 
subject to a credit investigation?
  Have you ever developed a strict regimen 
for paying your debts, only to break it?
  Do you justify your debts by telling yourself 
that you’re superior to “other” people, and 
when you get your “break,” you’ll be out of 
debt?
If some of these danger signs describe your 
current predicament, get serious about dealing 
with your debt and spending challenges. One 
way to start is by getting the most recent 
edition of Eric’s Personal Finance For Dummies

Part II: Locating a Loan 
Taking a Closer Look at Co-Op Loans
Cooperative apartments, usually called co-ops, can be difficult to finance. 
Wait. Why sugarcoat the situation? On our patented mortgage-origination-
degree-of-difficulty scale, where 1 equals a slam dunk and 10 will never 
happen in your lifetime no matter how much you beguile, beg, and beseech 
lenders, getting a co-op loan is 9.8 nearly anywhere in the United States.
That fact no doubt seems odd when you consider that condominium financing 
is generally affordable and plentiful. Condos and co-ops are, after all, the two 
most common types of attached residential dwelling units. You can’t tell which 
is which simply by looking at a building’s exterior. Why, then, is financing 
co-ops so tough when getting condominium loans is relatively easy?
We thought you’d never ask.
Identifying the legal structure 
of co-op loans
The first reason why obtaining co-op financing is more difficult than financing 
a condo is that even though a condominium development and a cooperative 
apartment building may look identical physically, they have different legal 
structures:
 
 Condominiums: When you buy a condo, you get a deed to your individual 
unit; you own real property. Lenders like that. They’re inordinately fond 
of real property because they can use it as security for repayment of 
mortgage debt.
 
 Cooperatives: When you buy a co-op, you don’t get a deed to your unit. 
Instead, you’re issued a fancy stock certificate proving to the world that 
you own a specified number of shares in the cooperative corporation. 
In addition, you get a proprietary lease that entitles you to occupy the 
apartment you bought. You do not, however, own any real property a 
lender can use to secure your mortgage. This deviation from normal 
residential real estate practices deeply disturbs almost all lenders.
 
About now you’re probably wondering whether cooperative apartments are 
some kind of ultraexpensive shell game. If you don’t own the real property, 
who does? We’ll give you a hint. The owner is an it, not a who. Give up? The 
cooperative corporation owns the building in which your cooperative unit is 
located; it holds the property’s deed in its name. But because you own shares 
in the cooperative corporation that owns the building, that makes you a co-
owner of the building as well as a tenant in the building you partly own. Does 
the word discombobulated describe how you feel about now?

107
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
Dealing with deal-killing directors
The internal management structure is another reason that buying and selling 
co-ops is more difficult than buying and selling a condo. Stock cooperatives are 
corporations governed by a board of directors elected by individual apartment 
owners. Like the homeowners association in a condominium, a co-op’s board 
of directors is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations and financial 
planning.
The co-op’s board of directors has far more power to sell a unit than a condo’s 
homeowners association has. Many cooperatives won’t let individual owners 
sell or otherwise transfer their stock or proprietary leases without written 
consent from the board of directors or from a majority of other owners. That 
arrangement may be fine with you as a co-op owner, but it makes most lenders 
intensely uneasy. In their opinion, giving up your right to sell your apartment 
to a creditworthy buyer is far too high a price to pay for the right to select your 
future neighbors.
Buying a cooperative apartment isn’t any easier than selling one. Would-be 
buyers almost always have to provide several character references plus a 
detailed financial statement and then submit to an intrusive interrogation 
by the directors. Many people find the Byzantine approval process so 
meddlesome that they won’t consider buying a co-op. This reluctance 
further reduces the number of prospective purchasers for your unit.
Offers you receive from prospective purchasers must be conditioned 
upon subsequent approval by the board of directors. When you finally 
find the perfect buyers, brace yourself. These paragons may be rejected. 
The directors, in their infinite wisdom, may believe that your buyers have 
a propensity to entertain too frequently. Or perhaps they’re of the opinion 
that your buyers can’t afford to shoulder their share of the co-op’s operat-
ing expenses. Whatever their rationale, valid or capricious, directors can 
nix your deal.
 
If you haven’t purchased a cooperative apartment yet, think twice before 
doing so. Don’t buy someone else’s problem. If it’s difficult to find financing 
when you want to buy a co-op, and equally troublesome to find prospective 
purchasers when you want to sell it, the real estate market is trying to tell you 
something. The best time to think about selling a co-op is before you buy it.

108
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Tracking down a loan
If you’re still reading, we obviously haven’t dissuaded you. Trust us when 
we say that getting a co-op mortgage will be tough. Here’s what you’re up 
against:
 
 Lack of satisfactory security: Most lenders flatly refuse to accept shares 
of stock in a cooperative corporation as security for their mortgage. 
They want real property, which you can’t provide. The apartment 
building is, unfortunately, deeded to the co-op.
 
 Lack of cooperation: Some cooperatives won’t allow financing of individual 
units. They’ll graciously let you assume your pro-rata share of the existing 
mortgage on the building as a whole, but that’s all. These co-ops believe 
that the best proof of your creditworthiness is the ability to pay cash for 
your individual unit.
Real estate agents and cooperative apartment owners are excellent financial 
ferrets. They generally know which lenders in your area are currently making 
co-op loans. You may also be able to obtain financing if your employer puts 
in a good word for you with the lender who handles the corporate accounts. 
Some commercial banks offer co-op loans as an accommodation to an 
important business relationship.
 
We strongly advise pouring water on your burning desire to own a cooperative 
apartment if you discover that few lenders in your area offer co-op financing. 
Limited competition usually results in higher loan origination fees and interest 
rates. Things may get even worse. Suppose that no lenders are making co-op 
loans when you decide to sell? You’ll either have to delay your sale until you 
can find an all-cash buyer or carry the loan for your buyer. Owner-carry 
financing, as we point out in Chapter7, can be risky business.
Grasping Balloon Loans
Loan amortization refers to the process of repaying a debt by making periodic 
installment payments until the loan term is completed or you slip this mortal 
coil, whichever comes first. Speaking of firsts, be advised that first mortgages 
are almost always fully amortized. That’s lender jargon to describe a loan 
that will be completely repaid after you make the final, regularly scheduled, 
monthly mortgage payment. (See Chapter 4 if you want more details on loan 
amortization.)

109
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
Some second mortgages are also fully amortized. Far more frequently, 
however, second mortgages come due long before they’re anywhere 
near to being fully repaid. Any mortgage that comes due with an unpaid 
balance is known as a balloon loan. Most second mortgages are balloon 
loans.
The final monthly installment that pays off a loan’s entire remaining principal 
balance due is called a balloon payment. As you’ll discover after scanning the 
next section, balloon payments generally resemble blimps.
Because balloons bring to mind images of birthday parties and light-hearted 
frivolity, it seems somewhat misleading to name these mortgages after 
something so benign. They’re more aptly referred to as bullet loans by 
lenders who’ve seen balloon loans mutate into financial bullets blasting 
hapless borrowers who can’t repay or refinance their mortgages when they 
come due.
We don’t want to scare you away from balloon loans. They can be used to 
augment your cash for a down payment, reduce your interest charges, or 
pull equity out of your present house to buy your next home. They’re useful 
financial resources when used properly. Without further ado, the following 
sections offer a bunch of bright balloons that you can safely consider for 
your edification and judicious fiscal enjoyment.
80-10-10 financing
Surprising as it may seem, some folks with hefty incomes find that it’s mighty 
tough for them to save enough money to make a 20-percent cash down payment 
on their dream homes. Buyers using conventional financing who can’t afford to 
put 20 percent cash down must purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). As 
we gloomily note in Chapter 4, buying PMI increases the cost of home ownership 
and, ironically, makes it even more difficult to qualify for a mortgage.
Good news: You’re about to discover how you may be able to circumvent 
those nasty PMI costs with 80-10-10 financing.
Even if you put 20 percent down, you could still end up paying a higher 
interest rate on your home loan if you get a jumbo first mortgage. Per our 
succinct section in Chapter 4, these mortgages exceed the Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac conforming loan limits. In the upcoming section, “Shrinking 
jumbo can slash your interest rate,” we show you how to shave up to 
1⁄2 
percent off your first’s interest rate by using 80-10-10 financing.

110
Part II: Locating a Loan 
Using 80-10-10 financing to avoid private mortgage insurance
If you’re a dues-paying member of the cash-challenged class, don’t despair. 
Given that your income is sufficiently high, it’s eminently possible to avoid 
getting stuck with PMI (private mortgage insurance). That’s why 80-10-10 
financing was invented. It’s called 80-10-10 because a savings and loan 
association, bank, or other institutional lender provides a traditional 
80-percent first mortgage, you get a 10-percent second mortgage, and make a 
cash down payment equal to 10 percent of the home’s purchase price.
Where do you obtain the 10-percent second mortgage? The most common 
sources are:
 
 House sellers: We provide a detailed dissertation about seller financing 
in Chapter 7. At this point, we’ll just say that some sellers offer qualified 
buyers attractive secondary financing either as a sales inducement or 
because they want to generate income from the loan. Owner-carry 
second mortgages are generally less expensive than seconds made by 
institutional lenders such as banks and credit unions because most sellers 
don’t charge loan origination fees — and sellers usually offer lower 
mortgage interest rates to boot. Seller seconds are nearly always short-
term balloon loans due and payable three to five years after origination.
 
 The institutional lender that holds the first mortgage will most likely 
insist upon reviewing the terms and conditions of the owner-carry 
second mortgage. For one thing, the lender needs to be sure that you 
can afford to make monthly loan payments on the first mortgage plus 
the second without overextending yourself. The lender will also 
probably insist upon at least a five-year term for the second mortgage, 
so that you’ll have plenty of time to save up for the balloon payment 
when the second comes due.
 
 Institutional lenders: Yes, the same friendly folks who originate your 
80-percent first mortgage may also provide secondary financing. This 
type of loan program varies from lender to lender. Some lenders 
structure the second as a home equity loan; others offer a conventional 
second mortgage. The secondary financing may or may not be in the 
form of a balloon loan. If the second is fully amortized, it’s usually 
structured as a 15-year mortgage.
 
Don’t get hung up on terminology. Just because this type of financing is 
referred to as 80-10-10 doesn’t mean that you absolutely, categorically must 
put down 10-percent cash. The same principle applies if you can afford to 
make only a 5-percent down payment — 80-15-5 financing may be available. 
Because a smaller cash down payment increases the lender’s risk of default, 
however, don’t be surprised when you’re asked to pay higher loan fees and 
a higher mortgage interest rate for 80-15-5 financing and 80-10-10 financing 
versus traditional financing where you make a 20 percent down payment.

111
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
Playing with the numbers
Now we’re going to crunch some numbers so you can see with your own eyes 
80-10-10 financing. Each of the following examples assumes the same three 
conditions — that the home you’re buying costs $200,000, that you’re making 
a 10-percent ($20,000) cash down payment, and that you’re a creditworthy 
buyer:
 
 PMI: In this scenario, you didn’t read this fine book and hence don’t 
know about 80-10-10 financing. You foolishly get a $180,000 (90 percent 
of purchase price), 30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage with an 8-percent 
interest rate. Your monthly loan payment is $1,322. PMI costs an 
additional, non-tax deductible $78 per month. You pay $1,400 per month 
in total loan charges.
 
 Owner-carry second mortgage: After reading Mortgages For Dummies, 
you diligently search until you discover a seller who’ll carry a $20,000 
fixed-rate second mortgage amortized on a 30-year basis. The loan, 
however, is due in five years. You negotiate a 7.5-percent interest 
rate; your payment is $140 per month. With 10 percent down and a 
10-percent second, you need only a $160,000 (80-percent) 30-year, 
fixed-rate first mortgage at 8-percent interest costing $1,175 per month. 
Total loan charges are $1,315 a month, $85 less per month than the 
PMI example — and all the interest you pay on both mortgages is tax 
deductible. The final advantage is that you can pay off the owner-carry 
second mortgage any time you want. PMI, conversely, is harder to get 
rid of than head lice. You’re sooooooooooo smart.
 
 Not so fast, smarty. Don’t forget that the second mortgage is a balloon 
loan. It’s due and payable in five short years. Check the remaining balance 
tables in Appendix B. You’ll be dismayed to discover that 94.6 percent of 
your original $20,000 loan remains to be paid five years after the loan is 
originated. In other words, your loan balance is $18,920 ($20,000 × 94.6%) 
even after paying the seller $8,400 (60 monthly payments of $140) over 
five years. What if you can’t refinance the second mortgage when it’s 
due because you lose your job? Or what if property values drop and the 
appraisal comes in too low to pay off the second? Or what if interest rates 
skyrocket and you can’t qualify for a new loan at the high mortgage rates? 
Now maybe you understand why they’re called bullet loans.
 
 Institutional lender second mortgage: In this example, the seller of 
your dream home won’t carry a second. Having scrutinized this book, 
you wisely opt for 80-10-10 financing from a bank. You get a $160,000 
(80-percent) 30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage at 8-percent inter-
est costing $1,175 per month. The bank offers you a choice for your 
$20,000 second — either a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) amortized over 
30 years but due in 15 or a fully amortized, fixed-rate, 15-year loan. 
You’d pay $191 per month for the 30-year, FRM balloon loan with an 
11-percent interest rate versus $225 a month for the 15-year FRM at 
10.75-percent interest. What to do? What to do?

112
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
 What an interesting (sorry — we couldn’t resist) choice. You’d pay 
$1,366 per month ($1,175 + $191) for an 80-10-10 that has a $16,760 
balloon payment due in 15 years. Taking the fully amortized second 
mortgage increases your monthly payment $34 to a nice round $1,400 
($1,175 + $225). On the plus side, you’d build up equity faster with that 
second mortgage, and there’s no balloon payment to fret about. (If 
that kind of fiscal pressure debilitates you, either of the bank’s second 
mortgages are preferable to the owner-carry second with its five-year 
due date.)
 
 Truth be known, it’s highly unlikely you’d keep either of the second 
mortgages for 15 years. Given their high interest rate, you’d wisely 
refinance the one you select as soon as possible (see Chapter 11) or 
pay it off when you sell your house and move into a magnificent 
mansion.
 
 Given those assumptions, we’d advise taking the balloon second 
mortgage and investing the $34 a month you save in a good mutual 
fund. If the thought of balloon payments causes you to lose shuteye, 
however, you have our permission to take the fully amortized second. 
The choice is yours.
Shrinking jumbo can slash your interest rate
Congress sets upper limits on mortgages Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
purchase from institutional lenders for resale to private investors. These loan 
limits are adjusted annually to insure that they accurately reflect changes in 
the U.S. national average home price. For example, the maximum single-family 
dwelling loan Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could buy when this book was 
printed was $729,750. That amount may have changed by now, so be sure to 
check with your lender to determine the present loan limit for the type of 
property you intend to purchase.
As we note in Chapter 4, mortgages that neatly fall within the current Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits are called conforming loans. Conventional 
mortgages over the maximum permissible loan amounts are referred to as 
jumbo conforming or true jumbo loans. This is a critically important financial 
distinction if your mortgage happens to exceed the conforming loan limit. 
Interest rates on jumbo conforming or true jumbo fixed-rate mortgages are 
normally 
1⁄2 to 1
1⁄2 percent higher than their conforming fixed-rate brethren.
 
Why pay one red cent more than you have to for your home loan? If the 
amount of money you need to borrow is slightly over the Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac current conforming loan limit, use the 80-10-10 financing 
technique to cut that costly jumbo loan down to size.

Bridge loans
It’s highly unlikely that you’ll remain in your first home forever. Sooner or 
later birth, death, marriage, divorce, job transfers, retirement, or another 
monumental life change will probably force you to confront the eternal 
seller’s quandary — should you sell your present house before buying a 
new one or buy first and then sell?
There are, of course, risks associated with either course of action. However, we 
firmly believe that it’s ultimately far less pecuniarily perilous to either sell your 
current house before buying a new one or to sell your house concurrently with 
the purchase of your next dream home. You’ll also sleep a whole lot better.
Why? Because, if you’re like most mortals, you can’t afford the luxury of 
owning two homes simultaneously. You have to use the proceeds from the 
sale of your present house to acquire your next home. That’s how things 
work in the real estate food chain.
Unfortunately, some folks create serious problems for themselves by 
purchasing a new home before their old one has sold — which brings us 
to bridge loans, a type of balloon loan that enables qualified borrowers to 
pull a portion of the equity out of their house before it sells. This financial 
bridge provides enough cash to complete the purchase. We’re not fans of 
bridge loans. If you’re not careful, they can be the fiscal equivalent of a 
dose of arsenic. Here’s why:
 
 Bridge loans aren’t cheap. Because a bridge loan is usually a second 
mortgage or HELOC (home equity line of credit), its loan origination fee 
and interest rate will be significantly higher than the amount you’d pay 
for a conventional first mortgage. A bridge loan’s interest rate is directly 
related to the combined loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the existing first 
mortgage on the house you’re selling plus the bridge loan.
 
 You’ll get the best possible interest rate on the bridge loan if you keep 
the total amount of your old house’s existing first mortgage plus bridge 
loan under 80 percent of the house’s fair market value. From a risk 
assessment standpoint, lenders know that their risk of loan default 
increases markedly when the LTV ratio exceeds 80 percent.
 
 Your cash may drain away. You may think that your house will sell 
quickly. But if you’re wrong, you could end up owning two houses longer 
than you anticipated. How many months, for instance, can you afford to 
pay three mortgages (first mortgage plus bridge loan on your old house 
and first mortgage on your new home), two property tax bills, two 
homeowners insurance premiums, and two sets of utility bills? How long 
will you be able to continue maintaining two houses, especially if they’re 
located in two different towns? You may discover that you no longer 
own the houses — they own you. First the houses will consume all your 
disposable income, and then they’ll gobble up your savings.

114
Part II: Locating a Loan 
 
 You could lose everything. If property prices decline while you’re trying 
to dump the old house, you may not be able to sell it for enough money to 
pay off the outstanding loans. In that case, the holder of the bridge loan 
may be able to foreclose on your new home to make up the shortfall.
Bridge loans are fine if you’re wealthy enough to afford owning two houses 
for an extended period of time. We grudgingly authorize the use of a bridge 
loan in one other situation — if the house you’re selling has a ratified offer on 
it, if your transaction is currently in escrow, if all the conditions of your sale 
have been removed, and if the sale will be completed in four weeks or less. 
Even under these stringent conditions, a bridge loan is risky because your 
deal could fall through.
 
Like rattlesnakes, bridge loans should be approached with extreme caution. 
Consider them a last resort. Stifle the unseemly urge to obtain bridge financing 
so you can buy your dream home before selling your present house. A bridge 
loan could turn that dream into a nightmare.
Construction loans
Watch your step, please. Be careful. We’re about to enter a hardhat zone. 
This last balloon loan is covered with a fine coat of dust — construction dust. 
Hack. Cough.
Like the other loans we cover in this chapter, construction financing is 
extremely diverse. No one standard loan instrument exists that all lenders 
use to finance construction projects. On the contrary, the terms and 
conditions of construction financing vary widely from lender to lender and 
project to project.
That variability isn’t at all surprising when you consider the full spectrum 
of project types and sites. Do you need a small loan to do a little cosmetic 
painting and landscaping around your house; or are you about to embark 
upon a major rehab of an inner-city, multifamily dwelling; or do you plan to 
construct a country retreat from the ground up? Will your project be 
completed in two months or two years? Are you doing the work yourself or 
will you use an architect and licensed contractors?
Financing for small, do-it-yourself type projects is usually handled with home 
equity loans. Funding of larger projects, on the other hand, is generally paid 
out in installments as each previously agreed upon stage of construction 
is satisfactorily completed. You pay interest on construction funds only as 
they’re disbursed. After your project is completed, the construction financing 
is customarily converted into a permanent, long-term mortgage.

115
 Chapter 6: Surveying Special Situation Loans
 
Construction financing is specialized. Many lenders aren’t interested in 
financing rehabs of major fixer-uppers or making new construction loans. 
Real estate agents who handle this kind of property generally know which 
local financial institutions offer construction loans for your specific type of 
project. Architects and contractors are also good bird dogs for local banks or 
savings and loan associations who provide construction loans.

H
opefully, you’re enjoying a fair weather day or the company of family 
or friends as you read our book. Now, close your eyes and think about 
shopping for something fun and exciting. Maybe a new summer outfit, a car, 
a vacation, a hot tub, or a new set of golf clubs. Surely, you didn’t think of 
shopping for a mortgage!
However, unless you enjoy throwing away thousands of dollars, you need to 
shop around for the best deal on a mortgage. Whether you do the footwork 
yourself or hire someone competent and ethical to help you doesn’t matter. 
But you must make sure that this comparison shopping gets done.
For example, suppose you’re in the market for a $150,000, 30-year, fixed-rate 
mortgage. If, through persistent and wise shopping, you discover a mortgage 
with a 7.5-percent interest rate when the prevailing market rate is 8 percent, 
that insignificant little half-of-1-percent difference in your loan’s interest rate 
saves you an impressive $15,120 over the 30 years you have the loan.
Obviously, the more you borrow, the more you stand to save by shopping. 
(But don’t make the mistake of thinking that if you’re borrowing relatively 
little because that’s all you can afford, there’s less value in saving a little 
interest. If you can only afford to borrow comparatively little, you’re in no 
position to be throwing money away!)
So, although we’re the first to admit that shopping for a mortgage is among 
the least fun things to do when you have a day off, get motivated to do it! 
Shopping smart means saving big bucks that you can put toward the more 
interesting and enjoyable activities in your life. This chapter can get you 
motivated.

Part III: Landing a Lender 
Going with a Mortgage Broker 
or Lender Direct?
Yes, thousands of mortgage lenders are out there. However, not anywhere 
near that many mortgage lenders are good lenders or the best lenders for 
you. Although we encourage you to find the lowest-cost lenders, we must 
first issue a caution: If someone offers you a deal that’s much better than any 
other lender’s, be skeptical. Such a lender may be baiting you with a loan that 
doesn’t exist, one that has hidden charges or other onerous terms, or one for 
which you can’t qualify.
Also, if you think back to other services or products you’ve bought, you 
know the wisdom of considering the features and services you receive in 
addition to cost. Even if you find a low-cost loan from a lender with great 
service, if the loan doesn’t meet your needs and personal situation, it’s not 
the best loan for you.
One of the first decisions you face in the loan-shopping process is deciding 
whether to shop on your own or to hire a mortgage broker to do the mort-
gage shopping for you. The following sections help you make that decision.
Considerations when using brokers
Mortgage brokers are intermediaries, independent of banks or other financial 
institutions that actually have money to lend. Mortgage brokers don’t have 
money to lend nor can they say yay or nay to your loan application. They do, 
however, originate, that is, process loan applications.
Mortgage brokers will tell you that they can get you the best loan deal by 
shopping among many lenders. They may further argue that another benefit 
of using their service is that they can explain the multitude of loan choices, 
help you select a loan, and help you wade through the morass of paperwork 
required to get a loan. Some of the time, these assertions are accurate; but 
you need to know at what cost these services are provided.
If your credit history and ability to qualify for a mortgage are marginal, a 
good mortgage broker can help polish your application and steer you to the 
few lenders that may offer you a loan. Brokers can also help if lenders don’t 
want to make loans on unusual properties that you’re interested in buying. 
For example, many lenders don’t like dealing with shared-ownership housing 
options such as co-ops and tenancies-in-common (see Chapter 6). Mortgage 
brokers may also be able to help you if you seek to borrow 90 percent or 
more of the value of a property.

121
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Best Lender
How brokers are paid
So how much do you pay a mortgage broker to get you a loan that meets 
your needs? Mortgage brokers typically receive a slice of the amount that 
you borrow — usually about 1 percent, although it may be as low as 0.5 
percent on big loans and as much as 2 percent on small loans. (You may 
actually make an out-of-pocket payment directly to the broker.)
Thus, if you’re going to use a mortgage broker, you must keep in mind 
that conflicts of interest are inherent, because such brokers are paid a 
commission just like stockbrokers and salespeople at car dealerships. 
For example, the more you borrow, the more the mortgage broker makes. 
Furthermore, some lenders pay higher commissions on certain loans 
(their more profitable ones, not surprisingly) to encourage mortgage 
brokers to push them. The actual lender may also pay the broker an 
additional fee if you pay a higher interest rate.
 
If you use a broker, make sure that all commissions, fees, and lender rebates 
are disclosed to you in writing.
Do brokers add to your costs?
Although mortgage brokers earn their living from commissions, that doesn’t 
necessarily mean that using a mortgage broker always adds to your costs of 
obtaining a loan. The interest rate and points for most mortgages obtained 
through a broker may well be the same as you’d pay a lender directly. 
Lenders reason that they can afford to share their normal fees with an 
outside mortgage broker who isn’t employed by the bank, because if you had 
gotten the loan directly from the bank, you would have had to work with and 
take up the time of one of the bank’s own mortgage employees.
 
Some lenders, including those with the lowest rates, don’t market through 
mortgage brokers. And sometimes a loan obtained through a mortgage broker 
can end up costing you more than if you had gotten it directly from the lender; 
for example, if the mortgage broker is taking a big commission or extra fees 
for himself.
 
If you’re on the fence about using a mortgage broker, take this simple test: If 
you’re the type of person who dreads shopping and waits until the last minute 
to buy a gift, a good mortgage broker can probably help you and save you 
money. A competent mortgage broker can be of greatest value to people who 
don’t bother shopping around for a good deal or folks who may be shunned, 
due to credit blemishes, by most lenders.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare the mortgages you find with 
the deals the brokers say they can get for you. Be aware, though, that some 
brokers tell you only what you want to hear — that they can beat your best 

122
Part III: Landing a Lender 
find. Later, you may discover that the broker isn’t able to deliver when the 
time comes. If you find a good deal on your own and want to check with a 
mortgage broker to see what he or she has to offer, you may be wise not to 
tell the broker the terms of the best deal you’ve found. If you do, more than a 
few brokers always come up with a mortgage that they say can beat it.
Developing a list of brokers and lenders
Whether you choose to work with a mortgage broker or go to lenders 
directly, develop a short list of the best candidates for comparison purposes. 
The following sections offer our time-tested methods for making that short 
list as strong as possible, thus maximizing your chances of ending up with 
the cream of the crop.
Collecting referrals
You can find plenty of mortgage lenders and brokers in most communities. 
Although having a large number of choices means competition, you may have 
a hard time deciding where to turn. You could mount the yellow pages listing 
on your dartboard, but we’d prefer the odds to be stacked in your favor!
Of the various major institutional players in the mortgage marketplace — 
banks, savings and loan associations, and mortgage bankers — only mortgage 
bankers focus exclusively on mortgages, and the best mortgage bankers offer 
quite competitive rates. Smaller banks and savings and loans can have good 
deals, as well. The bigger banks, whose names you’re likely to recognize from 
the millions they spend on advertising, usually don’t offer the best rates.
Real estate agents and others in the real estate trade, as well as other 
borrowers you know, can serve as useful references for steering you toward 
the top-notch mortgage lenders and away from the losers. If you do a good 
job selecting a real estate agent (a process that we describe in excruciating 
detail in our bestselling books Home Buying For Dummies and House Selling 
For Dummies, published by Wiley), your agent should help. Also consult 
people you know who can recommend the best people in real estate and 
related fields — this list could include tax advisors, attorneys, financial 
advisors, property managers, real estate investors, title insurance compa-
nies, escrow companies, and so on.
 
Never blindly accept someone’s lender recommendation as gospel. Some 
people in the real estate trade — or any other trade for that matter — may 
simply refer you to others who scratch their backs and may not offer the best 
mortgage loans. For example, Mike the mortgage lender may always refer 
people needing tax advice to his buddy Tom the tax advisor. So, when one 
of Tom’s clients is looking for a mortgage lender, Tom returns the favor even 
though he hasn’t the slightest clue about the mortgage rates and types of 
loans his buddy Mike offers.

123
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Best Lender
 
Likewise, be aware that some real estate agents may refer you to lenders that 
don’t have the best mortgage rates and programs in town. These real estate 
agents may not be up-to-date with who has the best loans, may not be into 
shopping around, or may have become comfortable doing business with 
certain lenders. Some real estate sales firms may have a mortgage company 
owned by the same parent company. Be cautious if you’re directed to its in-
house lender. You get the idea.
In addition to asking people in real estate–related fields for mortgage lender 
or broker referrals, also ask your friends and colleagues who don’t work in 
real estate and related fields. You may get some excellent ideas for whom to 
contact, especially if your friends have recently shopped for a mortgage loan 
in your area.
Just as we caution you about forging ahead with mortgage lenders recom-
mended by real estate folks, we also urge some skepticism about referrals 
from your aunt Martha and work pal Charlie. When it comes to mortgages, 
Martha and Charlie may be complete nitwits. They may not know the 
difference between an adjustable-rate mortgage and an aardvark!
 
Whenever somebody recommends a specific mortgage lender or mortgage 
broker, always ask why. The answers often prove enlightening. A world of 
difference stands between someone saying that they chose a given lender 
because it’s the same bank where they have their checking account and they 
did no shopping around versus someone who chose a lender from among ten 
because that lender provided lower rates and better service.
Finding lender lists
Another method for adding names to your menu of prospective lenders is 
to peruse the various lists of lenders you may find in print or by using your 
computer:
 
 Newspaper real estate sections: Most larger newspaper real estate 
sections carry tables of selected lenders’ mortgage loans (look in the 
weekend or Sunday edition). Don’t assume, however, that such tables 
contain the best mortgage loans available. Many of these tables are 
sent to newspapers for free by publicity-seeking firms that distribute 
information to mortgage brokers. With that in mind, go ahead and 
peruse these tables for lenders offering the most competitive rates.
 
 HSH Associates: This company publishes, for a nominal fee, weekly lists 
of dozens of lenders’ rate quotes for most metropolitan areas. Contact 
the company at 800-873-2837 or visit its Web site, www.hsh.com (which 
we discuss in Chapter 8).
 
 The Internet: Various Web sites hawk mortgage loans these days. 
Although you may find a good deal, you may also end up in the hands of 
a not-so-hot lender or worse. Please be sure to read Chapter 8, in which 
we discuss how to use (and not be abused by) mortgage Internet sites.

124
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Interviewing and working 
with mortgage brokers
In this section, we explain how you can find your way to good mortgage brokers. 
Be sure to get answers to the following questions when choosing a mortgage 
broker to work with (also, see the next section, “How to interview lenders”):
 
 How many lenders does the broker do business with, and how does 
the broker stay up-to-date with new lenders and loans that may be 
better? Some mortgage brokers, either out of habit or laziness, or for 
higher commissions, send all their business to just a few lenders instead 
of shopping around to get you the best deals. Ask brokers which lenders 
have approved the broker to represent them. Some mortgage brokers 
represent only one or two inconsequential lenders — not the kind of 
broad representation you need in order to find the best mortgage.
 
 How knowledgeable is the broker about the loan programs, and does the 
broker have the patience to explain all of a loan’s important features? 
The more lenders a mortgage broker represents, the less likely the broker 
is to know the nuances of every loan. Ask how long the broker has been 
in business. Be especially wary of a salesperson who aggressively pushes 
certain loan programs and glosses over or ignores the important points we 
discuss in this book for evaluating particular mortgages.
 
 Head for cover if a prospective mortgage broker pushes you toward 
balloon loans (see Chapter 6) and negative amortization loans (see 
Chapter 5). Balloon loans, which become fully due and payable a few 
years after you get them, are dangerous, because you may not be 
able to get new financing and could be forced to sell your property. 
Negative amortization occurs when your outstanding loan balance 
increases every month even though you keep making your regular 
monthly mortgage payments — double ouch!
 
 What’s the mortgage broker’s commission? As we mention in the last 
section, mortgage brokers typically get a commission in the range of 0.5 
to 2 percent of the amount borrowed. The commission a mortgage broker 
receives from the lender isn’t set in stone and is completely negotiable, 
especially on larger loans. On a $75,000 loan, a 1-percent commission 
comes to $750. The same commission percentage on a $300,000 loan (four 
times bigger) amounts to a $3,000 cut for the broker. A four-times-larger 
loan doesn’t take four times as much of the mortgage broker’s time. You 
have every right to ask the mortgage broker what her take is. Ask for this 
information in writing. Remember, it’s your money. You should negotiate 
with mortgage brokers, especially on larger loan amounts. Remember that 
some brokers have been known to push programs with super-high interest 
rates and points, which provide fatter commissions for the broker. This 
problem occurs most frequently with borrowers who have questionable 
credit or other qualification problems.

125
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Best Lender
 
 If a mortgage broker won’t disclose her commission, and lender-paid 
rebates (which should be revealed in the Good Faith Estimate), we say 
don’t work with her. At the loan closing, after all, you’re going to see the 
broker’s cut on the loan settlement statement anyway.
If your mortgage broker quotes you a better deal than you’ve found else-
where in your shopping, ask who the lender is. In most cases, you can 
check with the actual lender to verify the interest rate and points that the 
broker quoted. However, most brokers, fearing that you may go directly 
to the named lender and bypass the broker’s services, refuse to divulge 
the lender’s identity until you pay the few hundred dollars to cover the 
appraisal and credit report.
 
If you discover, by calling the lender directly, that it doesn’t offer such 
attractive terms to its customers, don’t leap to the conclusion that the 
mortgage broker lied to you. In rare cases, a mortgage broker may offer you 
a slightly better deal than you could have gotten on your own. However, if 
the broker was playing games to get your business, charging the broker’s 
upfront fee on your credit card allows you to dispute the charge and get 
your money back.
Figuring out how to interview lenders
In Chapter 9, we provide some handy-dandy worksheets that allow you 
to compare various lenders mortgage programs. Our goal in this section 
is to help you narrow the list of candidates you’re considering. As you’re 
screening lenders you may work with, you can also begin finding out 
about loan programs, interest rates, and other loan terms. We strongly 
recommend that you read Chapter 9 before you start calling lenders or 
mortgage brokers.
Whether you’re shopping for a mortgage broker or a lender, the following 
questions should come in handy:
 
 What types of loans does the mortgage lender or broker specialize in? 
The right lender for you is one that understands and has lots of experi-
ence with the type of real estate property that you want to finance. For 
example, if you’re buying a co-op in a big city, a lender that focuses on 
lending to single-family home and condo owners in the surrounding 
suburbs likely won’t have the best programs and be able to deliver the 
mortgage you need on time. This is a concern whether you’re talking 
with a mortgage lender or mortgage broker, but comes up more often 
with brokers. In the quest to find the loan with the lowest possible inter-
est rate, an inexperienced mortgage broker may end up trying to place 
your loan with a lender that doesn’t offer mortgages for the type of prop-
erty you want to buy.

126
Part III: Landing a Lender 
 
 How does the lender’s loan approval process work? Specifically, who’s 
involved in the approval and where are these people located? The best 
lenders approve loans locally and don’t send your loan application to 
a mammoth, out-of-state, corporate headquarters where some faceless 
committee decides on the fate of your loan application based upon 
whether it lands right-side up on the table after being tossed in the air. 
Good lenders should roll up their sleeves to help you get loan approval, 
warn you in advance of possible problems, and suggest solutions that 
will help you get the best loan and terms possible.
 
 How competitive are the lender’s rates? You won’t be able to answer 
this question well until you talk with various lenders and comparison 
shop. As we say earlier in this chapter, just because lenders boast about 
low rates doesn’t mean that they can deliver on their promises or that 
their lower rates will make up for shoddy service. If you narrow your 
selections down to a couple of lenders or brokers, don’t hesitate to 
ask the lender that you like best to match the rate of the lowest-priced 
lender you find. Loan rates and charges are negotiable. You have 
nothing to lose by asking.
 
 Be sure to ask the lender for a written estimate of all loan costs and fees 
prior to signing your loan application. Getting such estimates from all 
lenders you’re considering enables you to cut through the inevitable 
sales pitch you hear from lenders about how competitive their rates are. 
See Chapter 9 for more information on comparing various lenders’ 
mortgage offerings.
 
 Does the lender speak your language and candidly answer your 
questions? Good, ethical mortgage lenders and brokers can clearly 
explain their loan programs without using jargon or verbal obfuscation. 
They’ll candidly disclose all fees and answer all reasonable questions. 
A major red flag is if you ask a question and don’t get a follow-up 
response, which either indicates that you’re dealing with someone 
evasive or who lacks follow-up. Good lenders meet deadlines, which 
is especially critical if your loan is for a home purchase. Missed dead-
lines can sabotage your purchase. If you’re refinancing to lower your 
loan rate, delays cost you money and could cause you to miss out on 
capturing low rates if rates rise during a lender’s delays.
In addition to questioning lenders and mortgage brokers you’re considering 
working with, after you narrow down your search to the two or three strongest 
candidates, ask for customer references. Use the same questions in the 
preceding list to select the winner.

127
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Best Lender
Seller Financing: The Trials 
and Tribulations
In addition to borrowing through traditional mortgage lenders and brokers, 
you may find some house sellers offering to lend you money if you agree to 
buy their home. Why? Because the sellers may believe that the loan will help 
sell their house faster and at a higher price and provide a better return on 
their investment dollars.
And therein lies the reason you should be highly cautious about seller 
financing. Generally speaking, sellers offering houses for sale with financing tend 
to be selling problematic houses with major flaws. It’s also possible that 
the property may be priced far above its fair market value. Alternatively, 
however, the sellers may be offering financing because the local real estate 
market is sluggish or because they can’t think of better ways to invest the 
proceeds of sale.
Considering/soliciting seller financing
Some house sellers who aren’t offering to provide financing may consider it; 
you won’t know until you ask.
We advocate considering seller financing under the following conditions:
 
 The property doesn’t have fatal flaws. As we explain in our Home 
Buying For Dummies book, avoid buying a house with incurable defects.
 
 You can buy the property at its fair market value or less. Seller financing 
is often offered on properties that aren’t selling. Property that’s gathering 
cobwebs is generally overpriced. Saving 1 percent on a seller-financed 
loan won’t mean much if you grossly overpay for the house.
 
 The cost of the seller-financed loan is as low as or lower than you 
can get through a traditional mortgage lender. Why borrow from 
the seller if it doesn’t save you money? Of course, if you have credit 
problems that make borrowing from traditional lenders prohibitively 
costly or impossible, you have another good reason to borrow from a 
seller.

128
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Overcoming borrower problems
You may be tempted to consider borrowing from a seller because of problems 
with your credit or financial situation. Smart house sellers will pull a copy of 
your credit report. If they discover blemishes, they won’t grant you a loan or 
will charge you a much higher interest rate. Be sure the warts on your report 
are correct. Credit reporting agencies and creditors who report information to 
the agencies have been known to make mistakes.
 
Provide a written and detailed explanation of any credit report problems at 
the time you apply to the sellers for a loan if you know that they’re going to 
pull a credit report. Another way to address a seller’s concerns is to get a 
cosigner, such as a relative, for the loan.
If your income is low, you can try to accumulate a larger down payment 
to placate the lender or get a relative with sufficient income to cosign the 
loan. You can also consider an FHA loan, or if you’re a veteran, a VA loan. In 
Chapter 2, we provide comprehensive coverage of ways to overcome these 
problems.
Negotiating loan terms
Call several local lenders to find out the rate they’re charging for the size and 
type of loan that you’re contemplating (for example, 15- or 30-year, fixed-rate 
mortgage; first or second mortgage; or owner-occupied or rental property). 
Be sure to ask about all the fees — application, appraisal, credit report, 
points, and so on.
If you’re in good financial health and can easily qualify to borrow from a 
traditional lender, you should expect better terms than the traditional 
mortgage lenders are offering you. How much better depends in large part 
upon how good at negotiating you are! Aim for at least a 1-percent reduction 
in the ongoing interest rate as well as on the upfront fees. For example, if 
traditional lenders are charging 8 percent plus two points (percent) upfront, 
aim to pay no more than 7 percent with one point.
Deciding whether to provide 
seller financing
When the time comes for you to sell your house, offering seller financing may 
broaden the pool of potential buyers for your property. Traditional mortgage 
lenders are subject to many rules and regulations that force them to deny 
some mortgage applications. However, making loans to borrowers rejected 
by banks can be risky business.

129
 Chapter 7: Finding Your Best Lender
 
To even consider making a loan against the house you are selling, all of the 
following conditions should apply to your situation:
 
 Without the cash you’re lending to the buyer, you should still be 
financially able to purchase the next home or property you desire. 
Most house sellers need the proceeds from the sale of their current 
property to be able to buy their next one.
 
 You’re willing to do the necessary work to assess the creditworthiness 
of a borrower. A smart mortgage lender would do the same before risking 
his money on a loan, so why wouldn’t you?
 
 If the borrower defaults, you’re in a financial position where you 
can afford to lose all this money. If the borrower does stop making 
monthly payments to you, you may have to initiate the costly process 
of foreclosure.
 
 You desire income-oriented investments and are in a low tax bracket. 
The interest income on a mortgage loan is taxable, so if you’re in a 
higher tax bracket and you want interest income, you’re probably better 
off investing in tax-free municipal bonds.
Only if all of these conditions apply should you consider extending a 
financing offer to a prospective buyer of your house. If you’re going to 
do that, you should then do what every smart mortgage lender would do: 
Thoroughly review a prospective borrower’s creditworthiness. In Chapters 
2 and 3, we explain how lenders do that.

 Looking at some safe surfing ideas
 Checking out mortgage sites
A
 computer is a tool. Used wisely, it may save you time and money. 
However, like other tools (such as a hammer), used incorrectly 
(remember the last time you whacked your finger with a hammer?) or for 
the wrong purpose (tapping a glass window comes to mind), a computer can 
cause more harm than good.
Some people have mistaken assumptions about using their computers to 
help them make important financial decisions. Some believe and hope that 
their computers can solve their financial problems or provide unique insights 
and vast profits. Often, such erroneous musings originate from propaganda 
put forth about the Internet.
As computers, technology, and the Internet continue to proliferate, we take 
seriously the task of explaining how, where, and when to use the Internet to 
help you make important mortgage decisions. In this chapter, we highlight 
key concepts and issues for you to understand as well as list a few of our 
favorite Web sites.
Obeying Our Safe Surfing Tips
Before we get to specific sites that are worthy of your time, in this section we 
provide an overview of how we suggest using (and not being abused by) your 
mortgage-related Web surfing. Specific sites will come and go, but these safe 
surfing tips should assist you with assessing any site that you may stumble 
upon.

132
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Shop to find out about rates and programs
The best reason that we can think of to access the Internet when you’re 
looking for a mortgage is to discover more about the going rate for the 
various types of loans you’re considering. Despite all the cautions we 
raise in this chapter, shopping for a mortgage online has some attractions:
 
 No direct sales pressure. Because you don’t speak or meet with a 
mortgage officer (who typically works on commission) when you 
peruse mortgage rates online, you can do so without much pressure. 
That said, some sites are willing to give out specific loan informa-
tion only after you reveal a fair amount of information about yourself, 
including how to get in touch with you. On one site where you must 
register to list your loan desires, for example, take a look at how the 
site pitches itself to prospective mortgage lenders: “FREE, hot leads! 
Every lead is HOT, HOT, HOT because the borrower has paid us a fee 
to post their loan request.”
 
 Shop when you like. Because most people work weekdays when lenders 
and mortgage brokers are available, squeezing in calls to lenders is often 
difficult. Thus, another advantage of mortgage Internet shopping is that 
you can do it any time of any day when it’s convenient for you.
Quality control is often insufficient
Particularly at sites where lenders simply pay a fee to be part of the program, 
you should know that quality control may be nonexistent or not up to your 
standards. “We make your loan request available to every online lender in 
the world,” boasts one online mortgage listing service. We don’t know too 
many borrowers willing to work with just any old mortgage company! Some 
sites don’t check to see whether a participating lender provides a high level 
of service or meets promises and commitments made to previous customers.
 
Again, if you’re going to go loan shopping on the Internet, examine each site 
to see how it claims to review listed lenders. One site we’re familiar with 
claims to demand strict ethics from the companies it lists — no lowballing or 
bait-and-switch tactics — and says that it has removed several dozen lenders 
from its list for such violations. That makes us think that the site should do a 
better job of screening lenders upfront!

133
 Chapter 8: Surfing the Internet’s Mortgage Sites
Beware simplistic affordability calculators
Be highly skeptical of information about the mortgage amount that you can 
afford. Most online mortgage calculators simplistically use overall income 
figures and the current loan interest rate to calculate the mortgage amount a 
borrower can “afford.” These calculators are really spitting out the maximum 
a bank will lend you based on your income. As we discuss in Chapter 1, this 
figure has nothing to do with the amount you can really afford.
Such a simplistic calculation ignores your larger financial picture: how 
much (or little) you have put away for other long-term financial goals such 
as retirement or college educations for your children. Thus, you need to 
take a hard look at your budget and goals before deciding how much you 
can afford to spend on a home; don’t let some slick Java-based calculator 
make this decision for you.
Don’t reveal confidential 
information unless . . .
Suppose that you follow all our advice in this chapter, and you find your 
best mortgage deal online. You may find yourself solicited to apply for your 
mortgage online as well. However, as you gather your confidential financial 
documents, you may have an unsettling feeling and wonder just how safe 
and wise it is to be entering this type of information into an Internet site.
 
We applaud your instincts and concerns! Here’s what you should do to 
protect yourself:
 
 Do your homework on the business. In Chapter 7, we suggest a variety 
of questions to ask and issues to clarify before deciding to do business 
with any lender — online or offline.
 
 Review the lender’s security and confidentiality policies. On reputable 
lender Web sites, you’ll be able to find the lender’s policies regarding 
how it handles the personal and financial information you may share 
with it. We recommend doing business only with sites that don’t sell 
or share your information with any outside organization other than for 
the sole purpose of verifying your creditworthiness needed for loan 
approval. Be sure to choose secure sites that prevent computer hackers 
from obtaining the information you enter.
 
If you’re simply not comfortable — for whatever reason — applying for a loan 
online, know that most online mortgage brokers and lenders offer users the 
ability to apply for their loan offline (at an office or via loan papers sent through 
the regular mail). They may charge a slightly higher fee for this service, but if it 
makes you feel more comfortable, consider it money well spent.

134
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Be sure to shop offline
You may find your best mortgage deal online. However, you won’t know 
that it’s the best unless and until you’ve done sufficient shopping offline as 
well. Why shop offline? You want to be able to see all your options and find 
the best one. Online mortgage options aren’t necessarily the cheapest or 
the best. What good is a quote for a low mortgage rate that a lender doesn’t 
deliver on or that you won’t qualify for because of your specific property, 
location, or financial situation? Remember: Personal service and honoring 
commitments is highly important.
You may be able to save a small amount of money by taking a mortgage you 
find online. Some online mortgage brokers are willing to take a somewhat 
smaller slice of commission for themselves if they feel they’re saving time 
and money processing your loan via an online application. As we discuss in 
Chapter 7, mortgage brokers’ fees do vary and are negotiable. Some online 
mortgage brokers are willing to take less than the industry standard cut (one-
plus-percent).
But just because you’ve been offered a slightly better rate online, you 
shouldn’t necessarily jump on it. Local lender or mortgage brokers may 
negotiate with you to make themselves competitive. However, you have to 
give them the opportunity to do so. Other things being equal, go back to the 
runner-up on price and give them a chance to meet or beat your best offer. 
You may be pleasantly surprised with the results.
 
Mortgage Web sites are best used to research the current marketplace 
rather than to actually apply for and secure a mortgage. The reason: 
Mortgage lending is still largely a locally-driven business that varies based 
upon nuances of a local real estate market.
Beware of paid advertising masquerading 
as directories
Some sites on the Internet offer “directories” of mortgage lenders. Most sites 
charge lenders a fee to be listed or to gain a more visible listing. And, just as 
with any business buying a yellow pages listing, higher visibility listings (ads) 
cost more. Here’s how one online directory entices lenders to advertise on 
their site:
Sure, our basic listing is free, but we have thousands of mortgage 
companies in our directory. A free listing is something like a five-second 
radio advertisement at 2:00 a.m. on an early Sunday morning. To make 
your listing really work for you, you must upgrade your listing.

135
 Chapter 8: Surfing the Internet’s Mortgage Sites
Upgrade, here, is a code word for pay for it! For example, a “gold listing” on 
this site costs $600 per year for one state and $360 for each additional state. 
What does that amount of money get you?
A Gold Listing sorts your company name to the top of all listings. In 
addition, the Gold Listings receive a higher typeface font and a Gold 
Listing icon next to their name.
On another directory site, you can find a “directory enhancement program,” 
which for $125 per year allows a lender to buy a boldface listing and for $225 
per line per year place descriptive text under the listing. Thus, prospective 
borrowers visiting these sites are looking at the mortgage equivalent of a 
Yellow Pages advertising directory rather than a comprehensive or low-cost 
lender directory.
If you’re considering using an Internet site to shop for a mortgage, first 
investigate the way the site derived the list of lenders. If the site isn’t upfront 
about disclosing this information, be suspicious. Do some sleuthing like we 
did; click on the buttons at the site that solicit lenders to join the fray. Here 
you can find out how the site attracts lenders and you may also find the 
amount lenders are paying to be listed.
Perusing Our Recommended 
Mortgage Web Sites
In addition to seeking only the highest quality sources for you, dear reader, we 
don’t want you wasting your time on a wild goose chase for some unreliable 
Web site that’s here today and gone tomorrow. In this section, we recommend 
a short list of our favorite mortgage sites. Yes, many more sites are out there, 
but we don’t want to bore you with a huge laundry list of mortgage-related 
sites. And, please remember as we discuss in Chapter 7, mortgages are 
distributed through numerous types of mortgage lenders and brokers. The 
Internet is simply another way that these players can reach prospective 
customers.
Useful government sites
Various government agencies provide assistance to low-income homebuyers 
as well as veterans. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 
Web site (see Figure 8-1) at www.hud.gov provides information on the federal 
government’s FHA loan program as well as listing HUD homes for sale 
(foreclosed homes for which the owners had FHA loans). On this site, you can 
also find links to other useful federal government housing-related Web sites.

Also, if you’re a veteran, check out the VA’s Web site (see Figure 8-2) (www.
homeloans.va.gov) operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
In addition to information on VA loans, veterans and nonveterans alike are 
eligible to buy foreclosed properties on which there was a VA loan.
The Federal Citizen Information Center (www.pueblo.gsa.gov/housing.
htm) offers numerous free and low-cost pamphlets on home financing topics 
such as securing home equity loans, avoiding loan fraud, finding mortgages 
and home improvement loans to make your home more energy efficient, and 
qualifying for a low down-payment mortgage.
Fannie Mae (www.fanniemae.com) has many resources for mortgage 
borrowers and homebuyers. In addition to helping you find mortgage 
lenders for home purchases, improvements, or refinances, the site can 
also turn you onto helpful worksheets and counseling agencies. Freddie 
Mac (www.freddiemac.com) offers similar (although not as extensive) 
resources.
Finally, if you’re trying to fix your problematic credit report, don’t waste your 
money on so-called credit-repair firms, which often overpromise — and charge 
big fees for doing things that you can do yourself. In addition to following 
our credit-fixing advice in Chapters 2 and 3, also check out the Federal Trade 
Commission’s Web site (www.ftc.gov) for helpful credit-repair advice.

Mortgage information and shopping sites
HSH Associates (www.hsh.com) is the nation’s largest collector and publisher 
of mortgage information. If you’re a data junkie, you’ll enjoy perusing the HSH 
site, which includes up-to-date mortgage rates and graphs showing recent 
trends. Unlike many other firms that collect and disseminate this type of data, 
HSH doesn’t charge fees to the lenders for being included in their reports. 
These reports are available for a $10 to $20 fee and may be ordered via the 
Web site (see Figure 8-3) or by calling HSH at 800-873-2837.
Some lenders do choose to advertise online at HSH’s Lender Showcase, and 
you can obtain their rates through the Web site’s ad links.
Many online mortgage brokers and lenders provide rate quotes and assist 
with your loan shopping. The interactive features of some sites even allow 
prospective borrowers to compare the total cost of loans (including points 
and fees) under different scenarios (how long you keep the loan and what 
happens to the interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgages). Interpreting these 
comparisons, however, requires a solid understanding of mortgage lingo and 
pricing.

E-Loan (www.eloan.com), an online mortgage broker, is a good place to 
research and compare different types of mortgage loans (see Figure 8-4). 
Interactive questionnaires and calculators can show you how, say, a given 
adjustable-rate mortgage compares with a fixed-rate loan in terms of total 
cost (including points and fees) over any specified period of time. You can 
also apply for a mortgage directly from the Web site if you so desire. If you 
do, E-Loan’s site allows you to track the loan’s process until closing.
Two other sites that we like are www.bankrate.com and www.realtor.com. 
Bank Rate’s site offers lots of information and perspectives and many types of 
consumer loans including mortgages. Realtor.com’s Home Finance section is 
more focused on mortgages. On both sites, you can shop for specific mortgages.
We also like a handful of sites with news and information on mortgages (and 
other real estate–related topics):
 
 Deadlinenews.com: Operated by veteran real estate writer Broderick 
Perkins, this site has up-to-date articles with a special emphasis on the 
California real estate market. Look for the Web site at www.deadline

 Inman.com: Brad Inman is the proprietor of Inman News, which features 
columns on many real estate topics including mortgages. Look for the 
Web site at www.inman.com.

Choosing Your Preferred 
Mortgage
In This Chapter
 Minimizing your myriad mortgage costs
 Understanding the point and interest rate tradeoff
 Recognizing loan features to avoid
 Interviewing lenders and comparing their programs
I
n Chapter 7, we explain how to develop a short list of lenders. In this 
chapter, we get down to the important and often difficult business of 
comparing various lenders’ loan programs to one another so you can choose 
the best. As we say throughout this book, best doesn’t necessarily mean 
lowest cost, especially if the lowest cost lender you uncover has lousy service 
or doesn’t deliver on the glowing promises in its marketing hype.
That said, clearly an important part of your selection process is pricing — 
namely, the amount each lender charges for a comparable loan. Mortgages 
require monthly payments to repay the debt. As we discuss in Chapter 1, 
your mortgage payment, which is comprised of interest (lender charges for 
use of the money you borrowed), and principal (repayment of the original 
amount borrowed), is likely your biggest monthly expense of homeownership 
and perhaps of your entire household budget. Over the life of your mortgage 
loan, you’ll probably pay more in total interest charges than you originally 
paid for the home itself.
For example, suppose you buy a home for $200,000. After making a 
20-percent down payment of $40,000, you get a $160,000 loan. If you borrow 
that $160,000 with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 7 percent, you end up 
paying a whopping $223,616 in interest charges over the life of your loan — 
more than the purchase price of the home! And those interest charges don’t 
include various upfront fees, which we discuss later in this chapter (see the 
section “Other lender fees”) that most mortgages carry.

142
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Taking a Look at Loan Fees
By far, the biggest expense of a mortgage is the ongoing interest charges — 
normally quoted as a percentage per year of the amount borrowed. You may 
be familiar with rates of interest if you’ve ever borrowed money through 
student loans, credit cards, or auto loans. In these cases, lenders may have 
charged you 9, 10, 12, or perhaps even 21 percent interest or more for the 
privilege of using their money. (Now you know how banks pay for their 
downtown corporate headquarters and the marble in their branch lobbies!) 
Similarly, mortgage lenders also quote you an annual interest rate on 
mortgage loans.
However, in addition to paying interest on your mortgage loan on an ongoing 
basis, most mortgages also charge upfront interest known as points or a loan 
origination fee. (This fee helps pay for the mahogany desks in the branches 
and the bank executives’ retirement pensions!) This section also zeros in on 
other lender charges such as application and processing fees as well as fees 
you may incur for a credit report and property appraisal. 
The point and interest rate tradeoff
The interest rate on a mortgage is and should always be quoted together with 
the points on the loan. The points on a mortgage used to purchase a home are 
tax deductible in the year in which you incur them, whereas on a refinance, the 
points are gradually tax deductible over the life of the refinanced mortgage loan.
Mortgage lenders and brokers quote points as a percentage of the mortgage 
amount and require you to pay them at the time that you close on your 
loan. One point is equal to 1 percent of the amount that you’re borrowing. 
For example, if lenders say a loan costs one and a half points, they mean 
that if you take the loan, you must pay the lender 1.5 percent of the loan 
amount as points. On a $150,000 loan, for example, one and a half points 
would cost you $2,250.
Because no one enjoys paying extra costs such as these, you may rightfully be 
thinking that as you shop for a mortgage, you’ll simply shun those loans that 
have high points. Don’t get suckered into believing that no-point loans are a good 
deal. You’ll find no free lunches in the real estate world. Unfortunately, if you 
shop for a low- or no-point mortgage, you’re going to get whacked other ways. 
The relationship between the interest rate on a mortgage and that same loan’s 
points can best be thought of as a seesaw; one end of the seesaw is the loan’s 
interest rate, and the other end of the seesaw represents the loan’s points.
So, if you pay less in points, the ongoing interest rate will be higher. If a 
loan has zero points, it must have a higher interest rate than a comparable 
mortgage with competitively priced points. This fact doesn’t necessarily 

143
 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
mean that the loan is better or worse than comparable loans from other 
lenders. However, in our experience, lenders that aggressively push 
no-point loans aren’t the most competitive on pricing.
 
You may be surprised to hear us say that some people may be better off 
selecting a mortgage with higher points. If you pay higher points on a mortgage, 
the lender should lower the ongoing interest rate. This reduction may be benefi-
cial to you if you have the cash to pay more points and want to lower the interest 
rate that you’ll be paying month after month and year after year. If you expect 
to hold onto the home and mortgage for many years, the lower the interest rate, 
the better.
Conversely, if you want to (or need to) pay fewer points (perhaps because 
you’re cash constrained when you take out your loan), you can elect to pay 
a higher ongoing interest rate. The shorter the time that you expect to hold 
onto the mortgage, the more this strategy of paying less now (in points) and 
more later (in ongoing interest) makes sense.
Take a look at a couple of specific mortgage options to understand the points/
interest-rate tradeoff. For example, suppose you want to borrow $150,000. 
One lender quotes you 7.25 percent on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and charges 
one point (1 percent). Another lender quotes 7.75 percent (a difference of 0.5 
percent) and doesn’t charge any points. Which loan is better? The answer 
depends mostly on how long you plan to keep the loan.
The 7.25-percent loan costs $1,024 per month compared to $1,075 per 
month for the 7.75-percent mortgage. You can save $51 per month with the 
7.25-percent loan, but you’d have to pay $1,500 in points to get it.
 
To find out which loan is better for you, divide the cost of the points by the 
monthly savings ($1,500 ÷ $51 = 29.4). This result gives you the number of 
months (in this case, 29) that it will take you to recover the cost of the points. 
Thus, if you expect to keep the loan for less than 30 months (2.5 years), 
choose the no-points loan. If you plan to keep the loan more than 30 months, 
pay the points. If you keep the loan for the remaining 27.5 years needed to 
repay it, you’ll save $16,830 ($51 a month for 330 months).
 
In order for you to make a fair comparison of mortgages from different 
lenders, have the lenders provide interest rate quotes in writing for loans 
with the same number of points. For example, ask the mortgage contenders 
to tell you what their fixed-rate mortgage interest rate would be at one 
point. Also, make sure that the loans are for the same term — for example, 
30 years.

144
Part III: Landing a Lender 
Annual percentage rates
Truth-in-lending law requires lenders to calculate a loan’s Annual Percentage 
Rate (APR) when quoting interest rates. In theory, this calculation gives 
prospective borrowers a way to figure out whether a 30-year fixed-rate loan 
at 7-percent interest and 1 point is a better deal than a 6.75-percent mortgage 
and 2 points.
APR is a figure that states the total annual cost of a mortgage expressed by 
the actual rate of interest paid over the full term of the loan. In addition to 
the loan’s stated interest rate, the APR also includes prepaid finance charges 
such as its loan origination fee and other add-on loan fees and costs. As a 
result, a mortgage’s APR will always be higher than the interest rate quoted 
by a lender. The only exception is a no-points, no-fees mortgage, in which 
case the APR will equal the loan’s quoted interest rate.
 
APR doesn’t solve all your problems with understanding mortgage rates. 
For one thing, folks usually don’t keep their fixed-rate loans for the full 15- or 
30-year term. As a result, their mortgage’s actual APR will be higher than the 
quoted APR because its points and loan fees are spread out over fewer years. 
Calculating the APR of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that may or may not 
adjust monthly, semi-annually, or annually based on movement of an index 
that’s impossible to determine when you get the loan is an exercise in futility.
Our advice is simple: When comparing loans from various lenders, make sure 
the lenders provide interest rate quotes for loans with the identical points 
and loan terms. The next section explains a few other common prepaid 
financing charges.
Other lender fees
 
After swallowing the fact that you’re paying points on your mortgage, you may 
think that no other upfront fees will come your way. Unfortunately, you’ll find 
no shortage of upfront loan-processing charges to investigate when you make 
mortgage comparisons. Understanding all of a lender’s fees is vital; these 
fees come out of your pocket. If you don’t understand the fees, you may end 
up with an unnecessarily high-cost loan or come up short of cash when the 
time comes to close on your loan. If you’re taking out a new mortgage loan 
to finance a home purchase, not being able to close could put the kibosh on 
buying your dream home.
Be sure to ask each lender whose loans you’re seriously considering for a 
written itemization of all upfront financing charges:

145
 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
 
 Application and processing fees: Lenders generally charge several 
hundred dollars as an application or processing fee. This charge is mainly 
intended to ensure that you’re serious about obtaining a loan from them 
and to compensate them in the event that your loan is rejected (either on 
their end or yours). Lenders want to cover their costs to keep from losing 
money on loan applications that don’t materialize into actual loans. A few 
lenders don’t charge this fee; or if they do, they return it when you close 
on the loan.
 
 Credit report: Your credit report tells a lender how well you manage 
your finances. Expect to pay $25 to $35 or so (protest significantly higher 
amounts) for the lender to obtain a current copy of yours. If you know 
that you have blemishes such as late credit card payments on your 
report, address those problems before you apply for your mortgage. 
Otherwise, you’re wasting your time and money by applying for a loan 
that you’ll be denied. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report 
from any lender who recently turned you down for a loan because of 
derogatory information on your credit file. The lender is legally required 
to give you a copy of the report. The credit report provider can provide 
the report as well. If you need to clean up problems on your credit report, 
see our detailed discourse on the subject in Chapter 2.
 
 Appraisal: Mortgage lenders require an independent assessment from 
an appraiser, to determine whether the property that you want to buy 
is worth the amount you agreed to pay for it. If you’re refinancing, 
an appraisal is required to ensure that the home is worth more than 
enough to justify the amount of mortgage money you seek to borrow. 
The cost of an appraisal varies with the size, complexity, and value of 
property. Expect to pay a few hundred dollars for the appraisal of a 
modestly priced, average-type property. You’ll probably have to pay 
this fee prior to the appraisal.
 
 Lenders generally require an appraisal because if you overpay for your 
property and home values decline or you end up in financial trouble, 
you may be willing to walk away from the property and leave the lender 
holding the bag. That’s how many foreclosures happened in the late 
2000s’ real-estate market downturn.
 
To reduce your chances of throwing away money on a mortgage for which you 
may not qualify, ask the lender whether your application may be turned down 
for some reason. For example, disclose any potential problems — of which 
you are aware — on your credit report.
 
Watch out for junk fees — financing charges that go into the lender’s pocket 
rather than to title companies, appraisers, and other legitimate third parties. 
For more on these pernicious charges, see Chapter 1.
Also, be aware as you shop for mortgages from lender to lender that just 
as some lenders have no-point mortgages, some lenders also have no-fee 
mortgages. If a lender is pitching a no-fee loan, odds are that the lender will 
charge you more in the ongoing interest rate on your loan.

146
Part III: Landing a Lender 
So that you don’t spend any more than you need to on your mortgage and so 
that you get the mortgage that best meets your needs, the time has come to 
get on with the task of understanding the available mortgage options.
Avoiding Dangerous Loan Features
Just as with any product or service you may buy, some mortgages come 
with “features” we think you should avoid. Just as you shouldn’t buy a flimsy 
umbrella that will break in the first wind and rainstorm or a car model with 
known, problematic defects, what follows are loan bells and whistles you 
should bypass.
Prepayment penalties
 
As we discuss in Chapter 4, a prepayment penalty is a mortgage provision 
that penalizes you for paying off the loan balance faster than is required by 
the loan’s payment schedule. Note that some lenders won’t enforce the loan’s 
prepayment penalties when you pay off a mortgage early because you sold 
an owner-occupied, one- to four-unit property. Beware of mortgages with so-
called hard prepayment penalties that must be paid without any exceptions.
Prepayment penalties can amount to as much as several percentage points 
of the amount of the mortgage balance that you pay off early. Although 
some states place limits on prepayment penalties mortgage lenders may 
levy on owner-occupied residential property, the charges may still be stiff. 
For example, on a $150,000 mortgage balance with a 4-percent prepayment 
penalty, you’ll get socked with a $6,000 surcharge for paying your loan off. 
A $300,000 mortgage with a similar prepayment penalty would sock you 
$12,000. (Of course, you may be thinking that you should have such prob-
lems as to have such piles of extra cash sitting around in your investment 
accounts!)
So how do you discover whether a given mortgage loan comes with a 
prepayment penalty? As you’re shopping for a mortgage, be sure to ask 
each lender whether the loan has a prepayment penalty. Also, know that 
many of the no-point or no-fee mortgages we discuss earlier in this chapter 
have prepayment penalties. In addition to asking about possible prepayment 
penalties as you shop for a mortgage, when you think you’ve settled 
on a loan, carefully review the federal truth-in-lending disclosure and the 
promissory note (actual loan agreement) to look for any mentions of 
prepayment penalties and under what conditions such penalties apply.

 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
Negative amortization
 
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe 
is amortized (gradually reduced). The reverse of this process — increasing 
the size of your mortgage balance — is called negative amortization. Negative 
amortization pops up more often on mortgages that lenders consider risky to 
make. If you’re having trouble finding lenders willing to offer you a mortgage, 
be especially careful.
Negative amortization is what happens, for example, when you pay only the 
minimum payment required on a credit card bill. You continue accumulating 
additional interest on the balance as long as you make only the minimum 
monthly payment. However, as we discuss in Chapter 1, allowing negative 
amortization to occur with a mortgage defeats the purpose of your borrowing 
an amount that fits your overall financial goals.
As we discuss in Chapter 5, some adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) cap the 
increase of your monthly payment but not the increase of the interest rate. 
Thus, the size of your mortgage payment may not reflect the interest actually 
due for that payment. So, rather than paying the interest that’s owed and 
paying off some of your loan balance every month, you may end up paying 
only a portion of the interest you owe; the extra interest you owe is added to, 
and thus increases, your outstanding debt.
 
Some lenders (and mortgage brokers) aren’t forthcoming about the fact that 
an ARM they’re pitching you has negative amortization. So how can you avoid 
negative-amortization loans? Start by asking lenders while you’re shopping. Also, 
as with uncovering prepayment penalties, when you’re getting serious about a 
loan, review the federal truth-in-lending disclosure and the promissory note the 
mortgage lender provides you. Be sure to do this well ahead of the loan’s funding 
date so you have time to negotiate loan charges and fees before it’s too late.
Comparing Lenders’ Programs
Whether you’re in the market to buy a home or you’re seeking to refinance an 
existing mortgage, you need to get serious about securing a mortgage and initi-
ate the shopping process. (As we discuss in Chapter 2, we believe that you’ll 
strengthen your negotiating position with a property seller by taking the time 
to get preapproved for a mortgage before submitting an offer to buy a home.)
Whether you do the mortgage shopping yourself or hire a competent mortgage 
broker to assist (see Chapter 7 for more details about how to make this 
important decision), compare a variety of programs to help you assess which 
is best for you. Lots of facts and figures will be thrown at you, and we’ve 
found that some simple worksheets can help you keep the details straight 
and more easily compare various loans.

Part III: Landing a Lender 
Fixed-rate mortgages interview worksheet
In Chapter 5, we walk you through the critical issues to consider when deciding 
between a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) versus an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). 
So if you haven’t reviewed that chapter, now is a fine time to do so.
If the security and peace of mind that come with a fixed-rate mortgage appeal 
to you, you may also be happy to know that shopping for a fixed-rate loan is 
simpler than shopping for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Simpler, unfortunately, 
doesn’t translate into easier.
Table 9-1 can help you keep the details of various lenders’ programs clear 
and make easier comparisons. Taking good notes also ensures that you’ll 
have documented what you were told if any discrepancies crop up in the 
future. Here’s a brief description of the elements you need to understand to 
complete the worksheet in Table 9-1:
 
 Contact information: Take the time to jot down the phone number that 
you call, because you may need to call it again in the future, especially if 
it’s for a loan that you’re likely to take. Also, some lending institutions are 
huge. You may end up having your call transferred several times before 
reaching the final destination. Be sure to ask the person you ultimately 
interview for her direct phone number, fax number, and e-mail address.
 
 Person interviewed: Your relationship with a lender should be with a 
specific person, usually the loan officer. This is the person to call if you 
have more questions, to check the progress on your loan, to complain if 
things aren’t moving the way you expected, or to offer thanks when you 
do get what you were promised or get good service.
 
 Loan processor: The loan processor handles your loan’s paperwork 
from the time you submit the loan application until your loan is closed. 
The loan processor’s job includes everything from conducting the credit 
investigation to preparing loan documents you’ll sign prior to funding 
the mortgage. If possible, get the loan processor’s direct phone number, 
fax number, and e-mail address.
 
 Date interviewed: If discrepancies arise, your notation of dates could 
prove important.
 
 Program name: Most mortgage lenders give catchy and sometimes 
goofy names to various loan types. This jargon helps identify loans.
 
 Interest rate: What is the annual interest rate the lender is quoting?
 
 Points: As we discuss earlier in this chapter (see the section “The point 
and interest rate tradeoff”), an interest rate quote without a quote of 
points is meaningless. Get the quote for points as well.

149
 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
 
 Fees: Although no-fee loans exist, they’re the exception. Therefore, as 
we highlight earlier in this chapter (see the section “Other lender fees”), 
ask the lender to detail any and all fees: application, processing, credit 
report, appraisal, and others.
 
 Required down payment: For most loans, you’ll be asked for a 10- or 
20-percent down payment. So be sure to ask how much down payment 
is required for the loan terms the lending officer is quoting. Generally 
speaking, the smaller the required down payment percentage, the higher 
the interest rate and/or points you’ll pay.
 
 As we discuss in Chapter 4, try to make at least a 20-percent cash down 
payment to avoid being nailed with private mortgage insurance (PMI). 
The 80-10-10 financing technique we describe in Chapter 6 is another 
way to eliminate the need for PMI. (Most lenders, rather than thinking 
in terms of percentage down payments, think instead in terms of loan-
to-value ratios — that is, the loan amount divided by the value of the 
property. For example, a lender may say that it allows an 80-percent 
loan-to-value ratio: That’s the same as saying that it requires a down 
payment of 20 percent of the value of the property.)
 
 Loan amount allowed: All loan programs limit the size of the loans (the 
amount of money you borrow) that the terms and conditions apply to. 
What good is a low interest rate and point quotation if it applies only to 
loan amounts smaller than you’re seeking? Ask what size loans the terms 
apply to.
 
 Term (number of years): Over how many years will the loan be repaid? 
Typically, a loan is for 30 years, but some are repaid over 15 years. 
Under unusual circumstances, other lengths of time may apply. If you 
need assistance deciding which mortgage period makes the best sense 
for you, be sure to see Chapter 5.
 
 Prepayment penalties: We strongly recommend avoiding loans with 
prepayment penalties. Tell lenders upfront that you don’t want to 
consider loans with these costs. When you discuss individual loan 
programs, be sure to confirm that the mortgage under consideration 
doesn’t include prepayment penalties.
 
 Assumability: This feature allows you to pass on the remaining balance 
of your mortgage to a creditworthy buyer of your house. Fixed-rate loans 
generally aren’t assumable, because lenders got burned in prior decades 
when interest rates shot up and relatively low-rate, fixed mortgages were 
passed from house sellers to homebuyers.
 
 Estimated monthly payment: How much are you going to pay each 
month for your mortgage? Ask so that you’ll have this vital information 
when you review your expected monthly housing costs (see Chapter 1).
 
 Other issues discussed: Make note of any other issues of importance 
you discussed with the lender. Again, your notes may come in handy if 
any discrepancies arise down the road.

 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
Adjustable-rate mortgages 
interview worksheet
In Chapter 5, we discuss the major features and differences among the various 
adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). We also compare ARMs to fixed-rate loans. 
If you haven’t perused that chapter yet, please do so now.
Few financial products or services are as difficult to shop for as an ARM. 
We’re not trying to scare you but simply prepare you for the reality of the 
sometimes-complex issues that confront ARM shoppers.
Table 9-2 is designed to make shopping for an ARM easier on you. Taking 
good notes of the details of ARMs you’re shopping for serves two purposes. 
First, you’ll discover more information. Second, your notes will help you 
hold lenders accountable for their statements and promises. Here’s a brief 
description of the elements in Table 9-2:
A closer look: Rate lock terms
Most lenders will agree to hold firm on interest 
rates and other terms they quote to you (usually 
for a 30-day period). For a nominal fee or slight 
interest rate increase, lenders will typically 
commit to hold rates and other terms firm for a 
45- to 60-day period. The obvious benefit to you 
is that this commitment or rate lock as it’s often 
called, provides you peace of mind and one 
less surprise down the road if mortgage rates 
suddenly skyrocket before your loan is funded.
Paying a fee for a rate lock is analogous to 
buying insurance. You pay a premium to transfer 
the risk of something bad happening (for example, 
interest rates increasing) onto the lenders, who 
can hedge their risk by using various financial 
transactions.
So is ”buying” rate lock insurance worth the 
cost when you secure a mortgage? Consider 
that on most mortgages, a 60-day rate lock — 
a length of time we highly recommend — will 
likely end up costing you about one-eighth to 
one-fourth additional points. On a $200,000 
mortgage, that works out to $250 to $500.
Now, that amount is nothing to disregard — 
after all, that kind of money could treat you to 
some good dinners at your favorite restaurant. 
However, compare that cost to the extra 
expense of having to pay a 0.5-percent higher 
ongoing interest rate over the life of a 30-year, 
$200,000 loan if you don’t lock in your rate and 
rates jump up. If interest rates are at 7 percent 
and then rise to 7.5 percent, you’d end up paying 
approximately $24,480 more over the life of the 
loan.
No one we know can accurately predict where 
interest rates are heading over the next month 
or two. That’s why if you don’t want the stress 
on yourself and your budget, better to lock 
in your rate when you know which loan and 
lender you’re going to choose. Also, be sure to 
get a lender’s rate lock terms in writing. Verbal 
assurances should be viewed as worthless.

 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
 
 Contact information: Make note of the lender’s phone number, because 
you may need to call it again in the future, especially if it’s for a loan 
you’re likely to take. Also, some lenders are large, and you may end up 
having your call transferred before reaching the final destination. Be 
sure to ask the person you interview for her direct line, fax number, and 
e-mail address.
 
 Person interviewed: Your relationship with a lender should be with a 
specific person, usually the loan officer. This is the person to call if you 
have more questions, to check the progress on your loan, to complain if 
things aren’t moving the way you expected or would like, and to thank 
when you do get what you were promised.
 
 Loan processor: The loan processor handles your loan’s paperwork 
from the time you submit your loan application until your loan is closed. 
The loan processor’s job includes everything from conducting the credit 
investigation to preparing loan documents you’ll sign prior to funding 
the mortgage. If possible, get the loan processor’s direct phone number, 
fax number, and e-mail address.
 
 Date interviewed: If discrepancies arise, your notation of dates could 
prove important.
 
 Program name: Most mortgage lenders give catchy and sometimes 
goofy names to various loan types. This jargon helps identify loans.
 
 Starting interest rate: ARMs typically start at a relatively low interest 
rate compared with current fixed-rate loans. So, as we note in Chapter 5, 
don’t get seduced by a low-starting, so-called teaser interest rate.
 
 Index used for future rate determination: As we discuss in Chapter 5, 
an ARM is tied to a particular index, such as the interest rate on treasury 
bills or certificates of deposit. Knowing and understanding the particular 
index a lender uses is critical, because some indexes move more rapidly 
than others.
 
 Margin: The margin is the percentage that a lender adds to the index to 
determine your ARM’s future interest rate. So be sure to ask what the 
margins are on the ARMs you’re considering. See Chapter 5 for more 
details on margins.
 
 Periodic interest rate adjustment cap: Most ARMs adjust every 6 or 
12 months. A good ARM, as we discuss in Chapter 5, limits or caps the 
amount of the increase (typically to 2 percent per year). In addition to 
finding out what the adjustment cap is, also inquire about the amount 
your payment could increase.
 
 Lifetime interest rate adjustment cap: A good ARM also caps the 
maximum interest rate allowed over the life of the loan — typically 5 
to 6 percent over the loan’s starting rate. In addition to understanding 
the highest interest rate allowed on your mortgage, also ask what the 
payment would then be.

154
Part III: Landing a Lender 
 
 Negative amortization: As we discuss earlier in this chapter (see the 
section “Negative amortization”), this situation occurs when your ARM’s 
monthly loan payment doesn’t cover all the interest you owe on the 
loan. As a result, the loan balance gets bigger each month, which can be 
financially disastrous for you. We rigorously recommend avoiding loans 
with this toxic feature.
 
 Points: As discussed earlier in this chapter (see the section “The point 
and interest rate tradeoff”), an interest rate quote without a quote of 
points is meaningless. Get the quote for points as well.
 
 Fees: Although no-fee loans exist, they’re the exception. Therefore, as 
we highlight earlier in this chapter (see the section “Other lender fees”), 
ask the lender to detail any and all fees: application, processing, credit 
report, appraisal, and others.
 
 Required down payment: On most loans, you’ll be asked for a 10- or 
20-percent down payment. So be sure to ask how much down payment 
is required for the loan terms the lending officer is quoting. Generally 
speaking, the smaller the required down-payment percentage, the higher 
the interest rate and/or points you’ll pay. As we discuss in Chapter 4, try 
to make at least a 20-percent down payment.
 
 Loan amount allowed: All loan programs limit what size loans the terms 
and conditions apply to. What good is a competitive interest rate and 
point quotation if it applies only to loan amounts smaller than what 
you’re seeking? Always ask what size loans the terms apply to.
 
 Term (number of years): Over how many years will the loan be repaid? 
The typical term is 30 years, but some loans are repaid over 15 years; 
and under unusual circumstances, other lengths of time may apply. If 
you need assistance thinking through what length mortgage makes the 
most sense for you, be sure to see Chapter 5.
 
 Prepayment penalties: As discussed earlier in this chapter, we implore 
you to avoid loans with prepayment penalties. Tell lenders upfront that 
you don’t wish to consider loans with such costs, and when discussing 
individual loan programs, be sure to confirm that the mortgage(s) under 
discussion don’t include prepayment penalties.
 
 Assumability: This feature allows you to pass on the remaining balance of 
your mortgage to a creditworthy buyer of your house if you both desire. 
Most adjustable-rate loans are assumable. However, because your house 
will likely have appreciated in value by the time you’re ready to sell, under 
normal financial conditions future buyers of your property will probably 
be able to obtain their own financing under better terms than they’d get by 
assuming your loan. Thus, we don’t think that this is a feature you should 
go out of your way to find as you shop for an ARM. If a loan is assumable, 
you may care to ask how the terms of the loan may change and whether 
there’s a limit on the number of times the loan may be assumed.

155
 Chapter 9: Choosing Your Preferred Mortgage
 
 Rate lock terms: You can lock in the rate on an ARM. Please see our 
sidebar discussion of rate locks in the section under shopping for a 
fixed-rate loan.
 
 Estimated monthly payment: With an ARM, you should inquire both 
how much you’re going to pay each month initially and after your 
rate adjusts fully to the index rate for your mortgage. You’ll want this 
important payment information as you review your expected monthly 
housing costs (see Chapter 1).
 
 Other issues discussed: Make note of any other issues of importance 
you discussed with the lender. Again, your notes may come in handy if 
any discrepancies arise down the road.
Applying with One or More Lenders
If you do your homework and pick a good lender with a reputation for low 
rates, quality service, and honesty, applying for one mortgage should be fine.
However, you may be tempted to apply with more than one mortgage lender 
(or broker). That way, if your first-choice lender doesn’t deliver, you have a 
backup. Because of the additional time and money involved in applying for 
more than one mortgage, we recommend that you consider doing so only 
under the following circumstances:
 
 You have credit problems. Applying to more than one mortgage lender 
may make sense if you know you have credit problems that may lead to 
having your loan application denied. Read Chapters 1 and 2 to whip your 
finances and credit record into shape before you embark on the home-
buying journey.
 
 You’re buying a physically or legally “difficult” property. It’s impossible, 
of course, to know in advance all the types of property idiosyncrasies that 
will upset a particular lender. If you’re buying a home for which you need a 
mortgage, reduce your chances for unpleasant surprises by asking your 
real estate agent and property inspector whether any aspects of the 
property may give a lender cause for concern. If you’re refinancing an 
existing home, you should know by now whether aspects of your 
property make getting a mortgage challenging.
 
If you end up applying for loans with two different lenders, we recommend 
that you tell both lenders that you’re applying elsewhere and why. If you 
don’t, when the second lender pulls your credit report, the first lender’s 
recent inquiry will show up. Don’t be surprised if you have to pay for two 
appraisals and two sets of credit reports. Lenders generally require their own 
documentation.

 Complying with paperwork requests
 Filling out the Uniform Residential Loan Application
 Understanding other documents in the process
I
n this chapter, we review the forms you’re commonly asked to complete in 
the mortgage-application process. If you’re working with a skilled person at 
the mortgage lending or brokerage company, that person can help you navigate 
and beat into submission most of this dreaded paperwork.
But we know you probably have some questions about what kinds of informa-
tion you’re required to provide versus information you don’t have to provide. 
You also may be uncomfortable revealing less-than-flattering facts about your 
situation; facts you feel may jeopardize your qualifications for a mortgage. 
And finally, no matter how good the mortgage person you’re working with is, 
the burden is still on you to pull together many facts, figures, and documents. 
So here we are, right by your side to coach you.
Pounding the Paperwork
In order for a mortgage lender to make a proper assessment of your current 
financial situation, the lender needs details. Thus, mortgage lenders or brokers 
ask you to sign a form authorizing and permitting them to make inquiries of your 
employer, the financial institutions that you do business with, and so on.
Mortgage lenders provide you with an incredibly lengthy list of documents 
that they require with mortgage applications, including the following:
 
 Pay stubs, typically for the most recent 30 consecutive days
 
 Two most recent years’ W-2 forms
 
 Two most recent years’ federal income tax returns

158
Par t III: Landing a Lender
 
 Signed IRS Form 4506-T Request for Transcript of Tax Return
 
 Year-to-date profit-and-loss statement and current balance sheet if 
you’re self-employed
 
 Copies of past two months’ bank, money market, and investment 
account statements
 
 Recent statements for all outstanding mortgages
 
 Copy of declarations pages for homeowners insurance policies in force
 
 Home purchase contract (if you’re financing to buy a home)
 
 Rental agreements for all rental properties
 
 Divorce decrees
 
 Federal corporate tax returns for the past two years
 
 Partnership federal tax returns for the past two years
 
 Partnership K-1s for the last two years
 
 Condo or homeowners association documentation — such as CC&Rs, 
(covenants, conditions, and restrictions) budget, bylaws, articles of 
incorporation, contact name, address, and phone number
 
 Title report, abstract, and survey
 
 Property inspection report and pest control inspection report (if you’re 
buying a home)
 
 Receipts for deposits (if you’re buying a home)
Don’t despair at the length of the list. This list must cover all possible situations, 
so some of the items won’t apply to you.
Still, you may rightfully ask, “Why do lenders require so much information?”
Most of the items on this laundry list are required to prove and substanti-
ate your current financial status to the mortgage lender and, subsequently, 
to other organizations that may buy your loan in the future. Pay stubs, tax 
returns, and bank- and investment-account statements help to document 
your income and assets. Lenders assess the risk of lending you money and 
determine how much they can lend you based on these items.
If you’re wondering why lenders can’t take your word about the personal and 
confidential financial facts and figures, remember that some people don’t tell 
the truth. Lenders have no way of knowing who is honest and who isn’t. The 
unfortunate reality is that lenders have to assume that all their loan applicants 
may lie given the opportunity.

159
 Chapter 10: Managing Mortgage Paperwork
Even though lenders require all this myriad documentation, some buyers 
still falsify information. And some mortgage brokers, in their quest to close 
more loans and earn more commissions, even coach buyers to lie to qualify 
for a loan. One example of the way people cheat: Some self-employed people 
create bogus tax returns with inflated incomes. Although a few people have 
gotten away with such deception, we don’t recommend this wayward path.
If you can’t qualify for a mortgage without resorting to trickery, getting turned 
down is for your own good. Lenders have criteria to ensure that you’ll be able 
to repay the money you borrow and that you don’t get in over your head.
 
Falsifying loan documents is committing perjury — and fraud is not in your 
best interests, even if you won’t get impeached for it. Mortgage lenders can 
catch you in your lies. How? Well, some mortgage lenders have you sign IRS 
Form 4506-T — typically at the time you submit your loan application — that 
allows them to request directly from the IRS copies of the actual tax returns 
that you filed with the IRS.
Besides the obvious legal objections, lying on your mortgage application can 
lead to your having more mortgage debt than you can really afford. If you’re short 
on a down payment, for example, alternatives are available (see Chapter 2). 
If the down payment isn’t a problem but you lack the income to qualify for 
the loan, check out loans known as NIVs (no income verification) or stated 
income loans that don’t require documentation of income. Also, refer to 
Chapter 2 for other ideas on overcoming low income or credit problems.
Filling Out the Uniform Residential
Loan Application
U.S. mortgage lenders and brokers use the Uniform Residential Loan Application 
to collect needed data about home purchases and proposed loans. Many lend-
ers use this standardized document, known in the mortgage trade as Form 1003, 
because they sell their mortgages to investors. When mortgage loans are resold, 
governmental organizations called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agree (if the 
mortgage loans meet federal standards) to guarantee the repayment of principal 
and interest, which makes it easier for lenders to sell the loans and more desir-
able for investors to buy them.
Some mortgage lenders may expect you to complete this form on your own. 
Other lenders and brokers help you fill out the form or even go so far as to 
complete it for you.

160
Par t III: Landing a Lender
If you let someone fill out the Uniform Residential Loan Application for you, 
be sure the information on the form is accurate and truthful. Ultimately, 
you’re responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of your application. Also 
be aware that, in their sales efforts, some mortgage lenders and brokers may 
invite you to their offices or invite themselves to your home or office to com-
plete this form for you or with you. Although we have no problem with good 
service, we do want you to keep in mind that you’re not beholden or obli-
gated to any lenders or brokers. It’s your money and your home purchase, 
so — as we discuss in Chapter 7 — be sure to shop around for a good loan 
officer or mortgage broker.
In the following sections, we explain the major elements on the Uniform 
Residential Loan Application.
I. Type of mortgage and terms of loan
The major items in the first section of the application (see Figure 10-1) are 
the loan amount (Amount), Interest Rate, No. of Months (length of the loan), 
and Fixed Rate or ARM (the loan type). If, at the time you’re applying for your 
mortgage, you’re unsure as to some of these options and which loan you’re 
going to select, leave the relevant spaces blank.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Section I 
opens the 
action.
 
Your mortgage lender or broker will complete the Agency Case Number and 
Lender Case Number boxes in this section.
II. Property information 
and purpose of loan
Mortgage lenders and the investors who ultimately buy these types of mortgages 
want to know why you want to borrow money. In this section (see Figure 10-2), 
provide the address and the legal description of the property. The Legal 
Description simply means the block and lot number of the property, which you 
can find on the preliminary title report. Your real estate agent, your mortgage 
lender, and you should each have copies of this report soon after you have a 
signed purchase agreement if you’re buying a property. For a refinance, your 
mortgage lender can access this information.

161
 Chapter 10: Managing Mortgage Paperwork
 
Figure 10-2: 
Section 
II asks, 
“What’s 
up?”
 
The information you include in the Purpose of Loan section indicates to 
the lender whether you plan to use the mortgage to buy a home, refinance 
an existing loan, or construct a new home. The lender also wants to know 
whether the property is your primary or secondary residence or is an invest-
ment property. Your answers to these questions determine which loans your 
property is eligible for and the terms of the loans. From a lender’s perspec-
tive, construction loans and investment-property loans are riskier and there-
fore cost you more than other loans.
 
You may be tempted (and some mortgage brokers and lender representatives 
have also been tempted) to lie on this part of the mortgage application to obtain 
more favorable loan terms. Be aware that lenders can — and sometimes do — 
challenge you to prove that you’re going to live in the property if they suspect 
otherwise. Even after closing on a purchase and their loan, lenders have been 
known to ask for proof — such as a copy of a utility bill in your name — that 
you’re living in the property. Some lenders have even been known to send a 
representative around to knock on the borrower’s door to see who’s living in 
the property.
If you’re applying for a construction or refinance loan, you need to provide 
additional information. As you can see on the form, the lender wants to know 
when you acquired the lot or property, the amount paid (Original Cost), and 
other information that helps the lender to ascertain the riskiness of lending 
you money.
When you apply for your mortgage, you must declare the way you’ll hold title 
to the property — in other words, the way the ownership of the home will be 
structured for legal purposes, such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common, and 
so forth.
To ensure that the money for your down payment and closing costs isn’t 
coming from another loan that may ultimately overburden your ability to 
repay the money they’re lending you, mortgage lenders want to know the 

162
Par t III: Landing a Lender
source of funds for your down payment and closing costs. Ideally, lenders 
want to see the down payment and closing costs coming from your personal 
savings. Tell the truth — lenders have many ways to trip you up in your lies 
here. For example, they ask to see the last several months of your bank or 
investment account statements to verify, for example, that someone else, 
such as a benevolent relative, didn’t give you the money last week.
 
If you’re receiving money from a relative as a gift to be used toward the down 
payment, have the gift giver write a short note (your broker/lender can pro-
vide a standardized gift letter) confirming that the money is indeed a present 
that you do not have to repay. Lenders are often suspicious that such pay-
ments are loans that must be repaid and that will add to your debt burden and 
risk of default.
III. Borrower information
This section of the loan application (see Figure 10-3) is where you begin to 
provide personal information about yourself as well as any co-borrower you 
are buying or currently own the property with.
Yrs. School simply means how many total years of schooling you’ve had since 
you were but a young lass or lad. If you graduated from high school, you’ve 
had 12 years of schooling. Did you go to kindergarten? Add a year. Two- or 
four-year colleges add that many years on top of the 12 or 13. If you went 
on to graduate school, add the number of years you spent at that endeavor. 
Don’t worry. Lenders won’t turn you down if you don’t have a graduate 
degree or didn’t attend college.
 
Figure 10-3: 
Section 
III gets up 
close and

163
 Chapter 10: Managing Mortgage Paperwork
The lender also wants to know where you’ve been living recently. If you’ve 
been in your most recent housing situation for at least two years, you need 
not list your two prior residences. Lenders are primarily looking for stability 
here. Most lenders also request a letter from your landlord to verify that you’ve 
paid your rent in a timely fashion. If you’ve moved frequently in recent years, 
most lenders check with previous landlords. If your application is on the border-
line, good references can tip the scales in your favor. If you’ve paid the amount 
you owed on time, you should be fine. If you haven’t, you should explain your-
self, either by separate letter to the lender or in the blank space on page four of 
the application.
IV. Employment information
Your recent work history is important to a mortgage lender. Unless you’re 
financially independent (wealthy) already, your lender knows that your 
employment income determines your ability to meet your monthly housing 
costs. As with your prior housing situation, lenders are seeking borrowers 
with stability, which can help push a marginal application through the loan-
approval channels.
Figure 10-4 illustrates the employment information section of the application.
If you’ve held your recent job for at least the past two years, that’s the only 
position you need to list (unless you currently work more than one job, in 
which case you should list all current jobs separately). Otherwise, you must 
list your prior employment to cover the past two-year period.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Section IV 
wants your 
work 
history.
 

164
Par t III: Landing a Lender
We know that, in this ever-changing economy, some people change jobs fairly 
frequently and not always out of personal choice. Perhaps you held a posi-
tion for only a few months (or less) and feel it would make your situation look 
more attractive to simply leave the position off your loan application. Others, 
who have had gaps in their employment, either because they took advantage 
of changing jobs to engage in other activities or because it took some time to 
find a suitable new position, may be tempted to discreetly gloss over gaps in 
employment.
 
What do we advise? Well, our overall perspective is that a mortgage application 
is somewhat like a resume. You should absolutely present your information in a 
positive and truthful way. It’s better to show the employment gap than to have 
the lenders uncover it, which they can do because they often ask for the dates of 
your employment when verifying information with your employers.
As for leaving off a short-term or part-time job, the choice is up to you. This 
section of the application doesn’t state that you must list every position.
Remember that lenders don’t mind some job-hopping. If they see frequent 
job changes, then the prospects for continued employment section of the 
verification-of-employment request that your current employer receives from 
the lender will be more important.
This section of the application also asks that you list the monthly income 
from prior jobs. You don’t provide your monthly income from your current 
job here because it’s provided in the next section of the application.
You may also wonder (and be concerned about) why the lender wants your 
current and previous employers’ phone numbers. Shortly before your loan 
is ready to close, the lender may call your current employer to verify that 
you’re still employed, but verification of employment is usually done through 
current pay stubs and W-2s.
It’s highly unlikely that lenders will call your previous employers unless they 
need to verify an outstanding question about employment dates or similar 
information.
V. Monthly income and housing 
expense projections
Section V (see Figure 10-5) determines the fate of most mortgage applications. 
Here, you list your monthly income, including that amount derived from invest-
ments such as bank, brokerage, and mutual fund accounts as well as any bonus 
or commissions. Most people’s employment is the element that qualifies them 
to borrow money via a mortgage. If your income fluctuates from month to 

165
 Chapter 10: Managing Mortgage Paperwork
month, simply enter your average monthly income over the past 12 months. 
(Some lenders use a 24-month average if you’re self-employed.)
 
Figure 10-5: 
Section 
V checks 
income and 
expenses.
 
Net Rental Income refers to the difference between your rental real estate’s 
monthly rents and expenses (excluding depreciation). Rental property is 
property that you’ve bought for the purpose of renting it out. Therefore, Net 
Rental Income is the profit or loss that you make each month on rental property 
(excluding depreciation). If you’ve recently purchased the rental property, the 
lender counts only 75 percent of the current rent that you’re collecting. If you’ve 
held your rental property long enough to complete a tax return, most lenders 
use the profit or loss (excluding depreciation) reported on your tax return.
If you have other income sources, such as child support or alimony, list them 
on the Other line and describe them in the last portion of this section. The 
more income you can list, the more likely you are to qualify for a mortgage 
with the most favorable terms for you. (To “get credit” for child support 
or alimony, the borrower must be able to prove receipt of the funds. This 
requirement can get sticky, because the ex-spouse may be asked to provide a 
canceled check.)
The Combined Monthly Housing Expense area on the right side of this section 
enables you to tally your current and proposed housing expenses. If you’re 
currently renting, simply enter your rent in the relevant box. Your proposed 
expenses refer to the amount your estimated expenses would total with the 
purchase of the home that you’re expecting to buy. Your mortgage lender or 
broker can help you complete this important section.
If you’re stretching to buy, make sure the estimates your lender or broker 
plugs into the estimated housing expense section are reasonable, not inflated. 
In their efforts to cover their own behinds and to ensure that you don’t get in 
over your head, some mortgage lenders make estimates that are too high. For 
example, if the mortgage lender estimates that homeowners insurance will 

166
Par t III: Landing a Lender
cost you $100 per month, but you already have a quote in hand for good cov-
erage at $80 per month, speak up about the discrepancy.
If you’re on the borderline between qualifying and not qualifying for a loan, 
lenders will be less inclined to approve your loan if a big difference exists 
between your current housing expenses and your proposed expenses as a 
homeowner. Lenders and mortgage brokers refer to people in this situation 
as subjecting themselves to payment shock. If you’re in this situation, assess 
whether you can really afford such a significant increase in your monthly 
housing expenses (see Chapter 1).
VI. Assets and liabilities
In Section VI (see Figure 10-6), you present your personal balance sheet, which 
summarizes your assets and liabilities. Your assets are subdivided into liquid 
(for example, nonretirement-account) assets and those assets that aren’t liquid 
(such as real estate). Liquid, in this example, simply means those assets you 
can sell quickly to come up with cold hard cash for a home purchase or some 
other purpose.
Why so many spaces (four) are allotted to checking and savings accounts 
puzzles us. If you can’t squeeze your other nonretirement holdings in bro-
kerage accounts or mutual funds into the small space provided for Stocks & 
Bonds, use the extra bank account lines and explain what you’re listing there.
Liabilities are any loans or debts you have outstanding. The more of these 
obligations you have, the more unwilling a mortgage lender is to lend you a 
large amount of money.
If you have the cash available to pay off high-cost consumer loans, such as 
credit card loans and auto loans, consider doing so now. These debts gener-
ally carry high interest rates that aren’t tax deductible, and they hurt your 
chances of qualifying for a mortgage (see Chapters 2 and 3 for an explanation 
of this matter).
Note (at the bottom of the liability column) that you’re to list child support 
and alimony payments that you make as well as out-of-pocket expenses 
related to your job if you aren’t self-employed. These monthly expenses are 
like debts in the sense that they require monthly feeding.
Section VI continues over onto page three and includes space for the details of 
rental real estate you already own. If you make a profit from such holdings, that 
profit can help your chances of qualifying for other mortgages. Conversely, 
negative cash flow (property expenses exceeding income) from rentals reduces 
the amount that a mortgage lender will lend you. Most mortgage lenders want 
a copy of your tax return (and possibly copies of your rental agreements with 
tenants) to substantiate the information you enter in this space.

In Section VII (see Figure 10-7), you detail the terms of the proposed home 
purchase or refinance.
 
Figure 10-7:

you.
 
The purpose of the first part of this section is to total the cost of the home, 
including closing costs. After you subtract the expected loan amount, this 
column shows you the amount of money you need to come up with to close 
on the home purchase. Some prospective buyers find that, after they’ve suc-
cessfully completed this section, they must go begging to family or borrow 
more money to close on the purchase.
VIII. Declarations
Figure 10-8 shows what this section looks like. Questions a through i (above 
the dotted line) are potential red flags to lenders. If you answer yes to any of 
these questions, explain yourself on a separate page or in the blank space on 
page four of the application. The other questions are important details that 
lenders need to know. Don’t worry; a yes response here won’t kill your loan 
request.

Turn over page three of the Uniform Residential Loan Application to reveal 
a largely blank page four. This space is for answers that don’t neatly fit else-
where on the application. Here, for example, you may briefly explain the 
reason you’ve changed jobs so often, justify credit problems, list additional 
assets and liabilities, and so on.
If you don’t have anything to put on page four, draw a diagonal line across it 
so the lender knows that you saw it and have nothing to say. Be sure to sign 
at the bottom of this last page as well, even if you don’t write anything on it.
Introducing Other Typical Documents
All mortgage lenders and brokers have their own, individualized package of 
documents for you to complete. The following sections introduce some of the 
other common forms that you’re likely to encounter.

171
 Chapter 10: Managing Mortgage Paperwork
Your right to receive a 
copy of the appraisal
It wasn’t always the case, but you now have the right to receive a copy of the 
appraisal report if you paid for it. To make sure you know this, the govern-
ment requires that mortgage lenders and brokers give you a written notice of 
your right to receive a copy of the appraisal report. (See Figure 10-11.)
 
Figure 10-11: 
This form 
outlines 
your rights

copy of the 
appraisal.
 
APPLICATION NO:
PROPERTY ADDRESS:
You have the right to receive a copy of the appraisal report to be obtained in connection with the
loan for which you are applying, provided that you have paid for the appraisal.  We must receive your
written request no later than 90 days after we notify you about the action taken on your application or
you withdraw your application.  If you would like a copy of the appraisal report contact:

Par t III: Landing a Lender
Despite the fact that the notice tells you to make your request in writing, try 
making the request verbally to save yourself time. Then, if your request is 
ignored, go to the hassle of submitting a written request for your appraisal 
(within 90 days of the rendering of a decision to approve or reject your loan). 
Appraisals are good to have in your files — you never know when an appraisal 
may come in handy. At the very least, you can see what properties were used 
as comparables to yours in order to discover how good or bad the appraisal is.
Equal Credit Opportunity Act
It is a matter of federal law that a mortgage lender may not reject your loan 
because of nonfinancial personal characteristics such as race, gender, mari-
tal status, age, and so forth. You also don’t have to disclose income that you 
receive as a result of being divorced. (We think, however, that disclosing 
such income is in your best interests, because that income may help get your 
loan approved.)
If you have reason to believe that a mortgage lender is discriminating against 
you, contact and file a complaint with the state department of financial insti-
tutions, Department of Real Estate, or whatever government division regu-
lates mortgage lenders in your state. And start hunting around for a better, 
more ethical lender.

Refinancing and

Y
our sister-in-law, your neighbor, and your co-worker 
just refinanced their homes. They claim that they 
substantially reduced their payments and shortened the 
length of their loans. Hey, can you do that? In this part, we 
take the mystery out of refinancing and present a realistic 
view of your options.
And speaking of options, did you know that you might 
qualify for a reverse mortgage? That’s a loan against your 
home that you don’t have to repay as long as you live 
there. Instead, the lender sends you money. Read all about

M
any people imagine a mystical, esoteric difference between the mort-
gage used to purchase a home and a refinance (refi) loan. In 30 seconds 
or less, depending upon how quickly you read, you’ll know where their 
collective trains of thought went off the fiscal track.
In terms of principal, interest, loan term, amortization, security instruments, 
and all the other fascinating stuff we cover in Chapter 4, you can’t find any 
difference between purchase and refi mortgages. And even though Chapter 
5 ostensibly pertains to home purchase mortgages, everything we say about 
the advantages and disadvantages of fixed-rate loans versus adjustable-rate 
mortgages applies equally well to refinance loans. Last but not least, the 
financing expenses we detail in Chapter 9 evenhandedly increase the cost of 
obtaining purchase mortgages and refi loans.
 
The sole distinction between a purchase loan and a refinance mortgage is 
whether or not a change of property ownership occurs during the financial 
transaction. When you purchased your dream home, ownership of the house 
transferred from the seller to you. On the other hand, no change of ownership 
occurs when you subsequently opt to replace your existing mortgage with a 
new one. This chapter focuses on the strategic uses of a refi.
Refinancing Rationales
You’re probably not going to refinance the mortgage on your house because 
you suddenly developed an insatiable urge to generate enormous loan fees 

176
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
for your friendly neighborhood lending institution. Here are three far more 
sensible reasons to refinance your mortgage:
 
 To cut costs. “A penny saved is a penny earned,” is every bit as true 
today as it was in Ben Franklin’s time, but why stop with a few lousy 
pennies? Think big. Lowering your monthly loan payment by replacing 
your present mortgage with a new one that offers a lower interest rate 
could save you thousands of dollars over your new loan’s term.
 
 To restructure your financing. Slashing your monthly mortgage pay-
ment isn’t the only reason to refinance. In fact, you may need to refi-
nance even if the new loan won’t save you one red cent. For instance, 
suppose you have a short-term balloon loan (see Chapter 6) coming due 
soon that you must replace with long-term financing. Or maybe you want 
to trade in that volatile adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) used to finance 
your home purchase for a less exciting fixed-rate loan so you can hit the 
sack each night without worrying yourself sick about the possibility of 
your loan’s interest rate skyrocketing.
 
 To pull cash out. If you’ve owned your home a long time, you’ve prob-
ably built up quite a bit of equity in it, thanks to the combined effect of 
paying down your loan and property appreciation. Instead of simply 
replacing the old mortgage with a new one of the same amount, some 
folks pull out additional cash, which they use for such purposes as start-
ing a new business, or helping pay for the kids’ college expenses. We 
suspect that you could probably come up with a couple more ways to 
use some extra money if you really put your mind to it.
 
Refinancing a mortgage isn’t like ordering dinner in a Chinese restaurant where 
you select one item from column A and one from column B. What the heck. It’s 
your refi. You can do whatever you want. If you plan carefully, you may be able 
to accomplish all three objectives when you refinance.
Cost-Cutting Refinances
When asked to rank the refi process in terms of pleasurable life experiences, 
most people list it just above having a tooth filled without anesthetic. Expect 
to be inundated with forms containing thousands of tiny boxes you must either 
check or, worse yet, answer in microscopic detail; to submit piles of substantiat-
ing documents to your lender; and to be slugged by a slew of expenses such as 
loan origination fees, title insurance, escrow charges, and property appraisals.
As a rule, refinancing a mortgage is neither cheap nor easy. But when the 
pleasure of considering how much money you can save by doing a refi exceeds 
the anticipated pain of the process you have to go through to get the savings, 
the time to refinance has arrived.

177
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
Mortgage interest rates rise and fall periodically like a financial tide. 
Sometimes the fiscal tide gently kisses the shore. At other times, however, 
it’s a tidal wave. Over the past 30 years, we’ve seen interest rates for con-
forming 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages range from a high of over 18 percent in 
1981 to a low of around 5.25 percent in 2004.
If you happen to buy a home during a period of relatively high interest rates, 
you’d be smart to seriously consider refinancing your mortgage when inter-
est rates drop. To make your pondering productive and profitable, the follow-
ing sections offer some important factors to consider.
Applying the 2-percent rule
Some well-intentioned but misguided people earnestly advise that there 
must be at least a 2-percentage-point differential between your present 
mortgage’s interest rate and the new loan’s rate before refinancing makes 
economic sense. This tidbit of folk wisdom, straightforwardly referred to as 
the 2-percent rule, is a down-and-dirty rule to help you gauge how quickly 
you’ll get back refinancing costs by using money saved with your new, 
reduced loan payments.
Don’t let the 2-percent rule intimidate you. It’s merely a guideline — not the 
Ten Commandments.
In fairness, the 2-percent rule isn’t utter hooey. The larger the spread 
between your present loan’s interest rate and the new interest rate, the 
faster you’ll recover your refinancing charges (loan origination fee, appraisal, 
title insurance, and the other items we detail in Chapter 9) by using savings 
produced by lower monthly payments. For instance, when the interest rate 
differential is 2 percentage points, you’ll probably recover all the usual refi 
costs in less than two years.
If you don’t plan to sell your house in the next few years, however, interest 
rate spreads smaller than 2 percent are perfectly fine to justify refinancing. A 
1-percentage-point differential between your present loan and the refi mort-
gage, for example, simply means that recovering your refinancing costs will 
take longer. No big deal.
 
If interest rates have declined since you purchased your home, you owe it to 
yourself to explore the economics of a refi. A little dialing for dollars could 
save you big bucks. Nothing can stop you from refinancing your loan again 
(and again) if mortgage rates keep heading south.

178
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
Crunching the numbers
You don’t need a PhD in accounting to determine whether or not a refi 
makes “cents.” However, you must understand the fundamentals we cover in 
Chapter 4 before starting your analysis. By the same token, you should also 
understand how to find the best loan (Chapter 5), how to find good lenders 
(Chapter 7), and how to find your way through the mortgage maze (Chapter 
9). If you haven’t read these fascinating chapters yet, please do so now.
Starting the decision-making process is simple. Call a good lender. Find out 
what the monthly payment would be if you replaced your current loan with a 
new one. Then have the lender estimate the total cost to refinance your loan 
and get it in writing. Armed with these two vital bits of information, you can 
approximate how long it will take to repay the refi charges and start saving 
gobs of greenbacks.
 
Speaking of refinancing costs, one of the biggest bills coming your way is title 
insurance. Like it or not, you must get a new title insurance policy to protect 
your lender from title risks such as delinquent property tax claims that may 
have been recorded against your property since your previous title insurance 
policy was issued. Be sure to ask the title insurance company if you qualify for a 
refinance rate on your new policy. Most firms will give you a sizable rate reduc-
tion — up to 30 percent off their normal title insurance policy premium — if your 
previous policy was issued within five years of the new policy’s issuance date.
Refinancing’s magic formula
Just for the fun of it, assume that your present loan payment is $1,500 a 
month. Your friendly lender offers you a new mortgage with a lower interest 
rate. Your new payment would be $1,250, which would reduce your loan pay-
ment by a sweet $250 a month. However, it would cost you a grand total of 
$4,000 to refinance the loan.
You won’t actually save the full $250 just because your monthly mortgage 
payment is reduced by $250. That’s your pretax saving. Because you’d have 
less mortgage interest to deduct after refinancing, your tax write-offs would 
be reduced accordingly. Here’s a quick way to estimate the amount you’d save 
on an after-tax basis. Multiply the savings by your federal tax rate as we note in 
Table 1-1 of Chapter 1 and then subtract this lost tax savings from your pretax 
savings amount. If you’re in the 28-percent tax bracket, for example, the pretax 
$250 slims down to $180 per month on an after-tax basis ($250 × 28% = $70 lost 
tax savings).
Now comes the important part. Figure the number of months to recover the 
refi costs. Here’s the magic formula to figure out how long it will take you to 
break even if you refinance:

179
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
Refi cost ÷ after-tax monthly savings = months to break-even.
Using the data in our example: $4,000 ÷ $180 = 22.2 months. Simple.
 
Whether or not you ultimately save money when you refinance depends on 
refi costs and after-tax monthly savings. In our example, refinancing wouldn’t 
make sense if you expect to sell your house within the next 22 months. If you 
keep the loan five years, on the other hand, you’ll recover the $4,000 you 
spent in refi costs plus a nifty $6,800 in savings ($180 per month × 60 months = 
$10,800 – $4,000 cost = 6,800 excellent reasons to refinance).
 
When we factored in the lost federal income tax savings by refinancing to a 
lower monthly payment, we ignored state income taxes. As you may know all 
too well from personal experience, some states also have significant income 
taxes. If you live in such a state, you may want to factor those lost tax savings 
into your refinance calculations.
Fewer points don’t always great loans make
The biggest refi expense is usually the loan origination fee or points. As we 
explain in Chapter 9, a point is equal to one percent of the loan amount. The 
relationship between the interest rate on a mortgage and that same loan’s 
points can best be thought of as a seesaw; one end of the seesaw is the loan’s 
interest rate, and the other end of the seesaw represents the loan’s points. 
So, if you pay less in points, the ongoing interest rate will be higher.
Suppose that during your quest for the best loan you find two lenders offer-
ing a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 6.5-percent interest. One lender wants 
two points for the loan. The other lender keenly desires your business and 
offers the same 6.5-percent rate for a mere one and a half points. Assuming 
that all other refi costs are equal, of course you’d grab the loan with lower 
points. We’re proud of you, brilliant reader.
Unfortunately, most refinancing situations aren’t that straightforward. Don’t 
reflexively grab a loan simply because it has low points. Lenders usually offer 
a wide variety of mortgages. Some loans have relatively low points, others 
“no points,” and a few even have “no points or fees.” The tradeoff for these 
seemingly good deals is a higher interest rate over the life of the loan. There 
are no free lunches in the merciless world of high finance.
Here’s how to determine whether you’re really getting a bargain. On a 
$200,000 mortgage, for example, suppose that your new best pal, the lender, 
offered you either a 6.5-percent interest rate loan with a two-point loan fee 
($200,000 × 2% = $4,000) or a 6.75-percent interest rate mortgage for one and 
a half points ($200,000 × 1.5% = $3,000).

Taking the one-and-a-half-point loan saves $1,000 ($4,000 – $3,000) in loan 
costs, but its monthly payment is $1,297 versus $1,264 for the mortgage with a 
two-point loan fee. So, if you opt for the 6.75-percent mortgage, you’ll pay $33 
more per month ($24 after factoring in tax savings if you’re in the 28-percent 
federal tax bracket) over the remaining term of the loan because of the higher 
interest rate. (We ignore tax savings in the following comparison because 
points and monthly interest are both ultimately deductible.) Good deal?
Consider a slight variation of our magic formula to find out:
Refi cost difference ÷ monthly savings = months to break even.
Per our second example: $1,000 ÷ $33 = 30 months.
In this example, take the loan with the 1.5-percent loan origination fee if you 
aren’t planning to keep it at least 30 months. If you plan to hold the loan more 
than 30 months, however, pay the two-point fee to get the lower interest rate.
Restructuring Refinances
Like it or not, certain situations demand that you absolutely must replace an 
existing mortgage with new financing even if you won’t save a dime by doing 
so. In other circumstances, strange as it may seem, you voluntarily refinance 
your present mortgage to achieve nonfinancial benefits such as peace of mind.
Restructuring when you need to
First, we cover forced restructuring. A philosopher once sagely observed that 
death is nature’s way of telling us to slow down. By the same token, a balloon 
loan’s imminent due date is a fiscal wake-up call that it’s time to refinance 
your mortgage.
If you have a short-term first or second mortgage coming due, you have three 
choices:
 
 Replace your short-term financing with a long-term loan. Be proactive. 
You know darn good and well when your loan will be due and payable. 
Don’t wait until the last minute to refinance it. Begin exploring your refi 
options long before you must pay off your present loan to make sure you 
get the optimum interest rate and terms on your new mortgage. Read 
Chapter 5 to decide whether a fixed-rate mortgage, adjustable-rate 
mortgage, or hybrid loan is your best long-term financing option.

181
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
 
 Refinancing may take longer than you expect — plan on 45 to 60 days. 
And don’t think the process will go perfectly. Documents have a dis-
quieting way of getting lost. People are often slow responding to lender 
inquiries for verification of employment, verification of deposits, and 
the like. Loan processors get sick or take vacations. The list of potential 
calamities is endless. Allow enough lead time to handle the last-minute 
problems that will inevitably rear their ugly heads. Don’t let time bully 
you into paying late charges or, worse yet, being rushed into taking a 
bad refi loan.
 
 Get another short-term loan. If you have a small second loan coming 
due, it may be more economical to either pay it off or replace it with a 
new second instead of refinancing your present first and second mort-
gages. By the same token, if you plan to sell your house within the next 
year or two, don’t pay a premium for refi financing. Get a no-points, 
no-fee loan to tide you over.
 
 Rather than go through the expense and aggravation of a refi, see 
whether the holder of your present mortgage will extend the loan’s due 
date long enough to accommodate your plans. Especially when owner-
carry financing is involved, this approach may be the easiest way to 
solve your financial problem.
Tax treatment of refi points
After advising you that there isn’t a smidgen of 
difference between a home purchase loan and a 
refi loan, we blushingly wish to draw your atten-
tion to a difference — not in the mortgages, but 
in the way the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
treats the respective loan origination fees. We 
certainly don’t want you to get in trouble with 
the IRS.
When you bought your home, the points you 
were charged to get your purchase mortgage 
were fully deductible in the year in which you 
paid them. However, when you refinance, the 
loan origination fee for your refi mortgage must 
be amortized (spread out) over the life of your 
new loan.
For instance, suppose you paid two points to 
get a $300,000 mortgage several years ago 
when you bought your home. You deducted 
the full $6,000 ($300,000 × 2%) loan fee on the 
federal tax return that you filed for the year you 
purchased your home. That was an impressive 
deduction.
Now you’ve decided to pay two points to refi-
nance your original mortgage for a snazzy new, 
improved $300,000 loan with a lower interest 
rate. This time, though, you have to divide the 
$6,000 loan origination fee by the 30-year term 
of your mortgage, giving you a deduction of just 
$200 per year ($6,000 ÷ 30 years).
The IRS isn’t completely heartless. If you refi-
nance again because interest rates continue 
to drop or you pay the refi loan off when you 
sell your house, it’ll allow you to deduct the 
unamortized (remaining) portion of your points 
at that time. For example, if you sell your house 
three years after refinancing, you can deduct 
the remaining $5,400 ($6,000 – $200 per year × 
3 years) then.

182
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
 
 Sell the property. If, for some reason, you can’t qualify for a refi and the 
holder of your current loan won’t extend the loan’s due date until your 
prospects improve, sell the property before it goes into foreclosure. Don’t 
wait for a miracle. Take command of the situation rather than allowing 
yourself to become a victim. House Selling For Dummies, which we also 
wrote (published by Wiley), is filled with proven ways to sell your prop-
erty quickly for top dollar. The key to success is giving yourself enough 
lead time to market the house so you can control circumstances rather 
than having them control you.
Voluntary restructuring is a much more pleasant subject. You’re refinancing 
your loan because you want to, not because you’ve run out of other options. 
Believe it or not, you may want to restructure your mortgage even if the refi 
won’t save you money. We tell you why in the following sections.
Getting a fixed-rate to avoid ARM phobia
Some folks hate adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with a passion. Suppose 
you happen to be one of them. Yet, ironically, you got an ARM when you 
bought your home a few years ago because interest rates were high then and 
you couldn’t qualify for the 30-year, fixed-rate loan you really wanted.
Times have changed. Your financial situation is much improved. You can 
finally afford to get rid of that treacherous ARM you despise.
Who cares if that new fixed-rate loan’s interest rate is a smidge higher than 
your ARM’s present interest rate? Everyone knows that the ARM’s interest rate 
can rise. Your peace of mind is worth a few bucks a month. The important 
thing is that you won’t spend any more sleepless nights worrying about future 
interest rate increases. Refinancing into a nice, secure fixed-rate mortgage is 
wonderful if you have ARM phobia.
 
Some ARMs can be converted to fixed-rate mortgages from the 13th to 60th 
month of the loan by paying a fee, usually 1 percent of the remaining loan bal-
ance. This method is usually cheaper and less aggravating than refinancing from 
scratch. If your ARM has this option, find out what the interest rate will be if it’s 
converted to a fixed-rate loan. Sometimes the rate isn’t competitive with new 
fixed-rate loans. For instance, if conforming fixed-rate loans are offered at 6.5 
percent and your lender graciously allows you to convert your ARM to a fixed-
rate loan at 8 percent, economics favor getting the 6.5-percent loan if you plan to 
keep it more than a few years.

183
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
Resetting ARM caps
Nearly any person can figure out why people who have fixed-rate loans refinance 
them when mortgage rates fall. These folks have no other way to get a lower 
interest rate. As the name implies, those interest rates are carved in stone.
Why, however, would anyone with an ARM refinance when rates drop? After 
all, an ARM’s interest rate will adjust itself automatically in time. Wouldn’t it 
be smarter, easier, and cheaper over the long haul to simply leave sleeping 
ARMs alone? Not always. The following sections offer two reasons to refi-
nance an ARM.
Outwitting periodic adjustment caps
Here’s a delightful problem most people never consider. Sometimes interest 
rates fall so rapidly that even adjustable-rate mortgages can’t keep up with 
them. That’s because, as we note in Chapter 5, good ARMs have periodic 
adjustment caps that limit how much the interest rate can be changed up or 
down during a periodic rate adjustment.
For example, suppose you have an ARM that permits interest rate adjust-
ments once a year. Its periodic adjustment cap restricts the maximum rate 
increase or decrease to not more than 2 percent annually. You’re confident 
that you can handle worst-case increases without going into catatonic pay-
ment shock. For some strange reason, handling payment decreases never 
concerned you.
Good news. You just received a letter from your lender saying that your 
ARM’s current 8.75-percent interest rate will drop to 6.75 percent at the next 
adjustment. Once again, you congratulate yourself for not getting a fixed-rate 
mortgage like so many of your chicken-hearted friends. You feel slightly less 
pleased when you notice that the interest rate would have been even lower 
except for the loan’s 2-percent periodic adjustment cap.
“Fair is fair,” you mutter to calm yourself. “My ARM’s cap works both ways. It 
also protects me from getting hammered by huge rate increases. And, if rates 
stay low, I’ll get the extra savings next year anyway.”
Then your next-door neighbor comes over for a visit. She proudly says that 
she decided to dump her fixed-rate loan and get an ARM exactly like yours 
from your lender. Truth be known, her adjustable-rate mortgage isn’t exactly 
like yours. Its interest rate will be just 4.5 percent for the first year.
You think about all the money you’ll leave on the table each month. Even if 
you get another maximum rate reduction, you’ll be down to only 4.75 percent 
a year from now. Worse yet, interest rates may not remain low.

184
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
Conversely, by refinancing now, you won’t have to worry about interest rates 
staying low. Even if rates skyrocket, your ARM’s interest rate would be lower 
after the first periodic rate adjustment than it is now (4.5% + 2% maximum 
increase = 6.5% worst case 12 months from now versus 6.75% currently). How 
can you lose?
 
As we discuss in Chapter 5, an ARM’s initial interest rate is only one thing to 
consider when you select a mortgage. You must evaluate all the features of 
an ARM to make sure that it’s the best loan for you. Remember: Lenders offer 
ARMs because they’re usually good for the lender.
Limiting lifetime caps
Good ARMs have another important feature: lifetime caps that set interest 
rate limits over the full term of the loan. Life-of-loan caps are usually 5 to 6 
percent higher than an ARM’s initial interest rate.
The initial interest rate on your neighbor’s ARM isn’t the only significant dif-
ference between her loan and yours. Both of your mortgages have 6-percent 
lifetime caps, but the similarity ends there. Because your ARM’s initial inter-
est rate was 7.25 percent, it can go as high as 13.25 percent (7.25% start rate 
+ 6% life cap). Her loan peaks at a worst-case 10.5 percent (4.5% start rate + 
6% life cap).
 
Most people never consider that, like fixed-rate loans, you can ratchet down 
an ARM’s interest rate ceiling. Refinancing an ARM not only reduces your 
monthly payments, it also slashes your upside interest rate risk.
Choosing the fast-forward mortgage
 
If you’re willing to forgo small, immediate monthly savings to eventually get a 
huge pot of gold, you may consider replacing your present 30-year mortgage 
with a 15-year loan. This restructuring plan could save you hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in interest charges over the life of your new, improved mort-
gage. We discuss the pros and cons of this radical course of action in Chapter 5.
Cash-Out Refinances
A cash-out refi differs from the cost cutting and the restructuring refinances 
we cover in the preceding sections in one important aspect — rather than 
replacing your current loan with another one for the same amount of money, 
you pull extra cash out of the property when you refinance it. You can do this 
in two ways:

185
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
 
 Get a new first mortgage. If you’re going to refinance your existing 
mortgage (because you want to cut costs or must restructure your 
financing), this situation could be an ideal opportunity to free up some 
of that equity you’ve accumulated. As long as getting extra cash won’t 
jack up your new mortgage’s interest rate and you have a good use for 
the money (such as investing in a new business or paying off a pile of 
high-interest-rate consumer debts), go for it. However, be sure you can 
afford to borrow all this extra money — see Chapter 1.
 
 Get a home equity loan. Don’t disturb your existing loan if you’re happy 
with your present first mortgage, if you want to tap only a small amount 
of your equity, if you won’t need all the cash at once, or if you don’t 
need the money for very long. See our discussion of home equity loans 
in Chapter 6.
Pulling cash out of your property may jack up your refi mortgage’s interest 
rate. Why? Lenders have gathered statistical proof over the years that taking 
cash out of property for nonmortgage purposes (versus pouring the money 
right back into the home by adding a bathroom or modernizing the kitchen, 
for instance) increases the probability of a future loan default.
 
Due to a huge increase in foreclosures during the late 2000s, lenders started 
putting cash-out refinances under a microscope. As noted in Chapter 2, lenders 
now impose extremely stringent loan restrictions on any market they consider 
risky because home prices in the area are declining. Be sure to ask your lender 
whether your property is located in what it considers a declining market. 
Chapter 2 covers the topic of problem appraisals in great detail.
As you know if you’ve read Chapter 2, lenders believe that the lower your 
property’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, the lower the odds that you’ll eventu-
ally default on your loan — and vice versa. Lenders generally charge higher 
interest rates and loan fees or make you pay mortgage insurance for purchase 
loans if the LTV ratio exceeds 80 percent. For cash-out refinances, on the 
other hand, many lenders jack up rates and fees when the LTV ratio exceeds 
75 percent of appraised value.
To see the difference this policy makes:
Suppose you put $30,000 cash down and got a $120,000 first mortgage with an 
8-percent interest rate ten years ago when you bought your dream home for 
$150,000. The LTV ratio then was a nice, safe 80 percent (your $120,000 loan 
divided by the $150,000 appraised value).
Fast forward to today. You’re ecstatic. Your home just appraised for $225,000. 
You intend to replace the faithful old loan you’ve had all these years with a 

186
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
new $180,000 first mortgage, which is 80 percent of the current appraised value 
($180,000 ÷ $225,000). After paying off the $105,000 remaining principal balance 
of your old loan and $5,000 of refi expenses, you believe you’ll get a check for 
$70,000 ($180,000 new loan – $105,000 loan payoff – $5,000 refi costs = $70,000 
cash out of the refi).
“Wow!” you think to yourself. “I’ll have my $30,000 out of the house and 
another $40,000 to boot. And I’ll still have $45,000 equity left in the property 
($225,000 appraised value – $180,000 new loan). I can buy that red convert-
ible I’ve been dreaming about, take a first-class cruise around the world, and 
still have cash in the bank when I get home. Life is good — and so is home 
ownership.”
 
Not so fast, dear reader. Before you mentally spend all that cash, see whether 
your lender is one of those that increases interest rates ¼ to ½ percent on 
80-percent, LTV cash-out refinances. If so, either reduce your refinance’s LTV 
ratio to 75 percent or shop around to see whether you can find a lender with 
equally competitive rates on 80-percent, LTV cash-out refinances.
 
The cash you pull out of your property may seem like found money. It isn’t. 
You probably worked pretty darn hard for the cash you used to buy your 
home. You’re working just as hard to pay off your loan. As you can see when 
you read about reverse mortgages in Chapter 12, the equity you’re accumu-
lating in your property can be transformed into retirement income someday 
or used for another worthwhile purpose unless, of course, you squander it. 
Never borrow money needlessly. Your home isn’t a piggy bank.
Expediting Your Refi
Most folks don’t dawdle after they’ve made the decision to refinance their 
mortgage. As far as they’re concerned, the sooner they get that new, improved 
financing in place and start saving money (or at least get a good night’s sleep), 
the better.
If you want fast action, here are five ways to speed up the refinancing process:
 
 Fill out your loan application completely. Line out any items that don’t 
apply to you so the lender knows you haven’t overlooked them or for-
gotten to answer them. If you aren’t sure how to answer a question, ask 
your loan officer for assistance rather than leaving the question blank. 
Incomplete applications have a mysterious way of ending up at the 
bottom of the loan processor’s pile. See Chapter 10 for more tips on how 
to best complete your loan application.

187
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
 
 Attach copies of all pertinent documents to your loan application. 
Always include a copy of your latest pay stub. If you’re self-employed, 
give the lender copies of your two most recent tax returns. Make a file 
copy of the completed application in case the original gets misplaced.
 
 The easier you make things for the appraiser, the faster your appraisal 
will be completed. For example, if you have a floor plan of your home, 
give it to the appraiser to help determine square footage. Provide copies 
of invoices for any improvements you’ve made to the property since you 
bought it.
 
 Don’t “protect” yourself by submitting loan applications to several lend-
ers. Each loan application you file triggers its own set of title and appraisal 
requests. During a hot market or when interest rates stop declining and 
turn higher, having to wait for multiple applications to be evaluated at 
multiple lenders can take a long time. As we recommend in Chapter 7, you 
should shop around; but after you find your first choice, focus your time 
and energy on getting that application done and approved.
 
 Comparable sales data help the appraiser establish your home’s cur-
rent fair market value. Give the appraiser information (address, sale 
price, date of sale, and so on) about houses comparable to yours that 
have sold within the past six months. To be valid “comps,” the proper-
ties must be similar to your home in size, age, condition, and must be 
located in the immediate vicinity of your house. The real estate agent 
who represented you when you bought your home will probably be 
delighted to provide this information. Smart agents like to stay on the 
good side of their clients.
 
 Don’t be greedy. When your loan is ready to fund, take the money and 
run. Delaying the loan funding because you think mortgage rates may go 
down a notch or two further may turn out to be a costly mistake. Rates 
move in both directions. They could go north, not south, while you’re 
waiting. Don’t give mortgage gods a malicious laugh at your expense.
Beating Borrower’s Remorse
Residential real estate is riddled with remorse. Remorse eventually rears its 
repulsive head in almost every purchase, sale, and refi.
Sometimes, borrowers get a mild case of remorse to which the balm of logic 
can be applied. Other times, however, no amount of reasoning with the 
infected party will suffice — masochism reigns supreme until the disease 
runs its course.
If you’re reading this chapter, you’ve most likely already suffered through a 
bout of buyer’s remorse. Remember that sickening feeling you got after the 

188
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators
sellers accepted your offer? You were absolutely certain you’d offered too 
much money for the house. To prove it, you continued visiting Sunday open 
houses and kept scrutinizing the classified ads searching for homes with lower 
asking prices that were bigger and better than the one you were buying.
Unbeknownst to you, the sellers were probably going through the exact same 
exercise in reverse. Shortly after they signed the contract, they convinced 
themselves they were giving their house away. To prove it, they spent week-
ends touring open houses and devoured real estate ads looking for houses 
with higher asking prices that weren’t as nice as the one they were selling.
Exhaustion wears most buyers and sellers down eventually. Buyers see 
enough comps to reinforce the validity of their purchase price. Ditto sellers 
for the sale price. Logic prevails. Life returns to normal.
Borrower’s remorse is equally devastating. This dreadful scourge appears in 
two incarnations whenever mortgage rates are in a state of flux.
Phase I borrower’s remorse
Suppose you bought a home when interest rates were on the high end of a 
periodic cycle. The best loan you could get at the time was a 30-year, fixed-
rate mortgage at 8.5-percent interest. Now interest rates are falling, and 
you’re agonizing. To lock (your new loan’s interest rate) or not to lock?
For instance, people who replaced 8.5-percent loans with new ones when 
rates hit 7.5 percent kicked themselves as rates continued to fall. In a declin-
ing interest rate market, the situation wasn’t much better for people who 
waited until rates hit 7.25 percent, 7 percent, or 6.75 percent to refinance.
Phase I borrower’s remorse strikes whenever interest rates fall. Here’s what 
it sounds like: “Darn it! Interest rates just dropped another 1/4 point. I knew I 
should have waited a little longer to refinance my loan. Look how much more 
money I could have saved if only I had waited. Everyone said rates would go 
lower. Why didn’t I listen? Why was I so impetuous? What a fool I am!”
 
Don’t beat yourself up, dear reader. Instead of dwelling on how much money 
you could have saved if you had waited to refinance, focus on how much money 
you are saving each month because you refinanced. Sure, as it turns out you 
could have done a little better. On the other hand, rates may have gone up 
instead of down. Your new loan payment is an improvement on the old one, isn’t 
it? You’re better off financially than you were, aren’t you? You know the magic 
formula to determine a refi’s break-even point. If rates keep falling, you can 
refinance again. For the time being, however, savor your savings.

189
 Chapter 11: Refinancing Your Mortgage
Phase II borrower’s remorse
When dealing with mortgage rates, what goes down inevitably goes back up. 
It’s the nature of the beast. Sooner or later, every cycle of interest-rate reduc-
tions hits rock bottom and starts north. When that happens, you enter Phase 
II of borrower’s remorse. Phase II makes Phase I look like a walk in the park.
“Why did I wait so long to refinance? What a fool I am! Look how much money 
I could have saved by refinancing last month. Everyone said rates were going 
to start rising. Why didn’t I listen? Why was I so greedy?”
Phase II is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaar worse than Phase I. All the folks who refinanced 
their loans while interest rates were falling are saving money. True, some of 
them are saving more than others because they got lower interest rates, but 
everyone who refinanced came out ahead to greater or lesser degrees. Some 
people who delayed refinancing because they wanted to get the absolute 
lowest possible interest rate ended up with nothing.
 
The only way to be sure that rates have hit bottom is to watch them start 
going back up again. Whenever that happens, the crush of people who waited 
to refinance added to the normal demand for new home purchase loans 
stresses the mortgage delivery system. Remember the old law of supply 
and demand? The demand for mortgages far exceeds the number of people 
valiantly trying to process them. Lenders will be buried under an avalanche 
of loan applications. Appraisers will have a two-month backlog of appraisal 
orders. Title companies can’t churn out title reports as fast as new requests 
arrive. It’s the fiscal equivalent of a nervous breakdown.
 
Suppose you have a $200,000 loan at 8.5-percent interest with a monthly pay-
ment of $1,538. Suppose you could refinance it today at 6.5 percent. Doing 
so would drop your payment to $1,264 — your payment would be lowered 
$274 per month. If you wait a little longer until rates drop to 6.375 percent, 
however, your payment would drop another $16 a month. But each month 
you have to wait, your loan payment is $1,538. You’re spending an extra $274 
a month in the hopes of maybe reducing your loan payment another $16 per 
month. Not smart. Rates go up every bit as easily as down. Don’t be greedy — 
grab the savings while you can.

f you own a home, a reverse mortgage allows you to tap into its equity (the 
difference between the market value of your home less the mortgage debt 
owed on it) to supplement your retirement income — while you still live in 
your home. Because these mortgages are so different from what most people 
expect, it generally takes a while for the most basic information to sink in. 
Even experienced financial professionals are often surprised to learn how 
these loans really work, how different their costs and benefits can be, and 
what you have to look out for.
Are you full of questions about these types of mortgages? If so, this chap-
ter gives you the lowdown on reverse mortgages and helps you figure out 
whether they’re right for you.
Grasping the Reverse Mortgage Basics
A reverse mortgage is a loan against your home that you don’t have to repay 
as long as you live there. In a regular, or so-called forward mortgage (the kind 
we discuss throughout the rest of this book), your monthly loan repayments 
make your debt go down over time until you’ve paid it all off. Meanwhile, 
your equity is rising as you repay your mortgage and as your property value 
appreciates.

192
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators 
With a reverse mortgage, by contrast, the lender sends you money, and your 
debt grows larger and larger as you keep getting cash advances, make no 
repayment, and interest is added to the loan balance (the amount you owe). 
That’s why reverse mortgages are called rising debt, falling equity loans. As 
your debt (the amount you owe) grows larger, your equity (that is, your home’s 
value minus any debt against it) generally gets smaller.
Reverse mortgages are different from regular home mortgages in two 
important respects:
 
 To qualify for most loans, the lender checks your income to see how 
much you can afford to pay back each month. But with a reverse mort-
gage, you don’t have to make monthly repayments. Thus, your income 
generally has nothing to do with getting a loan or determining the 
amount of the loan.
 
 With a regular mortgage, you can lose your home if you fail to make your 
monthly repayments. With a reverse mortgage, however, you can’t lose 
your home by failing to make monthly loan payments — because you 
don’t have any to make.
 
A reverse mortgage merits your consideration if it fits your circumstances. 
Reverse mortgages may allow you to cost-effectively tap your home’s equity 
and enhance your retirement income. If you have bills to pay, want to buy 
some new carpeting, need to paint your home, or simply feel like eating out 
and traveling more, a good reverse mortgage may be your salvation.
This section focuses on the A-B-Cs of reverse mortgages and helps clarify any 
confusion you may have.
Considering common objections
If you’re like most older homeowners, you worked hard for many years to 
eliminate your mortgage so you’d own your home free and clear. After what 
you’ve gone through, the thought of reversing that process and rebuilding 
the debt owed on your home is troubling. Furthermore, reverse mortgages 
are a relatively new type of loan that few people understand. And most of 
today’s reverse mortgage borrowers are low-income, single seniors who have 
run out of other money for living expenses.
Can you lose your home?
It’s not too surprising that folks who don’t fully understand reverse mort-
gages often have preconceived notions, mostly negative, about how they 
work. Seniors with home equity often erroneously think that taking a reverse 
mortgage may lead to being forced out of their homes or ending up owing 
more than the house is worth.

193
 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
You won’t be forced out of your home. Nor will you (or your heirs) end up 
owing more than your house is worth. Federal law defines reverse mortgages 
to be non-recourse loans, which simply means that the home’s value is the 
only asset that can be tapped to pay the reverse mortgage debt balance. In 
the rare case when a home’s value does drop below the amount owed on the 
reverse mortgage, the borrower isn’t on the hook for the extra debt.
 
As detailed later in this chapter (see the section “When do you pay the money 
back?”), not keeping current with your property taxes and homeowners 
insurance can trigger your reverse mortgage going into default and requiring 
payoff. Also, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is now 
considering having borrowers make up for outstanding debt in excess of the 
value of the home but only under the circumstances that the homeowner or 
her heirs are unwilling to sell the home when the reverse mortgage requires 
them to do so.
Would a home equity loan or second mortgage work better?
Some people who are intimidated by having to understand reverse mortgages 
wonder whether it would be simpler to get a home equity loan or a new mort-
gage that allows them to take some equity out of their home. The problem 
with this strategy is that you have to begin paying traditional mortgage loans 
back soon after taking them out.
Suppose you own a home worth $200,000, with no mortgage debt. You decide 
to take out a $100,000, 15-year mortgage at 7-percent interest. Although you’ll 
receive $100,000, you’ll have to begin making monthly payments of $899. No 
problem you may think; I’ll just invest my $100,000 and come out ahead. Wrong!
Most seniors gravitate toward safe bonds, which may yield in the neighbor-
hood of 5 percent — a mere $416 of monthly income — an amount far short 
of your monthly mortgage payments. If you invest in stocks and earn the 
market average return of 10 percent per year, which is by no means guaran-
teed, your returns would amount to more — $833 per month — but still not 
enough to cover your monthly mortgage payment. (We should also note that 
most income from stocks and bonds is taxable at both the federal and state 
level. By contrast, reverse mortgage payments you receive aren’t taxable.)
Here’s another big drawback of taking out a traditional mortgage to supple-
ment your retirement income. The longer you live in the house, the more 
likely you are to run out of money and begin missing loan payments, because 
you drain your principal to supplement inadequate investment returns and 
cover your monthly loan payment. If that happens, unlike with a reverse 
mortgage, the lending institution may foreclose on your loan, and you can 
lose your home.

Who can get a reverse mortgage?
Of course, reverse mortgages aren’t for everyone. As we discuss later in this 
chapter (see the section “Deciding Whether You Want a Reverse Mortgage”), 
alternatives may better accomplish your goal. Also, not everyone qualifies to 
take out a reverse mortgage. Specifically, to be eligible for a reverse mortgage:
 
 You must own your home. As a rule, all the owners must be at least 62 
years old.
 
 Your home generally must be your principal residence — which means 
you must live in it more than half the year.
 
 For the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), your 
home must be a single-family property, a two- to four-unit building, or a 
federally approved condominium or planned-unit development (PUD). 
For a Fannie Mae Home Keeper mortgage, you must have a single-family 
home or condominium. Reverse mortgage programs generally don’t 
lend on mobile homes or cooperative apartments. (At the time this book 
went to press, housing legislation pending in Congress might enable 
reverse mortgages to be done with co-ops. If you own a cooperative 
apartment, check with reverse mortgage lenders and counselors for the 
current status of this legislation.)
 
 If you have any debt against your home, you must either pay it off before 
getting a reverse mortgage or, as most borrowers do, use an immediate 
cash advance from the reverse mortgage to pay it off. If you don’t pay off 
the debt beforehand or don’t qualify for a large enough immediate cash 
advance to do so, you can’t get a reverse mortgage.
How much money can you get and when?
The whole point of taking out a reverse mortgage on your home is to get 
money from the equity in your home. How much can you tap? That amount 
depends mostly on your home’s worth, your age, and the interest and other 
fees a given lender charges. The more your home is worth, the older you are, 
and the lower the interest rate and other fees your lender charges, the more 
money you should realize from a reverse mortgage.
 
 For all but the most expensive homes, the federally insured Home Equity 
Conversion Mortgage (HECM) generally provides the most cash and is 
available in every state.
 
 In general, the most cash goes to the oldest borrowers living in the homes 
of greatest value at a time when interest rates are low. On the other hand, 
the least cash generally goes to the youngest borrowers living in the 
homes of lowest value at a time when interest rates are high.

195
 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
The total amount of cash you actually end up getting from a reverse mortgage 
depends on how it’s paid to you plus other factors. You can choose among the 
following options to receive your reverse mortgage money:
 
 Monthly: Most people need monthly income to live on. Thus, a commonly 
selected reverse mortgage option is monthly payments. However, not 
all monthly payment options are created equal. Some reverse mortgage 
programs commit to a particular monthly payment for a preset number 
of years. Other programs make payments as long as you continue living 
in your home or for life. Not surprisingly, if you select a reverse mortgage 
program that pays you over a longer period of time, you generally receive 
less monthly — probably a good deal less — than from a program that 
pays you for a fixed number of years.
 
 Line of credit: Rather than receiving a monthly check, you can simply 
create a line of credit from which you draw money by writing a check 
whenever you need income. Because interest doesn’t start accumulating 
on a loan until you actually borrow money, the advantage of a credit line 
is that you pay only for the money you need and use. If you have fluctu-
ating and irregular needs for additional money, a line of credit may be 
for you. The size of the line of credit is either set at the time you close 
on your reverse mortgage loan or may increase over time.
 
 Lump sum: The third, and generally least beneficial, type of reverse 
mortgage is the lump-sum option. When you close on this type of 
reverse mortgage, you receive a check for the entire amount that you 
were approved to borrow. Lump-sum payouts usually make sense only 
when you have an immediate need for a substantial amount of cash for 
a specific purpose such as making a major purchase, or paying off an 
existing or delinquent mortgage debt to keep from losing your home to 
foreclosure.
 
 Mix and match: Perhaps you need a large chunk of money for some 
purchases you’ve been putting off, but you also want the security of a 
regular monthly income. You can usually put together combinations 
of the preceding three programs. Some reverse mortgage lenders even 
allow you to alter the payment structure as time goes on. Not all reverse 
mortgage programs offer all the combinations, so shop around even 
more if you’re interested in mixing and matching your payment options.
When do you pay the money back?
As we discuss earlier in this chapter (see the section “Considering common 
objections”), some reverse mortgage borrowers worry about having to repay 
their loan balance. Here are the conditions under which you generally have 
to repay a reverse mortgage:

196
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators 
 
 When the last surviving borrower dies, sells the home, or permanently 
moves away. “Permanently” generally means that the borrower hasn’t 
lived in the home for 12 consecutive months.
 
 Possibly, if you do any of the following:
 
• Fail to pay your property taxes
 
• Fail to keep up your homeowners insurance
 
• Let your home fall into disrepair (go to waste)
If you allow your home to go to waste by failing to properly maintain it, the 
lender may be able to make extra cash advances to cover these repair expenses. 
Just remember that reverse mortgage borrowers are still homeowners and 
therefore are still responsible for taxes, insurance, and upkeep.
What do you owe?
The total amount you will owe at the end of the loan (your loan balance) 
equals:
 
 All the cash advances you’ve received (including any used to pay loan 
costs)
 
 Plus all the interest on them — up to the loan’s nonrecourse limit 
(the value of the home)
If you get an adjustable-rate reverse mortgage, the interest rate can vary 
based on changes in published indexes (see Chapter 5). The greater a loan’s 
permissible interest rate adjustment, the lower its interest rate initially. As a 
result, you get a larger cash advance with this type of loan than you do with 
loans that have higher initial interest rates.
You can never owe more than the value of the home at the time the loan is 
repaid. True reverse mortgages are non-recourse loans, which means that in 
seeking repayment the lender doesn’t have recourse to anything other than 
your home — not your income, your other assets, or your heirs’ finances.
Even if you get monthly advances until you’re 115 years old, even if your 
home declines in value between now and then, and even if the total of 
monthly advances becomes greater than your home’s value — you can still 
never owe more than the value of your home. If you or your heirs sell your 
home in order to pay off the loan, the debt is limited by the net proceeds 
from the sale of your home.

197
 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
HUD is now requiring that borrowers make up for outstanding debt in excess of 
the value of the home but only under the circumstances that the homeowner 
or his heirs are unwilling to sell the home when the reverse mortgage requires 
them to do so as outlined in the previous section “When do you pay the 
money back?”
How is the loan repaid?
How a reverse mortgage is repaid depends upon the circumstances under 
which the loan ends:
 
 If you sell and move, you would most likely pay back the loan from the 
money you get from selling your home. But you could pay it back from 
other funds if you had them.
 
 If the loan ends due to the death of the last surviving borrower, the loan 
must be repaid before the home’s title can be transferred to the borrower’s 
heirs. The heirs may repay the loan by selling the home, using other 
funds from the borrower’s estate, using their own funds, or by taking out 
a new forward mortgage against the home.
Not all reverse mortgage borrowers end up living in their homes for the rest 
of their lives. Some folks who originally planned to live in a particular house 
forever subsequently change their minds. Others develop health problems 
that force them to move. So it makes sense to plan for the possibility that you 
may sell and move some day. How much equity would be left if you did?
If, at the end of the loan, your loan balance is less than the value of your home 
(or your net sale proceeds if you sell), then you or your heirs get to keep the 
difference. The lender doesn’t get the house. The lender gets paid the amount 
you owe, and you or your heirs keep the rest of the house’s proceeds of sale.
 
If you take the loan as a credit line account, be sure to withdraw all your 
remaining available credit before the loan ends. You have access to the money 
sooner that way, and the amount could be more than otherwise may be left. 
For example, a growing credit line could become greater than the leftover 
equity if the home’s value decreases.
What’s the out-of-pocket cost 
of getting a reverse mortgage?
The out-of-pocket cash cost to you with a reverse mortgage is usually limited 
to just two modest items. First is an application fee that covers a property 

198
Par t IV: Refinancing and Other Money Generators 
appraisal (to see how much your home is worth). Second is a minimal credit 
check (to see whether you’re delinquent on any federally insured loans).
Other costs, including the loan origination fee, can be financed with the loan. 
This means you can use reverse mortgage funds advanced to you at closing 
to pay the costs due at that time and later advances to pay any ongoing costs 
such as monthly servicing fees. The advances are added to your loan balance 
and become part of what you owe — and pay interest on.
What are the other reverse 
mortgage costs?
The specific cost items vary from one program to another. Many of them are of 
the same type found on forward mortgages: interest charges, origination fees, 
and whatever third-party closing costs (title search and insurance, surveys, 
inspections, recording fees, and mortgage taxes) are required in your area.
Two other costs unique to some reverse mortgages are the monthly servicing 
fee, which can cost up to $35 per month, and a reverse mortgage insurance 
premium, which can cost up to 2 percent of the home’s value at closing plus 
one-half of one percent added to the annual interest rate and charged on the 
loan balance each month.
 
Within the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) pro-
gram, the costs that may be different from one lender to another are the origi-
nation fee, the servicing fee, third-party closing costs, and the interest rate. To 
get the best deal, compare these specific costs.
It’s difficult to evaluate or compare the true, total cost of reverse mortgages 
because that amount ultimately depends upon the following:
 
 How long you end up keeping the loan
 
 The cash advances you receive during the loan
 
 The interest rate charged on the loan
 
 Your home’s value when the loan is over
You can, however, compare the costs of different reverse mortgages by evalu-
ating each loan’s total annual average loan cost, also known as the total annual 
rate. We give you more information about that in the following section.

199
 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
What’s the total annual rate?
The total annual rate on a reverse mortgage includes all of the loan’s costs. 
On any given loan, total annual rates depend on two major factors:
 
 Time
 
 Appreciation
Total annual average rates are generally greatest in the early years of the 
loan and decrease over time, for two reasons:
 
 The initial fees and costs become a smaller part of the total amount 
owed as years go by.
 
 The likelihood increases that the rising loan balance will catch up to — 
and then be limited by — the non-recourse limit the longer you have the 
loan.
Total annual rates also depend on changes in a home’s value over time. The 
less appreciation, the greater the likelihood that a rising loan balance will 
catch up to — and then be limited by — the home’s value. On the other hand, 
when a home appreciates at a robust rate, the loan balance may never catch 
up to (and be limited by) it.
If you end up living in your home well past your projected life expectancy or 
your home appreciates at a lower rate than anticipated, you may get a true 
bargain. But if you die, sell, or move within just a few years or if your home 
appreciates a lot, the true cost could be quite high.
When deciding to go with a reverse mortgage, you simply can’t avoid the fun-
damental risk that the true cost could end up being quite high. You just have 
to understand the risk in general, assess the potential range of total rates on 
a specific loan, and decide whether the risk is worth the benefits you expect 
to get from the loan.
Just remember, total annual rates aren’t really comparable to the interest 
rates quoted on forward mortgages because:
 
 Total annual rates include all the costs.
 
 Reverse mortgages require no monthly repayments.
 
 Reverse mortgages can provide an open-ended monthly income guaran-
tee or a guaranteed credit line (which may grow larger).
 
 You can never owe more than your home’s worth, even if its net value is 
less than what your loan balance would otherwise have been.

How do reverse mortgages affect your 
government-sponsored benefits?
Social Security and Medicare benefits aren’t affected by reverse mortgages. 
But Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid are different. Reverse 
mortgages will affect these and other public benefit programs under certain 
circumstances:
 
 Loan advances generally don’t affect your benefits if you spend them 
during the calendar month in which you get them. But if you keep an 
advance past the end of the calendar month (in a checking or savings 
account, for example), it counts as a liquid asset. If your total liquid 
assets at the end of any month are greater than $2,000 for a single 
person or $3,000 for a couple, you could lose your eligibility.
 
 If anyone in the business of selling annuities has tried to sell you on the 
idea of using proceeds from a reverse mortgage to purchase an annuity, 
you need to know that annuity advances reduce SSI benefits dollar-for-
dollar and can make you ineligible for Medicaid. So if you’re considering 
an annuity and if you’re now receiving — or expect that someday you 
may qualify for — SSI or Medicaid, check with the SSI, Medicaid, and 
other program offices in your community. Get specific details on how 
annuity income affects these benefits.
Shopping for a Reverse Mortgage
Reverse mortgages give you a new retirement financial option that previous 
generations of homeowners didn’t have. These loans can provide an impor-
tant new source of retirement cash — without requiring you to leave your 
home or to make loan payments for as long as you live there.
But you have to proceed carefully. What you don’t know about reverse mort-
gages can hurt you. The most important — and perhaps surprising — facts 
you need to understand are these:
 
 You may get a lot more cash from one reverse mortgage program than 
from another.
 
 The true cost of one program may be much greater than the cost of 
another.

201
 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
 
 A program giving you significantly more cash may also cost less than 
any other may.
 
 To find the program that works best for you, you have to take both of 
the following into account:
 
• How much total cash would be available to you in growing versus 
flat credit lines
 
• The comparative total annual rate on competing loans
 
 Some lenders don’t have the computer software that can show you this 
information.
 
 Lenders offering a variety of plans may try to sell you one plan versus 
another because they make more money on it.
Making major choices
Which reverse mortgage plan — if any — would work the best for you?
 
 The federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is most 
likely to provide more cash at a lower cost, especially if you want a credit 
line, or if you own your home jointly with a spouse or other person.
 
 But the Fannie Mae Home Keeper plan may provide more cash and in 
some cases cost less, especially if you want a monthly advance only, or 
if your home is worth a lot more than the median home value in your 
county.
At the end of this section, you can find more details on the importance 
of considering all your options. And later in this chapter (see the section 
“Deciding Whether You Want a Reverse Mortgage”), we give you more 
detailed information.
Examining all your options
Although HECM may be more likely to provide significantly more cash at a lot 
lower cost on the credit lines most consumers prefer, the best plan for you 
depends on your specific situation. So you need to consider all your reverse 
mortgage options. That’s especially important if you:
 
 Want a monthly loan advance only
 
 Live in a home worth substantially more than the median value in your 
county (this could be single national limit if new legislation passes in 
Congress)

Using the online calculator
To explore the amount you could receive from a reverse mortgage, click on 
the Loan Calculator at www.aarp.org/revmort.
Calculating your reverse mortgage benefits at the Web site is easy. After you 
click on Loan Calculator, you just need to type in answers to these questions:
 
 When were you born?
 
 When was your spouse (or other co-owner) born?
 
 How much is your house worth?
 
 What zip code is the home in?
After you type this information, you get a quick estimate of the largest amount 
of cash you can get through the two largest reverse mortgage programs:
 
 The federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)
 
 The Fannie Mae Home Keeper mortgage
These estimates are based on current interest rates, maximum financeable 
loan fees, and an estimated national average total for third-party closing 
costs. Based on these assumptions, the estimates show how much cash you 
could get from each plan by choosing one of the following types of advances:
 
 Immediate cash advance at loan closing — that is, on the first day of the 
loan
 
 Credit line account that allows you to withdraw cash at any time after 
closing
 
 Monthly cash advance for as long as you live in your home or (if 
coupled with an annuity) for life, no matter where you live
As you review your estimates, remember that if you currently have any debt 
on your home and don’t pay it off before getting a reverse mortgage, you 
must take at least that amount as an immediate cash advance at closing to 
pay off your debt. If you don’t qualify for enough cash to pay off any debt on 
your home at closing, you can’t get a reverse mortgage.
The online calculator shows you the initial annual rate at which credit lines 
grow, and it projects the total amount of available credit that would be left in 
the future assuming no prior use. Click on the Creditline button that lets you 
select specific credit line draws to see how much money would remain avail-
able to you after each draw.

 Chapter 12: Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income
Deciding Whether You Want
a Reverse Mortgage
Only you can decide what a reverse mortgage is worth to you. The value 
probably most depends on your purpose for the money, such as:
 
 Increasing your monthly income
 
 Having a cash reserve (credit line account) for irregular or unexpected 
expenses
 
 Paying off debt that requires monthly repayments
 
 Repairing or improving your home
 
 Getting the services you need to remain independent
 
 Improving the quality of your life
One approach is to consider a major alternative: selling your home and 
moving. Think about the following questions:
 
 How much money could you get by selling your home?
 
 What would it cost you to buy and maintain or rent a new one?
 
 How much could you safely earn (that is, without exposing yourself to 
excessive risk) on sale proceeds not used for a new home?
House Selling For Dummies, which we co-authored (published by Wiley), can 
help you think through the issues. If you do decide to sell your home, our 
book will help you get top dollar.

Please be aware that HUD now permits counselors to charge borrowers a fee 
based upon ability to pay and allows lenders to pay for the counseling so the 
independence of the counseling may be compromised.

Ten (Or So) “Must-Knows” 
about Foreclosure
In This Chapter
 Opening your eyes to your situation and options
 Knowing the best sources for objective information and advice
 Understanding the realities of foreclosure investing
L
enders have a contractual right to take over ownership of a property 
(foreclose) if the borrower can’t make required payments. Even in the 
best of times, some foreclosures occur, but the number of foreclosures acceler-
ates during soft real estate markets or because of risky loans. In the mid to late 
2000s, the number of foreclosures increased tremendously as real estate prices 
declined and numerous borrowers found themselves saddled with high cost 
mortgages.
Having the home in which you’re living end up in foreclosure is a nasty, unpleas-
ant experience for most folks. In most instances, homeowners become overex-
tended with their bills and simply can’t afford to muster their mortgage payment. 
Meanwhile, some homeowners whose properties end up in foreclosure aren’t 
in dire financial straits. Instead, they choose to walk away from a property that 
dropped in value. As we note in Chapter 3, either course of action will probably 
have severe repercussions on your credit score and ability to borrow in the future.
In other cases, overextended investors walk away from multiple properties 
that declined in value. Rather than continuing to make payments on property 
that’s worth less than they paid for it, some investors cut and run. According 
to an analysis by the Mortgage Bankers Association, about one in five proper-
ties ending up in foreclosure recently were investment (non-owner occupied) 
properties.
This chapter is geared to homeowners who may be in danger of losing their 
home to foreclosure. Some tips also apply to folks attracted to investment 
opportunities on property in foreclosure.

208
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Deal with Reality
Just as a lot of folks do when consumer debt (on credit cards and auto loans) 
gets overwhelming, many people falling behind on their mortgage payments 
want to run and hide. Mortgage statements and bills go unopened and calls 
from the lender go unanswered and unreturned. Some folks with excessive 
credit card bills do the same thing. Sticking your head in the sand when it 
comes to mortgage payments does you no good. You’ll lose your home if you 
don’t take action now.
 
The sooner you contact your lender and level with them about your prob-
lems, the better. Explain your financial situation, debt burdens, and what you 
can afford to pay monthly on your mortgage. That said, don’t allow any person 
at a financial institution to berate or verbally abuse you. Find a way to do the 
best you can. Avail yourself of counseling and try negotiating better mortgage 
terms (both these topics are covered later in this chapter).
Heed this sage advice from veteran mortgage professional Chris Bruno:
“Whether one is in foreclosure, contemplating foreclosure, or buying a fore-
closed property, getting competent professional help early in the process is 
extremely important for a more favorable outcome. I have seen many people 
come to me at the 11th hour having never responded to the complaint. Needless 
to say, it’s very stressful and the delay only limited their options and made the 
whole process much more expensive.”
Review Your Spending and Debts
The first step in taking the bull by the horns when you’re drowning in mortgage 
debt is to zoom out to 30,000 feet and look at your entire financial situation. 
Tabulate all your debts and spending. Identify expenses you can most easily 
reduce. Although your housing expenses are a significant portion of your total 
expenditures, they’re probably less than the majority of your typical monthly 
expenses.
Please complete the worksheets in Chapter 1 of this book to help you identify 
ways to reduce your spending and debts, including consumer debts. For detailed 
assistance with analyzing your spending and debts, see the latest edition of 
Eric’s Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley).

 Chapter 13: Ten (Or So) “Must-Knows” about Foreclosures 
Beware of Foreclosure Scams
Perhaps the only thing worse in the real estate world than falling behind on your 
payments and entering the foreclosure process is falling prey to the circling vul-
tures trying to take advantage of your hardship and lack of financial knowledge. 
In the late 2000s, increasing numbers of scoundrels and hucksters made claims 
that they could stop foreclosure no matter what the situation. After charging 
fees of $1,000+ and doing little if anything, in the worst cases, unsuspecting hom-
eowners sign over ownership of their property (and begin making rental pay-
ments) to the con artists!
 
Only make use of counselors approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). We explain how to find these good guys and gals 
in the “Make Use of Objective Counseling” section later in this chapter.
Consider Tapping Other Assets
As long as you’re not going to declare bankruptcy (check out the “Understand 
Bankruptcy” section later in this chapter), you should make a list of assets 
you might tap to help meet your mortgage payments. These assets may 
include bank saving accounts, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, cash value life 
insurance policy balances, unneeded personal property you could sell, and 
so on. Be sure you fully understand all tax consequences before liquidating 
any investments to help make mortgage payments.
 
In the unlikely event that you’ll file for bankruptcy protection, don’t use the 
proceeds from other assets for home payments. The reason: you may be able 
to protect and keep those assets if you file for bankruptcy.
Make Use of Objective Counseling
A number of nonprofit organizations offer low-cost or free counseling to 
homeowners in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. The best way to 
find those agencies is to contact the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) “subsidized counseling and referral line” at 800-569-4287. 
Simply enter your five-digit zip code and select the “default, foreclosure, and 
mortgage delinquency counseling” option to obtain the name and phone 
number of an approved counseling agency near you.

210
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Alternatively, you can visit the HUD Web site (www.hud.gov) and then click 
on the link for your state. In addition to helpful articles, the Web site enables 
you to find multiple area counseling agencies (the automated phone referral 
service provides the contact information only of the one agency that’s closest 
to you).
Negotiate with Your Lender
Smart lenders don’t want your property to end up in foreclosure, especially 
if the mortgage balance exceeds what the lender could reasonably expect to 
net (after selling and other expenses) from selling the property. If your current 
mortgage terms appear to doom you to foreclosure, contact your lender 
immediately and plead your case to have your loan modified.
 
For ideas on how to customize your current loan terms to help you afford 
your home, consult with a local HUD-approved counselor, as discussed in 
the previous section. Most lenders can make your current loan more attrac-
tive (by reducing the interest rate or changing the rate to a fixed-rate from an 
adjustable, for example) if doing so will keep you out of foreclosure and keep 
you making monthly payments.
Understand Bankruptcy
To make the best decision that you can, consider a range of options. When 
mortgage and other debt prove overwhelming, bankruptcy is one option you 
should explore and better understand.
The biggest challenge with considering bankruptcy is finding unbiased sources 
of information and advice. Some supposed counselors won’t discuss or recom-
mend it to you; others, such as bankruptcy attorneys, often have a bias at the 
other end of the spectrum. The HUD-approved counselors recommended 
earlier in this chapter are a good starting point.
Consider the Future Impact 
to Your Credit Report
Folks who make little if any effort to find a solution to their housing debt woes 
and who choose to walk away from a property that’s proven to be a loss from 
an investment perspective often suffer consequences down the road. Before 
taking this step, think a moment about the long-term consequences. If you 

211
 Chapter 13: Ten (Or So) “Must-Knows” about Foreclosures 
were a lender, how motivated would you be to lend money to someone who 
threw in the towel without working to find a solution? And if you did lend 
such a person money, would you give him or her the best loan rates and 
terms that you give folks with excellent credit histories?
 
Roll up your sleeves and work with your lender and talk with counselors to find 
a solution that will enable you to keep your property. Your credit report may still 
suffer damage but you can minimize the fallout both now and in the future.
Understand the Realities of Investing
in Foreclosed Property
You may be considering purchasing a property that’s in some stage of fore-
closure. Although earning handsome returns on investing in foreclosed property 
is an option, make sure you know what you’re getting into. Doing so isn’t as easy 
as some real estate investing cheerleaders may lead you to think.
Often, property that ends up in foreclosure has some problems. So, if you rush 
to buy without thoroughly inspecting a property inside and out, you could end 
up with more trouble and costs than you expected.
Investing in foreclosures is for sophisticated, experienced investors. Finding 
and buying a good property at an attractive price takes a lot of homework and 
patience. Please see the latest edition of Real Estate Investing For Dummies by 
Eric Tyson and Robert Griswold (Wiley) for more details.

Don’t Let Lenders Tell You 
What You Can Afford
Unless you’re richer than Midas, you could inadvertently overextend yourself 
when you get a mortgage. How? By taking on more debt than you can com-
fortably handle. Just because a lender says that you qualify for a certain loan 
amount doesn’t mean that you should blithely bound into debt for that much 
money. Don’t commit to a mortgage larger than you can comfortably afford. 
This lesson was painfully apparent in the late 2000s, thanks to a housing slump 
and a sharply higher rate of foreclosures. But even during good economic 

214
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
times and strong housing markets, foreclosures happen and often are the 
result of folks being overextended (see Chapter 13 for more info about 
foreclosures).
Even the best of lenders can’t tell you how much cash you can prudently 
afford to borrow because they don’t know all the nuances of your personal 
financial situation. They can only tell you how big a financial risk they’re will-
ing to take on you.
 
Realistically evaluate your present and future financial goals. Estimate your 
living expenses before and after buying a home. Don’t fudge the numbers 
so they come out the way you want them to. You’ll only hurt yourself if you 
underestimate expenses and overestimate income. Carefully read Chapter 1 
for more help.
Never Confuse Loan Prequalification 
with Preapproval
Why waste weeks or even months of your valuable time looking at property 
you may want to purchase only to belatedly discover that no lending institution 
other than a pawnshop will give you a loan? Instead of rushing out to gawk at 
property, smart folks start the home-buying process by determining whether 
lenders consider them creditworthy.
Getting prequalified for a mortgage isn’t tough. Heck, even bankrupt arsonists 
can get themselves prequalified. And therein lies the problem. As we note in 
Chapter 2, loan prequalification entails nothing more than a perfunctory perusal 
of your finances. In terms of overall effectiveness, it ranks with attempting to 
raise the water level of the Pacific Ocean by melting the ice cubes from your 
freezer in it.
Loan preapproval, conversely, is extremely thorough. With your permission, a 
lender independently verifies financial facts such as your income and expenses, 
your assets and liabilities, the amount of cash you have for a down payment, and 
your credit history. If you pass the lender’s inspection, you get a letter stating 
that you’ve been preapproved for a mortgage — the next best thing to having a 
line of credit at your disposal. You know how much you can borrow.
There’s another excellent reason to get preapproved: Credit reports sometimes 
contain inaccurate information. Left uncorrected, that misinformation may 
adversely affect a borrower’s credit score and make it difficult to qualify 
for the lowest possible interest rate. If you find errors on your credit report 
during the preapproval process, you have time to correct them before they 
cost you money. See Chapter 3 for the details on credit reports.

215
 Chapter 14: Ten Mortgage No-Nos
 
You also have a delightful advantage over buyers who haven’t been preapproved 
for a loan if you find yourself in a multiple-offer situation. Because those other 
people never bothered to authenticate their creditworthiness, the sellers don’t 
know whether they’re serious buyers or just tire kickers. You, on the other hand, 
have written verification that you’re a financially qualified buyer. As a result, 
your offer will be given the attention and respect it so richly deserves.
Avoid Loans with Prepayment Penalties
Suppose that you loaned a couple of pals $2,500. They faithfully promised 
they’d repay you in a year. So you were overjoyed when you got the money 
back in six months.
Sad to say, that’s not the reaction of certain mortgage lenders. Believe it or 
not, if your loan has a prepayment penalty, lenders have the right to charge you 
thousands of dollars for repaying your mortgage before it’s due.
Chapter 4 explains how to determine whether the lender can impose a prepay-
ment penalty on a loan you’re considering. Don’t despair if your present mort-
gage happens to have a prepayment penalty. As we explain in Chapter 4, you 
may be able to prepay some of the outstanding loan balance without penalty as 
long as you time the payments correctly or keep your payments under a previ-
ously specified amount of money, usually 20 percent of the loan amount.
Don’t Reflexively Grab 
a Fixed-Rate Mortgage
FRM, ARM, GPM, IOU. The alphabet soup of loans sloshing around in today’s 
financial market would give anyone a mortgage migraine. No matter how com-
plicated they sound, all these loans fall into one of two basic classifications — 
fixed rate or adjustable rate. At times, a fixed-rate loan is decidedly better than 
an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and vice versa.
Some people, however, opt for fixed-rate mortgages because these mortgages 
have been around longer than adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and because, 
compared to ARMs, fixed-rate loans are easier to understand. Unfortunately, 
that means some people are using the wrong criteria to select their 
mortgages.

216
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Chapter 5 shows how to use the answers to three simple questions to decide 
whether a fixed-rate mortgage or an ARM is the right loan for you. You’ll dis-
cover that everything boils down to determining how long you plan to keep 
the loan, how much financial risk you can accept, and how much money you 
want to borrow.
 
If you intend to keep your loan three to ten years, your best financing option 
is probably a hybrid loan of five to ten years, which combines the stability of 
a fixed-rate mortgage with the lower initial interest rate of an ARM. Most folks 
don’t even know such a loan exists. Now you do.
Steer Clear of Toxic 100-Percent
Home Equity Loans
Equity is the difference between what your property is worth in today’s market 
and how much you currently owe on it. Suppose, for example, that your house 
was just appraised for $200,000, and your outstanding loan balance is $120,000. 
You have $80,000 of equity in your home. Isn’t it great to be a homeowner?
You can use a home equity loan, which we discuss in Chapter 6, to free up 
some of that equity for other purposes. Home equity loans can be excellent 
financial tools when used prudently.
Used imprudently, however, home equity loans are a fast track to ruination. 
The most shocking example of this is an equity loan for 100 percent (or more, 
we kid you not) of your home’s value. (Before the housing market downturn 
of the late 2000s scared lenders and regulators silly, we were appalled to see 
125-percent home equity loans.)
Homeowners typically get a 100-percent home equity loan to relieve the 
oppressive burden of high monthly payments on their credit card debt. After 
getting a 100-percent home equity loan, however, many of these folks blithely 
run up more credit card bills and eventually find themselves even deeper in 
the credit abyss.
 
Getting a 100-percent home equity loan to consolidate credit card debt isn’t a 
panacea. If you simply stretch out repayment of debt instead of addressing the 
underlying problem of credit mismanagement, you’ll ultimately pay even more 
in total interest charges. Worse yet, you’ll convert unsecured credit card debt 
into mortgage debt. That puts your home in jeopardy of foreclosure if you fail 
to make the scheduled monthly loan payments.

217
 Chapter 14: Ten Mortgage No-Nos
Watch Out for Mortgage Brokers
with Hidden Agendas
Early on in your quest for the elusive best mortgage, you’ll have to decide 
whether you’d rather shop for a loan yourself by contacting lenders directly 
or use a mortgage broker to shop for you. Mortgage brokers don’t lend their 
own money. They act as intermediaries for direct lenders such as banks and 
mortgage brokers that ultimately provide the funds for your mortgage.
Thousands of lenders out there would love to help you get financing. Many 
of them are mediocre, a few are good, and an even smaller number are great. 
Chapter 7 is filled with techniques you can use to isolate the best from the rest.
 
If your broker wants you to get a risky mortgage, such as a balloon loan (see 
Chapter 6) or a negative amortization ARM (covered next), watch out. The 
mortgage broker may be sacrificing your best interests to get a bigger com-
mission. Good mortgage brokers concentrate on finding the best loan for you 
rather than generating the largest possible commission for themselves.
Shun Negative Amortization Mortgages
Good adjustable-rate mortgages, as we note in Chapter 5, adjust both the 
interest rate and the monthly loan payment at exactly the same time. Avoid 
ARMs that either change the loan’s interest rate more frequently than the 
monthly payment or that limit how much the monthly loan payment can 
increase without similarly limiting interest rate increases. Either scenario can 
lead to negative amortization, a dreadful situation in which your loan balance 
gets larger rather than smaller each month.
Negative amortization occurs whenever your monthly loan payment is too 
small to pay all of the loan’s monthly interest charges. The unpaid portion of 
interest is added to your loan balance. Every month that you have negative 
amortization, your loan grows larger by the amount of unpaid interest plus 
interest charges on your previous unpaid interest.
 
Negative amortization has the potential to be a personal financial neutron 
bomb. It destroys the borrower without harming the property. If you’re 
offered an ARM with negative amortization, emphatically say, “NO!”

218
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Don’t Let the 2-Percent Rule 
Bully You When Refinancing
You may be advised by a well-intentioned friend that there absolutely, positively, 
without fail, must be at least a 2 percentage point differential between your pres-
ent mortgage’s interest rate and the new loan’s rate before refinancing makes 
economic sense. The 2-percent rule is nothing more than a quick way to 
determine how fast you’ll recover the cost of refinancing.
With a 2-percentage-point spread between your old loan’s interest rate and 
the new mortgage rate, you’ll most likely recover all your refinancing costs 
in less than two years. However, if you don’t intend to sell your home within 
the next few years, an interest rate differential smaller than 2 percent is fine. 
Getting your refinancing costs back will just take you a little longer. If mortgage 
rates have dropped since you bought your home, you owe it to yourself to at 
least investigate the economics of refinancing. For more information, please 
see Chapter 11.
Don’t Assume That All Reverse 
Mortgages Are the Same or Bad
Homeowners 62 years of age or older can convert a portion of their home’s 
equity into cash without having to sell the property or repay a loan each month. 
Eligibility for these home equity conversion programs is based upon such things 
as your age, your home’s value, and the amount of your existing mortgage debt. 
You won’t be disqualified, however, if you don’t have enough income. On the 
contrary, many home equity conversion programs are specifically intended for 
low-to-moderate income folks.
These unusual loan programs are referred to as reverse mortgages, because 
they operate like a standard mortgage in reverse. Instead of borrowing a lump 
sum of money that you have to repay monthly, the lender sends you monthly 
payments. Each monthly payment you get converts some of your home’s 
equity into cash.
 
Reverse mortgages offer eligible homeowners a source of retirement cash. 
But what you don’t know about reverse mortgages can cost you big bucks. 
For instance, you may be able to get considerably more cash from one pro-
gram than another. Worse yet, the true cost of various reverse mortgage 
programs differs significantly from lender to lender — and even among an 

219
 Chapter 14: Ten Mortgage No-Nos
assortment of programs offered by the same lender. Proceed with extreme 
caution. That said, don’t incorrectly assume that a reverse mortgage lender 
can boot you out of your home against your will.
Avoid Mortgage Life Insurance
Soon after moving into your new home or refinancing your mortgage, you’ll 
get several million junk mail solicitations for optional mortgage life insurance 
policies ghoulishly offering to pay off your loan if you kick the bucket. We 
strongly urge you not to purchase either mortgage life insurance or mortgage 
disability insurance. There’s no correlation between your loan amount and 
how much life or disability insurance you need to protect your dependents. 
What’s more, these policies tend to be grossly overpriced for the amount of 
insurance they offer.
 
Shop for insurance wisely. Low-cost, high-quality term life insurance and long-
term disability insurance are far better solutions to fill the gaps in your 
insurance coverage.

Ten Issues to Consider Before 
Prepaying Your Loan
In This Chapter
 Saving interest dollars
 Deciding what type of investor you are
A
fter you go to all the time, trouble, and expense of securing a mortgage, 
you may have a hard time imagining that you’d ever want to pay off your 
loan quicker than required. However, years (and sometimes just months) after 
taking out a mortgage, some people discover that their circumstances have 
changed.
Perhaps your income has increased nicely of late, or you’re the recipient of 
an inheritance. Maybe you’re one of those rare folks who succeed in spending less, 
thus freeing up more of your monthly income for other purposes. No matter — if 
you have some extra cash leftover at the end of each month, this chapter can 
help you decide whether you should use that money to pay down your out-
standing mortgage balance faster than necessary.
Different Strokes for Different Folks
If you speak with others or read articles or books about prepaying your mortgage, 
you’ll come across those who think that prepaying your mortgage is the world’s 
greatest money-saving device. You’ll also find that some people consider it the 
most colossal mistake a mortgage holder can make. The reality, as you see as you 
read this chapter, is often somewhere between these two extremes.
Everyone has pros and cons to weigh when they decide whether prepaying 
their mortgage makes sense for them. In some cases, the pros stand head and 
shoulders over the cons. For other people, the drawbacks to prepaying tower 
over the advantages.

222
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Yes, You Do Save Interest . . .
Prepayment advocates focus on how much interest you won’t be charged. 
On a $100,000, 30-year mortgage, at 7.5-percent interest, if you pay just an 
extra $100 of principal per month, you shorten the loan’s term significantly. 
Prepayment cheerleaders argue that you’ll save approximately $56,000 over 
the life of the loan.
It’s true that by making larger-than-required payments each month, you 
avoid paying some interest to the lender. In the preceding example, in fact, 
you’ll pay off your loan nearly ten years faster than required.
However, You Miss the Opportunity to 
Invest Those Extra Payments . . .
When you mail an additional $100 monthly to your lender, you miss the 
opportunity to invest that money into something that could provide you with 
a return greater than the cost of the mortgage interest. Have you heard of the 
stock market, for example?
Over the past two centuries, the U.S. stock market has produced an annual 
rate of return of close to 9 to 10 percent. Thus, if instead of prepaying your 
mortgage, you put that $100 into some good stocks and earn 9 to 10 percent 
per year, you end up with more money over the long term than if you had 
prepaid your mortgage (assuming that your mortgage interest rate is below 9 
to 10 percent).
Conversely, if instead of paying down your mortgage more rapidly, you 
put your extra cash in your bank savings account, you earn little interest. 
Because you’re surely paying more interest on your mortgage, you lose 
money with this investment strategy, although you make bankers happy.
 
If you’re contemplating paying down your mortgage more aggressively than 
required or investing your extra cash, consider what rate of return you can 
reasonably expect from investing your money and compare that expected 
return to the interest rate you’re paying on your mortgage. As a first step, this 
simple comparison can help you begin to understand whether you’re better off 
paying down your mortgage or investing the money elsewhere. Over the long-
term, growth investments such as stocks, investment real estate, and investing 
in small business have provided higher returns than the current cost of mort-
gage money.

223
 Chapter 15: Ten Issues to Consider Before Prepaying Your Loan
Taxes Matter, but . . .
Now, you may be thinking that — up until this point in this discussion — we 
haven’t presented all the facts, and you’d be correct in thinking so. One 
important detail we’ve ignored is income tax. (We all wish we could ignore 
paying our income taxes!)
In most cases, all your mortgage interest is tax deductible on both your federal 
and state income tax returns (see the nearby sidebar, “All mortgage interest isn’t 
tax deductible” for exceptions). Thus, if you’re paying, say, a 7.5-percent annual 
interest rate on your mortgage, after deducting that interest cost on your federal 
and state income tax returns, perhaps the mortgage is really costing you only 
about 5 percent on an after-tax basis. For most people, approximately one-third 
of the total interest cost of a mortgage is erased by tax reduction from writing off 
the mortgage interest on their federal and state income tax returns.
However, don’t think that you can compare this relatively low after-tax mortgage 
cost of, say, 5 percent to the expected return on most investments. The return 
on most investments, such as stocks, is ultimately taxable. So, to be fair, if you’re 
going to examine the after-tax cost of your mortgage, you should be comparing 
that with the after-tax return on your investments.
All mortgage interest isn’t tax deductible
If you’re a high-income earner, are subject to 
the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), 
or have low levels of itemized deductions, be 
warned that some of the itemized deductions 
from your mortgage interest may not effectively 
be tax deductible and may result in less tax sav-
ings than you think. For tax year 2008, if your 
adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $159,950 
(for married as well as single taxpayers), you 
lose some of your Schedule A itemized deduc-
tions (which includes mortgage interest).
Also, be aware of the following standard deduc-
tions: $10,900 for married couples and $5,450 for 
singles for tax year 2008. Ignoring your mortgage 
interest deductions, if your itemized deductions 
total less than these threshold amounts, some 
of your mortgage interest is effectively not tax 
deductible. For example, if you’re married and 
your itemized deductions, excluding mortgage 
interest, total to $8,000, then $2,900 of the mort-
gage interest you pay is essentially not tax 
deductible because you automatically qualify 
for the standard $10,900 deduction if you elect 
not to itemize.
Last but not least, IRS tax laws limit the amount 
of mortgage interest on your primary and a 
secondary residence that’s tax deductible to 
no more than the interest on up to $1 million of 
mortgage debt. Also, the interest is allowed to 
be deducted only on debt equal to the amount 
you borrowed when you originally bought your 
home plus $100,000.

224
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Alternatively, you could simplify matters for yourself and compare the pretax 
mortgage cost to your expected pretax investment return. (Technically speaking, 
this comparison isn’t as precise because taxes generally don’t exactly equally 
reduce the cost of the mortgage and the investment return.)
Fund Your Retirement Savings Plan(s)
If you have extra cash each month and you’re debating the merits of paying 
down your mortgage versus investing the cash elsewhere, be sure that you’ve 
fully contributed to retirement accounts. Through your employer, you may 
have access to a plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b). If you’re self-employed, you 
could fund a Keogh or SEP-IRA. In all these plans, your contributions are effec-
tively tax deductible, usually at both the federal and state levels.
By contrast, if you make extra payments on your mortgage, you get no tax 
relief from so doing. Thus, if you haven’t fully funded tax-deductible retire-
ment plans, do so before paying down your mortgage debt (unless, of course, 
you’re going to leave the retirement money dozing away in a low-return 
investment such as a savings account or money market fund).
Look to See Whether Your Mortgage 
Has a Prepayment Penalty
An important issue to clarify is to find out whether your current mortgage 
has a prepayment penalty (it shouldn’t if you read and follow our sage advice 
in Chapter 4 before obtaining your mortgage). If your mortgage does have 
a prepayment penalty, it could negate some or all of your expected interest 
savings from paying down your mortgage early.
Just because a mortgage has a prepayment penalty doesn’t mean that you 
shouldn’t examine the possibility of prepaying it. In fact, when you investigate 
the prepayment terms on your mortgage, you may well find that you can prepay 
a significant amount of the outstanding balance (such as 20 percent per year) 
without being hit with a prepayment penalty.

225
 Chapter 15: Ten Issues to Consider Before Prepaying Your Loan
Identify Whether You’re an Aggressive
or Conservative Investor
Miriam and Bert were in their early 60s when they called upon Eric for some 
financial counseling. Over the years, they had accumulated about $50,000, 
which they had in a money market account. They knew that they didn’t want 
to leave the money there, but they didn’t know what to do with it.
Reviewing Miriam’s and Bert’s investments and discussing their investment 
likes and dislikes, Eric discerned that this couple was financially conservative 
and especially so about their impending retirement. They had their portfolio 
about equally split between stocks and bonds and weren’t comfortable taking 
more risk.
Their outstanding mortgage balance of $32,000 was at 8-percent interest. 
Eric suggested that they use their cash to pay off their mortgage. He rea-
soned that if instead of paying the mortgage they invested half the money 
in stocks and half in bonds, their longer-term expected return would likely 
be no more than 8 percent — the cost of the mortgage. Why take the risk of 
investing, which Miriam and Bert didn’t enjoy doing, in the hopes of getting 
an 8-percent return, when paying off the mortgage and saving the 8-percent 
interest was a sure thing?
By contrast, Phil was an aggressive 30-something investor when he consulted 
Eric. He invested his new savings into nearly all stocks, so he expected to be 
making a high enough return to beat the interest cost on his mortgage. Also, 
Phil likened paying down his mortgage to watching the grass grow — not 
very rewarding or exciting.
Focus on the Psychological 
and Nonfinancial Benefits
Many of the issues we suggest considering when you decide whether or not 
to pay down your mortgage balance faster are purely financial. However, we 
don’t want to diminish or overlook the importance of the touchy-feely issues.

226
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Specifically, would you derive any solace from paying your balance down or 
completely off? Miriam (whom we discuss in the preceding section) said, “I 
felt a tremendous sense of relief when we paid off our mortgage. Bert [my 
husband] thought doing so wasn’t real exciting, but I feel better knowing that 
we don’t owe any more money.”
Another of Eric’s clients, Kevin, chose to pay his mortgage off at the relatively 
young age of 35. “While I could have kept my mortgage going, paying it off com-
pletely freed me psychologically from feeling like I had to keep working as hard 
as my peers did at their careers. Now that I have a family, spending time with 
them is my first priority, not climbing career ladders.”
Know How Liquid You Are
If you’re considering paying down mortgage debt, don’t leave yourself cash poor 
(lack of liquidity). As a homeowner, you’re probably already painfully aware 
of your home’s tendency to need fixing up and maintenance over the years. 
Suppose your roof needs replacing and you don’t have the cash to pay for it? Or 
what if you lose your job and finding a suitable new one takes a few months?
You should have access to an emergency source of readily available funds, 
such as in a money market fund, of at least three to six months’ worth of 
living expenses. Otherwise, when unexpected expenses come up, you’ll have 
to go into hock on high interest (and not tax-deductible) credit cards.
Take a Closer Look at Refinancing
Don’t forget the option of refinancing into a better mortgage. Mary had an 
8.5-percent, fixed-rate mortgage and was leaning toward paying it down 
instead of investing her spare cash in mutual funds.
Then she found out that her loan amount was just above the conforming loan 
limit (see Chapter 4). If she reduced the amount she borrowed by just $10,000, 
she would qualify for a lower interest rate on a conforming loan. She also saved 
by refinancing at rates that were lower than her original loan.
Her new loan was at 7 percent. At that rate, she felt that she could earn a 
higher return investing her money, so not paying off her mortgage faster 
than necessary made sense to her. Ask your lender for a written explanation 
before you prepay your loan.

n this part, we give you tables — no, not like that 
ketchup-splattered wooden thing in a family restau-

promise that they’ll help you in your evaluation of loan

We present loan amortization tables and remaining bal-

giving you a headache, we provide a handy glossary of 
mortgage terms.

Appendix A
Loan Amortization Table

n Chapter 3, we discuss the four basic components of loans:
 
 Principal: Money you borrow
 
 Interest: Percentage lenders charge you to use their money
 
 Term: Amount of time before your loan comes due
 
 Amortization: Loan payments comprised of principal and interest
By using the nifty tables in this appendix, you can estimate mortgage payments 
for the most frequently used loan terms ranging from 5 to 30 years and interest 
rates covering the spectrum from a lusciously low 3 percent all the way up to 
18 percent. The amounts shown in these tables indicate how much you’d pay 
each month to fully repay a $100,000 loan by the end of the indicated term. You 
can, however, use the tables to calculate the monthly payment for any loan 
amount by using the following formula:
Monthly loan payment = your loan amount × payment shown in the table
 
$100,000
Example #1: If you get a $250,000, 30-year mortgage at 8.25-percent interest, 
your monthly principal and interest payment will be:
$250,000 × $751.27 = $1,878.18/mo.
$100,000
Example #2: If you get a $60,000, 20-year mortgage at 12-percent interest, 
your monthly principal and interest payment will be:
$60,000 × $1,101.09 = $660.65/mo.
$100,000

Par t VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Remaining Balance Tables
T
he tables in Appendix A help you figure out how much you’d need to pay 
each month to amortize (repay) a mortgage. The tables in this appendix, 
conversely, show how much of your loan remains unpaid as the mortgage is 
amortized.
A remaining principal balance is shown as a percentage of the original mort-
gage amount. For example, the number 23.58 indicates that 23.58 percent of 
the money you originally borrowed still remains to be paid. Remaining bal-
ance tables are wonderfully straightforward. Here’s how to use them:
 
1. Find the table that matches your loan’s interest rate.
 
2. Locate the column on that table for your loan’s original term.
 
3. Read down the loan term column until you find the remaining balance 
percentage for your loan’s approximate age as noted by the “# of 
years paid on loan” column on the left side of the table.
 
4. Multiply your original loan amount by that percentage to get the esti-
mated remaining loan balance.
 
If you absolutely must know the precise remaining balance to the penny, 
ask your friendly lender.
Example #1: If you obtained a $250,000, 30-year mortgage at 8.25-percent 
interest 15 years ago, your estimated remaining principal balance is $250,000 
× 77.44% = $193,600. You may find this astonishing because you’re halfway 
through the loan’s 30-year term. As you can see by glancing down the term 
column, most of your payment consists of interest during the mortgage’s 
early years. At 8.25-percent interest, for example, you pay off only 0.8 percent 
of principal in the loan’s first year. You’ll take more than 20 years to repay 
half of the original loan balance — and well under 10 years to pay off the 
other half, because more of your monthly payment is principal and less is 
interest as time goes by.
Example #2: If you obtained a $60,000, 20-year mortgage at 12-percent inter-
est 5 years ago, your estimated remaining principal balance is $60,000 × 
91.74% = $55,044.

Appendix C
Glossary
“The difference between the almost-right word and the right word is really 
a large matter — it’s the difference between the lightning bug and the 
lightning.”
—Mark Twain
T
erms that appear in italics within the definitions are defined elsewhere in 
this glossary.
acceleration clause: A mortgage contract provision that gives the lender 
the right to demand payment of the entire outstanding balance if you miss a 
monthly payment, sell the property, or otherwise fail to perform as promised 
under the terms of your mortgage. (See also due-on-sale clause.)
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): A mortgage whose interest rate and monthly 
payments vary throughout its life. ARMs typically start with an unusually low 
interest rate (see teaser rate) that gradually rises over time. If the overall level 
of interest rates drops, as measured by a variety of different indexes (see 
index), the interest rate of an ARM generally follows suit. Similarly, if inter-
est rates rise, so does a mortgage’s interest rate and monthly payment. The 
amount that the interest can fluctuate is limited by caps (see periodic cap and 
life cap). Before you agree to an adjustable-rate mortgage, be sure that you 
can afford the highest payments that would result if the interest rate on your 
mortgage increased to the maximum allowed.
adjustment period or adjustment frequency: How often the interest rate for 
an adjustable-rate mortgage changes. Some adjustable-rate mortgages change 
every month, but one or two adjustments per year is more typical. The less 
frequently your loan rate shifts, the less financial uncertainty you may have. 
But if you opt for less frequent adjustments in your mortgage rate, you’ll 
probably have a higher teaser rate or initial interest rate. (The initial interest 
rate is also called the “start rate.”)
amortization: Lender jargon for the process of gradually paying down a debt, 
usually by making monthly payments throughout the loan’s term. In the early 
years of a mortgage, most of the monthly payment goes toward payment of 
interest and little toward reducing the loan balance.

262
Par t VI: Appendixes 
annual percentage rate (APR): A figure that states the total yearly cost of a 
mortgage as expressed by the actual rate of interest paid. The APR includes 
the base interest rate, points, and any other add-on loan fees and costs. As a 
result, the APR is invariably higher than the rate of interest that the lender 
quotes for the mortgage but gives a more accurate picture of the likely cost 
of the loan. Keep in mind, however, that most mortgages aren’t held for their 
full 15- or 30-year terms, so the effective annual percentage rate is higher 
than the quoted APR because the points and loan fees are spread out over 
fewer years.
annuity: A monthly cash advance for life from an insurance company.
appraisal: A professional opinion about the market value of the house you 
want to buy (or already own if you’re refinancing your loan). You must pay 
for the mortgage lender to hire an appraiser, because this opinion helps pro-
tect the lender from lending you money on a home that’s not worth enough 
(in the event that you default on the loan and the lender must foreclose on the 
property). For typical homes, the appraisal fee is several hundred dollars.
appreciation: The increase of a property’s value.
ARM indexes: See certificates of deposit, treasury bills, the 11th District Cost of 
Funds Index (COFI), and The London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR).
assessed value: The value of a property (according to the local county tax 
assessor) for the purpose of determining property taxes.
assumable mortgage: Allows future buyers of a home to take over the 
remaining loan balance of a mortgage. If you need to sell your house but 
interest rates are high, having an assumable mortgage may be handy. You 
may be able to offer the buyer your assumable loan at a lower interest rate 
than the current going interest rate. Assumable, fixed-rate mortgages are vir-
tually extinct these days because lenders realize that they lose a great deal 
of money on these types of mortgages when interest rates skyrocket. Some 
adjustable-rate mortgages are assumable.
balloon loans: Loans that require level payments, just as a 15- or 30-year, 
fixed-rate mortgage does, but well before their maturity date (typically three to 
ten years after the start date), the full remaining balance of the loan becomes 
due and payable. Although balloon loans can save you money because they 
charge a lower rate of interest relative to fixed-rate loans, balloon loans are 
dangerous. Being able to refinance a loan is never a sure thing. Thus, we’re 
not fans of balloon loans.
bridge loan: A loan that enables you to borrow against the equity that is tied 
up in your old home until it sells. These loans can help if you find yourself in 
the generally inadvisable situation of having to close on a new home before 
you have sold your old one. Bridge loans are expensive compared to other 

263
  Appendix C: Glossary
alternatives, such as using a cash reserve, borrowing from family, or using the 
proceeds from the sale of your current home. In most cases, you need the 
bridge loan for only a few months in order to tide you over until you sell your 
house. Thus, the loan fees can represent a high cost (about 10 percent of the 
loan amount) for such a short-term loan.
cap: One of two different types of limits for adjustable-rate mortgages. The life 
cap limits the highest or lowest interest rate that is allowed over the entire life 
of a mortgage. The periodic cap limits the amount that an interest rate can 
change in one adjustment period. A one-year ARM, for example, may have a 
start rate of 5 percent with a plus or minus 2-percent periodic adjustment cap 
and a 6-percent life cap. On a worst-case basis, the loan’s interest rate would 
be 7 percent in the second year, 9 percent in the third year, and 11 percent 
(5-percent start rate plus the 6-percent life cap) forevermore, starting with 
the fourth year.
cash reserve: A sufficient amount of cash left over after closing on a mort-
gage loan to make the first two mortgage payments or to cover a financial 
emergency. This amount is required by most mortgage lenders. If you’re a 
seller who’s thinking of extending credit to buyers, you’d also be wise to 
insist that they have adequate cash reserves.
certificates of deposit (CDs): An interest-bearing bank investment that locks 
an investor in for a specific period of time. Adjustable-rate mortgages are 
sometimes tied (indexed) to the average interest rate banks are paying on 
certificates of deposit (CDs). CDs tend to move rapidly with overall changes 
in interest rates. However, CD rates tend to move up a bit more slowly when 
rates rise, because profit-minded bankers take their sweet time to pay more 
interest to depositors. Conversely, CD rates tend to come down quickly when 
rates decline so that bankers can maintain their profits.
closing costs: Costs that generally total from 2 to 5 percent of a home’s pur-
chase price and are completely independent of (and in addition to) the down 
payment. Closing costs include such expenses as points (also called the loan 
origination fee), an appraisal fee, a credit report fee, mortgage interest for the 
period between the closing date and the first loan payment, homeowners 
insurance premium, title insurance, prorated property tax, and recording and 
transferring charges. When you’re finally ready to buy your dream home, 
don’t forget that you must have enough cash to pay all these costs in order 
to complete the purchase.
condominiums: Housing units contained within a larger development area in 
which residents own their actual units and a share of everything else in the 
development (lobby, parking areas, land, and the like, which are known as 
common areas).

264
Par t VI: Appendixes 
conforming loans: Mortgages that fall within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s 
loan limits. If you borrow less than this amount, you’ll get a lower interest 
rate than on so-called nonconforming or jumbo loans.
contingencies: Conditions contained in almost all home-purchase offers. 
Sellers or buyers must meet or waive all their respective contingencies before 
the deal can be closed. These conditions are related to such factors as the 
buyer’s review and approval of property inspections or the buyer’s ability to 
obtain the mortgage financing specified in the contract. If you’re a homebuyer, 
make absolutely certain that your offer contains a loan contingency.
convertible adjustable-rate mortgages: Loans that (unlike conventional 
adjustable-rate mortgages) give you the opportunity to convert to a fixed-rate 
mortgage, usually between the 13th and 60th month of the loan. For this privi-
lege, convertible adjustable-rate mortgage loans have a higher rate of interest 
than conventional adjustable-rate mortgages, and a conversion fee (which 
can range from a few hundred dollars to 1 percent or so of the remaining 
loan balance) is charged. Additionally, if you choose to convert your ARM to 
a fixed-rate mortgage, you’ll probably pay a slightly higher rate than you can 
get by shopping around for the best rates available at the time you convert.
cooperatives (co-ops): Apartment buildings where residents own a share of a 
corporation whose main asset is the building they live in. Cooperative apart-
ments are generally harder to finance and harder to sell than condominiums.
cosigner: A friend or relative who comes to a borrower’s rescue by cosigning 
(which literally means being indebted for) a mortgage. If you have a check-
ered past in the credit world, you may need help securing a mortgage, even 
though you’re currently financially stable. A cosigner can’t improve your 
credit report but can improve your chances of getting a mortgage. Cosigners 
should be aware, however, that cosigning for your loan will adversely affect 
their future creditworthiness, because your loan becomes what is known as a 
contingent liability against their borrowing power.
credit line: A credit account that permits a reverse mortgage borrower to control 
the timing and amount of the loan advances (also known as a “line of credit”).
credit report: A report that documents your history of repaying debt. It’s the 
main report lenders utilize to determine your creditworthiness. You must 
pay for this report, which is used to determine your ability to handle all 
forms of credit and to pay off loans in a timely fashion. If you’re a seller who’s 
providing financing for buyers, get their permission to obtain a credit report 
on them.
debt-to-income ratio: Measures your future monthly housing expenses, 
which include your proposed mortgage payment (debt), property tax, and 
insurance in relation to your monthly income. Mortgage lenders generally 
figure that you shouldn’t spend more than about 40 percent of your monthly 
income on housing costs.

265
  Appendix C: Glossary
deed: The document that conveys title to real property. Before you receive 
the deed to your new home, the escrow holder must receive the payoff for the 
old loan on the property, your new mortgage financing, and your payments 
for the down payment and closing costs. The title insurance company must 
also show that the seller holds clear and legal title to the property for which 
title is being conveyed.
deed in lieu of foreclosure: Instead of foreclosure, which is generally costly 
and time consuming for all parties, a deed in lieu of foreclosure is a volun-
tarily entered agreement whereby the borrower conveys ownership of the 
property in default to the lender to satisfy outstanding debt on that property.
deed of trust: A security instrument that transfers title to property to a third 
person (the trustee) as a guarantee you’ll repay a debt. Like a mortgage, a 
deed of trust makes real property security for money you borrow.
default: Status that is most often caused by failure to make monthly mort-
gage payments on time. You’re officially in default when you’ve missed two 
or more monthly payments. Default also refers to other violations of mort-
gage terms such as trying to pass your loan on to another buyer when the 
property is sold, which triggers the loan’s due-on-sale clause. Default can lead 
to foreclosure on your house.
delinquency: Status that occurs when the mortgage lender doesn’t receive a 
monthly mortgage payment by the due date. At first a borrower is delinquent; 
then he or she is in default.
depreciation: Decrease in a property’s value (the reverse of appreciation).
down payment: The part of the purchase price that the buyer pays in cash, 
up front, and does not finance with a mortgage. Generally, the larger the 
down payment, the better the deal that you can get on a mortgage. You can 
usually qualify for the best available mortgage programs with a down pay-
ment of 20 percent of the property’s value.
due-on-sale clause: A mortgage clause that entitles the lender to demand full 
payment of all money due on a loan when the borrower sells or transfers title 
to the property.
earthquake insurance: Either an earthquake insurance rider on a hom-
eowners policy or a separate policy that pays to repair or rebuild a home if 
it’s damaged in an earthquake. Some lenders insist that borrowers obtain 
earthquake insurance. Even if your mortgage lender doesn’t, we strongly rec-
ommend that you get earthquake insurance if you live in an area with earth-
quake risk.

266
Par t VI: Appendixes 
11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI): An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
index that tracks the weighted average cost of savings, borrowings, and 
advances for Federal Home Loan Bank Board member banks located in 
California, Arizona, and Nevada (the 11th District). Because the COFI is a 
moving average of interest rates that bankers have paid depositors over 
recent months, it tends to be a relatively stable, slower moving ARM index.
encumbrance: A right or interest someone else holds in a homeowner’s prop-
erty that affects its title or limits its use. A mortgage, for example, is a money 
encumbrance that affects a home’s title by making it security for repayment 
of the loan.
equity: In the real estate world, equity refers to the difference between the 
market value of a home and the amount the borrower owes on it. For example, 
if your home is worth $200,000 and you have an outstanding mortgage of 
$140,000, your equity is $60,000.
escrow: The holding of important documents and money related to the pur-
chase/sale of real estate by a neutral third party (the escrow officer) prior 
to the close of the transaction. After the seller accepts an offer, the buyer 
doesn’t immediately move into the house. A period when contingencies have 
to be met or waived exists. During this period, the escrow service holds the 
down payment and other buyer and seller documents related to the sale. 
“Closing escrow” means that the deal is completed. Among other duties, the 
escrow officer makes sure that the previous mortgage is paid off and the loan 
is funded.
Fannie Mae: See Federal National Mortgage Association.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC): One of the best-known 
institutions in the secondary mortgage market. Also known as Freddie Mac, 
the FHLMC buys mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institu-
tions and, in turn, sells these mortgages to investors. These loan investments 
are considered safe because Freddie Mac buys mortgages only from com-
panies that conform to its stringent mortgage regulations, and Freddie Mac 
guarantees the repayment of principal and interest on the mortgages that it 
sells.
Federal Housing Administration mortgage (FHA): Mortgages that are 
generally targeted to people with low incomes. The main advantage of these 
mortgages is that they require a small down payment (usually 5 percent 
or less of a home’s purchase price). FHA mortgages also offer competitive 
interest rates — typically 0.5 to 1 percent below the interest rates on other 
mortgages. The downside is that, with an FHA mortgage, the buyer must 
purchase mortgage default insurance (see private mortgage insurance).

  Appendix C: Glossary
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA): One of the best-known insti-
tutions in the secondary mortgage market. Also known as Fannie Mae, the 
FNMA buys mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institutions 
and, in turn, sells them to investors. These loan investments are considered 
safe because Fannie Mae buys mortgages only from companies that conform 
to its stringent mortgage regulations, and Fannie Mae guarantees the repay-
ment of principal and interest on the loans that it sells.
fixed-rate mortgage: A mortgage that allows you to lock in an interest rate 
for the entire term (generally 15 or 30 years) of the mortgage. Your mortgage 
payment will be the same amount every month. Compare fixed-rate mortgages 
with adjustable-rate mortgages.
fixed-term reverse mortgage: A reverse mortgage that becomes due and pay-
able on a specific date.
flood insurance: Insurance that homebuyers in federally designated flood 
areas must purchase in order to obtain a mortgage. If there’s even a remote 
chance that your area may flood, having flood insurance is prudent.
foreclosure: The legal process by which a lender takes possession of and 
sells property in an attempt to satisfy mortgage indebtedness. When you default 
on a loan and the lender deems that you’re incapable of making payments, you 
may lose your home to foreclosure. Being in default, however, doesn’t necessar-
ily lead to foreclosure. Some lenders are lenient (and smart enough to realize 
that foreclosure is costly for them). They’ll help you work out a solution if they 
see that you can remedy your problems.
formula: The way to calculate interest rate revisions for adjustable-rate mort-
gages. Add the ARM’s margin to the index to get the adjusted interest rate 
(margin + index = interest rate).
Freddie Mac: See Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
graduated-payment mortgage: A rare loan specifying monthly payments that 
increase by a predetermined formula (for example, a 3-percent increase each 
year for seven years, after which time payments no longer fluctuate).
home equity: The market value of a home minus any debt against it.
home equity conversion: The reverse mortgage process of turning home 
equity into cash without having to sell or rent the home or make regular loan 
repayments.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM): The reverse mortgage program 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

268
Par t VI: Appendixes 
home equity loan: Technical jargon for a type of second mortgage that allows 
you to borrow against the equity in your house. If used wisely, a home equity 
loan can help people pay off high-interest, non-tax-deductible consumer debt 
or meet other short-term needs, such as payments on a remodeling project.
Home Keeper: The reverse mortgage program developed and backed by 
Fannie Mae.
homeowners insurance: A policy that protects what is probably your most 
valuable asset — your home. Mortgage lenders will always require that you 
have this coverage before funding your loan. “Dwelling coverage” covers the 
cost to rebuild a house. The liability insurance portion of this policy protects 
you against accidents that occur on your property. The personal property 
coverage pays to replace your lost worldly possessions.
hybrid loans: Loans that combine features of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate 
mortgages. The initial interest rate for a hybrid loan may be fixed at the same 
rate for the first three to ten years of the loan (as opposed to only 6 to 12 
months for a standard adjustable-rate mortgage); then the interest rate adjusts 
biannually or annually. The longer the interest rate remains the same, the higher 
the initial interest rate will be. These loans are best for people who plan to own 
their house for a short time (fewer than ten years) and who don’t like the volatil-
ity of a typical adjustable-rate mortgage.
index: A measure of the overall level of market interest rates that the lender 
uses as a reference to calculate the specific interest rate on an adjustable-
rate loan. The index plus the margin determines the interest rate on an 
adjustable-rate mortgage. One index used on some mortgages is the six-month 
treasury bill. For example, if the going rate for these treasury bills is 5.5 per-
cent and the margin is 2.5 percent, your interest rate would be 8 percent. 
Other common indexes used are the certificates of deposit index, 11th District 
Cost of Funds index, and LIBOR index.
interest rate: Interest charges generally accrued as a percentage of the 
amount borrowed. The interest rate is usually quoted in percent per year. 
(Interest is the amount lenders charge you to use their money.)
jumbo loans: Mortgages that exceed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac maxi-
mum permissible conforming loan amounts (also called jumbo conforming or 
nonconforming loans). You pay a higher interest rate for nonconformity. The 
higher the loan amount, the more it hurts the lender if you default on your 
loan. Lenders generally require more than the usual 20-percent down on 
jumbo loans.

269
  Appendix C: Glossary
late charge: A lender fee charged if a mortgage payment is received late. Late 
charges can be as much as 5 percent of your mortgage payment, so be sure 
to get your loan payments in on time.
lien: A legal claim against a property for the purpose of securing payment for 
work performed and money owed on account of loans, judgments, or claims. 
Liens are encumbrances that must be paid off before a property can be sold or 
title can transfer to a subsequent buyer. The liens that are a matter of public 
record on a property for sale appear on a property’s preliminary report.
life cap: The limit that determines the maximum amount your adjustable-rate 
mortgage interest rate and monthly payment can fluctuate up or down during 
the duration of the loan. The life cap is different from the periodic cap that 
limits the extent to which your interest rate can change up or down in any 
one adjustment period.
lifetime advances: On a reverse mortgage, fixed monthly loan advances for 
the rest of a borrower’s life.
loan advances: Payments made to a reverse mortgage borrower or to another 
party on behalf of a borrower.
lock-in: A mortgage lender’s written commitment to guarantee a specified 
interest rate to the mortgage borrower provided that the loan is closed within 
a set period of time. The lock-in should specify the number of points to be 
paid at closing. For the privilege of locking in the rate in advance of the clos-
ing of a loan, you may pay a slight interest rate premium.
London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR): An adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) index. It’s an average of the interest rates that major international 
banks charge each other to borrow U.S. dollars in the London money market. 
Relative to other ARM indexes, LIBOR responds rapidly to changes in inter-
est rates. This international interest-rate index is used on some mortgages 
because foreign investors buy American mortgages as investments.
lump sum: A single loan advance at closing of particular reverse mortgage 
loans.
margin: The amount that’s added to the index in order to calculate the inter-
est rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Most loans have margins around 2.5 
percent. Unlike the index (which constantly moves up and down), the margin 
never changes over the life of the loan.
maturity: When a loan becomes due and payable.

270
Par t VI: Appendixes 
mortgage: A word used by lenders to describe a formidable stack of legal 
documents borrowers must sign to get the money they need to refinance or 
buy real property. Ordinary folks of the nonlender variety generally refer to a 
home loan as a mortgage.
mortgage broker: A person who can help you obtain a mortgage. Mortgage 
brokers buy mortgages wholesale from lenders, mark the mortgages up (typi-
cally from 0.5 to 1 percent), and sell them to buyers. A good mortgage broker 
is most helpful for people who don’t want to shop around on their own for a 
mortgage or for people who have blemishes on their credit reports.
mortgage life insurance: Insurance guaranteeing that the lender will receive 
its money in the dismal event that the borrower meets an untimely demise. 
Those who sell this insurance will try to convince you that you need this 
insurance to protect your dependents and loved ones. Don’t waste your 
money — mortgage life insurance is relatively expensive compared to low-
cost, high-quality term life insurance.
negative amortization: Occurs when an outstanding mortgage balance 
increases despite the fact that the borrower is making the required monthly 
payments. Negative amortization occurs with adjustable-rate mortgages that 
cap the increase in the monthly loan payment but don’t cap the interest rate. 
Therefore, the monthly payments don’t cover all the interest that the borrower 
actually owes. We strongly recommend that you avoid loans with this feature.
nonconforming loans: See jumbo loans.
nonrecourse mortgage: A loan in which a lender can use only the value of 
the home as security for repayment of the mortgage in the event of a loan 
default.
origination: The administrative process of setting up a mortgage, including 
the preparation of documents.
origination fee: See points.
periodic cap: The limit on the amount that the interest rate of an adjustable-
rate mortgage can change up or down in one adjustment period. See also cap.
points: Interest charges paid upfront when a borrower closes on a loan. Also 
known as a loan’s origination fee, points are actually a percentage of the 
total loan amount (one point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount). For 
a $100,000 loan, one point costs $1,000. Generally speaking, the more points 
a loan has, the lower its interest rate should be. All the points paid on a pur-
chase mortgage are deductible in the year they’re paid. If you refinance your 
mortgage, however, the points you pay at the time that you refinance must 

271
  Appendix C: Glossary
be amortized (spread out) over the life of the loan. If you get a 30-year mort-
gage when you refinance, for example, you can deduct only one-thirtieth of 
the points on your taxes each year.
preapproval: A process — far more rigorous than prequalification — that 
mortgage lenders use to determine how much money they’d lend you based 
upon a thorough review of your financial situation. Getting a preapproval 
letter strengthens your negotiating position when you’re buying a home, 
because it shows the sellers your seriousness and creditworthiness.
prepayment: The payment of extra principal on a mortgage — in other 
words, making higher than minimum loan payments to pay off a mortgage 
faster than is required by the lender.
prepayment penalty: A fee that discourages borrowers from making addi-
tional payments on their mortgage loan principal in order to pay the loan off 
faster. We highly urge you to avoid mortgages that penalize prepayment.
prequalification: An informal process whereby lenders, based entirely upon 
the information you disclose about your financial situation, provide an opin-
ion about the amount of money you may be able to borrow. This assessment 
is neither binding nor necessarily accurate, because the lenders haven’t veri-
fied any of your financial information.
principal: The amount borrowed for a loan. If you borrow $100,000, your 
principal is $100,000. Each monthly mortgage payment consists of a portion 
of principal that must be repaid plus the interest that the lender is charging 
you for the use of the money. During the early years of your mortgage, your 
loan payment is primarily interest.
private mortgage insurance (PMI): Insurance that protects the lender in 
case a borrower defaults on a mortgage. If your down payment is less than 
20 percent of your home’s purchase price, you’ll likely need to purchase 
private mortgage insurance (also known as “mortgage default insurance”). 
The smaller the down payment, the more likely a homebuyer is to default on 
a loan. Private mortgage insurance can add hundreds of dollars per year to 
your loan costs. After the equity in your property increases to 20 percent, you 
no longer need the insurance. Don’t confuse this insurance with mortgage life 
insurance.
promissory note: This note is the evidence of your debt, an IOU that specifies 
exactly how much money you borrowed as well as the terms and conditions 
under which you promise to repay it.

272
Par t VI: Appendixes 
property tax: Yearly tax (paid by the owner) assessed on a home. Property 
tax annually averages 1 to 2 percent of a home’s value, but property tax rates 
vary widely throughout this great land.
real property: Dirt. Plain old terra firma and any buildings such as homes, 
garages, tool sheds, barns, or other structures permanently attached to the land.
reconveyance: The conveyance back to a property owner of legal title held 
by a trustee according to terms of a deed of trust. A deed of reconveyance is 
usually recorded when the loan has been repaid as constructive proof that 
the debt is satisfied.
refinance: Lending industry jargon for taking out a new mortgage loan (usu-
ally at a lower interest rate) to pay off an existing mortgage (generally at a 
higher interest rate). Refinancing (also called a refi) isn’t automatic, nor 
is refinancing guaranteed. Refinancing can also be an expensive hassle. 
Carefully weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing.
reverse annuity mortgage: A reverse mortgage in which a lump sum is used 
to purchase an annuity.
reverse mortgage: A loan that enables elderly homeowners, who typically 
are low on cash, to tap into their home’s equity without selling their home or 
moving from it. Specifically, a lending institution makes a check out to the 
homeowners each month; the homeowners then use the proceeds any way 
they wish. This money is really a loan against the value of a home. Because 
the money is a loan, it’s tax-free when the homeowners receive it. These 
loans are nonrecourse. The downsides of these loans are that they deplete 
estate equity, the fees and interest rates tend to be on the high side, and some 
require repayment within a certain number of years.
second mortgage: A mortgage that ranks after a first mortgage in priority 
of recording. In the event of a foreclosure, the proceeds from the sale of the 
home are used to pay off the loans in the order in which they were recorded. 
You can have a third (or even a fourth) mortgage, but the further down the 
line the mortgage is, the higher the risk of default — hence, the higher interest 
rate on the mortgage. See also home equity loan.
short sale: Done with a property in default, to keep it from foreclosure. The 
lender agrees to accept the proceeds from selling the property as fully satis-
fying outstanding debt even though the amount of that debt exceeds the sale 
proceeds.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI): A federal government program provid-
ing monthly cash benefits to low-income persons aged 65 and over, blind, or 
disabled.

273
  Appendix C: Glossary
tax deductible: Payments that you may deduct against your federal and state 
taxable income. The interest portion of mortgage payments, loan points, and 
property taxes are tax deductible.
teaser rate: The attractively low interest rate that most adjustable-rate mort-
gages start with. This rate is also known as the initial interest rate. Don’t be 
sucked into a mortgage because it has a low teaser rate. Look at the mort-
gage’s formula (index + margin = interest rate) for a more reliable method of 
estimating the loan’s future interest rate — the interest rate that will apply 
after the loan is “fully indexed.”
tenure advances: Fixed monthly reverse mortgage loan advances for as long 
as a borrower lives in a home.
term: In a mortgage plan, the amount of time (typically 15 or 30 years) a 
lender gives a borrower to repay the loan.
term advances: Fixed monthly reverse mortgage loan advances for a specific 
period of time.
title insurance: Insurance that covers the legal fees and expenses necessary 
to defend your title against claims that may be made against your owner-
ship of the property. The extent of your coverage depends upon whether 
you have an owner’s standard coverage or extended-coverage title insurance 
policy. To get a mortgage, you also have to buy a lender’s title insurance 
policy to protect your lender against title risks.
treasury bills (T-bills): Short-term U.S.-government bonds. Some ARM 
indexes are based on the interest rate that the government pays on the pile 
of federal debt. The most commonly used government interest rate indexes 
for ARMs are for six-month and twelve-month treasury bills. The treasury bill 
indexes tend to respond quickly to market changes in interest rates.
VA loans: Loans made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the 
Veterans Administration). These mortgages help eligible people (those on 
active duty; qualified unmarried, former spouses of veterans; and veterans of 
the American military services) buy primary residences. The rules to obtain 
these mortgages are less stringent in certain respects than are the rules for 
conventional mortgages. VA loans require no down payment as long as the 
appraised value of the house is below a certain threshold level, and the inter-
est rate on VA loans typically falls 0.5 to 1 percent below the rate currently 
being charged on conventional loans.
