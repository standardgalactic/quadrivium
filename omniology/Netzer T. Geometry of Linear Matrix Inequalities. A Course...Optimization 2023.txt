Introduction and Preliminaries 
In this ﬁrst chapter we give an introduction and outline of the topics from the book. 
We also introduce basic notions and results from linear algebra, convexity theory 
and real algebraic geometry. 
1.1
Introduction 
Optimization, an important branch of mathematics, is becoming ever more inﬂuen-
tial with steadily increasing computational power. Convex optimization is consid-
ered to be its most accessible form, allowing for efﬁcient numerical and geometrical 
approaches, such as interior point and subgradient methods, as well as duality 
theory. Many of the solution methods are of polynomial complexity, at least up 
to arbitrary precision, see [5,13] for a comprehensive general overview. 
For a long time, linear programming has been, and still is, the most important 
subclass of convex programming, and a thorough theory of linear programming 
has been established, combined with highly effective solution procedures (see for 
example [19,20]). The feasible sets of linear programming are polytopes/polyhedra, 
convex sets deﬁned by ﬁnitely many afﬁne linear inequalities. The study of 
polyhedra from a geometric point of view reaches far back in history, but it 
also remains a challenging branch of modern research, see for example [106]. 
Polyhedra are of an intrinsically combinatorial nature, which allows to apply special 
geometric and algebraic methods to study them. On the other hand, this clearly 
hinders applicability of linear programming to problems which are not of such 
combinatorial ﬂavor. 
Semideﬁnite programming, a much more recent development, can come to the 
rescue here (see Sect. B.3 from the Appendix for an exact deﬁnition). As a still 
restrictive class of convex optimization problems, it allows for efﬁcient numerical 
solution schemes, mostly based on interior point methods with barrier function (see 
for example [66,101,102,105]). Furthermore, several restrictions imposed by linear

Introduction and Preliminaries
programming disappear. One of the ﬁrst signiﬁcant applications stems from [36], 
where the stable set problem for graphs was translated into a semideﬁnite program, 
solvable in polynomial time for perfect graphs. In recent times, semideﬁnite 
programming has found numerous other applications [3,12,21,56,76]. 
The feasible sets of semideﬁnite programming are called spectrahedra. They are  
sets deﬁned by linear matrix inequalities, i.e., by the condition that a symmetric 
matrix with afﬁne linear entries is positive semideﬁnite. This involves the spectrum 
of matrices and generalizes polyhedra, which explains the name [86]. Spectrahedra 
are very special convex sets. They share some important properties with polyhedra, 
but also generalize these to a great extend. Furthermore, linear images of spectrahe-
dra, so-called spectrahedral shadows, are equally useful for optimization, and they 
extend the class of convex sets even more. 
The study of spectrahedra and their shadows as geometric objects is much 
younger, among the earliest works seem to be [59, 77, 86] from the 1990s. Again, 
the area has seen tremendous progress in recent years, combining results and 
methods from such diverse areas as (real) algebraic geometry, convexity theory, 
operator algebra, discrete geometry and optimization. Among the landmark results 
are surely Ramana and Goldman [86] with a ﬁrst systematic study of the geometry of 
spectrahedra, the relaxation techniques by Lasserre [56,57] and Parrilo [76], Helton 
and Vinnikov’s [43] classiﬁcation of spectrahedra in dimension two (which also 
gives a solution to the Lax conjecture [60,61]), the positive results of Helton and Nie 
on spectrahedral shadows [41, 42], and Scheiderer’s classiﬁcation of spectrahedral 
shadows in dimension two [98], as well as his obstructions in higher dimensions 
[99]. All these insights are not only fascinating from a geometric point of view, but 
can also help to develop more efﬁcient optimization algorithms and extend their 
ﬁeld of application. 
Of particular relevance in optimization are questions as the following: Given a 
certain set (often described by polynomial inequalities), what is a good description 
of its convex hull? Can semideﬁnite programming be performed on this convex hull, 
i.e., is it a spectrahedron or a spectrahedral shadow? If so, ﬁnd explicit descriptions 
by linear matrix inequalities. If not, ﬁnd good inner or outer approximations by sets 
on which semideﬁnite programming can be performed. Try to make the optimization 
as efﬁcient as possible, by ﬁnding semideﬁnite presentations of smallest possible 
size and complexity. 
The goal of this book is to give an up-to-date presentation of the most important 
results on the geometry of spectrahedra and their projections. Even though the 
motivation comes from computational problems and in particular from optimization, 
our focus will mostly be on geometry and theoretical foundations. We tried to keep 
the exposition as elementary as possible, to make the book useful for pure and 
applied mathematicians, and hopefully even for engineers with a solid background 
in mathematics. Many of the results should be accessible with good a knowledge of 
linear algebra, some require more background from algebra and (real) algebraic 
geometry. We provide some of this non-standard background material in the 
appendix. We point out that [9] partially covers similar subjects, combining chapters

by different authors. That book, however, is much more focused on applications and 
less on the geometric aspects that we explain here. 
This book is organized as follows. Chapter 2 is devoted to a systematic study of 
spectrahedra. We give deﬁnitions and explain ﬁrst important properties in Sects. 2.1 
and 2.2. These sections also contain large classes of examples. In Sects. 2.3 and 2.4 
we explain the connections between spectrahedra, hyperbolic polynomials and 
determinantal representations. This culminates in a proof of the Helton-Vinnikov 
Theorem on two-dimensional spectrahedra in Sect. 2.5. Section 2.6 explains con-
nections between graphs and spectrahedra, proving Brändén’s results on elementary 
symmetric polynomials and derivative cones. Section 2.8 contains an overview of 
the theory of non-commutative spectrahedra and their relations to operator systems. 
Chapter 3 treats linear images of spectrahedra, so-called spectrahedral shadows. 
After introducing the concept in Sect. 3.1, we review in Sect. 3.2 the many construc-
tions they permit. The important Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation method is explained 
in Sect. 3.3. Based on this, we prove Scheiderer’s result on spectrahedral shadows 
in the plane in Sect. 3.4. Section 3.5 contains the results of Helton and Nie on 
exactness of relaxations, and they are applied to hyperbolicity cones in Sect. 3.6. 
After presenting some general obstructions to the relaxation method in Sect. 3.7, the  
main part of the book closes with Sect. 3.8 and Scheiderer’s examples of convex 
semialgebraic sets that are not spectrahedral shadows. 
The Appendix contains two parts. In Sect. A we collect necessary background 
material on real algebraic geometry, most notably Archimedean Positivstellensätze 
for polynomials and matrix polynomials. Section B explains some concepts and 
results from convexity theory and optimization. 
This book presents many wonderful results of our colleagues. Among them 
are Petter Brändén, João Gouveia, Bill Helton, Igor Klep, Mario Kummer, Jean 
Lasserre, Pablo Parrilo, Mihai Putinar, Claus Scheiderer, Konrad Schmüdgen, 
Markus Schweighofer, Rainer Sinn, Andreas Thom, Victor Vinnikov and Cynthia 
Vinzant. We thank them all for numerous discussions on the topic of this book. 
A preliminary version was used as lecture notes for courses at the Universities of 
Innsbruck, Konstanz and Leipzig. We thank our students for the interest, and for 
many remarks and questions that helped improving the exposition a lot. All graphics 
in this book were created with Mathematica [104]. 
1.2
Preliminaries 
Let us ﬁx some preliminaries that we will use throughout this book. 
A subset upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn is convex if for all u comma v element of upper Su, v ∈S and lamda element of left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracketλ ∈[0, 1] we have 
lamda u plus left parenthesis 1 minus lamda right parenthesis v element of upper S periodλu + (1 −λ)v ∈S.
So S must contain all line segments between its points (Fig. 1.1). For any given set 
upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn, there is a smallest convex superset, called the convex hull c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) of S. It

i=1 λi = 1. Sometimes it is helpful to employ 
Carathéodory’s Theorem (see for example [3] Theorem 2.3), which says that convex 
combinations of length m equals n plus 1m = n + 1 sufﬁce when taking convex hulls in double struck upper R Superscript nRn. 
One reason why convex sets are so important in optimization is that the 
supremum/inﬁmum of an afﬁne linear function on a set S coincides with its 
supremum/inﬁmum on c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S). Since convex sets have a much simpler geometry 
than general sets, this makes optimization over convex sets much easier to handle. 
Just like projective geometry often behaves much more regular than afﬁne geom-
etry, convex cones often behave more regular than general convex sets (Fig. 1.2). 
A convex cone is a subset upper C subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nC ⊆Rn such that for all u comma v element of upper Cu, v ∈C and lamda comma gamma greater than or slanted equals 0λ, γ ⩾0 we have 
lamda v plus gamma u element of upper C periodλv + γ u ∈C.
So C must be closed under positive combinations instead of just convex combina-
tions. The smallest convex cone containing a set S is called the conic hull c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesiscone(S)
of S. It consists of all positive combinations of elements from S, and Carathéodory’s 
Theorem says that positive combinations of length n always sufﬁce in double struck upper R Superscript nRn. A general 
procedure how to pass from convex sets to convex cones and vice versa (without 
losing too much information) is described in more detail in Remark 2.31 (1) below. 
Good general references for convexity theory are for example [3,90] or [103] .

Let us continue with some linear algebra. If R is a ring, we write 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column upper M a t Subscript s times t Baseline left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis 2nd Column equals space of all matrices of size s times t with entries in upper R comma 2nd Row 1st Column upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis 2nd Column equals ring of all square matrices of size s with entries in upper R comma 3rd Row 1st Column upper G upper L Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis 2nd Column equals group of invertible square matrices of size s over upper R comma 4th Row 1st Column upper S y m Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis 2nd Column equals space of all symmetric matrices of size s with entries in upper R period EndLayoutMats×t(R) = space of all matrices of size s × t with entries in R,
Mats(R) = ring of all square matrices of size s with entries in R,
GLs(R) = group of invertible square matrices of size s over R,
Syms(R) = space of all symmetric matrices of size s with entries in R.
Unless speciﬁed otherwise, matrices will always be assumed to have real entries. We 
write upper M a t Subscript sMats, upper S y m Subscript sSyms, etc. to denote upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisMats(R), upper S y m Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisSyms(R), etc. Sometimes we will write 
upper H e r Subscript sHers for the set of all complex Hermitian matrices, i.e., matrices with upper A Superscript asterisk Baseline equals upper AA∗= A, 
where upper A Superscript asterisk Baseline equals left parenthesis ModifyingAbove upper A With quotation dash right parenthesis Superscript upper TA∗= (A)T denotes the conjugate transpose of A. On upper S y m Subscript sSyms and upper H e r Subscript sHers we will 
often use the standard inner product, deﬁned as 
left angle bracket upper P comma upper Q right angle bracket colon equals trace left parenthesis upper P upper Q right parenthesis period⟨P, Q⟩:= Tr(PQ).
It is well-known that real symmetric matrices can be diagonalized: for upper M element of upper S y m Subscript sM ∈Syms
there exists an orthogonal matrix upper U element of upper M a t Subscript sU ∈Mats (i.e., upper U Superscript negative 1 Baseline equals upper U Superscript upper TU−1 = UT ) with 
upper U Superscript negative 1 Baseline upper M upper U equals upper U Superscript upper T Baseline upper M upper U equals d i a g left parenthesis lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis periodU−1MU = UT MU = diag(λ1, . . . , λs).
In this case, the diagonal entries lamda Subscript iλi are the eigenvalues of M, and hence uniquely 
determined (up to ordering). When relaxing orthogonality of U to invertibility, the 
lamda Subscript iλi in 
upper U Superscript upper T Baseline upper M upper U equals d i a g left parenthesis lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisUT MU = diag(λ1, . . . , λs)
are not uniquely determined anymore, they can in fact all be normalized to negative 1 comma 0 comma 1−1, 0, 1. 
However, the number of positive and negative lamda Subscript iλi is still uniquely determined, 
by Sylvester’s Law of Inertia. If  M has p positive and n negative signs in a 
diagonalization, the pair left parenthesis p comma n right parenthesis(p, n) is called the signature of M. 
Recall that a real symmetric matrix upper M element of upper S y m Subscript sM ∈Syms is called positive semideﬁnite 
(psd) if 
v Superscript upper T Baseline upper M v greater than or slanted equals 0vT Mv ⩾0
holds for all v element of double struck upper R Superscript sv ∈Rs. It is called positive deﬁnite if this inequality is strict for all 
v not equals 0v ̸= 0. We write 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus 2nd Column equals convex cone of positive semidefinite matrices of size s 2nd Row 1st Column upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus plus 2nd Column equals convex cone of positive definite matrices of size s period EndLayout Sym+

Introduction and Preliminaries
Note that upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s is the closure of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus plusSym++
s
and upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus plusSym++
s
is the interior of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s in the 
ﬁnite-dimensional space upper S y m Subscript sSyms. For a symmetric matrix M, we will write upper M greater than or slanted equals 0M ⩾0 if 
it is positive semideﬁnite, and upper M greater than 0M > 0 if it is positive deﬁnite. We extend this to a 
partial order on upper S y m Subscript sSyms by writing upper M greater than or slanted equals upper NM ⩾N if upper M minus upper N greater than or slanted equals 0M −N ⩾0. 
Exercise 1.1 
Let M be a real symmetric matrix of size s and rank r. 
1. Show that the following are equivalent: 
(i) M is positive semideﬁnite. 
(ii) All eigenvalues of M are nonnegative. 
(iii) There exists a real r times sr × s-matrix Q with upper M equals upper Q Superscript upper T Baseline upper QM = QT Q. 
(iv) There exists a symmetric and positive semideﬁnite s times ss × s-matrix P with upper M equals upper P squaredM =
P 2. 
(v) All principal minors of M are nonnegative. 
(vi) All principal minors of size at most r of M are nonnegative. 
2. If upper P Superscript upper T Baseline upper P equals upper Q Superscript upper T Baseline upper QP T P = QT Q with P and Q of the same size r times sr × s, there exists an orthogonal 
r times rr × r-matrix U such that upper P equals upper U upper QP = UQ. 
3. For upper M element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusM ∈Sym+
s , the matrix P in 1(iv) is uniquely determined (and commonly 
denoted StartRoot upper M EndRoot

M). StartRoot upper M EndRoot

M lies in the subalgebra of upper M a t Subscript sMats generated by M. 
4. For upper M element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusM ∈Sym+
s and v element of double struck upper R Superscript s Baseline commav ∈Rs, show that v Superscript upper T Baseline upper M v equals 0vT Mv = 0 implies upper M v equals 0Mv = 0. 
5. For upper M element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusM ∈Sym+
s , show that trace left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals 0Tr(M) = 0 implies upper M equals 0M = 0. 
Finally, we will need some basic notions from real algebraic geometry. We 
always denote by double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] the real polynomial ring in the variables x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesisx = (x1, . . . , xn). 
For p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketp1, . . . , pr ∈R[x] we write p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) for the tuple and deﬁne

a basic closed (semialgebraic) set (Fig. 1.3). A general semialgebraic set is a ﬁnite 
Boolean combination of basic closed sets. 
One of the most important results on semialgebraic sets is the projection theorem, 
also closely related to quantiﬁer elimination and Tarski’s transfer principle in real 
algebraic geometry (see [10,63,83] for details and proofs). 
Theorem 1.2 (Projection Theorem) 
If upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript m Baseline times double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rm × Rn is semialgebraic and pi colon double struck upper R Superscript m Baseline times double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nπ : Rm × Rn →Rn is the canonical 
projection, then pi left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nπ(S) ⊆Rn is semialgebraic.

The result immediately extends to arbitrary polynomial mappings instead of 
projections. Note however, that the projection of a (basic) closed set is not 
necessarily (basic) closed.

Linear Matrix Inequalities and Spectrahedra 
In this chapter we introduce the notion of a spectrahedron, and thoroughly study its 
properties. We will see many examples, and learn methods to determine whether a 
given set is a spectrahedron or not. In most cases we will also obtain procedures to 
explicitly construct deﬁning linear matrix inequalities. 
2.1
Spectrahedra 
A polyhedron is a subset of double struck upper R Superscript nRn described by a ﬁnite number of afﬁne linear 
inequalities. Compact polyhedra are exactly the polytopes, i.e., the convex hulls 
of ﬁnitely many points. These are the simplest (and the most extensively studied) 
convex sets. Spectrahedra, our basic objects, are generalizations of polyhedra that 
comprise many more sets, but still share some of the good properties of polyhedra. 
Just as polyhedra are the feasible sets of linear progamming, spectrahedra are the 
feasible sets of semideﬁnite programming. 
Deﬁnition 2.1 
A spectrahedron in double struck upper R Superscript nRn is the inverse image of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s under an afﬁne linear map 
double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow upper S y m Subscript sRn →Syms, for  some s element of double struck upper Ns ∈N. 
Many of the basic geometric properties we explain in this section can already 
be found in [86]. Spectrahedra are clearly convex, since the inverse image of any 
convex set under an afﬁne linear map is again convex (Fig. 2.1). Occasionally, we 
may ﬁnd it convenient not to ﬁx coordinates and consider a spectrahedron in a ﬁnite-
dimensional real vector space V given as the inverse image of upper S y m left parenthesis upper W right parenthesis Superscript plusSym(W)+ under 
an afﬁne linear map upper Phi colon upper V right arrow upper S y m left parenthesis upper W right parenthesis: V →Sym(W), for some ﬁnite-dimensional real vector 
space W. Here, upper S y m left parenthesis upper W right parenthesisSym(W) denotes the space of symmetric bilinear forms on W, and 
upper S y m left parenthesis upper W right parenthesis Superscript plusSym(W)+ denotes the convex cone of positive semideﬁnite forms.

Examples 2.2 
1. Any polyhedron is also a spectrahedron. For if upper P equals script upper S left parenthesis script l 1 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisP = S(ℓ1, . . . , ℓs) is a polyhedron deﬁned 
by polynomials script l 1 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript s Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketℓ1, . . . , ℓs ∈R[x] of degree one, then upper P equals script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisP = S(M) for the diagonal matrix 
polynomial upper M equals upper D i a g left parenthesis script l 1 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisM = Diag(ℓ1, . . . , ℓs). This also shows that semideﬁnite programming is a 
generalization of linear programming. 
While any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized, the same is not true for matrix 
polynomials, because the ﬁnitely many coefﬁcient-matrices need not be simultaneously 
diagonalizable (see also Exercise 2.4). Therefore, not every spectrahedron is a polyhedron.

Moreover, upper G Subscript German m Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisGm(p) classiﬁes the representations of p as a sum of squares up to orthogonal

Exercise 2.6 
Let upper S comma upper T subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS, T ⊆Rn be spectrahedra. Prove that upper S intersection upper TS ∩T is a spectrahedron.
▶Remark 2.7 While the deﬁnition of a spectrahedron is simple enough, there 
are two different ways to think about it, corresponding to somewhat different 
geometric pictures. 
1. We may think of a spectrahedron as a subset of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline commaRn, deﬁned by a linear matrix 
inequality. This is also the dominant point of view in the dual formulation of a 
semideﬁnite program, see Sect. B.3. We can rewrite this as an inﬁnite system 
of ordinary linear inequalities: If upper M left parenthesis x right parenthesisM(x) is a linear matrix polynomial, then 
script l Subscript v Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals v Superscript upper T Baseline upper M left parenthesis x right parenthesis vℓv(x) = vT M(x)v is a polynomial of degree at most 1 in the variables x, for  
any v element of double struck upper R Superscript sv ∈Rs, and 
script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals StartSet u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar script l Subscript v Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 for all v element of double struck upper R Superscript s Baseline EndSet periodS(M) =

u ∈Rn | ℓv(u) ⩾0 for all v ∈Rs
.

We may think of double struck upper R Superscript sRs as a parameter space for the linear inequalities describing 
the convex set script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M). Note that any closed convex set is described by an 
inﬁnite family of linear inequalities: Given a closed convex subset S of double struck upper R Superscript nRn, let  
script upper L equals left brace script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket StartAbsoluteValue degree left parenthesis script l right parenthesis less than or slanted equals 1 comma script l EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0 right brace commaL =

,
then upper S equals left brace u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar for all script l element of script upper L colon script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right brace periodS = {u ∈Rn | ∀ℓ∈L:
ℓ(u) ⩾0}. This follows from the Bipolar 
Theorem B.5 for closed convex sets. What makes spectrahedra special is the 
simple parametrization of script upper LL in terms of a linear matrix polynomial. 
2. We may also think of a spectrahedron as a set of matrices, which is the point of 
view in the primal formulation of a semideﬁnite program (see again Sect. B.3). 
Let upper M left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper M 0 plus x 1 upper M 1 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus x Subscript n Baseline upper M Subscript nM(x) = M0 + x1M1 + · · · + xnMn be a linear matrix polynomial, and

the corresponding afﬁne linear map. Consider the set of matrices 
im left parenthesis upper Phi Subscript upper M Baseline right parenthesis intersection upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline periodim(M) ∩Sym+
s .
If upper Phi Subscript upper MM is injective, we can identify this with script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M). The geometric picture here 
is that of a convex cone (namely upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s ) sliced by an afﬁne linear subspace. 
The subspace we are slicing with is the span of upper M 1 comma ellipsis comma upper M Subscript n BaselineM1, . . . , Mn shifted by upper M 0M0. 
For instance, this is the way we would think about the Gram spectrahedra in 
Example 2.2 (4). If upper Phi Subscript upper MM is not injective, then script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) is essentially a cylinder 
over im left parenthesis upper Phi Subscript upper M Baseline right parenthesis intersection upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusim(M) ∩Sym+
s , given in terms of the kernel of upper Phi Subscript upper MM (see Exercise 2.10 
below), so we do not loose too much by passing to the image. 
It is instructive to make the analogy with polyhedra again: Let 
upper P equals left brace u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar script l 1 left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right braceP =

u ∈Rn | ℓ1(u) ⩾0, . . . , ℓs(u) ⩾0

and consider the afﬁne linear map 
upper Phi colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript s Baseline comma u right arrow from bar left parenthesis script l 1 left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis period: Rn →Rs, u →(ℓ1(u), . . . , ℓs(u)).
Then P is the inverse image of the positive orthant double struck upper R Subscript plus Superscript sRs
+ under upper Phi. Thus, again 
up to injectivity of upper Phi, any polyhedron is a slice of a standard cone double struck upper R Subscript plus Superscript sRs
+ for 
some s, just as in the case of spectrahedra. 
The following result provides another class of examples of spectrahedra. It 
will become very important for the deﬁnition of the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation in 
Sect. 3.3. We let  upper Sigma Subscript 2 d2d denote the set of sums of squares of polynomials of degree at 
most d, i.e.,

⊓⊔
One can make a theory of spectrahedra deﬁned by Hermitian matrices, which 
may be the natural point of view for certain questions (for example in quantum 
physics). However, in terms of the class of sets that one obtains, this does not add 
anything new, essentially due to the following simple observation. We will thus 
mostly restrict to real symmetric matrix polynomials in the following. 
Lemma 2.9 
Let M be a Hermitian linear matrix polynomial of size s times ss × s (i.e., all its 
coefﬁcient matrices upper M Subscript iMi are Hermitian). Then there exists a real symmetric

we could always artiﬁcially enlarge M by adding zeros, since

▶Remark 2.15 Lemma 2.12 essentially says that it is enough to consider spectra-
hedra deﬁned by monic linear matrix polynomials. For if S is any spectrahedron, 
let V be its afﬁne hull. Then S has nonempty relative interior in V , and after a 
translation we may assume that 0 is in the relative interior of S. We may then 
change coordinates, replace double struck upper R Superscript nRn by V , and assume that S is given by a monic 
linear matrix polynomial. 
While this argument works ﬁne as a ﬁrst reduction step in a proof, actually 
computing a monic representation in large examples can be a difﬁcult and 
computationally expensive task, which is usually avoided whenever possible.

First Properties of Spectrahedra 
In general it can be very hard to decide whether a given set is a spectrahedron or not. 
It might even be harder to ﬁnd an explicit linear matrix polynomial that describes 
the set. We will thus start with some easy properties that all spectrahedra share, i.e., 
we will state necessary conditions for a set to be a spectrahedron. 
Proposition 2.20 
Spectrahedra are convex and basic closed semialgebraic. 
Proof Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS = S(M) for some linear matrix polynomial M of size s. Convexity 
of S is clear from the deﬁnition. We must show that there exist polynomials 
p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketp1, . . . , pr ∈R[x] such that upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisS = S(p1, . . . , pr). To say that upper M left parenthesis u right parenthesisM(u) is positive 
semideﬁnite for u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn is saying that all its eigenvalues are nonnegative. The 
eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial 
chi Subscript upper M left parenthesis u right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis t upper I Subscript s Baseline minus upper M left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis periodχM(u)(t) = det(tIs −M(u)).
Thus u is a point in S if and only if chi Subscript upper M left parenthesis u right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis negative t right parenthesisχM(u)(−t) has no positive roots. By the 
subsequent lemma, this is the case if and only if all coefﬁcients of left parenthesis negative 1 right parenthesis Superscript s Baseline chi Subscript upper M left parenthesis u right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis negative t right parenthesis(−1)sχM(u)(−t)
are greater than or equal to zero. Thus we can take p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr to be the coefﬁcients 
of 
left parenthesis negative 1 right parenthesis Superscript s Baseline chi Subscript upper M left parenthesis x right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis negative t right parenthesis(−1)sχM(x)(−t)
as a polynomial in t, and even obtain r equals s periodr = s.
⊓⊔
Lemma 2.21 
Let p element of double struck upper R left bracket t right bracketp ∈R[t] be a monic polynomial in one variable, and assume that all roots 
of p are real. Then p has no positive roots if and only if all its coefﬁcients are 
nonnegative. 
Proof Clearly, if all coefﬁcients of p are nonnegative, it cannot have positive roots. 
Conversely, if the roots of p are minus alpha 1 comma ellipsis comma minus alpha Subscript s Baseline−α1, . . . , −αs with alpha Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0αi ⩾0, then all coefﬁcients of 
p equals left parenthesis t plus alpha 1 right parenthesis midline horizontal ellipsis left parenthesis t plus alpha Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisp = (t + α1) · · · (t + αs)
are nonnegative.

upper M left parenthesis x right parenthesisM(x) with the last k rows and 
columns deleted, for k equals s minus 1 comma ellipsis comma 0k = s −1, . . . , 0. These are s polynomials of ascending 
degree 1 comma ellipsis comma s1, . . . , s. But in general it is not true that the closure of a basic open 
set

is the basic closed set script upper S left parenthesis g 1 comma ellipsis comma g Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisS(g1, . . . , gs), and it is indeed not true that a matrix 
is positive semideﬁnite if all its leading principal minors are nonnegative (just 
take the diagonal matrix upper D i a g left parenthesis 0 comma negative 1 right parenthesisDiag(0, −1), all of whose leading principal minors 
are 0). What is true, however, is that a matrix is positive semideﬁnite if and 
only if all its principal minors are nonnegative (which are the determinants of 
the submatrices of M obtained by deleting all rows and columns with indices 
in some subset of StartSet 1 comma ellipsis comma s EndSet{1, . . . , s}), see Exercise 1.1. This gives another proof of 
Proposition 2.20. However, this description uses 2 Superscript s Baseline minus 12s −1 inequalities rather 
than s.

upper M equals Start 3 By 3 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column 1 2nd Column x 1 3rd Column x 2 2nd Row 1st Column x 1 2nd Column 1 3rd Column 0 3rd Row 1st Column x 2 2nd Column 0 3rd Column 1 EndMatrixM =

Let v 1 equals left parenthesis negative 1 comma 0 right parenthesisv1 = (−1, 0) and v 2 equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesisv2 = (1, 0) in double struck upper R squaredR2 and let upper S equals upper B 1 left parenthesis v 1 right parenthesis union upper B 1 left parenthesis v 2 right parenthesisS = B1(v1) ∪B1(v2), i.e., the 
union of two discs of radius 1 about v 1v1 and v 2v2. Show that S is basic closed, but the 
convex hull of S is not. Getting the idea is more important than a rigorous proof. 
This convex hull is called the (very old-fashioned) soccer stadium.

In view of Proposition 2.20, the soccer stadium is not a spectrahedron.

be an afﬁne section of 
the cone of univariate nonnegative polynomials. Show that C is closed, convex and 
semialgebraic, but not basic closed. 
So this set is not a spectrahedron, and thus clearly the cone of globally nonnegative 
univariate polynomials of degree at most 4 is not a spectrahedron. Note that all 
nonnegative polynomials in one variable are sums of squares of polynomials (see 
for example [63,83]). 
Another property of spectrahedra is that all their faces are exposed, see Sect. B.2 
for the deﬁnition and some properties. This was ﬁrst proven in [86]. 
Theorem 2.26 
All faces of spectrahedra are exposed. 
Proof Consider ﬁrst the cone upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s itself. If upper A element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusA ∈Sym+
s is any positive semideﬁnite 
matrix, it is not hard to show (see for example [3, §II.12]) that the unique face of 
upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s containing A in its relative interior is 
upper F equals StartSet upper B element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline vertical bar kernel upper A subset of or equal to kernel upper B EndSet periodF =

B ∈Sym+
s | ker A ⊆ker B

.
To see that such F is an exposed face, let C be a psd matrix with im upper C equals kernel upper Aim C = ker A. 
Now given upper B element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusB ∈Sym+
s with left angle bracket upper B comma upper C right angle bracket equals 0⟨B, C⟩= 0, we have upper B upper C equals 0BC = 0 (since C is also psd) and 
hence kernel upper A equals im upper C subset of or equal to kernel upper Bker A = im C ⊆ker B. This shows upper F equals StartSet upper B element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline vertical bar left angle bracket upper B comma upper C right angle bracket equals 0 EndSetF = {B ∈Sym+
s | ⟨B, C⟩= 0}, so that 
F is exposed. 
Now if upper U subset of or equal to upper S y m Subscript sU ⊆Syms is an afﬁne linear subspace and F a face of the spectrahedron 
upper U intersection upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusU ∩Sym+
s , let  upper A element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper F right parenthesisA ∈relint(F) and let upper F primeF ′ be the unique face of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s with upper A element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper F prime right parenthesisA ∈
relint(F ′). Then upper F prime intersection upper UF ′ ∩U contains A in its relative interior, hence upper F prime intersection upper U equals upper FF ′ ∩U = F. By

22

Linear Matrix Inequalities and Spectrahedra
what we have just seen, upper F prime equals StartSet upper B element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline vertical bar left angle bracket upper B comma upper C right angle bracket equals 0 EndSetF ′ = {B ∈Sym+
s | ⟨B, C⟩= 0} for some upper C element of upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusC ∈Sym+
s , so  
that upper F equals StartSet upper B element of upper U intersection upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline vertical bar left angle bracket upper B comma upper C right angle bracket equals 0 EndSetF = {B ∈U ∩Sym+
s | ⟨B, C⟩= 0} is also exposed. 
In general, if upper Phi colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow upper S y m Subscript s Baseline: Rn →Syms is an afﬁne linear map, the faces of upper Phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline right parenthesis−1(Sym+
s )
are in bijection with the faces of upper S equals im upper Phi intersection upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusS = im ∩Sym+
s , and if H is a hyperplane in upper S y m Subscript sSyms
exposing a face upper H intersection upper SH ∩S, the corresponding face upper Phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper H intersection upper S right parenthesis equals upper Phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper H right parenthesis intersection upper Phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis−1(H ∩S) = −1(H) ∩−1(S)
of upper Phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis−1(S) is also exposed. 
⊓⊔
Exercise 2.27 
Fill in the details in the above proof. 
Example 2.28 
1. Consider the convex basic closed semialgbraic set 
S = S(x2 − x3 
1, 1 +  x1, 1 −x1, x2, 1 − x2). 
The origin is a non-exposed face of S, since the only linear polynomial script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 with 
script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ|S ⩾0 and script l left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis equals 0ℓ(0, 0) = 0 is script l equals x 2ℓ= x2 (up to scaling), which however exposes the larger face 
StartSet left parenthesis u 1 comma 0 right parenthesis element of double struck upper R squared vertical bar negative 1 less than or slanted equals u 1 less than or slanted equals 0 EndSet{(u1, 0) ∈R2 | −1 ⩽u1 ⩽0} of upper S commaS, rather than just the origin. So although S is basic 
closed and convex, it is not a spectrahedron. 
2. Since the set from Exercise 2.25 also has a non-esposed face (the origin), Theorem 2.26 
gives another way to see that it is not a spectrahedron. 
Finally, there is a very restrictive necessary condition for being a spectrahedron, 
called real zero property (or hyperbolicity, in the homogeneous setting). This 
property comes from the fact that symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues, and 
it in fact entails all the already mentioned properties of spectrahedra. If upper M equals upper I Subscript s Baseline plus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts x Subscript i Baseline upper M Subscript iM =
Is + n
i=1 xiMi is a monic linear matrix polynomial of size s, the determinant 
p equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisp = det(M) is a polynomial (of degree at most s) in  double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x], which vanishes on the 
boundary of the spectrahedron script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M). Since all the matrices sigma summation u Subscript i Baseline upper M Subscript i uiMi for u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn are 
real symmetric, their characteristic polynomials det left parenthesis t upper I Subscript s Baseline minus sigma summation u Subscript i Baseline upper M Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisdet(tIs − uiMi) have only real 
roots. Since 
det left parenthesis t upper I Subscript s Baseline minus sigma summation u Subscript i Baseline upper M Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals t Superscript s Baseline det left parenthesis upper M left parenthesis t Superscript negative 1 Baseline u right parenthesis right parenthesis equals t Superscript s Baseline p left parenthesis t Superscript negative 1 Baseline u right parenthesis commadet

this implies that for all 0 not equals u element of double struck upper R Superscript n0 ̸= u ∈Rn the function t right arrow from bar p left parenthesis t u right parenthesist →p(tu) has only real roots. 
In other words, the intersection points of the zero set of p with lines through the 
origin are all real. This can be seen for a polynomial p element of double struck upper R left bracket x 1 comma x 2 right bracketp ∈R[x1, x2] of degree 4 in

with spectrahedra is [43]. Many of these results will be discussed in detail in 
the following sections. For now, the basic point we wish to make is simply that 
spectrahedra are very special convex sets. 
Example 2.29 The set StartSet left parenthesis u 1 comma u 2 right parenthesis element of double struck upper R squared vertical bar u 1 Superscript 4 Baseline plus u 2 Superscript 4 Baseline less than or slanted equals 1 EndSet{(u1, u2) ∈R2 | u4

Exercise 2.30 
Prove that the TV screen is indeed not a spectrahedron. 
We will ﬁnish this section with a remark on homogenization and dehomoge-
nization of polynomials and convex sets. This will allow us to switch between the 
homogeneous and non-homogeneous setting in the following, and between arbitrary 
convex sets and convex cones.

1. Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS

upper C equals c o n e left parenthesis StartSet 1 EndSet times upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1 Baseline periodC = cone ({1} × S) ⊆Rn+1.
Thus C is a convex cone by construction, and we recover S by intersecting

x 0 comma x 1 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baselinex0, x1, . . . , xn on double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisRn+1) (Fig. 2.4). When we intersect the closure c l o s left parenthesis upper C right parenthesisclos(C) with 
this afﬁne hyperplane, we obtain the closure c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S) of S. When we intersect

Exercise 2.6. 
Conversely, if c l o s left parenthesis upper C right parenthesisclos(C) is a spectrahedral cone, then c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S) is a spectrahedron. 
This is easily seen by adding the constraints plus or minus left parenthesis 1 minus x 0 right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0±(1 −x0) ⩾0 to the matrix 
polynomial deﬁning c l o s left parenthesis upper C right parenthesisclos(C). 
The cone C can be understood as a homogenization of S. Just as projective 
geometry often behaves more regular than afﬁne geometry, convex cones often 
behave more regular than convex sets. The described construction shows how 
one can often reduce to the conic case. The same construction can clearly be 
done with any other (afﬁne) hyperplane in double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1Rn+1 as well.

This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in the additional variable x 0x0, 
and p is obtained by setting x 0 equals 1x0 = 1. So the zero set of p is recovered by 
intersecting the zero set of h with the afﬁne hyperplane deﬁned by x 0 equals 1x0 = 1, 
whereas the intersection with the hyperplane x 0 equals 0x0 = 0 gives the zeros at inﬁnity 
of p. 
The real zero property of a polynomial p corresponds to hyperbolicity of its 
homogenization h, a property which we will discuss in more detail in the next 
section.

Hyperbolic Polynomials 
Hyperbolicity is the homogeneous version of the real-zero property introduced 
above. We will now deﬁne and study it in detail. It is closely connected to 
spectrahedra, but also to partial differential equations [30, 47, 75] and discrete 
structures [15,16,38], and allows for direct convex optimization procedures, called 
hyperbolic programming [4,37,89]. 
Deﬁnition 2.33 
A homogeneous polynomial h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma x 1 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, x1, . . . , xn] is called hyperbolic with 
respect to a point e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1 if h left parenthesis e right parenthesis not equals 0h(e) ̸= 0 and if the univariate polynomial 
h left parenthesis u minus t e right parenthesis element of double struck upper R left bracket t right bracketh(u −te) ∈R[t]
has only real roots, for every u element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1u ∈Rn+1. It is called strictly hyperbolic if it is 
hyperbolic and the roots of h left parenthesis u minus t e right parenthesish(u −te) are all distinct, for every u element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1 minus double struck upper R dot eu ∈Rn+1 \ R · e.

are exactly the eigenvalues of upper M commaM, which are all real. In particular,

In view of these examples, we make the following deﬁnition.

is called the (closed) hyperbolicity cone of h with respect to e. 
In this sense, one can think of hyperbolic polynomials as generalized charac-
teristic polynomials, and the hyperbolicity cones as generalized cones of positive 
semideﬁnite matrices. But in spite of the name, it is not apparent from the deﬁnition 
that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) is indeed a convex cone. Also, the name suggests that h should be 
hyperbolic with respect to any point in the (interior of the) hyperbolicity cone. These 
statements can be proved directly, as is done for example in [33]. Instead, we will 
deduce them later from the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem in Sect. 2.5. See Fig. 2.6 for 
an illustration of a hyperbolicity cone. 
In Example 2.35 (5), we have already seen that the hyperbolicity condition is 
necessary for a cone to be spectrahedral. 
Proposition 2.37 
If M is a homogeneous linear matrix polynomial with upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis greater than 0M(e) > 0 for some 
e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1, the spectrahedral cone script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) coincides with the hyperbolicity 
cone ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis right parenthesisCe(det(M)).
⊓⊔
Thus the following statement is not surprising, though a little additional work is 
needed for the proof, which we will omit here (see [43, §2]).

Theorem 2.38 
Let upper C subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1C ⊆Rn+1 be a basic closed convex cone with nonempty interior. Further, 
let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket minus StartSet 0 EndSeth ∈R[x0, . . . , xn]\{0} be the unique (up to scaling) polynomial of minimal 
degree vanishing on the boundary of C. Then C is a hyperbolicity cone if and 
only if h is hyperbolic with respect to some point e element of i n t left parenthesis upper C right parenthesise ∈int(C), and in this case 
upper C equals ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisC = Ce(h).
⊓⊔
▶Remark 2.39 Theorem 2.38 is useful for checking whether a cone is spectra-
hedral. The polynomial h is often given with the deﬁnition of C, or can easily 
be computed from it. Now hyperbolicity of h is a necessary condition for being 
spectrahedral. 
For example, it shows that the cone 
upper C equals left brace u element of double struck upper R cubed vertical bar u 0 Superscript 4 Baseline greater than or slanted equals u 1 Superscript 4 Baseline plus u 2 Superscript 4 Baseline comma u 0 greater than or slanted equals 0 right braceC = {u ∈R3 | u4

0 −x4
1 −x4
2 is not hyperbolic (c.f. Example 2.35 (2)). In view of Remark 2.31 
this also shows that the TV screen is not a spectrahedron. 
Whether hyperbolicity is also sufﬁcient for being spectrahedral is an open 
question, the so-called generalized Lax conjecture, which we will discuss below. 
Note that checking hyperbolicity of a polynomial will also be hard in general, as 
hard as checking polynomial nonnegativity [93]. At least, it is clear what needs 
to be checked, whereas the deﬁnition of a spectrahedron requires to produce the 
deﬁning matrix polynomial, of which not much is known a priori, not even its 
size. There are also certain approaches to use sums-of-squares techniques for 
certifying hyperbolicity [22,44,69,85]. 
Deﬁnition 2.40 
Given a homogeneous polynomial h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn], and a homogeneous 
symmetric linear matrix polynomial M such that h equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesish = det(M), we say that M is a 
symmetric (linear) determinantal representation of h. If, in addition, upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis greater than 0M(e) > 0
for some e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1, then h is hyperbolic with respect to e, and we say that the 
determinantal representation is deﬁnite.

Exercise 2.41 
Show that every hyperbolic polynomial in two variables x 0 comma x 1x0, x1 possesses a deﬁnite 
symmetric determinantal representation. 
Unfortunately, not every hyperbolic polynomial possesses a symmetric determi-
nantal representation. 
Proposition 2.42 
There exist hyperbolic polynomials in n plus 1n + 1 variables of degree d that do 
not possess a symmetric determinantal representation, in all of the following 
cases: 
n equals 3 and d greater than or slanted equals 7 comma n equals 4 and d greater than or slanted equals 3 comma n greater than or slanted equals 5 and d greater than or slanted equals 2 periodn = 3 and d ⩾7,
n = 4 and d ⩾3,
n ⩾5 and d ⩾2.
Proof The set of hyperbolic polynomials of degree d has nonempty interior 
in the space upper V equals double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesisV
= R[x0, . . . , xn](d) of homogeneous polynomials of degree d. 
Indeed, every strictly hyperbolic polynomial is an interior point of that set (see 
Exercise 2.50), since the roots of a univariate polynomial depend continuously on 
the coefﬁcients. The dimension of the vector space V is StartBinomialOrMatrix n plus d Choose d EndBinomialOrMatrix

. On the other hand, 
if h element of upper Vh ∈V has a symmetric determinantal representation h equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesish = det(M), then M must 
be of size d times dd × d, and the space of homogeneous linear matrix polynomials of size 
d in n plus 1n + 1 variables has dimension left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis StartBinomialOrMatrix d plus 1 Choose 2 EndBinomialOrMatrix(n + 1)

. The map taking M to det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisdet(M)
is polynomial, so the dimension of the image cannot increase (see Theorem A.4 
from the Appendix). It follows that if every hyperbolic polynomial is to possess a 
symmetric determinantal representation, we must have 
left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis StartBinomialOrMatrix d plus 1 Choose 2 EndBinomialOrMatrix equals StartFraction left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis d plus 1 right parenthesis d Over 2 EndFraction greater than or slanted equals StartFraction left parenthesis n plus d right parenthesis factorial Over d factorial n factorial EndFraction equals StartBinomialOrMatrix n plus d Choose d EndBinomialOrMatrix period(n + 1)

This is equivalent to left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis factorial left parenthesis d plus 1 right parenthesis factorial d greater than or slanted equals 2 left parenthesis n plus d right parenthesis factorial(n + 1)!(d + 1)!d ⩾2(n + d)!. Now one can check directly 
that this inequality fails in all the above cases. 
⊓⊔
Exercise 2.43 
Examine the inequality in the proof of Proposition 2.42 for all cases that are not 
stated in the theorem. 
Now if we do the count of parameters in the above proof for n equals 2n = 2, we ﬁnd 
that the resulting inequality holds for all d. In 1957, it was conjectured by Peter 
Lax, in connection with the study of hyperbolic PDEs in [60], that every hyperbolic 
polynomial in three variables possesses a deﬁnite determinantal representation. This 
became known as the Lax conjecture. It was proved in [43] through the work of 
Vinnikov and Helton-Vinnikov.

Theorem 2.44 (Helton-Vinnikov) 
Every hyperbolic polynomial in three variables x 0 comma x 1 comma x 2x0, x1, x2 possesses a deﬁnite 
symmetric determinantal representation. 
Corollary 2.45 
Every three-dimensional hyperbolicity cone is spectrahedral. 
We will not give a full proof of the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem. However, we 
will prove a weaker version in Sect. 2.5 below, namely the existence of deﬁnite 
Hermitian determinantal representations. This will still imply Corollary 2.45, using  
Lemma 2.9. 
Since it is clear from Proposition 2.42 that the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem cannot 
extend to the case n greater than or slanted equals 3n ⩾3, the search began for a suitable higher dimensional 
analogue. Various weaker versions have been proposed in recent years, some of 
which have been disproved (see for example [14,53,72]). Perhaps the most natural 
generalization is simply the statement of Corollary 2.45. 
Generalized Lax Conjecture: Every hyperbolicity cone is a spectrahedron. 
A few special cases of the conjecture are known, but in general it remains elusive. 
Example 2.46 (Quadratic Polynomials) For any hyperbolic polynomial of degree 2, the 
associated hyperbolicity cone is spectrahedral, independent of the dimension. Note that, 
in view of Proposition 2.42, this does not mean they all admit a deﬁnite determinantal 
representation. It can however be shown that some high enough power always admits a 
determinantal representation [72]. Since 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h Superscript r Baseline right parenthesis equals ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe

hr
= Ce (h)
holds for any hyperbolic polynomial h and any r greater than or slanted equals 1r ⩾1, this is enough to prove spectrahedral-
ity. We will prove it in a slightly different way here. Every quadratic form q can be written 
as 
q equals left parenthesis x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis upper M left parenthesis x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis Superscript upper Tq = (x0, . . . , xn)M(x0, . . . , xn)T
with some upper M element of upper S y m Subscript n plus 1M ∈Symn+1. After a change of basis we can assume without loss of generality 
upper M equals d i a g left parenthesis 1 comma ellipsis comma 1 comma negative 1 comma ellipsis comma negative 1 right parenthesis periodM = diag(1, . . . , 1, −1, . . . , −1).

Now it is easily checked that q can only be hyperbolic (with respect to any direction e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈
Rn+1) if the signature of M is left parenthesis 1 comma n right parenthesis(1, n) or left parenthesis n comma 1 right parenthesis(n, 1), i.e., we have if q equals plus or minus left parenthesis x 0 squared minus x 1 squared minus midline horizontal ellipsis minus x Subscript n Superscript 2 Baseline right parenthesisq = ±(x2

We ﬁnish this section by collecting some more facts about hyperbolic polynomi-
als and their hyperbolicity cones. 
Proposition 2.48 
Hyperbolicity cones are basic closed semialgebraic sets. For example, one

(Fig. 2.8). 
2.4
Deﬁnite Determinantal Representations and Interlacing 
To prove the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem, it is helpful to understand it as a statement 
in two parts. The ﬁrst part amounts to the construction of determinantal repre-
sentations over double struck upper RR or double struck upper CC, the second to a characterization of those determinantal 
representations that are deﬁnite, and therefore reﬂect the hyperbolicity. The follow-

Let p comma q element of double struck upper R left bracket t right bracketp, q ∈R[t] be univariate polynomials with degree left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals ddeg(p) = d and degree left parenthesis q right parenthesis equals d minus 1deg(q) = d −1, 
and suppose that p and q have only real roots. Denote the roots of p by 
alpha 1 less than or slanted equals midline horizontal ellipsis less than or slanted equals alpha Subscript dα1 ⩽· · · ⩽αd

We say that q interlaces p if alpha Subscript i Baseline less than or slanted equals beta Subscript i Baseline less than or slanted equals alpha Subscript i plus 1αi ⩽βi ⩽αi+1 for all i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma d minus 1i = 1, . . . , d −1. We say

If h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](d) is hyperbolic with respect to e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1, we say that

Example 2.35 (3). If p element of double struck upper R left bracket t right bracketp ∈R[t] is a univariate polynomial with only real roots, then its 
derivative p primep′ interlaces p, by Rolle’s Theorem. If p does not have multiple roots, it is strictly 
interlaced by p primep′. 
Now more generally, if h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn] is hyperbolic with respect to e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1, the

If  h is

Lemma 2.53 
Suppose that h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](d) is irreducible and hyperbolic with respect 
to e. Fix  f comma gf, g in double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis Baseline commaR[x0, . . . , xn](d−1), where f interlaces h with respect to 
e. Then g interlaces h with respect to e if and only if fg is nonnegative or 
nonpositive on the real zero set script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h) of h in double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1 Baseline periodRn+1.
Proof It sufﬁces to prove this statement for the restriction to a line StartSet u plus t e vertical bar t element of double struck upper R EndSet{u + te | t ∈R}
for generic u element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1u ∈Rn+1. Since h is irreducible, we may therefore assume that the roots 
of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u + te) are distinct from each other and from the roots of f left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesis dot g left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisf (u + te) · g(u + te)
(see Exercise 2.54 below). 
Suppose that fg is nonnegative on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h). By the genericity assumption, the 
product f left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesis g left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisf (u + te)g(u + te) is positive on all the roots of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u + te). Between 
consecutive roots of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u + te), the polynomial f left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisf (u + te) has a single root and 
thus changes sign. For the product fg to be positive on these roots, g left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisg(u + te) must 
also change sign and have a root between each pair of consecutive roots of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u+te). 
Hence g interlaces h with respect to e. 
Conversely, suppose that f and g both interlace h. Between any two consecutive 
roots of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u+te), both f left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisf (u+te) and g left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisg(u+te) each have exactly one root, and their 
product has exactly two. It follows that f left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesis g left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisf (u + te)g(u + te) has the same sign on all 
the roots of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u + te). Taking t right arrow normal infinityt →∞shows this sign to be the sign of f left parenthesis e right parenthesis g left parenthesis e right parenthesisf (e)g(e), 
independent of the choice of u. Hence fg has the same sign at every point of script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h).

Recall that the adjugate matrix of a d times dd × d-matrix M (also called adjoint matrix 
or Cramer matrix) is the d times dd ×d-matrix upper M Superscript a d jMadj whose left parenthesis j comma k right parenthesis(j, k)-entry is left parenthesis negative 1 right parenthesis Superscript j plus k(−1)j+k times the 
left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis times left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis(d −1)×(d −1)-minor of M, obtained by deleting the kth row and jth column and 
taking the determinant. The fundamental fact about the adjugate matrix is 
upper M dot upper M Superscript a d j Baseline equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis dot upper I Subscript d Baseline commaM · Madj = det(M) · Id,
which holds for matrices with entries in any commutative ring. 
If M is a (symmetric or Hermitian) homogeneous linear matrix polynomial of 
size d times dd × d, its adjugate upper M Superscript a d jMadj is, by deﬁnition, a homogeneous matrix polynomial of 
size d times dd × d and degree d minus 1d −1. The relation between M and upper M Superscript a d jMadj will play a crucial

in script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesis right parenthesisVC(det(X)), the matrix X has rank d minus 1d −1. The identity upper X dot upper X Superscript a d j Baseline equals det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesis dot upper I Subscript dX · Xadj = det(X) · Id
implies that upper X Superscript a d jXadj then has rank one at such a point. It follows that the 2 times 22 × 2-matrix

also has rank at most one on the whole of script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesis right parenthesisVC(det(X)). Since the polynomial det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesisdet(X)
is irreducible (Exercise 2.57), the determinant of this 2 times 22 × 2 matrix thus lies in the 
ideal generated by det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesisdet(X), using Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz (see for example [25]). 
Restricting to upper X equals upper MX = M gives the desired identity. 
For the claim of nonnegativity, note that left parenthesis mu Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline lamda right parenthesis equals ModifyingAbove left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline mu right parenthesis With quotation dash(μ∗Madjλ) = (λ∗Madjμ). So the  
polynomial 
left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline lamda right parenthesis left parenthesis mu Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline mu right parenthesis(λ∗Madjλ)(μ∗Madjμ)
is equal to a polynomial times its conjugate modulo det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisdet(M), and is therefore 
nonnegative on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis right parenthesisVR(det(M)).

(xij)i,j of variables, det left parenthesis upper X right parenthesisdet(X) is an irreducible 
polynomial. Show the same for the symmetric case. 
We can use the identity from Proposition 2.56 to determine whether a determinantal 
representation is deﬁnite. 
Theorem 2.58 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](d) be irreducible and hyperbolic with respect to e, 
and let h equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesish = det(M) be a Hermitian determinantal representation of h. If  
some polynomial in script upper H left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisH(M) interlaces h with respect to e, every polynomial in 
script upper H left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisH(M) does, and the matrix upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesisM(e) is (positive or negative) deﬁnite. 
Proof First, suppose that f equals lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline lamdaf = λ∗Madjλ interlaces h, and let g be another element 
of script upper H left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisH(M), say g equals mu Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline mug = μ∗Madjμ where mu element of double struck upper C Superscript dμ ∈Cd. From Proposition 2.56 we see that the 
product fg is nonnegative on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h). Then, by Lemma 2.53, g interlaces h. 
To show that upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesisM(e) is deﬁnite, we ﬁrst show that any two elements f comma gf, g of 
script upper H left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisH(M) have the same sign at the point e. Since h is irreducible, the polynomial fg 
cannot vanish on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h). Otherwise, by the Real Nullstellensatz (see for example 
[10] Theorem 4.5.1) h would divide fg and thus one of the two factors. This is 
impossible for degree reasons. 
By Proposition 2.56, the product fg is nonnegative on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h) and thus strictly 
positive on a dense subset of script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h). Furthermore, since both f and g interlace h,

37
the product 
f g equals left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline lamda right parenthesis left parenthesis mu Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline mu right parenthesisfg = (λ∗Madjλ)(μ∗Madjμ)
must be positive at e. Hence lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Superscript a d j Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesis lamda element of double struck upper Rλ∗Madj(e)λ ∈R has the same sign for all lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript dλ ∈Cd, and 
the Hermitian matrix upper M Superscript a d j Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesisMadj(e) is thus deﬁnite. Hence so is upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals h left parenthesis e right parenthesis left parenthesis upper M Superscript a d j Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesis right parenthesis Superscript negative 1M(e) = h(e)(Madj(e))−1.
⊓⊔
▶Remark 2.59 The converse of Theorem 2.58 also holds, i.e., if upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesisM(e) is deﬁnite, 
then all polynomials from script upper H left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisH(M) interlace h with respect to e, see  [81, Theorem 
3.3]. 
We conclude this section with a useful result, showing that the map taking a 
matrix with linear entries to the determinant is closed when restricted to deﬁnite 
representations, which it need not be in general. 
Lemma 2.60 
Let e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1. The set of all homogeneous polynomials h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](d)

double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesisR[x0, . . . , xn](d). 
Proof First we observe that if h left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals 1h(e) = 1 and h equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesish = det(M) with upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis greater than 0M(e) > 0, then h 
has such a representation upper M primeM′ for which upper M prime left parenthesis e right parenthesisM′(e) is the identity matrix (as seen in the 
proof of Corollary 2.16). 
Now let h Subscript k Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesishk ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](d) be a sequence of polynomials converging to h, 
such that h Subscript k Baseline equals det left parenthesis upper M Superscript left parenthesis k right parenthesis Baseline right parenthesishk = det(M(k)) with upper M Superscript left parenthesis k right parenthesis Baseline equals x 0 upper M 0 Superscript left parenthesis k right parenthesis Baseline plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus x Subscript n Baseline upper M Subscript n Superscript left parenthesis k right parenthesisM(k) = x0M(k)

Hyperbolic Curves and the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem 
The goal of this section is to show that every hyperbolic polynomial in three 
variables (also called a hyperbolic plane curve) possesses a Hermitian determinantal 
representation. This is a weaker statement than the Helton-Vinnikov theorem 
(Theorem 2.44), which says that there even exists a symmetric determinantal 
representation, but it still sufﬁces to characterize three-dimensional spectahedral 
cones and plane spectrahedra. Our proof follows [81]. An alternative proof for the 
Hermitian case, using a different approach, can be found in [34]. 
First of all, we now again speak of curves and convex subsets of the plane, rather 
than of three-dimensional cones. This is because we consider projective varieties 
instead of afﬁne cones, which gives a better geometric picture. We will use three 
variables x comma y comma zx, y, z in this section. A homogeneous polynomial h element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketh ∈R[x, y, z] of 
degree d deﬁnes the projective plane curve

where double struck upper P squared left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisP2(C) is the complex projective plane. We use the letter script upper ZZ to distinguish the 
plane projective curve from the afﬁne cone script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper A cubed left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesis equals double struck upper C cubedVC(h) ⊆A3(C) = C3. 
Recall how points in the projective plane are denoted in homogeneous coordi-
nates: A point in double struck upper P squared left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisP2(C) is an equivalence class of points in double struck upper C cubed minus StartSet 0 EndSetC3\{0} deﬁning the same 
line through the origin. The point in double struck upper P squared left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisP2(C) corresponding to left parenthesis a comma b comma c right parenthesis element of double struck upper C cubed minus StartSet 0 EndSet(a, b, c) ∈C3 \ {0} is 
denoted by left parenthesis a colon b colon c right parenthesis(a : b : c) and we have 
left parenthesis a colon b colon c right parenthesis equals left parenthesis lamda a colon lamda b colon lamda c right parenthesis(a : b : c) = (λa : λb : λc)
for all lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript asteriskλ ∈C∗. In particular, left parenthesis a colon b colon c right parenthesis(a : b : c) is real if and only if lamda a comma lamda b comma lamda cλa, λb, λc are all real 
for some lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript asteriskλ ∈C∗. Thus left parenthesis i colon i colon i right parenthesis(i : i : i) is a real point, while left parenthesis 1 colon 1 colon i right parenthesis(1 : 1 : i) is not. Complex 
conjugation acts on double struck upper P squared left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisP2(C) via the rule 
ModifyingAbove left parenthesis a colon b colon c right parenthesis With quotation dash equals left parenthesis ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash colon ModifyingAbove b With quotation dash colon ModifyingAbove c With quotation dash right parenthesis comma(a : b : c) = (a : b : c),
so that double struck upper P squared left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisP2(R) is exactly the set of ﬁxed points of this action. 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketh ∈R[x, y, z] be homogeneous and irreducible of degree d. We wish to ﬁnd a  
determinantal representation h equals det left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis commah = det(M), where M is a Hermitian matrix of linear 
forms. We will describe a general method for constructing such a representation. 
The idea goes back to the work of Hesse in 1855 [46], which was extended by 
Dixon in 1902 [23]. 
Construction 2.61 Let h comma g element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketh, g ∈R[x, y, z] be homogeneous, with h irreducible, 
degree left parenthesis h right parenthesis equals d commadeg(h) = d, and degree left parenthesis g right parenthesis equals d minus 1deg(g) = d −1. Assume that script upper Z Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection script upper Z Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesis equals normal empty setZR(h) ∩ZR(g) = ∅.

a 11 comma ellipsis comma a Subscript 1 d Baseline element of upper V perioda11, . . . , a1d ∈V.
3. Fix j comma kj, k with 2 less than or slanted equals j less than or slanted equals k less than or slanted equals d2 ⩽j ⩽k ⩽d. The polynomial ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 1 j Baseline a Subscript 1 ka1ja1k vanishes on S. If  S consists 
of d left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesisd(d −1) distinct points, the homogeneous vanishing ideal of S is generated1 
by h and g equals a 11g = a11. Thus we obtain polynomials p comma q element of double struck upper C left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketp, q ∈C[x, y, z] such that 
ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 1 j Baseline a Subscript 1 k Baseline equals p h plus q a 11 perioda1ja1k = ph + qa11.
Since ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 1 j Baseline a Subscript 1 ka1ja1k, h and a 11a11 are all homogeneous, we can assume that p and q are 
also homogeneous, and we ﬁnd degree left parenthesis q right parenthesis equals d minus 1deg(q) = d −1. 
If S contains fewer than d left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesisd(d −1) points, we have to take multiplicities into 
account, but the statement remains true (using Max Noether’s Theorem, see for 
example [29]). 
Put a Subscript j k Baseline equals qajk = q. If j equals kj = k, then a 11a11 and ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 1 j Baseline a Subscript 1 ja1ja1j are both real and we take a Subscript j jajj to be 
real as well. Finally put a Subscript k j Baseline equals ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript j kakj = ajk for j greater than kj > k. 
4. We denote by upper A Subscript gAg the d times dd × d-matrix with entries a Subscript j kajk. By construction, we have 
a 11 a Subscript j k Baseline minus a Subscript 1 k Baseline a Subscript j Baseline 1 Baseline element of left parenthesis h right parenthesis perioda11ajk −a1kaj1 ∈(h).
for all j less than kj < k. Note that upper A Subscript gAg depends not only on h and g, but also on the choice of 
splitting upper S equals upper T union ModifyingAbove upper T With quotation dashS = T ∪T and the choice of basis of V . We will ignore this and denote 
by upper A Subscript gAg any matrix arising in this way. 
Now we are ready for the main result of this section.
1 By the Nullstellensatz, this is equivalent to showing that the ideal generated by g and h is radical. 
This can be deduced from Bézout’s Theorem for curves, or directly from Max Noether’s upper A upper F plus upper B upper GAF +BG

Assume that script upper Z Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection script upper Z Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesis equals normal empty setZR(h) ∩ZR(g) = ∅and let upper A Subscript gAg be as in 
Construction 2.61. Then the following holds: 
1. Every entry of the adjugate matrix left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Baseline right parenthesis Superscript a d j(Ag)adj is divisible by h Superscript d minus 2 Baseline commahd−2, and the 
matrix 
upper M Subscript g Baseline colon equals StartFraction 1 Over h Superscript d minus 2 Baseline EndFraction dot upper A Subscript g Superscript a d jMg :=

det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesis equals gamma h perioddet(Mg) = γ h.
2. Assume that h is strictly hyperbolic with respect to a point e, and that g 
strictly interlaces h. Then gamma not equals 0γ ̸= 0 and the matrix upper M Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesisMg(e) is (positive or 
negative) deﬁnite. 
The proof will make use of the following simple lemma. 
Lemma 2.63 
Let A be a d times dd × d-matrix with entries in a factorial ring R. If  h element of upper Rh ∈R is 
irreducible and divides all 2 times 22 × 2-minors of A, then for every 1 less than or slanted equals k less than or slanted equals d1 ⩽k ⩽d, 
the element h Superscript k minus 1hk−1 divides all k times kk × k-minors of A. 
Proof We prove the statement by induction on k. By hypothesis, the claim holds for 
k less than or slanted equals 2k ⩽2. So assume k greater than 2k > 2 and suppose that h Superscript k minus 2hk−2 divides all left parenthesis k minus 1 right parenthesis times left parenthesis k minus 1 right parenthesis(k −1) × (k −1)-minors 
of A. Let  B be a submatrix of size k times kk×k of A. From upper B Superscript a d j Baseline upper B equals det left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis dot upper I Subscript kBadjB = det(B)·Ik we conclude 
det left parenthesis upper B Superscript a d j Baseline right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis Superscript k minus 1 Baseline perioddet(Badj) = det(B)k−1.
Suppose det left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis equals h Superscript m Baseline qdet(B) = hmq where h does not divide q. Then 
det left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis Superscript k minus 1 Baseline equals h Superscript m left parenthesis k minus 1 right parenthesis Baseline q Superscript k minus 1 Baseline perioddet(B)k−1 = hm(k−1)qk−1.
By assumption h Superscript k minus 2hk−2 divides all entries of upper B Superscript a d jBadj, hence h Superscript k left parenthesis k minus 2 right parenthesishk(k−2) divides its determinant 
det left parenthesis upper B Superscript a d j Baseline right parenthesisdet(Badj), which is det left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis Superscript k minus 1det(B)k−1. Since h is irreducible, h does not divide q Superscript k minus 1qk−1, so  
h Superscript k left parenthesis k minus 2 right parenthesishk(k−2) must divide h Superscript m left parenthesis k minus 1 right parenthesishm(k−1). Then k left parenthesis k minus 2 right parenthesis less than or slanted equals m left parenthesis k minus 1 right parenthesisk(k −2) ⩽m(k −1), which implies that k minus 1 less than or slanted equals mk −1 ⩽
m, as claimed.

Proof of Theorem 2.62 
(1) By construction, the 2 times 22×2 minors of upper A Subscript gAg of the form a 11 a Subscript j k minus a Subscript 1 k Baseline a Subscript j Baseline 1a11ajk−a1kaj1 are divisible 
by h. Therefore, if u element of script upper Z Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisu ∈ZC(h) is a point with a 11 left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0a11(u) ̸= 0, we can conclude that 
every row of upper A Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesisAg(u) is a multiple of the ﬁrst, so that upper A Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesisAg(u) has rank 1. Since a 11a11
is not divisible by h, it follows that a 11 left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0a11(u) ̸= 0 holds on a Zariski-dense subset 
of script upper Z Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisZC(h). So all the 2 times 22×2 minors of upper A Subscript gAg are divisible by h. Since h is irreducible 
in double struck upper C left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketC[x, y, z], this implies that all left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis times left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis(d −1) × (d −1)-minors of upper A Subscript gAg are divisible 
by h Superscript d minus 2hd−2, by Lemma 2.63. 
The entries of upper A Subscript g Superscript a d jAadj
g
have degree left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis squared comma(d −1)2, and h has degree d, so that 
upper M Subscript g Baseline equals StartFraction 1 Over h Superscript d minus 2 Baseline EndFraction dot upper A Subscript g Superscript a d jMg =

hd−2 · Aadj
g
has entries of degree 
left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis squared minus d left parenthesis d minus 2 right parenthesis equals 1 period(d −1)2 −d(d −2) = 1.
Furthermore, by Lemma 2.63, det left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Ag) is divisible by h Superscript d minus 1hd−1. So  det left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Baseline right parenthesis equals q h Superscript d minus 1det(Ag) =
qhd−1 for some q element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracket commaq ∈R[x, y, z], and we obtain 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesis 2nd Column equals det left parenthesis h Superscript 2 minus d Baseline upper A Subscript g Superscript a d j Baseline right parenthesis equals h Superscript d left parenthesis 2 minus d right parenthesis Baseline det left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Superscript a d j Baseline right parenthesis equals h Superscript d left parenthesis 2 minus d right parenthesis Baseline det left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Baseline right parenthesis Superscript d minus 1 Baseline 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column equals h Superscript d left parenthesis 2 minus d right parenthesis Baseline q Superscript d minus 1 Baseline h Superscript left parenthesis d minus 1 right parenthesis squared Baseline equals q Superscript d minus 1 Baseline h period EndLayoutdet(Mg) = det(h2−dAadj
g ) = hd(2−d) det(Aadj
g ) = hd(2−d) det(Ag)d−1
= hd(2−d)qd−1h(d−1)2 = qd−1h.
Since det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Mg) has degree d, we see that q is a constant and we take gamma equals q Superscript d minus 1γ = qd−1. 
(2) To show that det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Mg) is not the zero-polynomial, we begin by showing that 
lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamdaλ∗Agλ
is not the zero-polynomial, for any lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript d minus StartSet 0 EndSetλ ∈Cd \ {0}. As argued in the proof of (1), 
the matrix upper A Subscript gAg has rank one at all points of script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis commaVC(h), and for every lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript d minus StartSet 0 EndSetλ ∈Cd \ {0}
we have by construction 
a 11 dot left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamda right parenthesis minus left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline e 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis ModifyingAbove lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline e 1 With quotation dash right parenthesis element of left parenthesis h right parenthesis perioda11 · (λ∗Agλ) −(λ∗Age1)(λ∗Age1) ∈(h).
(2.3) 
If lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamdaλ∗Agλ is identically zero, we conclude that lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline e 1λ∗Age1 vanishes on script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVC(h). 
Since h has degree d and lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline e 1λ∗Age1 has degree d minus 1d −1, lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline e 1λ∗Age1 must then vanish 
identically as well (again using Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz). This contradicts the 
linear independence of the polynomials ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 11 Baseline comma ellipsis comma ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript 1 d Baselinea11, . . . , a1d. 
Now suppose that the claim is false and that det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Mg) is identically zero. 
From the proof of (1) it is clear that det left parenthesis upper A Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Ag) is then zero as well. In particular, 
the determinant of upper A Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesisAg(e) is zero, so there is some nonzero vector lamda element of double struck upper C Superscript d minus StartSet 0 EndSetλ ∈Cd \ {0}
in its kernel, and lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesis lamdaλ∗Ag(e)λ is thus also zero. But we have just shown that the 
polynomial lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamdaλ∗Agλ is nonzero, and Eq. (2.3) shows that the product a 11 dot left parenthesis lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamda right parenthesisa11·(λ∗Agλ)

is nonnegative on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisVR(h). By Lemma 2.53, lamda Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A Subscript g Baseline lamdaλ∗Agλ therefore interlaces h. Thus 
this polynomial cannot vanish at the point e commae, and so the determinant det left parenthesis upper M Subscript g Baseline right parenthesisdet(Mg) is 
indeed not identically zero. 
What remains to show is that upper M Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesisMg(e) is deﬁnite. To do this, we show that 
upper A Subscript gAg is the adjugate matrix of upper M Subscript gMg. By construction, upper M Subscript g Baseline equals h Superscript 2 minus d Baseline dot upper A Subscript g Superscript a d jMg = h2−d · Aadj

multiple of e 1 Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M Subscript g Superscript a d j Baseline e 1 commae∗

⊓⊔
Corollary 2.64 
Every hyperbolic polynomial in three variables possesses a deﬁnite Hermitian 
determinantal representation. 
Proof Suppose h element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracketh ∈R[x, y, z] is irreducible and strictly hyperbolic with respect to 
e. Then the directional derivative partial differential Subscript e Baseline h∂eh strictly interlaces h and can be used an input 
in Construction 2.61. By Theorem 2.62 (2), this will result in a deﬁnite Hermitian 
determinantal representation of h. If  h is strictly hyperbolic but not irreducible, then 
each irreducible factor of h is strictly hyperbolic and we can build a Hermitian 
determinantal representation of h as a block matrix from the representations of all 
factors. 
In general, if h element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x, y, z](d) is (not necessarily strictly) hyperbolic with respect 
to e and h left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals 1h(e) = 1, by Exercise  2.50 (2) there exists a sequence of strictly hyperbolic 
polynomials 
h Subscript k Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma y comma z right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesishk ∈R[x, y, z](d)
(with respect to e) and h Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals 1 commahk(e) = 1, converging to h. Now each h Subscript khk has a Hermitian 
determinantal representation, hence so does h by Lemma 2.60.

Corollary 2.65 
Every three-dimensional hyperbolicity cone is spectrahedral.

Let us now use the existence of determinantal representations in dimension three 
to prove some already announced geometric properties of general hyperbolicity 
cones. These results were ﬁrst proven in [30], with a more elementary but also more 
technical proof. 
Corollary 2.66 
Every hyperbolicity cone is a convex cone. 
Proof Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript left parenthesis d right parenthesish ∈R[x](d) be hyperbolic with respect to e. For  u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisu ∈Ce(h) and alpha greater than 0α > 0, 
the roots of h left parenthesis alpha u plus t e right parenthesish(αu+te) are those of h left parenthesis u plus alpha Superscript negative 1 Baseline t e right parenthesish(u+α−1te), which are just the roots of h left parenthesis u minus t e right parenthesish(u−te)
multiplied with alphaα. So it is clear that alpha u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisαu ∈Ce(h). 
Given two points u comma v element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisu, v ∈Ce(h), let  V be the three-dimensional subspace spanned 
by e comma u comma ve, u, v. Then ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper VCe(h) ∩V is the hyperbolicity cone of h vertical bar Subscript upper V Baseline commah|V , which is spectrahedral 
by Corollary 2.65. In particular it is a convex cone, and therefore contains u plus vu+v. 
⊓⊔
Corollary 2.67 
If h is hyperbolic with respect to e, then it is hyperbolic with respect to any 
interior point of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h). 
Proof Using arguments as in Corollary 2.16, this is easy to see if h has a deﬁnite 
Hermitian determinantal representation, and by Corollary 2.65 it therefore holds 
for three-dimensional hyperbolicity cones. The general case can be reduced to the 
three-dimensional one as in the proof of Corollary 2.66 above. 
⊓⊔
Finally, let us see an example. Carrying out Construction 2.61 in practice is not 
an easy matter. The following example is taken directly from [81, Example 4.11]. 
Example 2.68 We apply Construction 2.61 to the quartic

left parenthesis 0 colon 1 colon 1 right parenthesis(0 : 1 : 1) and left parenthesis 0 colon negative 1 colon 1 right parenthesis(0 : −1 : 1), so that h is not strictly hyperbolic. But the construction will still 
work, and this happens to simplify the explicit computations considerably. Figure 2.9 shows 
the real curve in the plane left brace x equals 1 right brace{x = 1}.

Hyperbolic Polynomials from Graphs 
In this section we will ﬁrst explain an interesting method to produce hyperbolic 
polynomials with deﬁnite determinantal representations, using the Matrix-Tree 
Theorem by Kirchhoff [51], initially presented already in 1847. Is has been used in 
the context of hyperbolic polynomials for example in [15,16]. We will then present 
Brändén’s result [15] on hyperbolicity cones of elementary symmetric polynomials. 
Let upper G equals left parenthesis upper V comma upper E right parenthesisG = (V, E) be a ﬁnite undirected multigraph without loops. Formally, this 
means that E and V are ﬁnite sets, and a map

into the 2-element subsets of V is also given (specifying the two distinct endpoints 
of each edge). Informally, it means that the ﬁnitely many vertices are connected 
by edges, each edge connecting two different vertices, but there might be (ﬁnitely 
many) multiple edges between any two vertices. The informal approach is sufﬁcient 
here, and we thus suppress phiϕ from the notation. We will also just say “multigraph” 
instead of “ﬁnite undirected multigraph without loops” from now on. 
Deﬁnition 2.69 
Let upper G equals left parenthesis upper V comma upper E right parenthesisG = (V, E) be a multigraph. 
1. A subset upper T subset of or equal to upper ET ⊆E is called a spanning tree of G if it contains each vertex of G

Proof In a ﬁrst step assume that G is a tree. We prove h Subscript upper G Baseline equals det left parenthesis upper L Subscript upper G Superscript v Baseline right parenthesishG = det(Lv
G) by induction 
on the number of vertices of G. For one or two vertices, the statement is obvious. 
For the induction step, let w be a leaf different from v in G, and denote by upper G primeG′ the 
tree obtained by deleting w (and its adjacent edge e primee′). If det left parenthesis upper L Subscript upper G Superscript v Baseline right parenthesisdet(Lv
G) is computed by 
Laplace expansion along the row indexed by w, a short calculation shows 
det left parenthesis upper L Subscript upper G Superscript v Baseline right parenthesis equals x Subscript e Sub Superscript prime Subscript Baseline det left parenthesis upper L Subscript upper G Sub Superscript prime Subscript Superscript v Baseline right parenthesis equals x Subscript e Sub Superscript prime Subscript Baseline h Subscript upper G Sub Superscript prime Subscript Baseline equals h Subscript upper G Baseline commadet(Lv

G′) = xe′hG′ = hG,
where we have used the induction hypothesis for upper G primeG′ for the second equality.

the edges of G, and let I be the weighted incidence matrix of G, by which we mean

We continue in this way until we have constructed a tree of height k. The vertices 
at height d (seen from the root alphaα) are labeled with the sequences of length d of 
numbers between 0 and n, in which no number appears twice. The edge leading to 
such a vertex (from height d minus 1d −1) is labeled left parenthesis k minus d plus 1 right parenthesis factorial x Subscript j Baseline(k −d + 1)!xj, when j is the last entry 
of the vertex label. 
Finally, the left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis factorial slash left parenthesis n plus 1 minus k right parenthesis factorial(n+1)!/(n+1−k)! leaves of the tree are all connected by edges to a 
ﬁnal vertex omegaω. Such an edge is labeled by the ﬁrst elementary symmetric polynomial 
s 1 commas1, but in only those variables whose indices do not appear in the label of the 
corresponding leaf. 
We are now ready to state and prove the main result from [15]. 
Theorem 2.77

and this cone is thus a spectrahedron.

To compute the spanning tree polynomial of upper B Subscript kBk recursively, we deﬁne the graph 
upper B Subscript k comma rBk,r for r greater than or slanted equals kr ⩾k almost as upper B Subscript kBk, but with a slightly different labeling of edges. The edges 
leading from height d minus 1d −1 to d are labeled left parenthesis r minus d plus 1 right parenthesis factorial x Subscript j Baseline(r −d + 1)!xj, instead of left parenthesis k minus d plus 1 right parenthesis factorial x Subscript j Baseline(k −d + 1)!xj

Note that clearly upper B Subscript k comma k Baseline equals upper B Subscript kBk,k = Bk holds. Now note that upper B Subscript k comma rBk,r is constructed from upper B Subscript k minus 1 comma rBk−1,r by 
replacing each of the ﬁnal edges (leading to omegaω) by a certain edge-labeled diamond, 
just as in Remark 2.72. On the level of spanning tree polynomials, we thus obtain 
the one of upper B Subscript k comma rBk,r from the one of upper B Subscript k minus 1 comma rBk−1,r by multiplying with 
product Underscript j not an element of v Endscripts left parenthesis r minus k plus 1 right parenthesis factorial left parenthesis x Subscript j Baseline plus q Subscript r minus k plus 1 Superscript v j Baseline right parenthesis

Derivative Cones 
In this section we collect some results on derivative cones of hyperbolicity cones. 
For a polynomial h which is hyperbolic in direction e, we denote by partial differential Subscript e Baseline h∂eh its 
derivative in direction e, and call 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript e Baseline h right parenthesisCe(∂eh)
the derivative cone of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) (although strictly speaking this is a slight abuse of 
notation, since the derivative cone depends on h and not only on the cone ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h)). 
Of course this process can be repeated and gives rise to the higher order derivative 
cones 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript e Superscript k Baseline h right parenthesis periodCe(∂k
e h).
In Exercise 2.49 it is shown that the derivative cone always contains the original 
cone, so any such cone admits an increasing sequence of higher order derivative 
cones. 
A straightforward consequence of Theorem 2.77 is that all higher order derivative 
cones of polyhedral cones are spectrahedral:

so the statement is clear from Theorem 2.77, by substituting the script l Subscript iℓi for the variables

which will prove that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript e Baseline h right parenthesisCe(∂eh) is indeed a spectrahedron. 
Since the conditions on both sides of (2.7) are invariant under orthogonal conju-
gations, we can restrict to diagonal matrices upper M equals d i a g left parenthesis lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisM = diag(λ1, . . . , λs) for proving the 
equivalence. The condition on the left then just means that lamda equals left parenthesis lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisλ = (λ1, . . . , λs) belongs 
to the hyperbolicity cone of the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree s minus 1s −1
(cp. Sect. 2.6). To examine the condition on the right in (2.7) we choose an explicit 
basis of the space of symmetric matrices with vanishing trace, and look at the matrix 
polynomial from (2.8). We denote by upper E Subscript i jEij the matrix with a 1 in the left parenthesis i comma j right parenthesis(i, j)-entry and 
zeros elsewhere. Then the matrices

form a basis as desired. For upper M equals d i a g left parenthesis lamda right parenthesisM = diag(λ) a straightforward computation shows

So for this particular basis, the matrix polynomial from (2.8) has a block-diagonal 
form, and is thus positive semideﬁnite if and only if the block indexed by the upper S Subscript i jSij
alone, and the block indexed by the upper D Subscript rDr alone, is positive semideﬁnite. The second 
block is precisely of the form of Example 2.71 (3), and thus exactly states that lamdaλ
must be in the hyperbolicity cone of the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree 
s minus 1s −1, i.e., upper M element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript e Baseline h right parenthesisM ∈Ce(∂eh). The ﬁrst block is even diagonal and yields the conditions 
lamda Subscript i Baseline plus lamda Subscript j Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0λi + λj ⩾0 for all i less than ji < j. But already from the diagonal of the second block we see 
that lamda Subscript i Baseline plus lamda Subscript i plus 1 Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0λi + λi+1 ⩾0 holds for all 1 less than or slanted equals i less than s1 ⩽i < s, whenever lamdaλ is in the hyperbolicity cone 
of the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree s minus 1s −1. Since this hyperbolicity 
cone is invariant under coordinate permutations, this shows that the ﬁrst block is 
automatically positive semideﬁnite, if the second is. This ﬁnishes the proof.

Free Spectrahedra 
Some interesting facts about spectrahedra and their deﬁning matrix polynomials can 
only be learned when looking at their free (that means non-commutative) extensions. 
They result by evaluating linear matrix polynomials at tuples of Hermitian matrices, 
instead of just tuples of real numbers. Since matrices do not commute in general 
(i.e., are free of the burden of commutativity), this accounts for the name free 
spectrahedra. In this section we will introduce the most important concepts and 
explain some results. We will restrict to convex cones throughout, but it must be 
pointed out that, while any nonzero number can be rescaled to 1, not every nonzero 
Hermitian matrix can be rescaled to the identity matrix. This makes passing between 
homogeneous and non-homogeneous settings a little more difﬁcult. In this section 
we will also mostly use Hermitian matrices, since the closely related theory of 
operator systems always works in the complex setting. 
Throughout this section, let upper M equals x 0 upper M 0 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus x Subscript n Baseline upper M Subscript nM = x0M0 + · · · + xnMn be a homogeneous and 
Hermitian linear matrix polynomial of size s, with 
upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals e 0 upper M 0 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus e Subscript n Baseline upper M Subscript n Baseline equals upper I Subscript sM(e) = e0M0 + · · · + enMn = Is

upper M 0 comma ellipsis comma upper M Subscript n BaselineM0, . . . , Mn are linearly independent (we have seen in Exercise 2.10 that this is 
not much of a restriction).

▶Remark 2.84 
1. The ﬁrst level script upper S 1 left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS1(M) coincides with the spectrahedron script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) as considered 
throughout this book so far. This is because upper H e r 1 equals double struck upper R commaHer1 = R, and the tensor product 
is just scalar multiplication in this case. 
2. We have deﬁned script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS∞(M) as a disjoint union, so there is no embedding of 
matrix spaces involved. Perhaps it would be a cleaner approach to deﬁne 
script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS∞(M) as the sequence of all script upper S Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisSk(M), but this makes later notation more 
opaque.

In the general context of free semialgebraic geometry this often makes sense, 
but for free spectrahedra it does not add anything relevant. 
Some important but easy to prove properties of free spectrahedra are collected in 
the following lemma.

Exercise 2.86 
Prove Lemma 2.85.
▶Remark 2.87 The properties of Lemma 2.85 can be summarized by saying that 
script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS∞(M) is an abstract operator system (see for example [79, Chapter 13]). But 
it can also be understood as a concrete operator system. Indeed the space 
upper V colon equals s p a n Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper M 0 comma ellipsis comma upper M Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisV := spanC (M0, . . . , Mn) ⊆Mats(C)
contains upper I Subscript sIs and is closed under taking adjoints (since the upper M Subscript iMi are Hermitian). 
This is already the deﬁnition of a concrete operator system. Any such system 
upper V subset of or equal to upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisV ⊆Mats(C) comes equipped with its set of positive elements of higher level in 
upper M a t Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesis circled times upper V subset of or equal to upper M a t Subscript k s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisMatk(C)⊗V ⊆Matks(C), and in our case these coincide exactly with the higher 
levels script upper S Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisSk(M). 
Every abstract operator system can be realized as a concrete operator system on 
a possibly inﬁnite-dimensional space of operators, by the Choi-Effros Theorem 
[79]. But what makes free spectrahedra special (among general abstract operator 
systems) is that they have a concrete realization in upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisMats(C), i.e., as operators on 
a ﬁnite-dimensional space. 
As we will demonstrate in Theorem 2.96 below, they can also be seen as free 
halfspaces, at least in the sense of separation theory. 
Example 2.88 This example is from [40]. It shows that even if two matrix polynomials 
upper M comma upper NM, N deﬁne the same classical spectrahedron 
script upper S 1 left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis upper N right parenthesis equals script upper S 1 left parenthesis upper N right parenthesis commaS1(M) = S(M) = S(N) = S1(N),
their free spectrahedra might still differ at higher levels. Consider 
upper M equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column x 0 minus x 1 2nd Column x 2 2nd Row 1st Column x 2 2nd Column x 0 plus x 1 EndMatrix and upper N equals Start 3 By 3 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column x 0 2nd Column 0 3rd Column x 1 2nd Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column x 0 3rd Column x 2 3rd Row 1st Column x 1 2nd Column x 2 3rd Column x 0 EndMatrix commaM =

The general inclusion script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisS∞(M) ⊆S∞(N) will be proven in Example 2.90 below. 
The following result is from [40], and based on Choi’s Representation Theorem 
for completely positive maps. 
Theorem 2.89 
Let upper M comma upper NM, N be homogeneous linear matrix polynomials of size s and t, with 
upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals upper I Subscript sM(e) = Is and upper N left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals upper I Subscript tN(e) = It for some e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1. Assume the upper M Subscript iMi are linearly 
independent (the upper N Subscript iNi not necessarily). Then the following are equivalent: 
1. . S∞(M) ⊆S∞(N).
2. .St(M) ⊆St(N). 
3. There exist ﬁnitely many upper V Subscript j Baseline element of upper M a t Subscript s times t Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisVj ∈Mats×t(C) with sigma summation Underscript j Endscripts upper V Subscript j Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M upper V Subscript j Baseline equals upper N period

In case this is true, (3) holds with at most s dot ts · t many matrices upper V Subscript jVj.

then sigma summation Underscript i equals 0 Overscript n Endscripts upper A Subscript i Baseline circled times upper M Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0 comman

Since the upper M Subscript iMi are linearly independent, phiϕ is well-deﬁned. From upper M left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals upper I Subscript sM(e) = Is and 
upper N left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals upper I Subscript tN(e) = It we obtain phi left parenthesis upper I Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis equals upper I Subscript tϕ(Is) = It, i.e., phiϕ is a unital map. Since all upper M Subscript iMi and upper N Subscript iNi are

script upper S 1 left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S 1 left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisS1(M) ⊆S1(N) we deduce that phiϕ maps positive matrices from V to positive 
matrices in upper M a t Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisMatt(C), i.e., phiϕ is a positive map. But in fact phiϕ is even completely 
positive, which means the following: For each k greater than or slanted equals 1k ⩾1 consider the asterisk∗-linear unital

This is just a  
straightforward reformulation of our assumption script upper S Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesis periodSt(M) ⊆St(N). So phi Subscript tϕt is a positive 
map, and by [79], Theorem 6.1, this already implies that each phi Subscript kϕk is a positive map 
(meaning that phiϕ is completely positive, by deﬁnition). By Arveson’s Extension 
Theorem (see [79], Theorem 7.5), the map phiϕ extends from V to a completely 
positive map on the whole of upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisMats(C). By Choi’s Representation Theorem for

proposed in [6], as a tractable sufﬁcient condition for containment (see also 
[40]). Theorem 2.89 reveals that this approach in fact detects containment of 
free spectrahedra. Since containment at level one does in general not imply 
containment at higher levels (see Example 2.90), it also explains why the 
approach may fail to detect containment of classical spectrahedra. 
There are several cases in which containment of classical spectrahedra does 
imply containment of free spectrahedra (and thus condition (3) from Theorem 2.89), 
see [28,50] for more information: 
Corollary 2.92 
Let upper M comma upper NM, N be homogeneous linear matrix polynomials with script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisS(M) ⊆S(N). If  
either script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) is a simplex cone, or N is diagonal (so that script upper S left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisS(N) is polyhedral), 
then 
script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesis periodS∞(M) ⊆S∞(N).
Proof First, assume that script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) is a simplex cone. After a linear transformation we 
can assume that script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals double struck upper R Subscript plus Superscript n plus 1S(M) = Rn+1

we thus obtain upper N Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0Ni ⩾0 for all i. Now  take upper A equals left parenthesis upper A 0 comma ellipsis comma upper A Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis element of script upper S Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisA = (A0, . . . , An) ∈Sk(M) and v element of double struck upper C Superscript kv ∈Ck.

which implies upper A Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0Ai ⩾0 for all i. So  sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts upper A Subscript i circled times upper N Subscript i
i Ai ⊗Ni is also positive semideﬁnite, which 
implies upper A element of script upper S Subscript k Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisA ∈Sk(N).

so 0 less than or slanted equals script l Subscript j Baseline left parenthesis v Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A v right parenthesis equals v Superscript asterisk Baseline script l Subscript j Baseline left parenthesis upper A right parenthesis v period0 ⩽ℓj(v∗Av) = v∗ℓj(A)v. This implies script l Subscript j Baseline left parenthesis upper A right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0ℓj(A) ⩾0 for all j equals 1 comma ellipsis comma dj = 1, . . . , d, and 
thus

Linear Matrix Inequalities and Spectrahedra
We can use the theory of free spectrahedra to recover one of the main results of 
[88] and [7], saying that spectrahedra are polyhedra only in the obvious cases: 
Corollary 2.93 
Let M be a homogeneous linear matrix polynomial of size s, as speciﬁed at the 
beginning of this section. Assume that script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracket Subscript left parenthesis 1 right parenthesisℓ∈R[x0, . . . , xn](1) is a linear form 
that exposes a face of script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) of codimension 1. Then there is some invertible 
upper A element of upper G upper L Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisA ∈GLs(C), and a linear matrix polynomial upper M primeM′ of size s minus 1s −1, with 
upper A Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M upper A equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column script l 2nd Column 0 2nd Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column upper M Superscript prime Baseline EndMatrix periodA∗MA =
 ℓ0
0 M′

.
Hence if script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M) is polyhedral, there is some invertible upper A element of upper G upper L Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisA ∈GLs(C) with 
upper A Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M upper A equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column upper D 2nd Column 0 2nd Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column upper M double prime EndMatrixA∗MA =
 D
0
0 M′′

where D is diagonal and script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis upper D right parenthesisS(M) = S(D). 
Proof By Theorem 2.89 (2)right double arrow⇒(3), the inclusion script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper S left parenthesis script l right parenthesisS(M) ⊆S(ℓ) implies the existence 
of v Subscript j Baseline element of double struck upper C Superscript kvj ∈Ck with sigma summation Underscript j Endscripts v Subscript j Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M v Subscript j Baseline equals script l
j v∗
j Mvj = ℓ(note that we can assume script l left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals 1ℓ(e) = 1). We can 
assume v 1 Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M v 1 not equals 0v∗
1Mv1 ̸= 0, and after an invertible linear transformation also that v 1v1 is the 
ﬁrst standard basis vector. So 
upper M 11 plus sigma summation Underscript j greater than or slanted equals 2 Endscripts v Subscript j Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M v Subscript j Baseline equals script l periodM11 +

j⩾2
v∗
j Mvj = ℓ.
Since script lℓvanishes along a face of codimension 1 of script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M), 0 not equals upper M 110 ̸= M11 must vanish there 
as well, which implies upper M 11 equals script l commaM11 = ℓ, without loss of generality. Looking at all 2 times 22 × 2
minors of M that involve upper M 11M11, we see that all upper M Subscript 1 j Baseline equals ModifyingAbove upper M Subscript j Baseline 1 Baseline With quotation dashM1j = Mj1 must also vanish on that 
face, and they are thus also scalar multiples of script lℓ. Using upper M 11M11, one can now eliminate 
all the upper M Subscript 1 jM1j and upper M Subscript j Baseline 1Mj1 symmetrically, and the resulting matrix polynomial is of the 
desired form. The second claim follows by simply iterating this process. 
⊓⊔
Note that the ﬁrst step in the previous proof could also be done with a more 
elementary argument, for example as used in the proof of Theorem 3.5 (8) below. 
Using results on free spectrahedra is much less elementary, but avoids a lot of 
technical arguments. 
One would like to completely classify linear matrix polynomials that deﬁne the 
same spectrahedron. As we have seen already, this is harder than one might suspect, 
since the free spectrahedra impose important conditions that cannot be seen at level 
one alone. However, classifying linear matrix polynomials deﬁning the same free 
spectrahedron is easier. The following notion and result was also proven in [40].

Deﬁnition 2.94 
A matrix polynomial M of size s is minimally free deﬁning if it is not possible to 
ﬁnd a unitary upper A element of normal upper U Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesis commaA ∈Us(C), such that 
upper A Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M upper A equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column upper M 1 2nd Column 0 2nd Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column upper M 2 EndMatrixA∗MA =

with upper M 1M1 of size less than s< s, and script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M 1 right parenthesis equals script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS∞(M1) = S∞(M). 
Theorem 2.95 
Let upper M comma upper NM, N be homogeneous linear matrix polynomials as speciﬁed at the 
beginning of this section, and assume both are minimally free deﬁning. If 
script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals script upper S Subscript normal infinity Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesisS∞(M) = S∞(N), then M and N are of the same size and unitarily 
equivalent. 
Proof We only give a rough idea of the proof and refer to [40] for details. 
We let upper V equals s p a n Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper M 0 comma ellipsis comma upper M Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisV = spanC (M0, . . . , Mn) ⊆Mats(C), upper W equals s p a n Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper N 0 comma ellipsis comma upper N Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper M a t Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesis commaW = spanC (N0, . . . , Nn) ⊆
Matt(C), and consider the unital asterisk∗-linear map 
phi colon upper V right arrow upper W semicolon upper M Subscript i Baseline right arrow from bar upper N Subscript i Baseline periodϕ : V →W; Mi →Ni.
Then phiϕ is an isomorphism, and, as in the proof of Theorem 2.89, we see that both 
phiϕ and phi Superscript negative 1ϕ−1 are completely positive. After checking the technial assumptions, we 
can apply [2], Theorem 2.2.5, and extend phiϕ to a asterisk∗-homomorphism pi colon upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesis right arrow upper M a t Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisπ : Mats(C) →
Matt(C). This implies s less than or slanted equals ts ⩽t, and by symmetry thus s equals ts = t. It is well-known that 
each unital asterisk∗-homomorphism on upper M a t Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisMats(C) is of the form upper A right arrow from bar upper U Superscript asterisk Baseline upper A upper UA →U∗AU for some 
unitary normal upper U element of normal upper U Subscript s Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper C right parenthesisU ∈Us(C), which ﬁnishes the proof. 
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section with a version of the free separation theorem of [24]. It 
shows that free spectrahedra play the same role in free convexity as halfspaces do 
in classical convexity theory.

then there exists a homogeneous linear matrix polynomial M of size k, such

Spectrahedral Shadows 
In this chapter we introduce the notion of a spectrahedral shadow, and examine 
these sets thoroughly. They are still feasible sets for semideﬁnite programming, 
and in contrast to spectrahedra, many of the standard constructions from convexity 
theory can be applied to them. We explain how general semialgebraic sets can be 
approximated by spectrahedral shadows and how these methods provide criteria 
for being a spectrahedral shadow for many sets. While all convex semialgebraic 
sets in the plane are spectrahedral shadows, we also provide examples of convex 
semialgebraic sets that cannot be realized as a projection of a spectrahedron. 
3.1
Spectrahedral Shadows 
A spectrahedral shadow or projected spectrahedron is the image of a spectrahedron 
under an afﬁne-linear map. Such a shadow is clearly again convex, and also 
semialgebraic (by the Projection Theorem 1.2) but need not be a spectrahedron. 
One obvious reason is that a spectrahedral shadow is not necessarily closed, 
since linear maps are not closed. For example, the projection of the spectrahe-

desired representation of P. 
⊓⊔
A representation of P as in Lemma 3.4 is also called a lifted linear matrix 
inequality representation, an  extended formulation or simply a semideﬁnite repre-
sentation. If  upper M left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesisM(x, y) is a linear matrix polynomial as above, we will often denote 
the projection double struck upper R Superscript n plus m Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nRn+m →Rn onto the ﬁrst coordinates by pi Subscript xπx. Thus the lifted 
representation will be denoted by 
upper P equals pi Subscript x Baseline script upper S left parenthesis upper M left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis right parenthesis or just upper P equals pi Subscript x Baseline script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis periodP = πxS(M(x, y))
or just
P = πxS(M).

Spectrahedral Shadows
While spectrahedra are very special convex sets, it is still unclear which 
distinguishing features spectrahedral shadows have in general (beyond the obvious 
of being convex and semialgebraic). It was asked in [65] whether every convex 
semialgebraic set is a spectrahedral shadow. This also became known as the Helton-
Nie conjecture [41]. This conjecture was proven by Scheiderer for two-dimensional 
sets [98], but later disproven in higher dimensions [99]. Helton and Nie [41, 42] 
proved a series of results which can be summed up as saying that any convex 
semialgebraic set with sufﬁciently regular boundary is a spectrahedral shadow. 
Understanding and proving some of these results will be one of our main goals 
in the following sections. 
We will start by establishing some basic properties of spectrahedral shadows. In 
particular, we will show that many of the usual operations preserving convexity also 
preserve the property of being a spectrahedral shadow. 
3.2
Operations on Spectrahedral Shadows 
The following theorem contains many of the constructions that can be performed 
with convex semialgebraic sets, and states that all these operations preserve the 
property of being a spectrahedral shadow. Item (6) was ﬁrst proven in [41], see also 
[64, 71]. Items (8), (9) and thus (10) are already implicitly contained in the duality 
theory of semideﬁnite programming (see for example [87]), and (11) is from [67]. 
Theorem 3.5 
Let upper P comma upper Q subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nP, Q ⊆Rn, upper R subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript mR ⊆Rm be spectrahedral shadows. Then the following sets 
are again spectrahedral shadows: 
1. Intersection: upper P intersection upper Q periodP ∩Q.
2. Cartesian product: upper P times upper R periodP × R.
3. Afﬁne-linear images and preimages of upper P periodP.
4. Minkowski sum: upper P plus upper Q periodP + Q.
5. Conic hull: c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis periodcone(P).
6. Convex hull: c o n v left parenthesis upper P union upper Q right parenthesis periodconv(P ∪Q).
7. Projective transformations of P.

(2) Clearly, upper P times double struck upper R Superscript m Baseline equals left brace left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus m Baseline vertical bar there exists w element of double struck upper R Superscript r Baseline colon upper M left parenthesis u comma w right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right braceP × Rm = {(u, v) ∈Rn+m | ∃w ∈Rr : M(u, w) ⩾0} is a 
spectrahedral shadow, and so is double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times upper RRn × R. Therefore upper P times upper R equals left parenthesis upper P times double struck upper R Superscript m Baseline right parenthesis intersection left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times upper R right parenthesisP × R = (P × Rm) ∩
(Rn × R) is a spectrahedral shadow, using (1). 
(3) For afﬁne-linear images, this is clear by deﬁnition. For the preimage of P under 
the afﬁne-linear map phi colon double struck upper R Superscript l Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nϕ : Rl →Rn, consider the set 
StartSet left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis element of double struck upper R Superscript l Baseline times upper P vertical bar phi left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals v EndSet comma{(u, v) ∈Rl × P | ϕ(u) = v},
which is a is a spectrahedral shadow, using (1) and (2). Clearly phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisϕ−1(P) is the 
projection onto the ﬁrst factor, so the claim follows. 
(4) Let sigma colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nσ : Rn × Rn →Rn be the linear map left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis right arrow from bar u plus v(u, v) →u + v. Then upper P plus upper Q equals sigma left parenthesis upper P times upper Q right parenthesisP + Q =

which will prove the statement, using (1) and (3) (or directly Exercise 2.6). To 
see “subset of or equal to⊆” in  (3.1), take  u element of c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisu ∈cone(P). If  u equals 0u = 0, it clearly belongs to the set on 
the right, so assume u not equals 0u ̸= 0. Since P is already convex, there exists lamda greater than 0λ > 0 and 
u prime element of upper Pu′ ∈P with u equals lamda u primeu = λu′. There further exists v prime element of double struck upper R Superscript rv′ ∈Rr with upper M left parenthesis u prime comma v Superscript prime Baseline right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0M(u′, v′) ⩾0, since 
u prime element of upper Pu′ ∈P. Multiplying this with lamdaλ proves left parenthesis u comma lamda v Superscript prime Baseline comma lamda comma mu right parenthesis element of script upper S left parenthesis upper M overTilde right parenthesis(u, λv′, λ, μ) ∈S( 

Clearly muμ can be chosen large enough to fulﬁll lamda mu greater than or slanted equals u Subscript i Superscript 2λμ ⩾u2

set on the right in (3.1). 
For “superset of or equal to⊇” let  left parenthesis u comma v comma lamda comma mu right parenthesis(u, v, λ, μ) belong to script upper S left parenthesis upper M overTilde right parenthesis intersection script upper S left parenthesis upper L 1 right parenthesis intersection midline horizontal ellipsis intersection script upper S left parenthesis upper L Subscript n Baseline right parenthesisS( 

we clearly obtain upper M left parenthesis u divided by lamda comma v divided by lamda right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 commaM(u/λ, v/λ) ⩾0, so u divided by lamda element of pi Subscript x Baseline script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals upper Pu/λ ∈πxS(M) = P and thus u element of c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisu ∈
cone(P). If  lamda equals 0λ = 0, from the conditions in script upper S left parenthesis upper L Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisS(Li) it follows that u equals 0u = 0, which 
also belongs to c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesiscone(P). 
(6) Let upper P overTilde comma upper Q overTilde subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1

Q ⊆Rn+1 be the conic homogenizations of P and Q, as described in 
Remark 2.31 (1). By (5) both are spectrahedral shadows, and so is upper C colon equals upper P overTilde plus upper Q overTilde commaC := 

which proves the statement, using (3). 
(7) A projective transformation of P can be realized by embedding double struck upper R Superscript nRn as an 
afﬁne subspace into double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1Rn+1, taking the conic hull of P there, applying a linear 
transformation of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1Rn+1, and ﬁnally taking the inverse image with respect to 
the embedding of double struck upper R Superscript nRn. So the claim follows from (3) and (5). 
(8) We ﬁrst assume that upper P equals script upper S left parenthesis upper L right parenthesisP = S(L) is a spectrahedron, deﬁned by the monic

is also a compact spectrahedral shadow, and from (3.2) we see that S is

Bipolar Theorem B.5 applied to S, there exists v element of upper S Superscript ringv ∈S◦with v Superscript upper T Baseline u less than negative 1vT u < −1. From  
v element of upper S Superscript ringv ∈S◦we obtain

psd matrix) we get upper L left parenthesis v right parenthesis element of upper S y m Subscript k Superscript plusL(v) ∈Sym+
k , which means v element of upper Pv ∈P and thus u not an element of upper P Superscript ringu /∈P ◦. From  
all of this we conclude that upper P Superscript ring Baseline equals upper SP ◦= S is a spectrahedral shadow.

In the next step assume that P is an arbitrary spectrahedron. Since a 
translation of P leads to a projective transformation of upper P Superscript ringP ◦, we can assume 
that P contains the origin in its relative interior, using (7). Furthermore, upper P Superscript ringP ◦is 
simply a cylinder over the polar of P in its afﬁne hull, so the statement follows 
from what we have just proven, using Lemma 2.12 and (2). 
Finally, in the general case upper P equals pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP = πx(S) for some spectrahedron S, we have  
v element of upper P Superscript ring Baseline left right double arrow left parenthesis v comma 0 right parenthesis element of upper S Superscript ringv ∈P ◦⇔(v, 0) ∈S◦
and the result follows from what we have already proven and (3). 
(9) follows from upper P Superscript or Baseline equals c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis Superscript or Baseline equals c o n e left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis Superscript ringP ∨= cone(P)∨= cone(P)◦, using (5) and (8). 
(10) follows from (8), since we may assume 0 element of upper P0 ∈P and thus c l o s left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis equals left parenthesis upper P Superscript ring Baseline right parenthesis Superscript ringclos(P) = (P ◦)◦by 
the Bipolar Theorem B.5. 
(11) Since pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis r e l i n t left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis equals r e l i n t left parenthesis pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis equals r e l i n t left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisπx(relint(S(M))) = relint(πx(S(M))) = relint(P) (see Exercise 3.7), 
it sufﬁces to prove the statement for spectrahedra. We thus assume that L is 
a linear matrix polynomial with upper P equals script upper S left parenthesis upper L right parenthesisP = S(L). For a ﬁxed point u 0 element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisu0 ∈relint(P)
and u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn, we have  u element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper P right parenthesisu ∈relint(P) if and only if there exists epsilon greater than 0ε > 0 such that 
u plus epsilon left parenthesis u minus u 0 right parenthesis element of upper Pu + ε(u −u0) ∈P, i.e., upper L left parenthesis u plus epsilon left parenthesis u minus u 0 right parenthesis right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0L(u + ε(u −u0)) ⩾0 (see Exercise 3.6). Now we just

To what extent do the results in Theorem 3.5 also hold for spectrahedra? More 
precisely, if upper P comma upper Q comma upper RP, Q, R are spectrahedra, which of the sets constructed in (1)–(10) are 
again spectrahedra? 
Note that the proof of Theorem 3.5 is completely constructive, so given concrete 
representations of upper P comma upper Q comma upper RP, Q, R as spectrahedral shadows, the steps in the proof can be 
turned into concrete representations of the resulting convex sets. 
In Sect. 3.4 below we will need the following reﬁnement of Theorem 3.5 (11) on 
interiors of spectrahedral shadows, from [67]: 
Theorem 3.9 
Let upper S comma upper TS, T be spectrahedral shadows in double struck upper R Superscript nRn with upper T subset of or equal to upper ST ⊆S and S closed. Let script upper F Subscript upper TFT

which is clearly a spectrahedral shadow, and also a subset of upper S overTildeS. We thus already 
know that upper T overTilde left arrow with loop upper S overTildeT ↫S is a spectrahedral shadow, so we ﬁnish the proof by showing

For the ﬁrst inclusion, let left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis element of upper T overTilde left arrow with loop upper S overTilde(u, v) ∈T ↫S be given. Thus there is left parenthesis a comma b right parenthesis element of upper T overTilde(a, b) ∈T and

F of upper S overTildeS containing left parenthesis a comma b right parenthesis(a, b), such that left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper F overTilde right parenthesis period(u, v) ∈relint(

left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis plus epsilon left parenthesis left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis minus left parenthesis a comma b right parenthesis right parenthesis element of upper F overTilde period(u, v) + ε ((u, v) −(a, b)) ∈

It follows that u plus epsilon left parenthesis u minus a right parenthesis element of pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis upper F overTilde right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper S commau + ε(u −a) ∈πx(

Positive Polynomials and the Lasserre-Parrilo Relaxation 
In this section we introduce an important method to systematically and explicitly 
construct spectrahedal shadows, approximating a given semialgebraic set. It is 
described in [57], similar ideas can be found in [76], and we thus call it the Lasserre-
Parrilo relaxation method. In many cases this method can be used to show that the 
convex hull of the initial semialgebraic set is a spectrahedral shadow, as we will 
demonstrate in the following sections. The basic building blocks for Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxations are truncated quadratic modules and their duals. We brieﬂy review the 
deﬁnitions here, and refer to Sect. A in the appendix for more detailed explanations. 
Throughout, let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be a tuple of polynomials from double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. We set  
p 0 equals 1p0 = 1 and denote by

the quadratic module generated by p. Here, upper Sigma denotes the set of sums of squares 
of polynomials in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. Just as ideals contain polynomials that obviously vanish 
on the zero set of its generators, a quadratic module contains polynomials that 
are obviously nonnegative on the basic closed semialgebraic set deﬁned by the 
generators p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr. 
For d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0 we set

prove the other one:

are descending. Our ﬁrst goal now is to characterize exactness in terms of nonneg-
ative polynomials and sums of squares with degree bounds. It will allow us to use 
Positivstellensätze to prove that certain sets are spectrahedral shadows. 
Proposition 3.18 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Superscript rp = (p1, . . . , pr) ∈R[x]r and upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p). For  d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0 consider the 
following statements: 
1. The Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation is exact up to closure in degree d, i.e., 
c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis periodconv(S) ⊆R[d](p) ⊆clos(conv(S)).
2. Every script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketℓ∈R[x] with degree left parenthesis script l right parenthesis equals 1deg(ℓ) = 1 and script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ|S ⩾0 is contained in upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p). 
Then left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) implies left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis(1). The converse also holds if S has non-empty interior. 
Proof (2)right double arrow⇒(1): Suppose that (1) does not hold, and set upper C equals c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesisC = clos(conv(S)). Since 
c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisconv(S) ⊆R[d](p) by Proposition 3.16, there must exist u element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis minus upper Cu ∈R[d](p) \ C. Hence, 
by the Separation Theorem B.4, there is a polynomial 
script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 with script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ|S ⩾0

and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0ℓ(u) < 0. Since u element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisu ∈R[d](p), there exists upper L element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis primeL ∈QM[d](p)′ such that u equals left parenthesis upper L left parenthesis x 1 right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma upper L left parenthesis x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesisu =

. Now since degree left parenthesis script l right parenthesis equals 1deg(ℓ) = 1 and upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis equals 1L(1) = 1, we have  
upper L left parenthesis script l right parenthesis equals script l left parenthesis upper L left parenthesis x 1 right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma upper L left parenthesis x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis equals upper L left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0 commaL(ℓ) = ℓ

which implies script l not an element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis commaℓ/∈QM[d](p), so also (2) fails. 
(1)right double arrow⇒(2): Let script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketℓ∈R[x] with degree left parenthesis script l right parenthesis equals 1deg(ℓ) = 1 and script l Subscript vertical bar Sub Subscript upper S Subscript Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ|S ⩾0. Since S has non-empty 
interior, and polynomials from upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) are nonnegative on S, we must have  
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection left parenthesis minus upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesis equals StartSet 0 EndSet periodQM(p) ∩(−QM(p)) = {0}.
By Proposition A.19 this implies that upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) is closed. So if script lℓis not contained in 
upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p), there exists 
upper L element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Superscript or Baseline with upper L left parenthesis script l right parenthesis less than 0 commaL ∈QM[d](p)∨with L(ℓ) < 0,
by the Biduality Theorem B.5. We claim that there also exists such L with upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis equals 1L(1) = 1. 
If upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis not equals 0L(1) ̸= 0, then upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis greater than 0L(1) > 0 since 1 element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis1 ∈QM[d](p), so we can just rescale. If upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis equals 0L(1) = 0, 
take any upper L 1 element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Superscript orL1 ∈QM[d](p)∨with upper L 1 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis equals 1L1(1) = 1 (for example a point evaluation) and let 
upper L prime equals alpha upper L plus upper L 1L′ = αL + L1. Then upper L primeL′ has the desired property when alphaα is sufﬁciently large.

⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 3.19 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Superscript rp = (p1, . . . , pr) ∈R[x]r be a tuple of polynomials, and upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn a subset. 
We say that p is an Archimedean description of S if upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) and the quadratic 
module upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is Archimedean (see Deﬁnition A.12). 
Note that if p is an Archimedean description of S, then S must be bounded 
(and thus compact). In case that script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) is bounded, but the description by p is 
not Archimedean, one can redress this in principle by adding lamda minus sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts x Subscript i Superscript 2λ −
i x2
i to the 
generators, for some sufﬁciently large real lamda periodλ. Also note that if upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is closed 
under products, i.e., a preordering, then boundedness of upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) already implies 
that p is an Archimedean description of S, by Schmüdgen’s Positivstellensatz 
Theorem A.11. 
A direct consequence of the Positivstellensätze by Schmüdgen Theorem A.11 
and Putinar Theorem A.13 is the following important convergence and approxima-
tion result:

Theorem 3.20 
Let p be an Archimedean description of S. Then the Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxations of S with respect to p converge to c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S). 
Proof We will show 
c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals intersection Underscript d greater than or slanted equals 0 Endscripts script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisconv(S) =

where the inclusion from left to right is clear by Proposition 3.16. Now if  u not an element of c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisu /∈
conv(S), then there exists script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 with script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than 0ℓ|S > 0 and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0ℓ(u) < 0, by the Separation 
Theorem B.4 (note again that S and thus c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) are compact, and thus closed). By 
Putinar’s Positivstellensatz A.13 we have script l element of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisℓ∈QM(p) and hence script l element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisℓ∈QM[d](p) for 
some d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0 (depending on script lℓ). This implies u not an element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisu /∈R[d](p), by the same argument as 
in Proposition 3.18. 
⊓⊔
Example 3.21 
To illustrate the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation method, we discuss an example in detail. 
Consider the polynomials 
p 1 equals x 2 minus x 1 cubed comma p 2 equals x 1 comma p 3 equals 1 minus x 1 comma p 4 equals x 2 comma p 5 equals 1 minus x 2p1 = x2 −x3
1, p2 = x1, p3 = 1 −x1, p4 = x2, p5 = 1 −x2
in the variables x 1 comma x 2x1, x2. Then upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) is already convex, and we claim that 
upper S equals script upper R Subscript left bracket 3 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodS = R[3](p).
In particular, S is a spectrahedral shadow. We use Proposition 3.18 and show that upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 3 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[3](p)
contains all script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 with script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ|S ⩾0. 
Let script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 be such a polynomial. If script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0ℓ(u) > 0 for all u element of upper Su ∈S, then script lℓwill assume its 
minimum epsilonε in some point of S, since S is compact. Since epsilon element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 3 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisε ∈QM[3](p) it sufﬁces to show 
script l minus epsilon element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 3 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisℓ−ε ∈QM[3](p). Also, if script lℓis already nonnegative on the box left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket times left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket[0, 1] × [0, 1], we can use 
Farkas’s Lemma B.23 and conclude that script lℓis contained in 
c o n e left parenthesis x 1 comma 1 minus x 1 comma x 2 comma 1 minus x 2 right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 3 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis period cone(x1, 1 −x1, x2, 1 −x2) ⊆QM[3](p).

Exercise 3.22 
Compute the ﬁrst and second Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation in Example 3.21.
▶Remark 3.23 Sometimes a slightly different version of the Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxation is used, especially in the context of theta bodies (see Remark 3.25 
below). First recall that upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) (and thus also c l o s left parenthesis upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisclos(QM[d](p))) is a spectrahe-
dral shadow, by Proposition 3.14 and Theorem 3.5 (10). So the sets 
double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 Baseline intersection upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis and double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 Baseline intersection c l o s left parenthesis upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisR[x]1 ∩QM[d](p) and R[x]1 ∩clos(QM[d](p))
of linear polynomials from upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) and its closure are also spectrahedral 
shadows. Since, by Proposition A.19, the truncated quadratic module is often 
closed anyway, we will now just work with the closure (but of course everything 
works with upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p), as well). The set

is easily checked to be a spectrahedral shadow again. In fact, it is the inverse 
image of the dual of 
double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 intersection c l o s left parenthesis upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisR[x]1 ∩clos(QM[d](p)), under the canonical afﬁne 
embedding of double struck upper R Superscript nRn into the dual space of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1R[x]1. 
One advantage of this approach is that ModifyingAbove script upper R With tilde Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis
R[d](p) is deﬁned by a family of linear 
inequalities. In particular, it is always closed. On the other hand, our earlier 
deﬁned script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisR[d](p) is, by deﬁnition, an explicit projection of a spectrahedron, 
whereas for ModifyingAbove script upper R With tilde Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis
R[d](p) the semideﬁnite description is much less explicitly given. 
The relation between the two notions is discussed in Exercise 3.24.

Positive Polynomials and the Lasserre-Parrilo Relaxation

▶Remark 3.25 (Theta Bodies) A construction closely related to the Lasserre-
Parrilo relaxation is the theta body construction. A ﬁrst version was used 
by Lovasz already in 1979 [62], a general treatment can be found in [32]. 
Theta bodies are mostly used for semideﬁnite relaxations of hard combinatorial 
optimization problems. It turns out that they are equivalent to Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxations for real varieties, under some mild assumptions. This is what we will 
now explain. 
Let upper I subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketI ⊆R[x] be an ideal and 
upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis equals StartSet u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar p left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0 for all p element of upper I EndSetV = VR(I) = {u ∈Rn | p(u) = 0 ∀p ∈I}
the set of real points of the associated afﬁne variety. For d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0, we deﬁne 
upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis colon equals upper Sigma Subscript 2 d Baseline plus upper I subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketSOS[2d](I) := 2d + I ⊆R[x]
as the set of those polynomials that are sums of squares of degree 2d modulo the 
ideal I. The  d-th theta body of I is then deﬁned as 
upper Theta Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis colon equals StartSet u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 for all script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 Baseline intersection upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis EndSet period[d](I) :=

u ∈Rn | ℓ(u) ⩾0 ∀ℓ∈R[x]1 ∩SOS[2d](I)

.
The 
upper Theta Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis[d](I) thus provide a decreasing outer approximation of the closed 
convex hull of V by closed sets. To compare theta bodies with Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxations, we ﬁrst note that V is also a basic closed semialgebraic set. If 
upper I equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis commaI = (p1, . . . , pr), then clearly 
upper V equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis periodV = S(p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr).
Since every polynomial q is a difference of two sums of squares (even of degree 
at most degree left parenthesis q right parenthesis plus 1deg(q) + 1, see Exercise 3.27), we obtain 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis equals upper Sigma plus upper I commaQM(p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr) =  + I,
where upper Sigma denotes the set of all sums of squares of polynomials. However, there is 
a slight difference between upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisQM[2d](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr) and upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis periodSOS[2d](I). But 
for the right choice of generators p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr we indeed have 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis 2nd Column subset of or equal to upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 2 d Baseline 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 2 d plus 1 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis comma EndLayoutQM[2d](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr) ⊆SOS[2d](I) ∩R[x]2d
⊆QM[2d+1](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr),
where the ﬁrst inclusion is obvious. For the second assume that 
p equals sigma plus qp = σ + q

for some sigma element of upper Sigma Subscript 2 d Baseline comma q element of upper Iσ ∈2d, q ∈I, and degree left parenthesis p right parenthesis less than or slanted equals 2 ddeg(p) ⩽2d. We get q element of upper I intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 2 dq ∈I ∩R[x]2d and can ﬁnd 
a representation 
q equals sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts q Subscript i Baseline p Subscript iq =

i
qipi
with certain degree bounds on the terms 
q Subscript i Baseline p Subscript iqipi, depending only on d and 
p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr. This is due to the fact that upper I intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 2 dI ∩R[x]2d is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector 
space, and thus has a ﬁnite basis. But by choosing the generators of I well, one 
can in fact get explicit control over these degrees. For example, if p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr is 
a Gröbner basis of I with respect to some degree-compatible monomial order, 
we obtain a representation with degree left parenthesis q Subscript i Baseline p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis less than or slanted equals 2 ddeg(qipi) ⩽2d for all i. Now writing each q Subscript iqi
as a difference of two sums of squares as in Exercise 3.27, the representation 
p equals sigma plus qp = σ + q turns into a representation from upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 2 d plus 1 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisQM[2d+1](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr). 
We thus immediately obtain 
ModifyingAbove script upper R With tilde Subscript left bracket 2 d plus 1 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Theta Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis subset of or equal to ModifyingAbove script upper R With tilde Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis
R[2d+1](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr) ⊆[d](I) ⊆
R[2d](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr)
where we use the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation described in Remark 3.23. To be  
precise, the inclusion on the right is only valid if upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma minus p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma minus p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisQM[2d](p1, −p1, . . . , pr, −pr)
or upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 2 dSOS[2d](I) ∩R[x]2d is closed, since we have used the closure in Construction 
(3.3) from Remark 3.23. If  I is a real radical ideal, then upper S upper O upper S Subscript left bracket 2 d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 2 dSOS[2d](I) ∩R[x]2d is 
closed, see for example [82], Proposition 2.6 (b). 
Summarizing, if p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr form a Gröbner basis (with respect to a degree 
compatible monomial order) of the real radical ideal I, then theta bodies and 
Lasserre-Parrilo relaxations are nested in between each other, and can therefore 
be considered equivalent relaxations of the set c o n v left parenthesis script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis right parenthesis periodconv(VR(I)).
Example 3.26 
Consider the full 0/1-hypercube 
upper C colon equals left brace 0 comma 1 right brace Superscript n Baseline subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline periodC := {0, 1}n ⊆Rn.
We have upper C equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisC = VR(I) with upper I equals left parenthesis x 1 minus x 1 squared comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline minus x Subscript n Superscript 2 Baseline right parenthesisI = (x1 −x2
1, . . . , xn −x2
n). From 
x Subscript i Baseline equals x Subscript i Superscript 2 Baseline plus left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline minus x Subscript i Superscript 2 Baseline right parenthesis and left parenthesis 1 minus x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 1 minus x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline minus x Subscript i Superscript 2 Baseline right parenthesisxi = x2
i + (xi −x2
i ) and (1 −xi) = (1 −xi)2 + (xi −x2
i )
we obtain x Subscript i Baseline comma 1 minus x Subscript i Baseline element of upper S upper O upper S 2 left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisxi, 1 −xi ∈SOS2(I) and thus upper Theta 1 left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis equals c o n v left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis equals left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket Superscript n Baseline period1(I) = conv(C) = [0, 1]n.

Convex Hulls of Curves 
In this chapter we discuss Scheiderer’s positive solution of the Helton-Nie con-
jecture in dimension two [98]: Every convex semialgebraic subset of the plane is a 
spectrahedral shadow. This is obtained as a consequence of a stronger result, namely 
the stability of quadratic modules deﬁning 1-dimensional bounded sets. 
We recall the most important notions and results on afﬁne varieties: To an afﬁne 
variety 
upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper C Superscript nV = VC(I) ⊆Cn
deﬁned over double struck upper RR by an ideal upper I subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketI ⊆R[x], there corresponds the coordinate ring 
double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket colon equals double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket divided by script upper I left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR[V ] := R[x]/I(V )
where script upper I left parenthesis upper V right parenthesis equals StartRoot upper I EndRootI(V ) =
√
I is the vanishing ideal. The coordinate ring is a ﬁnitely-
generated and reduced double struck upper RR-algebra. The variety V is often treated as an abstract object 
encoded in double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ], independent of the choice of coordinates, i.e., the choice of the 
surjection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket right arrow double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[x] →R[V ]. For example, V can be recovered as the set of all algebra 
homomorphisms from double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ] to double struck upper CC. Recall also that a morphism 
phi colon upper V right arrow upper Wϕ : V →W
between two afﬁne varieties V and W over double struck upper RR is simply a real polynomial map from 
V to W, with respect to some embedding of V and W into afﬁne space. Such a 
morphism induces a homomorphism 
phi Superscript asterisk Baseline colon double struck upper R left bracket upper W right bracket right arrow double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketϕ∗: R[W] →R[V ]
of double struck upper RR-algebras, given by p right arrow from bar p ring phip →p ◦ϕ, and each algebra homomorphism comes from 
a morphism of varieties. 
If Q is a ﬁnitely generated quadratic module in double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ], we want to make sense of 
the notion of stability for Q (see Sect. A.2 for details on stability). With the notation 
from the last section, stability of a quadratic module means that for every d there 
exists some e such that 
upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis period QMd(p) ⊆QM[e](p).

Spectrahedral Shadows
Informally, stability expresses the fact that in sums-of-squares representation of 
elements we have degree-bounds on the single terms in the representation. The 
problem here is that we have no well-deﬁned notion of degree for elements in 
double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ]. There are two solutions: Fixing coordinates, choosing p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketp1, . . . , pr ∈R[x]
with upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis ModifyingAbove p With quotation dash Subscript 1 Baseline comma ellipsis comma ModifyingAbove p With quotation dash Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis commaQ = QM(p1, . . . , pr), and generators script upper I left parenthesis upper V right parenthesis equals left parenthesis q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisI(V ) = (q1, . . . , qs) of the vanishing 
ideal, we can consider the quadratic module 
upper Q 0 equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline comma plus or minus q 1 comma ellipsis comma plus or minus q Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisQ0 = QM(p1, . . . , pr, ±q1, . . . , ±qs)
in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x], which is just the preimage of Q in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] under the residue map double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket right arrow double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket divided by script upper I left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR[x] →
R[x]/I(V ) (c.f. proof of Corollary A.26). Then we say that Q is stable if and only if 
upper Q 0Q0 is. We would have to show that this does not depend on the choice of coordinates. 
More elegantly, we can just eliminate the notion of degree from the deﬁnition of 
stability: Let A be any commutative double struck upper RR-algebra and upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQ = QM(p) a ﬁnitely generated 
quadratic module in A. Given a linear subspace W of A, we write 
upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals left brace sigma summation Underscript i equals 0 Overscript r Endscripts sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript i Baseline vertical bar sigma Subscript i Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript j Endscripts g Subscript i j Superscript 2 Baseline with g Subscript i j Baseline element of upper W for all i comma j right braceQM[W](p) =
 r

i=0
σipi | σi =

j
g2
ij with gij ∈W for all i, j

and say that Q is stable if for every ﬁnite-dimensional subspace U of A there exists 
a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace W of A, such that 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection upper U subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodQM(p) ∩U ⊆QM[W](p).
Note that the earlier deﬁnition of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) and the new one of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[W](p) are 
slightly different in ﬂavour, since the ﬁrst imposes some degree-restriction on the 
terms sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript iσipi, whereas the latter imposes it on the single g Subscript i jgij. However, if the degree of 
a sum  
sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript i Baseline equals left parenthesis sigma summation Underscript j Endscripts g Subscript i j Superscript 2 Baseline right parenthesis p Subscript iσipi =
⎛
⎝
j
g2

⎠pi
in the polynomial ring is bounded by some number d, we immediately get that the 
degree of each g Subscript i jgij is bounded by one half left parenthesis d minus degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis 1
2(d −deg(pi)) (compare to Exercise 3.13). So the 
two notions of truncations are indeed equivalent. In particular, the new deﬁnition of 
stability agrees with the above one for the polynomial ring, and it is independent of 
the choice of generators. 
Exercise 3.28 
Show that the notion of stability of a quadratic module upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) in a commutative 
double struck upper RR-algebra A, as just deﬁned, does not depend on the choice of generators p.

Now let V be an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety. We write upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) for the set of real points of V . 
If upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisV = VC(I) is an explicit embedding of V , then clearly upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisV (R) = VR(I) is the set 
of real zeros of the elements from I (otherwise upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) can for example be deﬁned as 
the set of real-valued algebra homomorphisms on double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ]). Given a subset S of upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R), 
the preordering 
script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis colon equals StartSet q element of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket vertical bar q Subscript vertical bar Sub Subscript upper S Subscript Baseline greater than or equals 0 EndSetP(S) := {q ∈R[V ] | q|S ≥0}
is called the saturated preordering of S. A ﬁnitely generated quadratic module upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQ =
QM(p), with p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) and all p Subscript i Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketpi ∈R[V ], is called saturated if upper Q equals script upper P left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisQ =
P(S(p)), where 
script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis colon equals left brace u element of upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis vertical bar p 1 left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right braceS(p) := {u ∈V (R) | p1(u) ⩾0, . . . , pr(u) ⩾0}
is the basic closed semialgebraic set deﬁned by p within upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R). As explained in 
Sect. A.2, the saturated preordering script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) of a semialgebraic set S is never ﬁnitely 
generated if dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 3dim(S) ⩾3 (i.e., never of the form upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) for some ﬁnite tuple p 
of generators). On the other hand, it is ﬁnitely generated for any subset of the line 
(see Example A.9). It turns out that this is also true for compact subsets of smooth 
algebraic curves. Recall that a variety is called smooth if it does not possess any 
singular points, neither real nor complex. For an afﬁne hypersurface script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisVC(q), with q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈
R[x] irreducible, this just means nabla q left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇q(u) ̸= 0 for all u element of script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisu ∈VC(q). The afﬁne variety 
V is called an afﬁne curve if all of its irreducible components are one-dimensional 
(which means that every prime ideal in the coordinate ring is either minimal or 
maximal). 
The following result by Scheiderer [94] is the ﬁrst main ingredient for the result 
on planar spectrahedral shadows. 
Theorem 3.29 
Let Z be a smooth afﬁne curve over 
double struck upper R commaR, and 
upper S subset of or equal to upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisS
⊆
Z(R) a compact 
semialgebraic subset. Then the saturated preordering script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketP(S) ⊆R[Z] is ﬁnitely 
generated (as a quadratic module). 
Since the saturated preordering script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) is ﬁnitely generated, it makes sense to ask 
whether it is stable. To show that it is, we will consider its behavior under real 
closed extensions of double struck upper RR, see Sect. A.4 for a detailed explanation of this connection, 
and for example [83] for more information on general real closed ﬁelds and some 
model theory. Let normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R be a real closed ﬁeld extension and let normal upper C equals normal upper R left bracket StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot right bracketC = R[

algebraic closure. If 
upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper C Superscript nV = VC(q1, . . . , qs) ⊆Cn

then we can regard

as an afﬁne variety deﬁned over normal upper RR with coordinate ring normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket equals normal upper R left bracket x right bracket divided by StartRoot left parenthesis q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis EndRootR[V ] = R[x]/√(q1, . . . , qs). 
One can show that there is a canonical isomorphism 
normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket approximately equals double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline normal upper R commaR[V ] ∼= R[V ] ⊗R R,
which yields a more intrinsic description of normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ]. The main technical result of 
Scheiderer in [98] is the following. 
Theorem 3.30 
Let Z be a smooth afﬁne curve over double struck upper RR, let  upper S subset of or equal to upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisS ⊆Z(R) be a compact 
semialgebraic subset and let upper P equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketP = P(S) ⊆R[Z] be the saturated preordering 
of S. Then for any real closed ﬁeld extension normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R, the preordering upper P Subscript normal upper RPR
generated by P in normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z] is again saturated. 
Note that if P is generated by the tuple p as a quadratic module in double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z], then upper P Subscript upper RPR
is generated by p as a quadratic module in normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z]. Also note that the semialgebraic 
subset script upper S left parenthesis upper P Subscript normal upper R Baseline right parenthesisS(PR) of upper Z left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisZ(R) is the base extension upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisS(R) of S (i.e., the set deﬁned by the 
same equations as S, for example by p), hence the theorem says exactly that 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket periodQM(p) = P(S(R)) ⊆R[Z].
We will discuss this result and its proof in Sect. A.5 of the appendix. For now, we 
will just apply it to show stability of script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S). 
Corollary 3.31 
For Z and S as above, the saturated preordering script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) in double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z] is ﬁnitely 
generated (as a quadratic module) and stable. 
Proof We only need to show stability of P. This comes as an application of 
Proposition A.39, which also holds for stability of quadratic modules in general 
double struck upper RR-algebras, with the same proof. That upper P Subscript normal upper RPR is saturated implies that the intersection 
of upper P Subscript normal upper RPR with any ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket equals double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline normal upper RR[Z] = R[Z] ⊗R R is semialgebraic

over normal upper RR (the proof is completely analogues to that of Proposition A.17). This holds 
for any real closed normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R, so  P is stable by Proposition A.39. 
⊓⊔
We now apply this result in the context of the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation. Simply 
speaking, we would like to show that the convex hull of a compact 1-dimensional 
set in double struck upper R Superscript nRn possesses an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation. This is easy to deduce from 
Corollary 3.31, but only for subsets of smooth curves. To avoid this assumption, we 
need a few more preparations. Since stability means that we have degree bounds 
for all non-negative polynomials, not only linear ones, we have more ﬂexibility and 
coordinate-independence, which can be exploited as follows. 
Proposition 3.32 
Let V be an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety, and upper S subset of or equal to upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisS ⊆V (R) be a semialgebraic set whose 
saturated preordering script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) in double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ] is ﬁnitely generated and stable. Then for 
any morphism of varieties 
phi colon upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nϕ : V (R) →Rn
the set c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis phi left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesisclos (conv(ϕ(S))) is a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof Let phi Superscript asterisk Baseline colon double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket right arrow double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketϕ∗: R[x] →R[V ] be the homomorphism of double struck upper RR-algebras induced by phiϕ, 
and ﬁx generators p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketp1, . . . , pr ∈R[V ] of the saturated preordering of S: 
script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodP(S) = QM(p).
Since script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) is stable, there exists a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace W of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ] such that 
phi Superscript asterisk Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis intersection script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodϕ∗(R[x]1) ∩P(S) ⊆QM[W](p).
Choose another ﬁnite-dimensional subspace U of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket commaR[V ], which contains both 
upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[W](p) and the space phi Superscript asterisk Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1 Baseline right parenthesisϕ∗(R[x]1). Now just as in Proposition 3.14, the convex 
set 
upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis prime colon equals left brace upper L element of upper U Superscript asterisk Baseline StartAbsoluteValue upper L EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper Q upper M Sub Subscript left bracket upper W right bracket Subscript left parenthesis p right parenthesis Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0 and upper L left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis equals 1 right braceQM[W](p)′ := {L ∈U∗| L|QM[W](p) ⩾0 and L(1) = 1}

▶Remark 3.33 In spite of its apparent generality, the hypotheses of this propo-
sition can only be satisﬁed if V has dimension at most 1, by the main result of 
[95]. 
Now if Z is any afﬁne curve over double struck upper RR, possibly singular, we can get rid of the 
singularities by passing to the normalisation of Z. If  Z is irreducible, this is the 
curve corresponding to the integral closure of the domain double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z] in its quotient ﬁeld 
double struck upper R left parenthesis upper Z right parenthesisR(Z). This integral closure is again a ﬁnitely generated double struck upper RR-algebra, and therefore 
corresponds to an afﬁne curve upper Z overTildeZ over double struck upper RR. The inclusion double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper Z overTilde right bracketR[Z] ⊆R[Z] corresponds 
to a morphism upper Z overTilde right arrow upper ZZ →Z of curves, which is an isomorphism everywhere except over 
the singular points of Z. Since double struck upper R left bracket upper Z overTilde right bracketR[Z] is integrally closed, the curve upper Z overTildeZ is smooth.1 The 
map upper Z overTilde right arrow upper ZZ →Z is surjective, but its restriction ModifyingAbove upper Z With tilde left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis right arrow upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisZ(R) →Z(R) to real points may be 
non-surjective. In fact, a point u element of upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisu ∈Z(R) is outside the image of ModifyingAbove upper Z With tilde left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisZ(R) if and only if 
it is an isolated singularity of Z, in which case it is the image of (potentially several) 
pairs of complex-conjugate points in upper Z overTildeZ. The  map ModifyingAbove upper Z With tilde left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis right arrow upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisZ(R) →Z(R) is however proper 
in the euclidean topology, i.e., it is closed with compact ﬁbres. 
If Z has several irreducible components, say upper Z equals upper Z 1 union midline horizontal ellipsis union upper Z Subscript kZ = Z1 ∪· · · ∪Zk, we can apply 
the normalisation separately to each component and obtain the normalisation upper Z overTilde equals upper Z overTilde Subscript 1 Baseline square cup midline horizontal ellipsis square cup upper Z overTilde Subscript kZ =

With all of this we are ready for the ﬁrst main result on curves and spectrahedral 
shadows (see Fig. 3.4 for an example).
1 In general, the singular locus of an irreducible afﬁne variety V with integrally closed coordinate 
ring has codimension at least 2 in V . Thus if V is a curve, it must be smooth.

Theorem 3.34 
Every compact convex semialgebraic set whose set of extreme points has 
dimension at most 1 is a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof Denote the compact convex set by C. Let  S be the closure of the set of 
extreme points of C, a compact semialgebraic set of dimension at most 1 by 
hypothesis. Let Z be the Zariski-closure of S, an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety of dimension 
at most 1. Let upper Z 1 comma ellipsis comma upper Z Subscript k BaselineZ1, . . . , Zk be the irreducible components of Z, let  upper Z overTilde Subscript i Baseline right arrow upper Z Subscript iZi →Zi be

The variety Y comes with a natural morphism phi colon upper Y right arrow upper Zϕ : Y →Z which is the normalisation

Spectrahedral Shadows
Corollary 3.35 
Every compact convex semialgebraic subset of double struck upper R squaredR2 is a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof For a convex semialgebraic set in the plane, the extreme points form a 
semialgebraic set of dimension at most 1, so Theorem 3.34 applies. 
⊓⊔
Finally, we show how to deduce the full two-dimensional Helton-Nie conjecture 
from the above result. This amounts to dealing ﬁrst with closed but not necessarily 
bounded semialgebraic subsets of the plane, and then performing some surgery on 
the boundary in the general case. 
Theorem 3.36 
Every convex semialgebraic subset of double struck upper R squaredR2 is a spectrahedral shadow.

, and by using Theorem 3.5 (3), it is 
enough to show that C is a spectrahedral shadow. Let U be the lineality space of C 
(c.f. Exercise B.3). Then 
upper C equals left parenthesis upper C intersection upper U Superscript perpendicular Baseline right parenthesis plus upper UC = (C ∩U⊥) + U
and upper C intersection upper U Superscript perpendicularC ∩U⊥is pointed, so using Theorem 3.5 (4) we may assume that C is pointed. 
In that case, by Proposition B.1, there exists an afﬁne hyperplane upper H subset of or equal to double struck upper R cubed commaH ⊆R3, such that 
upper C equals c o n e left parenthesis upper C intersection upper H right parenthesisC = cone(C ∩H) and upper C intersection upper HC ∩H is compact. Now upper C intersection upper HC ∩H is a spectrahedral shadow 
by Corollary 3.35, hence so is C by Theorem 3.5 (5). 
For the general case, we may assume as usual that i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis not equals normal empty setint(S) ̸= ∅. We know that 
c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S) is a spectrahedral shadow and upper B equals c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis minus upper SB = clos(S) \ S is a certain one-dimensional 
semialgebraic subset of the boundary of c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S). Let  script upper FF be the ﬁnite set of one-
dimensional faces of c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S). We decompose B as follows: 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column upper B 0 2nd Column equals the relative interior of upper B intersection upper E x left parenthesis c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis inside partial differential left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis 2nd Row 1st Column upper B Subscript upper F 2nd Column equals upper F intersection upper B for upper F element of script upper F EndLayoutB0 = the relative interior of B ∩Ex(clos(S)) inside ∂(S)

It therefore sufﬁces to show that each of the ﬁnitely many sets appearing in this

argument, or using Theorem 3.5 (6)). For upper S Subscript u Sub Subscript iSui, see Exercise 3.11. To deal with upper S 0S0, let

Since T is closed, convex and semialgebraic, we already know that T is a

We claim that upper T left arrow with loop c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals upper S 0T ↫clos(S) = S0, showing that upper S 0S0 is a spectrahedral shadow, by 
Theorem 3.9. To see this let u element of upper S 0u ∈S0. If  u is an interior point of c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S), then clearly 
u element of upper T left arrow with loop c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisu ∈T ↫clos(S) (unless upper T equals normal empty setT = ∅, which is a trivial case, since it implies that S is the 
interior of c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S)). If u 0 element of partial differential upper Su0 ∈∂S, then it is not in upper B 0B0, hence it lies in T and therefore 
in upper T left arrow with loop c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisT ↫clos(S). Conversely, given u in c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S) but not in upper S 0S0, then it is a point of upper B 0B0. 
By the deﬁnition of upper B 0B0, this implies that StartSet u EndSet{u} is the unique face of c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisclos(S) containing 
u in its relative interior. Since u not an element of upper Tu /∈T , this means u not an element of upper T left arrow with loop c l o s left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisu /∈T ↫clos(S). This completes 
the proof.

Spectrahedral Shadows
Nie, which we present in this section, state sufﬁcient conditions for semialgebraic 
sets to be spectrahedral shadows. These conditions can be applied to sets of arbitrary 
dimension, and they even imply the exactness of a Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation. The 
results are all from [41] and [42]. We begin with the easiest case. 
Theorem 3.38 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) be a bounded convex set with non-empty interior. Suppose that
the following condition is satisﬁed:
[SOS-Concavity]
The Hessian matrices minus nabla squared p Subscript i element of upper S y m Subscript n Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket−∇2pi ∈Symn R[x]
are sums of squares for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r. 
Then S possesses an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with respect to p, 
in fact 
upper S equals script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = R[d](p)
where d equals max left brace degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis vertical bar i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma r right braced = max{deg(pi) | i = 1, . . . , r}. In particular, S is a spectrahedral 
shadow. 
For the proof we need the following important lemma: 
Lemma 3.39 
Let upper F element of upper S y m Subscript k Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF ∈Symk R[x] be a matrix polynomial which is a sum of squares, and ﬁx 
u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn. Then the matrix polynomial

Proof By Exercise A.29, a matrix polynomial upper G element of upper S y m Subscript k Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketG ∈Symk R[x] is a sum of squares 
if and only if the polynomial

⊓⊔
A polynomial p whose Hessian is a sum of squares is called sos-convex. By  
Exercise B.24, any such polynomial is convex. But as usual, the converse does not 
hold in general. 
Exercise 3.40 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn] be a homogeneous polynomial. 
(a) Show that if h is convex, then h is nonnegative on double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1Rn+1. 
(b) Show that if h is sos-convex, then h is a sum of squares.

For an example of a convex sum of squares that is not sos-convex, see [1]. There also 
exist convex homogeneous polynomials that are not sums of squares, even though 
not a single explicit example of such a polynomial is known (see [8]). 
Example 3.41 
We consider the n-dimensional TV-screen upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline commaS = S(p) ⊆Rn, deﬁned by the polynomial

so p is obviously sos-concave. Thus Theorem 3.38 implies that the Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxation of S with respect to p becomes exact in degree 4. 
Exercise 3.42 
Work out the construction in the proof of Theorem 3.38 for the TV-screen. In which 
degree does the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation really become exact? 
Next, we present a more sophisticated version of Theorem 3.38, in which the 
deﬁning polynomials are not required to be sos-concave. Instead, we will assume 
that the concavity is strict, at least along the extreme part of the boundary, with a 
uniform lower bound on the curvature. The proof makes use of Putinar’s Theorem 
for matrix polynomials, as proven in the appendix. 
Theorem 3.43 
Let p be an Archimedean description of the convex set S with non-empty 
interior. Suppose that for each .i = 1, . . . , r  the following condition is 
satisﬁed: 
[Strict Concavity]
The function p Subscript ipi is concave on upper S commaS, and if u element of upper Su ∈S
is in the closure of the set of extreme points of 
S at with p Subscript ipi vanishes, then nabla squared p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis∇2pi(u) is 
negative deﬁnite. 
Then S possesses an exact Lasserre relaxation with respect to p. In  
particular, S is a spectrahedral shadow.

it follows that

⊓⊔
Since not every strictly concave polynomial is sos-concave, it is clear that 
Theorem 3.43 can be applied to examples in which Theorem 3.38 fails. In fact, 
one can even show that most concave polynomials (in a suitable sense) are not sos-
concave (see [8]). But explicit examples of such polynomials (as in [1]) are not easy 
to come by. 
On the other hand, the assumption that the deﬁning polynomials p Subscript ipi be strictly 
concave on script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) is still quite restrictive. We can further weaken the hypotheses if 
we make use of our freedom in choosing the deﬁning polynomials p of the basic 
closed set script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p). This needs some technical preliminaries. 
Deﬁnition 3.44 
A twice continuously differentiable function f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R is called strictly quasi-
concave at a point u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline commau ∈Rn, if the Hessian nabla squared f left parenthesis u right parenthesis∇2f (u) is negative deﬁnite on the 
algebraic tangent space StartSet v element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline v equals 0 EndSet{v ∈Rn | ∇f (u)T v = 0}, i.e., if 
For all v element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline minus StartSet 0 EndSet colon nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline v equals 0 long right double arrow v Superscript upper T Baseline left parenthesis nabla squared f left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis v less than 0 periodFor all v ∈Rn \ {0}:

v < 0.
The deﬁnition is simple enough, but not very intuitive. The more natural (but 
weaker condition) deﬁnition of non-strict quasi-concavity is treated in the following 
exercise. 
Exercise 3.45 
Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be convex. A function f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R is called quasi-concave on S if all 
its superlevel sets

for a element of double struck upper Ra ∈R, are convex. Show that a strictly quasi-concave function on S, as deﬁned 
above, is quasi-concave on S.

Example 3.46 
The polynomial p equals x 1 x 2p = x1x2 is strictly quasi-concave on the open quadrant left parenthesis 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis times left parenthesis 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis(0, ∞) × (0, ∞). 
Indeed, we compute nabla p equals left parenthesis x 2 comma x 1 right parenthesis Superscript upper T∇p = (x2, x1)T and

Then given 0 not equals left parenthesis u 1 comma u 2 right parenthesis element of double struck upper R squared0 ̸= (u1, u2) ∈R2, we have  nabla p left parenthesis u 1 comma u 2 right parenthesis Superscript perpendicular Baseline equals s p a n left parenthesis minus u 1 comma u 2 right parenthesis comma∇p(u1, u2)⊥= span(−u1, u2), and the restriction 
of nabla squared p∇2p to that line is minus 2 u 1 u 2−2u1u2, which is negative for u 1 comma u 2 greater than 0u1, u2 > 0. On the other hand, nabla squared p∇2p is 
constant and indeﬁnite, so that p is not concave anywhere. 
Lemma 3.47 
A twice continuously differentiable function f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R is strictly quasi-
concave at a point u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline commau ∈Rn, if and only if there exists mu greater than or slanted equals 0μ ⩾0 such that 
nabla squared f left parenthesis u right parenthesis minus mu dot nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline less than 0 period∇2f (u) −μ · ∇f (u)∇f (u)T < 0.
Proof Put v 0 equals nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma upper A equals nabla squared f left parenthesis u right parenthesis commav0 = ∇f (u), A = ∇2f (u), and suppose there exists muμ as above. Then 
given v element of double struck upper R Superscript nv ∈Rn with v 0 Superscript upper T Baseline v equals 0vT
0 v = 0, we have  
v Superscript upper T Baseline upper A v equals v Superscript upper T Baseline upper A v minus mu v Superscript upper T Baseline v 0 v 0 Superscript upper T Baseline v less than 0 periodvT Av = vT Av −μvT v0vT
0 v < 0.
Conversely, suppose that f is strictly quasi-concave at u. If v 0 equals 0v0 = 0, quasi-concavity 
implies upper A less than 0A < 0 and there is nothing to show, so assume v 0 not equals 0v0 ̸= 0. Since A is negative 
deﬁnite and hence non-degenerate as a bilinear form on the subspace 
upper V colon equals s p a n left parenthesis v 0 right parenthesis Superscript perpendicular Baseline commaV := span(v0)⊥,
it admits an orthogonal complement, i.e., there exists w element of double struck upper R Superscript nw ∈Rn such that 
double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline equals upper V circled plus s p a n left parenthesis w right parenthesis and v Superscript upper T Baseline upper A w equals w Superscript upper T Baseline upper A v equals 0 for all v element of upper V periodRn = V ⊕span(w) and vT Aw = wT Av = 0 for all v ∈V.
Then for any vector v plus lamda w element of double struck upper R Superscript nv + λw ∈Rn, with 0 not equals v element of upper V0 ̸= v ∈V and lamda element of double struck upper Rλ ∈R, and for any mu element of double struck upper Rμ ∈R, 
we compute 
left parenthesis v plus lamda w right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline left parenthesis upper A minus mu v 0 v 0 Superscript upper T Baseline right parenthesis left parenthesis v plus lamda w right parenthesis equals ModifyingBelow v Superscript upper T Baseline upper A v With bottom brace Underscript less than 0 Endscripts plus lamda squared left parenthesis w Superscript upper T Baseline upper A w minus mu left parenthesis w Superscript upper T Baseline v 0 right parenthesis squared right parenthesis period(v + λw)T (A −μv0vT

So we choose mu greater than or slanted equals 0μ ⩾0 such that mu left parenthesis w Superscript upper T Baseline v 0 right parenthesis squared greater than w Superscript upper T Baseline upper A wμ(wT v0)2 > wT Aw (note that w Superscript upper T Baseline v 0 not equals 0wT v0 ̸= 0, since 
w not an element of upper Vw /∈V ).

The next result explains how strictly quasi-concave deﬁning polynomials can 
be changed to strictly concave polynomials (to which then Theorem 3.43 can be 
applied). 
Proposition 3.50 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be an Archimedean description of S, and assume 
that the polynomials p Subscript ipi are strictly quasi-concave on S. Then there exist 
q 0 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baseline element of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis commaq0, . . . , qr ∈QM(p), which are strictly concave on S (see Theorem 3.43), 
and which also provide an Archimedean description of S. 
Proof Choose rho greater than 1ρ

p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis upper B Subscript rho Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to left bracket negative 1 comma 1 right bracketpi(Bρ(0)) ⊆[−1, 1] for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r. Now  for  mu greater than or slanted equals 0μ ⩾0 let g element of double struck upper R left bracket t right bracketg ∈R[t] be as in 
Lemma 3.48, and put 
q 0 colon equals rho squared minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts x Subscript i Superscript 2 Baseline and q Subscript i Baseline colon equals p Subscript i Baseline dot g left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma r periodq0 := ρ2 −

Then upper S subset of or equal to script upper S left parenthesis q right parenthesisS ⊆S(q) is clear. Conversely, let u element of double struck upper R Superscript n minus upper Su ∈Rn \ S. If  u not an element of upper B Subscript rho Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesisu /∈Bρ(0), then q 0 left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0q0(u) < 0, 
hence u not an element of script upper S left parenthesis q right parenthesisu /∈S(q). If u element of upper B Subscript rho Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis minus upper Su ∈Bρ(0) \ S, then negative 1 less than or slanted equals p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0−1 ⩽pi(u) < 0 for some i commai, and hence 
left parenthesis g left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals g left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis greater than 0 comma(g(pi))(u) = g(pi(u)) > 0,

which implies q Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0qi(u) < 0. Thus we have shown upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis q right parenthesisS = S(q), and by the way q 0q0
is deﬁned, q is again an Archimedean description of S. Also, since g is a sum 
of squares, so is g left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisg(pi), which implies q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baseline element of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisq1, . . . , qr ∈QM(p). Since upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is

Now we need to make sure that q 0 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baselineq0, . . . , qr are strictly concave on S. The  
polynomial q 0q0 is everywhere strictly concave, since nabla squared q 0 equals minus 2 upper I Subscript n∇2q0 = −2In. For the others

compact). 
⊓⊔
We now sum up the results of this chapter, combining the various conditions into 
a single statement. 
Corollary 3.51 
Let p be an Archimedean description of a convex set S with non-empty 
interior, and suppose that for each i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r one of the following two

i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma si = 1, . . . , s is either sos-concave or strictly concave on S. Now the arguments in 
the proofs of Theorems 3.38 and 3.43 can be combined by a simple case distinction 
between the sos-concave and strictly concave deﬁning polynomials to show that S 
has an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with respect to q. Since each upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisQM[d](q) is 
contained in some upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[e](p), also some relaxation with respect to p is exact. 
⊓⊔
Example 3.52 
For some lamda greater than nλ > n let 
p 1 equals x 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript n Baseline equals x Subscript n Baseline comma p Subscript n plus 1 Baseline equals lamda minus x 1 minus midline horizontal ellipsis minus x Subscript n Baselinep1 = x1, . . . , pn = xn, pn+1 = λ −x1 −· · · −xn
and p Subscript n plus 2 Baseline equals x 1 midline horizontal ellipsis x Subscript n Baseline minus 1 periodpn+2 = x1 · · · xn −1. It is not hard to check that script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) is bounded and convex, and that 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is Archimedean. 
One can show that p Subscript n plus 2pn+2 is strictly quasi-concave on left parenthesis 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis Superscript n(0, ∞)n (Exercise 3.53), and thus on 
script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p). Since p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript n plus 1 Baselinep1, . . . , pn+1 are linear, they are clearly sos-concave. So script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) possesses an 
exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with respect to p. 
Exercise 3.53 
Show that the polynomial 
p equals x 1 midline horizontal ellipsis x Subscript n Baseline minus 1p = x1 · · · xn −1

Example 3.54 
The statement in Corollary 3.51 is still not the best possible. Consider the polynomials 
p 1 equals x 2 minus x 1 cubed comma p 2 equals x 1 comma p 3 equals 1 minus x 1 comma p 4 equals x 2 comma p 5 equals 1 minus x 2p1 = x2 −x3

and is therefore not strictly quasi-concave at the origin. Therefore, the exactness of the 
Lasserre relaxation does not follow from Corollary 3.51.

Hyperbolicity Cones as Spectrahedral Shadows 
Following [70], we can use the exactness results of Helton and Nie to study 
representations of hyperbolicity cones as spectrahedral shadows. For a hyperbolic 
polynomial h with smooth hyperbolicity cone, this boils down to verifying quasi-
concavity of h on the boundary. But this requires some care, since the concavity 
cannot be strict along lines through the origin, since h is homogeneous. Thus we 
have to take a suitable dehomogenization. First, we will need the following basic 
lemma (for a proof avoiding the use of the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem see [81], 
Lemma 2.4). 
Lemma 3.55 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn] be hyperbolic with respect to e. If  u element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1u ∈Rn+1 is a point 
with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0h(u) = 0 and nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0, then partial differential Subscript e Baseline h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∂eh(u) ̸= 0. 
Proof If nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0, then 
partial differential Subscript v Baseline h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential s EndFraction h left parenthesis u plus s v right parenthesis vertical bar Subscript s equals 0 Baseline not equals 0∂vh(u) = ∂

for generic v element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1v ∈Rn+1. Fix such v element of i n t left parenthesis ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis right parenthesisv ∈int(Ce(h)) and consider the hyperbolic 
polynomial 
h left parenthesis r u plus s v plus t e right parenthesish(ru + sv + te)
in three variables r comma s comma tr, s, t. By Corollary 2.64, this polynomial has a deﬁnite Hermitian 
determinantal representation

where B and C are positive deﬁnite, hence factor as upper B equals upper U upper U Superscript asteriskB = UU∗and upper C equals upper V upper V Superscript asteriskC = V V ∗with 
invertible matrices upper U comma upper VU, V . Now s equals 0s = 0 is a simple root of 
h left parenthesis u plus s v right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis upper A plus s upper B right parenthesis commah(u + sv) = det(A + sB),
which means that upper U Superscript negative 1 Baseline upper A left parenthesis upper U Superscript asterisk Baseline right parenthesis Superscript negative 1U−1A(U∗)−1 has one-dimensional kernel. But then so does A and 
thus also upper V Superscript negative 1 Baseline upper A left parenthesis upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline right parenthesis Superscript negative 1V −1A(V ∗)−1, hence t equals 0t = 0 is also a simple root of det left parenthesis upper A plus t upper C right parenthesis equals h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesisdet(A+tC) = h(u+te). 
This implies partial differential Subscript e Baseline h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∂eh(u) ̸= 0. 
⊓⊔
The following lemma contains the crucial statement of strict quasi-concavity of 
smooth hyperbolic polynomials. A proof avoiding the Helton-Vinnikov Theorem 
can for example be found in [89], Theorem 10. 
Lemma 3.56 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn] be hyperbolic with respect to e with h left parenthesis e right parenthesis greater than 0 commah(e) > 0, and 
suppose that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) is pointed (i.e., does not contain a full line). Let H be any 
afﬁne hyperplane with e element of upper He ∈H, 0 not an element of upper H0 /∈H. Then h vertical bar Subscript upper H Baselineh|H is strictly quasi-concave at 
any point u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper Hu ∈Ce(h) ∩H with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0h(u) ̸= 0 or with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0h(u) = 0 and nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0. 
Proof Let upper H prime colon equals upper H minus eH ′ := H −e, a linear hyperplane in double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1Rn+1. Note that showing strict 
quasi-concavity of h vertical bar Subscript upper H Baselineh|H at u amounts to the following: If v element of upper H prime minus StartSet 0 EndSetv ∈H ′ \ {0} is such that 
partial differential Subscript v Baseline h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0∂vh(u) = 0, then partial differential Subscript v Superscript 2 Baseline h left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than 0∂2
vh(u) < 0 (see Exercise 3.57 below). 
(1) Let u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper Hu ∈Ce(h) ∩H with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0h(u) ̸= 0. Then h left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0h(u) > 0, so we may rescale and 
assume h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 1h(u) = 1. By Corollary 2.67, h is hyperbolic with respect to u. Thus 
for any v element of upper H prime minus StartSet 0 EndSetv ∈H ′ \ {0}, the univariate polynomial h left parenthesis v plus t u right parenthesish(v + tu) has only real roots. 
Since h is homogeneous, the same is true for h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis equals t Superscript d Baseline h left parenthesis t Superscript negative 1 Baseline u plus v right parenthesish(u+tv) = tdh(t−1u+v), where 
d equals degree left parenthesis h right parenthesisd = deg(h). Since h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0h(u) ̸= 0, all these roots are different from 0, hence we may 
write 
h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 1 plus lamda 1 t right parenthesis midline horizontal ellipsis left parenthesis 1 plus lamda Subscript k Baseline t right parenthesish(u + tv) = (1 + λ1t) · · · (1 + λkt)
where k equals degree Subscript t Baseline left parenthesis h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis right parenthesis less than or slanted equals dk = degt(h(u + tv)) ⩽d and minus left parenthesis 1 divided by lamda 1 right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma minus left parenthesis 1 divided by lamda Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis−(1/λ1), . . . , −(1/λk) are the roots of 
h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesish(u + tv). Since ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) is pointed, h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesish(u + tv) cannot be constant for any v element of upper H prime minus StartSet 0 EndSetv ∈
H ′ \ {0}, and we must have k greater than 0k > 0. In particular, the coefﬁcient of t in h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesish(u + tv)
is 
a 1 equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript k Endscripts lamda Subscript ia1 =

and the coefﬁcient of t squaredt2 is

So if a 1 equals 0a1 = 0, then a 2 less than 0a2 < 0, showing that h vertical bar Subscript upper H Baselineh|H is strictly quasi-concave at u. 
(2) Let u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisu ∈Ce(h) with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0h(u) = 0 and nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0. For any v element of upper H prime minus StartSet 0 EndSetv ∈H ′ \ {0}, the  
polynomial 
h left parenthesis r e plus s left parenthesis u minus e right parenthesis plus t v right parenthesis element of double struck upper R left bracket r comma s comma t right bracketh (re + s(u −e) + tv) ∈R[r, s, t]
is the restriction of h to the subspace spanned by e comma u comma ve, u, v, a hyperbolic polyno-
mial of degree d equals degree left parenthesis h right parenthesisd = deg(h) in three variables r comma s comma tr, s, t. Applying Corollary 2.64 
and assuming h left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals 1h(e) = 1, we can ﬁnd Hermitian matrices upper A comma upper BA, B of size d times dd ×d such 
that 
h left parenthesis r e plus s left parenthesis u minus e right parenthesis plus t v right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis r upper I Subscript d Baseline plus s upper A plus t upper B right parenthesis periodh (re + s(u −e) + tv) = det (rId + sA + tB) .
Evaluating at r equals s equals 1r = s = 1, t equals 0t = 0 gives h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis upper I Subscript d Baseline plus upper A right parenthesish(u) = det(Id +A), and since nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0, 
we must have r k left parenthesis upper I Subscript d Baseline plus upper A right parenthesis equals d minus 1rk(Id +A) = d−1 by Lemma 3.55. After a change of coordinates, 
we may assume upper I Subscript d Baseline plus upper A equals upper D i a g left parenthesis 1 comma ellipsis comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesisId +A = Diag(1, . . . , 1, 0). Write upper B equals left parenthesis b Subscript j k Baseline right parenthesis Subscript j comma k less than or slanted equals dB = (bjk)j,k⩽d and expand 
h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis equals a 1 t plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus a Subscript k Baseline t Superscript k Baseline periodh(u + tv) = a1t + · · · + aktk.
Comparing coefﬁcients on both sides of h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis upper I Subscript d Baseline plus upper A plus t upper B right parenthesish(u + tv) = det(Id + A + tB), we ﬁnd 
a 1 equals b Subscript d d Baseline and a 2 equals sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript d minus 1 Endscripts b Subscript j j Baseline b Subscript d d Baseline minus b Subscript j d Baseline ModifyingAbove b With quotation dash Subscript j d Baseline perioda1 = bdd
and
a2 =

So if a 1 equals 0a1 = 0, we cannot have a 2 greater than or slanted equals 0a2 ⩾0 unless b Subscript j d Baseline equals 0bjd = 0 for j equals 1 comma ellipsis comma d minus 1j = 1, . . . , d −1. 
But that would imply h left parenthesis u plus t v right parenthesis equals 0h(u + tv) = 0 for all t, which is impossible under the 
assumption that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) is pointed.

Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x 0 comma ellipsis comma x Subscript n Baseline right bracketh ∈R[x0, . . . , xn] be hyperbolic with respect to e element of double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1e ∈Rn+1. We say that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h)
has smooth boundary if nabla h left parenthesis u right parenthesis not equals 0∇h(u) ̸= 0 for all u not equals 0u ̸= 0 in the boundary of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis periodCe(h).

This notion of smoothness reﬂects the usual one from algebraic geometry, but 
indeed coincides with other possible notions from convexity theory or differential 
geometry (at least if h is square-free), as for example explained in [89]. The 
following is the main result of [70]. 
Theorem 3.59 
Every hyperbolicity cone with smooth boundary is a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketh ∈R[x] be hyperbolic with respect to e with h left parenthesis e right parenthesis greater than 0h(e) > 0, and assume 
that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) has smooth boundary. Let upper V subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1V ⊆Rn+1 be the lineality space of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) (see 
Exercise B.3). Then 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis equals left parenthesis ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper V Superscript perpendicular Baseline right parenthesis plus upper VCe(h) =
0
Ce(h) ∩V ⊥1
+ V
by Exercise B.3 (2). If ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper V Superscript perpendicularCe(h) ∩V ⊥is a spectrahedral shadow, then so is ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis commaCe(h), by 
Theorem 3.5 (4). Thus, with a suitable choice of coordinates and using Exercise B.3 
(4), we may assume that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisCe(h) is pointed. This implies that there exists an afﬁne 
hyperplane upper H subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1H ⊆Rn+1 with e element of upper He ∈H, 0 not an element of upper H0 /∈H such that 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis equals c o n e left parenthesis ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper H right parenthesisCe(h) = cone(Ce(h) ∩H)
and such that ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HCe(h) ∩H is compact (c.f. Proposition B.1). 
Now Lemma 3.56 says that h vertical bar Subscript upper H Baselineh|H is strictly quasi-concave at all points of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HCe(h) ∩
H. Furthermore, given u element of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis minus StartSet 0 EndSetu ∈Ce(h) \ {0} with h left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0h(u) = 0, there exists a radius epsilonε such 
that

because t equals 0t = 0 is a simple root of h left parenthesis u plus t e right parenthesish(u+te) by Lemma 3.55. In other words, h locally 
describes the hyperbolicity cone by nonnegativity. Since the deﬁning polynomial

of the closed ball ModifyingAbove upper B With quotation dash Subscript epsilon Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesisBε(u) is everywhere strictly quasi-concave, we may apply 
Corollary 3.51 and conclude that 
ModifyingAbove upper B With quotation dash Subscript epsilon Baseline intersection ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HBε ∩Ce(h) ∩H
possesses an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation, and this thus a spectrahedral shadow. 
Using the compactness of the boundary of ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HCe(h) ∩H in H, we can write ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HCe(h) ∩H

(6), we see that 
ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper HCe(h) ∩H
is a spectrahedral shadow. Hence so is ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis equals c o n e left parenthesis ModifyingAbove script upper C With quotation dash Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis intersection upper H right parenthesisCe(h) = cone(Ce(h) ∩H), by Theorem 3.5

3.7
Necessary Conditions for Exactness 
So far we have only seen sufﬁcient conditions for the exactness of the Lasserre-
Parrilo relaxations, but not a single example in which it demonstrably fails to 
become exact. In this chapter, we will ﬁll this gap. Note however that the results in 
this section do not imply that the corresponding sets are not spectrahedral shadows! 
They just say that the very convenient relaxation method of Lasserre and Parrilo 
fails to prove this property (see Examples 3.62 and 3.65). 
The principal obstruction against exactness is the following result from [31]. 
Proposition 3.60 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS = S(p) ⊆Rn and let upper Z subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nZ ⊆Rn be a line, such that upper S intersection upper ZS ∩Z has non-empty 
interior in Z. Assume that there exists a point u 0 element of upper S commau0 ∈S, in the relative boundary 
of c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis intersection upper Z commaclos(conv(S)) ∩Z, such that the gradients nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis∇pi(u0) are orthogonal to upper Z commaZ,
whenever p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis equals 0pi(u0) = 0. Then 
c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or not equals script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisclos(conv(S)) ⊊R[d](p)
for all d greater than or slanted equals 1d ⩾1, i.e., no Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with respect to p is exact. 
Proof Let Z and u 0u0 be as in the hypothesis. After a change of coordinates, we may 
assume u 0 equals 0u0 = 0 and upper Z equals StartSet u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar u 2 equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals u Subscript n Baseline equals 0 EndSetZ = {u ∈Rn | u2 = · · · = un = 0}. We may further assume 
that u 1 greater than or slanted equals 0u1 ⩾0 holds for all u element of c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis intersection upper Zu ∈clos(conv(S)) ∩Z. Let  q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x 1 right bracketq1, . . . , qr ∈R[x1] be the 
polynomials obtained from p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr by setting the last n minus 1n −1 variables to zero. 
We claim that 
script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection upper ZR[d](q) ⊆R[d](p) ∩Z
holds for any d greater than or slanted equals 1d ⩾1. To see this, let u element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisu ∈R[d](q), i.e., u equals left parenthesis upper L left parenthesis x 1 right parenthesis comma 0 comma ellipsis comma 0 right parenthesisu = (L(x1), 0, . . . , 0) for 
some 
upper L element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis Superscript prime Baseline subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x 1 right bracket Superscript asterisk Baseline periodL ∈QM[d](q)′ ⊆R[x1]∗.

Then L extends to upper L 0 element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Superscript asteriskL0 ∈R[x]∗via upper L 0 left parenthesis g right parenthesis colon equals upper L left parenthesis g left parenthesis x 1 comma 0 comma ellipsis comma 0 right parenthesis right parenthesisL0(g) := L(g(x1, 0, . . . , 0)) for g element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketg ∈R[x]. We  
have upper L 0 element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Superscript prime Baseline commaL0 ∈QM[d](p)′, since g left parenthesis x 1 comma 0 comma ellipsis comma 0 right parenthesis element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisg(x1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈QM[d](q) for any g element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisg ∈QM[d](p). 
Thus 
u equals left parenthesis upper L 0 left parenthesis x 1 right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma upper L 0 left parenthesis x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodu = (L0(x1), . . . , L0(xn)) ∈R[d](p).
Now set upper S prime colon equals upper S intersection upper Z equals script upper S left parenthesis q right parenthesisS′ := S ∩Z = S(q). If  c o n v left parenthesis upper S prime right parenthesisconv(S′) is some closed interval left bracket 0 comma c right bracket comma[0, c], then set 
q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline equals c minus x 1qr+1 = c −x1. Otherwise, i.e., if c o n v left parenthesis upper S prime right parenthesis equals left bracket 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesisconv(S′) = [0, ∞), set  q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline equals 1qr+1 = 1 (just to keep 
the notation uniform). Then script upper S left parenthesis q right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisS(q) = S(q, qr+1) and script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesisR[d](q, qr+1) ⊆R[d](q). By  
Proposition 3.18, and since upper S primeS′ has an interior point by assumption, 
script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesis equals c o n v left parenthesis upper S prime right parenthesisR[d](q, qr+1) = conv(S′)
holds if and only if every script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x 1 right bracketℓ∈R[x1] of degree 1, that is nonnegative on upper S prime commaS′, belongs 
to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisQM[d](q, qr+1). So consider script l equals x 1ℓ= x1, which is nonnegative on upper S primeS′, and suppose 
there exists a representation 
x 1 equals sigma plus sigma summation Underscript i element of upper I Endscripts sigma Subscript i Baseline q Subscript i Baseline plus sigma summation Underscript i element of upper J Endscripts sigma Subscript i Baseline q Subscript i Baseline commax1 = σ +

where i element of upper Ii ∈I if p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0pi(0) = 0 and i element of upper Ji ∈J if p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis greater than 0pi(0) > 0 (and sigma comma sigma Subscript i Baselineσ, σi are sums of squares). 
For i element of upper Ji ∈J, q Subscript iqi has a positive constant term, so sigma Subscript iσi cannot have a constant term, and its 
homogeneous part of minimal degree must thus be at least quadratic. The same is 
true for sigmaσ. So none of the elements sigmaσ and sigma Subscript i Baseline q Subscript i Baseline commaσiqi, where i element of upper J commai ∈J, contains the monomial 
x 1x1. But by hypothesis, nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis∇pi(0) is orthogonal to the x 1x1-axis for all i element of upper Ii ∈I, which 
implies that the terms of q Subscript iqi have all degree at least 2. This is a contradiction, and 
thus script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisR[d](q, qr+1) strictly contains c o n v left parenthesis upper S prime right parenthesisconv(S′). 
Since q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisqr+1 ∈QM[d](q, qr+1), a point larger than c does not lie in script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesisR[d](q, qr+1). 
Thus there exists some negative b with 
b element of script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q comma q Subscript r plus 1 Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection upper Z periodb ∈R[d](q, qr+1) ⊆R[d](q) ⊆R[d](p) ∩Z.
But since left parenthesis b comma 0 comma ellipsis comma 0 right parenthesis not element of c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis(b, 0, . . . , 0) ̸∈clos(conv(S)) by hypothesis, this proves c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or not equals script upper R Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisclos(conv(S)) ⊊
R[d](p). 
⊓⊔
Corollary 3.61

Spectrahedral Shadows
Proof Apply Proposition 3.60 to any line Z through u 0u0 and i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisint(S). 
⊓⊔
Example 3.62 
Let p equals x 1 cubed left parenthesis 1 minus x 1 right parenthesis minus x 2 squaredp = x3
1(1 −x1) −x2
2 and put upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p). The origin is a singular point of script upper V left parenthesis p right parenthesisV(p), i.e., 
p left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0p(0) = 0 and nabla p left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0∇p(0) = 0. So no Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation of c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) with respect to p is 
exact. 
But a quick computation shows that 
c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis p comma 2 x 1 minus 1 right parenthesis union script upper S left parenthesis 2 x 2 plus x 1 comma x 1 minus 2 x 2 comma 1 minus 2 x 1 right parenthesis periodconv(S) = S(p, 2x1 −1) ∪S(2x2 + x1, x1 −2x2, 1 −2x1).
The second set in the union is just a triangle, while the other possesses an exact Lasserre 
relaxation by Corollary 3.51 (see Exercise 3.63). 
Exercise 3.63 
Show that c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) in Example 3.62 is a spectrahedral shadow. 
The necessary condition for exactness in Proposition 3.60 and Corollary 3.61 
depends on the description of the basic closed set S. But there is also a more 
intrinsic geometric condition. We have seen in Theorem 2.26 that spectrahedra 
have only exposed faces. This does not carry over to spectrahedral shadows in 
general, since projections of exposed faces need not be exposed (see Example 3.65 
below). But in fact it carries over to convex sets having an exact Lasserre-Parrilo 
relaxation. This was ﬁrst shown in [68], but can now easily be deduced from 
Proposition 3.60. 
Theorem 3.64 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) be convex with non-empty interior. If S has a non-exposed face, 
then no Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation of S with respect to p is exact. 
Proof Let upper F subset of or equal to upper SF ⊆S be a non-exposed face. By Proposition B.18 (6), there exists

and u 0u0 is a point in the relative boundary of upper S intersection upper ZS ∩Z. So the claim follows from 
Proposition 3.60, once we have veriﬁed the condition on the gradients. Suppose 
that p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis equals 0pi(u0) = 0 for some i. Since S is convex and p Subscript i Baseline vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0pi|S ⩾0, we must have  
nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline left parenthesis u minus u 0 right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0∇pi(u0)T (u −u0) ⩾0 for all u element of upper Su ∈S. In other words, the polynomial 
script l colon equals nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis Superscript upper T Baseline left parenthesis x minus u 0 right parenthesis element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ:= ∇pi(u0)T (x −u0) ∈R[x]1
is nonnegative on S. Since u 0 element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper F right parenthesisu0 ∈relint(F) and script l left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis equals 0ℓ(u0) = 0, we must have  script l vertical bar Subscript upper F Baseline equals 0ℓ|F = 0
and hence also script l vertical bar Subscript upper F Sub Superscript prime Subscript Baseline equals 0ℓ|F ′ = 0. So script lℓvanishes in both u 0u0 and u 1u1, and thus on all of Z. But  
this implies that nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis∇pi(u0) is orthogonal to Z. 
⊓⊔
Example 3.65 
Returning to the convex set 
upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis x 2 minus x 1 cubed comma 1 plus x 1 comma 1 minus x 1 comma x 2 comma 1 minus x 2 right parenthesis periodS = S(x2 −x3
1, 1 + x1, 1 −x1, x2, 1 −x2).
from Example 2.28, we conclude from Theorem 3.64 that S cannot have an exact Lasserre-
Parrilo relaxation with respect to the given deﬁning polynomials, or any other description as 
a basic closed semialgebraic set. This is because the origin is a non-exposed face of S. 
However, S is the convex hull of the square left bracket negative 1 comma 0 right bracket times left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket[−1, 0]×[0, 1] and the basic closed semialgebraic 
set upper S intersection script upper S left parenthesis x 1 right parenthesisS∩S(x1), both of which are spectrahedral shadows. This is clear for the ﬁrst, while for the 
second we gave an explicit proof in Example 3.21. So by Theorem 3.5 (6), S is a spectrahedral 
shadow. 
Exercise 3.66 
Find an example of a speactrahedron in double struck upper R cubed commaR3, whose projection onto the ﬁrst two 
coordinates has a non-exposed face.
▶Remarks 3.67 
1. Note that Theorem 3.64 only applies when upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) is already convex. It 
may in fact happen that c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) has an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with 
respect to p, even when c o n v left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisconv(S) has a non-exposed face. The football stadium 
from Exercise 2.24 can be written as c o n v left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisconv(S(p)) with 
p equals minus left parenthesis left parenthesis x 1 plus 1 right parenthesis squared plus x 2 squared minus 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis left parenthesis x 1 minus 1 right parenthesis squared plus x 2 squared minus 1 right parenthesis periodp = −((x1 + 1)2 + x2

Spectrahedral Shadows
Here, Proposition 3.18 and an explicit calculation can be used to show 
c o n v left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesis equals script upper R Subscript left bracket 4 right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis commaconv(S(p)) = R[4](p),
see [31], Proposition 4.12. 
2. Furthermore, Theorem 3.64 only applies when the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation 
is indeed exact. An inexact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation of a convex basic closed 
set may well have non-exposed faces. For example, the set in Example 3.65 
has a Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation with a non-exposed face, see [31], Corollary 
4.11. 
3.8
Generalized Relaxations and Scheiderer’s 
Counterexamples 
As we have seen in Sect. 3.7, the existence of an exact Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation 
is only sufﬁcient, but not necessary for a set to be a spectrahedral shadow. 
Only when generalizing the above notion of relaxation, both properties indeed 
become equivalent. This approach can then be used to show that certain convex 
semialgebraic sets are indeed not spectrahedral shadows, answering a question from 
[65], and refuting the Helton-Nie conjecture [41, 42]. This was ﬁrst achieved by 
Scheiderer in [99]. Our presentation follows the similar but slightly more elementary 
approach from [26]. 
The ﬁrst result can be seen as a generalization of Proposition 3.18, using  
semialgebraic functions instead of just polynomials to construct a relaxation. In this 
setting, the existence of bounded degree sums-of-squares representations for linear 
polynomials is really equivalent to being a spectrahedral shadow. For simplicity, we 
restrict to convex cones. 
Proposition 3.68 
Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be a semialgebraic set, and let script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisFsa(S) denote the double struck upper RR-algebra 
of real-valued semialgebraic functions on S. Then the following are equiva-
lent: 
1. .clos(cone(S)) is a spectrahedral shadow. 
2. There exists a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace upper W subset of or equal to script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisW ⊆Fsa(S) with script l Subscript vertical bar Sub Subscript upper S Subscript Baseline element of upper Sigma upper W squaredℓ|S ∈W 2
for every script l element of upper S Superscript orℓ∈S∨. 
Proof We have seen that (2) implies (1) in several variants throughout this book 
already: The set upper Sigma upper W squaredW 2 is a spectrahedral shadow, by a similar construction as 
Example 2.2 (4). By assumption (2), the cone upper S Superscript orS∨is the inverse image of upper Sigma upper W squaredW 2

all these functions, the claim follows.

Spectrahedral Shadows
▶Remark 3.69 Every ﬁnite-dimensional space upper W subset of or equal to script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisW ⊆Fsa(S) gives rise to an outer 
relaxation of c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesisclos (cone(S)) by a spectrahedral shadow, by the construction in the 
ﬁrst part of the proof. To be more explicit, we take all linear functionals on double struck upper R Superscript nRn that 
belong to upper Sigma upper W squaredW 2, and consider their joint nonnegativity set. This is a spectrahedral 
shadow containing c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesisclos (cone(S)). 
If upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) is basic closed, we can take W to be the space spanned by all 
functions of the form 
q StartRoot p Subscript i Baseline EndRoot element of script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisq√pi ∈Fsa(S)
where q is a polynomial with degree left parenthesis q right parenthesis less than or slanted equals one half left parenthesis d minus degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesisdeg(q) ⩽1
2(d −deg(pi)). Then upper Sigma upper W squaredW 2 contains 
all functions from upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p), and the generalized relaxation deﬁned by W thus 
contains the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation deﬁned by upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p), in the sense of 
Remark 3.23. In this sense we consider generalized relaxations, and we have 
shown that being a spectrahedral shadow is really equivalent to having an exact 
generalized relaxation. 
The following theorem is the ﬁrst result that formulates an unavoidable obstruc-
tion to being a spectrahedral shadow. We will see explicit examples of such sets 
below. 
Theorem 3.70 
Let h element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketh ∈R[x] be homogeneous, globally nonnegative, but not a sum of squares 
in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. Let upper V equals s p a n left brace q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript m Baseline right brace subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketV = span{q1, . . . , qm} ⊆R[x] be a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace 
that contains all translates 
h Subscript u Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals h left parenthesis x minus u right parenthesishu(x) := h(x −u)
for u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn, and let q equals left parenthesis q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript m Baseline right parenthesis colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript mq = (q1, . . . , qm): Rn →Rm be the corresponding 
polynomial map. Then for every semialgebraic set upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn with nonempty 
interior, the set 
c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis q left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript mclos (cone(q(S))) ⊆Rm
is a closed semialgebraic convex cone, but not a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof Assume for contradiction that c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis q left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesisclos (cone(q(S))) is a spectrahedral shadow. 
We apply Proposition 3.68 to q left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisq(S), pull everything back to S via q, and obtain a 
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace upper X subset of or equal to script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisX ⊆Fsa(S), such that every polynomial from V that is 
nonnegative on S belongs to upper Sigma upper X squaredX2. 
Let X be spanned by the semialgebraic functions f 1 comma ellipsis comma f Subscript r Baselinef1, . . . , fr. Since semialgebraic 
functions are smooth almost everywhere (see Theorem A.6), there is a point u element of upper Su ∈S at

3.8
Generalized Relaxations and Scheiderer’s Counterexamples
113
which all f Subscript ifi are smooth. The polynomial h Subscript uhu is nonnegative on S and therefore a sum 
of squares of elements from X. It is also homogeneous with respect to u, and after 
a shift we can thus assume without loss of generality that u equals 0u = 0 (here we have used  
that V contains all translates of h). If a homogeneous polynomial is a sum of squares 
of functions that are smooth at the origin, it is a sum of squares of polynomials 
already. This follows by simply comparing the nontrivial homogeneous terms of 
lowest degree of the Taylor expansions. This yields the desired contradiction. 
⊓⊔
One can get rid of the homogeneity assumption on h in the last theorem, at the 
cost of some more technical difﬁculties. This will reduce the size of n by one in the 
following corollaries. We refer the reader to [26,99] for these improvements. 
Corollary 3.71 
Let either n greater than or slanted equals 3n ⩾3 and d greater than or slanted equals 6d ⩾6, or  n greater than or slanted equals 4n ⩾4 and d greater than or slanted equals 4d ⩾4, and let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be a 
semialgebraic set with nonempty interior. Then

applies in particular to upper S equals double struck upper R Superscript nS = Rn. 
Proof In the speciﬁed cases, there exist nonnegative homogeneous polynomials in

the Motzkin form

Corollary 3.76 
For n greater than or slanted equals 4n ⩾4, the cone upper S e p Subscript n comma n Baseline subset of or equal to upper H e r Subscript n squaredSepn,n ⊆Hern2 is not a spectrahedral shadow. 
Proof If upper S e p Subscript n comma nSepn,n was a spectrahedral shadow, so would be its dual in upper H e r Subscript n Baseline circled times upper H e r Subscript nHern ⊗Hern
(where we use the trace inner product on matrix spaces). The dual is the cone of 
so-called block positive matrices, i.e., matrices which are nonnegative as quadratic 
forms only on elementary tensors v circled times wv ⊗w of vectors. This uses the fact that upper S e p Subscript n comma nSepn,n is 
spanned as a convex cone by matrices of the form 
v v Superscript asterisk circled times w w Superscript asteriskvv∗⊗ww∗
with v comma w element of double struck upper C Superscript nv, w ∈Cn. 
The space upper H e r Subscript n Baseline circled times upper H e r Subscript nHern ⊗Hern canonically projects onto the space of biquadratic forms 
in double struck upper R left bracket x comma y right bracketR[x, y], by contracting the ﬁrst tensor factor with the vector of variables x, and 
the second with y. The cone upper S e p Subscript n comma n Superscript orSep∨
n,n of block-positive matrices is thereby mapped 
onto the cone of nonnegative biquadratic forms. In Corollary 3.72 we have seen that 
this is not a spectrahedral shadow, and so neither is upper S e p Subscript n comma n Superscript orSep∨
n,n and upper S e p Subscript n comma nSepn,n.

Spectrahedral Shadows
Note that the last statement is clearly also true for symmetric instead of Hermitian 
matrices. Since separable matrices play an important role in quantum physics, and it 
is common to consider Hermitian matrices there, we stated the results for Hermitian 
matrices only.
▶Remark 3.77 The given counterexamples show an interesting pattern. A com-
mon theme in polynomial optimization has recently been to transform hard 
optimization problems to easier semideﬁnite problems, by using sums-of-squares 
certiﬁcates instead of positivity (see for example [58] for a comprehensive 
overview). However, this approach is in general not equivalent to the initial 
problem, since sums-of-squares certiﬁcates usually fail to exist for all nonneg-
ative polynomials. The Peres-Horodecki criterion for separability [48, 80] is of  
the same spirit. Corollaries 3.71 and 3.76 (to be precise: the versions with n 
reduced by one, which we did not prove) state that exactly in the cases where 
the approaches become non-equivalent, the corresponding set of nonnegative 
polynomials and separable psd matrices are also not a spectrahedral shadows. 
So it seems like the hard problems resist being made simple.
▶Remark 3.78 A completely different approach to the problem in this section, 
using the Tarski principle and convex separation over real closed ﬁelds, has 
recently been developed by Bodirsky et al. in [11]. This has also produced new 
counterexamples, notably the cone of copositive matrices of size 5 times 55 × 5.

This section contains a short introduction to concepts and results from real algebra 
and geometry, with a special focus on (Matrix-)Positivstellensätze, stability of 
quadratic modules, and sums of squares on curves. The reader who wants to learn 
more about this exciting topic is referred to the books [10,63,83]. 
A.1 
Semialgebraic Sets, Semialgebraic Mappings 
and Dimension 
Recall that a basic closed semialgebraic set is deﬁned as 
script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis equals left brace u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar p 1 left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right brace commaS(p) = S(p1, . . . , pr) =

u ∈Rn | p1(u) ⩾0, . . . , pr(u) ⩾0

,
for p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) with all p Subscript i Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketpi ∈R[x]. A general semialgebraic set is a 
(ﬁnite) Boolean combination of basic closed semialgebraic sets. The Projection 
Theorem 1.2 states that projections of semialgebraic sets are again semialgebraic. 
This innocent-looking result is in fact not completely trivial to prove, and has 
many strong implications, see [10, 63, 83] for more details. For our purpose, 
the most relevant implications are that closure, interior, convex hulls, and many 
more constructions with semialgebraic sets again produce semialgebraic sets (see 
Example 1.4). 
Deﬁnition A.1 
The dimension dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisdim(S) of a semialgebraic set is the dimension of the double struck upper RR-Zariski 
closure of S, as an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety. This coincides for example with the maximal 
length of a chain of prime ideals in the ring double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket divided by script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis commaR[x]/I(S), where script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisI(S) is the ideal 
of real polynomials vanishing on S.

For example, if upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn has nonempty interior (with respect to the Euclidean 
topology), then dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals ndim(S) = n. 
Deﬁnition A.2 
Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be a semialgebraic set. Then f colon upper S right arrow double struck upper R Superscript mf : S →Rm is called a semialgebraic 
mapping if its graph 
upper Gamma left parenthesis f right parenthesis colon equals StartSet left parenthesis u comma f left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis vertical bar u element of upper S EndSet(f ) := {(u, f (u)) | u ∈S}
is a semialgebraic subset of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times double struck upper R Superscript m Baseline equals double struck upper R Superscript n plus m Baseline periodRn × Rm = Rn+m.
Exercise A.3 
Show the following: 
1. Componentwise polynomial mappings are semialgebraic. 
2. The square-root function StartRoot EndRoot colon left bracket 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis right arrow left bracket 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis√: [0, ∞) →[0, ∞) is semialgebraic. 
3. The square-root mapping StartRoot EndRoot colon upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus Baseline right arrow upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plus√: Sym+
s →Sym+
s is semialgebraic (where both sets 
are understood as subsets of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline approximately equals double struck upper R Superscript s left parenthesis s plus 1 right parenthesis divided by 2Syms ∼= Rs(s+1)/2). 
4. Let upper T subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus mT ⊆Rn+m be a closed semialgebraic set, and upper S colon equals pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS := πx(T ) ⊆Rn. Then there 
exists a semialgebraic mapping s colon upper S right arrow double struck upper R Superscript n plus ms : S →Rn+m with 
s left parenthesis u right parenthesis element of upper T and pi Subscript x Baseline left parenthesis s left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis equals us(u) ∈T and πx(s(u)) = u
for all u element of upper Su ∈S. 
Theorem A.4 
If f colon upper S right arrow double struck upper R Superscript mf : S →Rm is a semialgebraic mapping, then dimension left parenthesis f left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis less than or slanted equals dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis perioddim (f (S)) ⩽dim(S).
Proof See [10], Theorem 2.8.8. 
⊓⊔
Proposition A.5 
For a semialgebraic set S, the  set  
script upper F Subscript s a Baseline left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis colon equals left brace f colon upper S right arrow double struck upper R vertical bar f semialgebraic right braceFsa(S) := {f : S →R | f semialgebraic}

Theorem A.6 
Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be a semialgebraic set with nonempty interior and let f colon upper S right arrow double struck upper Rf : S →R
be a semialgebraic function. Then f is smooth in all points of S outside a 
semialgebraic subset of dimension less than n< n. 
Proof This follows for example from [39], Theorem 1.7, or from more general 
decomposition results such as [10], § 9.1, applied to the graph of f .

Positive Polynomials and Quadratic Modules 
Throughout this section let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be a tuple of polynomials from double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket commaR[x],
and let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS = S(p) ⊆Rn be the basic closed set deﬁned by p. Let  
script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis colon equals StartSet p element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket vertical bar p left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 for all u element of upper S EndSetP(S) :=

be the set of non-negative polynomials on S (which we also call the saturated 
preordering of S). Understanding the structure of script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) is a central goal of real 
algebra and geometry, for which we introduce some standard notions. 
Deﬁnition A.7 
A quadratic module in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] (or indeed in any commutative ring with 1) is a 
subset upper Q subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketQ ⊆R[x] such that 
1. .1 ∈Q, 
2. .Q + Q ⊆Q, 
3. .p2Q ⊆Q for all p element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketp ∈R[x]. 
A quadratic module is called a preordering if 
4. .Q · Q ⊆Q. 
It is clear that script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) above is a preordering. The cone upper Sigma of sums of squares is the 
smallest preordering, contained in all quadratic modules in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. More generally, 
the set 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis colon equals left brace sigma 0 plus sigma 1 p 1 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus sigma Subscript r Baseline p Subscript r Baseline vertical bar sigma 0 comma ellipsis comma sigma Subscript r Baseline element of upper Sigma right brace QM(p) :=

is clearly the smallest quadratic module containing all p Subscript ipi, called the quadratic 
module generated by p. The preordering generated by p is the quadratic module 
generated by all ﬁnite products of the p Subscript ipi: 
upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesis colon equals left brace sigma summation Underscript e element of left brace 0 comma 1 right brace Superscript r Baseline Endscripts sigma Subscript e Baseline p 1 Superscript e 1 Baseline midline horizontal ellipsis p Subscript r Superscript e Super Subscript r Superscript Baseline vertical bar sigma Subscript i Baseline element of upper Sigma right brace periodPO(p) :=


.
In particular, it is also ﬁnitely generated as a quadratic module. 
Notation A.8 We will always implicitly deﬁne p 0 equals 1p0 = 1, so that an element of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p)
can be written in the form sigma summation Underscript i equals 0 Overscript r Endscripts sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript ir
i=0 σipi with sigma Subscript i Baseline element of upper Sigmaσi ∈. 
Now it is clear from the deﬁnition that 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to script upper P left parenthesis script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis right parenthesisQM(p) ⊆PO(p) ⊆P(S(p))
holds. Much research in real algebra and geometry revolves around the question of 
how close these inclusions are to equality. 
Example A.9 
1. Every non-negative polynomial in one variable is a sum of (two) squares of polynomials, 
so for upper S equals double struck upper RS = R we have script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals upper SigmaP(S) = . This becomes false in higher dimensions, i.e., upper Sigma subset of or not equals script upper P left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right parenthesis ⊊
P(Rn) for n greater than or slanted equals 2n ⩾2, by a classical result of Hilbert. 
2. Every q element of double struck upper R left bracket x 1 right bracketq ∈R[x1] with q vertical bar Subscript left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0q|[0,1] ⩾0 is contained in upper Q upper M left parenthesis x 1 left parenthesis 1 minus x 1 right parenthesis right parenthesisQM(x1(1−x1)), i.e., has a representation 
q equals sigma 0 plus sigma 1 dot x left parenthesis 1 minus x right parenthesisq = σ0 + σ1 · x(1 −x)
for sigma 0 comma sigma 1 element of upper Sigmaσ0, σ1 ∈. For general subsets of the line, see [63], §2.7. 
Exercise A.10 
Show that script upper P left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis equals upper SigmaP(R) =  and script upper P left parenthesis left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket right parenthesis equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis x 1 left parenthesis 1 minus x 1 right parenthesis right parenthesisP([0, 1]) = QM(x1(1 −x1)) as claimed above. 
An important general result, which triggered a lot of further research on positive 
polynomials and sums of squares, is the following, often called Schmüdgen’s 
Positivstellensatz. 
Theorem A.11 (Schmüdgen’s Positivstellensatz) 
If script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS(p) ⊆Rn is bounded, the preordering upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesisPO(p) contains all polynomials 
q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈R[x] with q left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0q(u) > 0 for all u element of script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisu ∈S(p).

Proof See for example [63], Corollary 6.1.2, or [83], Theorem 5.2.9. 
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition A.12 
A quadratic module Q in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] is called Archimedean if it contains a polynomial g 
such that script upper S left parenthesis g right parenthesisS(g) is bounded. If upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is Archimedean, we also say that p provides 
an Archimedean description of the (compact) set script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p). 
Note that this Archimedean property is often deﬁned in a different way, but our 
deﬁnition is equivalent and most easy to state (see [63], Theorem 7.1.1, or [83], 
Theorem 5.3.8). A version of Schmüdgen’s Positivstellensatz for quadratic modules 
is the following. Instead of boundedness of script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) it requires the quadratic module 
upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) to be Archimedean. 
Theorem A.13 (Putinar’s Positivstellensatz) 
If the quadratic module upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is Archimedean, then it contains all polyno-
mials q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈R[x] with q left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0q(u) > 0 for all u element of script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisu ∈S(p). 
Proof See for example [63], Theorem 5.6.1, or [83], Theorem 5.3.8. 
⊓⊔
Corollary A.14 
A ﬁnitely generated quadratic module Q in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] is Archimedean if and only 
if there exists a number lamdaλ such that lamda squared minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts x Subscript i Superscript 2λ2 −n
i=1 x2
i is contained in Q. 
Proof One direction is obvious from the deﬁnition, the other one follows directly 
from Theorem A.13.
⊓⊔
▶Remark A.15 Given Putinar’s Theorem, Schmüdgen’s Theorem can be 
rephrased as saying that upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesisPO(p) is Archimedean whenever script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) is bounded. 
One can ﬁnd examples of such p for which upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is not Archimedean, which 
shows that Schmüdgen’s Theorem does not extend to quadratic modules without 
additional assumptions. 
For practical purposes, if S is bounded, the assumption that Q is Archimedean is 
often considered quite mild, since one can just add the polynomial lamda squared minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript r Endscripts x Subscript i Superscript 2λ2 −r
i=1 x2
i
to the description of upper S commaS, if upper S subset of or equal to upper B Subscript lamda Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesisS ⊆Bλ(0). Since the representation of a positive 
polynomial in the quadratic module is simpler than in the preordering (r plus 1r + 1
summands instead of 2 Superscript r2r), the use of quadratic modules is often preferred. 
On the other hand, we have the following negative result by Scheiderer.

122
A
Real Algebraic Geometry
Theorem A.16 
If S is of dimension at least 3, then script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) is not a ﬁnitely generated quadratic 
module. In other words, for any description upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p) there exists q element of script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisq ∈P(S)
with q not an element of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisq /∈QM(p). 
Proof See [63], Proposition 2.6.2. 
⊓⊔
Of course, if S is bounded, then any q element of script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis minus upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesisq ∈P(S) \ PO(p) must necessarily have a 
zero somewhere in S, by Schmügen’s Theorem. 
Note that the cone script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP(S) lives in the inﬁnite-dimensional vector space double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. What 
if instead we consider the ﬁnite-dimensional slices? 
Proposition A.17 
The set 
script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript d colon equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dP(S)d := P(S) ∩R[x]d
is a closed and semialgebraic convex cone in the ﬁnite-dimensional real 
vector space double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dR[x]d. 
Proof For each point u element of double struck upper R Superscript nu ∈Rn, let upper L Subscript u Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Superscript asteriskLu ∈R[x]∗
d be the linear functional q right arrow from bar q left parenthesis u right parenthesisq →q(u). 
Then we can write 
script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript d Baseline equals intersection Underscript u element of upper S Endscripts upper L Subscript u Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis left bracket 0 comma normal infinity right parenthesis right parenthesis periodP(S)d =

u∈S
L−1
u ([0, ∞)).
Since the functionals upper L Subscript uLu are continuous, this expresses script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript dP(S)d as an intersection of 
closed halfspaces, hence it is a closed convex cone. Furthermore, the projection onto 
the ﬁrst factor of the set 
left brace left parenthesis q comma u comma q left parenthesis u right parenthesis right parenthesis vertical bar q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline comma u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right brace intersection left parenthesis double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline times upper S times left parenthesis negative normal infinity comma 0 right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline times double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times double struck upper R

(q, u, q(u)) | q ∈R[x]d, u ∈Rn
∩(R[x]d × S × (−∞, 0)) ⊆R[x]d × Rn × R
is semialgebraic, and it is the complement of script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript dP(S)d inside double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dR[x]d. So script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript dP(S)d is 
semialgebraic. 
⊓⊔
While script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis Subscript dP(S)d is a closed and semialgebraic convex cone, it is usually not even a 
spectrahedral shadow, as shown in Corollary 3.71. So how about ﬁnitely generated 
quadratic modules instead? Let us consider 
upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis colon equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline period QMd(p) := QM(p) ∩R[x]d.

and compare it to the cone

in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dR[x]d, which we call the truncation of degree d of upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) (with respect to p). 
For general quadratic modules, it is not true that upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) = QMd(p) or even that 
upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQMd(p) is contained in upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[e](p) for some e greater than or slanted equals de ⩾d. 
Example A.18 
Let p equals left parenthesis x left parenthesis 1 minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis cubedp = (x(1 −x))3 and upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketQ = QM(p) ⊆R[x] in the polynomial ring in one variable, 
describing the closed interval script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracketS(p) = [0, 1]. It is not hard to check that x not an element of upper Qx /∈Q. For suppose 
we had 
x equals sigma 0 plus sigma 1 px = σ0 + σ1p
with sigma 0 comma sigma 1 element of upper Sigmaσ0, σ1 ∈, then since x divides p, we could conclude that x also divides sigma 0σ0. Since sigma 0σ0
is a sum of squares, this really implies that x squaredx2 divides sigma 0σ0 (give an argument why!). So the 
right hand side would be divisible by x squaredx2, a contradiction. 
On the other hand, Q is a preordering (since there is only one generator) and script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracketS(p) = [0, 1]
is bounded, so Q contains all strictly positive polynomials by Schmüdgen’s Theorem A.11. 
In particular, x plus epsilon element of upper Qx + ε ∈Q holds for all epsilon greater than 0ε > 0. Now, if we had x plus epsilon element of upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisx + ε ∈QM[e](p) for all epsilon greater than 0ε > 0
and ﬁxed e greater than or slanted equals 0e ⩾0, we could write 
x plus epsilon equals sigma Subscript 0 comma epsilon Baseline plus sigma Subscript 1 comma epsilon Baseline px + ε = σ0,ε + σ1,εp
with all degree left parenthesis sigma Subscript 0 comma epsilon Baseline right parenthesis comma degree left parenthesis sigma Subscript 1 comma epsilon Baseline right parenthesis plus 3 less than or slanted equals edeg(σ0,ε), deg(σ1,ε) + 3 ⩽e. We could then (carefully!) take limits as epsilon right arrow 0ε →0
and conclude x element of upper Qx ∈Q, a contradiction. That last argument is made precise in the following 
proposition. 
Proposition A.19 
If upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection minus upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals StartSet 0 EndSetQM(p) ∩−QM(p) = {0}, then the convex cone upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket d right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[d](p) is closed in 
double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dR[x]d, for all d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0. 
Proof See for example [63], Lemma 4.1.4.
⊓⊔

Real Algebraic Geometry
Deﬁnition A.20 
Let upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQ = QM(p) be a ﬁnitely generated quadratic module. For each integer d, 
we say that Q is d-stable with respect to p commap, if there exists an integer e greater than or slanted equals 0e ⩾0 such 
that 
upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodQMd(p) ⊆QM[e](p).
So this means that the elements of degree at most d from Q all admit 
representations with degrees of all terms sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript iσipi bounded by e. In particular, the 
degrees of the sums of squares sigma Subscript iσi are bounded by e minus degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesise −deg(pi). 
We say that Q is stable if it is d-stable for all d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0. To rephrase, this means that 
every polynomial p in Q must admit a representation p equals p 0 sigma 0 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus p Subscript r Baseline sigma Subscript rp = p0σ0 + · · · + prσr
in which the degree of each summand sigma Subscript i Baseline p Subscript iσipi is bounded by a function depending 
only on the degree of p. 
Note that if upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQMd(p) ⊆QM[e](p), then 
upper Q upper M Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline periodQMd(p) = QM[e](p) ∩R[x]d.
It is also not hard to show that whether Q is stable does not depend on the choice 
of generators p. However, the notion of d-stability for ﬁxed d does depend on the 
choice of generators. 
Exercise A.21 
Show that stability is independent of the choice of generators. 
We will discuss a model-theoretic characterization of stability in Sect. A.4 below. 
For now let us mention that for bounded sets script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p), stability of the corresponding 
quadratic module upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is only possible in exceptional situations of small 
dimension: 
Exercise A.22 
Use Theorem A.11, Theorem A.16 and Proposition A.19 to show: If script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS(p) is 
bounded of dimension at least 3, then upper P upper O left parenthesis p right parenthesisPO(p) is not stable (and neither is upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p), if  
the description is Archimedean.) This is in fact also true in dimension 2, by a result 
of Scheiderer [95]. 
In Chap. 3.3, we showed that proving exactness of the Lasserre-Parrilo relaxation 
for the convex hull of a bounded basic closed semialgebraic set is equivalent to 
establishing 1-stability for the corresponding (Archimedean) quadratic module. This 
is basically the statement of Proposition 3.18, using also Putinar’s Theorem A.13. 
In other words, we need uniform degree bounds for representations of supporting 
hyperplanes obtained from Putinar’s (or Schmüdgen’s) Theorem. On the other hand, 
we have already seen, in Example A.18 and much more generally in Exercise A.22,

A
Real Algebraic Geometry
125
that such degree bounds cannot exist in great generality, i.e., for polynomials of 
arbitrary degree in arbitrary dimensions. 
However, there do in fact exist non-uniform degree bounds, i.e., depending on 
other data than just the degree of the represented polynomial. For some of the results 
in Chap. 3, this was indeed all we needed to know. The following result is from [74]. 
We indicate below the much more elementary proof from [52]. 
Theorem A.23 (Putinar’s Positivstellensatz with Degree Bounds) 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be an Archimedean description of the set upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p). 
Given delta greater than 0δ > 0, every polynomial q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈R[x] satisfying q left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals deltaq(u) ⩾δ for all u element of upper Su ∈S
admits a representation 
q equals sigma 0 plus sigma 1 p 1 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus sigma Subscript r Baseline p Subscript rq = σ0 + σ1p1 + · · · + σrpr
where sigma 0 comma ellipsis comma sigma Subscript r Baseline element of upper Sigmaσ0, . . . , σr ∈ fulﬁll 
degree left parenthesis sigma Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis less than or slanted equals upper D left parenthesis p comma degree left parenthesis q right parenthesis comma parallel to q parallel to comma delta right parenthesisdeg(σi) ⩽D(p, deg(q), ∥q∥, δ)
for i equals 0 comma ellipsis comma ri = 0, . . . , r. Any norm double vertical bar dot double vertical bar∥· ∥can be chosen here, but the function D will 
depend on that choice. 
The following exercise contains the crucial idea from [52]. 
Exercise A.24 
Let upper C 1 subset of or equal to upper C 2 subset of or equal to midline horizontal ellipsisC1 ⊆C2 ⊆· · · be an increasing chain of convex sets in the real vectorspace 
V , and set upper C equals union Underscript d greater than or slanted equals 1 Endscripts upper C Subscript dC = 	
d⩾1 Cd. Let  W be a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of V , and let 
upper K subset of or equal to i n t left parenthesis upper C intersection upper W right parenthesisK ⊆int (C ∩W) be a compact set (all with respect to the Euclidean topology on 
W). Show that there exists some d greater than or slanted equals 1d ⩾1 with upper K subset of or equal to upper C Subscript d Baseline periodK ⊆Cd.
Exercise A.25 
Give a proof of Theorem A.23, using Theorem A.13 and Exercise A.24. 
The above arguments just provide the existence of degree bounds. However, note 
that Nie and Schweighofer have also determined the complexity of the function D 
in [74]. 
This result by itself does not help us much: To prove exactness of the Lasserre-
Parrilo relaxation, we would need to show that the degree bound can be chosen 
independently of deltaδ and parallel to q parallel to comma∥q∥, at least if q has degree 1. The insight of Helton and Nie 
(as explained in Sect. 3.5) was that this could be proved under suitable regularity 
assumptions with the use of Lagrange functions. Their approach requires a version 
of Putinar’s Theorem for (non-linear) matrix polynomials with degree bounds. We 
will prove this result in Sect. A.3 below.

But ﬁrst we will need a version of Putinar’s Theorem for afﬁne varieties. We 
brieﬂy recall the correspondence between afﬁne double struck upper RR-varieties, (real) radical ideals, 
and afﬁne double struck upper RR-algebras. For any ideal I in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x], the set  
upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper C Superscript nV = VC(I) ⊆Cn
of common complex zeros of elements in I is the afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety deﬁned by I. We  
denote by upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisV (R) = VR(I) its real points. Conversely, for any subset upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper C Superscript nS ⊆Cn, we  
write script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisI(S) for the vanishing ideal of S in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz (see for 
example [25]) says that 
script upper I left parenthesis script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis right parenthesis equals StartRoot upper I EndRoot equals left brace p element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket vertical bar there exists k greater than or slanted equals 0 colon p Superscript k Baseline element of upper I right braceI(VC(I)) =
√
I = {p ∈R[x] | ∃k ⩾0: pk ∈I}
is the radical of the ideal I. The  real coordinate ring/algebra of the afﬁne variety 
upper V equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisV = VC(I) is the residue class algebra 
double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket colon equals double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket divided by StartRoot upper I EndRoot periodR[V ] := R[x]/

I.
It consists of all real polynomial mappings on V , also called (real) regular functions. 
The real analogue of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz is the real Nullstellensatz, which 
says that 
script upper I left parenthesis script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis right parenthesis equals RootIndex re StartRoot upper I EndRootI(VR(I)) =

re√
I := {p ∈R[x] | ∃k ⩾0, σ ∈ : p2k + σ ∈I}.
It is easy to see that a vanishing ideal script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisI(S) for upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn is a real radical ideal , i.e. 
RootIndex re StartRoot script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis EndRoot equals script upper I left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis period re
I(S) = I(S).
A standard result in real algebraic geometry says that the radical ideal StartRoot upper I EndRoot
√
I is real 
radical if and only if upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) is double struck upper RR-Zariski dense in V . 
The algebra double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ] is a reduced, ﬁnitely generated double struck upper RR-algebra. Conversely, given 
any such algebra script upper AA, ﬁx ﬁnitely many generators y 1 comma ellipsis comma y Subscript n Baseliney1, . . . , yn of script upper AA and consider the 
surjective ring homomorphism

Since script upper AA is reduced, upper I equals kernel left parenthesis phi right parenthesisI = ker(ϕ) is a radical ideal in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x], and script upper AA is thus isomorphic 
to the coordinate ring of the afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisVC(I). Furthermore, this can be made 
independent of the choice of generators y 1 comma ellipsis comma y Subscript n Baseline commay1, . . . , yn, by indentifying points in script upper V Subscript double struck upper C Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisVC(I)

with double struck upper RR-algebra homomorphisms script upper A right arrow double struck upper CA →C. In this way, the set upper H o m Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis script upper A comma double struck upper C right parenthesisHomR(A, C) can be 
regarded as the abstract variety V corresponding to script upper AA, with real points upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis equals upper H o m Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis script upper A comma double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) =
HomR(A, R). 
Given an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety V and elements p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketp1, . . . , pr ∈R[V ], we have a  
corresponding semialgebraic subset 
script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis colon equals left brace u element of upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis vertical bar p 1 left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 right brace periodSV (p) = SV (p1, . . . , pr) := {u ∈V (R) | p1(u) ⩾0, . . . , pr(u) ⩾0}.
Just as in the polynomial ring, we call a quadratic module upper Q subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketQ ⊆R[V ] Archimedean, 
if it contains an element g such that script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesisSV (g) is bounded. We need the following 
generalization of Putinar’s Theorem to this setup. 
Corollary A.26 (Putinar’s Positivstellensatz for Afﬁne Varieties) 
Let V be an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety with coordinate ring double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket commaR[V ], and assume upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketQ =
QM(p) ⊆R[V ] is a ﬁnitely generated Archimedean quadratic module. Then 
Q contains all elements q element of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketq ∈R[V ] such that q left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0q(u) > 0 for all u element of script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisu ∈SV (p). 
Proof We can ﬁx an embedding of V into afﬁne space and just interpret Putinar’s 
Theorem A.13 modulo the vanishing ideal: Let y 1 comma ellipsis comma y Subscript n Baseliney1, . . . , yn be generators of double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ], 
and let upper I subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketI ⊆R[x] be the kernel of the surjective homomorphism 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column phi colon double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket 2nd Column right arrow script upper A 2nd Row 1st Column q u a d x Subscript i 2nd Column right arrow from bar y Subscript i Baseline comma EndLayoutϕ : R[x] →A

so that upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) is identiﬁed with the algebraic subset script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesisVR(I) of double struck upper R Superscript nRn. Let q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq1, . . . , qr ∈
R[x] be such that phi left parenthesis q Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals p Subscript iϕ(qi) = pi in double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket commaR[V ], and let h 1 comma ellipsis comma h Subscript s Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketh1, . . . , hs ∈R[x] be generators of 
the ideal I. Consider 
upper Q 0 colon equals phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis equals upper Q plus upper I periodQ0 := ϕ−1(Q) = Q + I.
Then 
upper Q 0 equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis q 1 comma ellipsis comma q Subscript r Baseline comma h 1 comma ellipsis comma h Subscript s Baseline comma minus h 1 comma ellipsis comma minus h Subscript s Baseline right parenthesisQ0 = QM(q1, . . . , qr, h1, . . . , hs, −h1, . . . , −hs)
is also a ﬁnitely generated quadratic module. This follows from the observation that 
any element from double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] is a difference of two sums of squares, see Exercise 3.27 (or 
even a difference of two squares if the degree does not matter). 
We next show that upper Q 0Q0 is Archimedean. Since Q is Archimedean, there is some 
g element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketg ∈R[x] such that phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis element of upper Qϕ(g) ∈Q and script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisSV (ϕ(g)) ⊆V (R) is bounded. By Schmüdgen’s 
Theorem A.11, the preordering 
upper P colon equals upper P upper O left parenthesis g comma h 1 comma ellipsis comma h Subscript s Baseline comma minus h 1 comma ellipsis comma minus h Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketP := PO(g, h1, . . . , hs, −h1, . . . , −hs) ⊆R[x]

script upper S left parenthesis g comma h 1 comma ellipsis comma h Subscript s Baseline comma minus h 1 comma ellipsis comma minus h Subscript s Baseline right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis g right parenthesis intersection script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis upper I right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline periodS(g, h1, . . . , hs, −h1, . . . , −hs) = S(g) ∩VR(I) ⊆Rn.
Hence there is some g prime element of upper Pg′ ∈P such that script upper S left parenthesis g prime right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS(g′) ⊆Rn is bounded. On the other hand, 
we have upper P upper O left parenthesis phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis right parenthesis equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Q commaPO(ϕ(g)) = QM(ϕ(g)) ⊆Q, and thus 
upper P equals phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper P upper O left parenthesis phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to phi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis equals upper Q 0 commaP = ϕ−1(PO(ϕ(g))) ⊆ϕ−1(Q) = Q0,
which shows that upper Q 0Q0 is indeed Archimedean. 
Finally, if q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈R[x] satisﬁes phi left parenthesis q right parenthesis left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0ϕ(q)(u) > 0 for all u element of script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesisu ∈SV (Q), this implies 
q left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0q(u) > 0 for all u element of script upper S left parenthesis upper Q 0 right parenthesisu ∈S(Q0), and therefore q element of upper Q 0q ∈Q0, by Putinar’s Theorem A.13. 
Hence phi left parenthesis q right parenthesis element of phi left parenthesis upper Q 0 right parenthesis equals upper Qϕ(q) ∈ϕ(Q0) = Q.
⊓⊔
▶Remark A.27 In the last theorem, it is not necessary for the algebra to be 
reduced, i.e., to be the coordinate algebra of V . The statement remains true if 
it is ﬁnitely generated and V is the associated afﬁne variety.

Positive Matrix Polynomials 
In this section, we explain Putinar’s Positivstellensatz for matrix polynomials, with 
and without degree bounds. It is a crucial ingredient in the proofs of the results of 
Helton and Nie in Sect. 3.5. 
By a sum of squares in the non-commutative ring upper M a t Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketMats R[x], we mean a matrix 
polynomial of the form upper Q Superscript upper T Baseline upper Q commaQT Q, where upper Q element of upper M a t Subscript r times s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketQ ∈Matr×s R[x] is a matrix polynomial, for 
some r greater than or slanted equals 1r ⩾1. Clearly, if a matrix polynomial is a sum of squares, it is symmetric 
and positive semideﬁnite in every point of double struck upper R Superscript nRn. We start with some exercises to 
familiarize ourselves with the notion. 
Exercise A.28 
Show that upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF ∈Syms R[x] is a sum of squares if and only if there exist matrices

is a sum of squares in the polynomial ring double struck upper R left bracket x comma y right bracketR[x, y].

Exercise A.30 
Show that if upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF ∈Syms R[x] is a sum of squares, then det left parenthesis upper F right parenthesisdet(F) (and hence all 
principal minors of F) are sums of squares in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. What about the converse? 
Exercise A.31 
Show that every globally positive semideﬁnite matrix polynomial in one variable is 
a sum of squares. Hint: If you get stuck, take a look at [18], Theorem 7.1. 
To prove Putinar’s Theorem for matrix polynomials, we use an idea of Klep 
and Schweighofer, as presented in [49] and [45]. Let upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF
∈Syms R[x] be a 
matrix polynomial and let script upper A Subscript upper FAF be the commutative double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]-subalgebra of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketSyms R[x]
generated by F. Explicitly, script upper A Subscript upper FAF consists of all expressions of the form p left parenthesis x comma upper F right parenthesis commap(x, F),
where p element of double struck upper R left bracket x comma t right bracketp ∈R[x, t] is a polynomial in x and one additional variable t. 
Lemma A.32 
Let upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF ∈Syms R[x] be a matrix polynomial, and consider the map 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column phi colon double struck upper R left bracket x comma t right bracket 2nd Column right arrow script upper A Subscript upper F Baseline 2nd Row 1st Column q u a d p left parenthesis x comma t right parenthesis 2nd Column right arrow from bar p left parenthesis x comma upper F right parenthesis period EndLayoutϕ : R[x, t] →AF
p(x, t) →p(x, F).
Then the following holds: 
1. The minimal polynomial mu Subscript upper FμF of F in the polynomial ring double struck upper R left parenthesis x right parenthesis left bracket t right bracketR(x)[t] in one 
variable is contained in double struck upper R left bracket x comma t right bracket commaR[x, t], and it generates the ideal kernel left parenthesis phi right parenthesisker(ϕ). 
2. The real points script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis kernel phi right parenthesisVR(ker ϕ) of the variety corresponding to script upper A Subscript upper FAF form the 
hypersurface consisting of all points left parenthesis u comma lamda right parenthesis element of double struck upper R Superscript n times double struck upper R(u, λ) ∈Rn × R such that lamdaλ is an 
eigenvalue of upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesisF(u). 
Proof 
(1) Recall that mu Subscript upper FμF is the unique monic polynomial in double struck upper R left parenthesis x right parenthesis left bracket t right bracketR(x)[t] of minimal degree in 
t such that mu Subscript upper F Baseline left parenthesis upper F right parenthesis equals 0μF (F) = 0. By the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, it is a factor of the 
characteristic polynomial

denominators of the (maximally reduced) coefﬁcients of mu Subscript upper FμF with respect to 
t, so that c mu Subscript upper F element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket left bracket t right bracketcμF ∈R[x][t] is primitive. By Gauss’s Lemma (in the form of 
Lemma A.33 below), we have 
StartFraction 1 Over c EndFraction dot r element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket left bracket t right bracket period1
c · r ∈R[x][t].
Since r is monic, this implies StartFraction 1 Over c EndFraction element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket 1
c ∈R[x], hence c element of double struck upper R Superscript timesc ∈R× and mu Subscript upper F Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket left bracket t right bracketμF ∈R[x][t]. It  
now follows from Lemma A.33 that mu Subscript upper FμF divides any element of kernel left parenthesis phi right parenthesisker(ϕ) in double struck upper R left bracket x comma t right bracketR[x, t]
and is therefore a generator. (2) follows from (1), since script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis mu Subscript upper F Baseline right parenthesis equals script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis chi Subscript upper F Baseline right parenthesisVR(μF ) = VR(χF ). 
⊓⊔
Lemma A.33 
Let R be a unique factorization domain with ﬁeld of fractions K, and let 
p comma q element of upper R left bracket t right bracketp, q ∈R[t] be polynomials with q primitive. If p equals q rp = qr for some r element of upper K left bracket t right bracketr ∈K[t], 
then r element of upper R left bracket t right bracketr ∈R[t]. 
Proof This is a direct consequence of Gauss’s Lemma (see [55], Corollary IV.2.2). 
⊓⊔
We will now state and prove Putinar’s Positivstellensatz for matrix polynomials. 
Although the statement looks like a non-commutative result, we can in fact reduce 
everything to a commutative algebra, mainly because only one matrix polynomial is 
involved. 
Theorem A.34 (Putinar’s Positivistellensatz for Matrix Polynomials) 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be an Archimedean description of the set upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p). 
Then every matrix polynomial upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket commaF ∈Syms R[x], such that upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesisF(u) is positive 
deﬁnite for all u element of upper Su ∈S, admits a representation 
upper F equals upper S 0 plus p 1 upper S 1 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus p Subscript r Baseline upper S Subscript rF = S0 + p1S1 + · · · + prSr
where upper S 0 comma ellipsis comma upper S Subscript r BaselineS0, . . . , Sr are sums of squares in the algebra script upper A Subscript upper F Baseline subset of or equal to upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketAF ⊆Syms R[x]. 
Proof Let phi colon double struck upper R left bracket x comma t right bracket right arrow script upper A Subscript upper F Baselineϕ : R[x, t] →AF be as above, with corresponding double struck upper RR-variety upper V equals script upper V left parenthesis kernel phi right parenthesisV =
V(ker ϕ). To apply Putinar’s Positivstellensatz for afﬁne algebras, we ﬁrst need to 
check that the quadratic module generated by p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr in script upper A Subscript upper FAF is Archimedean. 
By assumption, upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM(p) is Archimedean, so it contains some g element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketg ∈R[x] such that

script upper S left parenthesis g right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS(g) ⊆Rn is bounded. Now 
script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis phi left parenthesis g right parenthesis right parenthesis equals left brace left parenthesis u comma lamda right parenthesis element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline times double struck upper R vertical bar g left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 comma lamda an eigenvalue of upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesis right brace subset of or equal to upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisSV (ϕ(g)) =




is also bounded, because the spectral radius of upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesisF(u) (largest absolute value of 
an eigenvalue) is bounded on the bounded set script upper S left parenthesis g right parenthesisS(g). Thus upper Q upper M Subscript script upper A Sub Subscript upper F Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQMAF (p) is also 
Archimedean (see [45], Satz 5.2.1, for a more careful version of this argument). 
Now upper F element of script upper A Subscript upper FF ∈AF , regarded as a function on script upper V Subscript double struck upper R Baseline left parenthesis kernel left parenthesis phi right parenthesis right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript n plus 1VR(ker(ϕ)) ⊆Rn+1, is just the  
polynomial t, i.e., it is the function 
upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis contains as member left parenthesis u comma lamda right parenthesis right arrow from bar lamda periodV (R) ∋(u, λ) →λ.
Since lamdaλ is an eigenvalue of upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesisF(u) by Lemma A.32 (2), and since F is positive deﬁnite 
on S, this is a strictly positive function on script upper S Subscript upper V Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis commaSV (p), and we can apply Putinar’s 
Positivstellensatz in the form of Corollary A.26 to conclude that F is contained 
in the quadratic module generated by p in script upper A Subscript upper FAF . 
⊓⊔
We ﬁnally obtain the existence of degree bounds for the matrix polynomial version 
of Putinar’s Theorem just as for Theorem A.23 above, using Kriel’s idea from 
Exercise A.24. This result was ﬁrst proven in [42], in a less elementary way. There 
are some more approaches to the result, which even contain some information about 
the degree-bounding function D. The theses [49] and [45] give very good accounts 
of these results. 
Here, the degree of a matrix polynomial is deﬁned as the maximum degree of 
its entries (which is the same as the usual degree, when considered as a polynomial 
with matrix coefﬁcients). 
Theorem A.35 (Putinar’s Theorem for Matrix Polynomials with Degree 
Bounds) 
Let p equals left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisp = (p1, . . . , pr) be an Archimedean description of the set upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p right parenthesisS = S(p). 
Given delta greater than 0δ > 0, every matrix polynomial upper F element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketF ∈Syms R[x] satisfying upper F left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals delta upper I Subscript sF(u) ⩾δIs
for all u element of upper Su ∈S admits a representation 
upper F equals upper S 0 plus p 1 upper S 1 plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus p Subscript r Baseline upper S Subscript rF = S0 + p1S1 + · · · + prSr
where upper S 0 comma ellipsis comma upper S Subscript r Baseline element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketS0, . . . , Sr ∈Syms R[x] are sums of squares, with degrees bounded by 
degree left parenthesis upper S Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis less than or slanted equals upper D left parenthesis p comma s comma degree left parenthesis upper F right parenthesis comma parallel to upper F parallel to comma delta right parenthesisdeg(Si) ⩽D(p, s, deg(F), ∥F∥, δ)

depends on that choice.

Model-Theoretic Characterization of Stability 
In this section, we will describe some abstract tools that can be used to prove the 
existence of degree bounds for sums of squares and quadratic modules. We will 
assume some familiarity with the theory of real closed ﬁelds, in particular the Tarski 
Transfer Principle, which says that a ﬁrst-order sentence in the language of ordered 
rings holds in one real closed ﬁeld, say double struck upper RR, if and only if it holds in every real closed 
ﬁeld (see for example [10, 63, 83] and also [84]). In fact, we are only interested 
in extension ﬁelds of double struck upper RR and the corresponding extensions of semialgebraic sets: 
If S is a semialgebraic subset of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline commaRn, and normal upper RR is any real closed extension ﬁeld of 
double struck upper RR, we write upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisS(R) for the base extension of S to normal upper RR, which is just the subset of normal upper R Superscript nRn
described by the same formula1 as S. Now an important consequence of the Transfer 
Principle is that upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisS(R) is non-empty if and only if S is non-empty. So unlike the 
complex numbers, or the algebraic ﬁeld extensions of double struck upper QQ studied in number theory, 
the purpose of real closed extension ﬁelds of double struck upper RR is not to add solutions to polynomial 
systems of equations and inequalities. The point is rather that solvability remains the 
same, even though the underlying ﬁeld may be radically different from double struck upper RR in other 
respects. To understand this, recall that in a ﬁrst-order formula we cannot quantify 
over the natural numbers or over subsets. This has two important consequences: 
(1) The Archimedean axiom 
left double quotation mark for all a element of double struck upper R there exists n element of double struck upper N colon StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue less than n right double quotation mark“∀a ∈R ∃n ∈N: |a| < n”
is not a ﬁrst order formula, and indeed the interesting real closed extension 
ﬁelds of double struck upper RR are non-Archimedean, in other words, they contain inﬁnitely large 
and inﬁnitesimal elements. 
(2) A statement of the form 
“There exists a polynomial such that. . . ”  
cannot be encoded in a ﬁrst-order formula. But instead, for ﬁxed d greater than or slanted equals 0 commad ⩾0, a 
statement of the form 
“There exists a polynomial of degree d such that. . . ”  
can be encoded, by quantifying its ﬁnitely many coefﬁcients. This provides the 
connection to the degree bounds in quadratic modules that we want to study. 
Now, in precise technical terms, here is the statement we will need.
1 A general semialgebraic set S in double struck upper R Superscript nRn is of the form upper S equals union Underscript i equals 1 Overscript k Endscripts left brace u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0 comma h Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0 for all j equals 1 comma ellipsis comma l right braceS = 	k
i=1{u ∈Rn | gij(u) > 0, hi(u) =
0 for all j = 1, . . . , l

for some ﬁnite family of polynomials g Subscript i j Baseline comma h Subscript i Baseline element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketgij, hi ∈R[x]. Then the base 
extension is simply the semialgebraic set upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis colon equals union Underscript i equals 1 Overscript k Endscripts left brace u element of normal upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis greater than 0 comma h Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0 for all j equals 1 comma ellipsis comma l right braceS(R) := 	k
i=1{u ∈Rn | gij(u) > 0, hij(u) =
0 for all j = 1, . . . , l

. Since normal upper RR is real closed, this is independent of the description, by Tarski’s 
Transfer Principle.

There exists a real closed extension ﬁeld double struck upper R Superscript asteriskR∗of double struck upper RR with the following property: 
Every countable cover of a semialgebraic subset of left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript asterisk Baseline right parenthesis Superscript n(R∗)n by semialgebraic

ultrapower double struck upper R Superscript asterisk Baseline equals double struck upper R Superscript double struck upper N Baseline divided by script upper FR∗= RN/F, where script upper FF is a non-principal ultraﬁlter on double struck upper NN, has 
this property. 
Proof See [83], Theorem 2.2.11. 
⊓⊔
The ultrapower double struck upper R Superscript asteriskR∗can be written down more or less explicitly, assuming that a 
non-principal ultraﬁlter script upper FF on double struck upper NN is given (but it lies in the nature of non-principal 
ultraﬁlters that they exist only by virtue of the axiom of choice, so one cannot 
actually write one down). To relieve the somewhat ethereal nature of the argument, 
and to help understand what is going on here, we look at a more concrete example. 
Example A.37 
Let upper S Subscript i Baseline equals left bracket negative i comma i right bracket subset of or equal to double struck upper RSi = [−i, i] ⊆R and consider the ascending chain of closed intervals upper S 1 subset of or equal to upper S 2 subset of or equal to midline horizontal ellipsisS1 ⊆S2 ⊆· · · in 
double struck upper RR. Of course, this chain is not stationary, yet 
union Underscript i element of double struck upper N Endscripts upper S Subscript i Baseline equals double struck upper R

i∈N
Si = R
is semialgebraic. So double struck upper RR itself is clearly not normal first transfinite cardinal 1ℵ1-saturated. However, it is not hard to show that 
the rational function ﬁeld double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper Q u o t left parenthesis double struck upper R left bracket t right bracket right parenthesisR(t) = Quot(R[t]) has a unique ordering in which t is inﬁnitely 
large, i.e., larger than any constant from double struck upper RR. Using this ordering, we consider 
union Underscript i element of double struck upper N Endscripts upper S Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis equals left brace f element of double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesis vertical bar there exists i element of double struck upper N colon plus or minus f less than i right brace comma

which is also called the order-convex hull of double struck upper ZZ in double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesisR(t). This is not a semialgebraic subset of 
double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesisR(t), by Exercise A.38. The non-Archimedean ﬁeld double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesisR(t) is tiny compared to the ultrapower 
double struck upper R Superscript asteriskR∗, but this example captures the nature of the compactness of double struck upper R Superscript asteriskR∗in the above theorem. 
Exercise A.38 
Prove that the order-convex hull of double struck upper ZZ in double struck upper R left parenthesis t right parenthesisR(t) is not semialgebraic. 
We now present an application to our problem of stability of quadratic modules. 
Given a ﬁnitely generated quadratic module upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQ = QM(p) in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket commaR[x], and a real closed 
extension ﬁeld normal upper RR of double struck upper RR, consider the quadratic module upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQMR(p) generated by p in 
normal upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x]. It turns out that Q is stable if and only if upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQMR(p) is the base extension of Q 
to normal upper RR (suitably deﬁned), for all normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R. The result is taken from [95].

Proposition A.39 
For a ﬁnitely generated quadratic module upper Q equals upper Q upper M left parenthesis p right parenthesisQ = QM(p) in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x], the following 
are equivalent: 
1. Q is stable. 
2. For all real closed extension ﬁelds normal upper RR of double struck upper R commaR, and for all d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0, the  set  
upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection normal upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dQMR(p) ∩R[x]d
is semialgebraic over double struck upper RR. 
3. The cone upper Q Subscript d Baseline colon equals upper Q intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dQd := Q ∩R[x]d is semialgebraic for all d greater than or slanted equals 0d ⩾0, and for all real 
closed extension ﬁelds normal upper RR of double struck upper RR, upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection normal upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dQMR(p) ∩R[x]d coincides with the base 
extension upper Q Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisQd(R) of upper Q Subscript dQd to normal upper RR. 
Proof (1)right double arrow⇒(3): If Q is stable, we have upper Q Subscript d Baseline equals upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dQd = QM[e](p) ∩R[x]d for some e element of double struck upper Ne ∈N. 
So we can deﬁne upper Q Subscript dQd by an explicit ﬁrst order formula, saying 
“There exists a quadratic module representation with degrees bounded by e.” 
In particular, upper Q Subscript dQd is semialgebraic. In addition, for each k element of double struck upper N commak ∈N, there is a valid 
statement over double struck upper R commaR, saying 
“Whenever a polynomial of degree d has a representation in upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket k right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[k](p), 
then it has one in upper Q upper M Subscript left bracket e right bracket Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisQM[e](p).” 
By Tarski’s Transfer Principle, these statements thus also hold over normal upper R commaR, and we 
immediately obtain the desired statement 
upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection normal upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript d Baseline equals upper Q Subscript d Baseline left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis periodQMR(p) ∩R[x]d = Qd(R).
(3)right double arrow⇒(2) is clear. For (2)right double arrow⇒(1), let normal upper R equals double struck upper R Superscript asteriskR = R∗be a saturated real closed extension ﬁeld 
as in Theorem A.36. Now upper Q upper M Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis intersection normal upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript dQMR(p)∩R[x]d is semialgebraic over double struck upper RR by assumption, 
and it is clearly covered by the ascending chain of semialgebraic sets deﬁned by the 
formulas saying 
“There exists a quadratic module representation with degrees bounded by k”. 
So by Theorem A.36 one ﬁxed such k sufﬁces, and the same is then true over double struck upper R commaR, by 
Tarski’s Transfer Principle. This is stability of Q.

Sums of Squares on Compact Curves and Base Extension 
The goal of this section is to sketch the proof of Theorem 3.30, which says that 
the saturated preordering of a compact subset of a smooth curve over double struck upper RR remains 
saturated when going up to a real closed extension ﬁeld. Using the results from the 
previous section, this even implies stability of these ﬁnitely generated preorderings.

Example A.40 
Consider the situation on the real line, where everything is completely elementary. For the 
unit interval upper S equals left bracket negative 1 comma 1 right bracketS = [−1, 1], the saturated preordering upper P equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP = P(S) in double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] is generated by the 
polynomial 1 minus x squared1 −x2. This is not hard to show directly. If normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R is a real closed ﬁeld extension, 
the preordering upper P upper O Subscript normal upper R Baseline left parenthesis 1 minus x squared right parenthesisPOR(1 −x2) in normal upper R left bracket x right bracketR[x] is still saturated. But that is because we can just do the 
same direct proof over normal upper RR, not because of what we know over double struck upper RR. 
If Z is an afﬁne curve over double struck upper RR, the situation is far more complicated. One of the 
main results in [94] says, that if Z is smooth and upper P equals upper P upper O left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisP = PO(p1, . . . , pr) is a ﬁnitely 
generated preordering in double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z] deﬁning a bounded set upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisS = S(p1, . . . , pr) ⊆Z(R), 
then P is saturated if and only if in each boundary point u of S in upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisZ(R) one of the 
generators p Subscript ipi vanishes to order 1 (or two generators with opposing sign changes if u 
is an isolated point, see [94], Theorem 5.17). We can see this in the above example 
too: The polynomial 1 minus x squared1 −x2 has simple roots 1 and negative 1−1, whereas left parenthesis 1 minus x squared right parenthesis cubed(1 −x2)3 has triple 
roots and therefore does not generate script upper P left parenthesis left bracket negative 1 comma 1 right bracket right parenthesisP([−1, 1]), as we showed in Example A.18. 
However, the same statement does not hold for curves over a non-Archimedean real 
closed ﬁeld normal upper RR. The proof of Theorem 3.30 requires completely new techniques. But 
it turns out that ﬁnding certain elements in upper P Subscript normal upper RPR with simple zeros on the boundary of 
S still plays a role in the proof. 
Let A be a commutative ring with one half element of upper A comma 1
2 ∈A, and let P be a preordering of A. In this  
generality, P is called Archimedean if for every a element of upper Aa ∈A there exists n element of double struck upper Zn ∈Z such that 
n plus or minus a element of upper Pn ± a ∈P. It is a consequence of Schmüdgen’s Theorem that this deﬁnition agrees 
with the one given earlier for preorderings in the polynomial ring. If German pp is a prime 
ideal in A, we let upper P Subscript German pPp denote the preordering generated by P in the localisation upper A Subscript German pAp. 
Explicitly, we have 
upper P Subscript German p Baseline equals left brace StartFraction a Over b squared EndFraction vertical bar a element of upper P comma b element of upper A minus German p right brace periodPp =

We will use the following local-global principle, developed in [96]. 
Theorem A.41 (Archimedean Local-Global Principle) 
Let A be a ring containing one half comma1
2, and let P be an Archimedean preordering of A. 
Then an element a element of upper Aa ∈A is contained in P if and only if it is contained in upper P Subscript German mPm
for every maximal ideal German mm of A. 
Proof See [96], Theorem 2.8, or [63], Theorem 9.6.2.

Real Algebraic Geometry
To study the local preorderings upper P Subscript German mPm, we will need to work in the real spectrum. We 
quickly recall the basics and ﬁx notations: The points of the real spectrum upper S p e r upper ASper A
of A are the pairs 
left parenthesis German p comma less than or slanted equals right parenthesis(p, ⩽)
where German pp is a prime ideal of upper A commaA, and less than or slanted equals⩽is an ordering of the residue ﬁeld upper Q u o t left parenthesis upper A divided by German p right parenthesisQuot(A/p). If  
alpha equals left parenthesis German p comma less than or slanted equals right parenthesisα = (p, ⩽) is a point in upper S p e r upper ASper A, the prime ideal German pp is called the support of alphaα, denoted 
s u p p left parenthesis alpha right parenthesissupp(α). An element a element of upper Aa ∈A is regarded as a function on upper S p e r upper ASper A, and 
a left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 or a left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis greater than 0a(α) ⩾0 or a(α) > 0
means that the class of a in 
upper Q u o t left parenthesis upper A divided by s u p p left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis right parenthesisQuot(A/ supp(α))
is non-negative (strictly positive) with respect to the ordering given by alphaα. 
If upper A Subscript German pAp is the localization of A in a prime ideal German pp, the prime ideals of upper A Subscript German pAp are in 
canonical bijection with the prime ideals of A contained in German pp. Accordingly, the real 
spectrum upper S p e r upper A Subscript German pSper Ap can be considered as an open subset of upper S p e r upper ASper A, consisting of those 
points alpha element of upper S p e r upper Aα ∈Sper A with s u p p left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis subset of or equal to German psupp(α) ⊆p. Given a preordering P of A, we write 
upper X Subscript upper P Baseline colon equals StartSet alpha element of upper S p e r upper A vertical bar a left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 for all a element of upper P EndSetXP :=

for the subset of upper S p e r upper ASper A deﬁned by P. 
If V is an afﬁne double struck upper RR-variety, the real points upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisV (R) can be identiﬁed with a subset 
of upper S p e r double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketSper R[V ]. Namely, each point v element of upper V left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisv ∈V (R) corresponds to a maximal ideal German m Subscript vmv in 
double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket commaR[V ], and the residue ﬁeld 
double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket divided by German m Subscript v Baseline approximately equals double struck upper RR[V ]/mv ∼= R
has a unique order, so that there is a unique point alpha Subscript v Baseline element of upper S p e r double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketαv ∈Sper R[V ] with s u p p left parenthesis alpha Subscript v Baseline right parenthesis equals German m Subscript vsupp(αv) =
mv. If  P is a ﬁnitely generated preordering in double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ], then clearly script upper S left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper X Subscript upper PS(P) ⊆XP under 
this identiﬁcation. 
The following proposition will be very important to reduce the number of 
maximal ideals we need to consider, when applying the Archimedean local global 
principle. 
Proposition A.42 
Let A be a local ring with one half element of upper A comma 1
2 ∈A, and let P be a preordering in A. Then every 
a element of upper Aa ∈A with a greater than 0a > 0 on upper X Subscript upper P Baseline subset of or equal to upper S p e r upper AXP ⊆Sper A is contained in P.

Let normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R be a real closed ﬁeld extension. Again we denote by script upper OO the convex hull 
of double struck upper ZZ in normal upper RR. It is a subring of upper R commaR, which clearly has the property that a element of script upper Oa ∈O or a Superscript negative 1 Baseline element of script upper Oa−1 ∈O
holds for every a element of normal upper R minus StartSet 0 EndSeta ∈R \ {0}. It is therefore a valuation ring, i.e., there is a valuation 
nu colon normal upper R right arrow upper Gamma union StartSet normal infinity EndSetν : R → ∪{∞}
into some ordered group upper Gamma comma, such that 
script upper O equals StartSet a element of normal upper R vertical bar nu left parenthesis a right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 EndSetO = {a ∈R | ν(a) ⩾0}
is the valuation ring of nuν. The residue ﬁeld of script upper OO modulo its maximal ideal 
German m equals StartSet a element of script upper O vertical bar nu left parenthesis a right parenthesis greater than 0 EndSetm = {a ∈O | ν(a) > 0}
is just double struck upper R commaR, and we denote the residue class map script upper O right arrow script upper O divided by German m approximately equals double struck upper RO →O/m ∼= R by a right arrow from bar ModifyingAbove a With quotation dasha →a. 
Now let V be an irreducible afﬁne variety over double struck upper RR with coordinate ring double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket commaR[V ], and 
consider the base extension of V to normal upper RR with coordinate ring normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket equals double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline normal upper RR[V ] = R[V ]⊗R R. The  
valuation nuν extends to a map omega colon normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket right arrow upper Gamma union StartSet normal infinity EndSetω: R[V ] → ∪{∞} as follows: Given an element 
p equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript r Endscripts p Subscript i Baseline circled times a Subscript i Baseline element of normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket equals double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline normal upper Rp =

omega left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals min left brace nu left parenthesis a Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis vertical bar i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma r right brace periodω(p) = min{ν(ai) | i = 1, . . . , r}.
One can check that omegaω has the same formal properties as nuν, i.e., 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column omega left parenthesis p plus q right parenthesis 2nd Column greater than or slanted equals min left brace omega left parenthesis p right parenthesis comma omega left parenthesis q right parenthesis right brace and 2nd Row 1st Column omega left parenthesis p q right parenthesis 2nd Column equals omega left parenthesis p right parenthesis plus omega left parenthesis q right parenthesis EndLayoutω(p + q) ⩾min{ω(p), ω(q)} and
ω(pq) = ω(p) + ω(q)
for all p comma q element of normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracketp, q ∈R[V ]. The ﬁrst is clear from the deﬁnition. The second is not difﬁcult 
to show, but uses the fact that double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracketR[V ] is integral. 
We will mostly work in the coordinate ring of V with coefﬁcients in the valuation 
ring, which is the ring 
script upper O left bracket upper V right bracket equals double struck upper R left bracket upper V right bracket circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline script upper O equals StartSet p element of normal upper R left bracket upper V right bracket vertical bar omega left parenthesis f right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 EndSet periodO[V ] = R[V ] ⊗R O = {p ∈R[V ] | ω(f ) ⩾0}.

Lemma A.43 
Let A be an double struck upper RR-algebra, and P an Archimedean preordering in A. Let normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R be 
a real closed extension, and script upper OO the convex hull of double struck upper ZZ in normal upper RR. Then the preordering 
upper P Subscript script upper OPO generated by P in upper A circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline script upper OA ⊗R O is again Archimedean. 
Proof Note ﬁrst that we have upper P minus upper P equals upper AP −P = A. For given a element of upper Aa ∈A, choose c element of double struck upper Rc ∈R with 
c plus or minus a element of upper Pc ± a ∈P, and observe 
a equals one half left parenthesis c plus a right parenthesis minus one half left parenthesis c minus a right parenthesis element of upper P minus upper P perioda = 1
2(c + a) −1
2(c −a) ∈P −P.
It follows that any p element of upper A circled times Subscript double struck upper R Baseline script upper Op ∈A ⊗R O can be written in the form p equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript r Endscripts p Subscript i Baseline circled times a Subscript ip = r
i=1 pi ⊗ai with 
p Subscript i Baseline element of upper Ppi ∈P and a Subscript i Baseline element of script upper Oai ∈O for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r. Now choose 0 less than c 1 element of double struck upper R0 < c1 ∈R with c 1 minus p Subscript i element of upper Pc1 −pi ∈P
for all i. Also, by deﬁnition of script upper OO, there exists c 2 element of double struck upper Rc2 ∈R with a Subscript i Baseline less than c 2ai < c2 for all i, hence 
c 2 minus a Subscript ic2 −ai is a square in script upper OO. Now we can write

We are now ready to present at least the main ideas in the proof of Theorem 3.30, 
which we restate. 
Theorem 
Let Z be a smooth afﬁne curve over double struck upper RR, let  upper S subset of or equal to upper Z left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesisS ⊆Z(R) be a compact 
semialgebraic subset, and let upper P equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketP = P(S) ⊆R[Z] be the saturated preordering 
of S. For any real closed ﬁeld extension normal upper R divided by double struck upper RR/R, the preordering upper P Subscript normal upper RPR generated 
by P in normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z] is again saturated. 
Proof Let p element of normal upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketp ∈R[Z] with p greater than or slanted equals 0p ⩾0 on upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis equals script upper S left parenthesis upper P Subscript normal upper R Baseline right parenthesisS(R) = S(PR). First, we can ﬁnd c element of normal upper Rc ∈R with 
omega left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals nu left parenthesis c squared right parenthesisω(p) = ν(c2), which implies omega left parenthesis c Superscript negative 2 Baseline p right parenthesis equals 0ω(c−2p) = 0 and c Superscript negative 2 Baseline p element of script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketc−2p ∈O[Z]. Since c Superscript negative 2 Baseline p element of upper P Subscript script upper Oc−2p ∈PO
clearly implies p element of upper P Subscript normal upper Rp ∈PR, we may assume p element of script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketp ∈O[Z] with omega left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals 0ω(p) = 0. We show  
p element of upper P Subscript script upper Op ∈PO in several steps. 
1. We wish to apply the Archimedean local global principle Theorem A.41 for 
upper P Subscript script upper O Baseline subset of or equal to script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketPO ⊆O[Z]. Since S is bounded, upper P equals script upper P left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisP = P(S) is Archimedean, and so upper P Subscript script upper OPO is 
Archimedean by Lemma A.43. So we only need to show that p is contained in 
left parenthesis upper P Subscript script upper O Baseline right parenthesis Subscript German m(PO)m for every maximal ideal German mm of script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketO[Z]. 
2. The next step is to show that since p is non-negative on upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis subset of or equal to upper Z left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesisS(R) ⊆Z(R), it is indeed 
non-negative on the corresponding subset upper X Subscript upper P Sub Subscript script upper OXPO of upper S p e r script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketSper O[Z]. We will omit the 
proof of this fact (see [98], Lemma 3.7). 
3. Now localizing in a maximal ideal German mm, we know that p is non-negative on the 
subset 
upper X Subscript upper P comma German m Baseline colon equals upper X Subscript upper P Sub Subscript script upper O intersection upper S p e r script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracket Subscript German mXP,m := XPO ∩Sper O[Z]m
of upper S p e r script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketSper O[Z]. If p greater than 0p > 0 on upper X Subscript upper P comma German mXP,m, then p element of upper P Subscript German mp ∈Pm by Proposition A.42. So we need 
only consider those maximal ideals German mm of script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketO[Z] that contain p and with upper X Subscript upper P comma German m Baseline not equals normal empty setXP,m ̸= ∅. 
We claim that such a maximal ideal German mm is necessarily of the form 
German m Subscript z Baseline equals StartSet sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts p Subscript i Baseline circled times a Subscript i Baseline vertical bar sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts ModifyingAbove a With quotation dash Subscript i Baseline p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis z right parenthesis equals 0 in double struck upper R EndSet commamz =

the maximal ideal of script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracketO[Z] corresponding to a point z element of upper Sz ∈S. To see this, let alpha element of upper X Subscript upper P comma German mα ∈

German p equals s u p p left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis intersection double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket commap = supp(α) ∩R[Z],
a prime ideal in double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z]. Since w left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals 0w(p) = 0, we cannot have s u p p left parenthesis alpha right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracket circled times German m commasupp(α) ⊆R[Z] ⊗m,
and so German p not equals left parenthesis 0 right parenthesisp ̸= (0). Since Z is a curve, this implies that German pp is a maximal ideal of double struck upper R left bracket upper Z right bracketR[Z]

and therefore corresponds to a point z element of upper Zz ∈Z. Since alpha element of upper X Subscript upper P comma German mα ∈XP,m, the point z must be

and script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracket divided by upper I equals script upper OO[Z]/I = O. So script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracket divided by German mO[Z]/m is a ﬁeld containing double struck upper RR and contained in script upper OO, hence 
it is Archimedean and thus coincides with double struck upper RR. Thus German mm corresponds to a real point, 
which must be the point z. 
4. Our goal is to ﬁnd an element q element of upper P Subscript script upper Oq ∈PO with the property that g equals p divided by qg = p/q is a unit 
in script upper O left bracket upper Z right bracket Subscript German m Baseline commaO[Z]m, and such that g is positive on upper X Subscript upper P comma German mXP,m. When that is done, we can apply 
Lemma A.42 and conclude g element of upper P Subscript German mg ∈Pm, hence p equals g q element of upper P Subscript German mp = gq ∈Pm, completing the proof. 
5. Showing the existence of q as in (4) is the most technical part of the proof and 
we will only give an outline. First, let script upper O Superscript c Baseline colon equals script upper O left bracket StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot right bracketOc := O[
√
−1] and consider the set of 
script upper O Superscript cOc-points 
upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesis equals StartSet zeta element of upper Z left parenthesis script upper O Superscript c Baseline right parenthesis vertical bar ModifyingAbove zeta With quotation dash equals z EndSetU(z) = {ζ ∈Z(Oc) | ζ = z}
that map to z under the residue map. We split the real zeros of p in upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesisU(z) into two 
groups 
StartSet zeta element of upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesis intersection upper Z left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis vertical bar p left parenthesis zeta right parenthesis equals 0 EndSet equals StartSet eta 1 comma ellipsis comma eta Subscript r Baseline EndSet union StartSet zeta 1 comma ellipsis comma zeta Subscript s Baseline EndSet{ζ ∈U(z) ∩Z(R) | p(ζ) = 0} = {η1, . . . , ηr} ∪{ζ1, . . . , ζs}
in such a way that eta 1 comma ellipsis comma eta Subscript r Baseline element of i n t left parenthesis upper S left parenthesis normal upper R right parenthesis right parenthesisη1, . . . , ηr

Furthermore, let StartSet omega 1 comma ellipsis comma omega Subscript t Baseline EndSet subset of or equal to upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesis{ω1, . . . , ωt} ⊆U(z) be a subset containing exactly one 
representative from each pair of non-real complex conjugate zeros of p in upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesisU(z). 
Next, one computes the order of vanishing of ModifyingAbove p With quotation dashp at z and ﬁnds (see [98], 
Proposition 3.15) 
o r d Subscript z Baseline left parenthesis ModifyingAbove p With quotation dash right parenthesis equals sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript r Endscripts o r d Subscript eta Sub Subscript j Subscript Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis plus sigma summation Underscript k equals 1 Overscript s Endscripts o r d Subscript zeta Sub Subscript k Subscript Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis plus 2 sigma summation Underscript l equals 1 Overscript t Endscripts o r d Subscript omega Sub Subscript l Subscript Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodordz(p) =

The crucial point is now to show that for every point zeta element of upper U left parenthesis z right parenthesisζ ∈U(z) with p left parenthesis zeta right parenthesis equals 0p(ζ) = 0, 
there exists an element q Subscript zeta Baseline element of upper P Subscript script upper Oqζ ∈PO with omega left parenthesis q Subscript zeta Baseline right parenthesis equals 0ω(qζ) = 0, q Subscript zeta Baseline left parenthesis zeta right parenthesis equals 0qζ(ζ) = 0 and

This

Convexity 
In this section we collect some important notions and results from convexity theory 
and optimization. As general references on convexity, we recommend the books 
[3,90,103], for optimization we refer to [5,13,65]. 
B.1
Convex Cones and Duality 
This section covers some basics from convexity theory, mostly about cones and 
duality. Throughout, let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional real vector space. By a cone in 
V , we will always mean a convex cone, i.e., a non-empty subset upper C subset of or equal to upper VC ⊆V such that 
u plus v element of upper Cu + v ∈C and alpha v element of upper Cαv ∈C hold for all u comma v element of upper Cu, v ∈C and alpha element of double struck upper Rα ∈R with alpha greater than or slanted equals 0α ⩾0. In particular, 
a cone always contains 0. A cone C is called pointed if upper C intersection left parenthesis negative upper C right parenthesis equals StartSet 0 EndSetC ∩(−C) = {0}. For  
example, upper S y m Subscript s Superscript plusSym+
s is a pointed cone in upper S y m Subscript sSyms, while any non-zero linear subspace of V 
is an example of a non-pointed cone. Given a subset S of V , we write 
c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis equals left brace sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript k Endscripts alpha Subscript i Baseline u Subscript i Baseline vertical bar u Subscript i Baseline element of upper S comma alpha Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0 comma k element of double struck upper N right bracecone(S) =

Convexity
Proposition B.1 
If the cone upper C subset of or equal to upper VC ⊆V is closed and pointed, then there exists an afﬁne hyperplane 
H of V with 0 not an element of upper H0 /∈H, upper C intersection upper HC ∩H compact, and 
upper C equals c o n e left parenthesis upper C intersection upper H right parenthesis periodC = cone(C ∩H).
Conversely, for any compact convex set upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn with 0 not an element of upper S0 /∈S, the cone c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesiscone(S)
is closed and pointed. 
Exercise B.2 
Prove Proposition B.1. 
In general, if upper C subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nC ⊆Rn is non-empty, closed and convex, there is a unique linear 
subspace upper V subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nV ⊆Rn, called the lineality space of C, with the property 
upper C equals left parenthesis upper C intersection upper V Superscript perpendicular Baseline right parenthesis plus upper VC = (C ∩V ⊥) + V
and such that upper C intersection upper V Superscript perpendicularC ∩V ⊥does not contain any afﬁne-linear subspace. The proof is 
contained in the following exercise. 
Exercise B.3 
Let upper C subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nC ⊆Rn be non-empty, closed and convex. Prove the following: 
1. If upper V subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nV ⊆Rn is a linear subspace with u plus upper V subset of or equal to upper Cu+V ⊆C for some u element of upper Cu ∈C, then u plus upper V subset of or equal to upper Cu+V ⊆C
for all u element of upper Cu ∈C. 
2. If V is a subspace with the property in (1), then upper C equals left parenthesis upper C intersection upper V Superscript perpendicular Baseline right parenthesis plus upper VC = (C ∩V ⊥) + V . 
3. There is a unique maximal subspace with the property in (1), called the lineality 
space of C. 
4. If V is the lineality space, then upper C intersection upper V Superscript perpendicularC ∩V ⊥does not contain any afﬁne-linear 
subspace. 
We will write

(B.1) 
A crucial tool in convexity theory is the Separation Theorem for convex sets, see for 
example [3] for a proof. 
Theorem B.4 (Separation Theorem) 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be a closed convex set. 
1. For any u element of upper V minus upper Su ∈V \ S there exists script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗and alpha element of double struck upper Rα ∈R with script l left parenthesis s right parenthesis greater than alphaℓ(s) > α for all 
s element of upper Ss ∈S and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis less than alpha periodℓ(u) < α.
2. For any u element of upper V minus r e l i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisu ∈V \ relint(S) there exists script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗and alpha element of double struck upper Rα ∈R with script l left parenthesis s right parenthesis greater than alphaℓ(s) > α for 
all s element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesiss ∈relint(S) and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals alpha periodℓ(u) = α.
For a subset upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V we denote by

the dual cone of S. Note that upper S Superscript or Baseline subset of or equal to upper S Superscript ringS∨⊆S◦, upper S Superscript ringS◦is a closed convex set containing 0, and 
upper S Superscript orS∨is a closed convex cone. If upper C subset of or equal to upper VC ⊆V is a cone, then 
upper C Superscript ring Baseline equals upper C Superscript or Baseline commaC◦= C∨,
since given script l element of upper C Superscript ringℓ∈C◦and c element of upper Cc ∈C, we must have  
alpha script l left parenthesis c right parenthesis equals script l left parenthesis alpha c right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals negative 1αℓ(c) = ℓ(αc) ⩾−1
for all alpha greater than or slanted equals 0α ⩾0, so script l left parenthesis c right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0ℓ(c) ⩾0. Note also that if upper U subset of or equal to upper VU ⊆V is a linear subspace, then 
upper U Superscript ring Baseline equals upper U Superscript or Baseline equals left brace script l element of upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline StartAbsoluteValue script l EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper U Baseline equals 0 right brace equals colon upper U Superscript perpendicular Baseline periodU◦= U∨= {ℓ∈V ∗| ℓ|U = 0

But the real connection between polar and dual only becomes clear when looking at 
homogenizations. If upper W subset of or equal to upper VW ⊆V is a hyperplane and v element of upper V minus upper Wv ∈V \ W, then for upper S subset of or equal to upper WS ⊆W we

From this point of view, polar and dual are basically the same. 
Note that V is canonically isomorphic to left parenthesis upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline right parenthesis Superscript asterisk(V ∗)∗, since V is ﬁnite-dimensional. 
Under this identiﬁcation, a fundamental fact is biduality and bipolarity, which can 
easily deduced from the Separation Theorem B.4 (1). 
Theorem B.5 (Bipolar/Biduality Theorem) 
For any subset S of V , we have 
left parenthesis upper S Superscript ring Baseline right parenthesis Superscript ring Baseline equals c l o s left parenthesis c o n v left parenthesis upper S union StartSet 0 EndSet right parenthesis right parenthesis and left parenthesis upper S Superscript or Baseline right parenthesis Superscript or Baseline equals c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesis period(S◦)◦= clos

In particular, if upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V is a closed convex subset containing 0, then left parenthesis upper S Superscript ring Baseline right parenthesis Superscript ring Baseline equals upper S(S◦)◦= S, 
and if upper C subset of or equal to upper VC ⊆V is a closed cone, then left parenthesis upper C Superscript or Baseline right parenthesis Superscript or Baseline equals upper C

If V is a ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean space with inner product left angle bracket dot comma dot right angle bracket⟨·, ·⟩, we can

Via this identiﬁcation, the polar/dual of a set upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V are

Lemma B.11 
Let C be a closed cone in V and U a linear subspace of V . 
1. If i n t left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis intersection upper U not equals normal empty setint(C) ∩U ̸= ∅, then upper C Superscript or Baseline intersection upper U Superscript perpendicular Baseline equals StartSet 0 EndSetC∨∩U⊥= {0}. 
2. If C is pointed and upper C intersection upper U equals StartSet 0 EndSetC ∩U = {0}, then upper C plus upper UC + U is closed. 
Proof Let pi colon upper V right arrow upper V divided by upper Uπ : V →V/U be the canonical projection. 
(1) If u element of i n t left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis intersection upper Uu ∈int(C) ∩U, then 0 equals pi left parenthesis u right parenthesis0 = π(u) is an interior point of pi left parenthesis upper C right parenthesisπ(C) in upper V divided by upper UV/U. Thus 
pi left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis equals upper V divided by upper Uπ(C) = V/U and upper C plus upper U equals pi Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis pi left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis right parenthesis equals upper VC + U = π−1(π(C)) = V . Thus

where we have used Lemma  B.8. 
(2) Since the cone C is closed and pointed, there is a compact convex subset S of

hypothesis that 
upper S intersection kernel left parenthesis pi right parenthesis equals normal empty set commaS ∩ker(π) = ∅,

so that pi left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisπ(S) is again compact and convex with 0 not an element of pi left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis0 /∈π(S). Hence pi left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis equals c o n e left parenthesis pi left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis right parenthesisπ(C) =

Faces and Dimension 
We now explain the notion of dimension for convex sets, as well the concept of 
faces. Both notions are often very helpful when examining convex sets. Again, let 
V be a ﬁnite-dimensional real vector space. 
Deﬁnition B.12 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be convex. We deﬁne the dimension dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisdim(S) of S as the dimension of 
the afﬁne hull a f f left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisaff(S) of S in V . 
Exercise B.13 
Prove that the convex set S has nonempty interior in a f f left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisaff(S). 
Deﬁnition B.14 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be closed and convex. 
1. A face of S is a convex subset upper F subset of or equal to upper S commaF ⊆S, with the property that alpha u plus left parenthesis 1 minus alpha right parenthesis v element of upper Fαu+(1−α)v ∈F
for u comma v element of upper Su, v ∈S and some alpha element of left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesisα ∈(0, 1) implies u comma v element of upper Fu, v ∈F. 
In words, if a line segment within S has interior points in F, then it is fully 
contained in F. 
2. An extreme point of S is a point u element of upper Su ∈S such that StartSet u EndSet{u} is a face of S. 
3. A face F is called proper if upper F not equals normal empty set comma upper SF ̸= ∅, S. It is called exposed if it is cut out by 
a supporting hyperplane, i.e., if there exists script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗and alpha element of double struck upper Rα ∈R with script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals alphaℓ|S ⩾α
and 
upper F equals StartSet u element of upper S vertical bar script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals alpha EndSet periodF = {u ∈S | ℓ(u) = α}.
Otherwise, F is called non-exposed.1 
Example B.15 
The faces of a polyhedron script upper S left parenthesis script l 1 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisS(ℓ1, . . . , ℓr) are exactly the vertices, edges, etc., deﬁned by the 
vanishing of a subset of script l 1 comma ellipsis comma script l Subscript r Baseline commaℓ1, . . . , ℓr, and they are all exposed.
1 Unfortunately, the terminology here is not uniform in the literature. It is equally common to call 
face what we call exposed face and use another term (e.g. facelet or extremal convex subset) for  
what we call face.

Exercise B.16 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be a closed convex set. 
1. Show that any intersection of faces of S is a face of S. 
2. Show that no proper face of S contains a point of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisrelint(S). 
3. Show that a convex subset F of S is a face if and only if upper S minus upper FS \ F is convex and any 
convex subset of S containing F has strictly greater dimension than F. 
Exercise B.17 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be a closed convex set. 
1. Show that for a proper face upper F subset of or not equals upper SF ⊊S we have dimension left parenthesis upper F right parenthesis less than dimension left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisdim(F) < dim(S). 
2. Show that any intersection of a family of faces of S is already obtained as a ﬁnite 
intersection of faces from the family. 
3. Show that any intersection of exposed faces of S is an exposed face of S. 
Proposition B.18 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be closed and convex, and let F be a face of S. Then the following 
holds: 
1. F is closed. 
2. Every face of F is also a face of S. 
3. If u element of r e l i n t left parenthesis upper F right parenthesisu ∈relint(F) and script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗with script l Subscript vertical bar Sub Subscript upper S Subscript Baseline greater than or slanted equals alphaℓ|S ⩾α and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals alphaℓ(u) = α, then script l vertical bar Subscript upper F Baseline identical to alphaℓ|F ≡α. 
4. Any point in the relative boundary of S is contained in a proper exposed 
face of S. 
5. For any point u element of upper Su ∈S there exists a unique face of S containing u in its 
relative interior. This is precisely the smallest face of S containing u. 
6. F is exposed if and only if for every face upper F primeF ′ strictly containing upper F commaF, there is 
script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗with script l vertical bar Subscript upper S Baseline greater than or slanted equals alpha commaℓ|S ⩾α, such that script l Subscript vertical bar Sub Subscript upper F Subscript Baseline identical to alphaℓ|F ≡α but script l vertical bar Subscript upper F Sub Superscript prime Subscript Baseline not identical to alphaℓ|F ′ ̸≡α. 
Proof (1)–(3) Exercise. 
(4) Let u element of upper S minus r e l i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisu ∈S \relint(S). By the Separation Theorem B.4 (2), there exists script l element of upper V Superscript asteriskℓ∈V ∗
and alpha element of double struck upper Rα ∈R with script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals alphaℓ(u) = α and script l greater than alphaℓ> α on r e l i n t left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisrelint(S). Thus 
StartSet s element of upper S vertical bar script l left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals alpha EndSet{s ∈S | ℓ(s) = α}
is a suitable exposed face of S. 
(5) Let F be the intersection of all faces containing u. Then F is a face of S by 
Exercise B.16 (1), and therefore obviously the smallest face containing u. If  u were 
not contained in the relative interior of F, it would be contained in a proper face of 
F (by (4)), which would also be a face of  S (by (2)), a contradiction. If upper F primeF ′ is another

face containing u, then upper F subset of or equal to upper F primeF ⊆F ′ by deﬁnition of F. So if upper F subset of or not equals upper F primeF ⊊F ′, then u cannot be 
contained in the relative interior of upper F primeF ′. 
(6) If F is exposed, there exists such script lℓby deﬁnition. Conversely, let F be a face 
of S with this property. We claim that F is the intersection of all exposed faces of 
S that contain F. The statement then follows from Exercise B.17 (3). Denote this 
intersection by upper F primeF ′. Then upper F subset of or equal to upper F primeF ⊆F ′ is clear, using (4). In case upper F subset of or not equals upper F primeF ⊊F ′ we could choose 
script l element of upper Vℓ∈V as in the assumption. Then the exposed face of S deﬁned by script lℓcontains F but 
not upper F primeF ′, a contradiction. 
⊓⊔
Exercise B.19 
Let upper S subset of or equal to upper VS ⊆V be a closed convex set. Show that all maximal proper faces of S are 
exposed. 
B.3
Semideﬁnite Programming 
We now give a very brief introduction into the theory of semideﬁnite programming. 
Since spectrahedra and their shadows are precisely the feasible sets for these types 
of optimization problems (as we will see), a short such section must not be missing 
from this book. A semideﬁnite program is a convex optimization problem that can 
be written in the following form, usually called the primal form: 
(P)
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column Find 2nd Column inf left angle bracket upper B comma upper X right angle bracket 2nd Row 1st Column subject to 2nd Column left angle bracket upper A Subscript i Baseline comma upper X right angle bracket equals c Subscript i Baseline for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma n 3rd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column upper X greater than or slanted equals 0 period EndLayout right brace in the variable upper X element of upper S y m Subscript s Baseline comma left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis

where upper A 1 comma ellipsis comma upper A Subscript n Baseline comma upper B element of upper S y m Subscript s BaselineA1, . . . , An, B ∈Syms and c element of double struck upper R Superscript nc ∈Rn are given. Thus the problem is to 
compute the minimum (or inﬁmum) of the linear function upper X right arrow from bar left angle bracket upper B comma upper X right angle bracketX →⟨B, X⟩on the 
space of symmetric matrices of size s, under the constraint that X should be 
contained in the spectrahedron deﬁned by the linear equations left angle bracket upper A Subscript i Baseline comma upper X right angle bracket equals c Subscript i⟨Ai, X⟩= ci. Here, 
the spectrahedron is seen as an afﬁne section of the psd cone, i.e., as a set of matrices 
as in Remark 2.7 (2). 
Starting in the 1990s, efﬁcient algorithms for solving semideﬁnite programs have 
been developed, based on so-called interior-point methods. This is the main reason 
for the current interest in spectrahedra, but is outside the scope of this book (see for 
example [27,78,101,102,105] for much more information). But let us mention that 
duality plays an extremely important role in solving semideﬁnite programs. To the 
primal semideﬁnite program (P) above, there is a corresponding dual program 
(D)
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column Find 2nd Column sup left angle bracket c comma y right angle bracket 2nd Row 1st Column subject to 2nd Column upper B minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts y Subscript i Baseline upper A Subscript i Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0 EndLayout right brace in the variable y element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline period left parenthesis upper D right parenthesis Find

easily checked that the optimal value of the dual program is always less or equal to 
the optimal value of the primal problem. This already provides an error bound when

solving both problems at the same time numerically. The usefulness of duality in 
solving semideﬁnite programs also stems from optimality results like the following. 
Theorem B.20 (Duality Theorem) 
Consider the semideﬁnite programs (P) and (D) above. Assume that the 
matrices upper A 1 comma ellipsis comma upper A Subscript n BaselineA1, . . . , An are linearly independent and that both (P) and (D) 
possess strictly feasible points. Then there is no duality gap, meaning the 
optimal values of both problems coincide. Furthermore, upper X primeX′ is an optimal 
solution of (P) and y primey′ an optimal solution of (D) if and only if 
left angle bracket upper X prime comma upper B minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts y prime Subscript i Baseline upper A Subscript i Baseline right angle bracket equals 0 period⟨X′, B −

Proof See for example [3], Section IV.10. 
⊓⊔
Here, a strictly feasible point of (P) is a positive deﬁnite matrix X satisfying the 
constraints in (P), and for (D) it is some y element of double struck upper R Superscript ny ∈Rn with upper B minus sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts y Subscript i Baseline upper A Subscript i Baseline greater than 0B −
i yiAi > 0 . This  
duality theorem provides only one example of various assumptions one can make 
on the dual pair (P), (D) implying that there is no duality gap. The condition here is 
usually called the interior point or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. 
Now ﬁnally suppose we are given a general convex programming problem of the 
form 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column Find 2nd Column inf script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis 2nd Row 1st Column subject to 2nd Column u element of upper S EndLayout right brace in the variable u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Find
inf ℓ(u)


in the variable u ∈Rn
where S is some convex subset of double struck upper R Superscript nRn and script lℓa linear functional. If we wish to 
apply semideﬁnite programming methods, it makes little difference whether we 
can represent S as a spectrahedron upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS = S(M), or only as a spectrahedral shadow 
upper S equals pi Subscript x Baseline script upper S left parenthesis upper M left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis right parenthesisS = πxS(M(x, y)). In either case, we just solve the program for the spectrahedron 
script upper S left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisS(M). What matters much more is how and whether we can actually ﬁnd the 
representing linear matrix polynomial upper M commaM, and whether the size of the matrices and 
the number of extra variables y are not too large. So we should always keep the 
following in mind: 
For optimization, lifted representations are no worse than non-lifted representa-
tions, even though the geometry is very different. 
Let us conclude this section with an exercise relating semideﬁnite programming 
to general conic programming.

Lagrange Multipliers and Convex Optimization 
The basic idea in Sect. 3.5 is to study representations of (non-linear) Lagrange 
functions of a linear polynomial, in order to represent it as an element of a quadratic 
module. To explain this, we need a bit of background and terminology from general 
(polynomial) optimization. The following is a special case of the Karush-Kuhn-
Tucker theorem. 
Theorem B.22 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS = S(p1, . . . , pr) ⊆Rn be a basic closed set. Let q element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracketq ∈R[x] and assume 
that u element of upper Su ∈S is a point in which q attains its minimum on S. Assume further that 
there is v element of double struck upper R Superscript nv ∈Rn with 
StartLayout Enlarged left brace 1st Row 1st Column left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma v right angle bracket greater than 0 2nd Column if degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 2 2nd Row 1st Column left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma v right angle bracket greater than or slanted equals 0 2nd Column if degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis less than or slanted equals 1 EndLayout

⟨∇pi(u), v⟩⩾0 if deg(pi) ⩽1
whenever p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0pi(u) = 0. Then there exist lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript r Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0λ1, . . . , λr ⩾0 such that 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column nabla q left parenthesis u right parenthesis 2nd Column equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript r Endscripts lamda Subscript i Baseline nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis 2nd Row 1st Column lamda Subscript i Baseline p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis 2nd Column equals 0 for all i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma r period EndLayout∇q(u) =


i=1
λi∇pi(u)
λipi(u) = 0
for all i = 1, . . . , r.
(The same holds if q comma p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselineq, p1, . . . , pr are just continuously differentiable func-
tions.) 
The constants lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript r Baselineλ1, . . . , λr are called Lagrange multipliers for q at the minimizer 
u. The second statement, which just says that the Lagrange multipliers for inactive 
inequalities are zero, is called complementary slackness. There are a number of

154
B
Convexity
conditions, called constraint qualiﬁcations, implying the existence of Lagrange 
multipliers in a minimizer. The one stated here is the Mangasarian-Fromowitz 
constraint qualiﬁcation. We prove the theorem only in the special case where the 
objective function q is linear. This is all we need in Sect. 3.5. See for example [27], 
Theorem 2.2.5 et seq. for a full proof. 
Proof of Theorem B.22 Let p equals script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1p = ℓ∈R[x]1 and let u element of upper Su ∈S be a minimiser of script lℓon 
S. It is not restrictive to assume that u equals 0u = 0 and script l left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0ℓ(u) = 0. Furthermore, we may 
assume that p 1 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals p Subscript m Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0p1(0) = · · · = pm(0) = 0 and p Subscript m plus 1 Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis greater than 0pm+1(0), . . . , pr(0) > 0 for some 
m greater than or slanted equals 1m ⩾1, i.e., exactly the ﬁrst m inequalities are active at 0. We show that there are 
lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript m Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0λ1, . . . , λm ⩾0 with 
nabla script l left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript m Endscripts lamda Subscript i Baseline nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis∇ℓ(0) =
m

i=1
λi∇pi(0)
and set lamda Subscript m plus 1 Baseline equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals lamda Subscript r Baseline equals 0λm+1 = · · · = λr = 0. Suppose for contradiction that such lamda Subscript iλi do not exist. 
We may then apply Farkas’s Lemma B.23, and conclude that there exists w element of double struck upper R Superscript nw ∈Rn
such that 
left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w right angle bracket greater than or slanted equals 0 for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma m⟨∇pi(0), w⟩⩾0 for i = 1, . . . , m
but left angle bracket nabla script l left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w right angle bracket less than 0⟨∇ℓ(0), w⟩< 0. On the other hand, we may pick v element of double struck upper R Superscript nv ∈Rn as in the hypothesis. 
Choose epsilon greater than 0ε > 0 with 
left angle bracket nabla script l left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w plus epsilon v right angle bracket less than 0 period⟨∇ℓ(0), w + εv⟩< 0.
Now if 1 less than or slanted equals i less than or slanted equals m1 ⩽i ⩽m and degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 2deg(pi) ⩾2, then left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w plus epsilon v right angle bracket greater than 0⟨∇pi(0), w + εv⟩> 0 for all epsilon greater than 0ε > 0, 
which implies 
p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis delta left parenthesis w plus epsilon v right parenthesis right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0pi(δ(w + εv)) ⩾0
for all sufﬁciently small delta greater than 0δ > 0, since p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0pi(0) = 0. The same holds if degree left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals 1deg(pi) = 1, 
since in this case we have 
p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis delta left parenthesis w plus epsilon v right parenthesis right parenthesis equals delta left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w plus epsilon v right angle bracket greater than or slanted equals 0 periodpi(δ(w + εv)) = δ⟨∇pi(0), w + εv⟩⩾0.
Finally, we may also assume that the same holds for the inactive inequalities (for 
i equals m plus 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = m+1, . . . , r), by making deltaδ smaller if necessary. But this implies that delta left parenthesis w plus epsilon v right parenthesisδ(w +εv)
is a point in S for which 
script l left parenthesis delta left parenthesis w plus epsilon v right parenthesis right parenthesis equals delta left angle bracket nabla script l left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma w plus epsilon v right angle bracket less than 0 commaℓ(δ(w + εv)) = δ⟨∇ℓ(0), w + εv⟩< 0,
contradicting the fact that 0 equals script l left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis0 = ℓ(0) is the minimum of script lℓon S.
⊓⊔

The following basic lemma was used in the proof (and in fact also earlier in 
Example 3.21). 
Lemma B.23 (Farkas’s Lemma) 
Let c 1 comma ellipsis comma c Subscript m Baseline element of double struck upper R Superscript nc1, . . . , cm ∈Rn and let 
upper P equals left brace u element of double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline vertical bar left angle bracket c Subscript i Baseline comma u right angle bracket greater than or slanted equals 0 for all i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma m right brace periodP =

u ∈Rn | ⟨ci, u⟩⩾0 for all i = 1, . . . , m

.
Then 
upper P Superscript or Baseline equals c o n e left parenthesis c 1 comma ellipsis comma c Subscript m Baseline right parenthesis periodP ∨= cone(c1, . . . , cm).
In other words, for c element of double struck upper R Superscript nc ∈Rn there either exists u element of upper Pu ∈P such that left angle bracket c comma u right angle bracket less than 0 comma⟨c, u⟩< 0, or 
there exist lamda 1 comma ellipsis comma lamda Subscript m Baseline greater than or slanted equals 0λ1, . . . , λm ⩾0 with c equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript m Endscripts lamda Subscript i Baseline c Subscript ic = m
i=1 λici. 
Proof By deﬁnition we have c o n e left parenthesis c 1 comma ellipsis comma c Subscript m Baseline right parenthesis Superscript or Baseline equals upper Pcone(c1, . . . , cm)∨= P, so that 
upper P Superscript or Baseline equals c o n e left parenthesis c 1 comma ellipsis comma c Subscript m Baseline right parenthesis Superscript or or Baseline equals c l o s left parenthesis c o n e left parenthesis c 1 comma ellipsis comma c Subscript m Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesisP ∨= cone(c1, . . . , cm)∨∨= clos (cone(c1, . . . , cm))
by Theorem B.5. However, a ﬁnitely generated convex cone is always closed, which 
can for example be deduced by reducing to the positive orthant via Carathéodory’s 
Theorem (see for example [3] Theorem 2.3). This ﬁnishes the proof. 
⊓⊔
Recall that a function f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R is concave on a convex subset upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn if 
f left parenthesis lamda u plus left parenthesis 1 minus lamda right parenthesis v right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals lamda f left parenthesis u right parenthesis plus left parenthesis 1 minus lamda right parenthesis f left parenthesis v right parenthesisf (λu + (1 −λ)v) ⩾λf (u) + (1 −λ)f (v)
holds for all u comma v element of upper Su, v ∈S and lamda element of left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracketλ ∈[0, 1]. If the inequality is strict for all u not equals v comma lamda element of left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesisu ̸= v, λ ∈
(0, 1), f is called strictly concave. It is called (strictly) convex if the opposite 
inequality holds, i.e., if negative f−f is (strictly) concave. Some essential facts are contained 
in the following exercises. 
Exercise B.24 
Let upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn be a convex set and f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R a function. 
1. If f is continuously differentiable, then f is concave on S if and only if 
f left parenthesis v right parenthesis less than or slanted equals f left parenthesis u right parenthesis plus left angle bracket nabla f left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma v minus u right angle bracketf (v) ⩽f (u) + ⟨∇f (u), v −u⟩
holds for all u comma v element of upper Su, v ∈S.

Convexity
2. If f is twice continuously differentiable, then f is concave on S if and only if 
its Hessian nabla squared f∇2f is negative semideﬁnite in all points u element of upper Su ∈S. Furthermore, if 
left parenthesis nabla squared f right parenthesis left parenthesis u right parenthesis(∇2f )(u) is negative deﬁnite for all u element of upper Su ∈S, then f is strictly concave on S. Give  
an example showing that the converse is false. 
Exercise B.25 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisS = S(p1, . . . , pr) be a basic closed set, and suppose that p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr are 
concave on S. Show that S is convex. 
Exercise B.26 
If upper S subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript nS ⊆Rn is compact and convex, and f colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper Rf : Rn →R is concave on S, then there is 
an extreme point of S in which f attains its minimum on S. 
Exercise B.27 
1. The set of extreme points of a compact convex subset of double struck upper R squaredR2 is compact. 
2. Give an example of a compact convex subset of double struck upper R cubedR3 whose set of extreme points 
is not closed. 
Corollary B.28 
Let upper S equals script upper S left parenthesis p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baseline right parenthesisS = S(p1, . . . , pr) be compact and convex with non-empty interior, and 
suppose that p 1 comma ellipsis comma p Subscript r Baselinep1, . . . , pr are concave on S. Then Lagrange multipliers exist 
for any linear polynomial at any minimizer on S. 
Proof We can assume p Subscript i Baseline not equals 0pi ̸= 0 for all i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r. Since S has non-empty 
interior, there exists a point u 0 element of upper Su0 ∈S with p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis greater than 0pi(u0) > 0 for i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ri = 1, . . . , r, since 
otherwise the product p 1 midline horizontal ellipsis p Subscript r Baselinep1 · · · pr would vanish on S, contradicting the nonempty 
interior assumption. 
Now let script l element of double struck upper R left bracket x right bracket Subscript 1ℓ∈R[x]1 and let u element of upper Su ∈S be a minimizer of script lℓon S. If p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis equals 0pi(u) = 0, then 
0 less than p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u 0 right parenthesis less than or slanted equals p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis plus left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma u 0 minus u right angle bracket equals left angle bracket nabla p Subscript i Baseline left parenthesis u right parenthesis comma u 0 minus u right angle bracket comma0 < pi(u0) ⩽pi(u) + ⟨∇pi(u), u0 −u⟩= ⟨∇pi(u), u0 −u⟩,
since p Subscript ipi is concave on S (using Exercise B.24 (1)). Hence the hypotheses of 
Theorem B.22 are satisﬁed for v equals u 0 minus uv = u0 −u. 
⊓⊔
Note that in the proof of the corollary we did not need the assumption that script lℓhas 
degree 1. But in this way, it relies only on the special case of Theorem B.22 which 
we have actually proven.
