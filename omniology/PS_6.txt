KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 6
This problem set focuses primarily on material covered in Week 6 (Lecture 8), so I recommend you to
watch the lecture and attempt Assignment 8 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing
(and submitting) the problem set is Monday March 17 at 9:00AM US-PST. Note that you can save your
entries as you work through the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission, but
once you submit your answers no further changes are possible.
1. Is the following proof valid or not?
Theorem: For any natural number n, 2n > 2n.
Proof: By induction. The case n = 1 is obviously true, so assume the inequality holds for n.
That is, assume 2n > 2n. Then
2n+1 = 2·2n > 2·2n (by the induction hypothesis) = 4n = 2n+2n ≥2n+2 (since n ≥1) = 2(n+1)
This establishes the inequality for n + 1. Hence, by induction, the inequality holds for all n.
2. Is the following proof valid or not?
Theorem: If a nonempty ﬁnite set X has n elements, then X has exactly 2n distinct subsets.
Proof: By induction on n.
The case n = 1 is true, since if X is a set with exactly one element, say X = {a}, then X has the
two subsets ∅and X itself.
Assume the theorem is true for n. Let X be a set of n + 1 elements. Let a ∈X and let Y =
X −{a} (i.e., obtain Y by removing a from X).
Then Y is a set with n elements.
By the
induction hypothesis, Y has 2n subsets. List them as Y1, . . . , Y2n. Then all the subsets of X are
Y1, . . . , Y2n, Y1 ∪{a}, . . . , Y2n ∪{a} (i.e., the subsets of Y together with the subsets of Y with a
added to each one). There are 2 · 2n = 2n+1 sets in this list. This establishes the theorem for n + 1.
Hence, by induction, it is true for all n.
3. True or false? If p is a prime number, then √p is irrational. (Before entering your answer, you
should either construct a proof of truth or ﬁnd a counter-example, so you are sure. After you
have completed the problem set, you should write up your proof or counter-example and share it
with your study group for feedback. You can assume that if p is prime, then whenever p divides a
product ab, p divides at least one of a, b. )
4. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
Theorem For any natural number n,

Proof: By induction.
For n = 1, the left-hand side is
1
1.2 = 1
2 and the right-hand side is 1
2, so the identity is valid for
n = 1.
Assume the identity holds for n. Then:

(n + 1)(n + 2)
=
n(n + 2) + 1
(n + 1)(n + 2)
=
n2 + 2n + 1
(n + 1)(n + 2)
=
(n + 1)2
(n + 1)(n + 2)
=
n + 1
n + 2
This is the identity for n + 1. Hence, by induction, the theorem is proved.
5. This theorem is obviously false. Enter the line number of the (false) statement where the proof
goes wrong.
Theorem All Americans are the same age.
Proof:
1. Let S(n) be the statement: In any group of n Americans, everyone in that group has the same
age.
2. We prove S(n) by induction on n.
3. Since everyone in a group of one American has the same age, S(1) is true.
4. Assume S(n) is true for some n.
5. We prove S(n + 1).
6. Let G be an arbitrary group of n + 1 Americans.
7. We show that everyone in G has the same age.
8. We do this by showing that any two members of G have the same age.
9. Let a, b ∈G.
10. Let Ga be the result of removing a from G.
11. Since Ga has n members, b (which is in Ga) has the same age as any other person in Ga.
12. Similarly, if Gb is G with b removed, then a has the same age as any other person in Gb.
13. Now let c be any person in G other than a and b.
14. Then c ∈Ga and c ∈Gb.
15. So, a and b both have the same age as c.
16. Hence a and b have the same age.
17. This proves S(n + 1).
18. Hence, by induction, S(n) is true for all n.
19. This implies that all Americans have the same age.
