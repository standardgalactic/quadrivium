BUILD A CARPORT 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
You only need basic DIY and woodworking skills to build a 
carport. The most important part of the job is setting the 
supporting posts truly vertical - a job for which another pair 
of hands will be helpful. 
  
 
 
There are no particular safety risks involved. Make sure that 
any power tools are plugged into an RCD adaptor or RCD 
socket outlet. Set up stepladders or other access equipment 
on level ground, and don't overstretch on them. 
  
 
 
If you have space off-road for your car, a carport is an 
inexpensive way of giving it some shelter from the elements.
You can adapt the structure to the size you need and the 
space you have available for it. 
  
A carport is more than just a protective canopy for your car. 
It can do double duty as a porch over a side door, and 
provides useful undercover space for storage. It can be used 
as a work area for DIY or car maintenance, a children's play 
area, even somewhere to dry clothes on wet days.  
 
2  -  Planning the carport  
A carport is classed as an outbuilding as far as planning 
rules are concerned, wherever it is sited. So long as it does 
not project in front of the local building line (usually the 
front wall of your house), is not more than 3m (10ft) high, 
and does not result in more than half of the garden being 
built over, then you do not need to apply for planning 
consent.  
 
 
 
If you are in any doubt about whether your proposed 
structure needs consent, check with your local authority 
planning department.  
 
 
 
As far as the need for Building Regulations approval is 
concerned, a carport is exempt so long as its floor area does 
not exceed 30m² (325ft²) and the structure is open on at 
least two sides.  
 
3  - Designing the carport 

The simplest way of building 
a carport alongside the house 
is to erect three or four sto
timber posts along one side 
of the site to support a 
that will carry the outer ed
of the roof, and to fix a 
horizontal timber wallplate to
the house wall to support the 
other edge. Then joists are 
fixed into notches cut in the 
beam and wallplate, and 
corrugated plastic roo
r framework (1).

T
it. This can run from front to back or from the house wall to 
the opposite side of the roof. It is easier to waterproof the 
junction between the roof and the house wall if the drainage
runs from end to end, since the flashing tape will run parallel
to the corrugations in the roofing sheet rather than at right 
angles to them.  
 
 
A
 
rainwater does not simply drip off. Fit an outlet and a 
downpipe to discharge the water into a nearby gully if 
available. If there is no gully nearby, collect the rainwater 
run-off in one or more water butts, for use in the garden.

he roof is supported on two mai
T
sawn timber running the length of the carport. One, the 
wallplate, is fixed to the house wall with masonry bolts. T
other is screwed to the posts at the outer side of the 
building. Both are notched at intervals to a depth of 50
to receive the sawn timber joists; you need seven for a 
carport 6m (20ft) long, spaced at 1m (3ft 3in) centres.  
 
 
 

Cut both beams to length, 
then mark the positions for 
the notches on both together 
to ensure that their positions 
coincide exactly. Saw out the 
open end notches, and saw 
down the sides of the others. 
Then use a wood chisel to cut 
out the waste wood and leave
notches 50mm deep (2). 
Treat the newly-exposed 
surfaces with wood 
preservative.  
 
 
 
Drill clearance holes through the wallplate midway between 
the notches, using a twist-drill bit sized to match the 
diameter of the masonry bolts you are using. Use the posts 
you will be fitting at the other side of the carport to support 
the wallplate temporarily against the house wall at the 
required level - at a minimum height of 2m (6ft 6in) to allow 
adequate headroom.  
 
 
 
Create the necessary fall along the length of the carport by 
lowering one end of the wallplate by about 1mm for every 
100mm of wallplate length - for example, a drop of 60mm 
for a carport 6m long.  
 
 
 
Mark the positions of the fixings on the wall through the 
clearance holes in the wallplate, then set it aside.  
 
 
 
Use a large-diameter 
masonry drill bit to drill the 
holes for the masonry stud 
anchors. Insert them so their 
sleeves are fully inside the 
holes and take off the nuts 
and washers. Lift up the 
wallplate (with help if you 
need it) and locate the 
clearance holes over the 
projecting bolts. Fit a washer 
on each one and hand-
tighten the nuts. Then tighten them fully with a spanner to 
expand the sleeve within the wall and make a secure fixing 
(3).  
 
5 -  Position the posts  
 

The simplest way of securing 
the posts on an existing 
concrete base is to use bolt-
down fence support sockets 
(4). These are fixed at the 
post positions with four small 
masonry bolts set in holes 
drilled in the concrete. 
 
 
 
Measure the carport width out from the house wall at 90° at 
each end and at the centre of the wallplate, and mark the 
socket positions. Place a socket at each position and mark 
the bolt positions through the fixing holes onto the concrete. 
Drill the holes, insert the sleeves, set the sockets in place 
and tighten the bolts down to fix each one in place.  
 
 
 
Stand the first post in its 
socket and temporarily nail 
lengths of scrap timber to 
two adjacent faces of the 
post to brace it upright. Then 
get it precisely vertical using 
a spirit level (5). Screw the 
socket to the base of the 
post. Repeat the process for 
the other posts. Leave the 
braces in position until the 
roof structure is complete.  
 
6 - Fit the main bearer 
 
Drill screw clearance holes through the face of the outer side 
beam at positions to match the post spacing.  
 
 
 
With help, hold the beam up 
and use G-clamps to secure it
to the outer faces of the 
posts at roughly the right 
level. Place a joist across the 
high end of the roof (6). Use 
your spirit level to get this 
truly horizontal, loosening th
clamps slightly so you can 
move the end of the outer
beam up or down as 
necessary. When the joist is 
level, tighten the clamp and screw the end of the beam to 
the first post. Use four 75mm screws to make a strong and 
secure fixing.

Simply drop each one into its notches and screw it in place
