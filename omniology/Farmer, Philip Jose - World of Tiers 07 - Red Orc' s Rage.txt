CHAPTER 1
November 26, 1979
JIM GRIMSON HAD never planned to eat his father's balls.
He had not expected to make love to twenty of his sisters.
He could not foresee that, while riding a white Steed, he
would save his mother from a prison and a killer.
How could he, seventeen years old in October of 1979,
know that he had created this seemingly ten-billion-year-old
universe?
Though his father often called him a dumbbell and his
teachers obviously thought he was one, Jim did read a lot.
He knew the current theory of how the universe was
supposed to have started. In the very beginning, before
Time had started, the Primal Ball was the only thing
existing. Outside of it was nothing, not even Space. All of
the future universe, constellations, galaxies, everything,
was packed into a sphere the size of his eyeball. This had
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
gotten so hot and dense that it had blown up, out, and away.
That explosion was called the Big Bang. Eons afterwards,
the expanding matter had become stars, planets, and life on
Earth.
That theory was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!
Matter was not the only thing that could be put under
tremendous heat and pressure. The soul could be squeezed
too much. Then: BOOM!
God Almighty and then some! Less than a month ago, he
had reluctantly entered the mental ward of Wellington
Hospital, Belmont City, Tarhee County, Ohio State. Then
he had become, among other things, the Lord of several
universes, a wanderer in many, and a slave in one.
At this moment, he was back on his native Earth, same
hospital. He was freezing with misery, burning with fury,
and pacing back and forth in a locked room.
Jim's psychiatrist. Doctor Porsena, had said that Jim's
trips into other worlds were mental, though that did not
mean they were not real. Thoughts were not ghosts. They
existed. Therefore, they were real.
Jim knew that his experiences in those pocket universes
were as real as his pain when, not so long ago, he had
driven his fist against his bedroom wall. And was not the
blood flowing from the whiplashes on his back a witness to
quell all doubts of his story? However, Doctor Porsena,
scientist, rationalist, and rationalizer, would explain all
puzzling phenomena with superb logic.
Jim usually loved the doctor. Just now, he hated him.

Novembers, 1979
/\LL PREVIOUS PATIENTS," Doctor Porsena said, "have
tried other types of therapy. These failed to improve the
patients, though part of that might be attributed to the
patients' hostility to psychiatric therapy of any kind."
"Old Chinese saying," Jim Grimson said. " 'You have to
be nuts if you go to a psychiatrist.' Another celestial
proverb. 'Insanity is not what it's cracked up to be.'"
L. Robert Porsena, M.D., F.C.P., head of the Wellington
Hospital psychiatric unit, smiled thinly. Jim thought that he
was probably thinking. Another smart-ass kid I got to deal
with. Heard his rest-room-graffiti quotations a thousand
times. 'Celestial proverb' indeed. He's trying to impress
me, show me that he isn't just another ignorant drooling
pimpled drugged-up rock-freak youth who's gone off his
rocker.

On the other hand. Doctor Porsena might not be thinking
that at all. It was hard to know what went on behind that
handsome face that looked almost exactly like Julius Cae-
sar's bust except for the black Fu Manchu mustache and the
patent-leather mod haircut. He smiled a lot. His keen
light-blue eyes reminded Jim of the Mad Hatter's song in
Lewis Can-oil's Alice book. "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at! Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle—"
Doctor Porsena's adolescent patients said he was a
shaman, a sort of miracle worker, a metropolitan medicine
man with control over magical forces and far-out spirits.
Doctor Porsena started to say something but was inter-
rupted by his desk intercom. He flipped a switch and said,
"Winnie, I told you! No calls!"
Winnie, the beautiful black secretary sitting at her desk
on the other side of the wall, evidently had something
urgent on the line. Doctor Porsena said, "Sorry, Jim. This
won't take more than a minute."
Jim only half listened while he gazed out the window.
The psychiatric unit and Porsena's office were on the second
story. The window was, like all windows in this area,
covered with thick iron bars. Past breaks in the buildings
beyond, Jim could see the tops of the waterfront structures.
These were on the banks of the Tarhee River, which ran into
the Mahoning River a mile to the south.
He could also see the spires of St. Grobian's and of St.
Stephan's. His mother had probably attended early morning
Mass at the latter today. That was the only time she had now
to go to worship. She was working at two jobs, partly
because of him. The fire had destroyed everything except

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
the painting of his grandfather, which had been brought out
of the house along with him. His parents had moved into a
relatively cheap furnished apartment some blocks from the
4
old house. Too close to the Hungarian neighborhood to suit
Eric Grimson. That ungrateful attitude was just like his
father. Eva's relatives—in fact, the entire Magyar area—
had contributed money to help them out of their plight. A
large part of the cash had been raised by a lottery. This was
remarkable, for charitable donations had dropped consider-
ably in the past few years because of the economic distress
in the Youngstown area. But Eva's family and friends and
church had come through.
Though she had been a semioutcast because of her
marriage, she was still a fellow Hungarian. And, now that
she was down, she should have learned her lesson and be
properly contrite, as the old phrase went.
The Crimsons had not been able to buy the insurance to
cover property damage or loss from the collapse of under-
ground structures. Though they did have fire insurance,
they would not be paid if the fire had been caused by an act
of God. That had not yet been determined.
Eric Grimson could not afford a lawyer. But one of Eva's
cousins, an attorney, had volunteered to take the case. If he
won, he got ten percent of the payoff. If he lost, he got
nothing. Clearly, he was donating his time because of clan
unity and because he felt sorry for his cousin. That she was
married to a non-Magyar who was also a shiftless bum and
an atheist who had been a Protestant was bad enough. But
to lose her house and all her possessions and to have a son
who'd gone crazy . . . that was too much. Though a
lawyer, he had a big heart.
The money needed to keep Jim in therapy was provided
by the medical insurance, but the quarterly payments were
very high. Eva Grimson had taken on another job to pay for
them. The two times she had visited Jim, she had looked
very tired. Her weight had gone down swiftly, her cheeks
were hollowing, and her eyes were ringed with black.
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim had felt so guilty that he offered to quit therapy. His
mother would not accept that. Her son had been given the
option of taking the therapy or being sentenced to jail. The
district attorney had wanted to treat him as an adult, which
would have meant a more severe sentence. She would do all
she could to prevent that. Besides, though she did not say
so, she could not hide her belief that Jim was genuinely
crazy and would remain so unless he was treated by a
psychiatrist.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (3 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Jim's father had not visited him. Jim did not ask his
mother why Eric Grimson stayed away. One reason was that
Jim did not wish to see his father. Another was that he knew
that Eric was deeply ashamed because he had a "crazy"
child. People would think that insanity ran in the family.
Maybe it did in Eva's family. All Hungarians were crazy.
But not the Crimsons, by God!
Actually, Jim had been very fortunate in being taken into
therapy so quickly. Because of the lack of funds in the area,
programs for treating the mentally disturbed had been cut
far back. Normally, Jim would have been in the back of the
long waiting line. He did not know why or how he had been
jumped ahead to favorite-son status.
He suspected that Sam Wyzak's uncle, the judge, had
used his influence. Also, his mother's cousin, the attorney,
maybe brought some pressure to bear, probably not all of it
with strictly legal procedures. Though Doctor Porsena
would not comment on how Jim had been leapfrogged over
others, he may have had something to do with it. Jim had
the impression that the psychiatrist thought that he was a
very interesting case because of his history of stigmata and
hallucinations.
Maybe he was just being egotistical. After all, he was
really nothing unusual, just another jerkoff, blue-collar,
mongrel, squarehead-Hunkie punk. When he got down to
the ungilded basics, that was what he was.
Doctor Porsena finally hung up the phone.
He said, "We were talking about other patients now in
this program who had previously tried other types of
therapy. Those had not succeeded with these patients, all of
whom were hostile to psychiatric therapy of any kind.
"What I'm offering you—there's no pressure or force
used here—is immediate entrance into a type of therapy
we've had much success with."
Doctor Porsena spoke very rapidly but clearly. He was
remarkable in that his speech had very few of the pauses or
hesitations halting most people's talk. No uh, ah, well, you
know.
"It's not easy; no therapy is easy. Blood, sweat, and
tears, and all that. And, like all therapy, the success
depends basically upon you. We don't cure the patient. He
or she cures himself with our guidance. Which means that
you have to want to be able to handle your problems,
genuinely desire to do so."
The doctor was silent for a moment. Jim looked around
the office. It seemed quite luxurious to him with its thick
(Persian?) carpet, overstuffed leather chairs and couch, big
desk of some kind of glossy hardwood, the classy-looking
wallpaper, the many diplomas and testimonials on the wall,
the wall niches with busts of famous people in them, and the
paintings which seemed abstract or surrealistic or whatever
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (4 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

to Jim, who knew little about art.
"You understand everything I've said?" Porsena asked.
"If there's anything you don't comprehend perfectly, say so.
Patient or doctor, we're all here to leam. There's no shame
in exposing one's ignorance. I expose my own quite often.
I don't know everything. Nobody does."
"Sure, I understand. So far. At least you're not talking
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
down to me, just using monosyllables, none of that psycho-
logical gobbledygook. I appreciate that."
Doctor Porsena's hands were flat on top of Jim's opened
case file. They were slim and delicate and had long thin
fingers. Jim had heard that he was an excellent pianist who
usually played classical music, though he sometimes played
jazz, dixie, and ragtime. He would even knock out some
rock now and then.
He only had two hands but could have used four. He was
very busy, which was to be expected. Not only did he run
the psychiatric unit of the hospital, he had a private practice
in an office a block away on St. Elizabeth Street. He was
also head of an organization of northeast Ohio psychiatrists
and a teacher at a medical college.
Porsena's accomplishments awed Jim. But what most
impressed him was the doctor's 1979 silver Lamborghini.
Now, that was in the WOW! category.
The doctor turned a page of the file and read a line or
two. Then he leaned back.
"You seem to be a wide reader," he said, "though you
prefer science fiction. So many young people do. I have
been a fan of science fiction and fantasy since I started to
read. I began with the Oz books, Grimms' and Lang's fairy
tales, Lewis Can-oil's Alice books. Homer's Odyssey, the
Arabian Nights, Jules Veme, H. G. Wells, and the science
fiction magazines. Tolkien quite captivated me. Then,
while I was in residency in Yale, I read Philip Jose Farmer's
World of Tiers series. Do you know those books?"
"Yeah," Jim said. He straightened up. "Love them! That
Kickaha! But when in hell is Farmer going to finish the
series?"
Porsena shrugged. He was the only man Jim had ever
seen who could make a shrug seem an elegant gesture.
"The point is that, while I was at Yale, I also read a

biography of Lewis Can-oil. A phrase in the commentary on
the chapter in Alice in Wonderland titled 'A Caucus Race
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (5 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

and a Long Tail' sparked something in my mind. I then and
there got the idea for Tiersian therapy."
"What's that?" Jim said. "Tiersian? Oh, you mean from
the World of Tiers?"
"As good a word as any and better than some," Doctor
Porsena said, smiling, "It was only a glimmering of an idea,
a zygote of thought, a brief candlelight that might have been
blown out by the hurly-burly winds of the mundane world
or by common sense and logic rejecting divine inspiration.
But I clung to it, nourished it, cherished it, and at last
brought it to full bloom."
This guy is really something, Jim thought. No wonder
they call him The Shaman.
However, Jim had been misled and deceived by adults so
many times that he did not entirely trust the psychiatrist.
Wait. See if his words matched his deeds.
On the other hand, Porsena was this side of thirty. Old
but not real old. Young-old.
It was a good thing that he was in biology class, Jim
thought. Otherwise, he would not have known what the
doctor was talking about when he had spoken of "zygote of
thought." A zygote was any cell formed by the union of two
gametes. And a gamete was a reproductive cell that could
unite with another similar one to form the cell that develops
into a new individual.
He had started out as a zygote. So had Porsena. So had
most living creatures.
As he listened to the doctor explain the therapy, Jim
understood that, in a psychotherapeutic sense, he was a
gamete. And the object of the therapy was to become a zygote.
That is, a new individual composed of the old personality and
another one which was, at this moment, imaginary.

CHAPTER 3
"T
I HE TIERSIAN THERAPY patients form a small and elite
volunteer group," Doctor Porsena said. "Usually, they start
out with volume one, The Maker of Universes, and read
the rest in proper sequence. They choose a character in the
books and try to BE that character. They adopt all the
mental and emotional characteristics of the role model
whether they're good or bad. As therapy progresses, they
come to a point where they start getting rid of the bad
qualities of the character they've chosen. But they keep the
good features.
"It's rather like a snake shedding its skin. The patient's
uncontrolled delusions, the undesirable emotional factors
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (6 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
which brought him or her here, are gradually replaced by
controlled delusions. The controlled delusions are those
which the patient adopts when he or she becomes, in a
sense, the character in the series.
"There's much more to the treatment than this, but you'll
understand that as therapy proceeds. You follow me?"
JO
"So far," Jim said. "This really works, right?"
"The failure rate is phenomenally low. In your case, even
though you've read the series, you will have to reread it.
The World of Tiers will be your Bible, your key to health if
you work with it and at it."
Jim was silent for a while. He was considering the series
and also wondering which character—some of them were
really vicious—he would like to adopt. To become, as the
doctor said.
The basic premise of the series was that, many thousands
of years ago, only one universe had existed. On one planet
only in that universe was there life. The end of its
evolutionary path was a species that resembled humans.
These had attained a science vastly exceeding anything
Earth had ever known. Eventually, the humans had been
able to make artificial pocket universes.
So knowledgeable and powerful were these beings, they
were able to alter the laws of physics governing each
individual pocket universe. Thus, the rate of acceleration in
a fall toward the center of gravity could be made different
from that in the original world. Another example, one
pocket world might contain a single sun and a single planet.
The World of Tiers, for example. This was an Earth-sized
planet shaped like a terraced Tower of Babylon. Its tiny sun
and tiny moon revolved around it.
Another universe contained a single planet which be-
haved like the plastic in a lavalite bottle. Its shape kept
changing. Mountains arose and sank before your very eyes.
Rivers were formed within a few days and then disap-
peared. Seas rushed in to fill quickly forming hollows. Parts
of the planet broke off—just like the thermoplastic in the
liquid of a lavalite bottle—whirled around, changing shape,
then fell slowly to the main body.
Many of the Lords, as the humans came to call them-
//
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
selves, left the original universe to live in their artificial pocket
universes or designer worlds. Then a war made the planet unfit
for life forever and killed all those then living on it. Only the
Lords inhabiting the pocket worlds were saved.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (7 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Thousands of years passed while more artificial universes
were made by the Lords living in those already made at the
time of the war. These were inhabited by the life forms that the
Lords had introduced on the planets of their private cosmoses.
Many of these forms had been made in the laboratories of the
Lords. There were other humans than the Lords on these. But
these lesser beings had been made in the laboratories, though
their models were the Lords themselves.
Access to these pocket worlds was gotten through "gates."
These were interdimensional routes activated by various kinds
of codes. As the Lords became increasingly decadent, they
lost the knowledge of how to make new universes. The sons
and daughters of the Lords wanted their own worlds, but they
no longer had the means to create them. Thus, as was
inevitable, there was a power struggle among them to gain
control of the limited number of worlds.
By the time The Maker of Universes began, in the late
1960s, many Lords had been killed or dispossessed. Even
those who had their own universes wanted to conquer
others. That they could live without aging for hundreds of
millennia meant that most of them had become bored and
vicious. Invading other worlds and killing the Lords there
had become a great game.
If they could not create, they could destroy.
The World of Tiers series was clearly an anticipation of
the "Dungeons and Dragons" games which were so popular
among youths. Its gates, the traps set by the Lords in the
gates, the ingenuity necessary to get through the gates, and
the dangerous worlds in which a wrong decision would land
a character prefigured the D-and-D games. Jim was sur-
72
RED ORC'S RAGE
prised that the series had not been adapted to such a game.
He was even more surprised to find that the books had
become a tool used in psychiatric therapy. But it seemed
like a great idea. It certainly appealed to him far more than
conventional therapy, Freudian, Jungian, or whatever.
Though he did not know much about any of the various
psychiatric schools, he nevertheless did not like them.
Rest-room graffiti flashed across his mindscreen.
"Mental illness can be fun." "Over the edge is better than
under it." "Nobody catches schizophrenia from a toilet seat."
Doctor Porsena looked at the clock on his desk. A puppet
of Time, Jim thought. Doctors and lawyers, like railroads,
ran on Newtonian time. They knew nothing of Einsteinian.
No loafing and inviting your soul, to hell with relativity.
But that was how they got things done.
The psychiatrist rose, and he said, "On to other things,
Jim. Excelsior! Ever upward and onward! Junior Wunier
will give you the books, no charge. He'll also acquaint you
with the rules and regulations. May you be safe from the

curving carballoy claws of Klono, and may the Force be
with you. See you later."
Jim left the room thinking that the doctor was really
something. That reference to the Force. That was from Star
Wars, and any kid in America would recognize it. But that
bit about Klono. How many would know that Klono was a
sort of spaceman's god, a deity with golden gills, brazen
hooves, indium guts, and all that? Klono was the god whom
spacefarers swore by in E. E. Smith's Lensman series.
Jim found Junior Wunier at the officer of the day's post
near the elevators. Junior Wunier! What a name for parents
to stick a kid with! Handicapped him from birth. As if he
wasn't handicapped enough. The eighteen-year-old had hair
like the Bride of Frankenstein's, a curved spine like the
Hunchback of Notre Dame's, a dragging foot like Igor's,
13
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
and a face like the Ugly Duchess's in the first Alice book.
Besides the hump, he had a monkey on his back. He was a
speed freak. Jim hoped that he had been caught before his
brain had been burned out.
Worst of all was his tendency to drool.
And he, Jim Grimson, had thought he was bom with two
strikes against him.
Jim pitied the poor guy, but he couldn't stand him.
Wouldn't you know it? Junior Wunier had chosen Kick-
aha as his role model. Kickaha, the handsome, strong,
quick, and ever-tricky hero. Whereas Jim would have
thought that Wunier would pick Theotormon. That charac-
ter was a Lord who had been captured by his father and
whose body had been cruelly transformed in the laboratory
into a monster with flippers and a hideous and bestial face.
Wunier went into the storeroom and brought out five
paperbacks for Jim. "Read 'em and weep," he said.
Jim put the stack of Farmer's novels under his arm. Were
they to be his salvation? Or were they like everything else,
full of promises that turned out to be hot air?
Wunier led Jim to his room through halls that were, at
this moment, empty. Everybody was in his own room, in
the recreation room, or in private or group therapy. The
long wide halls with their white walls and gray floors
echoed their footsteps. Jim had been assigned, for the time
being, to a one-person room, small and very hospital-
looking. The tiny closet was more than large enough,
however. The only clothes Jim had were on his back, and
these had been brought by his mother, who had gotten them
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (9 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

from Mrs. Wyzak. Being Sam's, they fit him too tightly.
The shoes were embarrassing, square-toed oxfords that Sam
would have worn only if his mother had threatened to kill
him if he didn't, which she probably had.
Junior Wunier pointed to a niche in the wall. "You can
74
put the books there. Now, here's the rules and regulations."
He leaned against the wall. Holding the paper with both
hands close to his face, he read it aloud. A spray of saliva
moistened the paper.
Jim thought, Suffering succotash! This guy was another
Sylvester the Cat.
He sat down in the only chair, a wooden one with a
removable cushion. He wished he had a cigarette. His teeth
ached slightly; his nerves were drawn as tightly as telephone
cables; his temper badly needed tempering.
Wunier droned on as if he were a Buddhist monk
chanting the Lotus Sutra. The patient had to keep his or her
room neat and orderly. The patient had to take a shower
every day, keep his nails clean, and so on. The patient could
use only the telephone by the officer of the day's desk and
must not tie it up for more than four minutes. Smoking was
permitted only in the lounge. Graffiti was forbidden. Those
patients caught with nonprescription drugs or booze or
tearing off a piece (Wunier's words) would be subject to
being kicked out on his or her ass.
"And when you jack off," he said, "don't do it in the
showers or in the presence of anyone else."
"How about before a mirror?" Jim said. "Is the image
another person?"
"From Sarcasmville," Wunier growled. "Just obey the
rules, and you'll get along fine."
Wunier dragged his foot across to the wall and tore off a
taped-up paper. Jim read the words on it before it went into
the wastebasket.
DON'T BE AFREUD OF YOUR SHRINK.
Beneath the phrase was a Kilroy-was-here drawing.
"There's some wise guy puts this stuff up in all the
rooms," Wunier said. "We call him the Scarlet Letterer. His
ass'll be scarlet if we catch him."

out of the Saturday Evening Post, the only thing hanging on
the wall was a calendar.
Jim said, "How about the mantras? A lot of the rooms
have them up on the walls."
"That's OK, part of the therapy. Some people need them
to get into the World of Tiers." Wunier paused, then said,
"You decided yet what character you'll choose?"
He obviously wanted to stay and talk. Poor guy must be
lonely. But Jim didn't feel like sacrificing himself for
someone who was the last person he wanted to talk with.
"No," Jim said. He was about to get up but then drew
back into the chair. He pointed at the space below his bed.
"What's that?"
Wunier's eyes widened. He started to bend over to look
under the bed, then changed his mind.
"What do you mean, 'What's that?'"
"It just moved. I thought it was just the shadows. But it's
very dark, blacker than outer space. It looks like if you put
your hand in it, the hand'd freeze off and float into the
fourth dimension. Sort of spindle-shaped. About a foot
long. Hey, it moved again!"
Wunier stared briefly at the bed and a longer time at Jim.
"I have to get going," he said. Attempting nonchalance,
he added, "I leave you to entertain your guest." But he got
out of the room as swiftly as he could.
Jim laughed loudly when he thought that Wunier would
not hear him. The thing he had claimed to see was out of a
novel by Philip Wylie—he didn't remember the title—but
he didn't know if Wunier had really thought there was one
under the bed or if he was scared that Jim was about to freak
out.
However, he was, a minute later, in a mixed black and
red mood. A sort of AC phase. Depression alternating with
16
RED ORC'S RAGE
anger. The psychologists said that depression was anger
turned against yourself. So, how could he, like a light
flashing off and on, suffer from both states within a
minute's time? Maybe he really was about to freak out.
IT'S DEPRESSING TO BE A MANIC.
He'd tape that to the rest-room wall. He'd show them that
the damned elusive Scarlet Letterer wasn't the only one who
could strike from the shadows.
He didn't even have clothes of his own. And he had no

money. Strip a man or woman of his possessions and
money, and you see a person who's lost his manhood or her
womanhood. That person was no longer a person. Not
unless he or she were a Hindu fakir or yogi, part of a culture
that considered such people to be holy. Not in this world
where clothes and money made the man, where the emperor
was the only one who could go naked and still be a person.
He had nothing.
While sitting in the chair, staring at nothing, a nothing
looking into a mirror, he felt the blackness recede. It was
followed by red, red that surged into every cell of his body
and mind.
But a man who was angry was a man who had something.
Rage was a positive force even if it led to negative action.
A poem he'd read a long time ago said—how'd it go?
couldn't remember it verbatim—rage would work if reason
wouldn't.
Gillman Sherwood, a fellow patient, stuck his head in the
doorway. "Hey, Grimson! Group therapy in ten minutes!"
Jim nodded and got up from the chair.
He knew then what character he was going to choose. To
be.
Red Ore. A villainous Lord in the series, Kickaha's most
dangerous enemy. One mean and angry Ess Oh Bee. He
kicked ass because his own was red.

CHAPTER 4
October 31, 1979, Halloween
JOMETHING HAD AWAKENED Jim just before the alarm clock
had gone off. His eyes still sleep-blurred, he had stared
upwards. The cracks in the ceiling were slowly forming a
map of chaos. Or were they preliminary strokes of a
drawing of the image of a beast or some cryptic symbol?
Several new cracks had shot out from the old ones since he
had gone to bed last night.
The alarm clock startled him. Twirrruuup! Up and Adam!
Rise from bed, sluggard! Roll 'em! Roll 'em! Once more to
the breach!
The early-morning sun shone through the thin yellow
curtains on white dust motes falling from the cracks.
The earth had moved below the house and shaken his
bed. Somewhere directly below him, one of the many
long-ago abandoned mine tunnels or shafts under Belmont
18
RED ORC'S RAGE
City had shifted or crumbled, and the Grimson house had

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
sunk or tilted a little more.
Three months ago, four blocks from Jim's house, two
houses, side by side, had fallen into a suddenly bom gap
two feet deep. They now leaned toward each other, their
front and back porches torn off. Once six feet apart, they
were jammed together, stuck in the hole like a couple of
too-large and too-hard suppositories in the Jolly Green
Giant.
A tremor a minute ago had yanked him upward, like a
trout on a hook, from a nightmare. But it was no dream of
a monster that had made him moan and whimper. It had
been a black-on-black dream in which nothing, nothing at
all, had happened.
He told himself to haul his weary ass out of bed and get
it in gear. "With a song in his heart." Yeah. A song like
"Gloomy Sunday." Only this was Wednesday, All Souls'
Day.
The room was very small. Seven big posters were taped
to the faded red-roses-and-light-green wallpaper and the
back of the door. The largest was that of Keith Moon, Moon
the Loon, great and late mad drummer for The Who. The
most colorful displayed the five members of the Hot Water
Eskimos, a local rock group. There was "Gizzy" Dillard
vomiting into his saxophone; Veronica "Singing Snatch"
Pappas shoving the microphone up under her leather mini-
skirt; Bob "Birdshot" Pellegrino jacking off one of his
drumsticks; Steve "Goathead" Larsen looking as if he were
humping his guitar; Sam "Windmill" Wyzak tickling the
ivories. Above the unsavory crew hovered a dozen cowbells
resembling UFOs in flight. Up close and in bright light, you
could see very thin wires connecting them to the ceiling.
Clad in torn green pajama tops, red pajama bottoms, and
black socks, he got out of bed and opened the door. Yes, it

did stick more than it had yesterday. Turning to the left, he
went down the unlit hall. Its carpet was thready and a dull
green. Inside the narrow bathroom, he turned on the light.
When he looked in the mirror, he winced. A third pimple
was bulging redly under the skin. His reddish whiskers were
sticking out a little more than they had yesterday. By
weekend, he would have to shave. The dull razors his father
insisted on keeping because new ones cost too much would
scrape his skin raw, cut off the scabs over the recently
squeezed pimples, and make them bleed.
He urinated into the washbowl. By doing this, Jim was
helping his father, Eric Grimson. Eric was always hollering
about too many flushes running up the utility bill. Jim was
also getting a small, if secret, revenge on that domestic
tyrant and all-around prick, his father.
While standing there, he studied his face. Those large
deep-blue eyes were inherited from both his Norwegian
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (13 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
father and his Hungarian mother. The reddish hair, long
jaw, and prominent chin were handed down from Eric
Grimson. The small ears, long straight nose, high cheek-
bones, and slightly Oriental cast of the eyes were the gifts
of his mother, Eva Nagy Grimson. His six feet and one and
a half inches of height came from his father. Jim would
grow three more inches if he became as tall as his begetter.
His old man was wiry and narrow-shouldered, but Jim had
gotten his broad shoulders from his mother's side of the
family. Her brothers were short but very wide and muscular.
God Almighty and then some! If he could get rid of the
damn pimples, he might be good-looking. He might even
get some place with Sheila Helsgets, the best-looking girl in
Belmont Central High, his unrequited love. Jim meant to
look up "unrequited" in the dictionary someday and find
out what it meant exactly. To Jim, it meant that his love was
20
RED ORC'S RAGE
one-sided, that she felt no more for him than an orbital
satellite did for the radar beam bouncing off it.
The only remark she had ever directed his way had been
to ask him to stand downwind of her. That had hurt him but
not enough to make him quit loving her. He had started
bathing twice a week, a big sacrifice of time on his part,
considering how little he had to spare for trivial matters.
Those pimples! Why did God, if He existed, curse
teenagers with them?
After splashing water on his face and penis and drying
them off with the towel only his father was supposed to use,
he headed for the kitchen. Despite the darkness of the
hallway, he could see white plaster dust on the carpet.
When he got to the kitchen, he noticed that new cracks were
in the greenish ceiling. There was white dust on the gas
stove and the oilcloth cover on the table.
"We're all going to fall into a hole," he muttered. "All
the way to China. Or Hell."
Hurriedly, he made his own breakfast. He swung open
the door of the forty-year-old refrigerator, the cooling coils
atop it looking like an ancient Martian watchtower. From it
he took a jar of mayonnaise, a Polish sausage, a Polish
pepper hot enough to burn the anus when it came out the
next day, half a browned banana, wilted lettuce, and cold
bread. He forgot to close the refrigerator door. While water
boiled for the cup of instant coffee he would make, he sliced
the sausage and banana and slapped together a sandwich.
He turned on the radio, purchased by his father's father
the day after the first transistor radios came on the market.
The vacuum-tube GE was gathering dust up in the overbur-
dened attic along with piles and piles of old newspapers and
magazines, broken toys, old clothes, cracked china, rusty
silverware, broomless brooms, and a burned-out 1942
Hoover vacuum cleaner.

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Eric and Eva Grimson found it painful to throw anything
away except garbage, and sometimes not even that. It was
as if, Jim thought, they were cutting off pieces of their own
bodies when they parted with a possession. Most people put
their past behind them. His parents put it above them.
He bit deeply into the sandwich and followed it with a
piece of Polish pepper. While his mouth burned and his eyes
watered, he turned the gas off and poured the boiling water
into a cup. As he stirred the instant coffee, WYEK,
Belmont's only rock station, blasted into the kitchen with
the tail end of the weather report. After that, it began to
blare out number sixteen of this week's local hit list. "Your
Hand's Not What I Want!" was the first song by the Hot
Water Eskimos that Jim had ever heard on the radio. It
would also be the last.
While he was bent over the sink and filling a glass with
cold water, he heard a growling which did not come from
the radio. Then the set went off. For two seconds, there was
no sound except that of running water. The growl behind
him came again.
"Goddamn! I told you and I told you! Keep that fucking
noise down! Or, by God, I'll throw the goddamn radio
through the window! And close the fucking refrigerator
door!"
The voice was low in volume but deep in tone. It was his
father's, his legal master's. The voice that had filled Jim
with dread and wonder when he was a child. It had not
seemed to be human. Jim still found it hard to believe that
it was.
Yet, he could remember moments when he had loved it,
when it had made him laugh. That was what confused his
attitude toward his father. But he was not mixed up now.
He straightened up, turned the faucet off, and drank from
the glass as he wheeled slowly around. Eric Grimson was
22
RED ORC'S RAGE
tall, red-faced, red-eyed, puffy-lidded, fat-jowled, and
big-paunched. The broken veins in his nose and cheeks
reminded Jim of the cracks in the ceilings.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
Another parent-child confrontation, as the school psy-
chologist called it. One more time locking homs with a
shithead, as Jim thought of it.
His old man sat down. He put his elbows on the table and
then his face between his hands. For a moment, he looked
as if he were going to cry. Then he straightened, his open
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (15 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
palms striking the tabletop loudly and making the sugar
bowl dance around. He glared. But his hands, when he lit a
match to a cigarette, were shaking.
"You turned it on loud on purpose, didn't you? You won't
let me sleep. God knows, you know, too, your mother
knows, I need it. But no, will you let me sleep? Why?
Goddamn nastiness, pure omeriness, the mean streak you
got from your mother, that's why! And I told you to close
the refrigerator door! You . . . you . . . snake! That's
what you are! A goddamn snake!"
He slammed his right hand against the table. The cloud of
stale beer issuing from his mouth made Jim wrinkle his
face.
"I won't put up with that crap from you anymore! By
God, I'm going to throw that goddamn radio through the
window! And you after that!"
"Go ahead!" Jim said. "See if I care!"
His father would not take him up on that dare. No matter
how furious Eric Grimson got, he would not destroy
anything that might cost him money to replace.
Eric rose from the chair. "Get out!" he yelled. "Out, out,
out! I don't want to see your fartface around here, you
long-haired freak-weirdo! Get out right now or I'll kick
your ass all the way to school! Now! Now! Now!"
23
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
His old man was trying to provoke him to hit him, Jim
thought. Then he could break a few bones in his son, bloody
his nose, slam him in the belly, kick him in the balls,
kidney-punch him.
Which was exactly what his son wanted to do to his old
man and was going to do some day.
"All right!" Jim screamed. "I'll go, you drunken bum,
hopeless welfare case, parasite, loafer, loser! And you can
shut the door yourself."
Eric's cement-mixer voice got lower but louder. His face
was red, and his mouth was wide open, showing crooked
tobacco-yellowed teeth. His eyes looked like blood clots.
"You don't talk to me like that, your father! You fucking
hippie, stinking . . . stinking ..."
"How about pink Commie bastard?" Jim said as he sidled
by his father, facing him, ready to strike back but trembling
violently.
"Yeah! That'll do fine!" his father roared.
But Jim was running down the hall. Just before he
entered his bedroom, he saw a door open at the far end of
the corridor. From the narrow rectangle between door and
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (16 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

wall came a flickering light and a strong odor of incense.
His mother's face appeared. As usual, she had been praying
and fingering her beads while kneeling before the statues in
the room. Then, hearing the uproar, instead of coming out
to defend her son, she had hidden behind the door until
peace and quiet came again or, at least, seemed about to
break out.
"Tell God to shove it!" Jim shouted.
His mother gasped. Her head disappeared, and her door
closed slowly and softly. That was his mother. Slow and
soft, quiet and peaceful. And no more effectual than the
shadow she resembled. She had lived so long among ghosts
that she had become one.
24
CHAPTER 5
JIM, NOW DRESSED and holding his school book bag in one
hand, leaped through the front doorway. Behind him,
standing in the doorway, shouting insults and threats, was
his father. He was not going to pursue his son outside his
territory, on which he felt safe. He was the cock of the walk
and the bull of the woods on his own land. Which, actually,
was the bank's, if you wanted to get technical about it.
Which, if the tunnels and shafts under the house kept
collapsing, might soon be Mother Earth's.
The sky was clear, and the sun promised to warm the air
up to around the low seventies. A great day for Halloween,
though the radio weather report had said that clouds were
supposed to appear later in the day.
That was the outside weather. Jim felt as if lightning was
banging around in him like an angry ogre cook throwing
pots and pans around. Black clouds were racing across his
personal sky. They bore news of worse to come.
25
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Eric Grimson kept on shouting though his son was now a
block down the street. A couple of people were sticking
their heads out their front doors to see what the commotion
was. Jim plunged ahead, swinging his bag, which held five
textbooks, none of which he had opened last night, pencils,
a ballpoint pen, and two notebooks the pages of which
mostly bore Jim's attempts to write lyrics. It also contained
three tattered and dirty paperbacks. Nova Express, Venus on
the Half-Shell, and Ancient Egypt.
His mother had not had time to fix his lunch for him.
Never mind. His stomach hurt like a fist gripping red-hot
barbed wire.
Too much too long.
When was he going to blow up in his own Big Bang?
It was coming, it was coming.

In a notebook was his latest lyric, "Glaciers and Novas."
Burn, burn, burn, burn!
Nothing tells how hot I am.
Words're shadows; fury's the substance.
Uncle Sam will blacken my fire.
Uncle Sam's a grinding glacier,
Five miles high, a-grinding
Mountains down to flatness.
Glacier wants everything flat,
Glacier wants to quench all fire.
Pop and Mom are ice giants
Coming to get me, cool my fire.
White house frost giant,
FBI trolls,
CIA ogres,
Werewolf Fuzz are circling me.
Jailhouse fridge'II freeze the fire.
Ahab chasing Moby Dick,
26
RED ORC'S RAGE
Chasing his own dick, it's said,
Ahab tearing the mask from God,
Bombshell heart about to explode,
His anger's a candle, mine's a klieg.
Eons on, ages on, eons on, eras on,
Old switchman Time reroutes the tracks,
Express-train Sun rams head-on
In destined doom the Nova Special,
Blows, explodes, incinerates all,
Splattering Pluto with pieces of Mars.
Glacier gives up my frozen corpse,
Glacier gives itself to fire.
Frozen corpse will burn again.
Righteous fire is never quenched.
Burn, burn, burn, burn!
That said it all, yet it was not enough.
That was why movies, paintings, and the beat of rock—
above all, the beat of rock—were sometimes better than
words. The unsayable was said. Better said, anyway.
For a moment, the street around him seemed to become
wavy. It was as shimmering and as unstable as a mirage in
a desert. Then it cooled off and became unmoving again.
Complanter Street was as solid as it had been a few seconds
ago. Just as squalid, too. Seven blocks away, above the
roofs of the houses, the gray-black smokestacks and upper
stories of the Helsgets Steel Works mills were metal giants.
Dead giants because no stinking and black smoke poured
from them. Jim remembered when they had been alive,
though that seemed so long ago that it might have been in
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (18 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

another century.
Cheap foreign steel had shut down the area's industrial-
steel complex. Since then, or so it seemed to Jim, his
parents' troubles and, thus, his own troubles, had started.
27
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Though the busy furnaces had poured clouds of dirt and
poison over the city, they had also showered prosperity.
Now, hand in hand with cleaner air had come poverty,
despair, rage, and violence. Though the citizens could now
see a house two blocks away, they could not see the future
and were not sure they wanted to.
This street, the whole city, was Bob Dylan's "Desolation
Row."
Jim shuffled along the cracked sidewalk in his dirty and
scarred cowhide boots. He passed two-story bungalows
built just after World War II ended. Some of the front yards
were fenced in; some of these fences were white with paint
and had been repaired not too long ago. Some of the yards
sported nice-looking lawns. Those with little grass or none
at all were occupied by old cars up on blocks or motorcycles
partly torn apart.
The morning sun was glorious in the unflecked blue sky.
Yet the light in Belmont City had seemed for a long time to
Jim to be unlike the light elsewhere. It was particularly
harsh and, at the same time, gritty. How could sunlight in
clear air be gritty? He did not know. It just was. He did not
know when it had first seemed so to him. He suspected that
it was about the time his pubic hair began to grow.
SPOING! There It was, the irrepressible It. SPOING! It
rose and swelled like an angry cobra at just about anything,
as long as that anything hinted of sex. Anything in movies,
photos, ads, you name it, unaccountable stray thoughts and
mental images—all called It up like a witch waving a magic
wand. SPOING! There It was, no matter how embarrassing.
That was when the sunlight in Belmont City had started
to be harsh and gritty.
Or was it?
Maybe it had begun when he had had his first "vision."
Or when his "stigmata" had first appeared.
28
RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim saw his best buddy, Sam "Windmill" Wyzak, a half
block away down Complanter Street. Sam was standing by
the white picket fence on his front yard. Jim stepped up his
pace. Only Jim's grandfather, Ragnar Grimsson, the Nor-
wegian sailor and locomotive engineer, and Sam Wyzak
really loved him. All three had souls like forks attuned to
the same pitch. But his grandfather had died five years ago
(maybe that was when the light got harsh and gritty) and
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (19 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

now only Jim and Sam vibrated on the same frequency.
Sam was six feet tall and very skinny. His sharp and
pointed face could have been a model for that of Wile E.
Coyote of the "Road Runner" cartoons. He looked just as
hungry and desperate, but his deep-brown and close-set
eyes lacked Wile E.'s never-quenched light of hope. His
glossy black hair was unruly and bushy, almost an Afro.
When Jim got closer, Sam called out, "Jimbo! My man!"
in a high-pitched and whiney voice. He danced a shuffle-
off-to-Buffalo while he sang the first six lines of a lyric of
Jim's. Jim thought it was good, but the Hot Water Eskimos
had rejected it as "not rock enough." Its first line was a
phrase used by Siberian Eskimo shamans when they worked
magic, words that organized chaotic lines of force into
powerful instruments for good or evil.
The song in its entirety went thus:
ATA MATUMA M'MATA!
You in trouble, deep in crap?
Hire the ancient Siberian shaman.
Wizard magic guaranteed to work.
Shaman chants a Stone Age spell:
ATA MATUMA M'MATA!
Gather all these witchy items!
You don't get these at Neiman Marcus!
Angel's feather, Dracula's breath,

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Polar bear's malaria,
Politician's unbroken promise,
Scream from Captain Hook's toilet stall,
Earwaxfrom Spock of far-off Vulcan,
Nielsen rating of Tinker Bell,
Turnip blood—Rh-negative,
Jack the Ripper's love for women,
Needle's eye which traps the rich,

"The 'Ata Matuma M'Mata' spell won't work, Sam,"
Jim said. "I'm down, way down. I'm also pissed, really got
the red-ass."
Mrs. Wyzak was looking out a window at him. She was
big and had Mother Earth breasts and was a mighty big
mother herself. She was, unlike his mother, the powerhouse
in the family. Mr. Wyzak was no wimp, but he was his
wife's shadow. When she moved, he moved. When she
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (20 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

spoke, he nodded his head.
Mrs. Wyzak had a peculiar expression. Was she wishing
that Jim was also her son? She had wanted at least six kids,
a brood, a pulsation of progeny. But she had had a
hysterectomy after Sam, her firstborn. Mr. Wyzak, in his
less charitable moments, and he had many, said that Sam
had poisoned her womb.
Or was her face set so oddly because she thought that
Sam's friend was so odd? A boy who had had such strange
30
RED ORC'S RAGE
visions and who suffered from stigmata was not your
normal playmate for your child.
Jim's mother . . . that was a different case. She had
thought at first that Jim was a latter-day St. Francis because
of the unearthly things he had seen and his unexplainable
bleedings. But when Jim got older she had put aside her
dreams of sainthood for him. Now she was not so sure she
had not mated with the devil when she was sleeping and Jim
was their child. She had never said so, though Jim's father
had. But Jim believed that his father was repeating what she
had told him. However, his father could have made it up.
He did not put in full time hurting his son, but that was only
because he had other things to do. Like getting drunk and
gambling.
Jim waved at Mrs. Wyzak. She stepped back as if
startled, then moved to the window again and waved at him.
Since she was not afraid of anyone—he wished to God that
his mother was like her—she must have been thinking
something bad about him. For a moment, she had been
ashamed. Or was he, he thought, too damn sensitive and
self-centered? That was what his father and his school
counselor had told him.
Jim and Sam walked away. Sam shook his head, and his
near-Afro waved like the plume on the helmet of a Trojan
warrior.
"Well?" Sam whined in Jim's ear.
"Well, what?"
"Jesus, you said you were down, way down, and we've
walked a whole block, and you ain't said a word! Down
about what? Same old story? You and your old man?"
"Yeah," Jim said. "Sorry. I was thinking, lost in my
thoughts. One of these days I'm going to lose my way and
never come back. And why should I? Anyway, here's my
sordid and sad tale."
31
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Sam listened, interjecting only a grunt or a "Weird, man!
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (21 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:31 PM]

Weird!" When Jim was finished, Sam said, "Ain't it the
shits? What can you do now? Nothing—according to The
Man. But it won't be long 'til you're eighteen, and you can
tell your old man to go fuck himself."
"If we don't kill each other first."
"Yeah. Th-th-that's all. f-f-folks! Period. No Continued
Next Chapter. You're pissed off? Listen, me and Mom got
into it this morning, about some of the same things you and
your Dad argued about. But, you know, with Mom it's
always the music.
" 'I worked my ass off,' she says, 'so you could take
music lessons, and now you can play the piano and the
guitar. But I didn't work myself to a frazzle as a grocery
clerk and a baby-sitter and God knows how many other jobs
and pinch my pennies so you could be a rock musician. And
now you want to dress up like a punk, look like some
drunken murdering redskin, embarrass me and your father
and my friends and Father Kochanowski! The saints help
me, the Virgin Mary help me! I wanted you to be a classical
musician, play Chopin and Mozart, be somebody I could be
proud of! Look at you!' And so on. Same old shit.
"Then I said what I should've never said, but I was
seeing purple by then."
Sam rotated both arms several times, the lunch bag in one
hand. "Windmill" Wyzak was really going into action.
" 'Worked your ass off?' I said. 'What do you call that?
A camel?' I pointed at her big ass. God forgive me, I do
love my mother even if she's mostly a pain. Anyway, I had
to run for my life. Mom threw dishes at me and took after
me with a broom. I had to run through the house and then
into the backyard with her screaming at me and the old man
laughing like crazy, rolling on the floor, glad to see
somebody besides him being picked on by her."

RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim was hurt by Sam's seeming not to care about his
troubles with his father. Jim was open, panting and slaver-
ing, for sympathy and understanding and advice. So what
was his supposed best friend doing? Ignoring his friend's
absolutely pressing crises to talk about his own problems,
which Jim had heard too many times.
33
CHAPTER 6
I HEY TURNED OFF Complanter Street onto Pitts Avenue,
which led straight for six blocks to Belmont City Central
High School. Cars loaded with students sped by them. No
one in the vehicles waved or shouted at the two pedestrians,
though all knew them. Jim felt like an outcast, a leper
whose only skin disease was acne. That made his mood
blacker, his anger redder.

Jesus H. Christ! Those uppity snobs didn't have any right
to look down on him because his father was out of work and
the Grimson family was pisspot poor and lived in a
run-down low-class blue-collar area. The students who had
their own cars were not so rich themselves, except for
Sheila Helsgets, and her family wasn't doing so well either.
The closing of the steel mills had socked it to her father. He
probably wasn't now worth more than a million or so, and
that would be mostly just property and low-value stocks and
bonds. At least, that's what he had heard about the
Helsgetss'.
34
RED ORC'S RAGE
Sam had no idea how madly and badly in love with her
Jim was. Jim held some things back from his old buddy
because he didn't want to be laughed at. Like his passion for
Sheila Helsgets and his writing "straight" poetry at the
same time he was writing rock lyrics and reading many
books and his vocabulary, which was much larger than
Sam's and that of the other guys he hung around with
though he wasn't always sure of the precise meaning of the
words he used.
". . .a cigarette?" Sam said.
Jim said, "What?"
"Christamighty!" Sam said. "Get with it! Where are
you? Lost in space? Beam me back to Earth, Scotty. I asked
if you want a coffin nail."
Sam was holding in a dark hand, the fingernails dirty,
two nonfilter Camels. Jim should have been grateful for the
offer; he was so short of money he couldn't buy a pack. But,
for some reason, he did not want to smoke.
"Nah! How about an upper?"
Sam slipped a Camel into the right comer of his lips, put
the other in the pocket of his black shirt, and dipped his
hand into the outside pocket of his blue jacket. It came out
with three capsules.
"Yeah. Black beauties. Guaranteed to give you a balloon
ride to the moon. But watch out for the landing."
"Thanks," Jim said. "I'll take one. I'll have to owe you."
"That's seven dollars you owe," Sam said. He quickly
added, "Just keeping the books up to date. No hurry. Your
credit's always good with me, you know. I ain't billing you
for the cigarettes I been giving you, either. I know when
you get them, you'll help me in my distress. Like you
always say, we're Damon and Pithy-ass, whoever they
might be."
Jim popped one upper into his mouth and swallowed it

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
dry. He worked his mouth to generate saliva to help it on
down.
The Biphetamine worked far faster then usual. Zap!
Where there had been tired blood, as the ads said, was now
a river of molten gold. Coursing through his veins, not to
mention his arteries, each molecule racing the others to get
back to his heart first and then back to the merry-go-round
for another race at breakneck speed. The harsh and gritty
light melted into a soft smoothness.
Sam had put a black beauty into his mouth before
stopping to cup his hand and then flicking the Bic. He drew
in deeply and blew out smoke as he resumed walking. Jim,
waiting for him, looked around as if he had never seen this
place before. He could see the top of Belmont Central over
the scrungy houses (Pitts Avenue was the pits). Beyond
that, to the northeast, was the two-story building of earth-
colored brick and Tuscan columns, Wellington Hospital. To
the southwest was the spire of St. Stephan's, smack in the
Hungarian neighborhood. His mother bypassed St. Grobi-
an's, the Irish church, to attend St. Stephan's even though
she had to walk an extra mile.
Looking north again, Jim could see the dome of City
Hall. Lots of action there, most of it dirty, if what Sam
Wyzak's drunken uncle, a judge, said was true.
And straight north went Pitts Avenue, ending at the foot
of Gold Hill. Up above, so high in the sky, were the homes
of the kings and queens of Belmont City. While they sipped
their martinis and counted their money, they could look
down on the rabble, the proletariat, the salt of the earth,
those who would inherit, not trust funds but the earth, that
is, the dirt itself.
What made Jim's father especially angry about Gold Hill
people was that his wife worked there. Her job was only
part-time, and the wealthy did not pay much (the tight-assed
36
RED ORC'S RAGE
skinflints!), but the money was better than none. Eva Nagy
Grimson was employed by a small company to houseclean
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Eric's unemploy-
ment checks had long ceased to come in. Reluctantly, Eric
had applied for and gotten welfare. He was of a generation
that regarded welfare as shameful. He also believed that a
wife should not work. The husband was humiliated if she
did. He was a failure as a man and a provider.
Jim could understand why his father writhed with shame
and despair and frustration. But why did he have to take it
out on his wife and son? Did he think they liked the mess
they were in? Were they responsible for the bad things in
their lives?
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (24 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Why did his father spend the precious money his wife
made on booze? Why didn't he just up and pull anchor,
leave the doomed house behind, take his family to Califor-
nia or some place where he could get a job? However, if he
did that, he was up against his wife. She went along with
everything he did, no matter how rotten it was, never
complained or argued. Except once. When he had sug-
gested leaving Belmont City, she had told him firmly that
she would not obey him. She would not move away from
the Nagy clan and their friends.
"Jesus Christ!" Eric had shouted. "If you got a Hungar-
ian for a friend, you don't need an enemy!"
Jim and Sam were now two blocks from Central High, a
huge old three-story redbrick building. At least, Jim
thought, my body is two blocks from it. My mind, Jesus,
where's my mind? All over the place. I got to get with it.
The day you were living in was the present. But the past
was often with you, poking a sharp-nailed finger in the
tissue of your brain and gouging out a piece, then pressing
on a nerve to remind you that the bottom line of life was
pain, then groping around other parts, feeling your dick,
37
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
giving you a proctological examination, thumping your
heart's naked flesh to make it beat like a hummingbird's
wings, tying your intestines into a running sheepshank knot,
vomiting hot acid into your stomach, whipping up night-
mares with the blender of old Morpheus, ancient Greek god
of sleep.
A title for a lyric. "The Dead Hand of the Past." Nah. A
cliche, though that never stopped most rock lyricists.
Anyway, the past was not a dead hand. You carried it with
you like it was a living thing, a tapeworm. Or like
Heinlein's parasitic slug from Titan, the ice-moon of Sat-
urn, the slug growing tendrils in your back and sucking the
life and brains out of you. Or like a fever no pills could cool
down until you were cold-dead, and you didn't need pills
then.
". . . trying to get a gig tonight, no soap," Sam was
saying. "Got one Saturday night at me Whistledick Tavern
out on Moonshine Ridge, but that's redneck territory, and
we gotta play that godawful country-western. We might
cancel. Anyway, we couldn't get one tonight, and my cup
runneth over. Halloween's for fun. Remember how we
pushed over old man Dumski's outhouse when we was
fifteen? Maybe it was when we was fourteen. Anyway,
remember how Dumski came out of his house screaming
and shooting his shotgun? Man, did we run!"
"Sounds good," Jim said. "I'll call work and tell them
I'm sick. I'll probably get fired, but what the hell."

CHAPTER 7
JUST BEFORE HE and Sam joined the gang, Sam slipped him
a stick of chewing gum. "Take it. You got a breath v/ould
knock down King Kong."
"Thanks," Jim said. "Must be the Polish sausage, too
much garlic. Anyway, my stomach's upset."
Three guys were waiting for them. Hakeem "Gizzy"
Dillard, a short chunky black suffering from yellow jaun-
dice. Bob "Birdshot" Pellegrino, a big youth with a huge
black walrus moustache and one glass eye. Steve "Goat-
head" Larsen. They gave each other five fingers, Jim
noticing that the greeting only seemed a hundred percent
natural when Gizzy did it. Goathead brought out a mari-
juana butt from which each took a puff while keeping an eye
on the big front entrance for an appearance of Central's
principal, Jesse "Iron Pants" Bozeman, or one of his
teacher snitches.
"Hey, man, you hear about what Kiss did in that hotel
room in Peoria?"
39
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"I got an upper trade you for a downer."
"... said Mick Jagger caught the clap from the may-
or's wife ..."
"The old man said, 'You get a Mohawk, I cut off your
balls.'"
"... think Lum'll spring a surprise exam today?"
"... and I thought. You can drive the point of that
I-saw-Cele's triangle all the way up your ass. Define it, shit,
I can't even pronounce it. But I was cool. So, I told Mister
Slowacki, geometry ain't my fortay. That's for Republi-
cans, and my folks always vote straight Democrat."
"... sent to Iron Pants's office again. But he wasn't
there. Probably balling his secretary in the xerox room."
". . . so he says, 'I knew you was long, and I knew you
was black, but where did you get them googly eyes?'"
"Man, I swear you wasn't my asshole buddy, I don't take
those racist jokes. Lemme tell you about the white
woman—a mouse ran up her snatch so she go see this black
doctor. And he say ..."
Chattering fast, seeming to talk out of both sides of their
mouths at the same time, giggling, butt-slapping, shadow-
boxing, the group danced into the front hall. Jim was silent,
his only responses a grunt or a forced grin. The black beauty
wasn't working the way it was supposed to. The guy who'd
sold it to Sam must've cheated him. Probably had just a
little Biphetamine in it. The rest of it was ground-up aspirin
or something.

While on his way to his locker, he saw Sheila Helsgets
leaning against the wall. She was talking to and smiling at
Robert "Ram-'Em" Basing, a very big and very good-
looking blond who was Central's foremost tackle and
captain of the football and the rhetoric teams. A six-letter
man. Lots of money, drove a Mercedes-Benz, and lived on
Gold Hill. An A-minus average. A clear and tanned
RED ORC'S RAGE
complexion. Naturally, he was pinned to Sheila, probably
in more ways than one, Jim thought. But reliable reports
said he was cheating on her. He'd even been seen in a
nightclub in the nearby city of Warren with Angie "Blow-
Job" Calorick.
Seeing him pat the egg-shaped cheek of Sheila's ass made
Jim want to puke.
He slammed his locker door shut with a big bang. Sheila
looked away from Basing and at him. She quit smiling.
Then she turned her head back to The Winner. She smiled
again.
Sheila baby, you think he's Jesus H. Christ Himself! I'd
like to crucify him, preferably with rusty nails that wouldn't
be hammered through only his hands and feet. Wouldn't
make any difference, though. She'd still look at me like I
was a leper. "Unclean! Unclean!"
Jim sang softly to himself as he trudged down the hall
toward Biology 201. It was his own creation, tided "Here's
Looking Up at You."
Scruff me, scurve me,
Deck me out with pimples and fleas.
Feed me beans, then bitch about
Gas a-boiling in your face.
Step on me, and call me flat.
Squeeze me dry, and call me husk.
Say I got no class at all!
Trip-hammer sky's ramming me down,
Knocking the dandruff off my head,
Thumpa-thumpa-thumping me,
Drilling rock and liquid iron.
Earthworms, moles, and buried bones,
God, the Devil, Mrs. Grundy,
Who's not looking down at me
PHILIP JOSE FARMER RED ORC'S RAGE
Spinning in the core of Earth?
Any way from here is up.
Can't believe that's not a lie.
Every way looks down to me.
Raunch me, sleaze me,
Rip my soul with taloned scorn.

Call me ragged, light a candle,
Say for me a ragged mass.
Scruff me, scurve me,
Deck me out with pimples and fleas.
He followed Bob and Sam into the big classroom and
took a chair in the rear row comer with the other losers.
There was the usual loud talk, poking fun at each other,
sailing paper airplanes, and throwing spitballs. Then silence
and rigidity came down like a guillotine blade as the aged
but not venerable Mister Lewis "Holy Roller" Hunks
walked in. Grim and crusty and obnoxiously religious
described Mister Hunks. Add to that that he was a creation-
ist who was forced by law to teach evolution, though it was
called "development," and you had one frustrated and
miserable white-haired old man.
Hunks checked off the students present and absent as if he
were taking the roll call on the Day of Judgment. After
pronouncing each name, he looked up from behind very
thick glasses. He grimaced when he spoke the name of a
student he did not like, and he smiled thinly when he uttered
the name of a student who was not going to Flunkers' Hell.
He smiled three times.
Having designated a favorite student to carry a list of the
absent to the principal's office. Hunks launched into today's
lecture. It continued the previous lecture, which was on the
reproductive system of the frog. Jim tried to listen intently
and to take notes because the subject was interesting. But
42
his stomach hurt, and he had a headache. To make condi-
tions worse. Hunks managed to combine droning with a
squeaky voice. Jim felt like he was on an oxcart with an
unlubricated wheel going across a flat and treeless plain.
The view was putting him to sleep, but the wheel was
keeping him awake.
Sam Wyzak, who was sitting by Jim, leaned over and
whispered, "I'm going to fall asleep. Whyn't you tell him
he's full of shit? At least we won't be bored to death."
"Why don't you tell him?" Jim whispered back.
"Hell, I don't know nothing about this and couldn't care
less. You're the expert. You start the fireworks. Old Sam
just wanta make things jump. Geeve eet to heem!"
A silence in the room alerted Jim. He straightened up and
looked at Mister Hunks. The old guy was glaring at him,
and the students had turned their heads to look at him and
Sam. Jim's heart felt like a squirrel thrown into a wheel-
cage. It began running just to stay in one place. The thuds
of its feet against metal were also drum signals. "Man, you
done it now!"
"Well, Mister Grimson, Mister Wyzak," Hunks
squeaked. "Would you mind sharing with us your private
thoughts about the subject at hand?"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (28 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Jim said, "It was nothing."
His own voice was squeaky. He was angry because he
had been caught, and he was angry with himself because he
was afraid to speak out against Hunks. The old man would
make a fool of him for sure.
"Nothing, Mister Grimson? Nothing? You two were
disturbing me and the class because you were just making
nonsensical noises? Or perhaps you were imitating the apes
you claim you're descended from? Were you imitating ape
calls, you two?"
Jim's heart beat even harder, and his stomach swung back
43
PHILIP JOSE FARMER                                               RED ORC'S RAGE
and forth, sloshing acid from one end to the other. But,
trying to look cool, he stood up. He also was trying to keep
his voice steady.
"Well," he said. He paused to clear his suddenly
phlegmed throat. "No, we weren't imitating ape language.
We . . ."
"Ape language?" Hunks said. "Apes don't have a lan-
guage!"
"Well, I mean ... ape signals, whatever."
Sam whispered, "Umgawa!" He writhed with silent
laughter.
"When your fellow simian recovers from his fit, you may
continue," Hunks said. He squinted through his thick
glasses as if they were a telescope and he, the astronomer,
had just discovered some worthless asteroid that had no
business being where it was.
Sam quit moving, but he was biting his lips to keep from
exploding with laughter.
"Uh," Jim said, and he cleared his throat again. "Uh, I
had some thoughts on what you just said, uh, that about life
developing, no, I mean originating, in the primal soup, and
its, uh, statical, I mean, statistical improbability. But I got
to think more about that before I say anything.
"What I was thinking was about something you said last
week. Remember? You, we, talked about why, for exam-
ple, uh, dog embryos and human embryos were so similar.
In the early stages of their development, anyway. You
explained why human embryos have tails, that is, according
to the theory of development. You evidently didn't believe
that theory. Then you tried to explain why, uh, if the
Creator made all creatures in just a couple of
days . . . you said, you tried to explain why all male
mammals have nipples even though they don't need them,
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (29 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
why, uh, flightless insects have wings."
44
His throat felt dry. Hunks's grin was mean, mean, mean.
The students were watching him. Some had tittered when he
mentioned nipples.
"Also, why do snakes have rudimental . . . rudimen-
tary . . . limbs when they never need them any more than
males need nipples and insects that can't fly need wings? They
wouldn't have nipples, limbs, and wings if they were created
in a single day. You said that the wings, nipples, and limbs
were created for the sake of symmetry. The Creator was an
artist, and It had to make Its creatures symmetrical."
Jim referred to the Creator as It because it bugged Hunks.
Now his voice was stronger and deeper, and he was
speaking without the awkward hesitations. He was on a roll.
Devil take the consequences.
"That 'symmetry' explanation, if you'll pardon me,
Mister Hunks, doesn't ring true. It doesn't seem to be
logical. Anyway, I was thinking about it. Here's what I'd
like you to explain to me, sir. If the Creator was so keen on
'symmetry,' why, on the day of Creation, didn't It make
males who also had female genitals and vice versa? Why
don't us men have vaginas, too, and why don't women have
penises?"
Laughter from the students. Explosion from Mister
Hunks.
"Shut up and sit down!"
"But, sir!"
"I said shut up and sit down!"
Jim should have been happy because he had triumphed.
But he was shaking with rage. Hunks was just like his
father. When he had lost in a battle of words, he refused to
listen any more, and he evoked the gag law that adults used
against children. It was unappealable to a higher court
because Hunks was also that court.
Fortunately, the end-of-the-class bell rang just then.
45
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Hunks looked as if he was going to have a stroke, but he did
not tell Jim to see him in his office that afternoon. Jim felt
as if his own blood vessels were going to erupt. However,
a few seconds later, as he walked down the hall, he began
to feel exultance mixing with the rage. He had really given
it to the old fart, the living fossil, the Ku Klux Klanner of
Kristians.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (30 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Bob Pellegrino and Sam Wyzak were walking with him
through the crowd of students. Bob said, "It don't matter if
you win every argument with that dirty old man. He's gonna
flunk your ass."
Jim understood the description of Hunks. To the young,
anybody over sixty was dirty. No matter how physically
clean the old were in actuality, they were dirty because they
were close to death. Old Man Death was the ultimate in
filthiness, and anybody in his neighborhood was deeply
soiled.
There was also something that Jim could not know then
and would not know until much later. That was that Hunks
was much closer to the truth than the evolutionists.
46
CHAPTER 8
LUNCH HOUR CAME. Jim had no money to buy food, and his
anger had subsided enough for him to feel very hungry. Sam
Wyzak split his lunch with him, and Bob Pellegrino gave
him half a tuna fish sandwich and half a pickle. Jim cooled
off even more during Mister Lum's course in Advanced
English and Composition. This was the only subject in
which he had a B average. Well, pretty close to a B. A few
A's on the compositions he was going to write, and he
would get a B average. But if Jim didn't ever master the
difference between a dangling participle and a dangling
particle, he wouldn't pass the course.
"Knowing that won't help you become a better writer,
and you'll never use that item of academic knowledge," he
had said. "However, it's not so hard to understand, and
you're not a moron, no matter what your other teachers say.
I'm not going to pass you until knowledge of the difference
is embedded in your bones. Now, I'm not current with the
47
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
latest discoveries in physics. What the hell is a dangling
particle?"
After biology class, Jim and Sam headed for the rest
room. They went past the elderly guard outside the room
and entered. The place was busy, noisy, and stinking.
There, leaning against the wall by the washbowls were
Freehoffer, "The Blob," and his buddies, Dolkin and
Skarga. They were passing around a roach as if they didn't
give a damn if the guard caught them, and they didn't.
Freehoffer was huge, six feet four, close to three hundred
pounds, double-chinned, balloon-bellied, pig-nosed, and

hair. Egg yolk stained his red-and-black striped shirt.
Dolkin and Skarga were both short but very wide, and
their yellow-brown hair looked like viper nests.
Freehoffer and his buddies would have been shaking
down his victims, mostly scared freshmen or nerds, if the
room hadn't been so crowded. Jim had been forced to give
them money at least a dozen times during his four years at
Central. But this year he had never been caught alone in the
rest room by them, and the last time he had coughed up his
change for them, he had told Freehoffer, "Never again!"
Having eased themselves at the urinals, Jim and Sam
started to leave the room. Freehoffer stuck a foot out and
tripped Jim, who fell forward and banged his head against
the exit door. The pain was a hammer blow on a detonator.
Jim yelped and, cursing, straightened up, turned around,
and swung with his right fist. He did not think about what
he was doing; he was scarcely aware that he was doing it.
His fist sank into the big belly. Freehoffer's laughter became
a deep grunt, and he doubled over.
A surfer of rage carried on by a red wave, Jim brought his
knee up against The Blob's chin. The Blob fell on the tiled
RED ORC'S RAGE
floor, but he got up on all fours. Jim snarled, "Don't ever
touch me again, Pus-Face!"
Sam said, "Let's get going, Jim!"
Freehoffer got to his feet. "You won't get away with this,
shithead!"
Dolkin and Skarga started to move in. Sam tugged on
Jim's arm. "For Christ's sake, let's get outa here!"
"This ain't the place!" Freehoffer bellowed. "But if
you're a real man, Grimson, you'll meet me back of Pravit's
after school's over! You won't get no chance to hit me when
I ain't looking! I'll beat you to a bloody pulp if you got the
guts to stand up to me, and I don't think you got 'em!"
Jim started to shake, but he said, "Pair fight? Man to
man? Fists only?"
"Yeah! Fair fight! Fists only! I don't need nothing except
my fists to stretch you out, you spindly little fruitcake!"
"I don't like to dirty my hands on you, but I'll do it, you
heap of shit," Jim said. With Sam behind him, he swag-
gered out of the rest room.
"Jesus Christ, man!" Sam said. "What got into you?"
"I just won't take any more of his shit!"
"You must be mad at everybody and everything," Sam
said. "You ain't thinking straight. You know he ain't going
to fight fair, and Dolkin and Skarga'll be there to jump on

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
you, too."
"What'd you do if you were in my place?" Jim snarled.
"Me? I wouldn't show, no way. I'm not crazy!"
"You gonna be there, or you gonna let me take them on
by myself?"
"Oh, I'll be there," Sam said. "I won't let you down, old
buddy. But I better tell Bob and the others about this. The
more the better. You'll need backup. I'll bring a brick, too.
But this is crazy!"
By the time that school was out, the entire student body
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
seemed to know about the scheduled fight. Jim was still
mad but not so much that he was not also scared. Sam's
advice to stand The Blob up instead of standing up to him
was making more sense. But he was not going to back out
now. Everybody would think he had a yellow streak down
his back.
Pravit's Confectionery and Drugstore was a block away
from the high school. Trailed and preceded by students, Jim
went down the alley along the side of the store and then
went a few paces along the alley behind the old redbrick
building. With him were Wyzak, Pellegrino, and Larsen.
Jim had hoped that Freehoffer would be a no-show. No.
There was The Blob, leaning against the wall near the back
door, a toothpick in his blubber lips, seeming most noncha-
lant. By his side stood Dolkin and Skarga.
"There's the rest-room mugger, the bully of the crapper!"
Jim called out. His voice started out loud and firm enough,
but it cracked near the end of his sentence. He stopped a
dozen feet from Freehoffer while the crowd shifted around
to form a semicircle. Jim's three cronies stood just behind
him.
The Blob sneered. He said, "Sticks and stones, big
mouth." He continued to lean against the wall.
Jim dropped his book bag, screamed, and ran forward.
Freehoffer straightened up, his eyes wide. Jim ran and then
launched himself. He had seen karate fighting in many
movies but had never practiced any. This was a first-time,
all-or-nothing effort, do or die. His body came close to
leveling out as he slammed the bottom of his shoe into
Freehoffer's nose. He had tried for the chin, but his aim was
off. Not so bad, though. The Blob's head snapped back, and
he staggered against the wall. Blood gushed from his
nostrils.

Then Jim fell straight backward, tried to twist, but fell
50
RED ORC'S RAGE
heavily on his side. Pain shot through his shoulder. The
wind was knocked out of him. Despite this, he was up on
his feet and charged Freehoffer with his head down. He
drove it into the big belly. More pain lanced through him,
but down his neck this time.
Freehoffer gasped. Blood ran down his face, and he bent
over, clutching his belly. The attack had caught both him
and his buddies by surprise. Dolkin and Skarga, however,
unfroze and jumped on Jim, who still had not gotten his
wind back. Sam Wyzak, though fight-shy, did not hold
back once he got into a battle. He brought out from under
his jacket a brick. He slammed it against the side of
Dolkin's head. Dolkin went down onto his knees, a hand
clamped to the injured part. Skarga brought his fist out of
the pocket of his jacket. Brass knuckles gleamed as he
pulled his arm back to drive them into Jim's ribs. Bob
Pellegrino stepped in and slammed a fist against the side of
Skarga's jaw. Sam hit Skarga on his shoulder with the brick.
Skarga went down, yelling with pain, then tried to crawl
away into the crowd. Pellegrino kicked him hard in the butt.
Steve Larsen jumped on Skarga and bore him all the way to
the ground.
The Blob had a lot of flesh to absorb the damage done to
him. He was far from being out of the fight. Bellowing, he
lunged forward, drove into Jim, locked his arms around
him, and carried him down to the hard black pavement.
Since Jim had his arms free, he was able to strike Freehoffer
as they rolled around, though not effectively. When The
Blob bit him in his stomach, Jim cried out, but the pain gave
him strength to tear himself loose. He was still on his back
when Freehoffer rose to his feet and drew a foot back to kick
Jim.
Jim kicked first. His foot slammed into The Blob's
crotch. Yelling, holding his testicles, Freehoffer fell for-

ward. Before he hit the ground, he gushed yellow vomit.
Jim rolled away and escaped the crushing weight of the near
three hundred pounds. But the puke showered his hair and
the left side of his face and body.
He got to his feet. Then the stench and the feel of the stuff
sticking to him and the thought that it came from The Blob's
belly made him retch. Bent over Freehoffer, he sprayed him
in the face with his own vomit.
Some of the spectators were delighted. Others got nau-
seated, and a small number of these threw up. Their
example caused more to puke. But neither the enjoyers nor
the leathers had much time to express their reactions.

Nearby sirens announced the coming of the cops. Most of
the crowd hurriedly left the scene.
CHAPTER 9
52
/\s A BLACK-AND-WHITE squad car pulled into the alley,
Freehoffer croaked out his threats between sobs and long-
drawn-in breaths.
"I'm going to get you! I'll use the old man's shotgun,
Piss-Face! I'll blow out your crazy queer brains, then I'll
jam the Polack's brick up his ass before I blow off his head,
too!"
Dolkin and Skarga had fled. Bob Pellegrino and Steve
Larsen had reluctantly left after Jim had told them it made
no sense for them to stay to face the music. Sam, however,
had refused to desert Jim.
"Bullshit!" Jim said. He was breathless, too, though not
nearly as much as Freehoffer. "You've had it, puke-face!
Your reign of terror is over! Anytime I see you extorting
money from some scared kid, I'm going to jump you, right
then and there! I'll beat the piss out of you!"
He was shaking so much that his muscles seemed to be

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
trying to tear themselves loose from his bones. Yet he still
felt as if he were riding a gigantic surf wave. It was lifting
him up and up, and when he reached the crest, he would
soar off into the wild blue yonder. The fight had spurted out
much of the rage and the urge to do violence that had
possessed him all day.
The cops came then, strolling up slowly, looking around
but grinning. They were relieved that they did not have to
handle a riot. Jim thought that whoever had reported the
fight had exaggerated. Old man Pravit? Maybe. In any case,
the police department was understaffed and overworked,
like every other department in money-poor Belmont City. It
was a wonder that any police car had shown up.
It was good that Sam had not gone with the others. The
cops recognized his name. One of them knew that Sam was
the nephew of Stanislaw Wyzak, a night court judge, and of
John Krasinski, an alderman. The two patrolmen treated the
whole incident as just a heated argument among high school
kids.
Normally, the cops would have spread-eagled them
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (35 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

against the wall and frisked them. But they did not want to
get the stinking mess on their hands or, indeed, come any
closer to Grimson and Freehoffer than they had to. Nor
could they get out of the youths the true story of what had
caused the brouhaha. Jim refrained from telling them about
Freehoffer's extortions and his threats to kill him and Sam.
The Blob evidently wanted to accuse Jim of all sorts of
things, but he, too, abided by the unwritten law: Don't tell
the fuzz nothing about nobody. Though the cops knew that
they were being lied to, they did not care. If they let the
three go with a warning, they would avoid paperwork and
getting in Dutch with Judge Wyzak and Alderman Krasin-
ski. However, they added, this incident would have to be
reported to the boys' parents.
54
In effect: Go, children, and sin no more. And for Christ's
sake wash your clothes and take a bath. Haw! haw!
Just before the cops left, one of them scowled and said,
"Grimson? Where've I heard . . . oh, yeah ... I think
I hauled your old man in one night on a drunk and
disorderly. But there's something else. Oh, yeah! Didn't I
read a couple of years ago about you? Something to do with
some strange visions and you bleeding in your palms and
forehead. It made quite a to-do, didn't it? Some people
thought maybe you was a saint, and others thought you was
touched in the head."
"That was years ago. I was just a kid then," Jim said
sourly. "Everything's cleared up since then. Anyway, it
didn't mean much. The paper exaggerated. Anything to get
news."
He had a flash of the doctor who'd examined him after
the stigmata came. Old Doc Goodbone, belieye that name
or not. "It's just his overactive imagination coupled with a
tendency to hysteria," the physician had told his mother.
"The weird things he saw, the stigmata, they're explain-
able, and not by the introduction of supernatural elements.
Not common, these cases, but there have been many such
reported in medical journals. It's all psychological. The
mind can do strange things. Even the bleeding, which
seems purely physical, can be produced by the mind.
Especially by the minds of children and adolescents and
hysterical women. Little Jim will probably get over this, be
quite normal. We'll just have to keep an eye on him. Don't
worry."
His mother should have been relieved and probably was.
But she was also disappointed. She had been convinced that
the visions and the stigmata were God's signals that he was
destined to be a saint.
The cop made them promise that they would not start

RED ORC'S RAGE
fighting again and that they would go home immediately. A
call came in, and the fuzz left hurriedly. Freehoffer looked
as if he would like to keep threatening Jim and Sam, but he
shambled away down the alley. Jim looked for his book
bag. It was gone.
"For God's sake, what next?" he cried. "Someone stole
it! The books . . . I'll have to buy new ones!"
That was going to make his father even madder. It had
been hard enough to get the money for the textbooks at the
beginning of the semester. Eric Grimson would have more
to raise hell about than just the fight. And Eva Grimson
would have to take the purchase money out of what she
brought home from her cleaning job. No. His father would
insist that his son pay for it. Where would he get the cash?
Did bad things never end?
Jim's mother was still working up on Gold Hill when Jim
arrived home. But his father was waiting for him. He began
yelling at him to get his clothes into the washer in the
basement and to take a shower. Right now. The shock of the
shower might kill him, but Jim and the world would be
better off then. Jim tried to tell him why he got into the
fight. Eric Grimson paid no attention to his explanation. He
stood at the top of the basement stairs while Jim shucked off
his clothes and put them in the old washer.
"That'll take extra soap and water and gas heat and run
up the bills, and they're high enough now, though I can't
say you generally raise the water bill much," Eric said.
"Maybe I should look at this as a God-given chance to force
you to take a shower."
Jim waited until he had put on clean clothes before he
decided to tell his father about the stolen books. But, when
he reluctantly left his room, he found that his father was not
around. Eric Grimson had gone some place, probably five
blocks away to Tex's Tavern. He'd be spending the money
on booze that he could have used to buy the schoolbooks.
That reminded Jim that he had forgotten to call in to the
fast-food place where he worked. If he told the manager he
was sick—which he had done too many times—he would
probably be fired.
Well, so what?
It wouldn't be easy finding another job, that's what.
But he had promised Sam that he would go Halloweening
tonight, and he did not want to miss out on the fun.
If he could get his mother to one side, away from his
father, he might get pocket change from her. She'd dredge
it up from some place; she almost always did. However, he
knew how hard it was for her to do that. Though she would
not complain, her big sad eyes, her air of suppressed
reproach, disappointment, and defeat would make him feel

like a bum, a parasite, a bloodsucker, a failure, and a really
rotten son.
Her silence and her quiet manner made him feel far worse
than his father's ravings and rantings. At least he could
blow off steam when he argued with his father. But her
unwillingness to fight frustrated and wore him out. A
termite must feel that way when it was chewing merrily
along in wood and then ran slam-bang into iron.
The house was quiet except for a slight groan or a very
faint murmur now and then. Those could be the voices of
small shiftings of earth in the tunnels and shafts below.
They were warning the heedless humans above of the
coming big collapses. Or were they, as in the poem "Kubia
Khan" by Coleridge, "ancestral voices warning of war"? Or
trolls working away in the abandoned coal mines so they
could hasten the ruin of Belmont City's houses?
Man, I'm a case, Jim thought. My brain is like a bullet
that missed its target. It ricochets all over the place,
envisions a hundred scenarios where only one could be real.
57
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
I'm cut out to be a writer or a poet, not a garage mechanic.
He sat in a chair in the living room. He faced the fake
fireplace and the mantel, which held two glass balls with
Christmas scenes inside (turn the balls upside down and
then right side up and snow fell on the little houses and
people therein), statuettes of the Virgin Mary and St.
Stephan, two incense candles, a can of furniture polish
spray, an ashtray with a pile of cigarette stubs, and a music
box on top of which was a circle of white-clad but
nicotine-stained ballet dancers.
On the wall above the mantel was a large photograph of
Ragnar Fjalar Grimsson, Jim's dearly beloved grandfather,
dead for eight years now. Though Ragnar was smiling, he
looked as fierce as his namesake, the legendary Viking
king, Ragnar Hairy Breeches, whom he claimed to be
descended from. His white and bushy beard fell to below
his chest. His white eyebrows were as thick and as splendid
as God's must be (if there was a God), and the blue eyes
were as penetrating as the edge of a Norse pirate's war ax.
When the old man had died, his son, Eric, had taken down
the big painting of Jesus, despite his wife's pale protests,
and had put up the picture of his father.
It was, Jim had thought, a satisfactory substitute.
The old Norwegian was a real man. A far voyager on sea
and on land, an adventurer, tough, no complainer, a
go-getter, largely self-educated, a wide reader, afraid of
nobody and of no thing, a quoter of Shakespeare and Milton
and of the old Scandinavian sagas, yet one who enjoyed the
cartoon strips and who had read them to Jim before Jim
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (38 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

could read, stubborn, convinced that his way was the only
way but with a sense of humor and wit, and also convinced
that most of the present generation were degenerates.
It was a good thing old Ragnar had died. He'd be deeply
disgusted with his son and even more so with his grandson.
RED ORC'S RAGE
As for Ragnar's daughter-in-law, Eva, he'd never liked her,
though he had always treated her politely. She was scared of
him, and he scorned people he could scare.
His grandfather had at first been disturbed by Jim's
visions and dreams and stigmata. After a while, he had
decided that these were not necessarily signs that Jim was
mentally sick. Jim had been touched by the Fates, who gave
him second sight, a gift the Scotch called "fey." Jim could
see things invisible to others. Though the old man was an
atheist, he did believe, or professed to believe, in the
Noms, the three Fates of pagan Scandinavia. "Even today,
out in the rural and forest areas, you'll find Norwegians
who believe in destiny more than they do in their Lutheran
God."
His grandfather had taken Jim's small hands in his huge
and work-gnarled hands. He held them up so that the faint
whitish marks on Jim's fingernails shone in the light. Jim
was keenly aware of them and somewhat shy about people
seeing them. But Ragnar said, "Those are the marks the
Vikings called Nomaspor. They've been given to you by
the Noms as a special sign of their favor. You're lucky. If
the marks'd been dark, you'd be cursed with bad luck all
your life. But they're white, and that means you're going to
have good fortune most of your life."
Destiny. Mister Lum had said more than once in English
class, " 'Character determines destiny.' That's a quote from
Heraclitus, ancient Greek philosopher. Remember that, and
live by that. 'Character determines destiny.'"
That had deeply impressed Jim. On the other hand his
grandfather thought that character was given you by des-
tiny. Whatever the truth, Jim knew that he had been doomed
to be a loser. Never mind what old Ragnar had said about
Nomaspor. Jim Grimson was a hopeless case, everything a
hero was not. As the school psychologist had told him, he
59
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
had low self-esteem, could get along only with a few of his
peers, all as messed up as he was, couldn't relate to his
superiors, hated authority in whatever form it took, had no
drive to succeed, and was, in short, without brakes and on
the steep road to hell. Having said that, the psychologist had
added that Jim did have great potential even if his character
was chaotic and self-defeating. He could pull himself up by
his bootstraps. And then the psychologist really piled on the
crap.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (39 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Jim sighed. For the first time, he became aware of
something wrong with his surroundings, something maybe
not so wrong as missing. It took him a minute to realize that
he was enveloped in silence. No wonder he had been feeling
uneasy.
He went to the kitchen and turned the radio on. WYEK
was into "The Hour of Golden Oldies" and was playing
"Freak Out," the 1966 album in which Frank Zappa made
his debut with the Mothers of Invention. Jim had been four
then, ages ago.
Before the album was finished, Eric Grimson came
home. And the gates of hell opened.
60
CHAPTER 1 0
/\T 6:19, AN HOUR after sunset, Jim raised his bedroom
window and crawled out. Thirty minutes ago, he had eaten
the supper stealthily given him by his mother.
Eva Grimson had arrived a few minutes before her
husband came home and had started cooking supper. She
had asked Jim to turn the radio down, and he had done it.
He had said nothing about his troubles that afternoon. Eric
Grimson had reeled in at half past five, red-faced and
breathing fumes that would've floored a dragon. The first
thing he had done was to turn the radio off, yelling that he
didn't want that damn crap on when he was in the house.
Then, of course, he had started in on Jim. Eva had been
confused about it all until her husband told her of the
telephone call he had gotten from the police about Jim's
fight with the Freehoffer kid and the pukey mess on his
clothes.
One thing led to another—didn't it always?—and very
61
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
quickly father and son were shouting at each other. His
mother, facing the stove, her back to them, her shoulders
slumped, said nothing. Now and then she quivered as if
something inside her had bitten her. Finally, Eric had
commanded his son to go to his room. He sure as hell
wasn't going to get supper, he added.
Presently, silence settled throughout the house. Jim took
a tattered and yellow-paged paperback, Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein, from a shelf and tried to read it. Reread,
rather. He was in the mood for this story about the monster
made of dead human parts, the doomed outsider hated by all
humans and hating all humans, the rejected, the killer of the
natural-bom and the would-be killer of his maker, a man
who was in a sense his father.
But the godawful old-fashioned prose style had always
tended to throw him off. It certainly did now. He dropped
the book on the floor and roamed around the narrow room.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (40 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

After a while, the TV in the living room began blaring. Eric
Grimson was sitting there, a beer in his hand, watching the
boob tube. A few minutes later, Jim heard a knock on the
door. He opened it and saw his mother holding a tray with
supper on it.
"I can't let you go hungry," she whispered. "Here. When
you're done, put it under the bed. I'll get it ... you
know."
He said, "I know. Thanks, Mom," and he leaned over the
tray as he took it and kissed her sweaty forehead.
"I wish," she said, "I wish . . ."
"I know. Mom," he said. "I wish, too. But ..."
"Things could be . . ."
"Maybe, someday ..."
When they did talk to each other, they usually spoke in
fragments. Jim did not know why. Perhaps it was because
62
RED ORC'S RAGE
the pressures on them broke off their sentences. But he just
did not know.
He closed the door and devoured the mashed potatoes and
gravy, the fried ham, the beans, the celery, and the black
Hungarian bread. After hiding the tray under the bed, he
sneaked down the hall and used the bathroom. And, about
an hour after sunset, he crawled out of the window. If his
father discovered that he was gone, too bad.
The air temperature had warmed up to the seventies in the
late afternoon but had by now plunged into the upper fifties.
Though the stiff western breeze had softened somewhat, it
was still strong enough to make the air nippy. Clouds had
begun to form. The half-moon was draped in thin fleece. It
was a good night for Halloween.
He ducked down when he passed the living room
window. The TV was still blaring. When he got to the
sidewalk, which was well lit by a streetlamp, he saw that
the cracks in the cement had widened. He did not know
when this had occurred, but it seemed to him that they were
broader and more numerous than when he had entered the
house. However, he had been too agitated then to pay heed
to them.
Here came a group of trick-or-treaters, children costumed
as witches, demons, Klingons, skeletons, ghosts, Draculas,
Frankenstein's monsters, robots, Darth Vaders, and a single
punk—painted face, earrings, and Mohawk, probably his
parents' idea of a real monster. One kid, however, wore a
giant naked brain. That seemed right-on to Jim. The true
horrors of this world were spawned in the human mind.

Since the group was heading toward his house, Jim
walked faster. Though his father would not be answering
the doorbell, his mother might see him when she came out
to the porch to drop a Hershey's Kiss apiece into the sacks
held out by the kids. (This neighborhood was slim pick-
63
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
ings.) She would not say a word to her husband about it
unless he asked her if she'd seen their son. Then she'd feel
compelled to tell the truth. Otherwise, the saints, not to
mention the bogeymen, might get her.
Sam Wyzak was waiting for him on the front porch of his
house. He was smoking a cigarette, which meant that his
mother must be busy in the back of the house and wouldn't
see him. Sam's father, unlike Eric Grimson, would be
dropping candy into the kids' sacks. He'd be hitching
because it interfered with his TV-watching, but he'd do it.
He didn't give a damn if his son smoked as long as it didn't
make any trouble for him.
Sam gave Jim a cigarette, and they walked down the
street talking about the fight with The Blob and his buddies.
Then Sam slipped Jim an upper. Jim felt more than just an
upsurge of spirits and nerves. The drug hit him in the center
of his brain like an atomic missile striking dead on target.
He had never been hit so suddenly or with so much force by
so little. He was abnormally wide open, the walls broken,
the army in the castle sound asleep.
He was able a few days later to recall slices of what
happened in the next six hours. The rest of the nightmare
pie was gone, eaten up by the black beauties, marijuana
joints, beer, whiskey, and angel dust his friends had given
him. Until then, no matter how tempted, he had always
refused even to try dust. It had sent three of his friends into
convulsions and then fatal comas. But the deluge of the
lesser drugs and the booze had washed away his fear.
Jim and Sam went first to Bob Pellegrino's house. Here
they waited until Steve Larsen and Gizzy Dillard came, then
drove away in Bob's 1962 Plymouth, which, for a wonder,
was running. On the way to Rodfetter's Drive-in, Bob
opened a fifth of moonshine "white mule." Steve provided
a six-pack of Budweiser he had gotten his older brother to
64
RED ORC'S RAGE
buy for him. Half of the liquor and all of the beer was
consumed by the time that, whooping and yelling, they got
to the drive-in. A joint was half gone by then, and each had
swallowed a black beauty.
Rodfetter's was the hanging-out place, the "in" site, for
the Central crowd whose parents were blue-collar workers.
Jim and his friends did a lot of horseplay and monkeying
around there for several hours. They did not, unlike the
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (42 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
other students there, do much carhopping. Outside of their
small group, they had no friends or even close acquaintan-
ces. They were the pariahs, the untouchables, and the
unbearables, and they claimed to be proud of it.
Jim did not remember just how long they were there.
During this somewhat hazy time, he had smoked more
joints and drunk the warm beer Pellegrino produced from
the trunk. Then Veronica Pappas, Sandra Melton, and
Maria Tumbrille had shown up with some LSD. Veronica
was the lead female singer for the Hot Water Eskimos;
Maria, her understudy. Sandra was the rock group's man-
ager. Her nickname was "Bugs," but her close friends used
it only when she was not present. Sandy took offense when
she heard it. Unless, that is, she was in one of her
deep-blue, very deep and blue, depressions, lower than the
mud at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, farther out than the
cold and dead planet, Pluto.
Tonight, she was in a way-out talkative and jumping-up-
and-down mood.
Sometime during the evening, while they were sitting on
the Plymouth's hood or leaning against it, Steve Larsen
brought out some LSD in sugar cubes.
"I been hoarding this," he said. "Saving it for the right
time. Tonight's the night, Halloween. We can go ride
broomsticks with the witches, ride all the way to the
moon."
65

Jim later remembered that he had said something about it
being hallucinogenic, though he had trouble pronouncing it.
"I mean, it gives you visions, makes you see the
fourth-dimensional worlds, things that aren't there, scary
things, all of space and time at once. I don't need that. I get
visions naturally, and I don't like them. No, thanks."
"It ain't like heroin and cocaine," Steve said. "It don't
hook you, ain't habit-forming. Anyway, you ain't had them
visions for years."
"Oh, well, why not?" Jim had said. "What've I got to
lose besides my mind, and I don't have one, anyway."
"It's a ticket to heaven," Steve said. "I never been there,
but this shit'll take you to a place even better."
"All the way around the universe faster'n light, so they
say," Pellegrino said. "Coming back you meet yourself
going."
Jim ate the cube and then inhaled deeply from a brown
stick. They passed it around until it was a short butt. Steve
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (43 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
put it in his jacket pocket.
It must have been after that that someone suggested they
drive out to old man Dumski's apple orchard and push over
his outhouse. It was an old Halloween tradition that the
ramshackle wooden crapper be turned over. Or that an
attempt be made to do so since not many had succeeded.
The orchard farm had been in the county. But, as Belmont
City spread out, it had annexed the area around it.
Dumski's was at the end of a dirt road that led for half a
mile from the main highway. It was surrounded by a barbed
wire fence. The house had burned down years ago. Dumski
lived alone in the bam. The city had been trying for some
time to make him build a house, one which would have
indoor plumbing and a flush toilet. But the old recluse had
defied the city authorities and taken them to court.
He had a huge dog, a rottweiler, one of that black-and-
66
RED ORC'S RAGE
tan, huge-headed, sinister-looking, and terrifying breed
used in the film The Omen. The brute roamed the farm area
day and night and was only tied up when harvest time came.
Since Dumski had gotten the dog, nobody had trespassed on
his land.
"Anybody got downers?" Jim had said. "Put a bunch in
a hamburger and feed it to the dog. He falls asleep, then we
go in."
Those were the last words of good sense uttered that
night. Bob Pellegrino purchased a big hamburger, hold the
onions. He put a dozen downers in the bun, rewrapped it,
and they were off, eight jammed into the Plymouth like
circus clowns in a trick car, giggling and screaming while
WYEK lobbed the barrage of "A Day in the Life" through-
out the car, its quicksilver shrapnel shells exploding inside
their young souls. The Beatles had sung that twelve years
ago, shook the world with it in the primeval rock-dawn
when Jim had been only five years old. Bob "Guru"
Hinman, the ancient disc jockey who loved the hoary old
stuff (so did Jim) would be playing next Chuck Berry's
"Maybellene," which Guru claimed had started rock 'n roll.
Veronica sat on Jim's lap in the back seat. He was to
remember vaguely that she was messing around with his fly
but not what happened when she opened it. Probably
nothing. He had not had a hard-on for two weeks, that's
how depressed he had been. And he was supposed, at
seventeen, to be at the peak of his sexual drive.
Dumski's apple farm was on the other side of Gold Hill.
It took about twenty minutes to get there because of all the
red lights they hit, though Bob went through some. Then
they were on the highway. The headlights showed trees on
both sides. There was no oncoming or passing traffic. Jim
kept waiting for the hallucinations, but they did not come.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (44 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

67
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Or were they already here? Maybe this mundane Earth was
the basic hallucination?
Bob slowed the car down but not quickly enough. They
had passed the tumoff road to Dumski's. After Bob had
backed the car up and got it heading down the dirt road,
Sandy said, "Hadn't we better turn the radio off? It's loud
enough to wake up the dead!"
They all protested because Bob Dylan was in the middle
of "Desolation Row," and they wanted to hear it to its end.
They compromised by turning the volume down. As soon as
the classic song was over. Bob turned the set off. A moment
later, he turned the headlights off. The moonbeams coming
through gauzy clouds and gaps between them were enough
to show them their way.
The car moved slowly out of the tree-lined and shadowy
roadway and stopped in front of the gate in the barbed wire
fence.
68
CHAPTER 1 1
JIM DID NOT remember much of what had happened since
they had been at the drive-in. Many details were long
afterward given by Bob Pellegrino, who had not boozed and
drugged it up as much as the others because he was driving.
But he was not in what could be called a chemically
unsaturated state.
The barn loomed dark and sinister in the intermittent
moonlight. If Dumski was inside, he either had no lights on
or the shutters fit tightly over the windows. There was
neither sight nor sound of the rottweiler. The outhouse, said
to be a three-holer, was an indistinct shape about eighty feet
from the barn and to the left of the group. It had been
somewhat distant from the house, the remains of which
were a tumulus. Old Dumski had to trudge a long way to
use the outhouse.
They piled out of the car. Bob had cautioned them to be
quiet, but Gizzy slammed the door after getting out of the
69
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
car. Before he could be reprimanded by Bob, Gizzy got
sick. He went back down the road and into the woods so
that the sounds of his vomiting would be muffled. Even so,
they were too loud for Pellegrino, now the mother hen of
the group. Just after he started to walk after Gizzy to tell
him to pipe down, he stopped. A deep growl came from the
darkness on the other side of the fence. That hushed the
youths.
After a few seconds of looking around frantically, they
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (45 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
saw the huge dog behind the gate. That it only growled and
that it was such a shadowy shape made it more menacing.
Pellegrino, murmuring, "Here, doggie! Nice doggie!" ap-
proached it slowly. When he got close to the gate, he threw
the hamburger over it. It landed with a plop. A few seconds
later, he turned and whispered, "He bolted it down."
Sandy Melton had added acid to the hamburger while
they were on the highway. She had said something about
wondering what kind of hallucinations a dog would have.
Jim remembered that later because it had struck him as very
funny. The dog kept on growling. Then, after a few
minutes, the growls began to get weak. Presently, it started
to wander away, staggering. Before it was thirty feet away,
it collapsed.
The gate was bound with a heavy chain, the ends of
which were secured by a big lock. Jim went over the gate,
the top of which bore strands of barbed wire. He helped
Pellegrino over, and they assisted Sam Wyzak and Steve
Larsen over. All of them had bloodied hands but did not feel
pain.
Sam said, "Holy Mother! The barn just turned into a
castle! It's made of glass and diamonds, and it's shimmering
in the moonlight!"
Nobody thought to tell him that there was, at that
moment, no moonlight.
70
RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim was having no visual hallucinations, but he did feel
as if his legs had stretched out, like the kid in the fairy story
with the seven-league boots, and that he could reach the
outhouse in one stride. He was distracted, though, because
the girls refused to go over the gate. They could feel the
barbs, and they had seen the rips in the boys' clothes.
"Besides," Sandy Melton said, "who's going to take care of
Gizzy? We might have to run like hell. We don't want to
leave Gizzy behind."
"You're right," Bob said. "OK. This won't take long; we
don't need you, anyway. You get Gizzy into the car."
The three boys walked along the gravel road running
from the gate to the heap that had been the farmhouse.
Before they got to it, they angled across toward the
outhouse. Just as they reached the stench-emitting crapper,
a break in the clouds flooded moonlight around them. They
could even see the crescent carved in the door.
Jim was surprised that Bob, Sam, and Steve also had
reached the structure with only one stride. They did not look
as if their legs were elongated. Then Bob said, "Where's
Sam?"
Jim turned to indicate Sam, who had been by his side.
But Sam was no longer there. He was standing at a point
halfway between the gate and the outhouse and was staring
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (46 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
fixedly at the barn. Later, Jim would figure that he had just
thought that Sam had walked all the way with him. Or had
someone else, someone unknown, been at his side?
"OK," Bob said. "We don't need him. But don't forget to
bring him along when we go back."
They went to the north side of the outhouse, and all three
began pushing on it. The structure rocked back and forth but
would not tip over.
"Man, it's heavier than my mother's doughnuts!" Bob
said. "Listen up. We gotta get it oscillating, get it into the
77
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
right frequency, then, when I give the word, all shove
together hard as hell!"
They began rocking it again. Just as they finally heaved
and the wooden shack toppled over, they heard a yell. They
started to whirl to see who was making the noise. Then a
shotgun boomed, and they heard pellets cutting through the
leaves of a nearby tree. Steve, yelling, ran away. Pellegrino
grabbed Jim when he fell backward. They screamed as,
locked together, they hurtled into the hole and bounced off
the slimy dirt wall and into the godawful excrement. They
hit feet first and were quickly up to their necks in the
loathsome stuff.
The shotgun boomed again. Faintly, Jim could hear the
shrieks of the girls. Steve Larsen was no longer yelling. Jim
and Bob screamed for help. For a second afterward, there
was silence. Then he heard a growling. The next he knew,
the dog was in the hole. It came down like a vengeance
from the gods, landed right in front of Jim and Bob,
splashed their heads and open mouths, came up like a cork,
and began struggling.
Jim's toes touched the bottom or what he hoped was the
bottom. Bob, who was taller, had his whole head sticking
out from the muck. Jim was up to his chin. But the crazed
dog knocked him back, and he went under again.
Later, Jim knew that the rottweiler had recovered some-
what from the drugs and run, or maybe walked, since it was
still weak and dazed, to the hole. Not very alert yet, it had
fallen, or maybe jumped, into the hole.
Now, he and Bob had to keep from being bitten by the
dog—those powerful jaws had a 600-pound pressure—or
being scratched by its flailing forefeet or being thrust under
by its weight. They could see only very dimly because the
moonlight did not reach to the bottom and their eyes were
covered by the slime. Then Bob got sick and was vomiting,
72
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (47 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
and that caused Jim to throw up also. The puke didn't make
things any worse—nothing could—but it certainly did not
help their situation. Moreover, it was very difficult to avoid
the jdog while heaving their guts out.
Finally, though weak from his efforts, Jim reached out
and grabbed the dog by its ears. Frenzied, he shoved its
head under the surface.
At that moment, a flashlight shone from above, and a
cracked old voice yelled at him.
"Leave the dog alone, or I'll shoot you! Don't touch him,
you ... !"
Jim did not understand the following words. Dumski had
switched to Polish.
"Don't shoot, for God's sake!" Jim cried. He released the
dog. It emerged, sputtering and growling, but it no longer
tried to attack him. It had occurred to the dog that it had
better save its strength to keep from drowning. Or to keep
from choking to death. It dog-paddled furiously just to stay
above the surface.
"Yeah, you damn fool!" Bob yelled. "You'll kill the dog,
too!"
Pellegrino was not worried about the rottweiler, but he
had wits enough to know that Dumski was in a terrible rage,
out of his mind, if he did not think about what a shotgun
blast in that narrow shaft would do to its occupants.
"Oh!" Dumski said. "Don't go away! I'll be gone for a
minute."
"Sure. We'll just leave," Bob said. He groaned. "Oh,
God, what a mess!"
It seemed like a long time before Dumski returned,
though it must have been only two minutes. Puffing and
panting, the old man kneeled at the edge of the hole. Then
something struck Jim, not hard, across his face. He did not
73
PHILIP JOSE FARMER RED ORC'S RAGE
know what it was until Dumski shone the flashlight down
on the rope he had dropped.
From far away but still loud enough to be heard over the
screams of the girls came the wail of a siren. The cops were
coming.
"Tie the rope around the dog!" Dumski said.
"How about us?" Bob shrieked.
"The dog comes up first!"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (48 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"Are you out of your mind?" Jim screamed. "How are
we going to do that? It'll bite our hands off!"
"Get us out of here!" Pellegrino shouted. "I can't
breathe! This stuff's choking me to death! I tell you, I'll die
if I don't get out of here soon!"
"Serves you assholes right," Dumski said. "Tie the rope
around the dog, then maybe I'll think about getting you
out."
"We're gonna die!" Bob bellowed, then choked as a
wave of excrement caused by the animal's struggles slapped
him in the mouth.
"Get the rope around the dog!" Dumski shrieked. "Quick
about it, or I'll leave you to die!"
That just could not be done without getting bitten. But the
siren, which had been getting nearer, died. A door
slammed. A man yelled something. Dumski muttered
something and then was gone. Jim thought about shoving
the dog under again. If it was dead, it would be easy to tie
the rope around it. But Dumski would shoot them if the dog
died.
Another stretch of seeming-forever passed. Then Jim
heard voices approaching. Dumski had unlocked the gate
and let the cops through it. Jim had never been glad to see
the police before this; now, he was very happy. Never mind
what was going to happen to him after he got out of the
hole.
74
A flashlight held by a cop illuminated the hole. The cop
laughed loudly for a while, then said, "For God's sake,
Pete, look at this! You ever see such a sight!"
Pete looked down and laughed. "Man, you boys're in
deep shit, and that's a fact!"
They went away with Dumski. After another long time,
they came back with a ladder. They let it down and told Jim
and Bob to climb up it. But the dog was between them and
the ladder, and it would not allow them to get on it.
Meanwhile, Dumski complained that the dog had to be
gotten out, and, if the boys came out first, who'd tie the
rope around it?
"We're not getting down there," a cop said. "You can go
down and tie him up. But the kids gotta be got out first."
Dumski argued without success. The ladder was moved
to the other side of the hole. Jim went up first. He was so
weak and his hands were so slippery on the rungs that he
had a hard time getting up. He had to drag himself out of the
hole and onto the ground. The cops would not help him.
Bob came up then and lay down, breathing hard, by his
side. Old man Dumski, grumbling, went down the ladder
after it had been moved back to the wall near the dog. Then
the cops hauled up the rottweiler. When it tried to bite one
of them before it was halfway out of the hole, it was
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (49 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
dropped back into the mess. Dumski screamed at them that
the splash had gotten him even filthier. Finally, the dog was
hauled up again, the cops hitching about how disgustingly
slimy the rope was. Dumski came up at the same time and
pulled the dog off to the barn, where he hosed it off. The
dog howled as the cold water struck it.
"You two better go over there and get hosed off, too," the
cop called Pete said. "No way are you going to get into the
squad car stinking like you do now."
Jim by now really did not care about anybody except
75
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
himself. Sam was still in a trance, enthralled by the barn,
the glittering Emerald City of Oz in his mind. The squad car
had driven through the gate to a place near the barn. Its
headlights shone on the huddled-together and forlorn-
looking girls. Evidently Steve had escaped, and Gizzy had
stayed in the woods.
Pete went to the squad car and called for backup. His
partner. Bill, started Bob and Jim toward the barn so that
they could be hosed off. Before they got there, the dog
attacked its owner. The events of the night, plus its
drug-dazed condition and its resentment of the cold water,
had confused it. Or perhaps it knew that it was attacking
Dumski. It may never have liked the old man.
The dog knocked Dumski over and fastened its teeth into
his left arm. Dumski screamed as the jaws clamped down
and its teeth struck bone and blood soaked through the
sleeve of his jacket. The cops could not get the dog to let
loose. They shot it dead. That made Dumski furious. He
attacked the cops, who had to handcuff him before arresting
him. Then Pete called for an ambulance.
Afterward, Bill hosed off Jim and Bob. They yelled with
the shock and danced around, begging for mercy. None was
given. Then Pete went inside the bam and got some towels
for the boys so they could try to dry themselves off.
"We'll get pneumonia!" Pellegrino cried.
"You're lucky if that's all you get," Pete said.
76
CHAPTER 1 2
"A
/\ HELL OF a mess you got us into," Eric Grimson said.
His mother murmured, "Jim, how could you?"
He restrained his desire to say, "It was easy."
He was wrapped in a blanket and on the back seat of their
1968 Chevy. He had not stopped shivering since the cop had
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (50 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

doused him with cold water. His father, out of pure
meanness, had refused to turn the car heater on. Though Jim
had sloshed water around in his mouth in the courthouse and
had spit it out a dozen times, his mouth tasted of human
excrement. Well, why not? He'd eaten shit all his life.
"It's a lucky thing for you that Sam's uncle is the night
judge," Eric growled. "Otherwise, you'd be in jail."
"Juvenile hall," Jim said.
"What the hell's the difference?" Eric said loudly,
gripping the steering wheel as if he wanted to tear it off the
column. "It's just a station on the way to prison, anyway!
I've known since you was twelve years old you was
hell-bound for prison!"
77
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"Please, Eric," Eva Crimson said softly. "Don't say
that."
The car traveled through deserted streets and by dark
houses. Halloween had long been over, and everybody had
gone to bed even though, in this area, very few had work to
go to in the morning. The time from when the cops had
appeared at Dumski's to his release in his parents' custody
had been long. After being frisked, he and his friends had
had to walk a line to test their sobriety. Afterward, they
were tested with a breath analyzer. All flunked. Two more
tests which I couldn't pass, Jim had thought. Their rights
were read, and they were handcuffed, jammed into two
squad cars, and driven downtown. They had been in a
holding cell for an hour before being marched to a room
where blood and urine samples were taken. Jim's brain was
fogbound but not so much that he did not realize that traces
of the drugs would still be in his bloodstream.
An hour later, they were again taken to a holding room,
and a half hour after that, they were in night court. The
culprits' parents were also there, except for Sandy Melton's
father, who was out of town. Jim's mother was weeping;
tears dripped on her rosary beads as she told them. Eric
looked hung over and very furious.
Sam's uncle was an old shriveled-up bald man with a
long face and a big beaked nose with many broken veins.
Those features and his long skinny neck, his whiskey-shot
red eyes, his bald head, the black gown, and his bunched-
over shoulders made him look like a vulture. However, Jim
thought, the judge must have felt more like a canary who
sees a cat. His nephew Sam was facing some serious
charges: trespassing, destruction of private property, drunk

the curfew law. He was possibly involved in injury causing
loss of a limb and, if Dumski died, aiding and abetting

manslaughter. He could be charged with contributing to the
dog's death. Dumski was in the hospital, and he might lose
his arm.
These were not issues to take lightly. Judge Wyzak
couldn't let his nephew and the other long-haired freaks off
easy. But if he dealt with them as they really deserved, his
sister-in-law, Mrs. Wyzak, would wring his neck. Not
figuratively but literally.
The alleged culprits were minors, and that gave the judge
a way out for the time being. He lectured them severely and
then released them into the custody of their parents.
At least, Jim thought, possession of drugs and alcohol
was not one of the charges. The girls had gotten rid of the
bottles and capsules as soon as they heard the siren in the far
distance. Sandy Melton had frisked Sam Wyzak, removed
his pills, and tossed them into the woods. Jim had never had
any drugs in his pockets, and Bob Pellegrino had dropped
his while he was still in the outhouse hole.
After the judge dismissed them, Sam's mother had
grabbed him by his ear and pulled him along behind her
while he whined and windmilled one arm. Jim thought that
she must think she was Aunt Polly and Sam was Tom
Sawyer, for God's sake!
The car pulled up into the oil-stained gravel driveway by
the house. "Home, sweet home," Eric Grimson said. "Ain't
it something? An out-of-work crane operator, a Holy Roller
Catholic cleaning houses for rich people, and a hippie loser
who's stupid and crazy. I could stand the stupid if he wasn't
crazy, and I could stand the crazy if he wasn't stupid. Now
he's gonna be a jailbird. His bimbo sister's got two bastard

to China one of these days, not that I give a damn! Where
did I go wrong. God?"
"God doesn't care for us pissants," Jim said as he got out
of the car. He slammed the door hard.
His mother said, "Jim! Don't blaspheme. Things are bad
enough."
"He's got a big foul stupid mouth, your son has!" Eric
yelled. "Why in hell couldn't he have been one of your
miscarriages?"
"Please, Eric," Eva said softly, "you'll wake up the
neighbors."

Eric howled like a wolf. Then he said, "Wake 'em up?
Who cares? They're gonna read about your son in the
papers anyway, know all about us, as if they didn't already
know! Who cares?"
Jim opened the side door. His father began chewing out
Eva because she was supposed to have made sure that all the
windows and doors were shut and locked. Jim turned in the
doorway and said, "What's the difference? What do we
have that's worth stealing?"
He went into the house, but his father stormed in after
him and grabbed him by the shoulder. Jim lunged ahead and
ran up the stairway to the hallway, leaving the blanket in his
father's hand.
Eric shouted after him, "I might have something worth
stealing if it wasn't for you and your mother!"
Jim ran into the bathroom, closed the door, and locked it.
He brushed his teeth with the salt and baking powder from
the rusty cabinet above the bowl. Then he cleaned his
fingernails and shucked off his clothes, which were still
wet. While his father stood in the hall by the door and
yelled, now and then thumping his fist on the door, Jim
showered. It took a long time for him to feel clean.
He did not turn off the water until it suddenly became
80
RED ORC'S RAGE
cold. That would anger his father even more. He was
always stressing the need to conserve on water and gas. At
the same time, of course, he was always yelling at Jim to
take a bath.
Despite the cooling-off effects of the shower, Jim still felt
hot inside himself. If his anger could be seen, he'd be
glowing in the dark. Everything had gone wrong today, like
it did most days. Gone wrong? That was an understatement.
It had been one humiliation after another. Shame after
shame, failure after failure.
He stood in the fog-filled and warm room for a minute or
so. As soon as he left it, he'd have his father on his neck.
And, sure as cause and effect, he'd hit his father whether or
not his father struck him first. The red cloud building up in
him made that certain.
Reluctantly, he unlocked and opened the door. Eric
Grimson was not there. Voices came from the kitchen along
with the odor of coffee. His father's tones were subdued,
and his mother's were barely audible. Maybe the old man
had quieted down, though that did not seem likely. The
furnace came on, its fans drowning out the kitchen noises.
The heat struck Jim's legs. He was grateful for that since he
had started shivering again as soon as he had left the muggy
bathroom.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (53 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Naked, his damp clothes draped over his arm, he walked
quickly to his room. He closed the door behind him,
dropped the clothes on the floor, and went to the closet. Just
as he reached into it to take his pajamas from a hook, he was
startled by a loud bang. Whirling, he saw his father
charging through the doorway. Eric's face was red, and his
hands were clenched. Whatever had gone on in the kitchen,
it had not pacified him.
"Get your clothes on!" he howled. "Don't you have no
decency!"
81
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
The unfaimess of the insult—after all, his father had
burst in without asking permission—squeezed the anger in
Jim down to a tiny hot ball. A little more heat, a little more
pressure, and it would go up, out, and away. But it would
take Eric Grimson with it.
"From now on, things're gonna be different!" his father
yelled. "You'll either shape up or ship out, that's for sure!
First thing . . . !"
He looked wildly around, then reached into his back
pocket and brought out a jackknife. He opened the blade
and began slashing at the posters of the rock groups and
stars. Before Jim could yell in protest, he saw the Hot Water
Eskimos being cut into strips. Then Eric attacked the poster
of Keith Moon.
"All this shit's gotta go!" Eric screamed.
The red-hot ball exploded in white flame.
Shrieking, Jim jumped at his father, clamped a hand on
his left shoulder, spun him around, and struck him in the
nose. Eric Grimson staggered back against the poster, blood
running from his nostrils. Jim hit him in the shoulder with
his fist though he had meant to strike his chin. Eric dropped
the knife and closed with his son. Face to face, wrapped in
each other's arms, grunting, wheezing, they swayed back
and forth.
"I'll kill you!" Eric screeched.
Jim screamed and tore himself loose. He leaped back. He
was panting, his heart beating so hard that it seemed to him
that it would tear itself apart. Then, piercing the drumming
of blood in his ears, came the clicking of a lock. So loud
was the sound, the lock had to be huge. The key turning in
it also had to be gigantic. A groaning followed the clicking.
It sounded like a very heavy door with rusty hinges being
opened.
The floor dropped, the walls tilted, and books tumbled

out from the shelves. Jim and his father fell on the floor.
They got up quickly, looking at each other with wide eyes.
Plaster dust fell on them along with chunks. Jim saw them
bounce off his father. The white dust covered Eric's head
and shoulders and powdered the two streams of blood
trickling down from his nose.
Eva Grimson screamed in the kitchen.
"Oh, my god!" Eric howled. "This is it!"
The house lurched again.
"Get out! Get out!" Eric shouted. He whirled and ran out
of the room. He had to lean to one side to compensate for
the slope of the floor. Even so, his shoulder struck the side
of the doorway.
Jim began to laugh, and he kept on laughing. The house
was going to fall deep into the earth. Maybe his parents
would get out in time, maybe not. Whatever happened, it
would come from fate, from the Noms. Justice and fairness
had nothing to do with it. And he would stay here and go
down with the ship. Let the earth gulp him down. It was
better so, and it was also laughable.
Jim did not remember anything after that. He was told
that his parents did get out of the house and scrambled
across the front porch, which had been torn away from the
main structure, and across the gapful yard and onto the
sidewalk. But they then had to go across the street because
the cement they were standing on was shoved even more
upwards and made larger fissures. The house lurched and
sank another foot. The neighbors on both sides of the
Crimsons' house ran screaming from their leaning houses.
The whole neighborhood came alive, lights going on,
people coming out on the front porches and crying out
questions, children being bundled up and put in cars for a
quick getaway.

Sirens wailed in the distance as the police cars and the
fire engines raced toward Complanter Street.
Eva Grimson began crying out that someone should go
into the house and rescue her son. No one volunteered. Eric
insisted, over and over, that Jim was just delayed because
he was putting on his clothes. Eva said that Jim must be
hurt, and he was probably trapped.
Just as the squad cars and fire engines and ambulances
pulled up, Eva ran toward the house. Eric and two neigh-
bors grabbed her and held her while she screamed and
struck at them and begged them to let her go.
"You're a coward!" she said to Eric. "If you were a real
man, you'd go after Jim!"

The lights had gone out in the house; the power lines had
been torn from the house. Suddenly, two small lights
appeared in the doorway. They were candles, one in each of
Jim's hands, and they shed illumination on his wild face and
naked body. He could not be seen below the knees,
however. The house leaned so much that he had to stand on
a floor which dropped steeply away from the bottom of the
twisted doorway.
Jim shouted something unintelligible to the people across
the street. He jumped up and down, waving the candles,
which he had picked up from the floor in the room his
mother used as a shrine.
Seeing these, Eva began struggling even harder. She
shrieked, "The candles! The candles! They'll set the house
on fire! He'll bum, bum, oh, my God, he'll bum to death!"
The cops and the firelighters had by then cleared away
most of the crowd so that the engines could be moved closer
to the house. A fire department lieutenant and a police
captain questioned the Grimsons but got only hysterical and
confused answers. They could, however, see Jim in the
doorway.
"Nuts, completely off his rocker," the captain said.
Shortly after this, another light shone in the house.
"Fire! Fire! For God's sake, save him!" Eva cried.
That must have deepened her agony. The candles she had
lit for the Holy Family and the saints were going to cause
Jim's death and put him for eternity in the greater flames.
The firefighters had discovered by then that the pipe to
the nearest fire hydrant had been broken by the shifting of
the earth. They brought the water truck up close and
attached their hoses to it. Meanwhile, the captain and the
lieutenant had ventured as close as they dared. Using his
bullhorn, the policeman was urging Jim to get out of the
house.
The earth shrugged beneath the crowd. The beams in the
house snapped with loud reports. The house slid down and
tilted even more. Jim disappeared from the doorway,
dropped down and backward. The spectators ran away.
"Son of a bitch!" the lieutenant said. "Someone's got to
go in after the kid!" He looked around for likely volunteers.
The flames were getting big on the side of the house
nearest the driveway. Smoke poured out and was caught by
the wind. The house next to it was going to catch fire soon
unless the hoses could stop it. And, since the gas lines to the
house must be broken, the fire could cause a hell of an
explosion.
The lieutenant could not see Jim Grimson, but it was
evident that he was throwing objects through the doorway.
The spotlights from the trucks showed him, a few seconds
later, that these were statuettes of the saints and the Holy
Family. Most of them were broken.

"The kid's crazy as a loon!" the captain said.
It was then that the name of Jim Grimson sparked the
captain's recall. Pete and Bill had told him about the
stoned-out and drunked-up youths who'd pushed over old
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
man Dumski's outhouse and about two of them falling into
the crap. Until now, the captain had failed to connect the
hilarious incident with the people who owned this house.
"The kid's hopped up," he told the lieutenant. "I heard
all about him earlier tonight. Maybe we should forget about
him. He'll be better off if he doesn't make it."
The lieutenant looked reproachfully at the captain. He did
not say anything, but he got what he was thinking across to
the captain. No matter how worthless or vicious the subject
was, he, she, or it had to be saved.
"Just kidding," the captain said. "But I'd sure hate to
lose good men."
The lieutenant ordered that ropes and a ladder be brought
out. He asked for volunteers and got four, from whom he
picked two. One was a black fireman, George Dillard,
Gizzy's father. He had long ago given up his hopes that his
son would be a lawyer, and he knew Jim Grimson only too
well. But he was brave. Moreover, if he rescued the kid, he
would gain another handhold on the rung of the ladder to
higher rank and pay. God knows he needed it, and if he had
to put his ass in a sling to get it, he would. Black firepersons
were not promoted very often despite affirmative action and
equal opportunity quotas and all that. Not in Belmont City,
anyway.
The man who accompanied him was a wild man of Irish
descent who was eager to be in on the rescue attempt. The
more dangerous it was, the better he liked it.
Ropes tied around their waists, the loose ends held by
other men and two women, Dillard and Boyd moved across
the broken yard. Their smoke masks made them look like
two enormous insectine St. Francises on an errand of
mercy. They could see that the insane youth inside the
house was still throwing objects out through the front
doorway—a coffee pot, coffee cups and drinking glasses, a
86
RED ORC'S RAGE
skillet, table cutlery, a portable radio, albums of records,
clothes, and photos.
By now, the flames were leaping from the side of the
house, though not from that part which was below ground.
The hoses had been turned on it but, so far, without avail.
Before the two firemen got to the doorway, the barrage of
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (57 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

stuff cast out of the house ceased. They could faintly hear
the howling of Jim Grimson above the crackling of the fire,
the sound of the water striking the house, and the cries of
the spectators.
They halted when the ground moved again and the house
dropped a few inches. Smoke suddenly billowed out of the
front doorway and the windows, the glass of which had
been shattered and fallen away. Dillard and Boyd did not
have much time.
Jim was curled in the living room, holding the painting of
his grandfather between his arms and his drawn-up knees.
He was wedged in a comer formed by a wall, which was
part floor now, and by the floor, which was part wall. His
eyes were closed, but his mouth spat gibberish between fits
of coughing. Smoke covered the white plaster dust on his
body and face. A few more minutes of inhaling the smoke
would have killed him unless the rapidly spreading fire had
gotten to him first. As it was, he and his rescuers got out of
the house only thirty seconds before the house fell inwards.
Reduced in size suddenly, it disappeared entirely from
sight. Flames and smoke leaped up from the hole. More
than one spectator thought that it looked as if a gate to Hell
had been opened.
Jim was rushed to Wellington Hospital. He did not
recover consciousness for two days, though whether the
smoke or his psychotic state, as the doctors called it, was
responsible would never be known.
When Jim woke up, he remembered only one thing from
87
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
the moment the house clicked and groaned. It was a vision,
the first in many years. He had seen a tall and naked youth
chained to a tree. He resembled nobody Jim had ever seen
before. Just within the borders of this vision was a hand
holding a huge silvery sickle. It did not move, but it was
obviously threatening. It was destined to sweep up and then
down, and Jim had no doubts about what it was going to cut
off.
The sickle also looked to him like a giant question mark.

JIM'S WARDROOM WALL now bore a large five-pointed star.
Each arm was composed of five illustrated paperback
covers taped to the wall. The topmost arm contained covers
from Farmer's first book in the World of Tiers series. The
Maker of Universes. The second. The Gates of Creation,
formed the horizontal arm on the left. Going counterclock-
wise, the next arm held covers from the third novel, A Private

Cosmos. The next. Behind the Walls of Terra covers. The fifth
arm of the star was formed by The Lavalite World.
This was to be Jim's third serious attempt to get into a
Tiersian universe. The five-pointed star was his gateway.
Most patients called their gateway a mantra. The others, a
sigil. Tragil was Jim's name for his entrance device. By
combining both symbols in a portmanteau word, he made it
twice as powerful as an ordinary gateway.
89
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
It was half past eight in the evening. His room lights were
out, but the insurance company building across the street
provided a twilight strong enough for him to see the tragil.
The door to his room was closed. Though it had no lock, it
displayed on its hallway side a taped notice that he was
"gating." He could hear, very faintly. Brooks Epstein
chanting in Hebrew in the next room.
Jim sat in the chair that he had pulled up next to the bed.
Staring at the vacant space in the center of the star, he also
began chanting.
"ATA MATUMA M'MATA!"
Over and over, the words coming faster and faster and
getting louder and louder, he launched the ancient vocal
mantra at the center of the star, the round white blankness.
"ATA MATUMA M'MATA!"
Just as a laser structured wild-running photons into a
channeled beam, so the chant arranged force lines as a
blaster to open a hole in the wall between two universes.
It also was a carriage to transport the chanter through a
universe.
He had not found it easy to do. The first time, he had felt
himself borne by a soundless but very strong wind toward
and then through the hole. He was in a blackness which felt
very cold and, at the same time, very hot. These and the
sense of being lost and out of control had frightened him
even more than his childhood visions. He had lost his
courage and striven to swim back against the wind. For a
few seconds, he had feared that he would not make it.
Then something had snapped like a rubber band stretched
too far, and he had awakened sitting in the chair. He was
shivering and moaning and sweating. The clock told him
that he had been gone for two seconds. Yet, he had had a
sense of many hours having passed.
That was the end of his first expedition.
90
RED ORC'S RAGE
He had told about this during the group therapy the next
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (59 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

day. No one had scoffed at his experience or accused him of
cowardice. Anyone who did this would be sat upon at once
by the staff member supervising the group. It was strictly
against policy for anyone to voice disbelief in the narratives
of others. That could invalidate the belief of the traveler in
his or her journey and, thus, slow down or even end
progress in therapy. Besides, all had gone through obstacles
which were different in form but similar in emotional
content.
The second time, he had conquered enough of his panic
and fright to persist. Up to a point, that is. The blackness
and the cold and heat had suddenly vanished. The wind
became much weaker. He was surrounded by walls—lines
of force?—that came up at many angles from some abyss
and down from a vast space. They glowed whitely and
intersected each other, then continued their extensions
through other walls. They formed a jigsaw puzzle in four,
maybe more, dimensions. But he could not grasp their
extra-dimensionalness, their essences. Across, along, and
up were dimensions that his brain knew. These other
extensions, however, were beyond his comprehension. Yet
he knew that they were there.
That was so weird that he almost surrendered to his fears
and went back "home" before he lost his way forever.
Abruptly, the walls fell away. They did not collapse as
walls on Earth would. They just disappeared in some
fashion he could not fathom. Their afterimages glowed
briefly, then were gone.
He was in one of the worlds of the Lords. He did not
know how he knew this. But he did. Though he was still
frightened, he was too curious to allow himself to be sucked
up by the winds of return.
Though he could see, he was not in a body with flesh and
91
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
organs. Perhaps he was an astral soul. It did not matter.
That he was out of Earth's universe and in a Lord's was
enough for him.
He seemed to be high above a planet which had the same
shape and size as Earth. The sun was green, however.
Later, he would find that the color of the sky varied
according to the day of the week. A week here was nine
days long. And the Lord who had made this world had
arranged for the sky color to change every day.
He descended swiftly while hoping that he was going
toward his goal. He had selected Red Ore as the one in
whom he would be incorporated. But if he could pick the
person and the place for his otherworid rendezvous, he
could also pick the time. It seemed logical.
He had concentrated, while chanting, on a time many
thousands of years in the past, hoping to zero in on Red Ore
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (60 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

when he was still a child of seven. The events in the Tiers
series would not take place until much much later. He was
the only one in the therapy group who had chosen not to
travel into the present.
Porsena had asked him why he had done this. Jim had
said that he did not know why. It just seemed the right thing
to do. The doctor had not continued questioning him about
it, but he undoubtedly would note this development for
future investigation.
Like Earth seen from the top of the atmosphere, the
continents and seas of this planet were nowhere near as
clearly distinguishable as on a map. Great cloud masses
roamed it, but he could see the roughly cross-shaped
continent toward which he was drawn as if he were
connected to invisible and spiderweb-thin cables. Down he
went, and the land spread out below him as if it, not he,
were moving.
Then he was above a gigantic ring of mountains in the
92
RED ORC'S RAGE
center of which was a plain, in the center of which was a
single enormous mountain. The top of this was a relatively
flat plain with rivers and creeks and many forests. Here and
there were clusters of round, cone-roofed houses. He was
too high to see any people or animals.
In the center of the plain was a structure so huge and
strange that his already almost-overpowering awe became
greater. Nine vast pylons two miles high curved inwards
like elephants' tusks. Inside the pylons were three floors,
the bottom one of which was a half-mile above the ground.
It was transparent, thus allowing the few tenants there to see
below the villages and farms of the non-Lords. These were
along a river at least two miles broad which ran from a lake
formed by cataracts from the mouths of vast crystalline
statues placed along the edges of the bottom floor. Mists
swirled up from the cataracts but did not reach the floor.
The second floor, also transparent, had less area than the
first, though it covered at least seven square miles. Like the
bottom level, it contained small dwellings and some large
buildings and walled-in areas of earth on which grew trees
and other plants. Some were fields bearing plants or
enclosing pastures on which animals grazed.
The third floor was only two miles square. On it were
houses and some gigantic structures the function of which
Jim did not know. Many of these resembled somewhat the
ancient temples of Kamak in Egypt as they looked when
first built. Yet, though they reminded Jim of the Egyptian
structures, they differed in many respects. The hundreds of
statues at their entrances and sides were not Egyptian or like
anything on Earth of which he knew.
At the apex, held within the curve of the inward-curving
pylons, was a green emerald. This seemed larger than any

cathedral on Earth. It had been carved to make doors and
windows and was hollow. Or perhaps it had been made in a
93
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
mold which provided the openings and the empty space. He
would learn that it was tiny compared to the diamond on one
of the planets of one of Urizen's worlds. That Brobding-
nagian gem was a dam for a river that made the Mississippi
seem a trickle in a child's mud pie.
Down he went. Though the emerald reflected the rays of
the sun from its huge facets in a glory of many-beamed
light, Jim was not blinded. He could see, but he had no eyes
to be dazzled. The jewel shot out as if it were exploding,
and he was dwarfed by a facet directly ahead of him and
then was through it and inside the temple. That, he now
realized, was what the gem was—a temple.
The vast interior was shadowy except for the very center
of the floor. A ray of bright light coming from an unseen
source illuminated the floor in the middle. Outside its area
were very large and somehow ominous statues. They
crowded the floor and were set in a rising series of niches on
the curving walls. As they neared the apex of the temple,
they became vague figures. Some could not be seen at all
from the floor, but he felt their presence.
It was a very scary place for Jim. How it affected the
seven-year-old boy standing in its center, Jim could not
know. The child. Ore, might have been there several times,
but he would perhaps find it frightening. Awing, at least.
Jim called the boy Ore because he knew, without know-
ing how he knew, that the boy was not yet called Red Ore.
The boy and two adults were the only human beings in
the temple. Some other being was there, yet it was hidden.
It filled the entire chamber with a brooding menace.
The man was tall, handsome, blond-haired, and blue-
eyed. His name was Los, and he was Ore's father. The
woman was as tall as he, statuesque, aubum-haired, and
green-eyed. She was Ore's mother, Enitharmon. Both wore
ankle-length gauzy robes which concealed little. His robe
94
RED ORC'S RAGE
had a purple hem band; hers, a blue. He held a censer in his
right hand and swung it back and forth slowly while he
chanted in a language Jim could not understand. (Though
Jim had no ears, he could hear.) From the censer came an
orange smoke with an odor that was a mixture of bitter
almonds and sweet apples.
Enitharmon held a wand at the end of which was a circlet
containing a large and scarlet uncut gem. She waved it in a
ritualistic manner.

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
The boy stood rigid, his green eyes rolled up to look at
the ceiling, his arms held close to his sides, one hand a fist,
the other open. Now and then, Los stopped his chanting to
ask the boy a question. Once, when Ore could not respond
properly, the father struck him across his face with the back
of his hand. A red mark appeared on Ore's cheek, and tears
came.
Jim had expected, for some reason, that Ore would look
like him. He did not. His body was stockier, and his arms
seemed longer. His nose was snub, his lips fuller than Jim's,
his chin less pronounced, and his hair was black. Moreover,
the eyes were wider and gave him a look of innocence.
He wore no clothing except a blue headband printed with
symbols unfamiliar to Jim. One looked like a trumpet of some
sort. Did that represent the Horn of Shambarimem, which Jim
had read about in the series and which was supposed to open
all gates among the worlds when it was blown?
Now, the father and the mother slowly began to circle the
child counterclockwise. Los continued to swing the censer,
and he questioned his son only when he was in front of him.
Jim could see the boy tighten up when this happened.
Twice, he responded successfully. The third time, he
stammered. Again, the father struck his son on the face.
The woman frowned and opened her mouth as if to say
something to her husband. But she closed her lips. Los
95
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
shouted something. Perhaps the anger was required by the
ceremony, but it seemed to be far more personal than ritual-
istic.
Ore quivered. His face and body shone with sweat, and
his lower lip trembled. His signs of stress seemed to make
Los more furious.
Jim hated the father.
Though he had come here to enter Ore and to be one with
him, he hesitated. His sympathetic anger was making his
mind whirl, and he needed all the coolness and self-control
he could master to be able to enter Ore. That step was
frightening enough. He had no way of knowing, of course,
but he felt that he could err during the incorporation
procedure and find himself in a very bad situation.
The father, whose face had been getting redder and more
twisted, swung the censer hand against the side of Ore's head.
The boy went down to his knees. Both of his arms remained
down. Jim guessed that, if the boy had moved his arms, he
would completely fail to fulfill his part in the ceremony. What
the result of that would be, Jim did not know.
The woman said something. Los glared at her and spoke
one word. The woman glared back and spoke one word. Jim
did not think that they were complimenting each other.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (63 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Ore rose unsteadily to his feet. He stared upward while
blood trickled from the wound. Tears swept down his
cheeks, but he had locked his jaws together.
Enitharmon shrieked. She sprang toward Los and swung
the end of her wand against the side of Los's head.
She certainly did not react as his mother would, Jim
thought.
Then he was whisked away, up out of the temple, up
above the mountains, the continent, the planet, the sun,
back to the gate to his room on Earth, and through the gate
with a soundless explosion.

CHAPTER 1 4
November 8, 1979
VA/HEN JIM ENTERED the next time, he did not see the scary,
intersecting, glowing, and many-dimensional walls. In-
stead, he was confronted by a great swarm of figures that
alternately flashed green and red. They looked like sperma-
tozoa with human faces, all grinning malignantly at him.
He flew through the horde, those in his path wriggling
swiftly away, and was quickly in Ore's universe. But,
before he had started chanting, he had decided to enter Ore
when he was seventeen years old.
The youth was in a forest hundreds of miles beyond the
city. Ore had grown into a tall and very muscular young
man. He was standing behind the massive bole of a tree, his
left hand grasping the shaft of a spear. He wore a blue cap
shaped like Robin Hood's. A scarlet feather stuck out of its
side. Except for the cap, a short blue kilt, and sandals, he
97
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
wore nothing. A belt held a scabbarded short-sword and a
bolstered throwing ax. It was an hour or so into the
afternoon. The sky, crimson today, was clear, and the sun,
also crimson, blazed down on top of the forest. It was,
however, cool below the thick canopy of vegetation con-
necting trees seven hundred feet high.
The layer of tangled plants far above him held a multitude
of insects, birds, and animals. From a branch fifty feet
above him, a raccoonlike creature with a green beard hung
by its prehensile tail and scolded him. Ore was listening
intently to something, but it would have been difficult to
hear anything above the uproar of the forest life.
Ore turned his head. His father, Los, and his mother,
Enitharmon, had appeared from the shadows of the trees
behind him. His parents were clad only in kilts and sandals,
and they, too, carried weapons. Though Los had a spear and an
ax, he was armed also with a bulbous-ended handgun, a beamer.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (64 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Jim was again suffering from fear. To project himself into
Ore's mind and possibly never get out again was to dare a
danger such as he had never encountered before. But he had
to do it or live as a coward forever after. Do or die. And
maybe die, anyway. Worse, be absorbed by Ore or be only
partially absorbed but forever a prisoner in that alien body.
Never mind. Get into Ore's mind. Become partly Ore.
Not completely Ore, dear God!
It was done. For a second or more, he seemed to have
fallen into a silo of wet oats. Slimy and squidgy matter
pressed around him. He was blind. The darkness and the
loathsome substance drowning him came close to making
him turn back. He gritted his figurative teeth and shouted
voicelessly at himself, "Go on!"
The frightening muck was behind him, though the
darkness remained. He had a sensation of plunging into a
furiously running stream of a mercury-heavy liquid, of
98
RED ORC'S RAGE
being shot through many winding and twisting tunnels, and
of hearing a noise like that of the beating of giant wings or
a vast heart.
That was behind him. Now, he floated in a silent
chamber. Then, he heard a faint crackling. Sparks showered
around him.
Suddenly, the sparks expanded and coalesced. They
became a bright light. He could see and hear and smell and
taste as he had in his body on Earth.
He was enfleshed and enbrained, almost entirely Ore. He
was like a tiny parasite hanging on to its host's artery wall and
hoping that it would not be swept away by the raging current
of blood. Meanwhile, it tapped into its host's nervous system
and shared all thoughts, memories, emotions, and sensations.
That one-way input was, as he was to find out, very
confusing for him. It would take some time to be able to
handle at the same time his own thoughts and identity and
Ore's.
Ore saw his Uncle Luvah and Aunt Vala as they came from
the shadows of the trees. Behind them walked a dozen natives,
slaves of the Lords, trackers and beaters. They were somewhat
darker than the Lords but only because they spent more time in
the sunlight. They wore loincloths, were heavily tattooed, and
bristled with feathers stuck in their long dark hair and in holes
in their ears. Their only weapons were bamboo air guns which
expelled darts with anesthetic-coated tips. Their leader carried
a signal horn made from the doubly curving horn of a giant
bovoid animal.
Los's voice was deep and growling.
"Any luck, son?"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (65 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

"I think one of them is holed up in that cluster ofshinthah
trees," Ore said. "He's been wounded. I've trailed him
partly by his blood, though he doesn't seem to be bleeding
heavily."
99
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
"He must be the one who killed the two slaves," Los said.
"The others are all accounted for, dead or gotten away."
Jim was vaguely amazed that he could understand the
speech of the Lords, or Thoan, their name for themselves.
If his reaction was diluted, it was because all his own
feelings were, so far, shadowy. But everything funneled
through to him from Ore was bright and hard.
Luvah and Vala moved up to stand beside Los. They had
been invited by Ore's parents to be their guests at the palace
and to go on a manhunt. Los had opened the gates between
their worlds long enough for them to pass through.
Los would never have done that on his own. His wife had
insisted that Luvah of the Horses and his wife and sister,
Vala, be invited. Enitharmon needed more than the com-
pany of her family and slaves.
Ore adored the beautiful and warm-natured Vala. As it
turned out, though, he had been kept too busy to talk to her.
The hunt had been furious and intense and had few pauses.
Los said, "Is the man still armed?"
"I don't know," Ore said.
All the quarry were natives who had been sentenced to
death by their own people for serious crimes. Los had
decided to override the sentences and use the convicted as
prey. He did this now and then when he got bored with other
amusements. Seven men, all dangerous, had been taken to
this jungle, given spears and knives, and let loose. After
twenty minutes of waiting, the Lords and their retainers had
started tracking them. The Lords were, except for Los and
Vala, armed only with primitive weapons. That ensured that
the hunt would be dangerous for the hunters. Ore's father
and his aunt carried the beamers to shoot any beasts of prey
that might attack the party or a human quarry if he got the
upper hand in a fight with a Lord. Manhunt rules, as
100
determined by tradition, were never broken. Or, if a Lord
had broken them, he or she had kept quiet about it.
"Who wants to go after the beast?" Los shouted.
"I will be happy to do it," Ore said. He was aware that
he had volunteered because he wanted to get his father's
respect even though he did not like his father. Also, a
stronger reason, he wanted to show off before his aunt.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (66 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"It's true that you do need more practice," Los said. "You
haven't killed many beasts yet, man or animal. But it's only
polite to allow our visitors first chance. Remember that."
Vala said, "I'd love to see Ore in action. I'll be right
behind you, nephew."
Jim was thinking, My God! They're callous enough
about it! And cool, too! What kind of people are these? He
knew, however, from reading the Tiersian books just how
cruel the Lords could be. What had he expected?
Despite his repulsion, he was feeling Ore's emotions.
The youthful Lord and, therefore, Jim, was excited and
eager. At the same time. Ore, therefore Jim, was hoping
that he would not make a fool of himself. It was possible
that he would also be a dead fool.
Ore walked slowly into the denseness of the shinthah
trees. Their branches, which began about six feet above the
earth, merged with those of their neighbors. Vines crawled
through the branches and let down loops close to the
ground. Moreover, the winshin bush, a very leafy plant,
grew among the trees. The tangle of tree, vine, and bush
was ideal for hiding and ambushing.
Holding his spear in one hand, Vala about six feet behind
him. Ore plunged into the thick growth. He moved slowly
to avoid making noise. He was very tense and was sweating
heavily. It suddenly came to him that the quarry had most of
the advantages. He stopped when his foot struck something.
He looked down. Half-buried in some kind of weedy
101
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
growth was a spear. The hunted man had dropped it. Which
must mean that he was badly wounded.
Despite this. Ore did not forget to be cautious. It was
possible that the man had placed the spear there to make the
hunter think just what Ore had thought. He might be waiting
close by, his hunting knife in his hand.
He gestured at Vala to indicate the spear. She nodded that
she understood.
Though the cluster would usually be clamorous with the
cries of birds and beasts, it was silent now. The tenants were
watching the intruders, waiting to see if they were danger-
ous before resuming normal activity.
Ore parted a bush with his right hand and looked past it
and down. There was the prey. He was a big man com-
pletely unclothed and lying on his back. By his open hand
was a large knife. Blood flowed slowly from under the hand
held to his shoulder. Sweat had washed all but traces of the
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (67 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
blood from his torso and legs.
Ore said, "Har?"
Not until then had he known that the quarry was from a
village near the palace-city or that he was his half brother.
Los had many children by the native women; Har was one
of perhaps a hundred. He was a superb tracker who had
taught Ore everything he knew about jungle craft. He had
been wounded by his own father, Los, who was separated
from the group when he had thrown his spear on glimpsing
the quarry. Later, Ore had come across Har's trail of blood.
The man was pale under his heavy tan. He stared at Ore,
knowing that he was about to die. But he did not plead.
Vala came up to Ore. She said, "You must blood your
knife, nephew. It is not correct to finish him off with your
spear. Wait until I call the others. They must see you do it."
Jim felt Ore's sudden sickness. He knew what Ore was
thinking. He would have to cut Har's throat and lick some
702
RED ORC'S RAGE
of the blood off the knife. The coup de grace and the blood
tasting were not new to him, nor did he find them
distasteful. Far from it. But this . . . ! He knew and liked
his half brother as much as he could like any leblabbiy, as
the non-Lords were called. He told himself that he would
sooner kill his father than he would Har.
But he had to do it. Not only that, he must not show any
pity or kindness. By then, the others had arrived. Los said,
"So, it was Har I wounded! And you get the credit for the
kill! Well, that is the way things sometimes happen!"
"You wounded him, father," Ore said. "I couldn't have
caught him if you hadn't. Why don't you lick his blood?"
Los frowned, and he said, "That isn't the Thoan way. Go
ahead."
Ore went around the bush, scraping his skin against the
abrasive leaves of that bush and the one beside it. The other
Lords followed him. The natives stayed behind and would
do so unless ordered to witness the killing.
Har's eyes were dulled. Yet, he was not so far gone that
he did not recognize Ore. He croaked, "Greeting, brother!"
He had never said that word to Ore during all their
conversations. Though both knew that Los was their father,
neither would ever say so. If Har had dared to do that, he
would have been punished severely, perhaps with death.
Now that he was to die, he did not care.
"You are immortal or nearly so," Har said. "Yet, you can be
killed. That makes you my brother no matter who our father is."
A shiver of fire ran through Ore. He was struck, not with
the audacity of Har but with the truth of his words. They
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (68 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

were as frightening as lightning in the night when there was
no cloud or thunder.
"Go ahead. Ore!" Los said.
Ore turned to face him. "I cannot do it," he said.
Los was not the only one who stepped back as if suddenly
smelling a carcass long rotten.
103
PHILIP JOSE FARMER RED ORC'S RAGE
Los shook his head, blinked, and said harshly, "I do not
understand. Is something wrong?"
Ore took a deep breath before speaking. Only Jim knew
what courage Ore had to summon for what he was about to do.
"I cannot kill him. He is flesh of my flesh. He is your son
and my brother."
Everything around Ore seemed to be fuzzy. The harsh
edges of reality were blunted and soft. He felt as if he had
stepped into another world that was not quite formed.
Los looked bewildered. He said, "What? What does that
have to do with it?"
Vala turned and gestured at the head tracker, Sheon, to
approach her. As all non-Lords did when called by a Thoan,
he came swiftly.
"What is that man's crime?" Vala said, pointing at Har.
Sheon, looking at the ground, said, "Holy One, he slew a
son of our chief after he caught him in bed with his wife. Har
claimed that the chief's son attacked him with a knife, and he
killed him in self-defense. But Har's wife witnessed other-
wise. She said that Har meant to kill both of them. In any
event, Har should have gone to the council and presented his
complaint to it. It is against our law to slay a man or a woman
caught in adultery. Har could have run away if he was
attacked. There was nothing to stop him from running."
Vala turned to Ore. "See? He deserves to die by the law
of his own people."
"Then let them execute him," Ore said.
"This is ridiculous!" Los shouted. "You're stupid! I do
not understand you! He's not Thoan!"
"He's half-Thoan," Ore said calmly, though he was far
from calm inside himself.
"Half is not the whole!" Los said. His face was very red,
and his eyes were wild. "Kill him! At once!"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (69 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"Don't you feel anything for him?" Ore said. "He is your
son. Or does that mean nothing to you?"
Luvah said, "Nephew, you're out of your mind! What
happened? Did you have an accident, strike your head
against something?"
"Something struck me," Ore said. "It wasn't physical. It
was like a great light . . . it's hard to explain."
"I'll strike you!" Los howled, and his fist caught the side
of Ore's jaw. Ore was stunned for several seconds. When he
was able to think clearly, he found himself down on his
knees. The others, except for Los, looked as if they, too,
had been struck. Ore's mother murmured, "Los! This is not
necessary! There is something wrong with the boy!"
"Yes, there is, Enitharmon! He is not a true Lord! Did you
lie with some native and allow yourself to get pregnant?"
Enithermon gasped, and Vala said, "That is a terrible
thing to say!"
Ore was seized by something that was roaring. The sound
was red. Colors did not have sounds, but many things
happened in the mind that could not happen outside it. The
insult to his mother had loosed all the desires to attack his
father that had been caged since as far back as he could remember.
He was in a dream filled with a bright red light. He
seemed to be standing outside of himself and watching
himself. He saw Ore, the knife still in his hand despite
having been half-conscious, come off the ground quickly.
He saw Los step back, but not quickly enough to prevent the
blade driving several inches into his left arm. He saw his
uncle, Luvah, strike him on the side on his head with the
butt of his spear. He saw himself drop the knife and fall onto
his face but roll over so that he was faceup.
Then he was back inside himself. His father had raised
the spear held in his right hand to drive it through him. His
mother, screaming, grabbed the spear and struggled with
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Los. She wrested it from his grip and held it so that its point
was close to her husband.
"Don't do it!" she screamed. It was evident that she
would use the spear on him if he tried to kill her son.
Vala spoke in a high and tight voice. "Los! The leblabbiy
are watching you!"
Los turned and glared. Sheon, the chief tracker, was
walking back to his fellows. He did not want the Thoan to
know that he had seen the fight, but it was too late for that.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (70 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

Los pointed at Ore and said, "Bind him! He goes back to
the palace!"
He pulled his beamer from his holster. "Vala! Come with
me! We have to destroy them! I don't want them alive now
they've seen us trying to kill each other!"
Vala said, "I think Sheon was the only one who saw us.
He won't tell the others."
"I don't want to take the chance," Los said. "We don't
want them to think we're no better than they, do we?"
He wanted to kill someone. If he was restrained from
slaying his son, he would slaughter the leblabbiy. At
another time, he might have listened to Vala. But not now.
Vala bit her lip, but she said, "Very well." She walked
away with Los, her gun also drawn. As Ore discovered later,
the natives had guessed what the Lords planned to do. The
more passive and religious stayed to submit to their doom.
Four leblabbiy, however, fled into the forest. They would be
exiled forever from their tribe and would be men with a price
on their head, prey for another hunt by the Thoan.
Ore was turned over, and his wrists were bound together
with tape his mother brought out of a bag. While doing this,
his mother bent close to him and whispered, "Do not anger
your father again. I'll do my best to cool him down."
"He'll kill me," Ore said. "He hates me. He's always
hated me. What did I do to make him hate me. Mother?"

URC HAD BEEN stripped of his clothing and chained to a
boulder near the main palace. One end of the ten-foot-long
chain was attached to a steel plate secured to the giant
quartzite rock. The other end was fixed to a steel band
around his right ankle. For two days and nights, he had
suffered this humiliation and discomfort. The sun burned
him during most of the day. At night, Los allowed the
clouds to come into the levels. Ore slept poorly because of
the cold, wetness, and hard floor.
During the day, he ate one meal, brought by a servant.
She left him a bucket of water to drink and to bathe. When
he relieved bladder or bowels, he went around behind the
boulder as far as he could. He had no toilet paper or wash
rag. Once a day, a servant came to clean up the mess.
At high noon each day, his parents, aunt, and uncle had
come down from the palace. Los had asked him if he was
sorry that he had behaved so badly. Would he apologize and

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
then promise that he would never do such again and would
always obey his parents? Los added that even then his
punishment would not be over.
"There are many Lords who would slay their son on the
spot. But I do not wish to grieve your mother, and Luvah
and Vala have pleaded for you."
"You should not have struck me," Ore said.
"I am your father! I have the right and the duty to do so
when you deserve it!"
"You have struck me many times," Ore said. "I would
think that a man who is so many thousands of years old would
have some wisdom and love. You have learned nothing. Be
that as it may, you have struck me for the last time. You may
as well kill me."
Los turned and walked away, his long green robe
flapping, the tall yellow feather on his wide-brimmed hat
bobbing. His mother and his aunt stayed for a minute to beg
him to bend to his father's will.
"You are so stubborn," Enitharmon said as tears ran
down her cheek. "Your stubbornness will kill you. What
will I do if I lose my firstborn?"
"Kill Los, and so avenge me," Ore said. "I think you'd
like to do it, anyway. I do not know why you stay with him.
Aren't there other worlds you could go to? How about
Luvah's and Vala's?"
"You are determined to die," Enitharmon said. She
kissed him on the cheek and left. Luvah, shaking his head,
walked away. Vala lingered a moment.
"I'll sneak out tonight and bring you a sleeping bag and
something good to eat."
"Don't endanger yourself for me, though I thank you. At
least, you love me."
"Your mother does, too," Vala said. "You saw how she
defended you when Los was going to spear you. But her
708
RED ORC'S RAGE
character is such that she cannot stand up against Los unless
she's driven to it, and then it doesn't last long."

"You'd think that she could have changed her character
during the course of so many millennia. What good is the
Lords' science if it can't change undesirable character
traits?"
"There have been some who have changed themselves,
though not always for the better. But most people cannot
unfix their characters no matter how long they live. It's a
matter of will, not of biological engineering. Would you
allow yourself to be tampered with?"
She kissed him hard on his lips before leaving. Ore
suspected that Vala lusted for him as he did for her. Or was
she just a loving aunt, and had he, so young and inexperi-
enced, misread her affection?
He looked at his father, still striding toward the major
palace of the city of pylons. His son had seen more of the
back of his father than his face, though that was most times
the preferable side. Then he looked up at the third story of
the glittering gold-block-and-much-gemmed wall of the
palace. There, framed by a window, was his tutor, Noorosha.
He was an intelligent and highly educated native who had been
guiding Ore through programmed courses since the Lord was
three years old. Now, he was looking down at his student, who
should have been in class.
Ore waved at Noorosha, the person he loved most of all
except for his mother and aunt. Why couldn't his father be
like Noorosha?
The day passed, each minute like a whip stroke. While he
paced back and forth, the chain dragging on his leg and
clinking on the slightly roughened surface of the transparent
floor, his mind was pacing. Back and forth, back and forth
from thoughts of ways to escape to visions of killing his father.
Finally, night fell. The first moon rose. Two hours later,
709
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
the second lumbered up. Jim, looking through Ore's eyes,
estimated that it was half the size of Earth's moon. The first
moon was half the size of the second one. Their markings,
of course, were different from the one Jim knew.
After the clouds oozed over Ore, he lay down on the
floor. It took him a long time to fall asleep. Jim also slept
then. It seemed like a short time had passed when Vala's
touch awoke Ore and, of course, Jim.
She was a dim figure crouching by him. "I've brought the
bag and food," she said softly. "But I've brought more than
that."
She held up an object that he could not see clearly.
"A beamer. Hold still. I'm going to cut your chain."
"You shouldn't do that!" Ore said. "I thank you, but I
can't allow you to endanger yourself. My father will

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
investigate thoroughly if I escape, and he'll find out you did
it, and he'll kill you!"
"Not if you kill him first," she said.
She started to rise. Ore heard a thud. She grunted and
pitched forward, falling heavily across his legs. Above Ore
loomed a vague shape, but he knew that it was Los. Vala,
groaning, rolled over Ore's legs, a hand pressing the back of
her head. Then she started to rise.
"Stay down, you treacherous slut!" Los said.
Just beyond Ore's father was a vague and bulky figure. It
looked to Ore like a vehicle of some sort.
"I should kill you, Vala!" Los shouted. "But I can
understand why you felt sorry for him, believe it or not!
After all, he is my son, though not much of one! I can
remember how I loved him when he was a baby! But you
have betrayed my hospitality! How do I know that you
weren't planning on letting him help you kill me!"
He raved on, the gist being that, because he was
merciful, he was permitting Vala and her husband to return
7/0
RED ORC'S RAGE
to their universe. But they would do it at once and under
guard. He would deal with his son, though they would
never find out how he would do it. She would never see him
again.
Vala started to protest. He screamed at her to shut up or
he would shoot her on the spot. After that, she said nothing
except to murmur, "I'm sorry. Ore." Los kept on ranting in
the same manner for about five minutes. When he stopped,
he bent over Vala and jammed the end of a cylinder into her
arm. She collapsed immediately. Then he stuck the end
against Ore's chest. He became unconscious and so did Jim.
Jim awoke at the same moment as Ore. Bright sunlight
made Ore squint and, in a shadowy way, Jim also. The
young Thoan was sitting on bare buttocks on a rock ledge.
He was propped up against a vertical outcropping of stone.
His hands were tied together behind him with rope. The
ledge ended a foot beyond him. Below it was a precipitous
slope of mountain, forested halfway down. At the bottom
was a river snaking through an unbroken forest. Another
mountain was on the other side of the river.
The sky was blue, which meant that he was not in his
native world. Not unless he had been unconscious long
enough to let two days pass.
Despite the blazing sun, he shivered from the cold air.
There were patches of snow on the upper face of the
mountain opposite him. He looked around then and saw that
he was in a cave extending back from the ledge. Near him
on the dirt floor was a square plastic sheet.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (74 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

He walked to the sheet, lowered himself to his knees, and
bent over to look at the plastic piece. As he had expected,
it bore his father's handwriting.
You are on Anthema, the unwanted world. If you
are man enough to survive on it and find your way to
///
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
the only other gate on this world, you may be able to
get out of it. I give you a clue though you do not
deserve it. The gate will be near a landmark resem-
bling something you are wearing. But you will have
to find the code allowing you to open the gate. That
gate leads back to your own world.
You only have to look for the gate on land, which
cuts the territory of your search down to fifty million
square miles. Though I should wish you bad luck, I
do not. May you get what you deserve.
Ore groaned. Anthema, the Unwanted World! Made by
those mysterious beings who had existed before the Lords,
who had made the original universe of the Lords and then
created the Lords to populate it. Anthema was so crudely
constructed that the Lords theorized that it had been the
pre-Thoan's first experiment in making artificial universes.
No Lord had chosen to live there. Indeed, very few knew
how to gate to it.
Los must have put him in that vehicle and carried him to
a gate in the palace or somewhere on his world. Then he had
gated the vehicle with himself and Ore in it to this world.
After arriving at Anthema via the interdimensional route,
Los had used the vehicle to fly from the gate to this cave.
And what was that about the clue being provided by
something his son was wearing? Ore was naked.
It was then that he felt the necklace and the object
attached to it.
He heaved himself up onto his feet. Now he could bend
his neck and see the object, which rested just below his
breastbone. Though it was upside down from his viewpoint,
he could recognize it. It was a round gold medallion, one of
his father's, bearing a name, Shambarimem, and, below
that, a raised relief of the Horn—a trumpet—of that
7/2
RED ORC'S RAGE
legendary man. It was as close to a religious medal as a
Thoan artifact could come.
What kind of a clue was that? A mountain that looked
like the Horn? Ore, knowing his father's subtle nature, was
sure that it was not as simple as that. In fact, the clue might
not even be visual. Never mind. First, he had to get his
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (75 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
hands free.
That was done, though not soon. He went to the tiny
monolith he had been sitting against, turned around, and
bent his knees. He raised his arms, squatted even more, and
set the rope on the rather blunt edge of a small ridge on top
of the rock and near its side. The position was both tiring
and painful, but he kept sawing until the rope was halfway
worn through. After resting, he resumed the sawing. When
he felt the rope part, he brought his hands before him and
untied each with the other hand, no easy task. After
reconnoitering the cave and finding nothing to indicate a
gate, he surveyed the valley. The only life he saw consisted
of some strange-looking and awkward flying creatures.
He started climbing down the steep slope below the
ledge. He had no reason to feel optimistic in this world
certainly not made for him. His fury and desire for revenge
would keep him going for a long time. But he could search
the vast territory for a thousand years and still not find the
landmark and the gate within or on or under or by it. He
might even see the landmark and not know that it was what
he was looking for.
He had troubles. Oh, Shambarimem, did he have trou-
bles!
They came sooner than he expected. A loud shriek
behind him froze him for a fraction of a second. A blow on
his back knocked him forward. He heard giant wings
beating. Pain as of very sharp and large claws stabbing his
back made him scream.
113
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim Grimson was also startled. He heard the shriek, felt
the hard impact, and yelled from the agony.
The shock was too much for him. He was whisked out,
up, and away far more swiftly than his previous journeys
back to Earth. He awoke sitting on the chair in his room. He
was shivering and sweating and somewhat numb. For a
moment, the searing on his back from the terrible claws
stayed with him. Then it faded.
Despite his fear, he would have tried to get back into Ore
if his energy had not been completely dynamited out of him.
It was a long time before he could rise from the chair.

CHAPTER 1 6
I ODAY, THE GROUP session members were even more
inclined to argue than usual. Their digs were sharper, and
they took offense more quickly. Was there something in the
air like itching powder? Or was it that they had reached a
certain stage in their therapy where their anger and frustra-
tion were closer to the surface? These were burrowing
upward toward the skin like worms chased out of the
intestine by strong medicine.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (76 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Gillman Sherwood, the nineteen-year-old from Gold
Hill, was getting more abuse than usual. Some of the group
detested and distrusted him because his family was wealthy.
Until now, he had responded with a slight smile and silence
to the onslaught. That he would not defend himself made
his attackers even more angry.
Foremost among them was Al Moober, a sixteen-year-old
who had never had any money until he had started dealing
in drugs. His career had lasted six months. Then the cops
7/5
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
had caught him. But he had been accused of being under the
influence and of possession, not of selling. He especially
had it in for Sherwood, one of his former customers,
because he suspected that Sherwood had turned him in to
the narcs.
Sherwood's wrists were still bandaged from the deep
slashes made when he had tried suicide. He had wanted to
be a painter, but his parents had opposed that ambition.
Both had agreed, when their son was only three years old,
that he would go to Ohio State for his undergraduate
education and then to Harvard for his law degree. After six
months at Ohio, he had a "nervous breakdown." He came
out of the sanitarium three months later, went home, and
refused to consider going back to college. His parents had
kept up their pressure despite their doctor's warnings. One
night, Sherwood had used the blood from his wrist arteries
to paint a nightmare vision on his palette. He had ended up
in Porsena's Tiersian therapy group.
Moober had also told his fellow patients that Sherwood
was bisexual and had added that Sherwood had made a pass
at him. The girls thought that Sherwood was divinely
handsome and looked much like a tall Paul Newman.
Besides, he had made passes at several of them, and why
would he go for a loathsome creature like Moober?
Moober had persisted in trying to invalidate Sherwood's
descriptions of his adventures as Wolff, the hero Sherwood
had chosen to emulate. Doctor Scaevola, today's group
leader, had tried to stop Moober from doing this, but
Moober would not quit. Then Scaevola had told Moober
that he would obey the rules or be sent to his room to think
about how he would like being kicked out of the therapy.
Moober had quit attacking Sherwood, though he was
muttering to himself.
Jim Grimson was only half listening to the others. For
116
RED ORC'S RAGE
one thing, he had been shocked when he had seen Sandy
Melton this morning. She was sitting at the far end of the
dining hall with the group of mild schizoaffectives. Until
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (77 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
then, Jim had not known that Sandy was in the hospital. He
had heard nothing about what had happened to her after that
evening at Dumski's.
He had waved to her. She had smiled at him and resumed
talking to the girl next to her. Jim planned to talk to her
when he got the chance.
Another reason Jim had trouble concentrating was that he
could not keep from wondering about what had happened to
Ore after Jim had left him. His plight and his world seemed
more real than this room and the people in it. These people
did not know what real trouble was.
He became aware that Doctor Scaevola was speaking to
him and that the others were looking at him.
"Your turn, Jim," Scaevola said. "We're all eager to hear
what happened during your latest exploration."
Jim doubted they all were that eager. Most of them were
too wrapped up in their own sojourns to care much about
his. Or, at least, he thought that they were. He had learned
something about himself in the short time he had been here.
That was that he often attributed his own feelings to others,
but there was often no match between the two. He must be
more careful in the future not to assign to others his own
thoughts and emotions.
Group therapy was supposed to be in some respects like
a book club. The members would talk about various
characters in the series and how they felt about them. They
would then tell how they would have changed the situations
or the endings in the books. Also, they commented on how
each person's chosen character reflected the personality and
the problems of the chooser. This interplay, however, was
closely monitored by the group leader. It was not allowed to
117
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
get to a point where the members were criticizing each other
too harshly.
One of the difficulties the members had, at this stage in
therapy, was in giving full information about their experi-
ences in the pocket universes. Jim shared this reluctance.
Now, in answering Scaevola's invitation, he gave only the
sketchiest outline of his adventures. He held back because it
seemed to him that they should be very private. Somehow,
if the others got too far into Ore's world, they would try to
take over. His fellow patients would want his worlds just as
the Lords desired the worlds of other Lords.
Moreover, Jim was convinced that the universes the other
members entered into were purely imaginary. Though vivid
and very detailed, they were nevertheless just fantasies. He
did not reveal this to the group, of course. To do so would
be to invalidate the worlds of his fellow patients.
Jim finished his somewhat halting and hesitant tale. Even
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (78 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
as he spoke, he began to feel that it was made up. The
others seemed to be looking doubtfully at him. Damn! They
were invalidating him!
Monique Bragg, a black girl, said, "Your father, I mean
Ore's father, struck you. Ore, a number of times. That
sounds like your own father, Jim. He's unpredictable and
confusing, too, just like Los, the way he treats you. Cruel
and severe a lot of times but, sometimes, kind and tender,
like a real father should be. That's bewildering to a kid."
"Which father you talking about?" Jim said. "My father
in this world or the father in the other world?"
Monique smiled, revealing big white teeth. "Both, you
dummy. Only this Los isn't like your real father in some
ways. He's a very handsome and powerful person, lord and
master of all he surveys, you might say, not a worthless
drunken bum like your real father."
118
RED ORC'S RAGE
"Monique!" Doctor Scaevola said softly but firmly.
"Please refrain from personal remarks."
"Sure, Doc," Monique said. "Only ... I didn't say
anything about his father he hasn't said. I was just pointing
out certain things, how Los and this woman. Ore's
mother—Enitharmon?—resemble his own parents. They
sort of reflect them, don't you think? That's what this is all
about, anyway, isn't it? How this world and the Tiersian are
mirror images, wasn't that what you said? Distorted mir-
rors."
"That's an aspect," Scaevola said, "but we don't want to
dwell too much on parallelisms, especially those that're
rather obvious. Unless you're leading up to another point?"
"Maybe it's the differences that're most important,"
Monique said. "Like Ore's mother seems to be under Los's
thumb just as Jim's mother is. But she's beautiful and
powerful, and she can stand up to him. To a point, anyway.
Maybe she's going to rebel, even kill Los. That's something
your mother'd never do, right, Jim? But maybe you're
hoping she will some day. Is that so, Jim?"
"How would I know?" Jim said heatedly. "I'm not
making this up, you know! Things'11 go the way they go,
not how I think they should go!"
There was silence for a moment except for Moober's
brief snicker.
Then Scaevola said, "Of course! Remember, we're not
writing stories. These things really do happen. Whether
they exist inside your mind or outside your mind, they exist.
A thought is as much an existent as a, uh . . ."
"A fart!" Moober said loudly and doubled up with
laughter.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (79 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"Both evanescent but nevertheless existing in their own
moment of glory or putridness," Scaevola said.
"Hey, there are millions of fathers and mothers more or
119
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
less like mine on Earth," Jim said. "So, there are some in
the Lords' worlds. Nothing strange about it. Quit the
psychologizing, for Christ's sake."
Brooks Epstein spoke up for the first time during the
session. He was a tall, dark, and lean youth who wore thick
hom-rimmed glasses. Though he was from Gold Hill, he
had escaped the insults and disdain cast at Sherwood.
Epstein's father had been wealthy, but he had gone bankrupt
and then killed himself. Epstein's mother had just enough
insurance to place her son in therapy at Wellington Hospi-
tal.
"Quit psychologizing?" he said. "I thought we were here
to do just that!"
"We're here to get therapy, get well, not sit around and
analyze each other until we fall apart," Jim said. "Analyz-
ing is like disassembling. We'll never put the pieces back
together. Humpty Dumpty himself, you know."
"Thank you, Doctor Freud," Epstein said. "Any-
way ..."
The group broke up with almost everybody mad at
everybody else. Doctor Scaevola tried to patch the rents and
wounds and cool off their tempers before the session ended.
This time, his soft words, reasonableness, and compromise
had not worked. Some of the group were, so far, too timid
to dare offend anybody. Others were inclined to be nasty,
and the characters they had chosen to merge with were
arrogant and ill-tempered. The staff members had to put the
lid on these patients now and then. At the same time, they
had to keep from suppressing the youths so much that they
erupted out of control or were in danger of losing their
Tiersian identities.
No matter how pugnaciously and offensively the mem-
bers behaved, they were putting up a front. All had low
self-esteem, a crippling part of their own personae. To gain
120
RED ORC'S RAGE
a genuine self-esteem was one of the goals of the therapy
but hard to achieve. To think of themselves as worthwhile,
they had to become somebody else for a while.
A few minutes after the session, Jim was told that he had
a visitor, Sam Wyzak. Doctor Scaevola was not available
just then, so Doctor Tarchuna had to give permission for
Jim to see Sam. He sent it through the phone in his office.
Eager, Jim strode to the small lobby reserved for visitors. A
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (80 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
male nurse, Dave Gurscom, stood in the doorway and
watched them.
Sam rose from the chair when Jim entered the room. He
smiled broadly and advanced toward his friend, his arms
waving. They met in the middle of the room and embraced.
Jim was very glad to see him, but he could not help
wrinkling his nose at Sam's odor. Since Jim had been in the
hospital, he had been showering daily and had sent out his
dirty laundry to his mother. He said nothing to Sam about
his unwashed body and clothes. After all, the clothes Jim
was now wearing had been donated by Sam. Without them,
he would have been clad only in hospital-provided pajamas,
a robe, and slippers.
Sam lost his smile after they quit embracing. He sat down
heavily on the chair.
"Jim, I got some things to say to you, got to get some
things clear. There's a thing I got to do, and you won't like
it. Or maybe you will, I don't know. But I've come to an
impasse, as they say. Gotta go but don't really want to."
"Go where?"
"To California. Hollywood, to be exact. Gotta get the
hell out of this cruddy place, the armpit of the universe. I'm
in a bad fix. I'm in a rehab center for chemical dependents,
for dope fiends, as my father says. The courts're on my
neck. The judge says I gotta straighten out, he don't want
me flunking, no way. He gets weekly reports from my folks
121
PHtLIP JOSE FARMER
and the school, and they just aren't good enough. I'm still
flunking my ass though I am trying hard to bring my grades
up."
He put his fingers over his eyes and looked at Jim through
the spaces among his fingers as if they were prison bars. His
voice got shaky.
"Jim, I can't take no more of this! I'm running off to
California, gonna disappear, really drop out. I don't know
what the hell I'll do there, become a street person, most
likely. For a while, anyway. I'll be taking my guitar,
though. I might get into a band. Maybe not. I ain't what
you'd call a great musician, but that never stopped lots of
rock stars. Anyway, I'm going to try for it. Anything'll be
better than what I'm doing now."
Jim was silent for a minute. Sam had dropped his hands
onto his lap, but his black eyes were zeroed in on Jim's
face. He seemed to be hoping that . . . what? That his old
buddy would utter wise words that would rescue him?
Jim waved his hand. It was a vague gesture that indicated
nothing except possibly hopelessness. What could he, Jim
Grimson, incarcerated in a mental ward, wearing borrowed
clothes, estranged from just about everybody he could name
except for Doctor Porsena and a few patients, the connec-
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (81 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
tions with them not really tight, what could he do for his old
friend?
He could not help thinking about his own plans, too,
though he felt like a big prick worrying about himself when
Sam was in such a bad situation. Sam had told him on the
phone several days ago that he could live at the Wyzaks'
when he became an outpatient. He and Sam would share the
bedroom and Sam's clothes and eat at Sam's table. Mrs.
Wyzak, big-hearted as ever, had made the offer. She knew
that Jim's parents were in a very small apartment and had no
money to help support their son. Jim's eighteenth birthday
722
RED ORC'S RAGE
was coming up soon. After that, the welfare money allotted
for him would be cut off. Besides, Eric Grimson did not
want Jim to live with him.
Now that Sam was taking off, would his parents still take
his friend in?
Jim cleared his throat and said, "You're not talking to the
wise old man on top of the mountain, the ancient guru who
sees all, knows all, who can set you on the right path to
health, wealth, and fame. I'm sorry, Sam, but I don't know
what to say except to wish you luck. I could tell you to sign
up for Doctor Porsena's therapy. But he's got a long waiting
list. I was luckier than hell to be admitted so quickly."
Sam did not reply. His face was unreadable. But Jim
thought that he detected reproach and fright in it.
"Jesus, Sam, I want to help you! But I just can't!"
Sam said, "I didn't expect nothing from you. You can't
ask a drowning man to save you from drowning. I just
thought I'd tell you what I'm going to do. I wasn't asking
for your blessing."
"Damn, Sam! I feel like shit! I'm failing you!"
"What the hell," Sam said. He rose from the chair.
"Mom won't refuse you even if I'm not there. In fact, she'll
probably be gladder than ever to have you. Mothering's her
big thing, you know. That and bossing people around."
His voice broke. Tears oozed out and slid down to the
comers of his mouth. "Jesus, when we were kids together,
pretty happy, you know, even though things were tough a
lot of times, we couldn't have dreamed that we'd turn out
like this."
Jim could think of nothing better to do than to enfold Sam
in his arms and pat his back. That was all he could do, and
maybe it was enough. Sam sobbed for a moment, then
released himself and wiped the tears with a dirty handker-
chief.

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"Hey, Jim! We think we're grown up and don't need
nobody, right! But when the chips are down, as the buffalo
hunter said, we turn out to still be babies. I admit I'm a little
scared. Why not? I'm just kidding myself when I pretend to
be as tough as fried shoe leather. I wouldn't tell this to
anyone but you, Jim. I don't really want to leave. Things've
gotten too rough, though. It's adios, Belmont City! Cali-
fornia, here I come! Mom's going to cry her heart out, but
maybe, deep down, she'll be glad to get rid of me. She
won't have to be on my neck all the time because I'm such
a pain in the ass to her."
"Do you think you could keep in touch with me, write me
a postcard now and then?"
"If I can steal a postcard and a pencil," Sam said. "I
won't have much money."
He laughed, and he said, "Hey, it might be a lot better
than I think! California's the golden state, ingots of gold
laying around on the streets, ice cream cones growing from
trees, starlets just aching to lay a skinny, penniless, dumb
Polack. At least I won't freeze my ass off out on the street
come winter. And even the garbage cans'll have food better
than what I eat here."
"Maybe you should think more about it," Jim said.
"Look before you leap, and all that."
Something came over Jim then. His words of caution
suddenly seemed to be those of a coward. It was as if an
electrical current running through him had reversed itself
and was now running in the opposite direction.
He said, "What the hell, Sam! I don't mean that! It'll be
a great adventure! It'll at least be different! Better to live
like a lion for a day than like a dog forever! You know for
sure you have no future here! Go to California! It'll be
exciting, and it'll give you hope and endless opportunities!
I wish I could go with you!"
RED ORC'S RAGE
Sam blinked as if Jim had disappeared in a blinding light.
He said, "What happened to you?" Then, "Why don't you
come with me?"
Jim shook his head. "I would . . . only ..."
"Only what?"
"You'd have to be in my skin to know how I feel about
this place, what I'm doing. This is my adventure, Sam, this
ward. It's a world in itself, a world that ..."
How could he explain to Sam about the universes of the
Lords and his adventures as Red Ore? How could he make
Sam understand that golden California was lead compared
to the places he had been and to which he would return? No
way would Sam comprehend it.

"You always were a little strange, Jim, even though we
got along great. What the hell could this puzzle farm have
for you? For me, anyway. It'd be nothing."
He held out his hand. "So long, Jim. Hope we meet again
some other place, a better place, too."
Jim shook his hand. That Sam had offered it instead of
embracing him again meant that Sam had already distanced
himself. He no longer felt as close to Jim. They were very
good friends who had begun to be strangers.
Jim felt sick. That, however, was the way it had to be.
Character determined destiny. His had sent him off on a
different road from Sam's. It would have happened sooner
or later, anyway. It had come sooner, that was all.
Nevertheless, he felt very sad. He also regretted that he
had told Sam that he would be better off opting for
adventure. Immediately after thinking this, he changed his
mind, and much of the sadness and all of the regret
vanished. It really was best for Sam, for anyone, to leave
the familiar and to venture into strange country. That is, if
the familiar was a place where hopeless hardship and
unconquerable failure reigned.
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Sam said, "Talk to my mother. She'll take you in when
you need a home. You'll have to put up with a lot from her,
but you won't starve to death. Just do what she tells you to
do."
Sam turned and walked out without a backward look.
Jim called, "Good luck! I'll be with you in my thoughts,
Sam!"
Sam did not reply.
CHAPTER 1 7

AAAGH!"
The cry of the thing attacking Ore and Ore's cry mingled.
Locked together, they were rolling and bouncing down the
rocky face of the mountain. Ore had fallen onto his face,
taking his attacker with him. Then he had rolled over. The
creature had been under him for a moment. It had huge
wings, a small body, a very long thin neck, and a head twice
as large as his. Its beak was as hooked and as sharp as an
eagle's. Its legs were exceedingly long for a flying creature.
The claws were long, sharp, and curved, but they tore loose
after their second rollover.
Despite its birdlike appearance, it had no feathers.
The two, three if Jim was counted, rolled and slid and
soared down the slope. Both attacker and attacked were
banged and bunged and gashed, and both cried out from
pain. Then they slammed into the base of a boulder and
stopped. Fortunately for Ore, the creature was between him
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (84 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

and the rock when they crashed into it. Its body bones
snapped; its wing bones had already cracked during the
tumble.
Ore tried to get up so that he could seize the bird-animal
around its skinny neck and break it. He was unable to do so.
But the thing was also half-paralyzed. Its legs kicked, and
it swayed its snakelike neck while its beak opened and shut,
clack-clacking. After a minute or so, its enormous yellow
eyes glazed, and it was dead.
Ore lay for a long time while the sun slid on its arc across
the blue. He saw two creatures like his attacker above him.
They were circling, their heads cocked to observe him. He
hoped that he could get up before they decided that it was
safe for them to land and dine on him. Meanwhile, as long
as he was not in danger, he would take his ease. If ease
could be called a state in which he hurt everywhere. He had
lost skin from many parts of his body, including the private,
and what was not scraped away was nearly so. Also, his
head, knees, elbows, toe bones, ears, lips, nose, chin, and
genitals had been battered many times. The pain in his head
told him that he could have a concussion.
"Welcome to Anthema, the Unwanted World!" he mut-
tered.
His father had certainly fixed him. But it would not be
forever. If he. Ore, could do anything about it, and he
would let nothing stop him, he would find his way to Los
and kill him. Nevertheless, he groaned with pain. It was all
right to groan and moan and even weep. No one was
watching him.
Except me, Jim thought. I'm watching. But it's OK if he
relieves himself with moans and groans. I'm hurting, too,
every bit as much as he, and I wish I could moan and groan.
I can't. But when he does it, he's doing it also for me,
though he doesn't know that.
725
RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim thought intensely about loosing himself from Ore. He
did not want to endure this pain a second longer than he had
to. To return to his room in the ward would be to shed this
tortured body immediately. But he hung on while telling
himself that he would not desert Ore in the next few
seconds. Something kept him from leaving. A sense of
shame if he abandoned Ore? That was ridiculous. Ore
would be neither hurt nor relieved if his invisible and
intangible companion left him.
Yet, Jim felt that he would be a coward if he took the easy
way out.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (85 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

During Jim's battle with himself, Ore had risen and was
walking slowly down the slope. Each movement of each
limb was an odyssey of pain. Despite this, Ore did not stop.
He left the pile of rock fragments at the bottom of the
mountain and made his way through the forest. This was
mainly trees resembling tall pines but with scarlet tufts at
the ends of the branches. Their odor combined that of
vanilla and peanuts. Large bushes with barrel trunks from
the top of which sprouted twelve long femlike fronds were
in the spaces among the trees. Insects swarmed around the
bushes. They seemed to be attracted by a yellow sticky fluid
welling up from the base of the fronds. A stench like that of
rotten potatoes with a dash of Limburger cheese rose from
it.
The trees were populated with mouse-sized flying mam-
mals. They swooped down, gulped insects, and flew back
to rest on the branches. One fluttered by close to Ore. He
snatched it out of the air, squeezed it until its thin hollow
bones broke, ripped off its wings, tore off its head and legs,
and drank its blood. Then, using his fingernails, he stripped
off its skin and popped it onto his mouth. Chewing slowly
so that he could separate the bones from the flesh with his
tongue. Ore continued through the woods.
729
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim was horrified. At the same time, he felt Ore's
satisfaction at having something to eat. That feeling over-
came Jim's disgust before long.
What Jim came to know quickly, because Ore was
thinking about it, was that young Lords were taught how to
survive and even flourish in the wilderness. Ore had eaten
raw flesh many times before. But when he was able to build
a fire he would cook his meat.
There was plenty of flint in this area. He would work it
into knives, spearheads, axes, and arrowheads. Then he
would kill animals with the weapons he would make and
from their skins make clothing and bags. After that, he
would build a raft and float down the river.
Eighteen days after deciding this, he arrived on his raft at
the broad mouth of the river. Beyond it was a sea.
130
CHAPTER 1 8
SOMEONE ELSE WAS in Ore's mind.
Jim had been frightened many times since entering the young
Lord. That there might be another person or thing sharing Ore's
mind terrified him. It was so ... so ... loathsome
and ... creepy-crawly. It made him so sick he would have
thrown up if he'd had a stomach and a throat. The presence of a
stranger-—no doubt threatening—violated him.
Actually, he did not know the exact nature of the outsider
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (86 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
who was now inside Ore. The first intimation that someone
else—some Thing else—had moved in was two days after
Ore had set up camp at the river's mouth. Jim felt the
presence of the other. How could he put into words just how
he sensed it? He could not. He just knew that it had not been
there until the black moment when he became aware that it
was present. It was like seeing the shadow of H. G. Wells's
invisible man. Or like when, as a child, he had waked up in
the middle of the night and known that a monster was in the
737
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
closet and watching him from behind the half-open door.
The difference now was there was indeed something in the
closet of Ore's brain. Jim's imagination had not evoked it
from his unconscious mind. It was truly there.
Just how did he know that the thing's purpose was sinister?
The same way, he supposed, that a man dying of thirst in the
desert knew why the vulture was circling above him.
When Ore had been within a day's travel on the raft to the
sea, he had awakened that morning in a storm of blue stuff. It
had been wind-blown from upriver, and it was composed of
hand-sized azure pieces shaped like snowflakes. They gave off
a strong walnutty odor. For a few minutes, the flakes were so
numerous that Ore could not see more than ten feet away.
Abruptly, the downfall thinned. A few flakes spun in, and the
storm was over. They did not melt, but most of them were
gone by evening. A horde of insects, birds, and animals
spurted from the deep woods and devoured the flakes. Those
that escaped the feeding frenzy turned brown many hours later
and were ignored by the animals.
Ore, seeing this, decided he would share the banquet with
them. The flakes felt like dried crystallized fungus. They
tasted, however, like cooked and sugared asparagus. He
stuffed himself with them though he had to drink a lot of
water afterward. They dried out his tissues.
Jim theorized it might contain some sort of virus which
infiltrated the eater's body. Then the virus would latch onto the
host's nervous system and, somehow, change from a disorga-
nized mass to a copy of the host's neural system. It became that
being, or a copy thereof, because it was a ghostly reconstruction
of the nerves and brain of the animal it occupied. It dispossessed
the host as an identity, and it replaced the host's consciousness
with its borrowed consciousness.
Jim had a figurative headache while thinking about this.
He came to realize that he could not know where the thing
132
RED ORC'S RAGE
came from or how it got into Ore's mind. It could be a
coincidence that the thing appeared shortly after Ore had
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (87 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

eaten the blue flakes.
Forget explanations, Jim told himself. Deal with the here
and the now. Find a way to fight this unseen, handless, and
faceless entity. Jim wondered how he could warn Ore about
it? After a while, he realized that he could not. The battle,
if there was to be a battle, was going to be between himself
and the thing.
Since he was tired of just calling it a thing, he decided
that he would name it. Everything had to have a name, a
label. What could it be?
"Ghostbrain" came to him. As good a name as any.
Ghostbrain it was.
Five days after arriving at the sea. Ore was hunting for fresh
meat. After three hours, he glimpsed one of the forest-
dwelling antelopes and began stalking it. An arrow was fitted
to his bow, ready to leap forth and plunge into the brown-and-
black dappled side of the cervine. Something spooked it before
he could get within range. It leaped away, dodging around tall
bushes and jumping over the shorter ones.
Cursing silently, he approached the area where it had
been. He was cautious. Whatever had frightened it might be
a large and dangerous beast. Then, peering through a bush,
he saw the cause of the deer's alarm. It was about the size
and shape of a skunk, its big bushy black tail waving. It was
digging into the ground with its shovel-shaped and long-
clawed paws. The rood it sought was buried only an inch or
two in the ground. It did not take long for the beast to
uncover and to start eating it.
Ore would have been disgusted under different circum-
stances. The loathsome creature mostly ate carrion and
excrement and anything edible that was dead or near-dead.
This time. Ore was too astounded to feel repulsion. The
133
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
meal the beast had unearthed was a pile of feces, which he had
expected. What he had not expected was fresh human feces.
He was not the only person on this planet.
He whirled, scanning the woods behind him. His heart
was beating hard, not because of joy but because that other
person might be stalking him.
He glimpsed a dark face and a stone spearhead dropping
behind a bush.
He got on the other side of the bush and looked intently all
around him. The dark man could have companions. When he
was fairly certain that there were none, he called out, "I am
Ore, son of Los and Enitharmon! I am alone! There is no need
for us to try to kill each other! I am looking for the gate out of
this world! I have no quarrel with anyone but my father! Let us
make peace! Each of us has a better chance of finding the gate
if we pool our brains and resources!"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (88 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
He waited. There was no response, and he was sure that
the dark man had left the bush the moment he knew that he
had been observed.
He repeated the speech.
Then a man spoke loudly, though from behind Ore. His
Thoan differed somewhat from Ore's in pronunciation and
pitch, but it was completely understandable.
"You say your only quarrel is with the accursed Los?"
"Right!"
"No one else was stranded here with you?"
"Not that I know," Ore said.
"Put the arrow back in the quiver," the man said. "Then
stand up. I will come to you, though not very close, and I'll
have my spear ready. But I would prefer that we be
friends."
After some more talking, mostly to ensure that one did
not have any advantage over the other, the man walked out
from behind a tree. He was shorter than Ore but broader. He
134
RED ORC'S RAGE
wore a tight-fitting fur cap and a fur loincloth. A leather belt
tied together with thongs was around his waist. It held
leather containers in which were a stone knife and a stone
ax. His quiver and bow had been left behind. His skin was
deep brown, his nose was flat and broad, and his lips were
fully everted. The hair that fell out from under the cap was
gleaming black and slightly wavy.
When he was twenty feet from Ore, he stopped. The dark
brown eyes looked wary, though he was showing large
white teeth in a big grin.
"You are Ore, son of Los and Enitharmon," he said. "I
am Ijim, son of Natho and Ocalythron."
"Ijim of the Dark Woods?" Ore said.
"Yes, I am—was—Lord of the World of Dark Woods."
"You are my great-great-granduncle," Ore said.
"Which does not necessarily mean that we arc friends,"
Ijim said. "As they say in more than one world, you can
choose your friends, but a cousin is a cousin, like it or not."
While they kept the distance between them unchanged,
Ore outlined his story. During this, he kept glancing to both
sides and looking swiftly behind him. What Ijim said about
his being alone might be true. But an overtrusting Lord was
soon a dead one, according to the ancient saw.
Ijim said, "So, you are the son of the extraordinarily
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (89 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
beautiful Enitharmon and of Los, the Eternal Prophet, the
Possessor of the Moon! Such was he titled when he lived in
the world he ruled before moving into his present one, long
before Enitharmon became his wife and long before you
were bom. Here, briefly, is my story."
A Lord, a woman named Ololon, had found a way to
avoid the ingenious traps Ijim had set in the gate giving
entrance to his world. Ololon had come close to slaying
Ijim, but he had gotten away. However, while being
pursued through a series of gates from one world to another,
735
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Ijim had been forced to take a gate which led he did not
know where. It was one-way, and it opened, he soon found
out, to Anthema. That was forty-four years ago. Since then,
Ijim had been looking for the gate which would take him out
of the Unwanted World.
Forty-four years! Jim Grimson thought. During that time,
Ijim must surely have eaten the blue flakes. That meant a
ghostbrain was now using his body and mind. So, it was not
Ijim talking to Ore. It was a Thing.
Then he thought that that was not, in a sense, true. The
ghostbrain had become Ijim, was thinking like Ijim, was, in
effect, Ijim. The first Ijim was dead. The second Ijim was
no different from the first. Thus, he was not one bit more
sinister than the first one. That one had probably been
sinister enough to satisfy anyone.
"As you said, nephew, neither of us has anything the
other wants. Unless you desire Anthema!" He laughed
wildly for some seconds, making Ore wonder if his long
solitude had driven him crazy.
After wiping the tears of laughter with the back of his hand,
Ijim said, "You can have it. I can't leave soon enough. So,
what do you say, nephew Ore? Shall we drop this mutual
suspicion and work together as a dedicated and loving team?"
"As much as two Thoan can."
"Good! Let us give each other the kiss of eternal
friendship and not feel each other's back for a soft spot in
which to thrust a dagger while doing so!"
Ore thought that his uncle's kiss was rather long, and he
did not think that Ijim had to feel his buttocks for so long.
Perhaps Ijim longed so for human contact that he did not
want to let loose of human flesh without thoroughly
warming himself with it. Also, Ijim may have lusted for
only women while they had been easily available, but he
736
RED ORCS RAGE
was willing, after forty-four years of enforced abstinence,
to take whatever came his way.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (90 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
They walked back to the camp side by side. Ijim explained
that he had seen Ore the day before. Instead of joyfully
approaching Ore, however, he had stayed hidden. He had
intended to study him for a while before announcing himself.
Ore said that it was quite a coincidence that the only two
humans on a planet should cross paths.
"Not so much," Ijim said. "I came here out of the same
gate you did, the cave. I explored the cave but the gate was
too well hidden, must've needed a code word to be
revealed. After forty-four years of searching vainly for
another gate and living like a beast all that time, I came
back here. It seemed to me that the outgoing gate might be
located close to the ingoing. Of course, I thought that when
I first got here. I looked the local area over so closely and
so many times that, even now, I can remember its every
detail. But I was going to make another try. It couldn't hurt.
This time, though, since you have a clue on you, the
Shambarimem medallion, we might have a good chance."
"Seen anything around here that could be connected,
however remotely, to a horn?" Ore said. "Not just visually,
perhaps verbally or analogically, whatever?"
"Nothing. But then I wasn't looking for a landmark
which might be somehow linked to the image of a horn.
Now, it's different."
After they got to the camp and talked some more, they
went hunting together. Within twenty minutes, they had
bagged a four-tusked piglike animal. Before eating it. Ore
decided to swim in the river. Though he needed a bath, he
also wished to find out if he could really trust Ijim. He left
his weapons on the bank, but the dark man soon joined him.
Satisfied that Ijim was, for the time being, anyway, a true
partner. Ore got out of the water. Ijim stayed in. But he
737
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
called out to Ore as Ore bent down to pick up his clothes. And
Ijim laughed mightily. It seemed that he would never stop.
When he did, he said, "Don't dress yet."
"Why not?" Ore said. He was not sure what Ijim was up to.
"You can't see it!" Ijim shouted, and he laughed some more.
"See what?"
"Oh, that Los!" Ijim said. "He played a funny trick on
you, but it's a sad one, too. Might have been sad for you,
that is! Fortunately for both of us, Los did not foresee that
you would find another Lord here."
"What are you talking about? Get to the point, man!"
"You can't see it!" the Lord of the Dark Woods cried out.
"You might never have seen it, might've wandered forever
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (91 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

over this terrible place and not seen it!"
"Are you going to hold me in suspense until I die from
curiosity? Or will I have to choke it out of you?"
"There's a map on your back!" Ijim cried. "Between
your shoulder blades and going down to a point almost even
with your hipbones!"
Grinning, he waded out of the river. Ore kept his back to
him so he could study the map, if it was indeed a map. Ore
was not sure that Los had not played a savage joke on him
that was a double joke. The map could be misleading and
lead all over the planet and end up in a place that did not
have a gate. However, why would he put a fake map where
his son would probably never see it?
After Ijim had dried off his nephew's back with a piece of
chamoislike skin, he turned him around to get the full light
of the sun.
"What a sense of humor your father, may the silver arrows
of Elynittria skewer his liver, has! Black, to be sure, blacker
than Shambarimem's depression the first time his Horn was
stolen, but it's worthy of evoking great laughter! On your back
where you can't see it, ho, ho, ho, aauueeegh!"
738
RED ORC'S RAGE
"Choke to death from laughter for all I care," Ore
snarled. "But first tell me what the map looks like. Better
yet, draw it in the mud. I can transfer it to a parchment—
after I make some."
Ijim had danced around, bent over and hoohawing and
then almost strangling from the phlegm in his throat. When
he recovered, he stood behind Ore again.
"There's a tiny black dot at the top of the map," he said. "A
drawing of an arrow sticks out from it. I assume that's the
beginning, the gate you and I came out of. There's a curvy
blue line starting from the end of the arrow. On both sides of
it are black broken lines in the shape of triangles. The
mountains forming the river valley. So, the blue curvy line is
the river we both took when we left the gate. It ends by
spreading out into the crooked lines. The mouth of the river
and the sea it empties into, I suppose. Where we are now. There
are a few blue wavy lines beyond the river's end, but they're
shorter and sharper. Must indicate the sea. Wait a minute."
After several seconds, he said, "I was looking for words
to identify landmarks. There aren't any, and I doubt the map
is anywhere near scale. It's a very rough and not at all
satisfactory guide, but certainly better than none.
"Let's see. Here's a broken green line starting with a
small arrow. It goes north of here since this estuary faces
west, but there are no landmark signs along it. It then turns
east, which should be inland. There is something where it
turns! Let me look closely at it. It's very small."

Then he said, "Looks like the outline of an octopuslike animal.
What in the name of Enion is that supposed to indicate?"
"We'll find out when we get there," Ore said sharply. His
uncle, for some reason, was getting on his nerves. Yet, Ore
should have been dizzy with happiness to have Ijim's
companionship and to have him discover the map. Perhaps,
Ore thought, it was because he felt like a fool and Ijim was
739
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
laughing at him because he was a fool. But then Ijim
seemed to find everything funny.
As the days went by and they walked northward along the
coast, Ijim's too frequent and too easy laughter got on Ore's
nerves. Finally, he could endure it no longer. He stopped his
uncle in the middle of his hysterical and inappropriate hee-
hawing.
"Why do you do that?" he said harshly.
Ijim blinked, and he said, "Do what?"
"Giggle and shriek all the time like an inexperienced and
shy young girl who's nervous because she's with a boy."
Ijim looked sullen. "I didn't know I was doing that. If I
am, and I don't admit I was, it's because I've been alone for
forty-four years, no human being to talk to."
He began to whine. "You'd have some peculiar ways if
you'd been as isolated as I was. Forty-four years! Think
about that!"
"I suppose so," Ore said. "But if I was as silly and
maddening as you, I'd surely want someone to straighten
me out."
"Telling you that wouldn't be dangerous, would it? Oh,
no! Speak up, and die, right? You're not the kind of person
who'd take kindly to being insulted, right?"
Ore said nothing. After a few moments of silence, Ijim
said, "Don't be angry with me. I just met you after
forty-four years of absolute solitude and already you're
yelling at me!"
"Just quit that insane laughing. Don't laugh except when
there's something funny to laugh at."
Ijim shrugged his shoulders. "I'll try. But after forty-four years
of suffering through every minute, every second ..."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (93 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

"And quit whining about 'forty-four years'!" Ore roared.
"I'm tired of hearing it! It's over now! Quit living in the
past! You're not alone anymore!"
740
"I'd be better off," Ijim said. He looked hurt and
comically dignified at the same time.
For a long while after that conversation, Ijim sulked.
Only when Ore addressed him did he reply, and he did so in
as few words as possible. That angered Ore almost as much
as the laughter did. And, twice, when he suddenly turned
around, he caught Ijim sticking his tongue out at him and
gesturing obscenely.
"Manathu Vorcyon!" Ore said the first time he surprised
his uncle in the act. "You're how many thousands of years
old? Yet you behave like a spoiled child!"
"Can't help it," Ijim said. "Forty-four years of
living ..."
"Don't say it!" Ore shouted. "One more time, and I
swear I'll leave you! You can be alone for forty-four more
years! Forever, for all I care!"
For a long while, Ijim took care to avoid mentioning the
length of his stay on Anthema. But he complained often and
about the most trivial things. Such as stubbing his toe. He
spent fifteen minutes talking about it and wondering bitterly
why life had been so hard on him. Obstacles and injuries lay
everywhere in his path.
At last. Ore said, "I've been treated unfairly, brutally,
too, mostly by my father. You don't hear a word about that
from me, do you? It's the way it is. Endure it. But try to do
something about it. Try to change what you don't like. And
quit yapping about it!"
"Yes, but ..."
"No buts!"
"You're a hard man," Ijim said. His eyes became wet,
and he snuffled. "Not all of us are made of stone. Some of
us are genuine human beings, flesh and blood with a heart
that feels, whereas yours ..."
"Grow up! Or is it too late for that?"
J4I
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim, listening to this, was struck with a thought. Struck
was right, right on! Holy Mother! Ore could just as well be
talking about him, Jim Grimson! He had been complaining
about his lot and feeling sorry for himself a good part of his
life. And, until recently, he had really done nothing to solve
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (94 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:32 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
the problems he'd been whining about.
Then another idea hit him like a brass-knuckled fist. Ijim!
Pronounced EE-jeem. But, in his mind, spelled Ijim.
I ... Jim. The Dark Lord of the Woods was named I (am) Jim.
Was Ijim—and, hence, all of this—just a fantasy?
Had his unconscious mind given him the name and the
character of Ijim to show him, circuitously, himself?
For a moment, he came close to losing his faith that the
Tiersian universes were real. He suddenly felt sick and, at
the same time, weightless. The world, as seen through
Ore's eyes, wavered and became cloudy. The light dimmed.
He felt himself rising. He was headed back to Earth. But,
though handless, he grabbed on to something—what, he did
not know—and he held on. The light brightened; things
became steady and clear again.
The Freudian significance of Ijim's name was too obvi-
ous. It was just a coincidence. He knew that this world and
all in it were as real, as hard, and as sharp-edged as his
native universe.
For a while there, though . . .
Thirty-two days after Jim's moment of dark doubt. Ore and
Ijim came to the place indicated by the octopuslike mark on
the map. They did not know they were there until they got
to the end of a valley out of which a small river flowed into
the sea.
Ore was trudging along the shore through water up to his
ankles. Behind was Ijim, silent (for once) except for the
splash-splash of his feet in the rising tide. There were many
M2
RED ORC'S RAGE
large black boulders about ten feet high in this area. Ore
was passing between two separated by about twelve feet
when he stopped. Then he yelled.
Something under the water had gripped his right ankle.
And then it yanked him hard toward the nearest boulder.
Suddenly, he was on his back and being dragged, the green
and stinking surface scum washing into his mouth and over
his eyes.
Ijim shouted, "What is it?"
He snatched his stone ax from his belt and leaped toward
Ore. The young Lord had stopped yelling and was futilely
struggling to loosen the thing gripping his ankle. He yelled
again when a section of the boulder toward which he was
being hauled slid down. Inside the rock was an assembly of
green serrations as sharp as sawteeth and larger than a
lion's. Moreover, there were at least a hundred.
Then a brownish tentacle as thick as two fingers held
together humped for a moment out of the water. Ijim, seeing
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (95 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
that, screamed. He had also realized that the rock was really
a plant or animal. And it meant to eat Ore.
Ijim screamed again. He jumped high. The clawed tip of
another tentacle rose briefly from the spot he had just left.
The Lord came down straddle-legged and hopped back-
ward. The tentacle end thrashed around, groping for him.
Ore had by then gotten his flint ax from his belt and was
chopping down on the tentacle pulling him. It was not easy
to do since he had to sit up and lean far forward while being
pulled along. He called, "Ijim! Help me!"
The Lord of the Dark Woods turned and ran away and did
not stop until he was at a safe distance.
Ore shouted, "You coward!" After that, he was too busy.
Especially since a second tentacle had coiled around the
thigh of his other leg. But he kept hacking until he felt the
grip on his ankle give way. When he was within a few feet
of the gaping mouth, he hewed apart the other tentacle. But
143
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
he came close to being snared by other tentacles as he ran
ankle-deep through the water to where Ijim danced in a
frenzy of despair.
Panting, Ore said, "I should kill you!"
He raised his ax, dripping with water and a thick green
saplike fluid. Ijim ran and did not stop until he was fifty feet
away. He turned, and he shouted in a high-pitched and
quavering voice, "I couldn't help it! Forty-four years I've
survived by running away! It's a conditioned reflex by now!
But I'm not really a coward! I'll do better next time! You'll
see!"
"Next time?" Ore yelled. "There won't be any next
time!"
"Kill me then!" Ijim shrieked. "Find out what loneliness
and no one to talk to mean! You'll end up being just like
me! And the next time you need me, you'll be all alone! I
won't let you down, I swear! If I do, I'll kill myself!"
He got down on his knees and lifted his hands toward
Ore. "I'm begging you, don't leave me here!"
Ore spat toward Ijim. But he said, "All right! One more
chance! But don't get near me for a long while!"
He went eastward, detouring the boulders by many yards.
Ijim stayed behind him, and he did not come to Ore's
camping place that night. Ore could see him in the light of
the fire. He was a shadow sitting with his back against a tree
trunk. In the morning, Ijim approached him. He was
smiling as if nothing had happened. But the rest of that day,
he did nothing to irritate Ore.

CHAPTER 1 9
DAWN BROUGHT WITH its light a darkness.
Ore opened his eyes and could not see. His nose seemed
to be clogged. His mouth was held shut by something, and
something was pressing on his tongue.
Jim had been aware of this some seconds before Ore was
fully roused. Though he had screamed voicelessly with his
no-tongue, he could not, of course, be heard.
Ore tried to tear off the thing covering his face. It felt
fuzzy and sticky, and the tendrils enfolding the front part of
his tongue tasted like prunes. He rolled around in the
sleeping bag, which covered him to his waist. Then he
scrambled out of it, stood up, and then began whirling
around and around as he struggled. He heard Ijim's half-
strangled bellows just before he bumped into him. He fell
backward from the impact and landed on his buttocks.
Making no effort to get up, he dug his fingers into the meaty
layer under the sticky and fuzzy top of the thing. He was
745
PHILIP JOSE FARMER RED ORC'S RAGE
unable to lift it. Then he felt along its edges, his fright now
become mindless panic as his nose and mouth were entirely
filled. When he found that the edges were near his ears, he
got to his knees and groped around until he found his
sleeping bag. If he could not tear off the thing choking him,
he would die in a minute or so. Very soon, anyway.
Thrusting a hand into the bag, he located the scabbarded
flint knife he kept by his side while sleeping. He slid its point
under the edge of the choker. Though he cut his skin, he did
not care. When he had half the length of the stone blade under
the meaty layer, he lifted it. Then he turned the knife so that
the cutting edge was up. Savagely, he pushed upward. The
blade sliced through the fleshly stuff. He grabbed its edges and
ripped them to one side. The stuff came out of his nose and mouth
and from his eyes, though the violent removal hurt as if he were
tearing tape from his skin. Now, he could see and breathe.
The thing in his hand looked like a bright-green piece of
thick cloth with tendrils and thick growths on its underside.
Drawing in deep breaths, he hurled it away and hastened to
help Ijim. The Lord, who had also gotten out of his sleeping
bag, was rolling back and forth on the ground while he vainly
tried to rip the smotherer from his face. Ore used his knife to
pry it loose and hurl it away. It fell among hundreds of similar
things on the ground. The tree branches were festooned with
them. Dozens more were slowly descending to the ground.
Unlike those that had landed, they had swollen backs. Then he
saw the humps of those that had just struck the earth. They
were deflating. He supposed that they had been filled with gas.
He became aware that a half-dozen of the things were
sticking to his body and that his sleeping bag was covered with
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (97 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
them. These fell off shortly afterward. Apparently, if they did
not land on an orifice in living flesh, they did not stay attached.
Everywhere he looked, up, down, around, on the trees
and bushes, out in the river, were the bright-green plants.
Or were they animals?
746
Ijim, blood streaming from his face, gasped for a while
before speaking. His fingers, moving over his face, felt the
liquid. He lifted his hand to stare at it.
"You cut me!" He laughed. "But you cut your own face,
too! Only way to do it, heh?"
"Did you ever run across these things before?"
"Certainly not! I'd have never gone to sleep in the open with-
out covering my face, you can bet on that! From now on . . . !"
"What about the stuff that also comes down from the sky,
the things that look like blue flakes?"
"Sure," Ijim said as he rose. "At least a dozen times. It
isn't bad eating."
Jim thought, Ijim's not Ijim. He's not human. If he ate
the blue flakes, he's been taken over by the ghostbrain by
now. The identityless nonentity had attained identity and
entitydom. But it would not know that. It would think that
it had always been Ijim. It had no mind in its viral state.
When it took over Ijim's mind, it began thinking. But it
itself had no history of which it knew. So, it would always
be Ijim to itself. Which, in a sense, was true.
Mister Lum had once said that humans had identity, but
they had not yet succeeded in defining "identity." Jim tried
to make his own definition now. The only result was
confusion and a phantom headache. He abandoned the
attempt and did not intend to resume it.
The thing that was called Ijim was to all intents and pur-
poses the exact same as the original Ijim. Or so Jim thought.
Somehow, that the Lord was occupied by a ghostbrain seemed
to make him more sinister. That, Jim told himself, was
because he had read too many science-fiction stories and seen
too many horror movies. In these, the almost always evil alien
meant to eat, enslave, or mind-possess humans. Yet, could
anything be more sinister than a human being? Some human
beings, anyway, like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin—the list
747
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
was as long as a census report. So evil were they, they seemed
to be nonhuman. But being evil was part of being human, just
as being good was part of being human. And these demon-
strably evil people, without exception, high or low, Albanian
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (98 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
dictator or Chicago alderman, corrupt Senator or Washington
pimp, thought of themselves as being good.
The two Lords broke camp and went east along the river.
Late that afternoon, they set up camp again. Though they
would normally have pushed on until close to dusk, they
had to make sleeping masks to protect their mouths and
noses from the green things. During the following two days,
they saw a number of animals that had succumbed to the
"chokers," as Ore called them.
Their tendrils were growing over the rotting carcasses.
Those that had failed to kill were turning brown and brittle.
After that incident, Ijim began to fall into long silences
broken by a low muttering. During these, he would stare
wildly around. Ore would endure this behavior as long as he
could. He would ask Ijim what he was thinking about.
Always, Ijim would react as if he had suddenly been wakened
from a very deep sleep. He would blink his eyes and shake his
head and say, "What? What are you talking about?" Then he
would deny that he was disturbed by anything.
Jim Grimson thought that the ghostbrain, not Ijim, was
speaking during the fugues. Maybe it was having flashes of its
life in a previous form before it became a virus or whatever
drifting around on the blue things. Who knew what phases it
had gone through? A person seeing a butterfly for the first time
would not dream that it had been a caterpillar.
Thirty more days passed, though not without dangerous
incidents. There were no more green chokers in their path,
but they did see hundreds of thousands on the ground in
another valley when they were going through a mountain
pass. One afternoon, a sickening gas rolled down a hole in
148
RED ORC'S RAGE
a mountainside, enveloped them, and left them vomiting for
several hours and unwell for two days. The larger animals
were similarly affected; all the small birds and animals died.
They thought that they were getting close to the place
where the gate was if Los had not lied. Ijim checked the
map on his nephew's back.
"The markings are almost at an end. Those wavy
parentheses should mean the big lake just ahead of us."
They were standing at the top of a steep slope. Two miles
or more away, at the foot of the slope, was the immense
lake Ijim had expected. It was about two miles wide at the
end nearest to them and broadened out until it melted into
the horizon. The forest grew almost to the water. About two
miles east, towering cliffs suddenly bordered the lake and
ran as far as Ore could see.
"We'll have to build a boat or climb up and go along the
edges of the cliffs," he said. "They're very rough and
precipitous. I think we should make a canoe."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (99 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"Agreed."
Ijim continued his map reading.
"Apparently, when we come to near the end of the lake, we
bear right. The last mark must point out the gate place. It's a
circle with a cross in it and many horizontal thin lines over the
cross. Maybe close, maybe not. But . . . one step at a time.
As the Grandmother of All, Manathu Vorcyon said, 'Who gets
ahead of himself sees his own backside.'"
Twenty days later, they had built an outrigger dugout
with a mast and a woven-grass sail. It took them another ten
days to kill enough animals, smoke and salt the meat, and
collect nuts and berries for boatboard supplies.
"Los is making us work hard," Ijim said. "If I get a
chance to capture him, I'll make him pay for that. How
about skinning him alive, just to start off with?"
Ore smiled. If anyone was going to skin his father, he
would be the one.
749
CHAPTER20
I HE TWO LORDS had traveled an estimated three hundred
miles since leaving the lakeshore. Yet they had seen nothing
resembling the symbol on Ore's back.
Ijim's fugues were becoming more frequent and longer-
lasting. When he came out of them, he remembered nothing
about them. In fact, he did not know that he had been in
them. Ore, he said, was making up the whole business. He
wanted to drive him crazy. Ore asked him why he would
want to do that. Because, Ijim said. Ore was crazy, and the
insane loved the company of their kind.
The young Lord realized that it was useless to continue
arguing with his uncle. Ijim was the mad one in this twosome.
Therefore, he would have to be watched carefully. Ore had
thought that his uncle was going to refrain from violence until
the gate was found. Now, he was not sure.
Jim Grimson was even more apprehensive than Ore. Ijim
must die, and he must do it in Anthema. If he got to another
750
RED ORC'S RAGE
world, he—the thing in him—might propagate its kind, and
the next world and the next, all the worlds, might be taken
over. Just how, Jim could not guess. The how no longer
mattered. Ijim had to be killed here, and it would be best if
his body and the thing possessing it were destroyed.
He knew that. Ore did not.
Ten days later, near high noon, the Lords were on top of a
lofty ridge forming a wall along the right side of a river. They
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (100 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
had been forced to climb up its slope and go along its back
until they found more level ground. "For all we know," Ore
told Ijim, "the landmark could be on the other side of the ridge."
And it was.
At the foot of the ridge was a plain stretching for perhaps
forty miles. Another chain of mountains to the south
bounded the plain. This contained scattered woods and
rivers and creeks and some hilly country. A large, black,
slowly moving object relatively near them was a herd of
animals, grass-eaters.
"There it is!" Ore said. He pointed at a circular object
about two miles from the foot of the ridge and close to a
river so small it barely escaped being a creek. The structure
glittered in the sun as if made of glass. Its outer walls,
forming the circle, were high and thick. Enclosed by the
circle was a cross-shaped structure. Its walls were as thick
as the enclosing walls. Thinner walls ran parallel to the
horizontal wall of the cross. The whole structure had to be
that represented by the symbol on Ore's back.
"Great Mother of Us All!" Ore shouted, and he struck his
hand against his forehead. "Mighty and wise Enion! How
dumb can we be? We call ourselves Lords, and we're as
mindless as worms! Why did we never connect the symbol
on my back with that on the medallion! They both represent
the grillwork in the end of Shambarimem's Horn! It was
there right in front of us, and we never connected the two!"
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
Ijim was, at the moment, not in a fugue. He howled with
delight and grabbed Ore's hands. They danced around and
around, both grinning and yelling. Several times, they
almost lost their footing on the narrow flat top of the ridge.
Finally, panting, they stopped.
Ore frowned then. He said, "But it's a building, an
artifact! I didn't know there were humans here!"
"Neither did I," Ijim said.
"Where's the gate? Inside that building?"
"Must be," Ijim said. Grimness had shouldered aside his
joy. A few seconds later, he started to mutter. Knowing
from experience that the Lord would follow him automati-
cally, Ore started down the steep side of the ridge. Though
he had to be careful because of loose stones here and there,
he could stay on his feet. Ijim seemed to be enclosed on
himself, but he did not fall. A part of him was still alert
enough to handle simple situations.
Halfway down. Ore exclaimed, and he stopped. Ijim,
still muttering, halted a few feet above him. The grassy
ground around the herd of black long-homed animals had
opened in scores of places. Ore was too far away to make
out the details, but the openings were like the doors of
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (101 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
trapdoor spiders. Where there had been grass were now
round black holes with discs, grass-topped on the outer
side, sticking straight up from the ground.
Out of the holes popped long lean gray creatures. They
bounded toward the herd, which stampeded in the opposite
direction. This was toward the woods fringing this part of
the plain. Now, other gray killers were racing from the
woods. The herd wheeled as one back toward the plain.
Directly in its path, more trapdoors swung up. Scores of
hunters leaped out of the holes and, like the greyhounds
they resembled, sped toward the antelopes. When they got
to the edge of the milling herd, they shot long, thin, gray
752
strands from their mouths. These arced up, shining in the
sun, fell onto the prey, and stuck as if they were glue.
Presently, many antelopes had fallen, their legs entangled in
the strands. The hunters, whistling loudly, were on them
within seconds and tore them apart with their teeth. The rest
of the herd broke through the lines and galloped off.
Ore started down, saying, "Ijim! Those beasts must come
from the glassy building through underground routes to the trap-
doors. Now we know how to get inside it, if we have the
courage!"
Ijim continued to mutter. When they were close to the
beginning of the plain, they examined one of the trapdoors.
Those in the woods had been closed. The gray beasts who had
issued from them must intend to return via those on the plain.
Ore pried up the round and partially grown-over lid with his
spearhead. It rose up soundlessly. Around the neck of the hole
was a rim into which the door fitted. The rim was a hard glassy
substance, probably the same used to form the circular building.
The trapdoor was also made from the glassy stuff. Earth
had been glued to its top and heaped and impregnated with
the fixative. Grass grew from this earth.
The hinge was provided by a substance spread at the point
where the lid would be raised. This was hard on the edges and
semihard between them but flexible enough to permit the lid to
be raised without breaking loose from the rim.
Ore suspected that all the glassy substance had been
spewed from the gray beasts' mouths just as the entangling
strands had been.
About three feet below the opening of the hole was a
platform of dirt. The animals must have jumped out from this
to the surface. Beyond that, the tunnel slanted down and
probably became horizontal about ten feet below the ground.
Its wall was enclosed with the gray glassy substance. This
must line the tunnel all the way to the entrance inside the
building and thus keep the tunnel from collapsing.

Ore lowered the door. They then watched the hairless
beasts tear off chunks of flesh from the carcasses and take
these into the holes on the plain. They were much more than
the canines they resembled at a distance. A set of insectine
pincers projected from the sides of their mouths. These
moved independently of the heads' movements and cut and
sliced the meat and then closed on large pieces. The beasts
had long prehensile tails which curled around other pieces.
Those animals with full burdens leaped into the holes
carrying meat with their jaws, pincers, and tails.
Their ears were round, thick, and flat, and their pale-
yellow eyes were large. After listening to their whistling for
a few minutes, Ore decided that they were communicating
in a limited form of code. He had counted seven variations
of a series of long and short whistles.
"These are no dummies," he softly told Ijim. "Look at
their foreheads. Plenty of room for brains in those skulls."
Ijim nodded. He had recovered from the fugue halfway
through the woods.
"Fantastic creatures!" Ore said. "They're a combination
of dog, termite, spider, and monkey! The Vanished Ones
went all out when they made these! I'm telling you, Ijim, of
all the sciences, biology is the most fascinating! Life and its
multitudinous forms! However, the brain, the brain! That's
the apex of life, the jewel!"
He told Ijim that kamanbur—"whistlers"—was as good a
name as any for the beasts.
"Have to have a name for everything."
He and Ijim walked through the woods to the river. There
Ore pointed out that the plain inclined downward to the
kamanbur structure. "Dig a ditch from the river to the
nearest trapdoor. Flood it. The water should fill the tunnel
and drown the stories below the surface level. During the
diversion, we enter the nest."
154
RED ORC'S RAGE
"Dig a ditch!" Ijim howled. "Are you crazy? It'll take us
months to make the tools to dig with and then to do the
digging! It's not a small project! Also, we'll be in full sight
of the kamanbur while we're working. You think they're
going to give us the time we need?"
"What else do we have beside time?" Ore said. "Or are
you so busy with other matters?"
Ijim grumbled. He spoke of soft beds, soft sheets, and
even softer women, and the delicious food and heady liquor
and rapturing drugs and his triumphant assaults on the Lords
of other worlds in the days before the accursed Los had
chased him into this nightmare universe. Ore paid him no
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (103 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
attention. He was thinking that antlers could be made into
diggers to break up the earth. Shovels and spades could be
made from strips of animal homs fixed to a hardwood base.
Baskets to carry the dirt could be woven. Their tools would
wear out soon, but they would just make replacements.
First, though, he had to check out the kamanbur nest. Ijim,
expecting a ravening horde to burst from the trapdoors,
followed him reluctantly. No kamanbur came out, though it
was soon apparent that the men could be seen from the structure.
There were thousands of holes, a half-inch in diameter, in the
walls. These would pass through a certain amount of fresh air and
of light and provide observation apertures for the kamanbur.
During the next few days, the Lords built a treehouse for
sleeping and to thwart any arboreal predators. Then they
intensively explored the neighborhood when they were not
making tools for their project. And, to Ore's delight, he
found a number of trapdoors on the other side of the river.
"Their tunnels go under the river!" he said. "Under! That
means we won't have to dig that tremendous ditch on the
other side! We'll let the river flood the nest!"
"You mean we'll have to go down the tunnel under the
river? And just how do you think we'll break the sheathing?
155
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
And even if we can, the noise of hammering and pounding
will bring the kamanbur running!"
"You've been a deep pain in my ass for some time now,"
Ore said. "You used to be so jolly I forgave you your irritating
habits and your running off at the mouth. Not to mention your
crazy fits. But I'm really tired of your pessimism."
"What crazy fits?"
Ijim was bristling.
Ore went down into the tunnel. The trapdoor was left
propped open. The young Lord hoped that this would make
some fresh air flow through the tunnel. Ijim did not come
along with Ore.
"There's not enough space for two to work together," he
said. "Anyway, this is just a reconnoiter. You don't need me."
"Fine!" Ore said. "You can work with your flint. We're
going to need a couple of hundred awls before we're through."
Ijim had mentioned the night before Ore's descent into
the tunnel that he should tell him that he tended to panic in
closed small places. He would not like it if Ore told anyone
about this. But there it was.
"That doesn't mean I won't be going with you when we
try for the gate. I'll make it through with you. Somehow.
I've done it before when it was absolutely necessary. And if
it didn't take too long."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (104 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

Thus, Ore was now alone as he crawled on hands and
knees. He wore pads on his knees and gloves on his hands. He
carried a lit torch and several extra torches. Attached to his belt
was the end of a thin strip of rawhide. He had estimated the
distance between the trapdoor and the point at which the tunnel
would be deepest under the river. To make sure, he had probed
the river in its middle to gauge its depth.
When the strip became tight, it would indicate that he
should stop crawling. He hoped that the estimate was near
the reality. He also hoped that the torch fumes would not
756
RED ORC'S RAGE
overcome him. As it was, they made him cough and burned
his eyes.
After a near unendurable length of time, the strip tau-
tened. He took his gloves off, wet a finger, and held it up.
There seemed to be a very slight flow of air, but he could
just be imagining that. Wishful thinking or not, he had to go
to work. He got down onto his back. After removing from
his bag the wooden support he had built, he set it by his
side. Having placed the torch upright in the support, he
incised a square on the top of the tunnel with one of the
sharp flint scrapers from the bag.
Ijim was right. Hammering or pounding would bring the
kamanbur. Eventually, he would have to use a stone
hammer. But that could wait until the last moment. The
scraper made a screeching noise which he hoped would die
out before it reached the other end of the tunnel.
He was taking a chance that some lone kamanbur or a
pack of kamanbur would come along this tunnel. If that
happened, it would happen.
Though the glassy substance was hard, it was softer than
iron. It could be cut as easily as bronze, though "easily"
was only a relative term. Tiny flakes shining in the
torchlight fell down onto his chest. Stopping now and then
to wipe the sweat from his face or to drink water from his
leather bottle, he moved the edge of the scraper across the
lines of the square. After an indeterminate time, he stopped.
The torch fumes seemed to be stronger, and he felt
somewhat faint. His moistened finger could detect no
movement of air. Alarmed, he took the torch from its
support and crawled back toward the entrance trapdoor.
He and Ijim had arranged signals for emergencies. The
Lord of the Dark Woods would tug the strip twice, pause,
then tug it twice again to call Ore out of the tunnel. Ore
would do the same if something happened to him that

required that Ijim drag him out by the leather strip. Ore
crawled back to the platform. The trapdoor was closed. The
end of the strip which Ijim was to hold was lying on the
platform. Something must be wrong if Ijim had shut the door.
He rolled the torch down the slope so that its light would not
be seen when he raised the door. Slowly, he moved the door
up about an inch. He saw several kamanbur moving around at
the base of the tree which held the little hut he and Ijim had
built. The lower branches were festooned with the shiny gray
strands spat from the creatures' mouths. When he raised the
door another inch, he saw that the treehouse was beyond the
reach of these. Ijim's dark face was in a window.
An hour later, the beasts had left. Ore crawled out of the
tunnel and went to the tree. He called up softly, "What hap-
pened?"
Ijim, while climbing down, said, "They came to investi-
gate. I think they came through a tunnel upriver and then
circled around through the woods. I saw them before they got
close, and I ran to the tree. I'm sorry I didn't have time to
signal you. The only thing I could do was to close the trapdoor
and hope they hadn't seen me doing it. I guess they didn't."
"Maybe, now they've satisfied their curiosity, they'll
leave us alone," Ore said.
He went down the tunnel after a while and resumed work.
The next day, he crawled to the other end of the tunnel
before he began his scraping. He had to determine that that
exit-entrance was open. Or, if it were closed, that it could
be opened from the tunael side. A pale light in a round
frame and loud whistling sounds showed that there was no
trapdoor on this end. Since he might be smelled by the
tenants, he went no closer.
Six days later, while he was incising, a drop of water fell
on his face. That was soon followed by a steady drip. He
continued scraping away in the narrow trenches forming the
758
square. Water was soon oozing out from all four of the lines.
Then, in one comer, it spurted out. He got out of the tunnel.
"I don't think it's going to give way until it's hammered
at," he told Ijim. "The kamanbur will hear me. But if I can
loosen it enough so the water breaks through entirely, it
won't matter."
"You don't want to wait until tomorrow?" Ijim said. He
was pale under his dark pigment.
"Let's get everything ready now," Ore said. "That won't
take more than a few minutes. Then I go back. Be ready."
The sun was three-quarters of the way across the sky. Big
black clouds were building up to the west, and the faint
sound of thunder reached them.
The trees on the north side of the bank partly obscured the
vision of the watchers in the nest. Ore and Ijim had also
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (106 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
transplanted several large bushes to conceal their activities.
Ore was not worried about being seen. But a party of
kamanbur, reinvestigating the men, could show up at any
time.
When he got back to the square, he drove several flint
awls into its comers. His stone hammer struck again and
again against a leather pad placed on the blunt end of the
awl. He did not want to make much noise until he was ready
to begin hammering on the square itself. The awls punched
through the comers easily enough, though he had to use a
different tool for each comer. The ends became quickly
blunted or broken off.
Water had formed in a pool below the square. He was
half-sunk in it. Suddenly, water spurted out of the tiny hole
just made in a comer of the incised square. Its high-pressure
jet half-blinded him, and he had to stop several times to
blow water out of his nose. Despite the difficulties, he
finished with the awls. Then he used a heavy stone hammer.
The force of the blows was decreased by lack of space to
759
PHILIP JOSE FARMER RED ORC'S RAGE
swing the hammer and by his position on his back. Also, he
had moved back so that his face was not directly below the
square. That changed the angle of attack. He persisted,
knowing that many lesser blows would equal a few strong
ones.
Between the impacts of the stone on the square, he could
hear whistlings. The kamanbur would soon be on him.
Then, as he had expected—no way to avoid it—the shiny
gray square shot down and against his chest. It struck hard
enough to hurt him. The water spouted through and hit him
with a force harder than that of the square. He rolled over,
though the water pressed him to the tunnel floor for a
moment. He began crawling away as swiftly as he could.
Water rose until he was swimming, though its advance bore
him upward at a slight angle toward the trapdoor. The
tunnel had become black as soon as the water had doused
the torch flame. His tools were left behind. It was his life
that concerned him now.
Ijim was supposed to be hauling in the line as hard and as
swiftly as he could. If his efforts were doing any good, they
were not apparent. Ore could feel no tug on the line.
He saw daylight ahead. The trapdoor had been left open.
Then he could see nothing. The water had filled the tunnel
and was rising faster then he could swim. A few seconds
later, he burst into the nearly vertical part of the tunnel just
below the trapdoor. Ijim grabbed Ore's outstretched hand
and yanked him on out. The water surged up above the hole
and fell back. Thereafter, it stayed level with the surface of
the river.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (107 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

The thunderheads were closer, larger, and blacker. Ore
hoped that the lightning, thunder, and possibly rain would
come soon. For some reason, he thought that all that would
aid the Lords' invasion of the nest. It would certainly make
it more dramatic.
760
Some weapons, including bows and arrows and short
spears, were in watertight cases. Ijim helped strap one on
Ore; Ore helped Ijim with his case. With other weapons
inserted in containers in their belts, they plunged. Ore first,
into the dark tunnel. Ijim was still pale, and his teeth were
chattering. But he looked determined. Ore, however, was
not sure that his uncle would have the courage to follow
him. The claustrophobia would be made worse by having to
swim all the way into the nest. As it was. Ore was not sure
that they would not drown before reaching their goal.
Just as he believed that he could no longer hold his
breath, he saw a glimmer above him. He thrust upward
desperately, and his head broke the surface. A few seconds
later, Ijim's dark face was beside him.
Ijim drew in several long breaths, then gasped, "That was
the most terrible thing I've ever endured! I thought ..."
"Quiet!" Ore said softly. While dog-paddling and suck-
ing in air, he looked around. There was just enough space
between the water and the ceiling for their heads. The pale
light from an opening in the floor of the story above shone
on a ramp ascending from the water to the opening. Around
them floated the bodies of many kamanbur, adults and
puppies. No sound came from above.
He swam to the ramp and went up it on his hands and
knees. When he got to the room above, he took his ax from
its container. Ijim, still gasping, was close behind him. A
faint breeze moved over Ore's wet skin and brought him an
unidentifiable stench. The room was empty of kamanbur
but not of other living creatures. Some were in large cages
constructed of the dried gray strands and set along the bases
of the walls and halfway up them. The grasshopper-sized
insects therein glowed intermittently but made a steady
light. The off phases of half of them were balanced by the
on phases of the other half.
767
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"Fascinating," Ore said. "A very unusual symbiosis
between insects and mammals."
In larger cages attached to the walls were two other types
of insects. One had scarlet-and-yellow-striped wings which
beat as swiftly as a hummingbird's. Their combined noise
made a low roar. These obviously kept the air moving.
There were also spidery things the size of Ore's head. He
had no time to determine their function.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (108 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

He undid the waterproof case. From it, he took a short
flint-tipped spear, a quiverful of arrows, and a bow. The
spear was in a slender case within the larger case. After
fitting the quiver strap over his shoulder, he strung the bow.
Then he fitted an arrow to the bow. Having done all this
very quickly, he trotted off along the curving wall. He
passed a number of hallways. Not until he came to one with
a larger entrance did he halt. This should lead to the room
at the intersection of the two buildings that formed the
horizontal and vertical arms of the cross within the circle, as
seen from the top of the ridge. His guess was that Los had
placed the gate at the intersection. But he had no idea on
what floor it would be.
"Hurry!" Ijim said behind him. "They'll be coming
down as soon as they get over their scare!"
Ore did not reply. He ran down the hallway past the
insects in the walls. The light was not strong, though that
coming through the thousands of holes in the walls added to
the illumination. Abruptly, he was in the room in the central
part of the cross.
He stopped. He was in luck. There, in the center of the
round-walled room, was the gate. It was made of the shim-
mering more-than-diamond-hard metal called tenyuralwa.
Around it were piled kamanbur bones. These were a
warning to the nest tenants to stay away from the upright
square. Some time ago, the gate had been erected by Los,
762
RED ORC'S RAGE
who had by some means kept the kamanbur from attacking
him. After he had left, the creatures had investigated the
gate. Some had gone through the side which was set with a
trap and had perished. The parts of the bodies that had been
in this world when the foreparts were burned or cut off had
been arranged around the gate by the kamanbur. All the
skeletons were of the hind parts only.
"If the kamanbur come down now," Ijim said, "we won't
have much time to figure out how to get through!"
The gate was a metal square seven feet high. Its base had
been secured to the floor with a hard black stuff, Thoan glue
that no acid could dissolve or any fire bum away. Ore put his
bow and arrow down, removed his spear from its case, and put
it by the bow. After picking up a bone, he went to the other
side of the gate and threw the bone through the square. It
passed through unhindered and landed on the floor. That
meant that the opposite side of the gate was the entrance to the
other world.
Ijim had untied and unrolled a leather bundle and
removed from it two torches and the ignition materials.
They were a box containing wood shavings, splinters, dried
grass, twigs, and two roughened flints set into wooden
handlers. He arranged the inflammable material in a pile
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (109 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

and began striking the flints together.
Ore walked around the square, kicking bones out of the
way. Then he cast one through the opposite side of the
square. As he expected, it disappeared. Another bone thrust
a few inches into the square and quickly withdrawn was
unsheared. A second later, he repeated the same action.
This time, all the bone extended past the middle of the gate
had been sheared off. That part was not visible because it
was in the other world.
Ijim was cursing. The sparks struck from the flints had
763
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
not set fire to the pile. He said, "Sometimes, it takes a lot
of time! But we may not have that!"
Ore was too intent on his tests to reply. He put a legbone
in again and again, counting seconds, rientawon, rienshi-
won, rienkawon, rienshonwon, riengushwon. Translated,
one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three,
one thousand four, one thousand five. When he had used up
that bone, he began testing with another.
Ijim said, "Ah! Finally! Success!"
Ore turned to face him. The Lord of the Dark Woods was
holding the end of a pine brand just above the fiery pile. The
smoke from the flames was drifting slowly toward the
nearest exit, which was the square of the gate.
"Listen carefully, Ijim. The trap seems to be a time-
interval shears. I don't think the timing is random. We have
approximately a second and a half to get through. The field
goes off just that long. We have to stand close and jump
through. But we must raise our hands up and hold our
elbows close to our body. Our legs must be in the same
vertical plane as our bodies. Anything sticking out too far
ahead of our bodies or too far behind will be cut off."
Ijim nodded, and he said, "One hop does it. It'll be
awkward to do that and go through without bending our
knees."
Ijim understood as well as Ore—after all, he was many
thousands of years older—that each man would have to use
a bone first to test and thus to estimate the time base on
which to start counting before taking the hop. There would
be nothing accurate or guaranteed about the counting.
Mostly, it would be luck that would get them through
safely.
"One chance only," Ore said. He started, then stared past
Ijim.

"We won't have time to practice jumping before we make
the real one. Give me a torch."
Ijim, who had been bent over while lighting the second
torch, straightened up and whirled around. By then, the
room near the archway was filled with forty or so kaman-
bur. They spread out, their heads hanging low, jaws open,
teeth gleaming, saliva dripping, pincers clacking together,
prehensile tails straight up but curling at the ends. Their
yellow eyes were fixed on the men.
Ore saw directly down the mouth of one. Inside it were
two hornlike projections. These would be the guns, as it
were, out of which were shot the thin quick-drying strands.
Ijim advanced to the pile of bones encircling the gate,
shouted, and waved the torch at them. They shrank away
from him. Then one of them, a large female, emitted a
series of long and short whistles. The gray beasts formed a
circle around the bone enclosure.
Ore said, "They may have figured out that they can come
through the gate on the other side without being harmed.
They could attack us from two sides."
He ran around the gate and swung the torch back and
forth at the kamanbur. They moved back but not as far as
when they had first been threatened.
Ijim screamed, "Let's do it now! I'll go first! You watch
my back!"
Ore could not help wondering if Ijim was planning to
shove him back through the gate when he jumped after him.
The idea of doing that to Ijim had occurred to him, though
he had rejected it. Why should Ijim do that? He would still
need Ore. But the Lords, like the leblabbiy, did not always
act logically.
Ore ran back to the other side. He waved his torch as he
did so. Gray strands shot out from the mouths of those in the
front rank. They fell short by a few inches. After the
765
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
range-finding tests, the kamanbur moved about a foot closer
to the Lords. By the time he reached Ijim, the Lord was
burning off several strands wrapped around his legs. The
quickly flaming strands stank like a mixture of garlic and
rotten potatoes.
The leader whistled some more messages, and they
retreated. Then a dozen advanced a few feet from the pack
and crouched. They looked so much like runners at the
blocks that Ore understood what they meant to do. They
would dash forward in a body and, when very close, jump.
While still in the air, they would expel the entangling
strands. Their prey would not be able to bum them all away
before the kamanbur fell upon them.

"Now!" Ore yelled.
Ijim turned around slowly. His eyes were as unmoving as
glass balls set in cement. His lips, however, were writhing
as he articulated very swiftly but not very clearly.
Ore groaned. Of all the times that the fugue had over-
come Ijim, this was the worst.
There was nothing that Ore could do for him—except one
thing. It would give his uncle little chance to live, but it was
better than nothing.
Ore snatched the torch from Ijim's hand and sent it
whirling toward the crouched beasts. Whistling in alarm,
they scattered as the torch fell near them. Ore grabbed Ijim
and swung him around, then seized him by the waist and ran
him forward. Ijim was still muttering when he was lifted
and thrown through the gate.
There had been no time to stick a bone through the gate
and withdraw it while counting. Ore had, however, lifted
him up and cast him in as vertical an angle as he could
manage.
Blood spurted from the empty air. Though the back
portion of Ijim was severed, it had fallen on through. But
766
not quickly enough to prevent some blood on this side of the
gate, from shooting back. The leader whistled. The beasts
rallied and formed ranks again. Another series of whistles
launched them. Those on the other side of the gate were
coming as swiftly as those on this side. If he did not act fast,
he would be knocked down or entangled before he could
leap through the square. They would pass through that side
of the gate unharmed and prevent him from coming through
on his side.
He threw the torch over the square. It spun in an arc and
struck the lead kamanbur. It shied away, and others ran into
it. The whistling was deafening.
Ore did not look behind him. A delay of a second might
be fatal. Then again, it might be just the time he needed for
success.
Yelling, he ran up to the gate, then stopped. He lifted his
arms and held his legs as straight as he could. He was
hoping that the kamanbur behind him would not get to him
in time to knock him through the gate. Without pausing or
taking enough time to check that his body attitude was as
vertical as possible, he rose up on his toes.
He gave another yell as he hopped forward.
That was too much for Jim Grimson.
He had been striving to tear himself loose from Ore. Ore

might make it; he might not. Jim did not want to chance it.
If Ore died, he might die, too. Though he had risked all the
dangers up to now, he could not face this one.
Abruptly, he was flashing through a lightless space. He
could feel nothing except a vague sensation of speed. But he
could hear whistles.
Then he was back in his room. The clock indicated that
he—rather, his astral soul or whatever it was—had been
gone for two hours and three minutes.

CHAPTER 2 1
I HOUGH JIM'S LIFE as Ore had been exhausting and peril-
ous, it was surrounded by a light different from the light of
Belmont City. The suns of the other universes shed a soft
and golden light. Earth's was still gritty and harsh.
If only he were not so tired, he would have returned at
once to Ore. Should he fail to get into him, he would know
that Ore was dead. That meant that he would have to choose
another character with whom to integrate and to become. If,
that is, he then chose to continue therapy. With Ore gone,
what was there left for Jim Grimson?
It did not matter that other patients were now using Red
Ore as their personae. Their Ore was the fictional Ore. He
had been in the brain of the real Ore, son of the real Los and
Enithannon.
What most delayed his return was his fear that Ore had
been cut in two.
Would Ore have allowed that to stop him from going
back if he were in Jim Crimson's skin? No!

RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim's birthday came. The only ones who celebrated were
Jim and his fellow patients, with Doctor Porsena showing
up briefly during the muted festivities. His mother and Mrs.
Wyzak sent cards and phoned him. His mother could not get
away from her job to visit him. The cake that Mrs. Wyzak
said she had left in the lobby got lost somewhere along the
delivery route. Just his luck, Jim thought. And he was still
too depressed and still too fearful to attempt reentry into
Ore.
Two days after his birthday, he was called out from lunch
in the dining hall. Gillman Sherwood, officer of the day,
said, "It's your mother."
"Now?" Jim said. "She's supposed to be working."
Sherwood raised his eyebrows as if the thought of a
mother who had to work was surprising.

Jim's heart was beating hard when he entered the visitors'
room. Only very bad news would bring her here at this
time. It had to be a death in the family. His sister? His
father? If it was his father, his son was feeling far worse
about Eric's death than he had imagined he would. He
should not have such distress, a pang of terrible loss. But,
after all, whatever had happened between them, Eric was
his father.
By the time he had reached the entry, be was convinced
that Eric Grimson had died. Booze? Accident? Suicide?
Murder? Any of those was possible.
Eva Grimson rose from a chair as Jim strode through the
doorway. She was in a print dress which fitted far too
loosely and was too thin for cold weather. Her face had
become more gaunt and lined. The darkness around the eyes
was blacker. Though her worn brown cloth coat hid the
thinness of her body, her birdlike legs showed that she must
have lost weight everywhere. But she smiled when she saw
her son.

Jim took her in his arms as he cried, "Mom! What's
wrong?"
Eva began weeping. Jim felt even worse. He had seen his
mother weep only a few times. "Is Dad all right?" he said.
She pushed herself away and sat down in the chair. "I'm
sorry, Jim," she said. "So sorry. But your father ..."
She began sobbing. He got down on his knees by her and
put his arm around her heaving shoulders. "For God's sake!
What is it?"
"Your father ..."
"He's dead!" Jim said.
She looked surprised. Instead of answering immediately,
she took a handkerchief from her handbag and dabbed at her
eyes. Jim had the irrelevant thought that her tears would not
destroy her makeup since she never used it.
After sniffling, she shook her head. "No. Is that what you
thought? In a way, it might be ..."
"Be what?"
She must have meant to say "better." But she would not
allow herself to continue to have such thoughts, let alone
voice them.
"Nothing. Your father ... he insists that we move to
Dallas! You know, in Texas!"
It took Jim several breaths before he could think clearly.
His chest still felt tight. Then he said harshly, "He might as
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (114 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

well be dead then! You, too! You . . . you . . . you're
deserting me!"
She took his hand and pressed it against her wet cheek.
She wailed, "I have to go with him! He's my husband! I
have to go where he goes!"
"No, you don't!" Jim said. He jerked his hand away from
hers. "Damn you and damn him! All the way to hell!"
Not until later, when he reran the scene in his mind, did
he realize that he had almost never before spoken to his
770
mother like that. No matter how angry he had been with her,
he had almost always been gentle. She had been hurt
enough by his father.
"For the sake of blessed Mary, mother of God, don't say
that, Jim!"
She reached out to take his hand again, but he moved it
away.
"He can't get a decent job here. It's killing him, you
know that. He's heard ... a friend told him—you re-
member Joe Vatka?—there's plenty of work in Dallas. It's
a booming town, and ..."
"What about me?" Jim said. He began pacing back and
forth, his hands clenching and unclenching. "Don't I count?
And who's going to pay for the insurance, for my therapy?
Where am I going to live when I'm an outpatient? I don't
want to give up therapy! This is my only chance to make it!
I won't, I won't!"
"Please understand, son. I'm torn, I'm being pulled
apart. But I can't let him go without me, and he says he will
if I don't go, too. He is my husband. It's my duty!"
"And I'm your son!" Jim shouted.
Kazim Grasser, a black nurse, put his head in the room.
"Everything OK? Any problem?"
"This is a family matter," Jim said. "I'm not going to get
violent. Beat it!"
Grasser said, "OK, man, just take it easy," and he
withdrew his head.
"And why doesn't he come here and tell me instead of
sending you?" Jim bellowed at his mother. "Is he afraid to
face me? Does he hate me so much he doesn't give a shit
about me?"
"Please, Jim, no bad language," she said. "No, he
doesn't hate you, Jim. Not really. But he is afraid to face
you. He feels like he's a failure ..."

"Which he is!"
". . . as a husband and a father and a provider ..."
"Which he is!"
"... and he thinks you would attack him. He
says ... he says . . ."
"Say it! That I'm crazy!"
Eva put out her hand. "Please, Jim. I can't stand much
more of this. If it wasn't such a sin, unforgivable, I'd kill
myself!"
"You do whatever you think is best for you," he said, and
he walked out of the room. Her voice shrieked through the
doorway, "Jim! Don't do that!" Though he hesitated, he did
not turn back. When he got to his room, he sat down and
cried. Loneliness was a tide that swept him away over the
horizon, far from all human beings, to an island also called
Loneliness.
Even in his grief, he thought that that phrase would make
a great title for a song. "The Island Also Called Loneli-
ness."
The brain was a funny thing. In the midst of deep-purple
grief, it sent strange messages. Always working, working,
working simultaneously on many different subjects, and
why it semaphored reports about certain workings when the
timing was wrong, no one knew.
Or was the timing wrong? Maybe the brain was trying to
soften the grief by distracting itself from itself.
If so, the ruse worked only for a minute. Jim dived deep
into black and cold waters and would not come up for some
time. His fellow patients did their best for him. Doctor
Scaevola, who had taken over for Doctor Porsena while he
was gone to a three-day conference, tried to bring light to
Jim. He failed.
That very evening, just after the group session, Jim was
again called to the visitors' room. "Mr. and Mrs. Wyzak,"
772
the O.D. told him. "They aren't the bearer of good news,
Jim. Not the way they look."
The Wyzaks stood up as he came in. Mrs. Wyzak burst
into tears, ran to him, and enfolded him in her big strong
arms. His face was crushed against her big breasts. He
smelled a cheap perfume.
Mrs. Wyzak wailed, "Sam is dead!"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (116 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

Jim reeled inside himself. He felt numb. Her voice
became distant, and he seemed to be drowning in soft cotton
candy. Everything was floating away except for the breath-
stealing cottony stuff. He could see through it as through
many strips of gauze.
Nor could he cry. The tears that had flowed that afternoon
were all he had. The spring had run dry, and only the stone
from which the water had issued was left. It was cold, hard,
and dry.
He sat down while Mrs. Wyzak told him about Sam. Mr.
Wyzak sat voiceless, his head bent, his body sagging. Her
story was brief. Sam had run away. He had hitchhiked
several rides. The last one was with the driver of a
semitrailer. No one knew why it had happened, but the rig
had jackknifed, gone over the edge of a steep hill, and
rolled many times to the bottom. The driver had been badly
injured and was now in a coma. Sam had been thrown clear
of the cab but was crushed by the trailer. The funeral would
be in three days.
"I didn't want to just phone you," Mrs. Wyzak said,
dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. "I wanted to be
here when you got the news. You and Sam . . . you've
been best friends since you started walking."
She began sobbing. Jim did all he could to console her
though he did not share her heartache and grief. Nothing
was getting through to him. Sam's death seemed to have
taken place long ago.
773
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
When Doctor Porsena, after his return from the confer-
ence, had his first private session with Jim, he worked on
Jim's nonfeelings. Near the end of the hour, the doctor said,
"It's possible that you're suffering from doubly intensified
grief. You have a very vivid and visual-tactile-olfactory-
auditory imagination. Your journeys in the World of Tiers
are usually realistic and intense. There, you live as fully as
you do here.
"What I'm saying is . . ."
He paused, waiting for Jim to supply the explanations, if
he had any. Self-revelation was superior to that given by
another. The light should come from within.
Jim could see the white fingers groping around in the
blackness of his brain. What the hell did The Shaman
expect from him? Did he think an eighteen-year-old
screwup was Doctor Freud himself?
What was Porsena's key word? He gave such words to his
patients, though they were embedded in the various strata of
his sentences. If the patient could dig up the key and then
figure out how to use it, he could open the door to another
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (117 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

blaze of light.
Grief was a heavy liquid supposed to dilute memory. But
being Ore had improved his memory considerably. It was as if
some of the young Lord's near-photographic memory had
rubbed off on Jim. He could recall almost verbatim everything
Porsena had said during the session. So, run a scan. Let the
cursor stop at the key word or phrase and highlight it.
"Ah!" Jim said. "Double!"
The Shaman smiled.
" 'Doubly intensified grief,'" Jim said. "You think I have
an extra burden of grief. I got one load as Jim Grimson, and
I got another as Ore. Both of us were rejected—that's a mild
word—by our fathers. Both of us are in a bad fix. I don't
know about both of us having just lost our best friend. I
doubt Orc'll feel bad about Ijim dying."
774
RED ORC'S RAGE
Jim twisted his lips from one side to another. It was as if
he thought that moving the mouth would activate his brain.
Then the psychiatrist said, "Ijim is dead, as far as you
know. Is he the only loss?"
"Uh, well . . . let's see. There's, there's . . . how
about Ore himself?"
Porsena did not reply. He was leaving it up to his patient.
"I mean, I don't know if Ore's dead, too!" Jim said. "If
he is, then I've really lost! The whole ball of wax! That's
more grief than I can handle!"
"Others?" the doctor said.
"Grief . . . grief? Well, as Ore, and he's really me, and
I'm really him, I explained all that, there's my
mother ... I mean Enitharmon. Lost her. And I love
Aunt Vala, too. Lost her, also. I suppose their loss would be
strong. I know Ore certainly went through some grief about
maybe never seeing them again. But his grief got turned
into hate for his father. He . . ."
After a long silence. Doctor Porsena said, "He . . . ?"
"He did something about it. Just didn't sit down and cry
about it."
"Was that the right or wrong way to behave?"
"That's a . . ."
Jim had been about to say that it was a stupid question.
But he would not say that to The Shaman. Anyway, The
Shaman always had a reason for voicing anything, even if it
might seem irrelevant or dumb.
"Right, of course. Except ..."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (118 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

"Except?"
"It was the right way in that it was action taken to solve
the problem. Only, Ore was taking the most violent course.
I mean, he was going to kill his father and anybody else
who got in his way! Maybe he should have figured out a
better way. I don't know. It could be the only way there is."
775
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim blushed. That did not escape Porsena's eye. The
doctor said, "You're embarrassed."
Jim struggled with himself, then said, "OK. After all, it's
not like I'm having the incestuous thoughts Ore has. I sure
never had them about my own mother. Ore means to many his
mother after he kills his father—after some torture, that is.
He's also got the hots for his aunt. In fact. Ore's homier than
a pack of minks in heat. I told you he's screwed twenty of his
sisters, half-sisters, his father's children. All of them beautiful
even if they are ... oh, jeez, what am I saying?"
"Natives? Non-Lords? What the Lords call leblabbiyT'
"Yeah. I'm sorry. It's like the leblabbiy are ni ... I
mean, blacks. I didn't mean to use that word, you know. I
don't really think blacks are subhumans. But I grew up
hearing it everywhere."
"I know," the doctor said. "What're your thoughts about
the Lords' acceptance of incest?"
"Well, look. Doc ... I mean. Doctor. I've read a lot
about the ancient Egyptians, been doing it since I saw
Caesar and Cleopatra on TV. You know, the movie version
ofG.B. Shaw's play. With Claude Rains and Vivien Leigh.
I know that brothers and sisters of ancient Egypt's ruling
class married each other and had children. So did the Incan
rulers. Anyway, I think Farmer had something in the Tiers
books about brother-sister marriages. So, what with reading
about that and reading the books on Egypt and seeing the
movie, I didn't have much trouble accepting that. Anyway,
when I'm Ore, I tend to accept what he accepts. It's a
culture thing. The Lords don't have genetic defects, so
there's no problem passing bad genes on to their children.
So why shouldn't a mother marry her son?"
When the session ended, Jim felt only a very slight
lessening of the numbness and depression. Oh, well, it
didn't matter. Nothing mattered.
CHAPTER 22
JIM HAD SUNK into the very center of his own pocket
universe of depression. This was composed only of melan-
choly and self-despising, two elements that were not going
to make a sun to light up his world. He did what was
required of him—except to dive through the tragil—but
slowly and tiredly. Even then, he was counting the numerals
in the arithmetic of the night. He listed his flaws and
failures and did not stop until he got to number thirty-seven.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (119 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

He could recall all of them. Why not? He had spent much
time after the age of twelve contemplating them. Though
there had to be more flaws, these were enough to satisfy the
most self-pitying.
He did not get any sympathy from Doctor Porsena.
"You cannot continue to drag your chains around and
whine, 'Woe is me!' like some castle-haunting phantom.
You were making excellent progress—in fact, phenomenal.
Now, you've regressed. It's as if you've not only gone back
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
to the lowest previous point of lack of self-esteem in your
life, you've plunged below that. Reached that personal
nadir, as it were."
Jim summoned up enough spirit to say, "As opposed to
the Zenith, right? Well, I was never one for TV."
That took the psychiatrist aback for a moment. Then he
smiled, and he said, "If you've got enough fire to make a
pun, rotten as it is, there's still hope for you."
Jim did not think so. That remark was the last flicker of
a dying flame.
"What if Ore is dead?" Jim said. That question caught
him by surprise. It had shot out of his mouth as if something
had exploded in him.
Porsena's lips formed the ghost of a smile. He was, Jim
thought, not only The Shaman. He was The Sphinx. That
expression was exactly like the smile on the stone face of
the Great Sphinx of Giza. Jim could see the pyramids and
the palm trees beyond him. The wisdom of the ages was
behind that age-cut face and behind the doctor's, too.
"What if Ore is dead?" Porsena said. "You select
someone else to become."
At least Porsena had not argued with him that Ore was
only a fictional character. He must think that Ore was, but
he was going to play by Jim's rules. Never invalidate. That
was the Golden Rule, and Porsena was the Golden Ruler.
"I don't want to be someone else," Jim said.
"Then find out if Ore is dead or alive."
"I'll do it," Jim said. "I'll do it for you."
"No. You'll do it for yourself. You'll do it because it's
the thing to do for you and you only."
He leaned forward over his desk, his bright blue eyes
locked onto Jim's. "Listen up, Jim. I'm aware that I'm an
authority figure to you, perhaps a father/mother substitute.
That's good in one sense because you've reacted differently
RED ORC'S RAGE
to me than you have with other authority figures. You've

done your best to please me, though that is not necessarily
desirable. But I am here only to guide you through your
therapy. Perhaps that's too cold a way to put it. I like you,
and I think we might eventually become friends after your
therapy is complete. I do have authority, and I'm not your
peer. At the moment, I'm your superior, though I won't take
advantage of that—unless it's for your good.
"But we may have to work a bit to temper your attitude
toward me. I'm not God, I'm not your parents. I expect you
to hear my advice and then to use your judgment concerning
its value. Nevertheless, there'll be times when I'll override
your judgment. I am older and wiser, and I am a thoroughly
trained professional. However, I am human. I can make
mistakes and errors.
"On the other hand, I'll be far less likely than you to do
so. Keep all this in mind. We'll do some work on your
attitude, as I said. But your therapy is the big thing here.
So, I insist that you reenter Ore or pick another character to
enter. If you don't, your therapy will be ended. Do I make
myself clear?"
Jim nodded.
"What would Ore do if he were in your shoes just now?"
"Huh? Oh, I see what you mean! Sorry, I was thinking of
something else. If he was me, he'd've jumped right back
through the tragil. But I'm not him, not yet, anyway. Ore
never would've been in a depression. Not for long, anyway.
I know him, and ..."
"Do what he'd do, even if it seems to be against your
nature, no matter how hard it is to do. This isn't easy work,
you know."
"I'll try. Hard," Jim said.
He did not think he could do it, not in his state of mind.
But there were ways to alter those states. Porsena would not
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
approve those ways. In fact, taking any drugs except those
prescribed was forbidden on pain of immediate expulsion.
But desperate situations demanded desperate means. Before
the group session that afternoon, Jim got Gillman Sherwood
to one side in the main hallway.
"I hear you're dealing. Gill."
"Not at all," Sherwood said. "I wouldn't do that. Hell,
I'm here to get rid of the monkey, among other things."
"Let me put it this way," Jim said. "I understand you
may have access to certain cures for what ails me. I'd like
to get hold of one, preferably one of the speedy kind."
"It could be," Sherwood said. "But there are a lot of
rumors, mostly false, running around this place."
"Speed's the word," Jim said.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (121 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

"Might be what the doctor ordered. However, nothing's
free in this harsh world."
"I know the price," Jim said. "I got the wherewithal."
That morning, the mail had brought him a ten-dollar bill
along with a note from his mother. At first, he was tempted
to send both back. Yet, he needed money badly, so he had
put the bill in his pocket after tearing up the note. And here
he was, spending half of the ten on amphetamine when
every cent he had should go for absolute necessities. He
despised himself. At the same time he was looking forward
to the rush through his body and mind.
Gillman Sherwood put his hand on Jim's shoulder.
"There are other ways to pay debts than with money."
"Forget it!" Jim said. "I told you last time, no way!"
Gillman's smile was aloof and haughty, so superior. Jim
hated it, and he hated having to deal through this big prick.
Gillman said, "Don't knock it until you try it."
"Jesus Christ!" Jim said. "You've hit on every boy and
girl in the place! Do you love being turned down? Is that
part of your problem?"
180
"Hey, there's more than one here knows an offer they
can't refuse! I don't need you, Grimson, any more than I
need a wart on my ass! I'll slip you what you need when
we're alone next time. Bring the wherewithal. Otherwise,
no tickee, no shirtee."
What would Red Ore do? Probably kill Sherwood and
take his entire supply. Couldn't do that.
Though Sherwood's parents were wealthy, they sent him
little money. Thus, if he wanted extra cash, he had to deal
in nickel-and-dime stuff. His father had been a steel
magnate. Despite the shutting down of the industry in the
Youngstown area, he had interests in other businesses and
was said to own half of Belmont City. His only son had
seemed destined to be one of those tall, athletic, blond, and
handsome scions who would sweep through life untroubled
by the anxieties and dire straits of the great unwashed, the
rabble, the seething masses.
Not so. Even the extremely rich had problems they
shared with the lowly poor. Gillman was bisexual, with a
leaning toward males. If his gay-hating father had known
that, he would not have been so eager to make him into a
businessman. Gillman was passionate about becoming a
painter. The senior Sherwood was appalled by this. He
insisted that Gillman go to Harvard to get an M.B.A. and
then become his partner. If he wanted to paint as a
recreation, fine, though he should not brag about it to
anyone who might think only a pansy would be an artist. If
he wanted to be a patron, that was different.
Gillman, like so many now in therapy, had gone berserk.
He had slashed his wrists and painted a self-portrait with
blood. Then his drug-addiction had been revealed, and here
he was in the mental ward of Wellington Medical Center.

Jim would have empathized with Gillman if he did not act
as if he were the Duke of Kingdom Come. Jim also thought

that Gillman's choice of Wolff as his persona was a hoot.
Wolff would spit in the son of a bitch's face.
A few minutes later, he was talking to Sandy Melton. She
had not been able to get into a long conversation with him
since she had entered the project. She was classified as
schizoaffective and was now taking lithium carbonate. She
adored her Caucasian father though she did not see him
enough to satisfy her. He was a traveling salesman for a
large pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Bel-
mont City. Sandy detested her mother, who was Korean.
From early childhood. Sandy had suffered because so many
of her grade-school classmates had called her "slant-eyes,"
"Chink," "Jap," "gook," and "Mongolian idiot." Her
high-school friends had refrained from this, but her ac-
quaintances were not so discreet.
Yet, her long glossy black hair, uptilted eyes, and high
cheekbones made a beautiful whole. And, though only five
feet two inches tall, she had relatively long legs and a petite
but full-busted figure. Despite this, she thought that she was
ugly. Though shy, she had been a very energetic, sometimes
overzealous and near-frenzied business manager and agent
for the Hot Water Eskimos. But when she suddenly became
depressed, she was very withdrawn and lethargic. She
would then let her duties slide.
From an early age. Sandy had not liked her mother,
mostly because her mother had not seemed to like her. Kuo
Melton was surly, untalkative, and a bad housekeeper who
spent most of her time watching TV soap operas and game
shows. Though she had been in the United States for twenty
years, she spoke English very poorly.
Sometimes Sandy was in a forgiving mood, and she
would explain to her friends that her mother had had a hell
of a childhood and youth. She had been sexually abused and
half-starved and homeless for years before Abe Melton
182
married her. At that time, she was beautiful and looking for
a way out of her country. Sandy's father had told her that
Kuo was genuinely fond of him and he of her during the
early years of their marriage. That was certainly no longer
true.
Sandy's method of entering the World of Tiers was
unique. She would take all of her clothes off while chanting
the first four lines of the Buddhist Lotus Sutra over and
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (123 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
over. Then she would press her palms against the full-length
mirror on the wall of her room. While doing this, she would
use Jim's ATA MATUMA M'MATA chant. Two chants
were better than one. After about seven minutes (seven was
a magical and mystical number), and while she concen-
trated on the entry point five inches inside the mirror (five
was another mystical number), the glass would turn soft and
rubbery.
As soon as she felt the mirror become just a Jell-0, she
would begin muttering swiftly the words of the song "Over
the Rainbow." What was good enough for Dorothy of Oz
was good enough for her. And three chants were better than
one.
Her ectoplasm, as she called it, would travel through the
palms of her hands. It would fall forward through the
ever-thinning substance into the universe she had chosen.
When she had passed completely through, she (as ecto-
plasm) was in a male body. She had long wanted to be a
male because her father was, though she also felt that this
desire was morally wrong.
The universe beyond the mirror was like nothing de-
scribed in the Tiers series. It was flat, and she could fall off
its edge if she got too close to it. Its human inhabitants were
all Caucasian males, except for one gigantic female kept
under guard in a huge castle. She was like the queen termite
in a nest and was force-fed with a honey that made her so
183
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
large and so fat that she became larger than the kitchen in a
mansion. The queen was the mother of the entire human
population and bore five male babies in a single birth every
three months.
Once a year, a tournament was held—Sandy was a great
reader of medieval romances—and the champion became
the queen's lover and the begetter of that year's babies.
After he retired, he had to help other ex-champions take
care of the babies, dust the castle, wash dishes, and do other
household tasks. Being permitted to do this service was a
great honor.
Sandy, in her persona as Sir Sandagrain, roamed the
world in quest of the man who held the secret to everlasting
happiness. While wandering, she had to joust with innu-
merable knights, bad or good, and invade the many castles
of evil warlocks and robber barons. Like all males in this
world, they wore masks. So far. Sir Sandagrain had not
found The Man with the Golden Mask, he who had the
secret.

These adventures as the questing knight, though bloody
and perilous, helped to protect her against the sometimes
overwhelming stresses of Earth. When she felt she had had
enough relief from her terrestrial life, she pressed her palms
against the mirror. She repeated the same three chants in
reverse order. The Jell-0-like softness crystallized. At the
moment of complete hardness, it was ready to admit her
ectoplasm back to her female body.
Sandy was making some progress in her quest for a
stronger persona and lack of confusion about her sexual
identity. She was beginning to come out somewhat from the
wild swings of mood and her withdrawal tendencies. Like
Jim and most of the others, she was slowly surrendering her
own private and uncontrolled delusions to the controlled
delusions of the World of Tiers.
184
"Jim, I've talked to my dad twice," she said excitedly.
"He's always talked about divorcing Kuo, but it was just
talk. He's very resistant to the idea of divorce. But now, I
don't know, he may be coming around to it. He knows how
much I hate leaving the hospital and going back to that
house. It's terrible. But only because Kuo's there!"
Sandy never referred to Kuo as her mother.
"Aren't you thinking about adapting yourself to Kuo?"
Jim said.
"No. I couldn't do that unless she went into therapy, too,
and did some changing herself. Takes two to tango, you
know. She would never do that."
, The dining hall was noisy, though it had quiet spots
occupied by withdrawn juveniles. Jim and Sandy sat down
across the table from a lovely, gentle, and fragile girl,
Elizabeth Lavenza. Her stepfather had been sodomizing her
since she was ten years old. Several months ago, the
monster, as Elizabeth always called him, had tried to kill
her when he had caught her phoning the police. She had
managed to fight him off by jamming the receiver into his
mouth and then hitting him over the head with a poker.
These were the only violent acts she had ever committed,
and she was suffering from guilt because of them. (This
reaction was totally incomprehensible to Jim.) She had then
run out of the house and down the street. Despite her
stepfather's injuries, he had lurched after her swiftly enough
to catch her. He was strangling her when the squad car
arrived.
Elizabeth used what she called her "powerpack" to enter
the Lords' universes. This was the five books of the series
taped together, forming her battery to energize the opening
of the way. Several others in the therapy did the same.
Near Jim was another table at which sat the members of
a group in which he was particularly interested. These were

whispering, their heads as close together as they could get
them. Their universe was one they had made up with the
help of Doctor Porsena. Though it was nominally in the
World of Tiers, it was not one that its author would have
been likely to create. This was ruled by a Lord called
Kephalor. He was a brain the size of a pocket universe
because he was also the universe. Its inhabitants were
electrical entities whose forms were the neural impulses of
Kephalor's brain. In fact, the group called itself The Neural
Impulses. (Jim thought that this would be a great name for
a rock band.)
It had been agreed among the members that, when
Kephalor forgot something, an impulse would die. That
meant that the member embodying that impulse would also
die. But he or she could return as a new thought, though his
or her identity would be different.
Jim had heard that the harmony in the group had turned
a little sour. One member was claiming that she and she
only was Kephalor's subconscious mind. Since the subcon-
scious ruled the conscious, the other neural impulses would
have to do as she commanded. This demand was to be
expected. One of the behavior characteristics that had
brought the girl to Wellington was her irrepressible desire to
control others.
After lunch, Gillman Sherwood and Jim stepped around
a hall comer. No one else was in sight. Gillman held out
five black beauties, uppers, in the palm of his hand.
"Normal price is two dollars each. But my first customers
get a discount. Only a dollar each."
Jim handed him the ten-dollar bill at the same time that he
took the capsules. Gillman opened his wallet, which was
packed with paper currency, and made change for Jim.
"Welcome back to the real world," Sherwood said.
786
RED ORC'S RAGE____
"This is just temporary," Jim muttered. "I need it to get
over a hump. After that ..."
Sherwood smiled. "Sure. But if the temporary becomes
permanent, I'm your man."
Jim, hating Sherwood and himself, turned and walked
away. That evening, he sat for a long time while looking at
the black beauties, which did not seem so beautiful now.
What would Ore do? Jim really did not know. Now and
then. Ore had remembered, briefly, the ecstasy gotten from
certain drugs. But Jim had also received the impression that
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (126 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

these had no bad side effects and were not chemically
addictive.
In any event, Ore needed no drugs to give him courage.
And then there was Doctor Porsena. No doubt at all, he
would be very disappointed if his patient went back over the
edge. Not that, Jim told himself, he had ever been really
hooked. He was not a "dope fiend," as his father called
drug-takers. He just used the stuff now and then. Though,
to be honest to himself, he had been using uppers and
downers and smoking marijuana more than he had last year.
Still, he was a long way from jumping onto the bandwagon
called Hooked.
Or was he?
After a half hour, he sighed, and he rose from the chair.
He flushed the capsules down the toilet, though not without
regret.
Ten minutes later, he shot through the circle in the center
of the tragil.

CHAPTER 23
URC WAS WRITHING in agony on a glittering and hard floor.
Since there was no one else there, he did not have to play
the stoic. He screamed.
Jim suffered as much as Ore, which did not seem fair since
he had no body. He should go back to Earth at once until Ore's
pains were gone. Unfortunately, he could not concentrate on
the techniques needed to effect the return. By the time he could
do that, he would be able to endure the pain.
Though half-blinded by the fire in the backs of his heels
and in his buttocks. Ore could see that he was in a vast
tunnel. Its walls shone with the light from a multitude of
six-angled, vaguely insectoid creatures hanging on the
walls. Additional illumination came from round knobs on
the ceiling, walls, and floor. Intermingled with them were
thick patches of green stuff that looked like lichen.
In the middle of the tunnel was a deep trough through
which clear water ran. Ore, standing on his toes, walked
188
stiffly to the stream, lay down in it, and immersed himself up
to his neck. The water was very cold and shocked him. It also
gave relief as it chilled his blood and somewhat soothed his
pain.
Sitting there. Ore could see the bloody footprints he had
made on the crystalline floor. As he had hopped through the
gate, the extreme tips of his heels and buttocks had been

sheared off by the ray. They would heal in time, but was he
going to get that time?
That depended, just now, on how much blood he was
going to lose. Also, if he survived that, how far he could
walk while looking for food and then the gate. Unless, that
is, the gate was nearby. He doubted that it would be.
Los had said that the gate in Anthema would lead back to
Ore's native world. He had lied. There was no such place as
this on or in that planet.
Ore crawled out onto the tunnel floor, which was a few
inches above the surface of the stream. The agony would
come back when he got warm again, but he could no longer
stand the cold. He wished he had cloths, anything, to
bandage his wounds.
He saw the front half of Ijim's body. It was lying
facedown. Ore, when coming through the gate, had landed
on it and skidded on the organs and blood.
Ore was wearing a skin loincloth and a belt with a sheath
and a flint knife therein. All the other weapons and the food
supply bag had been left behind. He walked on his toes,
wincing at every step, and stripped the half-corpse of its
severed loincloth and belt and a knife. This was now a
half-knife, since the ray had cut it longitudinally, but it might
be useful.
With his own knife, he pried off pieces of the green stuff
growing on the wall. Beneath them were small tubes
projecting from the crystal. It seemed to him that these
789
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
might be conduits which fed the plants. When he saw some
yellow liquid starting to ooze from the tips of the tubes, he
thought that his idea could be correct.
He wrung the fluid out of the plants, which felt like thick
wet moss. He decided to call it omuthid, Thoan for moss,
and placed pieces of it on the wounds. That made him
wince, but they stuck to his skin as if they contained glue.
The flow of blood was stanched. Then he ate a small bite of
another piece of omuthid stripped from the wall. It was rich
with fluid, easily chewed, and tasted like caramel mixed
with raw broccoli. Though it might be poisonous, he did not
care. Not at this moment, anyway. If he did not get sick
from this piece, he would eat more of it later.
What was left of Ijim's body could be a protein supply,
for a while, anyway. If Ore had not known the Lord so well,
he might have eaten him. But, though he felt that he might
regret doing it, he shoved the half-corpse into the stream,
which carried it away.
He would be stuck in this area until his wounds healed
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (128 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
enough for him to walk easily. Normally, three days would do
it. Meanwhile, he would eat, sleep, drink water, and hope that
no predator came along. He had no way to estimate the time
except by his sleeping requirements. It seemed to him that
roughly three days had passed since he had been here. During
this period, he explored, mostly on tiptoes, a quarter mile each
way. He found nothing that he had not seen near the gate. He
also investigated this. The square of metal looked the same on
this side as it did on the other. He made a rope of the omuthid
and threw one end through the gate. The part that went through
the gate was cut off.
Because of the wounds, he had to sleep on his face on the
hard crystalline floor. Unfortunately, he rolled and turned
then, and he awoke often and painfully. The only good
thing about his situation was that the temperature remained
790
RED ORC'S RAGE
comfortable. Also, the air did not become stale but moved
slowly through the tunnel.
Each "day," after awakening, he removed the omuthid
patches from the wounds and replaced them with fresh
pads. They came off as if they were indeed glued. The
wounds were healing, but the areas of skin covered by the
patches were pricked with many red dots. They looked as if
the omuthid had applied tiny suckers to the skin, and the
green stuff had a distinct reddish underlay. At the end of the
three days, he concluded that the omuthid was sucking his
blood, though not in large quantities. He was not as strong
as when he had entered this world. Of course, his diet might
be lacking in vitamins and minerals.
Nevertheless, he could walk without too much pain, and
he could sit down for several minutes before he had to
remove his buttocks from pressure. After another sleep, he
set out upstream as instinctively as a salmon seeking its
hatching place. The tunnel ran straight for an estimated
twenty miles, which he traversed after sleeping only once.
The light stayed steady, as it had done since he had been
here. The tunnel was silent except for the drumming of his
blood in his ears. To get rid of that, he began talking to
himself and also sang often.
The feeling of loneliness and the thought that he might be
here until he died kept him company. It was not the sort of
company he cared for.
Finally, he came to a fork in the tunnel. At the base of the
wall between the two tunnels was a bubbling pool. Along one
side of each of the forks was a shallow trough through which
water ran. These emptied into the pool, but the bubbling and
the swirling in it indicated that it was also fed by a spring.
Ore took the tunnel to his right. After a while, it widened
and became as big as that which he had left. He trudged on,
singing a song his mother had taught him when he was a

child. Suddenly, he stopped, and he turned to face the
left-side wall. Something flickering along the wall, halfway
down its height, had caught his eye.
Whatever it was had ceased, but he kept his head turned
toward the wall while he walked on. Then, he stopped
again. His brain had not been playing tricks on him, not
unless he had gone crazy from solitude. A series of large
black figures, symbols, perhaps, moved in a rather speedy
parade along the wall. They came from behind him and
traveled ahead of him until he could no longer see them.
They ceased for a few minutes. Or perhaps it was for an
hour. Ore had lost his sense of time. Only when he counted
the seconds and the minutes could he be sure of its passage.
Suddenly, the first of a series of the symbols, many of
them repeated in different combinations, sped along on the
wall. Parts of them were obscured when they passed
beneath the omuthid and knobs. After several hundreds had
sped by, they stopped. Ore resumed walking. Some time
later, another series began. Ore counted the seconds then.
The train took thirty-one to pass him.
If they made a message, its transmission was slow. But he
was quickened by it. No natural process could produce such
distinct and differentiated figures in an obviously artificial order.
Some minutes later, another string of the same symbols,
repeated in the same arrangement, shot by. After that, the
wall was blank.
Ore hastened onward. The tunnel curved gradually to the
right until it seemed to be going at right angles to its original
direction. When he got very tired, he stopped and ate. By
now, he was sick of the taste of caramel-cum-broccoli.
Jim Grimson was as fed up as Ore with the omuthid.
When the Lord ate it, Jim ate it. Ore's problems were also
Jim's. But Jim had others, too. The ghostbrain, his shadowy
cotenant, seemed to be getting larger. Now that Ore was just
792
sitting and chewing, no emotions raging in him, though his
mind was active, he was in a relatively quiescent state. Thus,
Jim was able to concentrate on his own thoughts and act as he
wished. But he was still half Ore and likely, when his host was
aroused or irate, to be slammed back into a near-Ore persona.
Jim "moved" closer to the ghostbrain. It "retreated." There
could be no movement in the physical sense, just as there
could be no "seeing" or "hearing" or "touching" by beings
without limbs or sensory organs. Jim "knew," however, that
he had advanced and that the ghostbrain had backed away.
He continued to go toward the thing. It kept on moving
away. Was it afraid of him? Perhaps Jim was dangerous to
it. If that was so, he would have to find out how it could be
attacked. Easy to say; hard to do.

Ore slept, ate with little appetite, and started walking
again. Presently, the tunnel opened into a vast glittering
cavern. The growths furnishing the light were far more
numerous per square foot and larger than those in the
tunnels. Also—what a delight—there was sound! Many
small birds or animals lived among various plants and
twittered, squealed, trumpeted, and cawed.
The creatures looked as ifTenniel had been on LSD when
he had illustrated Alice in Wonderland. Or as if they had
been designed by a deity whose own god was Euclid. They
were many-angled, some of them long-legged cubes or
nonahedrons on wheels, their skins spotted with triangles,
circles, squares, and crosses.
The plants looked as if they were part crystal, part vegeta-
ble. Some of them bore berries or hexagonal fruit. The green
mosslike omuthid was everywhere, on the floors, walls, and
ceiling. At least a hundred feet above him was the ceiling, and
the cavern itself extended beyond his eye's reach.
Standing on a ledge about twenty feet above the cavern's
floor. Ore could see several creeks. They did not run straight,
as in the tunnels, but meandered as proper creeks should.

He had been taken with the ecstasy of the sounds of living
creatures. Shortly thereafter, he was seized with a rapture
caused by sight of a human being. He was naked and walking
slowly through the forest toward Ore. But he did not seem to
be aware that an intruder was in his exotic Garden of Eden.
Ore had to fight against rushing down and greeting the man.
He crouched down close to a boulder and studied the person as
he made his way through the plants. There was something
peculiar about him. He did not seem to have a quite human
construction. His gait was unhurried and stately as if he owned
this world, which, indeed, he might. When the man was
closer, the details of his face and body became clearer.
He walked slowly and dignifiedly because he could not
walk otherwise. The joints of his shoulders, hips, elbows,
knees, and wrists were bulbous and somewhat shiny. And
the head, neck, and trunk were larger than they would be in
a normally proportioned man.
Ore shook his head. He had been momentarily under an
illusion. His imagination had supplied what the man did not
have because Ore expected him to have it. Where Ore had
seen male genitals was now a smooth place, skin dotted
with gleaming crystals. The he was an it.
It had no weapons, though. Ore stood up and shouted
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (131 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

through cupped hands at the being. It stopped, though it did
not look startled. Then the mouth opened. It could have
been a smile, but its teeth shone like jewels.
Ore climbed down and walked to the creature, which had
resumed its slow pace. When they were ten feet apart, they
halted. Ore greeted it in Thoan. "Koowar!"
It said, "Koowar-su shemanithoon!"
"Greetings and come in peace!"
The teeth were white diamonds and obviously had been
made in a biofactory. They had been fashioned so that they
resembled human canines, incisors, and molars.
794
"Neth Ore," the young Lord said. "I am Ore."
"Neth Dingsteth."
The being's name was Dingsteth, one Ore had never
heard before. It spoke with a slight impediment. No doubt
the diamond teeth caused that.
To Ore's rapid-fire questions, Dingsteth responded slowly.
In due time. Ore learned that this world had been made by the
Lord called Zazel. Zazel of the Cavemed World. He was also
the maker of Dingsteth, who was now the only sentient being
in an entire universe. The world consisted of rock perforated
with tunnels and caves, some of which had floor areas a
thousand miles square. But it was, in a sense, a living being.
It did not seem to have a consciousness. Or, if it did, it had
given no sign of one to Dingsteth.
"It's a vast semimineral-semiprotein computer in which
many different forms of life exist. Half of the fauna and
flora herein are symbiotes of the world of Zazel. I'll explain
all that later. It detected your presence and notified me. I
am, in reality, the Lord of this world even if I did not make
it. Perhaps you saw the message traveling along the wall?
It's a very slow computer."
"I saw the message. What happened to Zazel?"
"He killed himself. He went mad. Or madder. I think he
was crazy from the beginning. Who else but an insane
person would create this kind of world? But he had an easy
death. He let the computer suck his blood, drain him dry.
Then, as he had ordered me to do, I cremated him."
Dingsteth looked at Ore from head to toe, then said,
"Turn around, please."
"What?" Ore said. "Why should I?"
"Tell you later. Please do as I requested."
Frowning, Ore rotated. He had never obeyed anybody's
orders except his parents', and, for some years, he had

disliked doing that. He was a Lord, and Lords commanded,
not non-Lords.
Dingsteth did not nod because the swollen ring which
was its neck prevented that. It said, "Good! So far! There
are no indications of crystallization!"
At Ore's somewhat alarmed question, Dingsteth said, "If
you're active enough, your metabolism is able to stave off
the crystallization of your flesh. But you have to sleep, and
it is then that the cells slowly begin to turn into stone."
"What kind of a world is this?" Ore said. At the same
time, he decided that he was going to get out of it as quickly
as possible. "And how have you kept from being crystal-
lized?" he added.
"Zazel made me so that I have an innate resistance, a
biological defense."
"Is there a gate out of the Cavemed World?"
"There could be. I may be able to find out for you. I have
access to all the tremendous amount of data that Zazel
stored in the world."
Ore was not accustomed to being humble, but this
situation demanded that he be. He was not going to risk his
survival just because of his pride. He would bend, though
not break it, if he had to.
"Would you find out for me?"
"Why not?" Dingsteth said. "I will unless some reason for
not doing so occurs to me or I find the reason in the computer."
"Thank you. One immediate question, though. How did
Los manage to penetrate this world and set up the gate I
used to get here?"
"Los?"
Ore told his story.
Dingsteth said, "The fatal flaw in Thoan culture is that
the children of the Lords of a particular world want to be its
sole ruler. That desire was understandable and feasible in
796
ancient days when the Lords had the means to create new
worlds. Then the children, when they became adult, could
move out of their parents' universes into their own. Now,
they are restricted to those worlds already made. If they
knew that the means for making new worlds still existed,
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (133 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

they could abandon their bloody conflict. That has kept
their population down considerably, as you know, and is
responsible for your present plight. If the Thoan were
logical, they would get rid of that cultural trait."
"Hold it!" Ore said excitedly. "You said that the means
for making new worlds still exists! Where?"
"Here. I did not mean that the creation engines are still
around. I meant that this world has the data for making new
ones. Not only the instructions for operation but how to
make the materials needed and how to construct them and to
supply them with power. Et cetera."
"You can access all this?"
"Of course."
Ore shook his head, then rolled his eyes. "All this time!
The knowledge has been thought lost for thousands of
years! And it's here! In this desolate and undesired world!"
"It's not such a bad place," Dingsteth said.
"I apologize if I hurt your feelings," Ore said. "I've only
been here a short time, so I shouldn't judge the place with
the little data I have of it. But you must understand that it's
not my kind of place. Anyway, I'm eager to get back to my
own world, for reasons I've explained."
"I don't understand revenge," Dingsteth said. "The
capability for that was left out of me when I was made. A
good thing, too, I think. By the way, the video data of your
father setting up that gate you came through are stored in the
world's memory. Would you care to see them?"
"I was wondering how he managed to gate into and out
of this world."

PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"I let him in. I am always curious, and I wanted to talk to
him and fmd out all about him. He was the first in centuries to
try to get in. Zazel did not play the game you Lords play. He
set up codeless gates, though they can be opened from this
side. I permitted Los to come in, but I was disappointed in
him. He was in a hurry, so he said, but he promised to come
back later. He never did, and that was over five hundred years
ago. Evidently, he's not to be trusted. When you first men-
tioned his name, it didn't register. But, as we've been talking,
I recalled him. I ..."
Ore said, "You didn't tell him about the creation engine
data, did you?"
"No. The subject didn't come up during our brief
conversations. I would have, but ..."
"Dingsteth," Ore said, "Listen to me! Hear my words of
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (134 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

advice and caution! Do not ever tell anybody else about the
engines! If you do, you might be killed—after you've
shared that knowledge! There are many Thoan who would
like to get the secret and keep it for themselves! They would
torture you, then slay you."
"How about you?" Dingsteth said.
"I would be very grateful if you would show me that
data, then open the gate long enough for me to pass on to
Los's world."
"You did not answer my question," Dingsteth said.
"Which means, I'm afraid, that you are concealing from me
some of your intents and purposes. I don't know you well
enough to understand your personality. But, if it's like most
of the other Lords, Manathu Vorcyon is a notable excep-
tion, you'd be thinking about killing me after you learn all
you can about the creation engines."
Ore had to laugh. Then he said, "Zazel certainly made
you an open and exceedingly frank person!"
"If I told you how to operate, rather, cooperate, with this
198
RED ORC'S RAGE
world, you would have to give some of your blood to get the
data you desire. You have to apply your face to a monitor-
input and let it suck your blood before it'll give you what you
want. But it wouldn't let you go unless you knew certain
codes, which I am not going to tell you. You'd be sucked dry."
"Just tell me how to gate out," Ore said. "That's all I
want."
He was thinking—Jim was aware of this—that he would
return some day in a small armed vehicle and get the
information. Dingsteth was the only one who could let him
in, but Ore would find a way to cajole it into doing that. Or
he would come back through the kamanbur gate.
He said, "Why did you admit my father? Also, why did
you let him set up a gate which kills others when they try to
get through it?"
"Why not? What do I care? As it stands, you're the first
Lord to get through. Your uncle, Ijim, did not make it through,
and the chances are that the next one to try it will fail. It'll be
interesting to observe those who follow you, if any ever do."
Ore did not want to dwell on the gate. Dingsteth might
get the idea that it would be a good thing to remove it
because of the possible danger for itself. Another possibility
was that Dingsteth might lack the means to dismantle it.
Also, Los would have set up the gate so that anybody trying
to dismantle it would be killed.
Dingsteth looked as if it had been encoiled in thought,
too. Suddenly, it said, "I'll go with you!"
Ore was surprised. After a long silence, he said, "Why?"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (135 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

"I know everything about this world. I am bored with it.
Zazel did not set me up to be invulnerable against that. As
for loneliness, I do not know what that means. Zazel made
me so that that feeling, which afflicts all humans, is absent
from me. I only know that because the world told me, and
I've no idea what loneliness feels like.

"I do have an intense curiosity. I need other worlds to
feed that. Therefore, I will go with you. You can be my
guide and instructor until I am able to proceed on my own.
In return for your services, I will let you pass through the
gate and I'll go with you and provide you with much data."
How naive it was! Ore thought. No matter how much
knowledge the being had, it was, in many respects, igno-
rant. It did not know that, once Ore got to his native world,
it would be a burden. He could not afford to have it
wandering around and perhaps telling the natives that Los's
son was back and seeking revenge. Also, Dingsteth should,
for Ore's purposes, remain in the Cavemed World. It could
open the gate for him when he returned to get a creation
engine. Which, Ore now remembered, could be reversed to
become an engine of destruction. Or so the historians said.
He would have to string Dingsteth along until the
moment of departure. Perhaps he could get it to stay here
but also promise to let him back in when next he showed up.
Dingsteth said, "Wait here."
It returned ten minutes later. Ore had thought of follow-
ing it to watch it, but he decided against that. From the little
information he had gotten, he thought that the walls were in
league with the being. Their monitors would see him
following Dingsteth and report that to it.
"I gave some blood, and the world agreed to open the
gate for us," it said. Its upper lip bore a small wound. "Let
us go now."
Ore walked with it to the other end of the cavern and down
a tunnel. At the end of approximately thirty minutes, the being
stopped. Ore looked around. There was nothing to differenti-
ate this area from any other. Dingsteth placed its hand on the
near wall. The wall here was free of the omuthid. After several
seconds, it said, "The gate is now open."
There still seemed to be nothing except glittering crys-
200
talline stone before them. Ore was about to say something
when Dingsteth plunged its hand through the stone up to his
ring-shaped wrist. "See?"
"You may go first," Ore said. His politeness was actually
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (136 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
caution. He still did not trust the being; it might be asking
him to step into a fatal trap.
"Very well," Dingsteth said. Its voice seemed very tight,
and its face was set in an unreadable expression.
It walked forward but stopped just before its nose
encountered the wall. For a long time, while Ore, puzzled,
watched it, it stood still. Then it stepped back, hesitated,
and advanced again. Only to halt a half-inch from the wall.
Finally, Dingsteth turned toward Ore. "I can't do it!" it
said, and it groaned.
"Why?" Ore said. His distrust might be well-founded. A
trap could be, probably was, on the other side.
"For the first time in my life," it said, "I am afraid. Until
now, I've never known what apprehension and fear meant,
though I've read those words in the records. Zazel must
have put those states in me because a being without fear and
caution eventually perishes.
"The moment we started out toward the gate, I began
feeling very strange emotions. My heart began pounding,
my stomach seemed to grab itself and try to fold itself into
itself, and I began shaking. The closer we got, the worse the
symptoms were. At this moment ..."
Its teeth began chattering. The sound of diamonds click-
ing against diamonds was one which Ore would never forget.
Finally, Dingsteth mastered itself enough to stop shivering.
"I can't!" it wailed. "I feel as if something on the other
side will destroy me if I go there! I feel ... I feel as if a
great void will be waiting for me! I'll step through the gate
and fall into an immense space and fall and fall! Then I'll hit
the bottom and be broken, smashed, into a thousand pieces!
207
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
And that's very peculiar, you know! I don't even know what
a vast space would look like! I've lived in this enclosed and
straitened world all my life and have no idea what a really
large space would be!"
"You're suffering from intense cases of agoraphobia and
acrophobia," Ore said. He was, however, wondering ifDingsteth
was putting on an act to get him to go through the gate first.
"I know those words, but, until now, I never knew what
their true meaning was! What it is, it's fear of the unknown!
I am unable to leave this world! I just can't, I just can't!"
Ore was not going to coax it through the gate. And he
might as well take advantage of it while its wits whirled
around as if in a centrifuge.
"Listen, Dingsteth! Your curiosity and desire for new

knowledge drive you to leave this place. These are valuable
factors. Your excessive fear of the unknown is a crippling
aspect of your persona. It's a mental sickness, and I know
you cannot conquer it by yourself. I'll tell you what I'm
going to do. When I return, I promise I will, I'll bring a
drug that will suppress that fear. Then you'll be able to
venture forth and do what you want to do."
"That would be thoughtful of you," Dingsteth said.
"Only . . . I'm not sure that any drug could overcome
this great fear."
"I promise you it will."
"But I'm not sure that I want to take any such drug. It
could make me do something that would kill me!"
"I'll bring it, and you can take it or not, depending on
how you feel about it."
Ore did not care whether or not Dingsteth used the drug.
All he wanted was for the being to let him back through the
gate. He would have to test its existence himself. To throw
Dingsteth through the gate to activate a trap was to put Ore
in a losing position, whatever happened. If the being died,
202
RED ORC'S RAGE
it could not admit him when he returned. If there was no
trap, Dingsteth would be horrified and forever offended It
would never allow him in after that.
"I will bring back the drug," Ore said.
"I'll admit you so I can try it," the being said. "At least,
I think I will. Good concatenation of events for you Ore
son of Los and Enitharmon!"
"For you, too," Ore said.
He stepped through the gate that was also a crystalline
wall.

CHAPTER 24
URC WAS NOT in Los's world. His father had not told him
the truth about the gate on Anthema leading back to his
native universe. Or had Los lied or just been misleading?
Ore had gone from Zazel's Cavemed World to one which
the local natives called Lakter. After a while. Ore realized
that the Thoan knew it as Jakadawin Tar. That is, Jadawin's
World. It had once been Thulloh's World, that is, Thulkaloh
Tar. But Jadawin had gotten through the gate-traps, and
Thulloh had been forced to gate out to save his life.
Lakter was a planet where the stars "seemed" to swarm
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (138 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

through the night sky like fireflies. Ore thought "seemed"
because so many things in the pocket universes were
illusions. The gate was in a cave at the foot of a mountain
on a large tropical island. Ore had gone down through the
jungle to the seashore. After watching the natives for some
days, he had revealed himself to them. They were peaceful
and friendly, though they had some customs that Ore thought
were bizarre and sometimes brutal.
204
The Poashenk language was not derived from Thoan. He
learned it quickly enough despite encountering some sounds
unknown to him until then. He lived in a hut made of
bamboolike wood and grass with a good-looking woman,
hunted and fished, ate well, slept much, and healed his
body. His soul was not so quickly repaired. Despite his
seeming patience, he burned to find the next gate. After he
became fluent in Poashenk, he questioned all who claimed
to know something about the world outside the island. That
was little and was mostly half-legend.
Meanwhile, his brown-skinned hosts gave him a drug,
aflatuk, made from the juices of three plants. Ore drank it
and also smoked the shredded bark of the somakatin plant.
Both put him in a pleasant and dreamy state where he
moved and thought in slow motion. The taste of a fruit or of
roasted meat lasted for hours, or seemed to. Orgasms
seemed to span both ends of eternity. Eternity, of course, in
reality had no beginning or end—unless you had taken in
aflatuk juice and somakatin smoke. Then you saw the start
and the finish of what could not be begun or finished.
Ore might have tried the drugs just once or perhaps
several times and then quit. But these two had no bad
aftereffects, and he was told that they did not hook the user.
It was some time before he observed that the tribe's adults
did not have good memories. Then Ore's wife had a
miscarriage, and he found out that miscarriages were rather
frequent. Though he noted these facts, he was not disturbed
much by them. However, when he began missing his aim
while hunting—he had always been a superb archer—he did
get alarmed. And when he began to forget significant items,
he was even more perturbed. But these mental upsets passed
with time.
On certain days, the Poashenks traveled to other villages
of the super-tribe of Skwamapenk for ritual festivals or just
205
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
to have a good time. Ore saw that the five tribes meeting for
these occasions were equally hooked on aflatuk and so-
makatin.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (139 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

It was not until the fifth festival that he felt a vague
alarm. The revelation was slow in coming, but, when it did,
it jolted him, though not strongly. Hooked. All the users of
the drugs were hooked, and that included himself!
That night, despite the painful urgings to drink the juice
and smoke the bark, he resisted. Without saying good-bye
to anybody, he put out to sea in his dugout. Though he had
food and water, he did not take any of the drugs.
The next day, he regretted leaving the aflatuk and
somakatin behind. Why had he been so stupid? Before
nightfall, the craving was twisting his body with agony, and
his cries were swept away by the wind, heard only by
himself and a few seabirds. He was being carried away from
the island, and he had no idea where other land was.
Willingly or not, he was taking the cold turkey cure.
Jim Grimson also suffered, agonized, and, figuratively,
bit his own wrists and tore at his flesh with his fingers. He,
with Ore, screamed, saw demons rising from the sea and
vast menacing ghostly figures looking down from the
clouds, and felt as if his flesh was gnawing into his bones
and spitting pieces out and the bones were trying to eat their
way through the flesh to his skin while being eaten by the
flesh.
Between these tortures. Ore, hence Jim, plunged into
abysmal depressions. Ore saw himself sitting on the dugout
bow and grinning at him. The strange thing about this vision
was that it told him that, in some perverted way, he was
enjoying his depressions.
He came close to leaping into the sea to end it all.
Then, suddenly, he suffered no more. The drugs had fled
his body. He was weak, gaunt, and thirsty from not eating
206
and drinking, but he had won one battle. No. He had won
the war. He swore that never again would he take any drugs.
Unfortunately, during his deliriums, he had thrown the
food and water supplies overboard. He now had a war
against thirst and starvation to wage. He would have lost
this if a ship had not rescued him. This, however, was
manned by slavers. He was shoved into the hold and
manacled along with several hundred other unfortunates.
His captors were very tall men from the far east of the
large landmass reported by the Poashenks. They were
lighter-skinned than the islanders and armed with steel
weapons. Their vessel was equipped with sails and with
oars to be used when the wind was light or nonexistent.
The slaver-pirates made two raids on a large island. With
the ship packed to overcapacity with slaves, they sailed for
three weeks northward. Ore survived the horrors of the
hold. He was not sure that he would live through the
slavehood itself. He was sold to a grower of a hemplike
plant and put to work in the fields. The labor from dawn to
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (140 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

dusk under the killer sun, the bad food, the unremitting
humiliation, and the busy whips of the overseers put a
heavy strain on his patience and toleration.
He knew what the penalty was for not obeying orders
completely and industriously. He realized what talking back
to the overseers or even being slightly surly would bring on
him. He still had to control himself with great effort. He
observed everything carefully, and he looked for ways and
means to escape.
Jim Grimson not only shared Ore's sufferings, he had his
own. He had stuck to Ore no matter what ordeals and
dangers the Lord went through. When the agonies of
withdrawal came, they were too much for Jim. He chanted
the release phrase. He remained in Ore's mind. Horrified,
he tried again and again. He could not get loose. Then he
207
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
was swallowed up in the self-rending and the brain-fever
nightmare visions and deliriums. He was too much Ore to
be Jim Grimson.
After the withdrawal agonies were gone, Jim thought that
he could now spring himself and return to Earth. But he
decided that he could hang on and in a little longer. He
endured the slave ship because Ore did not find the ordeal
unendurable. For the same reason, Jim stayed while Ore
was a plantation slave.
One day, he concluded that he had had too much too
long. He would leave. When enough time had passed for
the situation to change, he would return.
Again, he was horrified because he could not tear himself
away. Now, though, the ghostbrain was holding him. It had
moved closer and had "seized" Jim with phantom pincers.
Somehow, Jim knew that it had put forth something similar
to a crab's claws and clamped them down on him.
After that, the ghostbrain did nothing. It seemed content,
for a while, anyway, just to hold on to him. Jim was
anything but content. He struggled. He chanted. He cried
aloud, figuratively, to a God he did not believe in. All was
in vain.
Shortly after this. Ore rebelled. He had not planned to do
so; he just stepped over, or was forced to step over, his limit
of endurance. His overseer, Nager, did not like any slave in
his gang, and he particularly disliked Ore. He made fun of
Ore's white skin, spat on him, lashed him more than he did
the other slaves and for lesser offenses, and always put Ore
on double duty when that was needed.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (141 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

That late afternoon, just after Nager had told the water
bearer not to give Ore a drink because he did not look
thirsty. Ore reached out and lifted the whole bucket to his
mouth. The next second, he was knocked down. Nager's
foot drove into his stomach. Then he brought the whip
208
down on Ore's back. The young Lord took six lashes before
he saw red. He jumped up through the scarlet cloud that
seemed to envelop everything, and he kicked Nager in the
crotch.
Before the other overseers and some guards could get to
him. Ore snapped Nager's neck.
Despite his struggles, during which he killed a guard and
crippled an overseer, he was brought down to the ground.
The chief overseer, pale under his dark pigment, almost
frothing at the mouth, ordered that Ore be beheaded at once.
The slaves, having abandoned their duties to watch, had
formed a ring around Ore and the men who held him. They
were a silent group, but their faces revealed their hatred.
There was not one among them who would not have done
what Ore did if they had been able to do it.
Ore was on his knees, his trunk bent forward, his hands
gripped behind him, his head pushed forward. The chief
overseer had unsheathed his long sword and was approach-
ing Ore. He was saying, "Hold him steady! One cut, and
I'll take his head to the master!"
Jim was more than just terrified. If Ore died, he would
die. He was convinced of that. He screamed out the
releasing phrase and made the most violent mental effort of
his life, which lately had been filled with such.
He had the sensation of passing through a colorless void.
Not black. Colorless. Cold burned him. And he was back in
his room.
Its lights were on. He was on his feet but bent over. His
hands were squeezing the neck of Bill Cranam, a security
guard. Bill was on his knees, and he was bent backwards.
His eyes were popping; his face was turning blue; his own
hands were clamped on Jim's wrists.
Someone was screaming at Jim to let loose of Cranam.
209
CHAPTER 25
Two BLOWS OF a billy club on the backs of his elbows
paralyzed Jim's arms. His hands fell away from Cranam's
neck. An arm clamped down on his neck from behind.
Choking, he was dragged from Cranam and thrown down
onto the floor. The other guard, Dick McDonrach, stood
over him, holding his billy club high.

"Don't move, damn you, don't move!" McDonrach said
hoarsely.
Despite this warning, Jim sat up. He was naked. Before
the last two entries, he had removed his clothes. He had had
the idea, probably wrong, that they interfered with the ease
of transition.
"What's going on?" Jim said hoarsely, looking up at
McDonrach. He felt his neck.
"We made a surprise drug sweep," the guard said. "We
found you sitting in that chair; you didn't seem to hear us.
We searched your room. We found this!"
210
RED ORC'S RAGE
He reached into his pocket and brought out a plastic bag
containing some black capsules. Triumphantly, he said,
"Uppers!"
Jim felt dazed and stupid. He said, "They're not mine! I
swear they're not mine!"
At the same time, he saw out of the comer of his eye
faces in the doorway. He turned his head. The doorway was
packed with patients in their pajamas and dressing gowns.
Sandy Melton looked very sad. Gillman Sherwood was
grinning.
Bill Cranam, tenderly feeling his neck, staggered over to
McDonrach's side. His voice was hoarse and squeaky.
"Jesus Christ, Grimson! What got into you? I had a hell
of a time waking you up, and then you attacked me! Why?
Haven't we always been good buddies?"
"I'm sorry. Bill," Jim said. "I was still in ... that
other world. I mean, I wasn't all here. I didn't even know
what I was doing."
"Godamighty!" McDonrach said. "I got blood all over
my shirt!"
Jim had seen the stains, but they had not registered. He
was numb. He would have sworn that he had flushed the
black beauties that Sherwood had given him down the
toilet.
"You got it when you grabbed Jim from behind," Bill
said. He went around Jim and stopped behind him.
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Your back's bleeding like a
stuck pig! How'd you get those deep cuts? We never
touched your back, I'll swear on a pile of Bibles!"
Jim could feel now the agony of the whiplashes and the
wetness and salty sting of the flowing blood.

He said, "I got them ..."
He fell silent. How could he explain? For the moment, he
did not have to do that. What was really important was
211
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
clearing up how the drugs got in his room. That son of a
bitch Sherwood! He had to have something to do with it!
But why would he try to frame anybody? How had he done
it, if he had?
McDonrach, a big, burly, and huge-paunched middle-
aged man, led Jim into the bathroom. He stood Jim before
the mirror with his back to it. Jim, twisting his neck around
as far as he was able, could see his back in the glass. There
were at least six long and deep cuts. These had been
inflicted on Ore by the overseer's whip. Yet they were also
on his back. The blood was starting to cake.
"I'll clean you up," McDonrach said. "But don't make
any sudden moves. I don't trust you."
"I'm not crazy," Jim said. "I was just, well, immersed,
really into it. I didn't know what I was doing. But those
capsules, Mac, they're not mine. Somebody's trying to
frame me."
"That's what they all say."
Mac used a towel to wipe the blood off, then washed the
cuts with soap and water and patted them dry with a paper
towel. After that, he applied rubbing alcohol to the wounds.
Jim clamped his teeth together hard but made no sound.
"You'll have to go to the emergency room for profes-
sional care," McDonrach said. He was grinning as if he
enjoyed hurting Jim. "But I don't think those're going to get
infected. Get your robe and slippers on."
"OK," Jim said. "But I didn't buy those uppers or bring
them here. I'm innocent."
"Nobody your age is innocent."
"A fucking philosopher!" Jim said, snarling.
The red haze that had surrounded Ore was now around
him. He had thought that he could be cool and play it
cautiously and wisely. But McDonrach's last remark trig-
gered the rage that Ore—that he—bore always within
2/2
himself like a low-grade fever. Add to that the injustice of
being accused of using drugs, and the fever boiled up into
a very high grade, indeed.
He did not know what he had done to McDonrach. It may
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (144 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
not have been he, it may have been Ore. Whatever he did
do, it was Ore's fighting skill that he had used. McDonrach
was lying on his back on the green and white tile floor, now
touched with red splotches. He was unconscious, and blood
was flowing from his ear.
Jim screamed, and he lunged out through the bathroom
door. He saw Cranam bringing the billy down against his
skull. After that, blackness.
When he came to his senses, he was on his back on a
table in the emergency room on the first floor of the
hospital. His back pained him, but his head hurt worse.
Doctor Porsena, dressed in a checked woolen shirt and
Levi's, was talking to the intern on duty. Two uniformed
policemen stood just inside the door. A few minutes later,
they were joined by a plainclothes cop. She talked to the
two fuzz, then held a low-voiced conference with Doctor
Porsena.
Jim had rolled onto his side but facing them to watch
them. After a lot of hand waving and head shaking by the
doctor and the cop, the doctor came over to Jim. He said,
"How are you, Jim?"
"'Excelsior!" Jim said. "And I don't mean the stuffing for
couches."
Porsena smiled thinly. "Ever upwards! No need for me to
tell you you're in a hell of a mess. But I think we can work
things out, though that won't be just to make it easy for you.
Roll over. I want to look at your back."
Jim did so. Porsena whistled. "How'd you get those?
They can't be self-inflicted?"
2/3
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"They are . . . in a way. They're Ore's wounds. He got
them from a slave driver he was uppity to."
"You have had stigmata, Jim."
Jim wished that he could see Porsena's face. He said,
"Yeah, but I only had the bleeding. Doctor. Never had the
wounds. My flesh was unbroken. The blood just sort of
oozed out from the skin. Those are real cuts, deep. They
hurt, too. They're not psychologically induced, as you
shrinks say. You're not trying to invalidate me, are you?"
"We'll talk about them later. There's also the matter of
the drugs to investigate. I understand you claim they were
planted. Meanwhile, you'll be kept down here overnight for
observation of a possible concussion. I'll be up and around
for some time trying to find out what happened. Good
night, Jim."
Next afternoon, Jim was back in his room. His cuts were
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (145 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
covered with taped-down gauze, and they pained him far
less than he had expected. Maybe, just maybe, he had
absorbed Ore's ability to heal wounds quickly. It did not
seem likely, but anything was possible.
Jim did some detective work of his own, though he was
restricted to his room except for meals and the therapy
sessions. The Thorazine Doctor Porsena had prescribed for
him made him too complaisant and fuzzy-minded. Despite
this, he had little trouble figuring out what had happened
while he was in the Tiersian worlds. Or, as everybody else
believed, in a trance.
Sherwood's connection was an attendant, Nate Rogers.
The patients knew this, but their "code" forbade them to
inform the staff. Jim had seen Rogers pass drugs to
Sherwood only once, which was enough. What must have
happened the night before was that the drug sweep had
surprised Rogers. Panicked, he had ditched the drugs in
Jim's room. He could have done it easily, right in front of
2/4
RED ORC'S RAGE
the patient. Jim was out of this world—literally. Of course,
it was possible that Sherwood had done it out of spite.
Never mind the speculations. Get to the heart; bite down
on the jugular. Ore wouid do that. Hence, Jim Grirnson
would do that.
It was not yet lunchtime. Jim walked down the hallway,
greeting the few patients. No staff or nurses or attendants
were present to send him back to his room. Nate Rogers, a
tall and well-muscled but ugly man in his late thirties, was
leaning against the door of the linen closet. He was
contemplating a cigarette in his hand as if wondering if he
should light up here or do it in the smoking lounge. When
he became aware that Jim was approaching, he smiled.
"How's the boy, Jim?"
"Not in a good mood, you sneaky son of a bitch!"
Jim grabbed Rogers, spun him around, and pushed him
through the door. Rogers stumbled ahead, trying to keep
from falling. Jim switched on the light. The attendant
caught himself on the far wall and spun around. He was
red-faced, and he looked menacing.
"What the hell is this, shithead?"
Jim told him what it was all about, though Rogers must
have already guessed.
"You'll tell Porsena what you did or I'll beat you into
doing it."
"What? Are you crazy? Yeah, of course, you are! You're
all crazy as bedbugs!"
"Don't forget that," Jim said. "We'll cut your throat if
you turn your back on us. I will, anyway. You coming with
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (146 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

me to Porsena's office?"
"Shit!" Rogers said. "You got nothing, absolutely noth-
ing, on me! Get lost, punk, or I'll wipe the floor with you!"
"Your cliches could do that."
"What? What's that?"
215
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"Listen," Jim said. "You won't believe me, maybe, but
I know how to kill you in two seconds with my bare hands."
"Bullshit!" Rogers said, and he sneered. "Even if you
could, you wouldn't! You wanna go to prison for life?"
"I've seen you give Sherwood drugs," Jim said. "So've
a lot of other kids. If they think I've been framed, they'll
forget about this stupid code of silence. They'll stand up for
me."
"Sure they will! In a pig's ass! You think they want their
supply cut off?"                                          ;
"There's only a few buying illegal drugs from Sher- |
wood," Jim said. "They'll be outnumbered. OK. What |
about it? You got five seconds. One, two, three, four, five!"  j
Rogers, swinging his fists, ran straight at Jim. A second
later, he was flat on his back, his eyes glazed and his mouth
open. Jim waited until Rogers had recovered his wits.
"I just clipped you on the chin," Jim said. "That didn't
do my hand any good. Next time, I kick you in the belly or
ram three fingers just under your heart and squeeze it until
stops. I don't like to do this, Rogers. No, that's wrong. I'm
really enjoying this."
He was lying. It had suddenly occurred to him that he
should be doing something tricky but nonviolent to get
Rogers to confess. Wasn't that what Ore would do? Maybe
he had, after all, done the wrong thing. He might be making
this mess worse.
Too late now. His course was set. No turning back.
"So you can do all that?" Rogers said. "I'm just staying
here on the floor until you leave. I might start yelling, too.
You think you're in trouble now? Wait and see what deep
shit you'll be in!"
The door swung open, its edge barely missing Jim. He
stepped to one side and saw that Sherwood was standing
216
RED ORC'S RAGE
there, the door swinging shut behind him. The big blond
youth was blinking with surprise and alarm.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (147 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Jim stepped in behind him with his back to the door, now
closed. He said, "Going to make a deal here, Sherwood? I
got one for you!"
Rogers had to have in his pockets the drugs that Sher-
wood was going to buy. Without thinking about what he
intended to do, Jim shoved the youth forward. Immediately,
he opened the door, stepped into the hallway, slammed the
door shut, and leaned hard against it. Sandy Melton was
coming down the hall. He called to her to bring the security
guards.
"Tell them I caught Sherwood and Rogers in a drug
deal!"
Sandy was confused.
"What? You're turning them in? But . . . !"
"It's my ass or theirs," he said. "Get going!"
She came back a minute later, followed by two day
guards, Elissa Radowski and Bee Vamas. Jim had to strain
against the door to keep Sherwood from ramming it open.
He said, "Quick! Rogers and Sherwood were dealing in
there! I caught them! You better get in fast before Rogers
ditches the stuff!"
He stepped back, unlocking and swinging the door open.
Sherwood fell through it onto his hands and knees. The
guards charged into the room. Jim saw Rogers with a plastic
bag in his hand. Evidently, he had just swallowed its
contents. Only a person in a mindless panic would do that.
And it did him no good. The guards pulled six other bags
from the inner pocket of his white attendant's jacket. Then
he was taken to emergency, where his stomach was pumped
before the downers killed him.
Sherwood made a bad mistake while the guards were
taking Rogers away. He came up off the floor and grabbed
2/7
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim's testicles. Before he could squeeze them, he was
knocked backward by the heel of a palm slammed against
his forehead. His neck and back bent backward; he
screamed with pain. Some minutes later, strapped down on
a gumey, he followed Rogers to the emergency room.
Jim stood against the wall, shaking his head and blowing
out air. Again, the red cloud had settled over his mind, and
he would have kicked Sherwood in the ribs if Sandy Melton
had not clung to him while she screamed at him to be cool,
for God's sake.
Doctors Porsena, Tarchuna, and Scaevola came then,
pushing through the crowd of patients and attendants. It
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (148 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
took some time for them to quiet down and disperse all but
Sandy and Jim and more time to get their story.
After the questioning, Porsena ordered that Jim be locked
in his room. "Mainly to keep you out of trouble and to allow
you to settle down," he said. "I'll be seeing you when this
mess is cleared up. I don't want you making still another."
The usually unflappable psychiatrist was angry. His set
face and his tone of voice made that obvious. Jim went
unprotesting to his room. That even Doctor Porsena was
upset with him impressed him very deeply. But Porsena did
not, as Jim had expected, summon him to his office later
that day. He did give Jim another Thorazine after ascertain-
ing when he had taken the previous one.
The tranquilizer did not soothe Jim. He became furious,
then agonized with repentance, then furious again. Instead
of going to bed after lights-out, he paced back and forth in
his room, freezing with misery, burning with rage.
218
CHAPTER 26
JIM WAS IN the psychiatrist's office for his private session-
A new framed paper with big fancy printed letters was
hanging on the wall. Jim could not read it from his position,
but he supposed that it was a recent honor. The doctor had
more diplomas and citations than a Hollywood magnate had
yes-men.
A new bust was on the top shelf in a comer. Below it
were the white, stony-eyed, and bushy-bearded busts of
some ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and statues of
a sitting Buddha and St. Francis of Assisi. Curious about
the addition, Jim got out of his chair to look at it while
Porsena was still scribbling on a paper.
The face, except for the mustache, closely resembled
Julius Caesar's bust. It was Doctor Porsena's. Below it was
inscribed: TO THE UNKNOWN PSYCHIATRIST.
Though Jim was in no mood to laugh, he broke up. The
doctor had a hell of a sense of humor, though it was usually
rather restrained and quiet.

PHILIP JOSE FARMER                                                  RED ORC'S RAGE
At the beginning of the session, Porsena had outlined the
"mess" Jim was still in. His words were very rapid but
clearly articulated and lacking pauses, almost as fast as an
auctioneer's. He always spoke thus when he was dealing
with a subject that had to be disposed of before the real
business, therapy, was gotten to.
Rogers had been allowed to quit his position without
being charged with drug dealing. To get that, he had had to
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (149 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
make a full confession and to drop the charges of assault
and battery he had threatened to make against Jim. Gillman
Sherwood had also not charged Jim with assault and battery
and intent to kill. The doctor had made it clear that, if he
did, he would be accused of dealing, too. Moreover, he
would be kicked out of the project.
Sherwood was back in his room but under strict proba-
tion. He walked with a stiff back, his neck hurt when he
turned it, and he kept out of Jim's way.
Cranam and McDonrach had also not pressed charges
against Jim. They were in trouble because Doctor Porsena
claimed that they had mishandled the situation with Jim.
Though they could continue to work as security guards,
they would not be attached to the mental ward.
"I believe firmly in giving a person a second chance," the
doctor had said. "In this case, you're getting one, too.
You're as much on probation as the others. Now, I spoke of
your unusually vivid imagination. It has helped you
progress faster in your therapy than your fellow patients. I
don't want you to get a swelled head just because of that.
You were just lucky to have been bom with it."
The doctor paused. His blue eyes invoked images of the
Vikings of whom Jim's grandfather had told him. The eyes
were those of Leif the Lucky, staring across the sullen and
dangerous sea which seemed to go on forever. Somewhere,
beyond some distant horizon, was undiscovered land. Was
it too far away? Should he turn back to Greenland?
Doctor Porsena's expression changed subtly. He had
made up his mind. He said, "It's time to begin shedding
Red Ore's undesirable characteristics."
Jim said nothing. He sat in the chair as rigidly, except for
the blinking of his eyelids, as if Porsena had dipped him in
a cryogenic cylinder.
Finally, the doctor said, "How do you feel about this?"
Jim shifted his buttocks, looked at the ceiling for a
moment, and then licked his lips.
"I ... I'll admit I'm scared. I feel ... I feel as if
I've had a . . . a great loss. I don't know ..."
"You know," Porsena said.
"Is it really necessary? Aren't you rushing things? I've
just gotten into Ore. Jesus, how many days has it been since
it started? Not many!"
"The number of days in therapy is not significant. We're
not a penal institution. What counts is the rate of progress in
your therapy. And you need not be ashamed because you're
frightened. At this stage, every patient is panicked. I'd be
very suspicious if your reaction was casual. I'd wonder if
you were genuinely and deeply in Ore's persona. But I've
not the slightest doubt that you are."

"Too deeply?" Jim said.
"That remains to be seen."
"What are his bad features?" Jim said loudly.
"You tell me."
"I'd rather go over his good features first."
"Whatever order you desire. Before you do that, what are
your feelings, emotional and physical, just now? Besides
being scared."
"I feel better when I'm talking about what's good about
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
Ore. My heart is still hammering hard, though. And my
bowels, they feel kind of greasy. I have to urinate, too."
"Can you hold it? Or would you be too uncomfortable?"
"I don't know," Jim said. "I guess so. It isn't as bad as
I thought a moment ago."
"Ore's desirable characteristics? Those you felt you
lacked or were too weak?"
"Listen!" Jim burst out. "I can't quit going into him! He
needs me! There's the ghostbrain! I got to get him rid of
that! If it takes over, he won't be Ore anymore! Not really!
I wouldn't want to enter that body if its mind was no longer
Ore's! I'd hate that! Besides, what would be the point?"
He paused to swallow. His lips and mouth were very dry.
"Besides, you aren't going to let me enter again!"
"I didn't say that," the doctor said. "That's something
you assumed, and I want you to look into that assumption.
When you know why, tell me why you think I'll make you
abandon Ore. That's what you think, isn't it? That you'll
have to give up Ore? But I haven't said you'll have to do
that. I don't want you to enter him for some time, which
time will be determined by your progress. Later, you will
continue the entries. Now, what are his good traits?"
"Ah . . . undaunted courage. Determination that won't
stop. Ingenuity, using the materials at hand to attain his
goal. A burning desire to leam all sorts of things. Curiosity.
A great self-esteem. Boy, do I wish I had it! Ability to adapt
to any situation, to get along with people, high or low, if it's
to his advantage. Patience of a turtle. But he's rabbit-fast
when he has to be."
"Anything else?"
"Well, there's his relations with his family. Not all good,
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (151 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

but he really loves his mother, though he gets mad at her
because she doesn't stand up strongly enough or often
enough to his father. Still, she is strong. Also, Ore is crazy
222
about his Aunt Vala. As for his relations with the natives,
especially his half sisters, he's never been cruel to them. I
suppose you could say his seducing them, knocking them
up, was not exactly Christian behavior. But he never forced
them, and the natives think bearing a Lord's child is a great
honor. It sure makes life in general better for them."
"What is your estimate of your success in absorbing, as
it were. Ore's good characteristics? Have you been able to
raise your own self-esteem, for instance?"
"You're the one's supposed to judge things like that!"
"I'm asking you."
"Well, I think I've got a lot more sense of my own worth,
which is good. I mean ... my self-esteem is much bigger
than it was. Better. Only ..."
"Only what?"
"Is that self-esteem mine? Or is it borrowed from Ore?
Am I still playing Ore when I'm on Earth, and is it going to
stick?"
"A person with genuine self-esteem does not care what
people think of him," the doctor said. "He or she is his own
judge of self-worth. I'd say that a true indicator of your
genuine self-esteem is your behavior when you're presented
with a problem. You seem to take matters in your own
hands now. You don't mope around. You don't just wish
you could do something about a situation but don't do it. Is
my observation correct?"
Jim nodded, and he said, "Seems to be on the mark. I'm
not as cowardly as I used to be. I don't think so, anyway."
"Perhaps you were never as cowardly as you thought you
were? You fought the bully, Freehoffer, when you could
have walked away from him."
"Sure!" Jim said. "And have everybody thinking I had a
yellow streak a mile wide down my back?"
"If that happened now, would you fight because you were
223
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
more afraid of social condemnation than of physical vio-
lence or because you just were not afraid of him? And you
thought that to continue to give in to his bullying was
wrong?"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (152 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

"The latter, I suppose. How would I know unless it
happened again?"
"It did happen again, in a sense. You did not have to be
pushed into a comer until you got so desperate you tackled
Sherwood and Rogers. As soon as you knew what the
situation was, you charged on in and solved it. You could
have done it differently and better. The point is that you did
it at once.
"Now let's discuss Ore's undesirable characteristics."
"That's easy. He's arrogant. But he can't help that. He's
been raised as a Lord. They think they're God's chosen
people, even though they don't believe in God. In fact,
they're the only people, so they think. Other humans aren't
real people."
"You're excusing him. Do you think that arrogance is an
undesirable characteristic? For you?"
"Yeah, sure. I don't want to be a big prick."
"Is Ore, as you say, a big prick? In the sense you mean,
that is?"
"Yeah."
"What else?"
"Well, there's his cruelty. That seems to go along with
being a Lord. But in the beginning, when I was first in him,
he did have some compassion. He got into trouble with his
father because he refused to kill his half-brother, even if he
was a leblabbiy. I don't think he's got any compassion or

"Then there's his continual rage. Most of the time,
anyway. He's always mad. But it's because of the way his

father treated him and his mother's failure to stop his father
from gating him out to Anthema. Why did they do that to
their son? He was just not going to bow and scrape to his
father and kiss his ass all the time and put up with Los's
uncalled-for blows and kicks and insults, that's all. Of
course he was in a rage. You can't blame him for that. I'd
be madder than hell, too. So, is that bad?"
"We've discussed appropriate anger and inappropriate
anger," Doctor Porsena said. "You told me that Ore was
considering using the destruction engine in Zazel's world to
destroy his own world. That would not only kill his father.
His mother, brothers, and sisters and several million natives
and, in fact, all living creatures in that world would die. Is
that appropriate revenge?"
"It was just a fantasy!" Jim said. "Hell, everybody has
fantasies like that! But they don't act them out! Besides, he
was going to rescue his mother and brother first!"

"And let everybody else die. As for these common
fantasies of revenge, those who have them usually don't act
them out. But Ore does. That is, he will if he goes back to
get the destruction engine. If he does get it, will he use it?"
"I hope not. That'd be horrible. But I won't know if he
will do that unless I reenter, will I?"
"You probably do know now," the doctor said. "But you
won't admit that you do. However, what would Ore have
done if he had been framed as you were?"
"The same thing," Jim said proudly. "I did what I
thought he'd do."
"Would he have assaulted the two guards? Not if he was
thinking as coolly as you say he does in most situations. I
admit you were provoked. Not enough, in my judgment, to
react so violently. And do you think it was necessary to
assault Sherwood and Rogers? Couldn't there have been
another way to expose them?"
225
PHILIP JOSE FARMER                                                 RED ORC'S RAGE
"Yeah, sure. If I snitched on them. But 1 couldn't prove
anything just by telling the guards or you. I had to catch
them in the act. There was no other way. Anyway, I'd never
snitch!"
"You had exposed them. But you hurt Sherwood."
"He attacked me!"
"Your defense was more like offense. A very violent
offense."
"That's what Ore would have done!"
"Exactly. Was it appropriate for you?"
Jim frowned and bit his lower lip. Then he said, "You're
telling me that acting like Ore then was wrong behavior for
my situation."
"I didn't tell you that. You told me. And . . . ?"
"OK. I see now. I hadn't sorted out what was appropriate
in Ore's behavior and what was inappropriate."
"And for you."
The psychiatrist pursued the subject. Jim realized that
Doctor Porsena was being a guide who let his client make
his own map as they traveled. But he could not anticipate
the direction in which the guide was taking him.
At the end of the session, the doctor told Jim to get, each
day, the prescribed amount of Thorazine from the phar-
macy.
"You'll be on it for a while. Not very long, perhaps.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (154 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

Meanwhile, you are not to reenter. I'll tell you when you
can do that. I want you to have time to evaluate your
experiences and your feelings about them. Then we'll talk
about reentry. I stress strongly, and I know what I'm doing,
that you do not use your tragil until I say you can. No
launch until the mental weather is good, right?"
"OK. I hear you loud and clear."
When Jim stepped out into the hallway, he was suddenly
226
in a bright light. He could not tell Doctor Porsena what the
light had revealed to him. He would be very alarmed and
would take measures that Jim would not like. Maybe,
though, the doctor already suspected the truth.
Jim was addicted to being Ore.
227
CHAPTER 27
i HERE WERE SEVERAL items that neither the doctor nor Jim
had mentioned. One was that Jim did not have to worry
about Ore having been beheaded by the slavedriver. After
all, had not Farmer written that the young Lord, now known
as Red Ore, was alive in the middle twentieth century
A.D.? Thus, Jim's worry that Ore might be killed was
unfounded. Knowing this, why was he so concerned?
Another item was the discrepancy between Farmer's
account of the Lords and Jim's direct knowledge of them. In
the World of Tiers series, Vala was sister to Rintrah and
Jadawin. In the real worlds of the Lords, Vala was sister to
Enitharmon, Ore's mother. Rintrah was the second child of
Los and Enitharmon and was Ore's younger brother.
After some thought about this, Jim had concluded that
Farmer's knowledge was fragmentary or received through a
filter which let some but not all information through.
Doctor Porsena and his staff believed, though they had
225
RED ORC'S RAGE
.never said so to the patients, that the World of Tiers series
was pure fiction. Jim knew better. Farmer was said to have
had some genuine mystic experiences, and he must have
been or maybe still was a receiver of a sort. Somehow,
impressions of the Lords' worlds had been transmitted to
him. Their light had come to him through a glass darkly by
interuniversal psychic vibrations or other means. But he did
not always have their exact frequencies, and "static"
interfered with his reception. Thus, he could be expected to
receive not quite accurate messages. Also, since he was
writing what most people thought was fiction, he could
make up stuff to fill in the cracks, as it were.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (155 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Nevertheless, despite some errors in chronology and
identification. Farmer's WOT arrows were usually in or
near the bull's eye. Also, some Lords whom Jim knew or
knew about were not necessarily those of whom Farmer
wrote. They could be descendants of the originals or their
relatives. How many Robert Smiths and John Browns living
in the fifteenth century had numerous descendants in the
twentieth century? Los, Tharmas, Ore, Vala, Luvah, and
other names could be, though not common, not rare.
Jim had more urgent problems than these. Since he was on
probation, he had to control his "antisocial" behavior. That
became increasingly difficult because of his mounting grouch-
iness and quick-to-ignite temper. He was hooked on Ore, and,
since he could not enter him, he was suffering withdrawal
symptoms. If his brain could have teeth, they would ache. If
it had a nose, it would drip and sniffle. If it had a voice, it
would be pleading, between screams, for a fix.
However, he was able to temper his temper somewhat with
a technique Ore used. It seemed to Jim to be similar to some
Yogic mental techniques he had read about. But it could be
learned much more quickly. After all, the Lords had had many
thousands of years to perfect it. Though it was not able to
229
PHILIP JOSE FARMER                                                  RED ORC'S RAGE
dissipate the withdrawal effects, it did dilute the pain and
irritability. The technique was like lifting now and then the
cover on a boiling pot to let out some steam. Meanwhile, Jim
managed to keep from snarling at and insulting people.
He did feel a little better when Mrs. Wyzak phoned to
reaffirm her invitation for him to live at her house while he
was an outpatient. At Sam's funeral, Mrs. Wyzak, sobbing,
had enfolded Jim in her arms and promised him that he
would have a place he could call home. Despite her grief,
she had also told him that he would have to obey her rules.
No drugs, no smoking in the house, no foul or blasphemous
language, strict attention to his schoolwork, daily bathing,
punctuality at mealtimes, no loud music, and so on.
Jim had promised that he would do as she wanted. He did
not think that he would have much trouble. He had
progressed greatly in outward behavior—except for the
present withdrawal symptoms—and he could keep his
"antisocial" thoughts to himself while around her.
His elation about Mrs. Wyzak's offer was quenched the
next day. His mother phoned that she was visiting him that
evening. He expected her to tell him exactly what she did
tell him. His parents were leaving for Texas in five days.
He felt tears rising; his heart seemed to fall in on itself.
Though he had toughened himself for this moment, or
thought he had, he was badly hurt. But he succeeded in
closing the valves on the tears. He was not going to let her
see him cry. He did not want her to tell his father that he was
so deeply affected. Eric Grimson would rejoice at the
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (156 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
thought that his son was a sissy.
Jim did not ask why his father was not there to face him.
He knew why. The coward!
Eva Grimson, sobbing, left him. She promised that she
would send money for his hospital insurance. Also, she was
sure that she could send money for clothing, schoolbooks,
230
and other necessities. His father would find a good job, but
Jim would have to be patient.
"I'll be patient forever," he called to her as she stumbled
to the elevator. "It'll be forever before I come to Texas!
Maybe I'll come before then if my father dies!"
That was cruel. Not cruel enough for him in his present
mood.
A few minutes later, as he walked down the hallway
toward his room, he was stopped by Sandy Melton. She was
very happy though not superexcited. Her manic phases had
been toned down by her therapy. Besides, this time, there
was a reason for her happiness. She had gotten a letter from
her father which she wanted to read to Jim.
Ordinarily, he would have been glad to share her joy. It
angered him just now to see someone else happy.
Nevertheless, he mastered his impatience.
"Daddy's going to get a job here at his headquarters
company! Listen! 'Dear Sandy, my favorite daughter.' He's
only got one child, me, you know. 'As I've told you far too
many times, I'm tired of traveling-salesman jokes, and I'm fed
up with being one.' He means with being a salesman, not a
joke. 'I wouldn't mind so much if I was a great traveling
salesman. But I just can't hope to ever be in the same class
with St. Paul of Tarsus, who's maybe the greatest of all,
Genghis Khan, who sold death to millions of slaughtered
people, the man who sold refrigerators to Eskimos, and Willie
What's His Name, Arthur Miller's salesman, great only in his
struggle against failure. Anyway, I've been offered the posi-
tion of sales supervisor at my favorite cold heartless corpora-
tion, Acme Textiles. Do you think I'm going to turn it down
for any ethical, moral, philosophical, or monetary reasons?
Think again! So, my darling daughter, I'll be crossing the
Rubicon, burning my bridges behind me, and storming the
breach once again, the latter being, namely, your mother, poor

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
her on separate maintenance or a divorce, whatever God and
her evil temper decide.'"
Sandy jumped up and down, the letter fluttering in her
hand like a flag of victory.
"Isn't he great? Isn't he marvelous? I know what he has
in mind. Divorce! He must've got over his guilt about her,
wish I could but I will, and he's going to be home nights,
and I'll be there!"
Jim hugged Sandy, then said, "I just have to go."
"But I want to celebrate!"
"Damn it. Sandy! I don't want to hurt your feelings, but
I can't stand it! I'm sorry. I'll see you later!"
He strode away. His tears were going to stream before he
got to his room. Sandy called after him, "If there's anything
I can do to help, Jim?"
Her sympathy and care touched the lachrymic button. He
began to weep and sob. He ran to his room, slammed the door
shut behind him, and sat down to let his grief flow. He would
have liked to throw himself on the bed and press his face into
the cover. He did not do that because that was what a woman
would do.
In the midst of the outpouring of tears, that thought came
to him. And that set up a domino effect somewhere in his
brain. The last thought to be bumped out—the others
toppled in the dark—was the advice his grandfather, Ragnar
Grimsson, had once given him.
"It's a peculiarity of the Norwegian culture and of the
English and American, too, that men are not supposed to cry.
Stiff upper lip and all that. But the Vikings, your ancestors,
Jim, cried like women in public or privately. They soaked their
beards with tears and were not one bit ashamed about it. Yet,
they were as quick to draw their swords as they were to shed
232
tears. So, what's all this crap about men having to bold in their
sorrow and grief and disappointment? They get ulcers and
heart damage and strokes because of the stiff upper lip, don't
you know, old bean, old chum, old chap?"
Ore, like most Thoan males, was a stoic in certain situations
and a weeper and groaner in others. If he was in physical pain,
he did not show it. But when joyous or grief-stricken, he could
howl, weep, and carry on as much as he wished.
The latter behavior seemed to Jim to be a desirable character
element. However, in this Earthly time and place, he would be
regarded as a weak sister if he incorporated that part of Ore's
persona. Whatever strength of character he had absorbed from
the young Lord, he was not strong enough—as yet, any-
way—to ignore others' opinion about this trait.
By the time for group session, he had gotten over much of
his grief and anger. At least he felt as if he had, but he knew
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (158 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
that strong emotions were sneaky things. They hid, and then
they popped out when something opened the gate for them. At
the moment, he was thinking that, if his parents had deserted
him, they had done so under duress. They should get away
from here so that they could climb out of the poverty pit. It was
really not their fault that he was unable to come with them.
Well, it was partly their fault. But what else could they do?
And he was strong enough to take care of himself—after the
therapy was complete.
It would be hard to tackle his studies now and hope to
graduate from high school with at least a B-minus or C-plus
average. Going to college and supporting himself while
striving to get good grades would be even more difficult.
But he could do it. Others less equipped with will and
intelligence had done it.
That thought surprised him. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! What
had happened to him? Not so long ago, he had believed that he
was too dumb to earn, really earn, graduation from high
233
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
school. Suddenly, he was going to go to college and do well at
it. He was even eager to plunge into his studies.
Strange sea-change, he thought. Metamorphosis. The
cockroach had turned, seemingly overnight, into a human
being. Maybe not a high-class human but a better class than
he had been. He owed that change to Ore. No. Ultimately,
he owed it to Doctor Porsena, The Shaman, The Sphinx.
But the psychiatrist would tell him that Jim Grimson owed
the change to himself. Though he had gotten help, he had
done what no one could do for himself.
Feeling high, he went to the session to tell the thirteen
other members just how good he felt and why he was on the
Yellow Brick Road and the rainbow was just around its
bend. Today, though, most of the Tiersian Musketeers, as
they called themselves, were also in a mild manic phase.
Mild was a relative word. Compared to their gloomy and
hopeless mood when entering therapy, mild was wild.
They were so eager to talk that Doctor Scaevola, the
group leader, had a hard time keeping order. Part of his
difficulty sprang from their attitude toward him. Though he
was enthusiastic about Tiersian therapy as an "as-if" or
fantasy-using technique, he obviously did not believe that
their trips were real. His tone of voice and facial and body
language betrayed his incredulity.
According to one patient, Monique Bragg, who had been
filling in as an office clerk now and then, she had overheard
Porsena and Scaevola arguing about the concept of parallel
worlds. Porsena had not said that there were such things.
But he had maintained that recent speculation in theoretical
physics indicated that parallel worlds were possible. Scae-
vola had been outright scornful of this.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (159 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:33 PM]

Scaevola also had some trouble relating to juveniles, or
anyone else, addicted to rock music. He liked only Italian
opera and classical composers.
234
RED ORC'S RAGE
Scaevola finally quieted the group down. Brooks Ep-
stein, eighteen years old, spoke first. He was tall and rangy
and had a Lincolnesque face. His voice embarrassed him
because it was so thin and shrill. It was not fitting for a
lawyer or surgeon. Despite this, his parents wanted him to
be one or the other. Brooks admitted that these professions
were reasonable and desirable—if you cared for them. But
he passionately desired to be a baseball player. He had told
his parents that he would go to college and then Harvard if
he failed to become a major league player. That had not
satisfied them. But he had held out against them and also
against his fiancee, who was wholly on their side.
While the argument was raging and Brooks was becoming
more despondent but increasingly stubborn, his father had
killed himself. Though the cause seemed to be the failure of
his hardware store chain and an inevitably fatal case of
myeloma cancer. Brooks was devastated with guilt. His
abandonment of the Jewish faith had enraged and hurt his
parents and deeply shaken his fiancee. His mother had never
said openly that his father's worry about this had brought on
his bankruptcy and cancer, but it was evident that she believed it.
Attending Harvard had then become an impossibility.
Brooks was happy about this, though at the same time he
felt guiltier. Then a rich uncle in Chicago had offered to
finance his studies in whatever university Brooks selected.
The catch was that he return to his faith and get either a
legal or medical degree. His mother and fiancee had pressed
him hard to accept the offer. They were as relentless as
hungry v/olves circling an elk floundering in deep snow.
One night. Brooks went ape, as he put it. Using his
baseball bats, he had broken furniture, expensive art ob-
jects, and windows. Worse, he had threatened to bash in the
skulls of his mother and fiancee. The police had hauled him
away. After failure with Freudian, Jungian, and Sullivanian
235
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
therapists and a stint at Est in California, he had ended up
in the care of Doctor Porsena.
The persona he had chosen was that of the Yidshe knight,
Baron funem Laksfalk. The baron was a character in the first
book of the series. He lived in the Dracheland der of the
tower-of-Babel-shaped planet ruled by Lord Jadawin. Though
this was inhabited by creatures Jadawin had made, it was also
populated by the descendants of people from Earth. Jadawin,
as conscienceless as any Thoan, had abducted some groups of
medieval Germans and German Jews and gated them to his
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (160 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
world. These had twoseparate feudal societies which Jadawin
had encouraged to resemble those found in the Arthurian tales.
In the first book of the series, the wandering knight, funem
Laksfalk, had fallen in with Kickaha and Wolff after a joust.
He had died fighting bravely by Wolff's side against a band of
savages. But Brooks chose to enact his adventures during the
years before funem Laksfalk's last stand.
Brooks Epstein reported that, as of today, his heavy
burden of guilt and anger seemed to be lighter. This was
because he knew that the baron, should his father die,
would not suffer guilt if he was not responsible for it. He,
Brooks, had not caused his father's bankruptcy, cancer, or
suicide. Therefore, he should not suffer from guilt. Despite
his rationalizing, he was still suffering. But he felt that he
would get over that.
As for his profession, he still intended to become a
baseball pitcher. It was not a criminal line of work, which
was more than you could say for that engaged in by many
lawyers and doctors.
After Brooks had narrated the previous night's adventure,
the group talked about how they felt about the Yidshe baron
and how they would have altered his situation. Jim was
aware that Doctor Porsena and his assistants were interpret-
ing the remarks as they applied generally to the group. He
236
RED ORC'S RAGE
guessed that, later in therapy, they would interpret these as
they applied to the individuals uttering them.
It seemed to him that the World of Tiers was being used
as a sort of communion. The patients had very personal—
idiosyncratic?—and uncontrollable delusions, unrealistic
desires, and hallucinations of various degrees. But all now
shared in this communion, the Tiers series. They were
heading toward each other, converging, drawn together like
flies scenting honey. And they were unconsciously modi-
fying their views of the Lords' worlds, shaping them into a
dimly seen common world. Its shape would be realized
when they were well advanced in therapy. They would
know then that they had torn apart their own little boats and
put the pieces together as a large ship.
Maybe he was just allowing his imagination, not to mention
his metaphors, to run away with him. In any event, he sensed
that the therapy was working well for most of them. However,
the world he entered. Ore's world, was not fantasy. It was as
real as this one. More real, in some respects.
The next to speak was fourteen-year-old Ben Ligel. He had
had some hallucinations when he was on drugs and just as
many as when off. The primal loner, his main problem was his
close-to-panic unease in unfamiliar situations or when with
anybody but a few close friends. Now, he was not, most of the
rime, unbearably uncomfortable when with his fellows. But
when the times came that he could not stand being too close to
others, he escaped to the other worlds.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (161 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

To do this, he put a Tiers book on his head and used it as
a "gravity gate." Headfirst, he was pressed down into the
pocket universe he had chosen. Simultaneously, gravity
pulled the book downward on that part of his body still on
Earth. When the cover of the book reached the floor, he
would find himself in the other world.
Ben stayed there until the "latent tug of gravity" pulled him
237
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
back to Earth. He was always refreshed by the voyage, and he
was able to endure the "social pressures" for some time.
Third to speak was seventeen-year-old Kathy Maidanoff.
She was not backward in telling the group that she had been
diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder, gender
confusion, and nymphomania. Though she had, so far, been
chaste while in the hospital, she did get sexual relief through
erotic dreams. She would put a Tiers book close to her head
and another on her crotch. Then, almost always, she would
dream of sex with a male or female character. She had just
entered a phase of therapy in which she was being taught how
to control her dreams. Jim was astute enough to guess that the
staff was not doing this just to enable her to enjoy the dreams
better. The process had something to do with getting her to
control her delusions. Then, these would gradually be stripped
from her through other techniques.
Jim had not mentioned that he was master of the controlled
dream technique. He did not, however, require book aids.
While in Ore, he had learned through him how to prefabricate
dreams. Now, when Jim slept, he used these controlled wet
dreams to relieve himself. They were much more satisfactory
than masturbation. "Look, Ma, no hands!" Their danger was
that the dreamer could become addicted to them. In time, he or
she would regard flesh-and-blood lovers as cumbersome,
time-wasting, and unnecessary.
Jim had noted that Ore's partners in the dreams were
usually his aunt, Vala, and his mother, Enitharmon.
Quite often, Jim also put the women, lovelier than Helen
of Troy or Vivien Leigh, in his programmed night visions,
sometimes at the same time. That it was incest, though
secondhand, was the dressing on the salad.
Early that night, Jim made a decision that he knew might
ruin everything for him. He could not help it. His own
arguments against the idea did not help him resist it. He
238
RED ORC'S RAGE
would be disobeying Porsena's orders. He did not want to
do that. Yet, he would.
At ten minutes to eight, he passed through the black hole
in the center of the tragil. Despite Porsena's forbidding it,
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (162 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
he planned to enter Ore. Not just once but many times
during this night. And, since he dare not journey every
night—too much danger of being caught—he would com-
press the many into a single night.
From ten minutes to eight in the evening to six in the
morning would give him time to hurl himself over spans of
many years.
What had he read when in Mr. Lum's class? It was from
the poet, William Blake.
"Hold infinity in the palm of your hand/And eternity in
an hour."
He would not go so far as to say that he would time-hop,
via Ore, through eternity in one night. But he would try to
squeeze into ten hours as many slices of eternity as he
could.
Just before he started chanting, he saw Porsena's face. It
was disapproving and sad. The chanting faltered and almost
faded away into silence. But Jim felt a stronger pull. Ore
and the exotic worlds behind the walls of Earth punched
through the black hole and shattered Porsena's face. Its
fragments flew away and Jim flew through the fragments
into the tragil like a World War II bomber through flak.
Suddenly, he was in intense pain. He screamed voice-
lessly. Ore, however, was grinding his teeth together and
was not even moaning softly. He would not give his father
any satisfaction from hearing him cry out.
Ore was stretched out against a cross. His feet rested on
the ground, but his hands were nailed to the horizontal
arms. He did not think he could endure the agony for
another second. Yet, he did.

CHAPTER 28
NOT so JIM. He had suffered enough with and through
Ore. Enough was enough and more than enough. Despite
this, he managed to hang on for a minute. Ore was high on
the side of a mountain. Far far below, at the foot of the
mountain, was a broad lake fed by a river. On the lakefront
was Golgonooza, the new palace of Los, the City of Art. A
river ran on its far side. The buildings were of varicolored
metal, soft looking and all rising from the ground at a gentle
angle and then becoming steeper, but never entirely verti-
cal, until they got to perhaps a thousand feet. After that,
they went straight up for many hundreds of feet, then leaned
outward. They seemed to melt into each other at various
levels. Green, scarlet, orange, and lemon-colored vegeta-
tion grew on many of these. Much of this consisted of trees,
some of which grew at right angles to the vertical surfaces
of the buildings.
Los had been working on the city-palace, on and off, for

several centuries. He planned it to be the most magnificent
of Thoan structures, greater than Urizen's Insubstantial
Palace.
Los had caught Ore just after he had entered a gate into
this world. Yesterday, he had crucified his son despite
Enitharmon's desperate pleas. Los was about to drive in the
second nail himself when he was attacked by her. Before
she had been knocked out, she had clawed his face bloody.
Now, Ore's mother was imprisoned somewhere in Golgo-
nooza.
Unable to withstand the pain any longer, Jim changed the
mantra, and he was back in his room. The time was still ten
minutes to eight. The minor hand had moved an almost
imperceptible degree. Shaking from the ordeal, he got a
drink of water in the bathroom and rested in the chair for a
while. Then, sharply aware that he was losing time and he
had many trips to go, he began droning, "ATA MATUMA
M'MATA!" This time, the chant did not have to go on so
long. Seven repetitions hurled him through the black hole.
The next time, he was sure, it would only take five. The trip
after that would need only three. The remaining trips would
continue to take three. He did not know why. It just was that
way.
His time target was a year later. He landed in Ore in a
situation which would once have embarrassed him. But he
had been in the young Lord in too many similar circum-
stances to be taken aback. Ore was making violent love to
his aunt Vala. That, apparently, was how she desired it. A
gentle lover was not for her. Jim was caught up in the raging
maelstrom of lust and had no time or inclination to think
about the surroundings. Not until both were spent was Jim
able to do anything on his own. Though also suffering the
effects of the "little death," as some called postcoital
241
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
lassitude, he was lively enough to note the immediate
environment.
The two Lords were in a magnificently furnished bed-
room as large as a mansion. The walls and the pillars
crawled with changing colors. The windows were twice the
size of a football field. They, too, bore shifting colors, tints,
and hues. Now and then, they became transparent. Then,
Jim could see a black sky with many stars. Later, the top of
a planet came into view. As Jim discovered after a while
from Ore's and Vala's conversation, they were in a satellite
with a figure-eight orbit.
They had fled through various universes after Vala had
rescued Ore from the cross. They did not go to the world of
Luvah, Vala's husband, because Luvah and Vala had split i
up. Unlike most Lords, Luvah had not killed his spouse but |

had allowed her to try her luck at dispossessing another |
Lord of another world.                                  .
Los, like a hound of heaven, had dogged his son and i
sister-in-law as they passed through gate after gate. Then
they had been separated—they did not say why—and Ore '•
had gone on. But they had found each other after many
adventures. This world was—had been—Ellayol's. After
getting through several gates set with many traps. Ore and
Vala had killed Ellayol, his wife, and his children.
This news deeply disturbed Jim. The Lords were so
murderous, and Ore seemed to have lost whatever humane
feelings he had once had.
Vala and Ore had gated to this satellite to enjoy a lovers'
vacation. Shortly after learning this, Jim was on fire with
the same flames burning in the two. There was another rest,
and then they were at it again. This went on and on with not
much talk between the bouts nor many thoughts about the
past. When they started to gash each other with their
fingernails and to lick each other's blood, Jim loosed
242
RED ORC'S RAGE
himself. Not, though, before "touching" the ghostbrain.
Jim still did not know if the thing had distenanted Ore's
intelligence or was taking it over as slowly as some cancers
ate up a body. What made him "shudder" when he touched
it was that it touched him back. Something had definitely
though briefly put its "finger" on him. Jim had been shot
with loathing then. Yet, he had had the feeling that there
was something vaguely familiar about it.
After returning to his room, Jim rested a few minutes.
Faintly through the wall on one side came the sound of a girl
sobbing. Through the other wall Jim Morrison shrieked the
words of "Horse Latitudes" while The Doors banged,
twanged, and pounded. The lyric was one of Jim's favor-
ites, true poetry, he thought. He had not heard this 1967 hit
for a long time, but Monique Bragg liked to tune in the
"Golden Oldies" program.
Jim sighed. He did not want to put off reentry. For the
moment, he was too wrung out by the sexual frenzies to
start chanting again. Though he had not exerted himself
physically in a direct sense, his role as a not so innocent
bystander had worn him out. He now knew all there was to
know about tender love, learned while Ore was making love
to the native woman. He also knew too much of violent
love, as demonstrated by Vala and Ore. Though his erotic
adventures had been few on Earth, he, as Ore, had had
enough to make Casanova and Henry Miller look like
bumbling lovers.
More minutes passed. Finally, he shot himself through
the black center. His target was six years later. Surely, this
time. Ore would be in a relatively happy situation. Statis-
tically, there were bound to be such.

By Shambarimem's Horn! Ore was back in a suite in his
father's original city-palace. No one else was in it, and no
sound came through the heavily barred and open window.
243
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
He had been captured again while trying to make his way
through the city of Golgonooza, the killing of Los his goal.
Vala had gated out to somewhere. That was seven months
ago. And he, Ore, had been taken to his childhood home,
the palace of the clouds, and imprisoned there.
Jim was shocked to find out that that was not all Los had
done to his son. Ore's body felt peculiar. It had muscles it
had never possessed, and its legs and feet were numbed past
feeling, and it moved in a frightening and strange manner.
Then Jim saw Ore's reflection in a towering mirror. His
surprise and horror were so intense that he came close to
tearing loose and returning to Earth. The naked body of the
Lord was, from the genitals upward, just as it had been. But
the lower part was a serpent's. Ore had no legs. He was
joined to a gigantic snake's body fifty feet long, its scales a
bright green. At regular intervals, the green bore five-
angled scarlet patches. Ore's torso was held upright by the
powerful forward part of the reptilian body. He moved
across the floor as a python moved.
He had become an ophidian centaur, half-man, half-
snake.
Jim knew enough of Thoan science and history to know
who had brought about this metamorphosis. Los, instead of
killing his son, was torturing him again. He had used the
biological knowledge and means still available to the Lords
to make this monster. His son's legs had been lopped off,
and he had been fleshily welded to a headless snake.
Sometimes, Los came to this now-deserted palace to
mock and to jeer at Ore. He had told his son that
Enithannon was back with him. After their reconciliation,
they had had three more children. These were Vala, named
after the aunt because Enithannon desired it, Palamabron,
and Theotormon. All had been bome by surrogate mothers.
Ore had been the only one Enithannon had carried. She had
244
wanted to experience natural childbirth at least once. That one
time had been enough to discourage her from having more.
"However, I have learned my lesson," Los had said.
"From now on, as soon as the children become adults, I will
send them on to other worlds. Some of these will be
unoccupied by Lords, their masters or mistresses having
been slain. On others, my children will have to test their
wits and agility against the rulers."
Enithannon did not know that her son was being held
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (166 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
prisoner or that he had become a monster. Los had told her
that he had learned that Ore was safe in the world of
Manathu Vorcyon. That ancient woman had adopted him,
and he was continuing his education in her peaceful
universe. Someday, Los would permit Enithannon to visit
Ore. That would have to be a long time from now, though.
It would happen when the passionate hatred of Los and Ore
had cooled down.
Meanwhile, Los was keeping Enithannon busy with
raising children—with the help of many servants.
Ore did not know if his father was telling the truth or not.
It was possible that his mother was still imprisoned or had
been murdered.
Jim touched the ghostbrain again and was touched back.
It definitely had become larger.
He decided to stay with Ore for a while. He was
fascinated with the study of the conjunction of man and
snake. The first thing he noted was the connection of the
circulatory systems of the two bodies. The reptile was
warm-blooded, which meant that it was not really a reptile.
Its body had been made in Los's laboratory to meld with
Ore's, which required that the same kind of blood run
through it. The serpent body had its own heart since the
human heart alone could not have pumped nearly enough
blood for the immense bulk.
245
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
The front end merged with the human part just below
Ore's anus and his genitals. But he was spared the humili-
ation of having to excrete on the back of the serpent and
befouling himself. The food he ate went through intestines
in his stomach and then was shunted to the ophidian's
stomach. Part of his urine had to go through his own urinary
canal; most of it went through the serpent part.
To stay alive and healthy, he was forced to eat and drink
huge quantities. If he tried to starve himself to death, he would
suffer not only his own hunger pangs but the serpent's.
"Metaphorically, you've always been a snake," Los had
said. "Now, you're metaphor and reality combined."
"A snake who can bite!" Ore had howled. "A serpent
who can crush you!"
His father had laughed. Then he had said, "When I catch
Vala, I'll make her into a fit mate for you. I look forward to
watching you two coiled together while making snakish
love. Trying to do it, anyway. That'll be a sight never seen
before!"
Ore did not reply. He did not wish Los to know how
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (167 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

much he longed for companionship, especially female,
especially Vala's.
Escape seemed to be impossible. Trap-beset gates were
just beyond the single door and the four windows. Los
never entered the room, though he sometimes opened the
door to jeer at his son. Usually, he talked to Ore from a TV
wall-screen. He liked waking Ore up in the middle of the
night. Ore did not become angry about this. The time of day
or night meant little to him, and he welcomed the sound or
sight of a human being, even of his father. Of course, he
would not let Los know that.
Three months after capture. Ore's two bodies broke out in
jewels.
246
CHAPTER 29
/\T FIRST, ORC thought that he was suffering from a carbun-
cular infection. Hard nodes sprang up mushroom-swift on
both bodies, though his face and neck were free of them. They
itched intensely, and the thin skin over the hard swellings
broke at the slightest scratch. A little blood but no pus flowed
from the ruptures. The broken skin revealed a many-faceted
substance that was rubbery in its initial stages. Then it became
as hard as a gem. The growths could be of any color or shade.
Ore realized that he was not infected with any ordinary
disease. The Thoan were immune to pimples and boils or, in
fact, any skin infection. Los must be responsible for the
outbreak.
In a week's time, the swellings had grown larger. They
were the size of a walnut and much harder than the shell.
The skin over them stretched without breaking. After the
first three days of growth, they had ceased to make the skin
itch. Ore had quit scratching, and the cuts made by his nails
had healed within five hours.
247
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Fortunately, the swellings had not appeared on the
underside of the serpent body. It would have made move-
ment across the smooth floor both painful and difficult. As
it was, even its sidewinder method of locomotion did not
prevent his ever-looping tail from slipping now and then.
When Los came to the doorway or his face was videoed, he
refused to answer Ore's questions. He only said, "It is not a
disease."
All the skin over the bumps broke in the same hour. Their
contents fell onto the floor, clinking as they did. They
looked like cut gems, and they twinkled in the light.
Shortly after that, Los opened the door. He stood there
and laughed for a long time. Then, he said, "You're a living
treasure. Ore, your own gem mine and jewelsmith. You'll
be up to your ass, your human ass, in diamonds, emeralds,
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (168 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
garnets, rubies, sapphires, amethysts, and chrysoberyls.   i
You may even drown in them.                            ,
"Thank me, my son. Your father has heaped riches upon   j
you, though you deserve only ashes and dung. The tale of your   |
unfortunate fortune and strange death will spread throughout
the worlds—I'll see to that—and you will become a legend to
rival Shambarimem's and Manathu Vorcyon's."
For reply. Ore bent his body so that he was a few inches
above the floor. He scooped up a handful of the still-wet
gems, straightened back, and hurled them through the
doorway. Los did not move except to make a slight step
backward, then to resume his position.
As the jewels shot through the doorway, they vanished.
Ore had established that a gate was there.
"You'll see only my face on the wall from now on," Los
said. "You've no way to get rid of the gems. Drown in your
sea of beauty!"
He closed the door. Shortly thereafter, a small round
ceiling panel slid aside. Through the hole dropped the
248
RED ORC'S RAGE
gems, one by one, that he had cast at Los. Ore took these
and the others and dropped them into the privy hole. Ten
minutes later, all reappeared from the ceiling hole.
Jim unmoored himself from Ore and returned to his room
on Earth. Immediately, he began chanting. On his return to
Ore, four Thoan months had passed. The Lord was taking
plates piled with food from the revolving tray in the wall.
He had been forced to eat and drink immense quantities to
provide the energy to make the jewels. Almost all his time
had been spent in ingestion and excretion. Because his
hunger and thirst woke him up every two hours, he slept in
spurts. If he had tried to cut down his intake to a normal
diet, he would have dehydrated in less than a day and would
have starved to death in three days.
The jewels were three inches thick on the floor. When Ore
tried to crawl over them, he slipped and slid and had much
trouble getting from one place to another. However, he had
tried a new technique of locomotion recently, and it worked.
Instead of carrying his human body vertically, he put it in a
straight line with his serpent body. Then he cleared the jewels
ahead of him out of the way with his hands.
Eventually, the gems would be piled so high that he
would not be able to make a path.
The question now was whether he would die of weakness
or of suffocation first. The time would come when he would
not be able to get to the food tray and the water faucet. The
jewels would cover them too deeply.
For the first time in Ore's life, he despaired. Death
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (169 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
seemed to be the only exit from this room. Jim felt just as
hopeless and spiritless as Ore. Also, the ghostbrain seemed
to be getting larger, though its menace would cease when
Ore died. At the moment, it looked as if the solution to both
problems could be that.
After twelve trips, Jim entered Ore on the night that the
249
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
Lord had to escape or die soon. The jewels were only
several feet from the ceiling. To reach the food tray and the
water faucet, Ore had to dig two wide and deep holes.
These had been caving in soon after being made, thus
forcing him to excavate every day. He had given up on
trying to get to the privy hole. As a result, the room stank,
reminding Jim of old man Dumski's outhouse pit.
The room was being monitored through wall screens and,
perhaps, with other sensors. Los would be observing only
occasionally unless he carried a small receiver with him. He
might have stationed servants to observe the room on a
twenty-four-hour basis. Certainly, he would be instantly noti-
fied automatically by machine or by an operator if his prisoner
did anything untoward. However, the wall panels up to several
feet within the ceiling were now covered with the jewels. But
disguised monitor screens would be on the ceiling.
Ore thought of covering the exposed areas of the wall and
the ceiling with his excrement. But, as soon as the monitors
were blinded, Los would be called.
He scooped a hole by the wall above the faucet. That
would not alarm the monitors; they had seen him do this
every time he wanted a drink of water. When he came to the
faucet, he gripped it. It would, he hoped, not tear out from
the wall from the stress he planned to put on it. Most of his
serpentine body was stretched out across the room. Holding
on to the metal faucet while he exchanged hands to maintain
his grip. Ore rolled around and around.
Observing this, the human watchers might believe that he
was having a seizure of some sort. They might call Los.
However, it would not look to them as if he were doing
anything that could aid him to escape. And they would wait
a while to see what, if anything, he was up to.
As he rolled, the jewels around his human body fell in
and covered him. The snake body was also soon buried,
250
though it was closer to the surface than the human part. He
then groped around with the tip of the tail until he felt one of
the upright tempered-vanadium bars making a frame in front
of a window. Extended a few feet more, the tail coiled around
the bar.
If the frame had been welded to the metal wall, it would
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (170 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
resist his mightiest efforts. As it was, he did not have his
full strength. But, after he strained until sweat slicked his
body and stung his eyes and the veins swelled to the size of
tiny serpents, the frame popped out. It screeched, a sound
the monitors would detect.
Though of very thick and hard metal, the faucet had bent
sideways.
Now, he came up and out of the hard but loose pile over
him. His fore part forming a straight line with the serpentine
part, he clawed at the jewels before him while the tail
sidewound frantically. He got to the window quickly. Then,
he pushed himself along the wall for several feet. After he
stopped, he began to hammer his tail against the window.
At first, the mineralline growths under the skin softened the
pain from the blows. The only hurt he suffered, and it was
almost too much, was from the skin breaking over the
immature jewels. But these were ripped out and off after
twenty or so impacts. This caused him a greater pain. And
the unbuffered slamming of the tail made him clench his
teeth with agony. Blood smeared the window.
Just when he thought that he could no longer continue his
weakening blows, the window fell out. Immediately, the
jewels by it cascaded outwards. He writhed to the opening
and stuck his tail out and above the opening. It groped
around along the wall above the window until it found
something upright and standing in a niche. He curved his
tail around its base as an anchor. Then he extended his head
and shoulders through the opening.
257
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
The only illumination was moonlight, but he could see
that the object his tail had gripped was a metal statue. Now
he knew exactly where he was in this huge and complex
palace-city. He was on the north side of one of the first
buildings erected on the lowest level. It was over two
thousand years old, and his parents had been talking for a
long time about tearing it down and building a new one. Its
too ornate rococo style was no longer to their taste.
The palace lights came on. He saw no sign of life. The
TV watchers were probably the only tenants left, the others
having gone to Golgonooza. Los, of course, would have
been awakened. He may already have gated through to this
building or one nearby.
He tightened the tail's grip around the legs of the statue
and slithered out of the window. For a moment, he was
hanging face down to the full length of his two bodies. Then
his mighty ophidian muscles raised him, and he twisted the
snake body until he faced the wall. He rose until he could
grasp the shoulders of the statue. He uncoiled his tail from
the base of the statue. Almost, his fingers gave way under the
weight of the momentarily dragging tail. Then he raised the
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (171 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
latter part and coiled a length around the statue above. Thus
progressing from statue to statue, he got to the roof.
As he had expected, several flying craft of various types
and sizes were hangared in one comer. When he got to
them, he chose an all-white craft of the Steed II class. This
was large enough to accommodate his huge bulk. Getting
into the pilot's front seat so that he could operate the Steed
was not easy. He had to jam the front part of the serpent
through the space between the two seats. Then, he had to
curve it so that his human part would be able to reach the
controls. Since he lacked feet, he had to operate the pedals
with his hands. That made for awkward flying when the
252
RED ORC'S RAGE
craft was not on automatic, but he could do it safely if he
was careful during certain maneuvers.
He hoped that the vocal code which started the engine
had not been changed. It had not. But that did not mean that
the concealed self-destruction device would not explode. It
could be set for automatic activation or by a radio signal
from Los. Also, there could be an override which would
take control from the unauthorized pilot. Then Los could
direct it to land wherever he chose.
Ore was going to take his chances. He had no other choice.
None of the craft was armed or had hand weapons aboard.
Light beams sprang out from each side. They were about
ten feet long and fan-shaped. Under Ore's control, they
began flapping up and down as swiftly as a hummingbird's
wings. The craft rose slowly, the light flashes of the Sethi
engine becoming a blur. Ore turned on the radar, infrared,
and headlights. The bright flashes from the side were going
to be seen by anyone in his path so he might as well have a
good view ahead of him.
It took six minutes of savage acceleration to put one
hundred and fifty miles behind him. The lights of Golgo-
nooza brightened swiftly as he decelerated. By now, Los
must have gated to the palace, learned what had happened,
including the theft of the Steed, and gated back to Golgo-
nooza. Or he was just about to do so. He would guess
correctly that his son would not fly elsewhere to take refuge
while he was still part serpent.
Whether Los had gone to the palace and returned or had
never gone, he was now in his new city. Ore angled the
vessel steeply downward toward his landing place, the plaza
by the swirl-domed towering residence of Los. As he did
so, he saw his father. He was running, staggering rather,
across the plaza. He was clad only in a short kilt, and he
wore a belt holding a holster that contained a beamer. One
hand was clasped to his side as if it hurt.

Ahead of him, her white and gauzy night robe flapping be-
hind her, ran his mother. Enitharmon's slim legs were pump-
ing swiftly, and she looked desperate. Although Los could
have stunned or killed her with his beamer, he was so furious
and, possibly, so injured that he had forgotten about the weapon.
Or he did not want to use it unless he was forced to do so.
As Ore brought the Steed around in a curve to get behind
Los, he saw that the hilt and part of the blade of a dagger
stuck out between Los's fingers. Evidently, Enitharmon had
stabbed him between the ribs, though not deeply. That
meant that she had not been imprisoned in one section of the
palace or had been released from it. Or his father had been
lying about locking her up. In any event, his mother had
found out what he had done to their son. She had inter-
cepted him before he could take effective action against
Ore. There had been a struggle, and she had slipped the
blade into his side. Then, she had fled.
The Sethi wings made no noise. Los had not seen their
flashing or was too intent on catching his wife for the lights
to register. Ore took the craft down to about six feet above
the multicolored luminescent pavement and shot it toward
Los's back. Enitharmon had stumbled and fallen on one
knee. That was long enough for Los, screaming, to overtake
her. He clutched her by the throat with both hands as she
tried to get up. She was now on both knees, her body bent
backward as she clutched Los's wrists.
Before the bow of Ore's craft rammed into a point
between Los's shoulders, Enitharmon had released her right
hand and jerked the dagger loose from his body. He cried
out with the pain. She started to plunge it into Los's belly,
but he was knocked forward by the aircraft's prow, and her
dagger struck his breastbone at an angle. Then his body
carried her to the floor. The dagger lay close to her hand on
the ground. But the impact of the bow against Los was not
254
as violent as Ore could have made it. Even though rage
filled him, it had not taken over all his wits. He did not wish
to injure his mother by driving Los too hard against her.
And he did not want to kill Los. Not yet.
Even so, she sprawled beneath Los. He lay heavily
facedown upon her, his arms outflung. He was stunned or
unconscious. Enitharmon was not trying to roll him over
and away from her. She must have been stunned when the
back of her head struck the pavement.
Ore raised the canopy of the aircraft. He crawled out of the
vessel and to his parents. Enitharmon, looking up and past
Los's shoulder, screamed. Even if Los had told her what he
had done to Ore, the sight of him far exceeded the shock of the
mental image. And the blood covering Ore must have added to
the horror caused by his monstrous body.
"It is I, Mother!" he croaked.
He bent down and picked up the dagger from the pavement.
She was silent now and staring with eyes as wide open as
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (173 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
possible. Ore rolled the still-unmoving body of his father over
and slid off his kilt and loincloth. A few seconds later,
Enitharmon screamed again and did not stop for some time.
Ore had cut off Los's testicles. Then, straightening up to a
vertical position, he slipped the two balls from the sac and
popped them into his mouth. Cheeks bulging, he began chewing.
Rage and the legends that the ancient Lords had done this
to then- enemies had inspired him to do this deed. And it
was possible that the serpentine part of him overrode the
human revulsion at the act. Ore had become half animal in
more than his conjoining of flesh with a snake.
Whatever had driven Ore to this act, it was too much for
Jim Crimson. He did not have to chant to release himself
from the Lord. The shock and disgust cut the mental cord,
and he was back in his room. He was shaking and felt as if
he had to vomit.

CHAPTER 30
f i
I KNOW YOU'RE anything but pleased with me, Doctor,"
Jim Grimson said. "You ordered me not to reenter, but I
couldn't help it. Ore was as much a drug as angel dust. I
swear I'll never reenter again! Never! Not until you tell me
to do it! And I won't want to do that, I can tell you for sure!
I got that compulsion out of my system!
"I loathe Red Ore! I'll admit, like I told you, that I got a
very funny sensation when he bit into his father's balls! I
enjoyed it, just for a couple of seconds, though! That's
because I was so far into being Ore I almost was him! Then
I got real sick! For a moment, the sickness made me become
myself enough to get out of Ore! If that hadn't happened, I
might still be in him!"
Porsena's face was unreadable. Jim believed that he was
really pissed on" at him. He just wasn't showing it. However,
his words so far had been as sharp and as hard-driven as arrows.
The psychiatrist now spoke more softly. "You've been
256
RED ORC'S RAGE
told to call me or my staff at once if you feel your desire is
getting too strong for you to resist it. You should have done
that. I expect that, from now on, you will. You are, in a
psychological sense, in shark-filled waters. To be precise,
you're at a turning point. When a person is at that stage, he
can go ahead or go back. You understand?"
Jim nodded. He said, "God knows I tried! I know now I
can't make it on my own. I'll do everything exactly as you
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (174 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
tell me to do."
"Not until the reason for the orders or suggestions has
been explained to you. The patient should fully comprehend
the why and wherefore of his therapy."
"I know. You tell me that every time we're about ready
to go into another therapy phase."
The doctor smiled. He said, "You're astute, in some
things, anyway. That's one reason your therapy has pro-
gressed more swiftly and along somewhat different lines
from the others. You're ready, in my judgment, for the
shedding phase."
Jim said, "But . . . but! I mean, there are some things
I just have to know! Like, what about the ghostbrain? And
I wanted to be there when Ore made the Earth-universe and
its twin! God, what a sight that would've been, like
watching God create the world! No, like being God because
Ore would be doing it, and I'd be Ore!
"And I wanted to find out how Ore got his complete
human body back! And there's Los! When I left, it looked
like Los was dead and done with. But Farmer says Los was
still living when Kickaha went into the Lords' worlds!"
"Farmer may write the sixth book in the series and
enlighten you about all those. Whether he does or not, we
have certain absolutely required procedures to follow. What
if you were addicted to heroin and pleaded with me to allow
you to keep taking it because you'd miss future highs if you
kicked the habit? You do see the parallel?"
257
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
"Well, OK," Jim said slowly. "Easy for you to say,
though."
"That's because I am objective."
"Yeah, I know."
"Think about Ore when he was on the island of the dmg
users, the lotus eaters. Do you want to be in his condition?
He certainly had no craving to continue taking the drugs
after he had gone through the agonies of quitting cold
turkey. You went through his pain with him. Keep that
torture in mind if you're ever tempted to take drugs again."
Doctor Porsena leaned forward over his desk and church-
steepled his hands.
"I want you to think hard about the questions I'm going to
throw at you. Consider all the angles you can think of. Ore
was in Anthema, the Unwanted World. Ore's father placed
him there. What does that suggest and imply to you?"
There was silence while Jim thought, his mouth twisted
with the effort and his eyes rolling around. Finally, he said,
"My father, I mean Ore's father, put him there. I suppose
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (175 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
you're thinking I named Anthema the Unwanted World
because my father did not want me? He sent me, I mean
Ore, there because he was not wanted. That sounds good,
but I didn't make up the name of Anthema. It wasn't just my
unconscious mind working overtime."
For some reason, Jim's heartbeat had stepped up. He was
beginning to sweat a little, too.
The doctor said, "Los loved Ore when Ore was a child
or, at least, was very fond of him. He treated his son with
kindness and care then. But, occasionally, he was very
abusive, even then. When Ore became an adolescent and
was no longer the cute and lovely infant, his father seemed
to hate him."
"No 'seemed,'" Jim said. "He did!"
"That suggests?"
258
RED ORC'S RAGE
"My relations with my father were sort of like Ore's,
weren't they?"
Porsena, instead of answering, said, "What about your
visions when you were a child?"
"Hallucinations, you mean?"
"Let's call them visions. Your first attack of stigmata
occurred when you were five. You were in church with your
mother. The statue of the crucified Christ fascinated you.
You suddenly saw it as a real man, not a carved wooden
figure who was suspended by nails from a cross and whose
blood was merely paint. You screamed."
"I still don't know what scared me."
"That's not vitally important. Immediately after you
screamed, blood welled from your hands and feet and on
your forehead. You became hysterical, your mother, also.
Then ..."
"Then there was the man I saw floating by my bedroom
window when I was four!" Jim said. "And the naked green
man I saw out in our garden six months later. He was eating
the ears of corn! I yelled for Mom, but when she came, the
green man was gone! I got whipped by my father for lying!
But I did see that man! I did!"
"How do you feel about the vision you had just before
you passed out in your burning house?" the doctor said.
"You were naked and chained to a tree and a giant sickle
was about to castrate you. Also, what are your feelings
about the vision you had of the man-serpent?"
"They were prophetic. They predicted what was going to
happen when I was in Ore. Sort of, anyway. They were
mixed up, but their elements were true. They did happen."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (176 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
"I didn't ask you if you thought they were true or what
their psychological explanation was. I asked you how you
feel when you think of them."
"For Christ's sake, Doctor!" Jim burst out. "I don't feel
259
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
anything at all about it! I can see what you're getting at!
You think I made up Ore being made into a half-snake thing
because I'd dreamed about the man-serpent!"
"I am not trying to invalidate your experiences. I am
merely suggesting certain parallels. The interpretations will
be yours. However, allow me to point out that you deny
feeling anything about it. Yet you responded with more than
a little anger. For the present, we'll not go into that. You
think about it, then tell me your conclusions."
Jim leaned forward, his hands holding tight to the arms of
the chair. His heart was beating even harder than it had a
moment ago, and he was sweating more heavily. What he felt
was, he felt as if he'd like to get out of the office. Right now.
"Look, Doc!" he said harshly. But even he could hear an
underlying note of pleading. "Where I went and what I saw
and did, I mean, what Ore did, was no fantasy! It was all
true, and I don't care what parallels there are to my life here
on Earth and there in the Lords' universes! Hell, I could
find parallels between my life and a thousand others on
Earth! There is such a thing as coincidence, you know! No
matter how crazily I might fantasize, I can do things, know
things, no fantasies could teach me! Like speaking Thoan,
for instance! You want to hear fluent Thoan?
"Samon-ke fath? Meaning, Where do I go from here?
Orc-tam Ore man-kirn. Yem tath Orc-tha. Meaning, Ore
was once just called Ore. Now, he's called Red Ore. If you
want me to, I'll rattle off a long story in Thoan. And I'll
give you the grammar, too!
"And where would I learn how to work flint into knives,
arrowheads, spearpoints, scrapers, chisels, you name it?
Bring me a core of raw flint, I'll shape from it any tool
anybody can make from flint! How could I know how to do
that unless I'd really been in Ore's mind and had seen him
260
and Ijim work flint and then brought back how to do it
stored in my memory?
"Then there's the whiplashes I brought back from the time
Ore got whipped by the slave driver! Yeah, I know I've had
stigmata, and maybe that's just psychosomatic stuff! But that
time, I just didn't bleed from my back! The cuts made by the
whip were there, too! They hurt like hell, they were real!
"Then there's the controlled wet dreams I learned from
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (177 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Ore! You're starting to control the dreams and delusions of
the patients, but they can't hold a candle to my controlled
dreams for control or realism! How'd I leam to do that? On
my own? No way! I learned it from Ore!
"I could go on, but you got more than enough to make
you wonder if maybe I'm not telling the truth, haven't you?
And I suppose you think just because Ore cut off his father's
balls I'd like to cut off my father's?"
Doctor Porsena said, "Would you?"
"Yeah, there're times when I'd've been glad to! But I
swear, mad as I've been at him, I never once thought about
doing that. Maybe stringing him up by them. But cutting
them off and eating them—raw, for God's sake—never! So
how come, if I'm just imagining Ore and what he does, did
he do something I'd never thought of?"
"You tell me."
"Oh, sure, it was my unconscious mind did it!"
"And . . . ?"
"And? What else? Oh, well, there's my imagination. It's
a free-wheeling extrapolator, according to Mister Lum.
Takes a basic premise or fact or idea and builds logically
from that. Maybe you could be right about that. But not
about the other stuff. Not my speaking Thoan and working
flint and, I didn't mention this before, my knowledge of
biology and chemistry I couldn't have learned unless I'd
tapped into Ore's mind. That can't be explained."
267
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Jim tried to lean back and relax.
"Listen, Doctor! We can settle this! You can put me on
the lie detector machine, question me all you want, and then
you'll see I'm not lying!"
"You're my patient, not a criminal. Besides, if you
believe that you have actually gone into Ore's universe, the
lie detector would indicate that you're not lying. But I'm
not the inquisitor, and you're not on the rack. The truth or
falsity of the patient's experiences are not my consideration
or concern. I don't care whether they really happened or
not. I accept that they did happen inasmuch as they concern
the therapy. That is, what is the relevance of the experiences
to the therapy? What progress or regress derives from them?
Those are the only significant questions. Do you read me?"
"Sure! But . . . isn't it important, needful to science, to
everybody, to know that there might be other worlds out
there? Parallel universes? And at least one person, me,
maybe three, since Kickaha and Wolff went there, has been
there! Aren't you interested at all in that? If I can go, if they
can, too, then everybody should be interested!"
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (178 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

"That is true, given your premises. As I said, at the moment
only your therapeutic progress concerns me. It's all that should
concern you. Now, Jim, I understand that your parents are
coming here tomorrow to say good-bye to you. They're
leaving for1 Texas the day after. Your father has finally
consented to face you. That meeting is very important as a test
of how you'll react to stress. Will you be so angry that you
become violent and attack him? What will you do if he attacks
you first? Will you avoid provocative behavior? And what will
your reaction be after the meeting is over?"
He and Jim talked about the possibilities and how Jim
could handle the situation. The psychiatrist did not expect
Jim not to be angry. He did want Jim's display of rage,
whatever form it took, to be appropriate.
262
RED ORC'S RAGE
"As you know, shortly after you were admitted here, I
advised both your father and your mother to go into
therapy," Doctor Porsena said. "When a patient enters
treatment, his family should also enter. They refused. Their
main plea was that they could not afford it. But ..."
"The real reason was that they thought I was the only
crazy one in the family!" Jim burst out. "They thought they
didn't need therapy! Hah!"
"Then you'll have to leam how to handle all that
appropriately and positively."
Doctor Porsena glanced at the clock.
"Just one more question, Jim. It was put to you some
time ago, but I want to hear your response as of this
moment. What is the main thing that you have learned about
Ore's character?"
Jim hunkered down in the chair, frowning. Then he sat up.
"The night I took all those trips ... it was a lifetime.
I'd say that the main thing I learned was this.
"Ore had a lot of good qualities, courage, endurance, inge-
nuity, and desire to leam. He was passionate about everything
he did. Oh, he was passionate, all right! But his passion was
separated from real love. I don't think he really loved anybody
but his mother and his aunt. And I'm not sure that that love
wasn't basically lust. Passion without love is no good.
"Not bad for an eighteen-year-old blue-collar dummy,
heh?"
"Not bad," the doctor said. "I don't know if you mean it
when you call yourself a dummy. But we're not through
working on your self-esteem."
"Another thing," Jim said. "The Thoan. My God!
They're thousands of years old and like gods in many
respects. But they're locked into war and conquest and
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (179 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

jealousy and murder and torture and all sorts of bad things.
They haven't progressed spiritually or emotionally in all
263
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
those thousands of years. They're stuck, and there's no
hope for them to get unstuck. That, I say, is like most
people on Earth. They're stuck!"
The psychiatrist nodded. "I'll point out another item," he
said. "Ore is to be admired for his ingenuity and wit in getting
through the many obstacles in his way and in getting out of the
many traps set for him. What Ore did, you can do. There are
many obstacles on Earth and many traps, economic, social,
psychological. You, like Ore, can use your ingenuity and wit
to overcome the obstacles and spring yourself from the traps.
"And you don't have to be a dull conformist, as you have
phrased it during previous sessions. You're afraid you'll be
a square, part of the establishment, if you behave within
certain moral and ethical bounds. But you can be a genuine
individualist without being antisocial."
"Yeah," Jim said, his tone indicating that he was not
fully confident. "Still, there are things I'd like to know. The
ghostbrain, for instance. What was it really? I don't suppose
it makes much difference if it takes over Ore. It'll act just
like he would. In a sense, it'll be Ore. At least, that's what
I thought. Only ..."
"Only what?"
"Well, just before I parted from Ore the last time, I was
so sickened that I didn't pay much attention to what the
ghostbrain was doing just then. It seemed to have advanced
on me. I mean, it had gotten a lot closer or a lot bigger,
depending on the way you look at it. In fact, it seemed,
somehow, to have surrounded me, half-surrounded, any-
way. It was like a giant black amoeba getting ready to
surround and ingest a smaller cell. If I hadn't left Ore just
then, well, I don't know.
"I was thinking about it the other day. How about this
idea? I was wrong thinking it came from that blue stuff
floating around on Anthema. Suppose it was—this'll kill
264
RED ORC'S RAGE
you—suppose the ghostbrain was not some alien thing
menacing Ore? I mean, what if it was some kind of a
shadow of Ore's brain? What really happened was that I was
sensing that Ore's brain was about to take me over, and it
looked like a sinister alien shadow to me? I scared myself
into thinking it was a danger to Ore. But there really wasn't
any alien in Ore's brain except me? And something in Ore
sensed me and was going to absorb me? Ore was uncon-
scious of this. But a mechanism in his neural system was
automatically treating me as if I was an enemy?
"If that's true, then I was scared for nothing about it
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (180 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

being a force ready to become Ore and throw him out. But
I had good reason to be scared. I was going to be the victim,
the possessed, or, I should say, the ingested! Only Ore was
going to do the ingesting!"
"An excellent hypothesis," the psychiatrist said. "Quite
possibly, perhaps most probably, that was what it was all about.
I congratulate you on a brilliant solution to that problem."
"Thanks. But what does that mean? You didn't say it was
the right solution."
"No," the doctor said, "but it is very probably the correct
one. If you think it is, then it is. You're the person to know."
He smiled, and he rose from his chair. "Time's up, Jim.
See you next session."
He flipped the intercom switch. "Winnie. Send in Sandy
Melton, please."
Reluctantly, feeling that there was so much more to
discuss, Jim went into the waiting room, nodded at Winnie,
and stepped into the hall. It was, for the moment, empty of
people. Music came down the hall from a half-closed door.
When he was closer to Sue Binker's room, he recognized
Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach, issued by Tomato
Music, a record company that dared take chances on
unconventional stuff.
265
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
As he strode by the door, he glanced through the opening.
He saw Sue Sinker's mantra on her wall. It was a looped
cross, the ancient Egyptian ankh, formed by the Tiers series
covers. One illustration, that from the British edition of A
Private Cosmos, caught and held his eye. The background
was an eerie landscape. In the foreground were Kickaha,
holding the Horn of Shambarimem, and the laboratory-
made harpy, Podarge. She was either attacking Kickaha or
about to screw him. It was hard to tell.
Whoosh!
Subaudio sound.
Jim was hurtling through the eye of the loop on top of the
cross.
The eye expanded to admit him.
Before he could scream, he was in Ore.
Behind him, or seeming to be behind him, was another
unheard sound. It was the clang of an iron door shutting.
Jim knew instantly (without knowing how he knew) that
the young Lord was now called Red Ore. His many slayings
of Lords and leblabbiys had earned him that title. He was
standing on the edge of a high plateau in a flickering
crimson light which came from the horizon and stained the
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (181 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
blue sky. Around him were warriors, all of them leblabbiy,
clad in green armor and scarlet feathers, their faces heavily
tattooed. They were firing with howitzer-sized beamers at
the horde below. The purple rays were blowing up the
forest, earth, and men; huge trees and men's bodies were
flying through the red-shot black smoke.
That non-Lords were operating such technologically
advanced weapons meant that the war between Ore and Los
had made both sides desperate. Never before had the
leblabbiy been allowed to use any but the most primitive
weapons. The plains forces' (Los's) projectors were knock-
ing off chunks of the cliff and precipitating groups of Ore's
266
RED ORC-S RAGE
warriors with them to the ground four thousand feet below.
Red Ore was very anxious about the flickering crimson
light on the horizon. He thought that it must be made by a
long-lost pre-Thoan weapon that Los had found during his
long flight from his son. Ore now regretted more than ever
that he had not killed Los at once after castrating him in
Golgonooza. While Ore was attending to his mother, Los
had escaped.
Through the smoke. Ore saw the wall, vengeful as an
angry god's eye, speeding toward the plateau. Mountain-
sized orange gouts were mixed with it, gouts that left behind
them, where Ore could see through the smoke, vast craters.
(The size of those on Earth's moon, Jim thought.) They
would destroy Los's own Lord allies and leblabbiy auxilia-
ries before they reached Ore's army. Los, who must be far
away over the horizon and operating this apocalyptic
weapon, did not care. If he cracked the planet in half but
killed his son, he would be happy.
Ore turned and sprinted toward a gate he had set up for
escape if things did not go well.
Just as Red Ore leaped through it, Jim managed to tear
himself loose by chanting the Siberian shamanic spell. He
felt a pain as if he had been attached to Ore by an umbilical
cord which had been yanked away from him, tearing off the
tender flesh.
The pain came and went swiftly. Jim heard two other
noiseless noises: a whooshing and then a clanging. He had
just enough time in transit to hope that he was back in his
own body.
He was not. But, though again in the young Lord, he was
in another time and place. This world had belonged to
Uveth the Vortex, one of Urizen's iron-hearted daughters
and Los's ally in the apocalyptic struggle between Ore and
his father. Ore had, after suitable torture, slain her. It was

also many years after Ore had fled the cracking in two of the
planet on which he had been fighting Los.
He was locked in a sexual frenzy with his own child,
Vala, named after his aunt. His ecstasy was so intense that
his loins seemed to be interwoven with silken fires. A choir
with voices too beautiful to be real sang around him.
Jim detected the shadowy ghostbrain, but it was moving
very slowly toward him. That pace, he figured later, was
sluggish because Ore was so raptured that every atom of his
being was caught up in it. Jim was also entangled in the
silken and fiery threads, but he made the most desperately
violent effort of his life. He slipped loose.
He was in the ward hall and was just completing the step
which he had started as he glimpsed Sue's mantra. His visits
had taken only half a second of Earth time.
He stopped, wheeled, closing one eye so that he could
not see the mantra again, and headed back toward Doctor
Porsena's office. The psychiatrist would not be available
because he was in a session with Sandy Melton. But he had
told Jim to go to him or a staff member at once if he ever
had a flashback. Jim had verbally agreed, though, in his
mind, he had pooh-poohed the idea that he would succumb
to the siren call of the World of Tiers.
Shaking, sweating, anxiety brooding in him like a big
black bird over her black eggs, he ran to Doctor Tarchuna's
office.
Jim now believed that there was a hell. It was in Red Ore
in the worlds of the Lords. But a heaven was also there,
though one could not exist without the other.
Jim wanted nothing of either one.
"Holy Mother!" he shouted as he banged open the office
door. "Help me! Help me!"
268
CHAPTER 3 1
L/OCTOR PORSENA SAT in his office and considered the next
session with Jim Crimson. It would be his last as an
inpatient. On the same day, Jim would start living with the
Wyzaks. Leaving the ward environment would frighten
Jim. Departure was often as traumatic as entering the
hospital. Jim, however, was much better equipped emotion-
ally and mentally to withstand the shocks and troubles of the
"world out there" than the night on which he had been
admitted.
Jim had been in great danger of being cocooned into his
fantasy. A fully withdrawn patient, ceasing to respond to
any stimuli outside his mind, he would have adventured
inside his skull as Red Ore. Nor would he have been the Jim
Grimson who was copartner in the Lord's physical and
mental life. He would have been absorbed into Ore like

water into a superdry sponge. Nothing of him would have
been left.
269
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
After his flashblack, Jim had stayed as an inpatient for an
extra week. He had not been given intensive treatment until
after he was tranquilized for several days. Then, no longer
taking Thorazine, he had had as many private sessions as he
had needed. Neither Jim nor the psychiatrist had slept much
during this period. Porsena had kept up with the regular
work schedule while treating Jim.
In the meantime. The Scarlet Letterer had been caught
while putting up on the wall one of his rest-room graffiti.
This time, however, he had aspired higher. The wall was in
Doctor Scaevola's office. The culprit was the deformed
patient. Junior Wunier, no surprise to Porsena. Wunier had
a very defiant attitude.
Even though he promised never again to put up his
epigrams, Wunier was punished by having some of his
privileges suspended. He did not mind. For a brief time, he
became a hero to the other patients.
Jim's parents had not been able to make their final visit
on the day scheduled. Porsena would not allow Jim, who
was in no condition to handle a traumatic event, to see
them. The psychiatrist was pleasantly surprised when Eric
and Eva Grimson agreed to put off leaving for Texas until
they could talk to him. That was over with now and with
results that Porsena had not expected.
Some elements in Jim's stories puzzled and disturbed the
psychiatrist. These had caused him, though he felt slightly
foolish doing so, to research these elements. He had not told
Jim about it, nor did he intend to. Not for a long time and
perhaps never.
Jim's accounts of his adventures had faintly rung a bell in
Porsena's mind. They were like chimes drifting over the
horizon of a faery sea. To make certain that he had no
grounds for doubt or unease, he had phoned an acquain-
tance, Doctor Mary Brizzi. She was not only an English-
270
RED ORC'S RAGE
literature professor but an ardent reader of science fiction
and fantasy. He had given her the names of Lords, places,
and events recounted by Jim. He did not tell her that they
came from a patient.
"They're from William Blake's Didactic and Symbolical
Works," Brizzi said. "But they're also in some of the World
of Tiers series, as you know. However, Farmer also writes
of Lords who are not in Blake's works. Using his creative
imagination, I suppose. Farmer's description of the Lords'
family relationships also differs in some respects from
Blake's."
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (184 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

And Jim's differs in some respects from both of those
men, Porsena thought.
"Blake's city of Golgonooza and certain Lords, such as
Manathu Vorcyon, Ijim, and Zazel of the Cavemed World,
are not mentioned in Farmer's series. He also has not, so
far, anyway, written that Red Ore was once a man-serpent.
In Blake's works. Red Ore is transformed for a while into a
sort of snake-centaur. But not by Los, his father. I'll check
it for you, but I think it was another Lord, Urizen, who did
it. That part about Ore sweating jewels, that was in Blake,
too.
"There's an interesting interlude in the latest book in the
series. Kickaha sees, at a distance, an old man dressed in
strange garb, obviously not a Lord. I think that that old man
is William Blake, and his identity will be revealed in the
next novel, if there ever is any. Just how Blake, who died
in 1827, could show up alive in the pocket universes of the
Lords, I don't know. Maybe Farmer will explain it in the
next book. What, if I may inquire, is your interest in these
two myth-makers, since you're a psychiatrist?"
"They figure in a paper I'm working on," Doctor Porsena
said. "If the paper is published, I'll send you a copy."
After he hung up, the doctor sat for a long time. He told
277
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
RED ORC'S RAGE
himself: Take as a premise that parallel worlds and artificial
pocket universes were a reality. Premise that there really are
Lords. Premise also that Blake had somehow acquired some
knowledge of these. Jim's theory that Farmer had learned of
them through psychic "leaks" or "vibrations" in the walls
between those worlds and Earth's might have some
validity—if the premise was valid. Accept for a moment
that Blake had also gotten images or some kind of data
through these leaks. They had formed the bases from which
sprang his Didactic and Symbolical Works.
Blake, an acknowledged genius and perhaps a madman,
had mixed his knowledge of the Thoan worlds with Judaeo-
Christian theology and other subjects. The result was the
Works, a mishmash of truth and poetry and mysticism and
allegory.
But how could Farmer, an American writer born ninety-
one years after Blake's death, have also tuned in, as it were,
to much the same data? There were certain similarities in
the lives of Blake, Farmer, and Crimson. All three had had
vivid visions or strong hallucinations. Blake and Grimson
had first experienced them when very young. Fanner had
had them when he was an adult. He claimed to have seen
ghosts on two occasions and to have had two mystical
experiences. None of the three had been on drugs when
these happened.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (185 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
Did this tenuous connection among the three mean
anything? Were there parallel universes which all three had
somehow "contacted"?
No, no, no! He, Doctor Porsena, could not accept as
valid either the premises or the conclusions therefrom. The
most rational explanation was that Blake had originated his
wild poetry with no help from vibrations, transmissions, or
leaks. Fanner had based part of his series on Blake's works.
And Jim Grimson had read at least some of Blake's words.
272
But he did not remember having done so. After all, Jim
admitted several times that he often read while he was
stoned or drunk.
Yet . . . there were the whiplash cuts. But there was no
reason stigmata could not produce incisions in flesh.
There was his claim to be expert in flint-working and to
know certain data about advanced chemistry. These could
be tested.
Also, he claimed to be fluent in Thoan. That could be
checked. No eighteen-year-old ignorant of linguistics could
make up a language that would be self-consistent in syntax
and vocabulary and pronunciation. Nor would he have a
Lord word stock.
There was one disturbing fact. Porsena's keen ear had
noticed that, when Jim had rattled off those Thoan phrases,
he had pronounced the "r" in Ore in a most un-English
manner. It had sounded to Porsena like a Japanese "r,"
though not quite that. And his "t" when followed by a
vowel had not been aspirated. That is, the little puff of air
following the consonants had been missing. That was not
Jim's native pronunciation.
The doctor did not believe that Jim was faking anything.
Jim really believed his stories. However, the human mind
was capable of very strange and, indeed, unbelievable feats.
If anyone should know that, a psychiatrist should.
If the tests were to be done, they would be carried out
discreetly. It would not be good for any psychiatrist's
professional reputation if his colleagues thought that he was
taking Jim's claims seriously. But if it did become known
that such tests were being conducted, some kind of satis-
factory explanation could be offered for doing them. Such
as a study of the psychological bases for the patient's
delusions, their history, and so forth. That was legitimate.
For the time being, such a project would be in abeyance.
273

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
What he had to concentrate on now was seeing that the
patient was "cured" or in remission.
Winnie's voice came over the intercom then.
"Mister Grimson is here. Doctor."
"Send him in, please."
Jim entered the room and sat down after greeting the
psychiatrist. On the whole, he looked healthy and confi-
dent. The dark rings around his eyes were gone. He was
smiling. But Porsena knew that Jim could put up a convinc-
ing front. On the other hand, he might not be frightened. He
might even be eager to live with the Wyzaks and have a
near-normal life. His true attitude would be revealed during
the session.
"I still can't get over it!" Jim burst out. "Who'd've
dreamed that my father'd suddenly be sorry for what he's
done to me? I never imagined, no way, that he'd cry like a
baby and get down on his knees and beg me to forgive him!
I still can't believe that he really means it! Next time, he'll
be the same old son of a bitch he's always been!
"And I was overcome by emotion! I actually forgave
him, and I meant it! Then! But I still hold a lot of things
against him!"
"I've not treated your father. Thus, I have only a
superficial knowledge of his character and his motives. But
my own experience and reading of case histories convince
me that such reversals of behavior do occasionally occur."
He was thinking that Eric's remorse and plea for forgive-
ness had a parallel in Blake's Works. Doctor Brizzi had told
him that Los and Enitharmon had repented of their ill
treatment of their son. They, like Eric, had hastened to
make amends as best they could.
Brizzi had been puzzled by Porsena's questions about
Red Ore castrating his father and eating the testicles.
274
RED ORC'S RAGE
"There's nothing like that in Blake. Nor in Farmer. Where
did you run across a reference to that?"
"It has to do with a fantasy of a patient of mine," Porsena
said-
"Oh? Well, anyway, Los's testicles would have regener-
ated, grown back out, according to what Farmer says of the
Lords' biological capabilities. Is your patient into Blake's or
Farmer's works?"
"Somewhat," Porsena said. "That's really all I may tell
you about him."
It seemed to him that the castration and cannibalism
sprang wholly from Jim's wish-fantasies. Neither Blake nor
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (187 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

Fanner was responsible for that. And it was, of course, a
coincidence that both Jim's father in reality and Ore's
parents in Blake should have apologized to their sons.
The doctor said, "I'm sorry, Jim. I was thinking about
something. You're sticking to your determination to stay
with the Wyzaks? You haven't reconsidered your parents'
offer to let you live with them once they're on their financial
feet?"
"No way. I'm staying here even after the therapy is
complete. My father may be sincere, for now, but I'm afraid
that things'll fall into the same old sordid groove after a
while. I will go see them for a while someday. Not now, not
soon."
In their conversation after that, Porsena stressed the
difficulties and dangers the outpatient would run into.
"Mrs. Wyzak should be a stabilizing influence on you.
From what you've told me, she's a strong disciplinarian.
You need someone like her. But she may regard you as an
adopted son, one who'll replace her dead son. She could try
to smother you with love and be less strict than she was with
Sam. Spoil you, in other words, because she'll be afraid of
losing you, too.
275
PHILIP JOSE FARMER                                                   RED ORC'S RAGE
"There's also the possibility that you'll identify her as
your mother. You'll have to be careful about that. She is not
your mother, whom you've blamed for not protecting you
against your father. She's Mrs. Wyzak, a big-hearted
woman who's taking you into her home. Keep all this in
mind, and report to me how it's going there."
"I will," Jim said. "I believe I can make it."
They discussed Jim's "shedding" procedure, which had
already started. Jim was using the technique some others
had adopted. As therapy progressed, he would tear the
covers off the first book in the series, then rip off pages until
all were gone. After that, he would start on the second book
and work through to the last one. But he would go a step
further than the other patients. He would put the tom-out
pages into a shredder.
Jim and the psychiatrist had agreed that he would not
reread any of the series. According to Jim, Porsena did not
have to worry about that. He had found it hard enough to
just look at the covers without being afraid of another
flashback.
"I don't ever want to go back into that evil son of a
bitch!" Jim said.
Then they talked about the means the patients used to
enter the worlds. Many of them thought that the mantras
and chants were magical tools. Part of the therapy was
convincing the patients, in the latter stages of therapy, that
the means were psychological, not magical.
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (188 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

"There is no such thing as magic," Porsena said. "But if
the patient wishes to act as if the entry methods are magical,
we don't discourage that. Whatever works is OK with us.
But we don't want the patients either in remission or cured
to still believe that there is such a thing as magic when they
are through with the therapy. Please don't tell this to any
patient who hasn't progressed as yet to your stage."
276
When the time came for Jim to leave, he stood up, and
they shook hands.
"I'm not really leaving you since I'll be seeing you once
or twice a week," Jim said. "But this is kind of a farewell."
He walked to the door, then turned around before he
opened it.
"I encountered many mysteries in the Lords' worlds," he
said. "Most of these I solved or at least had a good
explanation for. But I haven't penetrated The Mystery."
"Which is what?" Porsena said.
"If all universes except for one, the original, were created
by the Lords, who created the original? And why?"
"Only the young concern themselves seriously with
matters such as ultimate origins and the reasons for them.
When you get old enough to know that such questions have
no answers, you'll quit asking."
"I hope I never get that old," Jim said.
Porsena smiled. He supposed that the smile looked to Jim
like The Sphinx's inscrutable expression. Perhaps Jim
thought that his doctor was concealing the wisdom of the
ages behind the smirk of the stone-headed Egyptian statue.
He was. He knew what The Sphinx knew about the
ultimate mysteries. That is, nothing.
The Mysteries were unassailable in this world and in all
worlds.
The most that any human being could do was to try to
solve the "little" mysteries. Those were huge enough.

AFTERWORD
A. James Giannini, M.D.
On an otherwise unremarkable English afternoon, a remark-
able English girl named Alice walked through a looking
glass. On the other side, she found a land of fantasy and
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (189 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
distortion. Her ability was unusual because she could enter
a fantasy created by someone else and then return to the
alternative "real" world. Schizophrenics and other psychot-
ics inhabit their own world of delusion and also have
difficulty reentering the real world—that common interface
that humanity shares. Children can also inhabit a secret
place of fantasy. While they seldom have trouble skipping
across the twin planes of fantasy and reality, they do not
have the ability to transport adults into their secret worlds.
It is the lack of Alice's gift that makes the practice of
psychiatry so difficult. Each delusional patient is truly a
master of his own universe. This universe is an entity
unique to the individual. It has its own terrain, its own
memory-base and its own symbolic language. The under-
standing of each of these worlds provides the therapist with
the ability to discover the root trauma and modify the
results. Unfortunately, the patient retains the ability and
prerogative to alter his personal reality at any time. For
some, alterations occur in a chaotic fashion, while for
others it seems to occur whenever a breakthrough is
imminent.
The great English therapist, R. D. Laing, developed a
school of thought in which a schizophrenic's psychosis
would be considered an alternative valid reality. For the
initial therapeutic phase, as least, this school provided a
useful model. In trying to understand the patient's psycho-
sis, however, one had to consume a large amount of
professional resources. Many times, this expenditure was
wasted. The patient was sole master of his delusional
scheme; he controlled its access and could alter its form.
Frustration with these inherent limitations causes many
psychiatrists to rely solely on a specific class of medication,
the "neuroleptics," to reduce and control their patient's
psychoses. This has always seemed to me a solution to
one-half of the physician's classic problem. Dependence
upon neuroleptics alone resolves the symptoms but does not
remove the cause of the disorder. With the resolution of the
delusional symptoms may come the disappearance of the
very key that might provide insight into the damage that
begat the delusion.
Alice was able to pass unhindered through an alternative
universe. This was a universe of some stability. While such
characters as the Duchess' child could change their shape,
the underlying form of the chessboard-mirror world was
stable. It is the accessibility and stability of this world that
makes it an attractive alternative to the locked-off morass of
each patient's separate delusional subreality. A therapeutic
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
anodyne would then be a world with fixed reference points
and a door that permits universal ingress and egress.
While completing my psychiatric residency at Yale Uni-
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (190 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,%20Philip%20Jose%20-%20World%20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt
versity, I encountered many patients whose worlds were
closed off to me. Their personal fears and my neuroleptic
medications seemed to function as twin seals forever
removing me from the dreadful fears that pushed them away
from reality. It was at Yale that I conceived using science
fiction or fantasy novels as the source of an alternative
reality that the patient and I could explore together.
Providentially, I discovered Philip Jose Fanner's World
of Tiers series. It seemed to be a tool designed for the
purpose of investigating and resolving psychotic distur-
bances. Its "Gates" provide the access mechanisms. Its
characters were a Jungian delight; an entire panoply of
archetypes were available for retrospective analysis. The
variety of pocket universes presented a large but fixed
number of multiple realities.
In the initial approaches with "Tiers-therapy," several
patients with psychotic presentation were asked to read the
series. Therapy then shifted from a review of the patients'
activities to a discussion of the books. Gradually, these
discussions became more focused so that the patient would
gradually relate his experiences with those of Tiers charac-
ters. When stress would occur between therapy sessions and
the patient would break down, the psychotic perceptions
would gradually incorporate an ever-expanding fraction of
the Tiers system. As an adapted Tiers universe replaced the
highly idiosyncratic forms of alternative reality, I was able
to enter each patient's private world. Finally, the metaphor-
ical means were available to conduct work on-site. It was as
if I were an astronomer, who, after gazing at Mars through
a distorted mirror, was finally able to walk on that planet's

red sands. Once the patient and I met on a common world,
meaningful therapy proceeded quickly.
In this form of therapy, I noted that adolescents and
younger adults had the best results. Those who were
possessed of a love for books were the most eager. Therapy
was quickly engaged if these young men and women felt
themselves to be misfits who belonged in another age.
Some had psychoses; others were addicted to their own
fantasy world. When I moved to Ohio, I found a corps of
willing patients (and supportive parents) who quickly ac-
cepted the tenets of Tiersian therapy. Since these patients
were comfortable with expressing themselves, I was able to
utilize the powerful tool of group therapy to project our-
selves into a Tiersian model.
In standard group therapy, what is discussed ("content")
is less important than the act of discussion ("process"). It is
after all the flow of water rather than the nature of water that
gives a river its special properties and attractions. Since
every patient had a unique way of relating to the Tiers
worlds, the de-emphasis on content worked well. Because
all of our group members now shared the same basic
symbols and archetypes, each patient could relate to another
in a way that enhanced the process. By relating to each
file:///F|/rah/Philip%20Jose%20Farmer/Farmer,...20of%20Tiers%206%20-%20Red%20Orc's%20Rage.txt (191 of 192) [1/19/03 7:27:34 PM]

other, the group was able to resolve the earlier conflicts of
its members and gradually reenter the real world. Using the
Tiers series as a halfway house, they moved from private
reality to shared reality to that reality which all humanity
holds in common.
Farmer's re-creation of Tiersian therapy at Wellington
Hospital captures the essence of this particular process.
Tiersian therapy is currently undergoing a punctuated evo-
lution. It has been discontinued and continued many times.
281
PHILIP JOSE FARMER
Each manifestation has brought with it many refinements.
As the strangely familiar Dr. Porsena emphasizes, the trick
of the game is to ensure that Tiersian therapy becomes an
entry into reality, not a substitute for it. Generally, our
patients were able to distinguish their delusions or fantasies
from reality; they simply chose to avoid reality. Tiersian
therapy is not yet applicable for the profoundly psychotic
individual. Schizophrenics are not candidates for therapeu-
tic systems that utilize evolving realities.
In reading the fictional re-creation of group process and
the individual reaction to it, I felt I was an observer in my
own therapeutic groups. Though Philip Farmer has never
observed any of these sessions, he has reconstructed them
accurately. While all persons and processes are totally
fictional, any of my former patients and cotherapists should
feel a sense of familiarity.
Future scientific papers on Tiersian therapy will analyze
the components of this technique. It is to be hoped that my
professional colleagues will then attempt to replicate the
methods and results of this approach. Scientific papers,
while a necessary part of the transmission of knowledge,
lack the gestalt of the exploration: the experiment, the
analysis, the therapeutic techniques. The novel, however,
while short on absolutely accurate detail faithfully repro-
duces the sweat and fire of scientific enquiry. Red Ore's
Rage carries on its pages the intuitive "feel" of psychother-
apeutic treatment. In it, we can truly experience Jim's
emergence into reality as he takes control of his own life.
