The concept of a “smart city” is used widely in general; however, it is hard 
to explain because of the complexity and multidimensionality of this notion. 
However, the essential qualification for being a smart city is to achieve 
“sustainable social, environmental, and economic development” and boost 
the living standards of society based on Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) and Artificial intelligence (AI). AI in smart cities has 
become an important aspect for cities that face great challenges to make 
smart decisions for social well-being, particularly cybersecurity and cor-
porate sustainability. In this context, we aim to contribute literature with 
a value-added approach where various AI applications of smart cities are 
discussed from a different perspective. First, we start by discussing the con-
ceptual design, modeling, and determination of components for the sustain-
ability of a smart city structure. Since smart cities operate on spatial-based 
data, it is important to design, operate, and manage smart city elements 
using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technologies. Second, we 
define the structure, type, unit, and functionality of the layers to be placed 
on the GIS to achieve best practices based on Industry 4.0 components. 
Transportation is one of the key indicators of smart cities, so it is critical to 
make transportation in smart cities accessible for different disabled groups 
by using AI technologies. Third, we demonstrate what kinds of technolo-
gies should be used for which disabled groups in different transportation 
vehicles with specific examples. Finally, we create a discussion platform for 
processes and sub-processes such as waste management, emergency man-
agement, risk management, and data management for establishing smart 
cities including the financial and ethical aspects.

Foreword
As the first quarter of the twenty-first century draws to a close, many gov-
ernments' urban strategy agendas necessarily include discussion of and 
planning for the “smart city” phenomenon. This is particularly the case in 
developed countries, where rapid growth in urban areas requires contending 
with complex infrastructural, environmental, and social problems. Smart 
cities are being piloted as citizens around the world demand that local gov-
ernments design urban spaces that improve their quality of life.
Creating smart cities is a complex challenge, one that demands contend-
ing with many discrete areas of focus, from the physical capital of the city to 
its intellectual and social capital. Urban planning is not only a matter of 
urban design but also incorporates social science, political science, and eco-
nomics. Importantly, smart city creation is supported by technology driven 
by advances and innovation in computer science and engineering that stimu-
late sustainable socio-economic development. The capacity to innovate itself 
is shaped by a host of factors, such as the development and adoption of 
information and communication technologies (ICT), living standards, resi-
dents' readiness, and willingness to invest. Higher rates of urbanization and 
large “mega-cities” with 10 million or more residents make the task of creat-
ing sustainable and affordable environments with a high quality of life a 
pressing need, but one with even more difficulties.
Smart cities and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) have been among the 
key topics centered in urban policy discussions. Yet, attempts to use AI to 
increase efficiency in cities have foundered, failing to succeed in producing 
smart cities. This is mostly attributable to largely myopic, reductionist, tech-
nologically deterministic AI approaches applied to complex urbanization 
problems that belie simplistic solutions. Thus, while the use of smart city 
technologies has the promise of revolutionizing urban life, private sector 
actors that supply and develop these systems for public sector need to con-
sider these unique factors.
This book provides readers with the conceptual and practical knowledge 
base to grasp and apply the fundamental principles required in the planning, 
design, and operations of smart cities. Each chapter of the book examines an 
interesting topic in terms of promoting smart city networks of the future.

1.1  INTRODUCTION
The areas that are most affected and focused by the rapid change and 
­digital transformation in the world are the cities that affect the living 
conditions of societies with high levels of welfare. For this reason, it is 
possible to obtain information about the level of development depending 
on how cities are managed and structured. Being aware of this situation, 
­technology-producing companies make important projects and invest-
ments to implement innovations and technological products in cities and 
connected urban living spaces.
In this study, our aim is to reveal the innovative projects and investments 
made within the scope of smart cities and urbanization in the world and 
especially the studies on the AI application areas where these are made func-
tional. Thus, by providing technical information about the current situation 
of smart cities and urbanization, it will be possible to present predictions 
and policy recommendations for the future. In this way, it is our main goal 
to contribute to humanity and science.
It is a fact that there are many works in the literature on smart cities. The 
distinguishing aspect of this study is to reflect the artificial intelligence (AI) 
point of view and to reveal the necessary elements in smart city design as a 
whole. Therefore, this book has been prepared by working with an interdis-
ciplinary team to which the chapter authors of the book contribute based on 

In this work, the content has been prepared with a modular and interdis-
ciplinary structure that evaluates the concept of smart city from different 
perspectives based on AI applications. Hence, the study is designed with the 
aim of presenting the big picture based on the complementary content and 

2  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
the theme of smart cities in the axis of different usage areas of AI in each 
chapter. Accordingly, the book is organized as follows.
In Chapter 1, we made an introduction of all chapters and summarized 
the aim of this book. The introduction part contains brief and concise infor-
mation, especially for the purpose of clearly stating the aims of our study 
and providing a correct orientation to the readers.
In Chapter 2, a general introduction to the topic of smart cities is given. 
In this context, conceptual design information for a typical smart city is 
presented. It also explains the key components of smart cities. According to 
Batty et al. (2012), the idea of “smart city” is defined based on the key con-
cepts such as quality, ability, intelligence level, and social adaptation. 
European Parliament (EP) (2014) states that smart cities are the cities with 
undertakings that relate at least to one or more of the following concepts 
such as “smart management”, “smart people”, “smart life”, “smart trans-
portation”, “smart economy”, and “smart environment”. In this respect, 
smart cities are commonly defined by information communication technolo-
gies, resource optimization, governance capability, economic development, 
urban infrastructure, and interconnectedness. In addition, smart city design 
alternatives are discussed.
In Chapter 3, why smart cities are transforming from digital to sustain-
able urban systems is discussed. In this context, future expectations are 
revealed by establishing a connection between the concept of smart city and 
the concept of sustainability. Thus, the “Eco-Urban Approach” is achieved. 
The essential way to achieve this is to create a smart city strategy. From this 
point of view, in this section, the strategy that smart cities should have is 
explained in detail. The positive and negative aspects of different approaches 
are also briefly discussed. The most important finding from this chapter is 
that to become a smart city, it is important to give priority to the field of 
sustainability and prepare the smart city strategy accordingly.
In Chapter 4, Geographic Information System (GIS)-based management 
of smart cities is discussed in detail. AI approaches that are frequently pre-
ferred in GIS applications used in the management of smart cities are 
explained. The use of AI methods together with advanced technologies for 
the benefit of society in the spatial modeling, analysis and visualization of 
phenomena is also explained. In this respect, the depths of space and the 
cyber world can be defined as “spatial intelligence” or “geospatial intelli-
gence” which is essential for smart city applications (Dangermond and 
Goodchild, 2020).
In Chapter 5, the main topic defined as the connection between Industry 
4.0 and smart city concepts is explained and application areas are empha-
sized. In this respect after explaining the basic issues related to industry 4.0, 
these topics are linked with smart cities. Examples of how smart cities can 
be developed with industry 4.0 applications are given in detail based on 
relevant literature. The factors affecting this situation are explained and 
their importance is emphasized. In order to reach this stage, it is stated that 

AI perspective for smart cities  3
some technical, managerial, economic, and social problems must be solved 
(Becic, 2020). The creation of the smart cities of the future can be put for-
ward based on a governance approach based on the cooperation of many 
actors, primarily the informatics sector, the state, local governments, and the 
city’s stakeholders. Therefore, this situation requires the correct definition of 
cooperation areas. In addition, while developing smart city policies, it is 
recommended to consider many factors such as technological problems, 
data security, confidentiality of private data, high costs, qualified manpower, 
and the level of technology adoption by service users and stakeholders 
(Batty et al., 2012).
In Chapter 6, one of the important features of smart cities is what kind of 
opportunities and facilitating environments they provide to the disabled. In 
this chapter, information about the services that can be provided for the 
disabled in transportation applications in smart cities is presented. First of 
all, traditional transportation activities and advanced transportation activi-
ties are explained, and the differences are revealed. In the framework of 
intelligent transportation techniques, it is stated in which areas AI can be 
used. Suggestions for the establishment of smart transportation systems and 
the transition process are presented. In addition, examples are given of 
places where disabled people need the most and try to reach in the city.
In Chapter 7, the conceptual framework for smart waste management 
(SWM) models is presented. In this context, it is explained how smart cities 
should established SWM systems. Research has been conducted on impor-
tant studies in the literature on SWM via web of science. Waste management 
models based on AI applications and various techniques are introduced. The 
purpose of the systematic literature review is to identify the main problems 
and solutions in the literature while reviewing the research on waste man-
agement in smart cities. Thus, it is aimed to research and visualize the issues 
discussed in SWM and to guide future research in this field. This research is 
aimed to contribute to the literature both by identifying the gaps in the lit-
erature that are expected to guide future SWM studies and by revealing the 
current situation. The methodology covers the systematic review of the lit-
erature used, including research questions, search criteria, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, and information extraction strategy. While introducing 
the technology necessary for SWM, the issues about which awareness should 
be raised are also discussed.
In Chapter 8, intelligent emergency management in smart cities is 
expressed as a basic requirement. The conceptual framework and impor-
tance of smart emergency service activities are explained. Recommendations 
are presented for the establishment of smart emergency service systems 
based on AI in smart cities. In this context, technological elements, infra-
structure, and modeling approaches are explained from the perspective of 
AI. The basic problems encountered during the installation process of smart 
emergency service systems and what needs to be done are explained. 
Prospects and recent developments based on the literature are highlighted.

4  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
In Chapter 9, financing models that are needed to provide the necessary 
funding for the formation of smart cities are described. Determining and 
applying the right financing models can be expressed as a basic need for 
sustainable smart city investments. In this chapter, traditional and advanced 
financing models, and the advantages of applying advanced financing mod-
els are explained. The latest developments and new approaches in the world 
are revealed and suggestions are presented. Data monetizing, an IoT and 
AI-based financing method, is discussed which supports the financing of the 
investments by the income obtained from the sale of data to third parties. In 
addition, crowdfunding is defined as an instrument based on public funding 
through online platforms. Online crowdfunding platforms can receive sup-
port from AI technologies in the processes of launching campaigns, predict-
ing donor behavior, displaying targeted ads, creating content, and verifying 
the identities of the campaigners. In addition, the use of blockchain technol-
ogy and cryptocurrencies on these platforms is presented as making funding 
processes safer and more transparent. A striking case of the use of AI in 
finance is asset tokenization, that is, the process of digitizing assets on the 
blockchain. Tokenized securities, which are blockchain-embedded represen-
tations of real-world securities, can be effectively used to finance smart city 
infrastructure projects.
In Chapter 10, it is aimed to emphasize the importance of the usage of AI 
for reducing and/or eliminating possible disaster losses associated with 
disaster risk management (DRM) processes. In addition, this chapter focuses 
on the role of disaster risk reduction (DRR) as an important tool in the 
decision-making support system. This chapter extends the horizon in terms 
of the role of risk management in AI applications, the advantages, and dis-
advantages of the usage of AI in the DRR process, the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICT) for reducing disaster risk in sus-
tainable urban systems and also application examples. The effectiveness of 
public stakeholders in DRR process is discussed based on relevant literature. 
DRR policy recommendations are made for regional, national, and interna-
tional needs and expectations.
In Chapter 11, a conceptual framework is presented for the correct under-
standing of the concept of data ethics and AI and the evolution process of AI 
standards in the process from the past to the present. It highlights the oppor-
tunities and threats that arise by explaining the main ethical issues in the 
application of AI, especially in the design of smart cities. There are many 
different parties and stakeholders involved in the management of smart cit-
ies. In this context, the importance of developing common approaches to 
emerging ethical problems is explained. The importance of determining the 
role and applications of AI in smart cities according to ethical standards is 
explained and how future expectations will develop is expressed based on 
the literature. Information on the accuracy of the data required for AI appli-
cations and the legal regulations regarding the level of compliance with ethi-
cal standards are presented. In addition, various examples are given by 

AI perspective for smart cities  5
presenting detailed information about social and ethical problems. 
Algorithms, which are an important element of AI applications, and the 
risks and ethical problems for algorithms are evaluated. In this context, by 
specifying the responsibilities of individuals and states, solutions to the main 
problems that may arise in the future are recommended.
In Chapter 12, the scope of data and information security in smart cities 
is defined and the key terms, definitions, and concepts that stand out in this 
context are explained. The issue of security in smart cities is discussed from 
the perspective of the generally accepted IoT (Internet of Things). The secu-
rity needs of smart cities and what needs to be done in their design are stated 
in detail. Data security is emphasized as a basic requirement for the sustain-
ability of smart city applications. Based on the literature, security measures 
in the face of problems that may arise in smart cities are discussed and pol-
icy recommendations are made.

2.1  INTRODUCTION
Smart city is a possible concept that can be hypothetically put forward as 
a target for all cities. However, in order to define a city as a smart city, a 
specific vision for that city should be revealed and a determined road map in 
line with this vision should be progressed. In this direction, it is necessary to 
define first what the concept of smart city means for that city. Many profes-
sionals make various definitions on the concept of smart city. It is important 
that cities agree to use a proper description, as this arranges the coverage 
and focus of a complex transformation journey. For instance, according to 
one definition, smart cities are systems that use information and commu-
nication technologies (ICT) to be smarter and more efficient in the use of

standard of living, logrolling innovation and a low carbon economy.
In another definition, the concept of “Smart City” means opening new 
horizons in science, industry and commerce by using ICT, leading the trans-
formation in the public sector, using information technologies effectively in 
the fields of management, trade and communication, and multi-participa-
tion oriented “e-governance” concept. It can also be defined as a system that 
provides smart physical spaces and infrastructures (Odendaal, 2003). The 
concept of “smart” in a smart city usually emphasizes quality, ability, intel-
ligence level and social adaptation (Batty et al., 2012). The Smart Cities 
Council defines the community lands that use ICT to procure the livability 
and sustainability of the city as smart cities. Su et al. (2011) define smart 
cities as comprehensive digital cities and state that they relate to visual and 
measurable urban management and operations. Giffinger et al. (2007) 
emphasize on raising intelligent combinations of assets and activities of 
independent and conscious citizens who perform well in the economy, 
­people, governance, mobility, environment and life.
Another study defines smart cities as secure settlements that monitor and 
combine all the conditions of the city’s critical infrastructures such as inter-
connected and efficient city management, education, health, public security, 
real estate, transportation and public services, and better organize their 
resources (Washburn and Sindhu, 2010). The British Standards Institute 
(BSI) defines smart cities as settlements consisting of digital and human sys-
tems that are effectively integrated to offer their citizens a sustainable, pros-
perous and participatory future. Smart cities are emphasized as settlements 
that bring together areas that impress the development of cities such as 
economy, people, governance, mobility, environment and quality of life and 
try to be more livable and competitive with the use of new technologies, the 
development of innovations and management knowledge (UCLG, 2018).
According to the European Parliament (EP), smart cities are defined as 
cities with initiatives that address at least one or more of the following top-
ics: smart management, smart people, smart life, smart transportation, smart 
economy and smart environment. Smart cities are mostly defined by infor-
mation communication technologies, resource optimization, governance 
capability, economic development, urban infrastructure and interconnected-
ness. On the other hand, Cohen’s “Smart Cities Wheel (SCW)” approach 
comes to the forefront in studies on smart cities. Smart mobility is explained 
by six components: governance, life, environment, economy, mobility, and 
people. Although the EP defines cities with initiatives that address one or 
more of the components coming from its own definition, as smart cities, the 
components complete the city system when they follow and integrate each 
other.
In a nutshell, smart cities, which integrate the city’s infrastructures such as 
education, health, public security, transportation and public services with 
ICT and effectively use-manage them, use limited resources efficiently, are

environmentally friendly and sustainable, and contribute to economic and 
social welfare. It can be defined as cities with active governance and public 
participation (Erdoğan, 2019). When we take a brief look at these defini-
tions, it can be said that the concept of smart city does not only consist of 
technological infrastructure, but also ecological principles should be taken 
into account, that is, the concepts of technology and ecology should be com-
bined. In the eco-tech city approach, which is the basis of more sustainable 
urban designs, we act together with technology that increases ecological 
awareness with a nature-first design approach and takes into account the 
local climate and green space structure. Only in this way can the smart and 
sustainable city concept be developed together.
As an example, survey activities were carried out with the “Talk London 
Initiative” to ensure that the citizens are included in the planning process. 
The “Croydon Technology Center” was established for innovative studies. 
With the London infrastructure application, the urban development process 
is controlled and monitored. With the “London Data Store”, it is aimed to 
quickly identify the needs of the city with the maximum efficiency of big 
data. In Singapore, with the green building initiative, all buildings in the 
country will be developed using smart system technologies by 2030. Thanks 
to the open data platform, the efficiency of big data in cloud computing will 
be increased. With the application to be used in public transportation, the 
occupancy-emptiness ratios and terminal times of public transportation can 
be obtained instantly. Likewise, the wireless discharge system in public 
transportation provides time-saving in urban transportation. Thanks to the 
autonomous vehicle initiative in the energy category, energy efficiency will 
be achieved by using intelligently equipped road systems.
Unconscious use will be prevented by monitoring the water consumption 
with smart meter trials. It has been integrated into simulation programs 
using the large-scale city model with the Virtual Singapore application. In 
order to increase the quality of life, assistive robot technologies have been 
started to be used in health services. In San Francisco, 52% of carbon emis-
sions come from buildings. In order to reduce carbon emissions and reduce 
costs, the project processes energy use and greenhouse gas emissions data 
into a dynamic, interactive 3D model of downtown San Francisco. This 
platform, which leverages 5D data visualization technology, serves as a col-
laboration tool for the city’s major government agencies, private commer-
cial building owners, academic institutions, energy management solutions 
providers, standards bodies, network and telecommunications companies, 
and energy renewal finance firms.
After the definition of the smart city is made correctly, a stakeholder 
group meeting should be held to generate a specific smart city foresight. It is 
necessary to bring together political leaders, community leaders, big compa-
nies, public-service corporation, entrepreneurs and SMEs, and universities, 
in order for a city to concur on a joint vision of a “Smart City”. The aim of 
these stakeholders is to guide the design of a roadmap of individual projects 

10  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
to develop the city and to agree on an inclusive and specific vision. Crafting 
a more in-depth vision is a task that cities must undertake, whereas their 
unique character, strengths and weaknesses.
A holistic approach to smart cities needs to recognize and understand the 
highly complicated context a city represents the rich terrestrial environment, 
the economy, transportation, public services and personal activities. For the 
conceptual design of smart cities, it is significant to create a consensus-based 
view of the future of a city, underlining the requirement to concentrate on 
the conversations, and relationships between people, communities, busi-
nesses and societies. This process often requires a creative ability jointly by 
city stakeholders. Thus, it would be appropriate to create a blueprint that 
can present the determined vision. To realize the vision of a smart city 
requires a roadmap of specific projects and interventions, within both short-
term and long-term strategic programs.
Although these projects and interventions come in different forms, those 
whose priority can be completed in the easiest and fastest way, that is, within 
the scope of a single organization; or it may be helpful to concentrate on 
these, as they build on inter-organizational initiatives already underway 
within cities. For example, optimizing infrastructures such as energy, water 
and transportation with implementing “Smart techniques” which environ-
ments such as industrial park, transport network, educational sites or enter-
tainment complexes. These taking advantages of the technology platforms 
conceive by the transition from cost-oriented transition to shared services in 
the government sector.
After a roadmap that can offer a vision for being a smart city has been put 
forward, the most important issue is to evaluate the feasibility of these activ-
ities and then to find the necessary financing for them. There are many ways 
to do this and a few of them are listed below:
	•	 Apply for research grants to support new smart city ideas;
	•	 Leveraging the knowledge-sharing potential of shared service 
platforms;
	•	 Finding and supporting hidden local innovations;
	•	 Exploring the cost-saving potential of smart technologies;
	•	 Finding sponsors for some smart city initiatives;
	•	 Taking initiatives to obtain loans from mutual funds to value-oriented 
banks;
	•	 Using legitimate state aid;
	•	 Promote open data; and
	•	 Creating new markets.
Smart cities are cities that provide infrastructures that can be used in a 
perpetual process of reinvention and creativity. New technology platforms 
created to support smart city initiatives must be made available to com-
munities and entrepreneurs to continually innovate in their local context. A 

Conceptual design  11
smart city provides the perpetual creation of new products and services that 
allow habitants and visitants to make choices that enrich local values and 
togetherness.
2.2  COMPONENTS OF SMART CITIES
It is also possible to discuss the innovations related to the concept under 
three headings. These are technological innovations (innovations) to 
improve techniques and create conditions for better use of tools; manage-
rial and organizational innovations that need to be introduced to ensure 
effective use of technological tools and conditions. It can be categorized 
as innovations that address institutional and non-technical urban problems 
and introduce policies that create the conditions for a smart city. These inno-
vations and innovative perspectives should of course be considered within 
the context of the changing context according to the characteristics of the 
cities. Otherwise, practices that are incompatible with the structure of the 
city and unsustainable may emerge (Nam and Pardo, 2011).
Regarding the concept of “smart city”, it is possible to construct it in the 
axis of six main components within the framework of the fields of activity 
defined in the literature. The smart city is a forward-performing city within 
the framework of these six characteristics, built on the “intelligent” combi-
nation of assets and activities of distinctive, independent and self-aware citi-
zens. To define the smart city and its six components, it is necessary to 
develop a transparent and easy hierarchical structure in which the defini-
tions of each stage are defined by the results of another stage. In the smart 
city pyramid created within this systematic, there are six basic components 
(Figure 2.1) and 27 factors (Figure 2.2) obtained as a result of their elabora-
tion in the field of application (Giffinger et al., 2007).
Contribution of new smart cities to smart city vision: In addition to its 
advantages such as designing new forms of urban strategy using cutting-
edge technology, modern facilities and without being subject to the con-
straints that limit smart strategies in existing cities (Ratti and Townsend, 
2011), it requires serious investments and a suitable governance model, and 
Figure 2.1  Components of smart cities.
(Giffinger, 2007.)

12  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
it is important to equip new cities with technological solutions. It also has 
risks such as creating problems in terms of sustainability.
The most important component of sustainable smart urbanization is data. 
Especially with big data, the internet of things is an important factor in 
determining the feasibility of smart city initiatives (Hashem et al., 2016). In 
addition, the smart city is also an application of the internet of things 
(Macke et al., 2018). However, in order for the data to be evaluated using 
information technologies and to provide a tangible benefit to increase 
human efficiency and comfort, smart cities must keep up with the develop-
ments and changes required by the digital age. At this stage, it is necessary 
to instantly analyze and report a wide variety of data collected by the inter-
net of things, using the right techniques.
The collected data can be analyzed in different ways by different user 
groups and reports can be created. For example, strategic level reports can 
be created for the mayor and senior managers at the strategic level, and 
tactical level managerial reports can be created for the managers at the head 
of the department. For this reason, analyzing the data with different filtering 
and analysis methods ensures that the right report is delivered to the right 
person and effective decisions are taken quickly.
Sustainable smart urbanization: It is a process that is constantly advanc-
ing, innovative and has no end in terms of development. In order for this 
Figure 2.2  Main and subcomponent of smart cities.
(Giffinger, 2007.)

Conceptual design  13
process to be successful, there are basic factors that must be taken into 
account during the design phase. Chourabi et al. (2012) identified these fac-
tors by reducing them to eight key components: (1) management and orga-
nization, (2) technology, (3) governance, (4) political context, (5) people and 
communities, (6) economy, (7) infrastructure and (8) natural environment. 
The six basic components that make up smart cities provide an operational 
definition that removes the uncertainty about the concept (Caragliu et al., 
2011). Madakam and Ramaswamy (2014) listed the characteristics of six 
basic components as follows:
Sustainable smart economy: It refers to an economy that is compatible with 
an innovative approach and entrepreneurial spirit instead of a traditional 
economy based on natural and scarce resources. For this, there is a need 
for a sustainable smart person who is a lifelong learner, creative, open-
minded and participates in social life.
Sustainable smart governance: It is a management approach that has features 
such as accountability, rule of law, participation in the decision-making 
process and uses technology to facilitate these processes. While sustain-
able smart transportation aims for healthy, safe and innovative transpor-
tation for people, it is also sensitive to climate change and energy security. 
It aims for innovations such as parking systems, bicycle use, electric vehi-
cles, traffic monitoring systems and vehicle sharing services. Sustainable 
smart environment describes an environment that is heavily equipped 
with sensors, processors, communication and control tools. Sustainable 
smart living, on the other hand, enables the smart city components to be 
implemented with a holistic approach, with the home environment that 
adjusts itself according to the user’s wishes by constantly perceiving the 
environmental conditions, and the objects connected to the internet by 
perceiving both the preferences and the social context of the user.
2.3  BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF SUSTAINABLE SMART 
CITIES
In order for a city to be not only a smart city but also a sustainable smart 
city, it must have basic competence in issues such as reliability of infor-
mation and technology, technological life cycle, compatibility with existing 
platforms and security.
2.3.1  Reliability of information and technology
Reliability/resilience standards in traditional infrastructure investments 
are typically 99.997%. It is very difficult to reach these standards for 
new hardware and devices used in sustainable smart city applications. 

14  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
As the spatial size and population of the cities increase, the infrastruc-
ture investment that needs to be made should increase along with it. For 
example, with the increase in the number of sensors, the internet of things, 
which is the biggest data source in smart cities, increases their security 
vulnerabilities.
2.3.2 Technology lifecycle
Cities often lack the competencies needed to assess and understand technol-
ogy risks, the pace of technology change and the lifecycle. The rate of change 
in traditional infrastructure investments cannot be at the desired level. For 
example, the fact that 4G technology, which is one of the indispensable 
communication technologies in smart cities, will soon be replaced by 5G 
technology, and the current investment in 4G will be made in 5G.
2.3.3  Compatibility with existing platform
In order to take advantage of economies of scale and ease of use, software 
and hardware must be compatible with existing technologies being imple-
mented in the city. Achieving this requires a long-term common information 
structure and infrastructure vision. It is very important for a sustainable 
smart city to be interoperable with other systems on both a regional and 
national scale. Summarizing the data obtained from smart cities and send-
ing them to the upper systems, the data from the upper systems are also 
obtained, making it easier to make decisions in both stages.
2.3.4  Security
Most sustainable smart city technologies require collecting and transferring 
sensitive data over networks. For this reason, security-related issues must be 
resolved by cities and suppliers before implementing solutions.
Based on the requirements listed, it can be stated that a city must have the 
following in order to be considered a smart city (Xsights, 2017):
	•	 “Adequate amount of water and energy”,
	•	 “Effective solid waste management system”,
	•	 “A retainable information and communication systems”,
	•	 “An influential public transport and the mobile system of this public 
transport”,
	•	 “E-municipal services suitable for the era”,
	•	 “A successful, planned and programmed environmental management 
system”,
	•	 “Contemporary crisis and emergency response system etc. g b include 
parameters”.

2.4  SMART CITY DESIGN ALTERNATIVES
Although there is no common approach to the definition of smart city in 
the literature (Caragliu et al., 2011; Nam and Pardo, 2011), smart cities 
are characterized as a system consisting of five clusters: smart governance, 
smart economy, smart human capital indicators, smart life and smart envi-
ronment including important factors such as university, government, civil 
society and industry. In this context, smart governance (related to participa-
tion), smart human capital (related to people), smart environment (related 
to natural resources), smart living (related to the quality of life) and smart 
economy (related to competitiveness) are defined as clusters. Data sources 
based on literature review targeting medium-sized cities, including EU proj-
ects reports, urban audit dataset, European commission, European green 
city index, TISSUE, European thematic strategy on sustainable development 
of the urban environment and selected indicators from Europe’s smart cities 
ranking monitoring trends and indicators used and classified more than 60 
indicators into five clusters that define smart cities. As a result of the model 
he aimed to reveal in order to investigate the relationships between smart 
city components and actors, visions or the strategies in which smart cities 
act, four different city types were revealed:
	
1.	The entrepreneurial city
	
2.	The pioneer city
	
3.	The liveable city
	
4.	The connected city
Cities that have maximized their innovative and creative potential that can 
access emerging markets in current and future global and local competition 
and are the pioneers of globalization policy are defined as the entrepre-
neurial city. The pioneer city, which refers to the “melting pot” character 
of future urban areas, will also provide great opportunities for innova-
tive, smart and creative initiatives and will result in cultural diversity and 
fragmentation of lifestyles, smart environment and energy initiatives, and 
climate-neutral agents in the future space economy. The connected city, on 
the other hand, refers to the fact that cities cannot continue to be economic 
islands and fortresses and are interconnected from the local to the global, 
to seek development opportunities based on advanced transportation infra-
structures, smart logistics systems and accessible communication systems. 
The searcher is classified as the cities where it becomes a node or center in 
polycentric networks, including information and innovation networks.
Smart cities point to the existence of innovative technologies, network 
infrastructure and smart grids. ICT or engineering technologies are the real 
engines of smart applications (Cocchia, 2014). In this sense, it can be said 
that the first step and the most basic component of smart cities is the pres-
ence and use of ICT (Hollands, 2008; Harrison et al., 2010; Caragliu et al., 

16  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
2011; Batty, 2013; Angelidou, 2015). As a matter of fact, smart cities are 
derived from the idea of “information and communication technologies” 
(Batty et al., 2012). Angelidou (2015) stated in their studies that the use of 
ICT highlights social and environmental assets within the framework of 
competing cities, while Akdamar (2017) stated in their study that it is effec-
tive in connecting all information to better understand and control city 
operations and optimize the use of limited resources.
Urban information management, telecommunication applications, virtual 
reality applications, big data, fiber optic cables that change the urban infra-
structure and management applications that make the process of informa-
tion transfer full-time in connecting metropolitan networks together lead to 
more accurate and up-to-date information acquisition and more efficient 
use of data management and tools. It shows that the use of ICT is the most 
basic and most important element of the smart city definition. As a matter 
of fact, emphases such as benefiting from ICT in the definitions of smart cit-
ies (Hollands, 2008; Angelidou, 2015) and applying it to its infrastructure 
(Harrison et al., 2010; Caragliu et al., 2011; Batty, 2013) are also an indis-
pensable part of a city’s strategies to be smart. It reveals the prevalence and 
existence of ICTs.
The concept of smart city brings to mind the automation of everything in 
the space we live in. In the near future, we will have the opportunity to 
access and control all kinds of information about the city with our smart-
phones. Self-driving cars will be used in a wide variety of services, ranging 
from public transport to cargo delivery. The processing speed will increase 
gradually which is produced by routine and repetitive processes belonging 
to spatial. These huge datasets produced are not only about the long-term 
evolution of cities but also about detecting their short-term change. Most of 
the models identified in these short-term patterns can be predicted using 
machine learning techniques as they are routine patterns, but there are 
restrictions in reproducing them even for these routine patterns. Smart cities 
will make a lot of progress in the use of energy in artificial intelligence (AI), 
the delivery of location-based services, the automation of routine such as 
real-time public transport information to operators and passengers. It is 
obvious that there will be quite impressive developments in these areas in 
the next ten years and beyond. However, the key issue in the use of AI in 
urban planning is not for short term but long term, and here the fair chance 
for AI is more disputable.
2.5  CONCLUSION
Since the 19th century, urban planning has been working on trying to regu-
late the city which will improve everyone’s quality of life in terms of the 
city’s economy and social equality. In urban planning, it can be difficult to 
produce plans for the long-term improvement of the city. For this reason, 

Conceptual design  17
it is difficult to see AI change urban design techniques and decision-making 
in the planning process. The wide variety of determinants and associated 
uncertainties in urban planning cannot be automated by using an existing 
AI technology. But machine learning will be helpful in expanding our under-
standing of how the high-frequency and real-time city really works, but it is 
difficult to see how these tools will change planning and design in the short 
term. AI is likely to inform the planning process, as many types of technol-
ogy tools underlie urban planning. Any developed tools that show us how 
AI can be used for urban planning would be relevant in this context.
Instead, studies targeting more daily activities are included in the litera-
ture. For example, in China, the information on social media about the 
Shenzhen subway was analyzed by using text mining methods, and studies 
were carried out to determine the improvements and service areas about the 
subway service. AI study for another smart city application is about predict-
ing high-resolution temporal models of urban air pollution with machine 
learning techniques and determining the factors affecting it on a regional 
scale. In the study, a random forest algorithm was used to create spatio-
temporal variation models of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter 
and nitrogen dioxide using land-use regression models. In another study, the 
use of machine learning techniques in the planning stages of smart cities was 
discussed in the context of big data. In the study, changes in land prices, the 
hedonic pricing method and AI technologies were used in population 
estimation.

3.1  INTRODUCTION
The definitions of cities that have emerged in recent years have been chang-
ing in parallel with innovations and the development of Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Various solutions have been put 

20  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
forward to struggle with the problems arising from unsustainable urban 
planning processes. These solutions consist of new paradigms that purpose 
to design environmentally friendly physical areas and also more sustainable, 
durable and smarter and more livable cities (Yiğitcanlar and Han, 2010; 
Albino et al., 2015). These paradigms contain components in the spatial, 
social, economic, social, technological and institutional fields that meet the 
needs of urban dwellers, provide solutions to problems and include techno­
logical developments in urban areas. However, these solutions are limited 
to various technological interventions on smaller and local scale projects 
instead of large-scale implementation projects around the world (Yiğitcanlar 
et al., 2019). Local authorities are struggling to address sustainability issues 
and adequately provide basic conditions that serve the urban dwellers, such 
as accessible, safe, healthy built and natural environments, social equality, 
clean energy and affordable housing (Gilbert, 2016; Konys, 2018). To elim­
inate these problems, innovative urban services and efficient mechanisms 
have led to the search for smarter solutions through smart and sustainable 
infrastructures in urban areas.
While urban planning norms of the 21st century are examined, economic 
developments on different scales that economic and institutional interests 
are at the forefront are discussed (Lara et al., 2016). For characterizing and 
explaining the SC, various methods and concepts are used such as ICT, Big 
Data, open data, social capital, business and entrepreneurship, smart com­
munity and sustainability. Smart cities are presented as the object of differ­
entiating ICT management applications for data collection, transfer and 
analysis formats. These cities can be defined basically as the city types which 
are enterprise-driven technologically and deterministically (Kitchin, 2014). 
Moreover, as another definition, the SC refers to an optimized order and 
control society based on the coding of social life into software (Haggerty 
and Ericson, 2000).
It is important to examine intelligent development strategies specifically 
for urban settlements that are on the agenda of the urban planning disci­
pline. The integration of these strategies into the urban planning and design 
process is crucial as the examination of them. Since the beginning of the 
1990s, various approaches have been put forward in different contexts such 
as New Urbanism, Sustainable Cities, Ecological Cities, Green Cities, Smart 
Growth, Livable Cities and Digital Cities. It has been seen that these 
approaches have revealed diversified solutions for urban planning processes 
that have changed and developed over time. The SC approach among the 
planning approaches mentioned is reevaluated due to the framework of 
technological decency and ecological sensitivity in the face of the elements 
of specialized intensive consumption by increasing population (Sınmaz, 
2013).
ICTs have an increasing role in network-based urbanization. Therefore, 
ICTs have initiated irreversible changes which have a significant impact on 
human life, social well-being, the economy and the growth of cities. Smart 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  21
cities mark the development of human-centered digital policies, strategies 
and technological innovations that are used to strengthen the capacities of 
stakeholders in the urban planning management process. It can be said 
clearly that ICT has an increasing potential to achieve the desired results in 
urban development. Smart cities have been seen as a tool of sustainability 
that provides product and management of knowledge including definite 
issues such as the design of high-quality public areas, the establishment of 
an integrated network system, urban density, improving resource efficiency, 
reducing carbon emissions and improving the quality of life (Azmizam, 
2017). In addition, it is thought that the SC approach will be a key to real-
izing the Sustainable Development Goals (Fernandez-Anez et al., 2018; 
Gürsoy, 2019).
It can be said that rational solutions have started to be produced for the 
problems experienced in urban areas as a result of the rapid change and 
transformation in ICT. The technology-oriented investments are increasing 
in urban areas and cities are an application area for new technologies while 
the urban infrastructures are being considered after the millennium. From 
this point of view, the purpose of this study is to reveal the SC applications 
developed in the context of sustainability and how technological innova-
tions affect the urban planning process. In this section, definite concepts will 
be focused such as sustainability, the SC, the role of smart cities in the pro-
cess of urban development, the use of ICT for sustainable urban develop-
ment, and strengths and opportunities for sustainable urban development 
that provide the use of AI applications and Big Data applications. Therefore, 
the impact on the practice of urban planning processes is evaluated within 
the scope of utilization of SC in the architecture of AI cities.
3.2  UTILIZATION OF SMART CITY (SC) IN THE 
ARCHITECTURE OF ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT 
CITIES
Urban systems have a complex and multi-layered structure. Urban issues 
vary under the influence of globalization and the growth process. These 
issues are exemplified as the extensive population movements, chaos, 
crime, traffic, waste, energy, water and air pollution, urban sprawl, etc. It 
is observed that traditional methods for solving the problems of urban sys-
tems are not responding. In other words, urban settlements have become 
almost a network of multi-turned-community living and new technological 
innovations have become almost an obligation in accordance to raise the 
level of welfare, population, resource, environment and information pro-
cessing technologies (Chamoso et al., 2018; Orselli and Akbay, 2019). Local 
authorities have increased significantly recently to improve the quality of life 
and satisfaction of citizens with public services by integrating information 
communication technologies into all areas of life (Harrison and Donnelly, 

22  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
2011). It is also an important proof that there has been a change in the axis 
of methods applied to urban systems.
At the heart of the idea of the “smart city” project is the idea of receiving 
high-tech support for the sustainable and efficient use of limited natural 
resources for unlimited human needs. The development of a new perspective 
on the problems faced by unlimited human needs decision-making mecha-
nisms at the local level in urban life shows its impact in many areas (Mangır, 
2016). It is clear that SC applications are an important tool for the develop-
ment of sustainable policies and practices in healthy, safe and high-quality 
living environments. It can be seen that there are the same goals and objec-
tives on the common ground of Industry 4.0 pioneered by Germany and 
Society 5.0 applications developed by Japan as an “innovative philosophy”. 
All these new and current applications, based on the idea of a human-cen-
tered society living in prosperity, come across as a model of society that is 
evaluated in all aspects under the impacts of digitalization and AI. Also, this 
model is provided in the most efficient way to integrate people’s relationship 
with machines and robots. Figure 3.1 shows a diagram of the components 
and application areas of SC applications.
Different definitions are included in the literature related to the con-
cept of SC. The concept of SC actually allows developing different points 
of view by means of these definitions. Ojo et al. (2016) define this con-
cept as the intellectual level needed to solve problems and support inno-
vation. Also, as another point of view, it can also be stated as a concept 
aimed at lifelong learning, natural resource use and sustainable develop-
ment (Ojo et al., 2016). Hollands (2008) defines it as a concept aimed at 
Figure 3.1  Components and application areas of smart city applications.
(Prepared by the author.)

From digital to sustainable urban systems  23
increasing the quality of human life, and social and economic develop-
ment (Hollands, 2008). In addition, Hall (2000) developed a definition 
of an innovative approach that arises from the acceptance and usage of 
ICT by urban residents that is provided by infrastructure and superstruc-
ture tools (Hall, 2000). Each definition looks at the concept of an SC 
from a different perspective in terms of its conceptual content and 
emphasizes the use of natural and built environmental components in a 
protection-usage balance.
The SC approach basically has three dimensions: human, collectivity and 
artificial intelligence. In addition, there are six main elements that contribute 
to the development of smart cities, namely smart citizens, smart governance, 
smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment and smart life (Giffinger 
et al., 2017; Fernandez-Anez et al., 2018). The implementation of these 
components specified in 3 dimensions is very important in terms of the SC 
decision-makers, compatible work in coordination and cooperation and 
reaching the intended targets within the SC concept. These targets can be 
listed as follows: (a) saving time, (b) improving individual mobility, (c) facili-
tating access to information and services, (d) saving energy and resources 
and (e) ensuring participation in decision-making processes (Chamoso et al., 
2018; Orselli and Akbay, 2019).
3.2.1 The use of artificial intelligence and information 
computer technology for sustainable development: 
strengths and opportunities
The idea of “Super Smart Society (Society 5.0)” was introduced at the 
CeBIT fair in 2017 and launched in the city of Tokyo. Society 5.0 aims 
to integrate technological developments into society to improve the qual-
ity of life at the social level and to build an intelligent society (Develi, 
2017). Actually, this idea was built on the idea of Industry 4.0 that marked 
the beginning of a new era of technological innovation in Germany in 
2011. The results of Industry 4.0 applications have given rise to the idea 
of Society 5.0. It is known that Industry 4.0 differs from previous versions 
with its characteristics such as speed, width, depth and system effect. From 
a conceptual point of view, the concept of “Super Intelligent Society” can 
be defined as the philosophy of social transformation. This is provided 
in the most efficient way by evaluating the impact of digital transforma-
tion on the world from demographic, economic, ethical and sociological 
aspects and also it is within the relationship of people in machines and 
robots (Ari, 2021).
As announced by the Japan Business Federation, when the main purposes 
of the idea of Society 5.0 are examined, there exist definite ones such as 
social and economic solutions to problems, forecasting possible conse-
quences that may occur as a result of rapid population growth and unsus-
tainable resource use and also promoting competitiveness among smart 

24  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
societies (Japan Business Federation, 2016). In terms of main goals, Industry 
4.0 and Society 5.0 differentiate. While Industry 4.0 focuses on production 
processes, Society 5.0 focuses on the quality of urban life, and the priority 
for technological innovation is given to sustainable social systems. The main 
goals of the idea of “Super Smart Society (Society 5.0)” can be listed as fol-
lows (Saracel and Aksoy, 2020):
	•	 The realization of individual reform
	•	 The accessibility to healthy and safe living spaces on an individual 
scale
	•	 The new economy and society structure is based on the principles of 
efficiency, innovation and globalization
	•	 The increase of resistance to disaster events occurring on the scale of 
cities, countries and the world
	•	 Ensuring the participation of all city stakeholders in new processes
	•	 The development of knowledge-based national strategies
	•	 The realization of social reform.
When the components of the Society 5.0 idea are examined, it is seen 
that ten basic components have been identified within the scope of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Two components among 
many components associated with urbanization and risk planning have 
been highlighted: (a) cities and regions (urban services with high stan-
dards, autonomous systems that raise living standards, regional strategic 
planning, etc.) and (b) disaster prevention and mitigation (sustainable 
distributed systems, internet of things, social media-supported studies, 
etc.). Due to the digital transformation, innovative technologies are com-
ing to the fore that forms the basis of smart cities. Web 2.0 and social 
media, cloud computing, wearable technologies, augmented reality, IoT, 
Big Data analytics and AI are numerous applications in SC technological 
development.

From digital to sustainable urban systems  25
	•	 The Concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI): It is a branch of science 
that studies how every cognitive activity that natural systems can do 
can be built into artificial systems. It aims at machine learning in a 
shorter time and in effective ways (Figure 3.2). One of the important 
applications envisaged within the scope of Society 5.0 is the preven-
tion of natural disasters and the implementation of early preventive 
interventions. It is possible to intervene instantly in disaster-affected 
areas through AI-based data analysis, air control radars, unmanned 
aerial vehicles (drones), damage information based on sensor data, etc. 
In the SC, digital and physical cities can be connected through IoT and 
thus create an integrated cyberspace. Huge and complex calculations 
with control operations can be solved through cloud computing. It 
is expected that AI applications will facilitate human development, 
­economic development and social interactions through smart services 
to create a sustainable urban environment with low carbon emissions 
(Li et al., 2015).
	•	 The Concept of Cloud Computing: Many definitions have been made 
related to cloud computing. According to the US National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, this concept is described in the form 
of low-level management effort or service provider interaction which 
can be released fast drying with computer networks, servers, storage, 
applications and services of the computing resources. These computing 
resources vary as an adjustable joint or common pool from anywhere 
in the network when requested to do so in a manner that provides 
convenient access to the model. In other words, cloud computing is 
a new type of IT as a service in which flexible and dynamically scal-
able and heavily virtualized resources are provided over the Internet 
(Turan, 2014). Cloud technology is defined as software applications 
accessed over the Internet, data storage service and processing capac-
ity, which has emerged as a solution to these problems (Bulut, 2018). 
Cloud computing technology is considered to be a wireless and ratio-
nal effective solution introduced into data storage services (Orselli and 
Akbay, 2019).
	•	 The Concept of Big Data: The traditional data analytics methods are 
insufficient in current conditions. So, IoT has become widespread and 
new generation data analytics methods have been needed. The Big 
Data method, unlike other methods, needs more comprehensive tools, 
algorithms and platforms. Actually, almost everyone, everything, every 
interaction and communication leaves a digital imprint with the rapidly 
renewed technology (McKinsey Company, 2013). Network sensors, 
smart objects and devices, data captured and saved by modern ICT 
constitute all edited the Big Data concept. The storage and processing 
of this Big Data constitute an important pillar of the SC platform. The 
way for intelligent systems to produce intelligent solutions is that the 

26  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Big Data collected from thousands of sensors every day is transformed 
into value-added information for urban people and managers through 
intelligent processes (Isbak, 2017; Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018).
As mentioned in Section 3.3.2, the role of ICT is significant in terms of sus-
tainable urban development processes and being useful to the strengths of 
urban systems. The main issues that have come to the fore in this context 
can be listed as follows (Thamarux et al., 2017; Meechang et al., 2020):
	•	 The linking with sustainable development in many countries
	•	 Bringing significant impacts in a symbolic manner of several dimensions
	•	 Reducing inefficiencies and ending poverty
	•	 Resolving damages in several counties equally
	•	 Making a difference in agricultural production processes
	•	 Improving an access to health care by facilitating faraway communica-
tion, monitoring system and enabling education
	•	 Increasing educational opportunities and reaching the underserved by 
all groups of people
	•	 Helping displaced persons and migrants to communicate with long-
distance friends and family and providing services during emergencies
	•	 Having the major role of collecting data and enhancing the monitor-
ing and warning systems
	•	 Being more transparent and accountable to their citizens by local 
government
	•	 Having an idea about the state of their city by citizens
	•	 The participation of citizens in decision-making and policy-making 
processes more actively
	•	 The ability of citizens to develop new services in accordance with 
expectations.
Generally stated, the main purposes of smart cities can be accomplished 
with technological facilities. Among various purposes, two purposes come 
to the forefront: (a) better use of urban public resources by reducing the 
transaction costs of smart cities and (b) improving the quality of services 
offered holistic, simple and a communications infrastructure that provides 
access to public services. These amenities provide important opportunities 
in many aspects such as transportation and parking, maintenance of public 
areas, city lighting, protection of cultural heritage, traditional public services 
such as garbage collection, and management and optimization (Gündüz and 
Daş, 2018). In addition, technological innovations will allow municipalities 
to obtain viable information to create solutions that can be actively used in 
the management processes of urban systems. In this context, technological 
innovations, including AI and ICT, provide the ability to understand the 
needs of the citizens, produce policies applicable and develop appropriate 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  27
models by local governments in terms of anticipating possible future policies 
of these problem areas (Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018).
3.2.2  Implementation of Big Data in smart city 
practice: examples for artificially intelligent 
cities
According to statistics released by the United Nations, 200,000 people per 
day migrate to urban areas worldwide and urbanization has increased six-
fold between the years 1950 and 2020 at the global level. In addition, 66% 
of the world’s population is expected to live in cities with most of the growth 
occurring in developing countries by the year 2050 (United Nations, 2020). 
As it is clear from the figures given, the effective and efficient management 
of limited resources and sustainable urbanization processes in the face of 
unlimited human needs will only be possible with innovative and intelligent 
solutions.
The level of smartness of any city is directly proportional to the integra-
tion of technology into urban life. In other words, the processes of urban 
residents’ adaptation to the digital infrastructure tools are the main determi-
nant of the degree of smartness. From this point of view, it can be said that 
one of the most important goals of SC applications is to ensure the partici-
pation of city stakeholders in decision-making processes (Fernandez-Anez 
et  al., 2018; Orselli and Akbay, 2019). Smart applications are rapidly 
becoming widespread in many cities around the world and new projects 
continue to be implemented every day in this direction. In this part of the 
study, examples of Big Data applications in the context of managing urban 
disaster risks will be given.
	•	 Big Data Applications of the City of Australia: One of the best prac-
tices of SC and ICT applications is The Trusted Information Sharing 
Network (TISN) for Critical Infrastructure Resilience. Through this 
application, government and business partners are working together 
to raise awareness of risk in urban areas related to the critical infra-
structure, share information on threats and risks, develop strategies 
and strategies to assess and reduce risk, and build resilience in organi-
zations (COAG National Disaster Resilience Statement, 2009).
	•	 United Kingdom Big Data Applications: The UK energy sector under 
the direction of the Energy Networks Association (ENA) has created 
an Engineering Technical Report on Resilience of Flooding of Grid 
and Primary Substations (ETR 138). As an example of Big Data appli-
cation, the electricity transmission and distribution industry has set 
targets (standards) for the durability of various assets in their sector 
(The World Bank, 2012).

28  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	•	 Japan Smart Big Data Applications: According to the report of the 
Smart City Resilience in Japan (2013), Japan’s city municipalities have 
direct responsibility for emergency response operations that serve 
as key liaison centers for the use of disaster prevention and recov-
ery. All three mobile network operators in Japan, NTT DoCoMo, Au 
and SoftBank Mobile have used the Cell Broadcast Service System, 
designed for this purpose, to send text messages in five languages to 
mobile users warning them of emergencies (Smart City Resilience in 
Japan, 2013).
	•	 Big Data Applications of the City of Buenos Aires: Buenos Aires has 
upgraded and updated its IT infrastructure with the International 
Journal of Governance and Public Policy Analysis (IJGPPA) SAP’s 
Mobile Platform technology and SAP Process Integration technology 
(Smart Cities Council India, 2018).
It has installed radar-enabled sensors in the canals to monitor flooding 
and 1500 km of pipeline infrastructure is operational. The information 
is included in the SAP HANA (SAP High-Performance Analytic Appli-
ance) program in which city authorities analyze weather reports, the 
status of waste collection, and citizens’ complaints about blocked canals 
and uncontrolled waste.
(Smart Cities Council India, 2018)
	•	 Sri Lanka City Big Data Applications: The government of Sri Lanka 
has used advanced ICT tools in disaster resilience by using the real-
time control system. The system planned four objectives to achieve 
within the period 2012 to 2020. However, in the stage of implementa-
tion, only one objective was achieved: developing an integrated flood 
control and water management information system. The main aim is 
to make the Colombo area an SC by proper utilization of ICT. Disaster 
resilience plans have been implemented to manage disasters in Sri 
Lanka (Kularathna and Geethamali, 2020).
3.3  FROM DIGITAL TO SUSTAINABLE: SMART CITY 
(SC) STRATEGY FOR URBAN PLANNING
The main purpose of the sustainable urban planning process is to make the 
urban area sustainable in terms of various aspects (economic, social, envi-
ronmental, administrative, etc.). This approach can be seen as an exten-
sion of the concepts of sustainable urban development process which are 
mentioned in the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment in 
Stockholm (Cömertler and Cömertler, 2021). The state of “competence” 
of the sustainability concept points especially to a capacity and condition 
problem. In other words, it is clear that this qualification related to the 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  29
competence state will not be achieved when the expected condition is not 
met or the current capacity is exceeded. The starting point for examining 
this state of “competence” is the use of natural resources and the mainte-
nance of economic development processes regardless of ecological values 
when the current state of the world has been considered (Zheng et al., 
2020).
Three important issues come to the fore in the focus of the recent discus-
sions on sustainable cities: (a) whether the social and economic needs of citi-
zens are sustainable, (b) whether sustainable spatial relationships are 
reflected in the growth processes of urban settlements, (c) whether the use of 
natural resources and sustainability in the provision of urban services can be 
ensured. From this point, the main rationale of the integration of the SC and 
sustainable urban planning is considering the ecological values and princi-
ples in the use of technological innovations. The adoption of eco-urban 
understanding, which is an important component of sustainable develop-
ment by different institutions and organizations, appears in a content that 
supports the vision of an SC and opens up new areas of application (Çetin 
and Çiftçi, 2017). In Figure 3.3, the relationship between the SC methodol-
ogy and the sustainable development concepts is presented with a schematic 
description.
The relationship between the SC and sustainable development has been 
emphasized through studies such as the New Urban Agenda and the 
Sustainable Development Goals. These studies have been prepared by the 
United Nations. The common issues are defending the view that the prob-
lems generating urbanization processes can be resolved by ICT and also by 
emphasizing the need for a sustainable development approach with environ-
mentally sensitive options (Kyriazopoulou, 2015; Gürsoy, 2019). The main 
objectives of these studies can be listed as follows:
Figure 3.3  The relationship between the smart city and sustainable development 
concepts.
(Prepared by the author.)

30  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	
a)	The design and planning of highly qualified public areas and services
	
b)	The establishment of integrated urban systems
	
c)	The ensuring the adaptation of increasing population and building 
density to design and planning processes
	
d)	The production and management of all kinds of information about 
urban areas
	 e)	 The implementation of the sustainable development goals.
Sustainable urban planning processes have been closely monitored and 
carefully examined which are put forward as the objectives by the United 
Nations and progressing due to technological developments around the 
world. It can be said according to these planning processes that the SC 
approach has been adopted significantly by different societies and organi-
zational structures and the trend toward smart cities has been increasing 
day by day. The reasons for this increase can be listed as follows (Akdamar, 
2017; Zheng et al., 2020):
	•	 Cities are in a global competitive environment.
	•	 The increasing population puts pressure on the existing natural 
resource capacity and technical infrastructure of cities.
	•	 The Big Data collected about the city makes it necessary to use tech-
nology in cities.
	•	 The production of policies and solutions that integrate technology 
with public life in order to improve the quality of life.
	•	 The optimization of the sustainable use of limited resources.
	•	 The existing problems are complicated due to the population increase 
and demand in urban areas.
	•	 The deepening of the gap between the built environment and the natu-
ral environment over time.
	•	 Technological innovations are a new and attractive opportunity to 
solve the problems observed in the urban area.
As a continuation of the topics highlighted in this context, this section will 
focus on important topics such as the role of the concept of sustainable 
development and SC in the development of policies and strategies during 
the planning processes, the objectives of the SC approach in terms of the 
operability and continuity of sustainable urban systems and also the advan-
tages and disadvantages of the SC approach to urbanization processes in the 
context of sustainability.
3.3.1 The motivation for sustainable SC strategy in 
the digital age
The report entitled “World Urbanization Prospects” has been prepared 
by the United Nations taking into account the population growth and the 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  31
urbanization rate. According to this report, the world population, which 
was 2.5 billion in the 1950s, is expected to be 9.7 billion in the year 2050. In 
addition, approximately 751 million people living in cities in the 1950s will 
increase to 6.7 billion people in the year 2050. Moreover, the urban popula-
tion rate is projected to increase by approximately 38.8% in the 100-year 
period between 1950 and 2050 (Cömertler and Cömertler, 2021).
Various approaches and models representing different perspectives have 
been put forward for solving environmental problems created by urbaniza-
tion processes throughout the world over time. For these approaches, there 
exist certain examples such as New Urbanism, Smart Growth, Sustainable 
Cities, Green Cities and Ecological Cities. However, none of these approaches 
has been observed to be completely successful and to improve the quality of 
urban life. As an alternative to this situation, new models and approaches 
have been developed that are produced by using new technologies. The 
Digital City, Intelligent City, Virtual City, Talented City, Cyber City, 
Information City and SC can be given as an example (Kyriazopoulou, 2015; 
Cömertler and Cömertler, 2021).
The difference between the concept of SC and other approaches is that the 
SC approach does not focus solely on technological possibilities and focuses 
on people and institutions. In other words, an SC is a transformation that 
affects many sectors with all its components. As a result of correctly evaluat-
ing the opportunities of developing technology, the protection of natural 
resources is ensured and also the contribution to the economic development 
of urban areas is provided by the urban services and new business models. 
As an important point, it should be noted that SC technologies are not a 
goal, but a very useful tool for ensuring urban sustainability (Chamoso 
et al., 2018; Cömertler and Cömertler, 2021).
The understanding of self-management in different types of urban ser-
vices (transport, energy, urban infrastructure, etc.) without the need for 
human intervention is very important for the citizens’ standards of living in 
urban areas. The importance of this issue originated from the expectations 
of urban citizens for better life quality. The SC approach provides significant 
advantages not only in terms of providing urban services to citizens with 
certain standards but also in terms of increasing the resilience of cities in the 
face of natural and/or human disasters. In other words, the SC concept is 
defined as the “transformation” philosophy needed to maintain the existing 
systems and infrastructures without interruption in urbanization processes 
(Altınışık, 2018; Zheng et al., 2020). In Figure 3.4, the approach that formed 
the basis of an SC is presented. Therefore, this approach has led to the birth 
of sub-specialization issues as a result of integrating the identification of the 
needs of cities and the usage of ICTs.
There exist two important criteria based on the concept of an SC. These 
are sustainability and communication. Related to the sustainability crite-
ria, certain leading components in ensuring sustainability in urban devel-
opment processes in smart cities can be listed such as ensuring the effective 

32  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
use of natural resources taking into account unlimited needs and increas-
ing population dynamics, minimizing environmental factors that are char-
acterized as external factors, high living standards can be offered to citizens 
living in urban areas. In addition to these components, there exist other 
facilitators such as the ability of computing systems for the need of instant 
data, using the operating infrastructure more effectively in the context of 
urban services, providing decision-making mechanisms consisting of 
stakeholders with the ability to produce effective policies in management 
processes carried out at the local level (Kyriazopoulou, 2015; Altınışık, 
2018).
The relationship between the discipline of urban planning and the SC 
approach is an indirect and continuous relationship. The main essential of 
this type of relationship is that traditional methods have been abandoned in 
order to manage and coordinate the complex and multidimensional prob-
lems faced by cities and also technological innovations have taken an active 
and effective role in urban planning processes. Actually, this essential may 
vary depending on different external factors (environmental pollution, dense 
urban population, global climate change, increasing energy demands, etc.). 
In other words, it is clear that the classical approaches and models cannot 
meet the problems and needs of today’s developing and changing cities in 
urban planning processes. Therefore, technology is now an indispensable 
element for establishing the supply and demand equilibrium that directly 
affects planning processes (Babahanoğlu et al., 2020).

From digital to sustainable urban systems  33
It is necessary to emphasize that the integration of the SC approach and 
sustainable city policies is based on certain basic principles. These principles 
can be expressed as the management, optimization, repeatability and evalua-
tion of opportunities, specialization, verifiability and comparability (Akdamar, 
2017). These principles make an important contribution to explaining these 
principles of the SC approach dominated by the “data-oriented management 
approach”. The principles expressed are frequently used not only in planning 
and policy-making studies at different scales in the discipline of urban plan-
ning but also in the academic literature, smart cities and AI applications which 
are based on the principle of effective use of ICT (Yeh, 2017).
The common issues in the implementation of the mentioned basic princi-
ples are the developed forecasts and strategies for the future of urban areas 
by stakeholders in decision-making processes. The discussion of develop-
ment strategy plans by using various methods (SWOT analysis, stakeholder 
analysis, scenario editing, staging, strategic planning studies, etc.), collecting 
and managing the Big Data many sectors throughout the city using various 
methods (classical and spatial statistics, modeling, CAD, and GIS-based 
analysis, machine learning, AI-based analysis, etc.).
3.3.2  Smart city objectives for sustainable urban 
systems
The technology-based developments that are witnessed nowadays show that 
the usage of ICT is changing urban life dynamics and the habits of citizens. 
The expectations of citizens have reached different heights at the end of 
this transformation process. As already mentioned, it has become impera-
tive that urban life integrates ICT applications into every field because of 
the development of new perspectives of local governments and citizens with 
the aim of enhancing the quality of life and satisfaction with public services 
and also solving many problems of urban facilities such as environment, 
water supply, housing, transport, communication, and urbanization pro-
cesses (Goodspeed, 2015).
The vision of “smart city” has led to the digitalization of cities over time 
and the acquisition of a “digital identity” of cities. It can be said that this 
vision is put forward to improve the quality of life in modern cities. According 
to the list in the “Motion Index 2018” published by IESE Cities in the year 
2018, smart cities are ranked according to 10 main topics and 83 indicators 
on sustainability and quality of life issues worldwide. The cities of New York, 
London, Paris, Tokyo, Reykjavik, Singapore, Seoul, Toronto, Hong Kong, 
Amsterdam and Songdo are included in this list (Cities in Motion, 2018). It is 
seen that as of 2018, preparatory studies have been carried out within the 
scope of the National Smart Cities Strategy and Action Plan in the case of 
Turkey (Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018). From this point, three important fea-
tures of the SC concept come to the fore: (a) being innovative, (b) having 
problem-solving ability and (c) active use of ICT applications. These features 

34  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
must contain basic principles such as inter-object interaction and communica-
tion, governance, sustainability, human focus and improving the quality of life 
in order to provide solutions to the problems caused by urban systems (Şahin 
and Örselli, 2003; Kyriazopoulou, 2015).
It has already been emphasized that the structure and problems of urban 
life have a complex nature. From this point of view, it can be said that estab-
lishing sustainability in urban areas with its social, economic and environ-
mental dimensions is a rather difficult and long-term process. However, the 
solutions produced to get used to this process have important opportunities 
in many issues because they have a multifaceted and far-reaching nature. 
Reducing disaster risks and implementing an effective risk planning process 
are some of these issues. Recently, SC applications are developed at the local 
level by municipalities with strategic planning studies and policies (housing, 
transportation, green and open areas, etc.) in the city. Besides, application 
areas related to emergency and disaster management have been adapted to 
SC applications (Yeh, 2017; Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018). The context of 
an SC can be described as an intelligent city. New technological options are 
implemented to provide more efficient, secure, and sustainable urban ser-
vices (Perboli et al., 2014). It is clear that the world has been depressed due 
to increasing urban populations, urbanization, migration, natural disasters, 
social problems, political instability, etc. (Harrison and Williams, 2016) 
(Figure 3.5).
As a new field, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) has been highlighted in the 
past two decades. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(UNDRR) defines this field as the process of using directives, organizations 
and capacities to implement strategies and policies and improve capacities 
in order to minimize disaster risks (UNDRR, 2020). ICT can be a useful tool 
for the entire phases of DRR which are used to store, process and distribute 
information. ICT is first needed for spatial and geographic information in 
mitigation plans to identify the appropriateness of land-use development 
plans. The other crucial point is that preparedness focuses on learning and 
awareness before taking action. So, ICT is useful for improving actions and 
strategies for urban areas related to DRR processes. The response phase 
requires ICT in order to alert target groups, provide impacts and communi-
cate in affected areas. In the fourth phase, ICT is needed for damage assess-
ment, evaluation of development plans and monitoring activities (Asian 
Disaster Preparedness Center, 2016).
It can be seen in the literature that many researchers have studied using 
technological tools in DRM practices and also urban planning processes. 
Geographic Information System (GIS), Social Networking Services (SNS) 
and applications which have been adopted for coping with disasters and 
urban problems are the popular tools. The GIS technology is popular in 
cases of simulation, forecasting and monitoring. There are various tools that 
GIS is the most well-known for spatial data survey. The risk maps help users 
to know the vulnerable areas and are useful for disaster preparedness. 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  35
Moreover, simulation outcomes usually come from GIS. The development of 
computer software requires the concern of all five factors but especially on 
perceived usefulness, in terms of effectiveness and accuracy, because it pres-
ents useful outcomes and visualized information (Meechang et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, there are many challenges and factors in implementing tech-
nology-based applications that should be considered in the SC concept. 
These issues can be listed as follows: (1) technology-based applications are 
reach and access, (2) effective use of these applications needs actions in all 
levels: nation and local levels, (3) policies and plans should be motivated by 
multi-stakeholders and (4) people-centric approach is more important than 
the techno-centric approach for the project.
3.3.3 The use of SC in urban planning process: pros 
and cons
The concept of an SC basically reflects the idea of restructuring cities in 
such a way as to ensure maximum efficiency for nature and mankind. In 
Figure 3.5  Information technology framework in smart city.
(Prepared by the author, adopted from Perboli et al., 2014.)

36  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
addition, the incorporation of an inclusive perspective on the development 
of urban areas in line with the SC approach is also one of the leading goals. 
As a reason for this incorporation, cities express a great source of hope in 
terms of the sustainability of natural resources in parallel with the increase 
in population and urbanization facilities (Beatley, 2000).
It is possible to say that sustainable urban development is directly related 
to the urban form, land use decisions and relations in transportation. The 
compact city form is considered to be a very suitable example of an SC 
approach. Actually, this form aims to ensure urban development in the 
medium and long term in accordance with the principles of continuity and 
innovation. The common issues of the sustainability concept and such cities 
can be listed as follows (Sınmaz, 2013):
	a.	The protection of natural resources and reduction of their consumption
	b.	Integrating the built environment with the natural environment
	c.	The adoption of a nature-centered lifestyle in urban areas
	d.	Increasing ecological awareness and reducing negative external 
influences
	e.	The prevention of uncontrolled spread of urban development areas
	f.	Ensuring maximum efficiency with low energy consumption
	g.	The establishment of integrated living spaces for safe and high quality 
of life settlements.
In addition to these common issues that are listed, the energy efficiency that 
has come to the fore in recent years in the SC approach and integrating a 
harmonious and efficient urban form with technological possibilities into 
existing urban residential areas are also among the issues that should be 
highlighted. This integration must necessarily include components such as 
supporting local economic potentials, projecting and implementing devel-
oped strategies, efficient use of urban land and improving the quality of life. 
Among new planning approaches that are taken into consideration, there 
exists New Urbanism (1990s), Smart Growth (2000s), Sustainable Cities 
(1970s), Ecological City (2000s), Green Cities (1996), Low-Carbon Cities, 
Livable Cities (1985), Citta Slow (1999), Urban Renaissance (1999) and 
Digital Cities approaches (Sınmaz, 2013).
SC strategies are presented with rich content. Actually, these strategies can 
be developed in planning studies carried out at different scales such as coun-
try, region and local scales. In Figure 3.6, basic factors affecting smart urban 
development strategies are presented. It is possible to list these strategies 
that have been frequently encountered in the academic literature recently 
and have been implemented in different examples as follows (Sınmaz, 2013; 
Martins, 2018):
	•	 Increasing the city’s competitiveness ability through creative initiatives
	•	 Improving the quality of life and encouraging participation in public life

From digital to sustainable urban systems  37
	•	 Supporting social and ethnic diversity
	•	 Supporting the participation of urban stakeholders in decision-making 
processes
	•	 Strengthening the information and communication infrastructure
	•	 Ensuring the organization of urban areas using technology
	•	 Ensuring the compact urban development
	•	 Spreading energy-efficient applications in cities.
It is seen that there are important decencies and mutually supportive com-
ponents between the basic components of sustainability and SC concepts. 
The most important similarity is the priority areas of application of both 
concepts are cities. It is clear that human and social capitals are two indis-
pensable elements both in economic development models and in the sustain-
ability of urban life (Gürsoy, 2019; Chamoso et al., 2020). From this point, 
as an important requirement, the integration of the concept of sustainability 
and the concept of SC is taking place in the smart urban development pro-
cess. The concept of sustainability with three main dimensions (environmen-
tal, social and economic dimensions) and also the concept of SC with three 
basic components (economic growth, ecological sustainability, ICT) play an 
active role in this process.
There are certain qualifications of a city being a “smart city”. These quali-
ties are considered a priority in terms of sustainability policies and also have 
a direct impact on urban planning processes. These qualities are effective 
from the existing building stock in urban areas to high-scale planning deci-
sions and can be listed as follows (Altınışık, 2018; Martins, 2018):
	•	 The construction of smart buildings
	•	 Designing urban elements–related transportation and infrastructure 
with intelligent planning techniques
	•	 Ensuring energy efficiency through intelligent systems
	•	 Advancing the management processes based on accurate and up-to-
date data by local governments
	•	 The classification of cities according to the level of adaptation and the 
usage of technological innovations
	•	 Decoupling the digital gap between different socio-economic groups 
of the city
	•	 Being the subject of policies and strategies developed at the country, 
region and local levels.
The fact that SC applications are the subject of policies and strategies devel-
oped at the country, region and local levels can be examined through the 
example of Turkey considering the mentioned qualities. In this context, there 
exist important examples for implemented projects such as e-Transforma-
tion Turkey Project, The Government Emergency Action Plan (2005), The 
Information Society Strategy Document (2006–2010), Tenth Development 

38  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Plan (2014–2018), The Strategy Document (2003–2023), Smart Cities 
Conferences and The Smart City Action Plan. These projects can be given as 
examples of projects that have been implemented at the country, region and 
local levels. Moreover, it can be said that these projects have adopted the 
SC approach and also implemented sustainable urban planning strategies.
In contrast to the successful cities where SC technologies are used today, 
many unsuccessful SC applications are observed throughout the world. 
When unsuccessful examples are examined in general, their main common 
features can be clearly revealed. Among these features, there exist the lack of 
a holistic and comprehensive development strategy for failed urban samples, 
focusing solely on the usage of technology in urban areas, excluding the 
human capital factor in the SC transformation processes, ignoring the 
involvement and influence of citizens in local decision-making processes and 
the lack of a balance between economic growth and environmental sustain-
ability (Chamoso et al., 2020; Cömertler and Cömertler, 2021).
Actually, the SC approach has been severely criticized for being overly 
focused on the usage of technology. This situation generates significant dis-
advantages. These disadvantages need to be addressed comprehensively in 
order to both revise the implementation processes of the cities adopting the 
SC approach and minimize the negative consequences that may occur in 
sustainable urban planning processes. According to the research that exam-
ines different application examples and is included in the academic litera-
ture, the main disadvantages of the SC approach can be listed as follows 
(Yıldırım, 2021):
	
a)	The fact that man-made errors and randomness will not completely 
disappear
	
b)	Easy and controllable access to personal data
Figure 3.6  Basic factors affecting smart urban development strategies.
(Prepared by the author.)

From digital to sustainable urban systems  39
	
c)	The fact that digital gaps may increase in terms of quality and quantity 
over time
	
d)	The restriction of free use of urban spaces by technology
	
e)	An interdisciplinary knowledge production is replaced by the subject’s 
production
	
f)	SC projects create social inequalities and exclusion from economic 
benefit for certain social groups
	
g)	The right to the city is not as easily accessible to urbanites as it was 
before
	
h)	The possibility that intelligent sociability can create control societies.
3.4  CONCLUSION
The phenomenon of urbanization is discussed through development activi-
ties at the global and local levels without being detached from the context of 
the SC while urban norms are questioned in the 21st century. In this context, 
the first of the applications implemented as a priority has been the usage 
of urban infrastructure supported by ICT. In the following process, smart 
cities have become an important source of motivation in terms of urban 
development processes. New concepts are frequently encountered, which 
are revealed by the SC approach both in academic literature and in applica-
tions from different disciplines at present. These concepts are examples of 
Big Data, open data, social capital, creativity, intelligent society, etc. (Yeh, 
2017; Yıldırım, 2021).
It is predicted that spatial quality and efficiency will increase at the same 
rate if the planning, design and management processes of smart cities are 
carried out together with the citizens. These processes are mainly based on 
ICT and data analytics. Actually, planning, design and management pro-
cesses will be carried out with the participation and cooperation of all stake-
holders in the city. A human-oriented approach comes to the fore with an SC 
approach in not only the urban planning scale but also the architectural 
scale (Martins, 2018; Chamoso et al., 2020; Yıldırım, 2021).
The SC approach does not have an understanding that blindly defends the 
idea that a city form focuses solely on the usage of technology. The reality is 
to see that there is a process of development by human capital. Currently, 
the fact that the concept of an SC is in the process of rapid development is 
an extremely understandable and predictable result. This result can be 
understood clearly when the components of the SC (governance, culture, 
people, technological innovations, etc.) and the smart people as one of the 
basic components of the SC approach are considered (Öztopçu and Salman, 
2019; Chamoso et al., 2020).
As a consensus, the SC approach has an important role and function in 
urban planning processes in the context of sustainability. Among the main 
reasons of generating this consensus, there exist (a) intelligent systems that 

40  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
provide positive externality in the face of increasing population and 
demands, (b) the elimination of the negative consequences of urban growth 
models in the medium and long term and (c) increasing the quality and 
quantitative maintenance of the livability of residential areas (Öztopçu and 
Salman, 2019).
The realization of the goals and programs envisaged by the development 
plans in the direction of solving problems related to urban development 
today depends only on the effective operation of the planning, implementa-
tion, monitoring, supervision and control system in full coordination. The 
basis of this system is accurate, up-to-date, reliable and standard informa-
tion. When this system is again operated in an organized manner with full 
coordination between the country’s institutions, it can become efficient and 
effective in the direction of the country’s development. Such an environment 
can only be carried out with the ability of an effectively functioning state 
system, qualified manpower, high technological information and hardware 
infrastructure. In accordance with these statements, various suggestions for 
eliminating the observed deficiencies in sustainable urban planning pro-
cesses that takes advantage of effective and technological opportunities 
including the SC approach and improving the systems that are currently 
being used can be listed as follows:
	
a)	Technology-based applications: The accessibility to real-time and in-
stant information using the Big Data method, controlling road net-
works using image processing technologies, advancing platforms that 
bring together all stakeholders with developed decision support sys-
tems and share information, developing early warning systems and 
location determination using the social media data processing system 
and optimizing the resource assignment according to needs of people 
using social media data processing system.
	
b)	Applications based on decision mechanisms: Using the decision tree 
method to make estimates of humanitarian assistance and shorten the 
decision-making periods, the resource assignment, the recommenda-
tion for benefit – enabling cost analysis, urban development scenarios’ 
building, enhancing to assist and advise in formulating all phase of 
urban planning by local governments, the development of a compre-
hensive and systematic approach, the utilization from technological 
tools, the establishment of technology-based platforms at the national 
level, the development of international cooperation in terms of the use 
of satellite communication systems.
	 c)	 Sustainable urban development-based applications: Producing strate-
gic plans for effective urban-management systems, the clarification of 
standard terminology and concepts, the determination of policies and 
strategies for urban planning in the medium and long term, the utiliza-
tion of technological facilities, bringing new perspectives to urbaniza-
tion processes by the effects of ICT, the contribution to sustainable 

From digital to sustainable urban systems  41
urban development and facilitating public services and the determina-
tion of the current potentials and limits of urban settlements.
Smart city strategies that are implemented at different levels are important 
for especially urban areas. The SC approach is quite necessary and impor-
tant for the realization of important goals through the SC components. 
These goals vary according to the qualifications of urban areas such as the 
planning of urban settlements due to their geographical structure and socio-
economic relations, increasing public areas with the principle of the social 
benefit, increasing cities’ number that have gained self-sufficiency skills at 
the local level, strengthening the urban infrastructure by using technological 
innovations, planning urban areas which are more resilient to disasters and 
taking into account the development trends of these urban areas and also 
preparing for the future by managing sustainable urban planning processes. 
It should be remembered that it is no longer possible to maintain urban 
planning processes by the way of traditional methods correctly and adapt-
able to current changes in technology.

4.1  INTRODUCTION
The concept of the smart city contributes to a digital environment that 
increases the security and efficiency of city systems and strengthens citi-
zens’ participation in urban development; thus, the concept of smart city 
is evolving very fast all over the World (
; Su et al., 2011). 
The usage of geographical data on the built and natural environments and 
urban services is the basis of the concept of smart city (Angelidou, 2014; 
Meijer and Bolívar, 2016). The successful project implementation of smart 
city needs digital systems that can visualize and manage geographical data. 
Geographical Information System (GIS) provides user-friendly and advanced 
capabilities for smart city studies (Roche, 2014). Chapter 2 includes how 
GIS can assist the smart city project or implementation. At the conclusion 
of this chapter, the reader will understand what geographical information 
system (GIS) is, GIS-based smart city applications and artificial intelligence 
perspective for GIS-based management.

46  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
The geospatial data consist of (Breunig et al., 2020; Dangermond and 
Goodchild, 2020) the following:
	 (i)	urban services in municipal facilities for transport, water, waste, edu-
cation, energy and health
	 (ii)	air quality, green spaces, biodiversity, soil and water as the natural 
environment and
	 (iii)	buildings, infrastructure and public spaces as the urban built 
environment.
The concept of smart city supplies information about the urban services 
performances and infrastructure to the city managers. Analysis of these data 
lets decision-makers develop the efficiency of the quality of urban services. 
The developing technology enables to accomplish more agile management 
that develops the quality of life in cities and also improves the economic 
development (Shahrour, 2018).
GIS-based smart city solutions enable policymakers to carry out spatial 
data with geographical location and combine them with existing or using 
applications. These solutions provide visualizing scenarios, extending intel-
ligence, performing more informed decisions and addressing complex issues 
(Tiwari and Jain, 2014).
4.2  GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND 
THE SMART CITY CONCEPT
What the Geographical Information System (GIS) is and what the compo-
nents of GIS are the main questions of this section. Additionally, GIS and the 
smart city concept integration are also discussed in detail.
GIS produces, analyzes, manages, visualizes maps of data and also links 
data to a map and integrates spatial data with descriptive information 
(Gold, 2006; Maliene et al., 2011). In other words, where things are linked 
to what things are like there. This capability provides an opportunity to map 
and analyze almost every industry. Additionally, GIS assists users to under-
stand geographical context, relationships and patterns. The main advan-
tages of GIS are listed as better management and decision-making (ESRI, 
2021). The components of GIS are data, software, hardware, people and 
methodology (Bolstad, 2019).
Data: The core of GIS is geospatial data. Vector data and raster data are the 
types of data used in GIS. Points, lines and polygons are used as vector 
data to present spatial data. Satellite imagery and digital elevation models 
(DEMs) are cell-based data called raster data.
Hardware: Hardware is used to store and access GIS data and computer 
software applications. Computers, hard disks and printers are examples 
of hardware.

GIS-based management  47
Software: GIS software is composed of a graphical user interface with menu 
options. The GIS software enables users to store, manage, digitize and 
query on GIS data. Also, they perform complex analyses and prepare 
reports, maps and charts.
People: Well-trained GIS users or professionals skilled in using GIS software.
Methodology: To successfully combine GIS into an existing information 
technology framework. Additionally, every organization needs a method-
ically considered and overarching business plan.
Using GIS as a decision support system provides a chance to identify prob-
lems, to monitor changes, to respond to events, to do forecasting, to under-
stand trends and to arrange priorities. At this point, the important subject 
is how GIS works. GIS technology uses geographic science to get actionable 
intelligence from data via maps, data, analysis and apps tools. Maps are 
the geographical tools for the data layers. They are embedded in apps and 
shared easily; therefore, they are accessible virtually. GIS combines many 
different types of data with geographical component layers using spatial 
information. GIS data also includes features, imagery and basemaps. Spatial 
analysis allows users to evaluate capability and suitability, understand data, 
interpret and forecast data for decision-making. GIS apps work on desk-
tops, in web browsers, on mobile phones and tablets. They provide focused 
user experiences for getting work done (Lukasheh et al., 2001).
4.3  GIS-BASED SMART CITY APPLICATIONS
In recent years, the rapid growth in population and urbanization in cities 
has brought different problems such as water, air and soil pollution due 
to unconscious and excessive consumption of resources. What is happen-
ing in cities and how to improve the life quality of citizens are the main 
questions of Smart City apps. In order to get the answers to these ques-
tions, we need mass data. The data is both current and historical, static 
and dynamic, also geometrical and semantic, etc. GIS uses these data in 
decision-making in cities to describe the horizontally distributed urban 
environment. Besides GIS, Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are the smart city apps to 
manage a city’s assets. Smart cities have a key role in cities’ transporta-
tion, health, energy, and education sectors and also transforming areas 
of human life. Governments have begun to use smart city applications to 
improve the quality of life of their citizens (Cao and Wachowicz, 2019; 
Sahoo and Rath, 2017).
Electricity Distribution Information System: It is a GIS-based operating 
system where electricity distribution networks can be managed online 
based on rules and has desktop and web applications. Users authorized 
in the system can add, edit and query electrical objects on the map, make 

48  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
electrical queries and get graphical results with advanced reporting sup-
port. The regions fed by the feeders, transformers and lines defined in the 
system can be monitored by establishing a topology on the map. Reports 
on this information can be obtained (Electricity Consumption Report-
Subscriber Distribution Report-Federal Transformers Report-Thematic 
Consumption Map, etc.) (Başarsoft, 2021).
Interruption Information System: It helps to focus on which regions and 
transformers cause more cost or loss of revenue according to the types 
of power outages, to find the places where the cost is the highest, and to 
provide information to hundreds of thousands of subscribers (Başarsoft, 
2021). The examples below are the analysis of the system:
	•	 Finding the ten most costly outage types
	•	 Sorting download centers and feeders by downtime costs
	•	 Evaluation of budget requests (Benefit-Cost Analysis)
	•	 Interactive view – allows the user to see the weak spot in the sys-
tem in seconds
	•	 Provides the opportunity to prioritize the areas to be corrected
	•	 Provides the opportunity to go into details; such as downloader, 
feeder, substation and feeding zone.
Water and Sewerage Infrastructure Information System: With the use of 
Water and Sewerage Infrastructure Information System, GIS-based sub-
scriber, network, network inventory and infrastructure operations can 
be transferred to digital media and their tracking can be facilitated. By 
knowing where the subscribers in the subscriber information system are 
in the real world, meter removal-installation, maintenance-repair-fault 
operations and which subscribers may be affected by these operations 
can be found. In addition, where and how much water is consumed can 
be calculated and reported according to the need (Başarsoft, 2021).
Intelligent Water Loss Management Platform: It is a GIS-based management 
system integrated with business and SCADA. The benefits of this system 
can be listed as
	•	 Calculation of water losses
	•	 Finding the amount of physical and administrative loss
	•	 Reducing losses by monitoring the loss, leakage change and mini-
mum night flow rate in pressure management administrations
	•	 Calculation of infrastructure leakage index
	•	 Seeing the amount of water supplied and billed water in different 
periods
	•	 Subscriber list in the region
	•	 Allows calibration with hydraulic model integration with epanet 
exchange format for each feeding zone
	•	 Failure maintenance and repair records, subscriber data can be 
seen, commitment analysis can be made.

GIS-based management  49
Natural Gas Infrastructure Information System: The Natural Gas Infrastruc-
ture Information System is an information system in which geographical-
based address and network data are digitized and transferred to digital 
media, ensuring the integrity and management of the data, and easier 
tracking of the subscribers in the Subscriber Information System with 
their real and accurate locations on the map. With the Natural Gas In-
frastructure Information System, fault maintenance/repair, meter instal-
lation and removal can be done faster and more coordinated through 
the correct locations of address and network data. In addition, reports 
can be produced according to subscriber consumption and the number 
of subscribers, and answers can be found to the questions of where the 
consumption is intense and where the potential subscribers are. With the 
Natural Gas Infrastructure Information System, maps needed for opera-
tional processes in the field can be prepared, allowing users to quickly 
access map data from mobile devices (Başarsoft, 2021).
Communication Infrastructure Information System: Communication Infra-
structure Information System is a GIS-based system in the telecom sec-
tor, from project design to inventory management, from fault tracking to 
investment decision support reports including desktop, web and mobile 
applications (Başarsoft, 2021).
Transportation and Public Transport: With GIS technology, the most perma-
nent analyses and plans can be produced, transportation and traffic prob-
lems can be solved and the integration and simultaneous management of 
public transportation vehicles can be achieved by including topics such as 
urban transportation problems, air pollution, energy, infrastructure and 
landscaping. By performing density analyzes in public transportation, 
it can be determined where the new stop should be placed (Başarsoft, 
2021).
4.4 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE FOR 
GIS-BASED MANAGEMENT
Artificial intelligence can be defined as the realization of machine and com-
puter operations that understand and exhibit the human intelligence and 
thinking structure (Xinxiang et al., 2020; Costache et al., 2019). In other 
words, artificial intelligence can also be defined as computers equipped with 
human-specific capacities such as information acquisition and extraction, 
perception, thinking and decision-making (Li, 2020; Janowicz et al., 2020). 
With artificial intelligence, it is possible to analyze very large amounts and 
very different types of data that cannot be directly processed by human 
beings; therefore, the common emphasis of the definitions of artificial intel-
ligence in the literature can be expressed as making machines smarter and 
more useful systems for purpose of usage (Hu et al., 2019; Xie, 2020).

50  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
The concept developed as GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) in the 
literature is based on the combination of advanced analysis techniques of 
artificial intelligence techniques with the extensive database of GIS and a 
wide variety of application approaches (Chauhan and Shekhar, 2021; Zhou, 
2019). With artificial intelligence, many classical GIS applications have 
evolved to respond to more complex problems such as image classification, 
pattern and pattern extraction, production of sensitivity and risk maps, as 
well as in areas such as health, transportation, agriculture and environmen-
tal ecology (Nugroho and Supangkat, 2021; Domènech, 2017). GeoAI tech-
nology also provides tools for capturing objects in 3D models which have 
applications in urban planning, public transportation, Building Information 
Modelling, etc. (Homainejad, 2015).
The advanced technologies used with the artificial intelligence methodol-
ogies for the benefit of society in the spatial visualization, analysis, modeling 
of phenomena and human activities that appear everywhere from the center 
of the earth to space and the cyber world can be defined as spatial intelli-
gence or geospatial intelligence. Spatial data have been obtained in different 
ways such as from traditional vector and raster data and from more recent 
types such as geo-tagged social media postings (e.g., tweets) and mixed data 
from connected vehicles (Li and Huang, 2019; Zhu et al., 2021).
Most studies searching for artificial intelligence methods in GIS projects 
have basically focused on enhancing alternative approaches in spatial pat-
terns and using artificial intelligence techniques in order to achieve percep-
tion about spatial processes and spatial functions through factor sensitivity 
tests and rule extraction. The main task of GIS in decision-making process 
is the usage of varied geographical layers having spatial information. 
Decision support systems are examples of where GIS can be linked with the 
artificial intelligence community. Artificial neural networks are appropriated 
for actualizing supervised classification tools for GIS data. Artificial neural 
networks and GIS integration is used in order to improve decision-making. 
The integration of these two methods offers a potential tool to decrease the 
cost of analysis of spatial information by reducing the amount of time spent 
interpreting data (Voženílek, 2009).
Smart cities have the concepts of numerous factors such as increasing 
demand for city services and products, population increase, technological 
advancement and advancement in education. GeoAI-based smart cities 
applications have indicated improvements in communications, transport 
infrastructures, security, healthcare services and access to quality social ame-
nities and services (Allam and Dhunny, 2019).
4.5  CONCLUSION
This chapter includes GIS Technologies, GIS-based smart city applications 
and artificial intelligence perspectives for GIS-based management. Cities have 
complex systems involving interconnected economic, social, physical and 

GIS-based management  51
spatial processes of dynamic temporal change. Therefore, cities have a lot of 
types of real-time geospatial data. These data are collected via both physical 
and social sensing. Additionally, they are also processed by geospatial technol-
ogies in order to create smart cities. Once data are obtained via these technol-
ogies, analyzing and interpreting them are important for creating smart cities. 
The continuous stream of real-time data also requires in-time predictions in 
cities. Another important tool is the visualization of these data that conveys 
the urban design to decision-makers, planners and stakeholders. From a visu-
alization point of view, the dashboards are becoming popular tools in smart 
city technologies in order to provide graphic-based and dynamic visualization 
to represent real-time data in a single view. They have been progressively used 
in GIS-based smart city applications to do real-time monitoring of city infra-
structure. They are also used in order to communicate open government data 
with the general public by government agencies.

56  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
5.1  INTRODUCTION
Currently, more than half of the world’s population live in cities. Urban 
population is globally at a rapid increase and is expected to be 6.68 billion 
by 2050 (United Nations, 2018). Urbanisation generates numerous essential 
and major economic, social, and demographic alterations because cities are 
not only hubs of human activity but also areas where societal, economic, 
and environmental needs are amplified (Abu-Lughod and Hay, 2013). As 
a result, cities are faced with a plethora of problems as their resources and 
infrastructure are strained to breaking point (Breetzke and Flowerday, 
2016). Problems such as parking allocation, traffic congestion, pollution, 
and waste management occur as the city grows, and resources become lim-
ited. As a result, trying to adapt the city to existing (and future) demands is 
a top concern for all, including researchers (Camero and Alba, 2019).
The use of information and communication technology (ICT) is a rising 
trend for managing and minimising the effect of these problems on society 
and the environment. Simply put, the use of ICT within cities has brought 
about the term “Smart cities”. The smart city concept arose from the 
notion of how ICT could help cities run smoother and more efficiently 
(Batty et al., 2012). These sophisticated cities must employ new technol-
ogy to enhance their fundamental systems to achieve maximum efficiency 
in all aspects of city management while conserving energy (Wang et al., 
2021). This topic is proven to be a powerful study area that is attracting a 
lot of interest from academics and practitioners alike. Many cities are con-
centrating their attention to become “smarter” by using ICT to enhance 
different elements of city operation and management, such as local econ-
omy, environment, transportation, traffic management, public services, 
and quality of life (Li et al., 2017). Smart cities have caught the attention 
of researchers across multiple research areas such as Internet of Things 
(IoT) and Information Systems (IS). This can be understood from the 
growing body of research published in academic journals, publications, 
and conference proceedings.
Many countries have advocated the notion of smart cities for the effective 
management and optimisation of resources in order to deal with the rapid 
development in urbanisation. These countries have planned and imple-
mented smart city programmes to address the emerging difficulties. To meet 
the criteria of a smart city, effective use of ICTs is critical (Neirotti et al., 
2014; Petrolo et al., 2016; Aguilera et al., 2017; Al-Turjman and Baali, 
2019) to appropriately administer data analysis and for the successful 
implementation of complex strategies to ensure a smart city’s smooth and 
secure functioning (Ullah et al., 2020). Many projects, ranging from city 
councils and enterprises to research laboratories, are emerging around the 
world to make cities more ideal places for quality living. People from vari-
ous disciplines, cultures, histories, and interests, are coming together to 
achieve a shared goal, making the city smart (Camero and Alba, 2019). 

Industry 4.0 for smart cities  57
Climate change, global warming, and the shift towards renewable energy 
have fuelled the rise of smart cities, which attempt to provide basic needs of 
the public while diminishing negative environmental repercussions. 
However, each city’s smart city preferences and principal implementations 
are unique, and these smart gadgets and systems will continue to be employed 
in the future. Furthermore, due to the growing population in urban areas, 
adequate services and environmental needs are harder to fulfil; as a result, 
IoT technologies have emerged as a viable answer for establishing a func-
tioning smart city (Jin et al., 2014). Collecting, monitoring, archiving, and 
sharing open sensor data from IoT devices are also significant aims for smart 
city development and research (Pflanzer et al., 2018; Kirimtat et al., 2020).
The usage of IoT and big data technologies are driving the development 
of smart cities around the world, with smartness attributed to the applica-
tion of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and tools (Souza et al., 2019). 
The notion is to employ current technology to transform every entity of a 
traditional city into an autonomous entity that can run on its own without 
any external assistance. All processes, such as governance and services, are 
automated, and users can access them via smart devices from any location. 
Smart transportation, smart economy, smart environment, smart gover-
nance, smart infrastructure, smart policies, smart healthcare, smart agricul-
ture, smart education, smart industry, and smart energy are the core entities 
of a smart city ecosystem (Nam and Pardo, 2011; Su et al., 2011; Balakrishna, 
2012).
Various studies (Hollands, 2008; Agarwal et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016; 
Adio-Moses and Asaolu, 2016; Batty, 2018; Rjab and Mellouli, 2018; 
Scoblete, 2018; Voda and Radu, 2018) suggest that the future technical 
infrastructure of a smart city is largely built on AI, which is a significant 
component in city growth.
The purpose of this chapter is to identify the relationships between the 
smart city dimensions and Industry 4.0, their common enabling technolo-
gies, and their relevance in improving the development of the Smart Cities 
concept, as a guide to researchers and practitioners. As a result, this chapter 
also aims to improve the understanding of AI’s involvement in various smart 
city dimensions.
5.2  INDUSTRY 4.0
The term Industry 4.0 was established in Germany in 2011 and can be 
defined as a unified term for technologies and concepts of a value chain 
organisation that is based on real-time connectivity of data enabled by IoT, 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Services (IoS), big data, and smart 
factory among other technologies (Hermann et al., 2016).
The interconnection of technology is a significant feature of Industry 
4.0. This connectivity takes the shape of expanded digital capabilities that 

58  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
grow as they emerge and become embedded in people’s lives. The conver-
gence of data based on immense storage and cognitive capability is eventu-
ally the result of this revolution at each level of society and industry. This 
has opened up previously unimagined possibilities in practically every 
industry, including education, health, and services. Industry 4.0 is built on 
core technological concepts such as AI, IoT, cloud computing, robotics, 
blockchain, additive manufacturing, and virtual and augmented realities. 
All of these notions are crucial in developing Industry 4.0 (Ghodmare 
et al., 2021).
5.3  SMART CITY
The smart city concept is based upon two distinct phenomena: the need 
to overcome the challenges of urbanisation and the opportunity provided 
by new technology. Smart city can also be considered an innovation in 
that it introduces new technology, processes, policies, and management 
approaches. Smart city definitions are not uniform; instead, there are a vari-
ety of definitions, models, and frameworks. When comparing these defini-
tions, it is apparent that they all involve two systems that must be in sync 
to achieve smart city status: the social system (people, organisations, and 
government) and the technical system (software, hardware, and intelligent 
systems) (Kopackova and Libalova, 2017).
Several researchers have offered numerous definitions of a smart city from 
multiple points of view. It is defined by Harrison et al. (2010) as the connec-
tion between ICT, social, and physical infrastructure to increase the smart-
ness of a city. It is defined as a modern city by Kondepudi et al. (2014), 
which must draw from ICT to enhance citizens’ quality of life. Many defini-
tions also substitute “smart” with adjectives such as “intelligent” or “digi-
tal”. A “smart” city optimises the supply of services by utilising technology 
while maintaining a balance between sustainability and competitiveness. A 
smart approach tries to improve people’s quality of life by utilising technol-
ogy to assist in this process (Storolli et al., 2019). These definitions show 
that a smart city is an urban environment armed with ICT technology for 
improving day-to-day city operations and living (Silva et al., 2018).
The term “smart” refers to an automated method used to carry out a cer-
tain task within a domain. In a smart home, for example, all appliances and 
electrical equipment such as washing machines, HVAC systems, ovens, and 
fans are embedded with small sensors that can sense surroundings, collect 
data, and send it to processing hubs where dynamic rules and regulations 
can be used to make decisions. Unlocking and locking doors and windows, 
as well as turning on and off gadgets, are all automated and controlled by 
small hand-held smart devices (Nam and Pardo, 2011; Balakrishna, 2012; 
Guelzim et al., 2016). A city that is equipped with ICT infrastructure is 
referred to as an intelligent city (Malek, 2009).

Industry 4.0 for smart cities  59
A smart city is deemed a hybrid of a knowledge society and digital city. 
An intelligent city enables interactive tools, digital collaboration spaces, and 
embedded technologies to boost the local innovation system, and the goal of 
an intelligent city is to revolutionise life and work in critical and founda-
tional ways (Komninos and Sefertzi, 2009). A digital city explains the city’s 
qualities from a technical standpoint; however, a smart city encompasses the 
human, governmental, and other aspects of the city, in addition to the tech-
nology. As a result, a smart city must primarily be digital, while a digital city 
is not necessarily smart. A digital city is more technologically focused and 
has distinct boundaries, while a smart city is concerned with both sustain-
ability and technology (Yin et al., 2015).
Regardless of the rising importance of smart cities, there is no common 
definition. Academic literature proposes definitions to include multiple fea-
tures to develop more inclusive definitions. Companies, such as IBM and 
Oracle that produce smart technologies, add more practical values to the 
concept (Mosannenzadeh and Vettorato, 2014). However, the adoption of 
innovative technologies, collaboration with urban elements, and the use of 
big data are among the frequently encountered elements used in the 
definitions.
Smart transportation, smart energy, smart buildings, smart security, smart 
health, smart tourism, smart governance, and smart life applications that 
meet the needs of the increasing urban population and adapt technological 
developments are the main smart city solutions (Köseoğlu and Demirci, 
2018). In this context, smart transportation solutions such as tracking the 
occupancy rate of car parks, collecting and sharing pricing information, 
vehicle information, and traffic density data are used with the help of sen-
sors to be placed in suitable places for urban transportation. With smart 
economy solutions, applications that will contribute to the entrepreneurship 
and production capacity of the city are applied. Smart environmental solu-
tions are applied, such as monitoring air and water pollution through sen-
sors, and energy-saving thanks to buildings compatible with new 
technologies. In addition, smart life solutions related to daily life such as 
water, health, temperature, and lighting are also becoming widespread 
(Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018). When looking at the examples of service 
quality, resource savings, and efficiency provided by smart city applications, 
an example can be found in South Korea, which has digitised the entire sup-
ply cycle (including registration, bid notification, tender, contracts, and 
inspection), savings of around 40 billion dollars were achieved in 2010. 
Indonesia, by using e-procurement applications in purchasing processes in 
central and local governments, transportation, and accommodation, has 
achieved 26 billion dollars in cost savings in transactions between 2008 and 
2013 (Collin et al., 2016).
In many cities, it is possible to come across ongoing projects. For exam-
ple, in Barcelona, the garbage level is remotely monitored and garbage 
collection services are optimised through sensors placed in the garbage 

60  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
cans. In addition, it was decided to use smart water systems to manage 
irrigation in the green areas of the city. Sensors in street lamps adjust the 
light intensity according to daylight. In Songdo, South Korea, water and 
electricity usage is monitored through smart systems in buildings, signals 
of the vehicles are detected by the sensors on the road to monitor the traf-
fic flow, and smart street lamps adjusted for pedestrian traffic are used 
(Petrolo et al., 2016). In Turkey, there are administrative units related to 
smart cities, both within the body of the relevant ministries and institu-
tions in the central administration and in the municipalities that develop 
policies in this regard.
5.4  DIMENSIONS OF SMART CITY
Although there are many definitions of the term smart city, there seems 
to be an agreement as to the dimensions of the smart city concept within 
the literature. These dimensions are smart mobility (transportation), smart 
economy, smart people, smart living (life), smart environment, and smart 
governance (Giffinger and Gudrun, 2010; Köseoğlu and Demirci, 2018; Al 
Sharif and Pokharel, 2021).
Smart Economy comprises e-business and e-commerce, as well as manu-
facturing and service delivery, innovation, and new goods, services, or busi-
ness models. It also entails the use of ICTs to enable the responsible use of 
resources.
Smart Mobility comprises the use of ICTs to improve transportation and 
logistics. Smart transportation helps to alleviate traffic congestion while also 
encouraging people to use public transportation. The use of public transpor-
tation and cycling reduces the number of vehicles on the road. Electric cars, 
particularly when shared, help to make transportation more environmen-
tally friendly. Drivers can save time by using mobile applications that pro-
vide real-time traffic information, closures, and limitations.
Smart Environment includes smart energy (improved by smart energy 
grids, metering, renewable energy sources, control, and monitoring), water, 
green urban planning, green buildings, urban services (public lighting and 
waste management), and resource efficiency (Park et al., 2013; Corbett and 
Mellouli, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Smart utilities use the necessary amount 
of energy or water needed, resulting in less waste. Existing systems are made 
more efficient with smart utility infrastructure, while new means of produc-
ing and transporting water, gas, and electricity are discovered, ensuring 
green and sustainable development.
Smart People is focused on boosting creativity and promoting innovation 
to enable working (e.g., remote work), human resources, capacity manage-
ment, and education and training (Camero and Alba, 2019).
Smart Governance is concerned with the use of ICTs to improve public ser-
vices (e-government) and to facilitate better planning and decision-making.

Industry 4.0 for smart cities  61
Smart Living refers to the use of ICTs to enable new (and enhanced) life-
styles while also delivering a secure and healthy city that is appealing to 
people. Smart healthcare and public safety are sub-dimensions of smart 
living.
Smart Healthcare makes it easier to get a faster and more accurate diag-
nosis. Patients have online access to their health records, giving them influ-
ence over the care they get. The sharing of data among healthcare 
practitioners makes illness diagnosis easier and eliminates multiple medicine 
prescriptions. The communication platform enables emergency services to 
respond quickly. For those who are unable to travel to hospitals, videocon-
ferencing technology allows for remote medical care.
Smart Public Safety entails a quick response to emergencies and threats by 
utilising real-time data. Data obtained from city cameras can provide fire 
and police departments with real-time information. Citizens can use social 
networks to communicate with one another via push messaging, or citizens 
can offer information about the current situation, assisting public safety 
professionals in managing the crisis. Furthermore, to manage an emergency 
scenario, data must be processed in order to deliver alarms, notifications, 
and suggestions to the decision-maker.
5.5  ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES
Innovative information technologies like IoT, cloud computing, and big data 
have been widely embraced in a range of fields over the previous years. IoT 
allows cities to receive distant sensor data and control the physical environ-
ment from afar, allowing them to sense and manage critical elements such 
as mobility and transportation networks, building operations, and water 
supply effectively (Kopetz, 2011).
A smart city is driven and enabled by interdisciplinary technology (Wenge 
et al., 2014), particularly data processing technologies. Cloud computing, 
big data, and IoT are just a few of the revolutionary information technolo-
gies that have been widely employed in the smart city concept (Nam and 
Pardo, 2011). Data-centric enabling technologies play an essential role in 
the implementation of smart cities in these cases.
The notion of using technology to improve the quality of life by mak-
ing it easier and more efficient is not new. Humanity has been using 
technology in daily routines to reach some level of automation and deci-
sion-making for many years. A multitude of new technologies is being 
used to attain a smart and sustainable lifestyle as the globe moves 
towards Industry 4.0. Modern technology has enabled the realisation of 
smart cities. Many current and new technologies are combined to assist 
in the creation of a smart city’s connected network of devices and entities 
(Ahad et al., 2020).

62  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
5.5.1  Cloud/edge computing
Cloud computing provides access to computing power and application 
(Deloitte, 2015) as well as a hub to store data collected from CPS, sensory 
devices, and the IoT security protocols for big data technology and ICTs.
5.5.2 Artificial intelligence
In a smart city setting, AI helps with the analysis and processing of data 
created through machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. This technol-
ogy provides predictive and preventive decision-making, as well as holistic 
insights into systems (Skouby and Lynggaard, 2014; Batty, 2018).
5.5.3  Internet of Things
IoT refers to the use of sensors and wireless communication on a large scale 
throughout all physical objects. The connectivity of devices on such a wide 
scale creates mammoth amounts of data. The combination of sensors and 
wireless communication between devices creates a complex network and 
many intelligent systems emerge from this connectivity. These systems bring 
about numerous new “smart” products. A successful example of IoT imple-
mentation can be given in Amsterdam. The Edge is said to be one of the 
most connected office buildings in the world. The building is equipped with 
30,000 sensors, a majority of which are embedded into office lighting. These 
sensors detect the intensity of use of each part of the building and later is 
collected and produced as a heat map so that cleaning personnel can focus 
on more intensely used areas (Deloitte, 2015).
5.6  INDUSTRY 4.0 AND SMART CITIES
Industry 4.0 represents the intelligent production network where machines 
and products communicate with each other without human interaction. The 
development of the industrial internet, wireless systems, cloud systems, sen-
sor networks, autonomous robots, and embedded systems provide an inte-
grated, computer-based environment.
With Industry 4.0, every device produces data and this data is recorded. 
This data needs to be interpreted, classified, and processed into information. 
Only then is it possible to analyse the data obtained from connected devices 
and draw meaningful insights. The data produced with Industry 4.0 contrib-
utes to decision-makers and production processes by passing through data 
mining stages. Industry 4.0, the fourth stage of the industrial revolution, is a 
process that affects all layers of society in many different fields. Within the 
scope of providing certain public services, it is possible to see Industry 4.0 
applications in the management of the production processes of the factories 

Industry 4.0 for smart cities  63
and the provision of some private sector services. Large data sets can be 
queried through the connection of software, cloud computing, machine sen-
sors, and storage systems, and the results can be used as a method to carry 
out the operational processes of the organisation (Gilchrist, 2016). Industry 
is an important part of cities and there is a close relationship between 
Industry 4.0 and smart cities. Smart people, smart economy, smart life, and 
smart governance are among the functions of smart cities. Smart mobility is 
directly related to the purpose of Industry 4.0 to develop autonomous 
indoor vehicles, and the intelligent environment function is directly related 
to the energy efficiency target on which Industry 4.0 is based (Karaköse and 
Yetiş, 2017).
5.7 APPLICATIONS OF AI AND INDUSTRY 4.0 IN SMART 
CITIES
There are many applications of AI and IoT in the context of Industry 4.0 for 
smart cities in literature. These range from healthcare to transportation to 
smart energy management.
In the case of healthcare, Watson Health has developed tools using AI to 
help physicians diagnose brain bleed in patients. AI is also used within cloud 
applications to reduce errors in medical imaging which make up a majority 
of health data. The digitalisation of medical records has also resulted in a 
need for the generation of real-time reports and connectivity among many 
devices (Ghodmare et al., 2021).
Smart transportation for Industry 4.0 factories within smart cities is 
another area where these concepts overlap. In the case of transportation and 
traffic accidents that are a major concern for this concept, AI and IoT can be 
seen to be applied together to minimise such incidents. The use of autono-
mous vehicles will come into play to lower accident rates. An example of 
such an implementation can be seen with Otto, a self-driving truck company 
that has started to use these trucks to provide safer highways. The successful 
application of AI in this industry is crucial to a 700-billion-dollar industry 
in the USA only (Ghodmare et al., 2021).
Many cities around the world are also implementing AI and data-driven 
technology for transportation and traffic management. London and 
Barcelona can be used as examples. London uses such technology to auto-
mate the control of traffic signals based on data collected from sensors 
embedded in traffic lights to reduce traffic congestion. Barcelona uses move-
ment monitoring by using Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors to auto-
mate the flow of public traffic as well as emergency services. The application 
for emergency services uses the GPS to set all lights within the route of the 
emergency vehicle to green, enabling the emergency services to reach their 
destination without being delayed (Bibri and Krogstie, 2020). Other cities 
such as Hong Kong and Istanbul are also utilising data-driven technology to 

64  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
reduce traffic congestion by providing alternative routes for vehicles and 
controlling traffic lights (Gurcan and Dogan, 2017; Office of the Government 
CIO, 2019).
Cities are also trying to adopt smarter means to connect their services 
with citizens. Rio de Janeiro has been increasingly using ICT to bring the 
government closer to its citizens by implementing a Digital Inclusion 
Programme. This programme aims to provide more people with access to 
technology so that they can connect with services strengthening their rela-
tionship with the city and government. They are also developing more web 
portals and online services for citizens to access (Schreiner, 2016).
One of the first cities to be at the forefront of being a smart city is New 
York, one of the largest cities in the USA. Being among the first to act as a 
smart city, New York aims to provide a high-speed broadband internet con-
nection to the entire city by 2025. Therefore, the design of the world’s larg-
est and fastest Wi-Fi network has begun in New York. In addition, a wide 
sensor and camera network has been established to monitor important 
points in New York, where traffic is a major problem. It was stated that with 
these studies, the time spent in traffic was reduced by 10%. New York is one 
of the cities with the highest crime rate. In order to solve this problem, an 
“acoustic gunfire monitoring system” was installed at certain points of the 
city. So, when a gun is fired, this system detects the sound and immediately 
sends a warning to the smartphones of the nearest police officers and directs 
the police there. In addition, smart transportation methods have started to 
be implemented in transportation with active traffic management, special 
access to Citibike bicycles, and smart infrastructure systems such as rainwa-
ter collection and sewage overflow prevention have been developed with the 
LinkNYC green infrastructure programme (Çetin and Çiftçi, 2019).
Another case study of smart city adoption can be seen in the city of 
Santander. Starting in 2010, Santander has based their smart city initiative 
on M2M connectivity allowing the installation of thousands of devices all 
over the city. After the installation of these devices, the city council began 
integrating these technologies into traffic, waste management and other 
public services. In 2013, The Smart Water Project was set to utilise IoT tech-
nology, and a demonstration centre was made open to the public. The sen-
sors installed all around the city of Santander enable the collection of data 
providing the “smartness” aspect to various areas such as transportation 
and mobility, energy efficiency, public safety and the environment (Gutiérrez 
Bayo, 2016).
5.8  DISCUSSION
With the rise of urbanisation and the problems that it brings, many studies 
have been conducted on the concept of smart city to provide solutions to 
these problems.

Industry 4.0 for smart cities  65
As a result of reviewing the current literature on the subject, several areas 
have emerged that use AI and Industry 4.0 technologies within smart city 
development. The major areas can be listed as transportation, healthcare, 
governance, smart homes, agriculture, smart grid, and waste management. 
Studies such as that of Agarwal et al. (2015) state that AI is especially impor-
tant in the case of smart transportation in which it can provide a solution to 
problems on a larger scale as well as provide real-time reports and forecast-
ing. AI can also be used to ease traffic congestion. There are also other areas 
that AI can be applied to such as health and living. Nowadays, AI is used to 
assist with medical diagnosis as well as an intricate part of robotic opera-
tions. The use of AI is also increasing as people are purchasing smart appli-
ances to make their homes smarter (Voda and Radu, 2018).
5.8.1 Transportation
Transportation is undeniably one of the major areas of the smart city con-
cept. It can be understood that many applications are developed using AI 
to reduce traffic congestion. Large cities such as London, Hong Kong, and 
Istanbul where traffic congestion is a major problem have already imple-
mented such solutions to their traffic monitoring systems. Other applica-
tions have been developed to make predictions based on data collected from 
various devices. These predictions are used in smart routing, parking prob-
lems and general traffic flow.
Several studies (Kamel Boulos and Al-Shorbaji, 2014; Bing et al., 2011; 
Hause and Hummell, 2016; Masek et al., 2016; Sakhardande et al., 2016) 
demonstrate how IoT may be utilised in transportation to provide intelli-
gent parking, create innovative routing services, ensure intelligent vehicle 
tracking, and increase security by using road sensors or RFID. Furthermore, 
other studies (Behrendt, 2016; Tsaramirsis et al., 2016) show how IoT tech-
nology can reduce pollution, improve people’s mobility, and save lives.
5.8.2  Healthcare
Healthcare is another major area that has been studied within the litera-
ture. It is also the area with the most applications (Ben Rjab and Mellouli, 
2019). AI can be seen to be used in the identification of various diseases 
by improving data analysis and prediction algorithms. Again, AI can help 
in the medical decision-making process by helping analyse data collected 
from various platforms and devices. AI and data-driven technologies have 
been used increasingly especially over the last two years given the Covid-19 
pandemic. The mass accumulation of real-time data and the need to provide 
fast and accurate results regarding the contamination of people and spread 
of the virus have proven vital for the safety and well-being of humanity.
Several studies (Islam et al., 2015; Bhatt et al., 2017) emphasise the rele-
vance of IoT in this field. In this context, IoT technology is used in remote 

66  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
patient monitoring, real-time data collection on medical conditions, patient 
location, and improved patient safety.
5.8.3  Smart home
IoT is used in smart homes to connect and control all entities in a home. 
Smart appliances and devices are used to improve surveillance and security, 
provide temperature control, detect risks, and ensure connectivity by way of 
a network (Darianian and Michael, 2008; Bregman, 2010; Bing et al., 2011; 
Gubbi et al., 2013; Skouby and Lynggaard, 2014; Zanella et al., 2014; 
Jaradat et al., 2015; Hui et al., 2017). AI enables various home devices to 
communicate with each other and identify the needs of the residents by col-
lecting data such as temperature and security level.
5.8.4 Agriculture
AI is being utilised within agriculture to optimise inputs and outputs as well 
as to automate various processes by collecting and analysing data. AI also 
assists in the decrease of water usage subsequently increasing the efficiency 
of agricultural resources.
5.8.5  Electricity supply
The concept of smart grid and smart metres enables the collection of elec-
tricity consumption data from various locations be it public or private. This 
data, with the aid of AI, can provide a means to estimate energy consump-
tion and adjust accordingly.
5.8.6 Waste management
The main use of AI in the area of waste management is to automate tasks 
such as the collection and recycling of waste.
IoT is an overlapping feature in both Industry 4.0 and smart city. There 
are many applications of IoT in smart cities within the literature. IoT and AI 
are currently popular research topics due to recent industry accomplish-
ments and have proven to provide better results in many fields such as waste 
management, public surveillance, asset monitoring, factory automation, and 
weather monitoring. The combination of IoT and AI is a powerful technique 
for the smart enhancement of IS.
The combination of IoT and AI has the potential to replace traditional 
management methods. The notion of smart is no longer restricted to intel-
ligence but completely encompasses the cooperation of users, thanks to 
technological advancements and increased awareness among smart city citi-
zens. Not only does the form of engagement include public cooperation, but 
it also includes decision-making. Decisions must be made quickly and

effectively, often relying on real-time data and changes in citizen behaviour 
(Appleton, 2021). Because of the rise of cloud computing, AI algorithms are 
catching the attention of a variety of businesses, including smart city 
research. Different countries and cities are in different stages of adoption 
right now (Gao and Yi, 2021); therefore, they have different levels of 
adoption.
Both AI and IoT are powerful technologies in their own right. IoT has 
enabled smart city apps to have comprehensive monitoring of urban activi-
ties, as well as the ability to remotely track and optimise their systems and 
assets. That was and still is ground-breaking; nevertheless, making sense of 
the massive volumes of data collected by sensors remains a daunting prob-
lem. This is where AI comes into play (Kuguoglu et al., 2021). Smart city 
applications can reduce unexpected downtime and increase operational effi-
ciency by combining AI’s capacity to swiftly extract insights from data pro-
duced by the massive network of connected devices. Simply said, IoT serves 
as a digital nervous system, with AI serving as the decision-making brain. AI 
demands a large amount of data. Fortunately, IoT creates a lot of it (Scholl 
and AlAwadhi, 2015).
The existent literature states that several roles can be understood as ben-
efits of AI within the concept of smart cities. These are improving 
­decision-making, processing large amounts of data, improving interaction 
with people, industrial automation, monitoring, and environmental 
improvements.
The increased utilisation of AI although pivotal to the development of 
smart cities also comes with many challenges. These challenges can be sum-
marised as follows: problems arising with the collection of data. Data may 
not be readily available and may be hard to interpret. Another challenge is 
the correct design of AI algorithms. AI in the context of smart cities makes 
for very complex algorithms which are harder to design and manage. Finally, 
where there is data collection and connectivity, there are many ethical and 
legal issues that follow (Rjab and Mellouli, 2018).
5.9  CONCLUSION
The Industry 4.0 integration to smart cities is increasing efficiently along 
with the use of enabling technologies such as IoT, AI, and cloud computing. 
These technologies provide a more flexible way of developing and improv-
ing smart cities. The use of AI within smart cities will continue in the future 
(Becic, 2020).
The last point of the developments in digital technologies, smart cities, 
and the use of smart technologies in solving local problems have created 
opportunities such as meeting the expectations and demands of the citizens 
quickly and on the spot, strengthening participatory democracy, and ensur-
ing that local governments can be managed in a transparent and 

68  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
accountable manner. Smart city applications also provide major benefits in 
the matter of using public resources effectively and efficiently. In this respect, 
local government organisations in different countries are in search of how 
they can use the big data collected with various sensors and tools more 
effectively in the solution of urban problems, the delivery of services and the 
participation of stakeholders, with the help of smart technologies, going 
beyond the classical e-municipal practices. However, it should be underlined 
that fully implementing smart city functions is a very arduous process. While 
the advantages it offers are quite attractive for local governments and city 
residents, a series of technical, managerial, economic, and social problems 
need to be solved. The creation of smart cities of the future, first of all, 
requires a governance approach based on the cooperation of many actors 
consisting of the informatics sector, the state, local governments, and the 
city’s stakeholders. In addition, while developing smart city policies, it is 
necessary to consider many factors such as technological problems, data 
security, confidentiality of private data, high costs, qualified manpower, ser-
vice users, and the level of technology adoption by stakeholders. As a result, 
despite the significant increase in academic, political, and social interest in 
smart cities, it is important for governments and city administrations to 
make good use of their existing resources, to create holistic plans and pro-
grammes, and to make cost-effectiveness analyses in determining smart city 
policies and strategies.
It can be stated that enabling technologies such as AI and IoT are vital for 
the development of smart cities (Ahad et al., 2020). AI is a potential driving 
force for the rise of quality of life within urban areas around the world. 
However, the use of such a powerful technology comes with its fair share of 
risks and should be designed and implemented accordingly.
This chapter has provided insight into the studies regarding Industry 4.0 
and AI in the context of smart cities and has acknowledged the benefit of AI 
and how this technology can be a driving force that will revolutionise fur-
ther development of smart cities around the globe.

6.1  INTRODUCTION
With the innovations brought by technology, the use of many machines such 
as light rail train sets, buses, and cable cars are increasing day by day in 
transportation as in almost every field. With these machines, it is very easy 
to reach from one end of the cities, which have very wide borders in terms of 
the settlement, to the other end. However, the number of other vehicles par-
ticipating in the transportation network as well as a large number of public 
vehicles or narrow roads causes an increase in traffic in the city. Individuals 
who want to provide transportation due to increasing traffic can spend a 
large part of their time on the roads. Considering that the individual has a 
physical disability in the increasing traffic, it is clearly seen that transporta-
tion will become an inextricable situation for that individual. In order to 
minimize the time spent by both healthy individuals and disabled individu-
als in traffic, it is essential that the transportation network operates in a 
very coordinated manner. Today, thanks to technology, machines’ ability to 
perceive their environment with the help of sensors and communicate via 
the internet has given them a sense of self. By equipping the machines used 
in transportation with various sensors and communication infrastructures, 
the time spent in traffic can be shortened, and the unproductive time spent 
by both healthy individuals and disabled individuals during transportation 
can be minimized. This is possible with the use of intelligent transportation 
systems in the city. In this chapter, the basic building blocks of intelligent 
transportation systems are examined, the necessary building blocks for the

transportation to be described as “intelligent” are mentioned, the place of 
the physically disabled individuals in transportation is examined and the 
advantages that Intelligent Transportation Applications will bring to the 
physically disabled individuals and the barrier-free intelligent transporta-
tion systems used today are examined.
6.2  STRUCTURE, CONTENT AND BASIC BUILDING 
BLOCKS OF SMART TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
6.2.1  Urban transportation in traditional cities
Thanks to the economic and technological developments brought by the 
21st century, the life opportunities offered by the cities have gradually 
increased. This situation has led to migration from small cities to developed 
cities. As a result of this population increase in both developed and develop-
ing cities and the resulting increased vehicle use and unplanned urbanization 
in cities, traffic problems have emerged in urban transportation. In addition, 
traffic density peaks at certain times during the day, and the time spent in 
traffic increases gradually. If the short definition of transportation is evalu-
ated as “the displacement of goods or people and its organization (Abbasgil, 
1994), it can be seen that this organization becomes more difficult day by 
day depending on the traffic density.
The basis of transportation consists of four building blocks. These can be 
classified as road, air, sea and railway. However, among these building 
blocks, intercity or intercountry transportation is in question. Although the 
subject of transportation is divided into four groups in general terms, it is 
possible to divide the urban transportation into three groups as follows 
(Murat and Şahin, 2010):
	•	 Individual transportation
	•	 Intermediate public transport transportation
	•	 Public transport
Individual transportation can be said to meet the need for private transpor-
tation with one’s own means, apart from the public transportation system 
in the city. In this type of transportation, the vehicle to be traveled, the 
duration and route of the journey are left to the person’s request. Although 
people are free in individual transportation, when the number of people 
who prefer this type of transportation increases, they become dependent on 
other users for time due to the traffic that will occur.
In intermediate public transportation systems, the person does not have a 
private vehicle to reach; in addition, he does not use public transportation 
when he wants to provide transportation. Instead of public transportation, 
people can meet their transportation needs by taxi or minibus. There is no 

78  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
order in this transportation system. A person can reach the desired location 
by using someone else’s transportation vehicle (Ağaoğlu and Başdemir, 
2019).
Public transportation systems, on the other hand, consist of vehicles mov-
ing on fixed routes offered by the city administration to the public. In a 
more detailed way, public transportation can be defined as “systems that are 
coordinated with or independently of other transportation vehicles in traf-
fic, stopping at certain stops at certain times and routes for a predetermined 
fee of all individuals living in the city” (Murat and Şahin, 2010).
The increasing population density and, accordingly, the increase in the 
number of vehicles participating in the traffic negatively affect the time 
spent in transportation, whether the individual provides transportation in 
the city with his own means or makes use of intermediate public transporta-
tion or public transportation systems. In order to minimize the time spent in 
traffic, the use of public transport should be expanded and coordinated as 
best as possible. This harmony can be achieved very well with the Information 
and Communication Technologies offered by today’s technology. The trans-
portation systems used in the city can be transformed into “smart” by using 
technology. The effective, healthy, reliable, fast, accessible and economical 
public transportation services offered by the city administration in the city 
allow people to turn to public transportation. This is possible with a smart 
transportation application. With a smart transportation system, people can 
be directed to public transportation in the city and the number of private 
vehicles that will join the traffic can be minimized, thus reducing the time 
spent in transportation.
6.2.1.1  Population density and traffic in traditional cities
Almost all of the individuals living in the big cities of the world want their 
cities to be rebuilt due to the rapid increase in population density, to manage 
their cities with a more livable, cheaper and more accessible city approach 
and to make investments in this direction (Harmon et al., 2015). In order to 
realize this understanding, either physical changes must be made in the city 
or Information and Communication Technologies must be used.
Physical systems are typically constituents of traditional cities. The physi-
cal systems that make up a city can be listed as infrastructure and super-
structures, buildings, railways, networks with electricity–water–natural gas 
distribution, and roads that provide transportation. The number of city 
facilities needed as a function of the city population can be calculated 
approximately as follows:

Here Nf is the number of facilities, Np is the city population, Rp is the 
annual population growth rate, D is the number of days per year, Nc is the 
number of people per hour, and H is the number of hours per day (Mohanty 
et al., 2016). As can be seen from the formula, as the population of the city 
increases, the number of facilities needed by the people of the city will 
increase, and as a result, the need for transportation to these facilities will 
also increase. All this coordinated increase will reduce the manageability of 
the city and increase the problems experienced by the people of the city, 
especially in transportation. Both the manageability of the city and the coor-
dination of transportation can be made easier by using Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs). ICTs infrastructure is the basic smart 
component that connects all the components that make up the city, from 
traffic density to electricity–water–natural gas distribution, and essentially 
acts as the nervous system of smart cities (Mohanty et al., 2016).
A system called City Core by Calderoni et al. is a good example for ICTs 
systems. In the City Core system, many information from the lighting sys-
tems used in the city to the density in the assembly areas, from the traffic 
jam to the safety of the individuals in the public areas, were collected 
through sensors. The obtained information was transferred to a cloud sys-
tem using the Internet of Things (IoTs). Afterward, the data collected in the 
cloud system was processed, resulting in a more manageable and safer city 
structure (Calderoni et al., 2014).
Smart city systems are systems that can be integrated into existing infra-
structure and superstructure systems in traditional cities. These systems can 
be a solution to the problems of the people of the city at many points, from 
landscaping to water–electricity–natural gas distribution, from traffic jams 
to public transportation. Although there are advantages in many different 
areas that smart cities can offer to the people of the city, it is seen that the 
most popular investments are investments in traffic congestion and improv-
ing the management of urban public transportation systems.
6.2.1.2  Problems experienced in traditional urban 
transportation
Increasing mechanization from the industrial revolution to the present has 
produced solutions not only in industry but also in the needs of the people 
of the city. In this context, heavy-duty machines such as asphalt machines, 
environmental cleaning machines, mixers, garbage collection vehicles, 
spraying machines, trucks and shovel loader used in infrastructure and 
superstructure works; a wide variety of machinery equipment such as light 
rail systems, buses, and cable cars developed for transportation needs were 
produced. Although local governments want to respond to the needs of the 
people of the city in a short time by using these tools, today this request is 
negatively affected due to population density.

80  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
The performance of local government officials in the city administration is 
not measured only by the machinery and equipment resources of the city 
today. Availability and quality of information communication and social 
infrastructure also creates positive discrimination in management approach. 
Investments made by local governments in social infrastructure and informa-
tion and communication technologies also reveal urban competition, and the 
size of the investments plays a decisive role in this competition. The concept 
of “smart city” has emerged in order to respond to the needs of the people of 
the city in a short time and to create a competitive management approach 
among the city administrations. The Smart City has been developing for the 
last 30 years as a strategic tool in which the city administration uses 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) against the service 
demand of the city people (Caragliu et al., 2011). The most popular of the 
components that make up a smart city are smart transportation applications.
In traditional cities, transportation is by individual vehicles such as bicy-
cles, motorcycles and automobiles; it can be done by public transportation 
vehicles such as taxi, minibus or by public transportation vehicles such as 
bus, cable car, tram, metro. Especially at the start and end times of working 
days, the transportation needs of the people of the city reach their peak. 
During these hours, the number of vehicles participating in the traffic 
increases rapidly and the time spent in transportation increases in a direct 
proportion accordingly. Traffic and time spent in transportation are not the 
only problems experienced in urban transportation. The disadvantages of 
transportation in big cities can be listed as follows:
	•	 The increase in the number of vehicles participating in the traffic due 
to the population growth and the prolongation of the transportation 
time accordingly
	•	 The increase in noise pollution in the city with the increase in the num-
ber of vehicles participating in the traffic
	•	 The increase in air pollution in the city with the increase in exhaust 
emission values
	•	 Due to irregularities in public transportation vehicles, people tend to 
use individual vehicles and accordingly increase in energy consumption
	•	 The vehicle that wants to leave the traffic as a result of not having 
enough parking space is still stuck in traffic
	•	 People who want to use public transportation cannot reach enough 
stops and vehicles, and the need for transportation is interrupted.
Thanks to the developing technology, the possibility of machines to per-
ceive their surroundings and interact with each other has also emerged. 
The increase in the use of these technologies in sectors such as industry, 
agriculture and animal husbandry, and aviation has allowed these appli-
cations to be used in areas where the human mind cannot reach or the 
workforce is lacking. Lightless factories would be a very good example for 

Smart transportation for disabilities  81
this situation. Robots used in unlit factories communicate with each other 
and work within a certain process, and the human-sourced workforce is 
drawn through the industry. In this way, the amount of production per unit 
time increases considerably compared to the previous one, and worker or 
human-induced errors are reduced to almost zero. In this case, the produc-
tion efficiency increases and the amount and quality of the product pro-
duced per unit time progresses (Uzun and Hakverdi, 2019).
Autonomous vehicles, whose technology is developing rapidly and which 
are subject to very high investments in the world, will also be a good exam-
ple in this context. Thanks to driverless vehicle technology, a vehicle 
equipped with artificial intelligence can determine the shortest route and 
roads with the least traffic that can take its passengers to where they want 
to reach. In order to determine these routes, it communicates with the vehi-
cles or machines around the autonomous vehicle and shapes its own trans-
portation targets thanks to this communication. Thus, the time people spend 
in traffic can be reduced. The real attraction of autonomous vehicle technol-
ogy can be noticed at this point. A machine that will use the precious time 
for living things very efficiently in traffic is a valuable technology for every-
one (Uzun and Hakverdi, 2019).
Integrating the advantages of this rapid development in technology into 
urban transportation will enable to eliminate the problems experienced in 
transportation to a large extent and to achieve great success, especially in 
the coordination of public transportation systems. With the integration of 
ICTs technologies into transportation, both public transportation systems 
and traffic congestion can be managed intelligently.
6.2.2 The place of artificial intelligence in intelligent 
transportation systems
Today, many of the developing big cities are faced with important problems 
such as traffic, transportation and logistics due to the rapidly increasing 
population and the increase in the number of vehicles.
Technology can be a tremendous help to efficiently create and manage a 
sustainable transport system. While struggling with urban traffic problems, 
it is necessary to design a sustainable and effective transportation system. 
Artificial intelligence technologies that provide traffic flow planning and 
analysis by using real-time information obtained from vehicles are used for 
an efficient and rational traffic management system.
Artificial intelligence-assisted decision-making, forecasting, traffic man-
agement, analysis, vehicle routing, transportation optimization and secure 
synchronization of vehicles play an important role in ensuring an efficient 
traffic management. Among the methods that support intelligent transporta-
tion, there are a number of artificial intelligence methods such as Genetic 
Algorithms, Heuristics, Metaheuristics, Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy 
Logic and Simulated Annealing. By using these methods, transportation 

82  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
congestion is eliminated in a rational way. In addition, transportation time, 
fuel economy and system productivity are significantly optimized.
6.2.3  Urban transportation in smart cities
Social services offered to the public in the city; The whole of the systems 
consisting of sensors and electronic communication cards integrated into the 
existing infrastructure to connect electricity, water, natural gas distribution 
services, environmental cleaning and regulation services, public transporta-
tion services and bureaucratic services related to city administration with 
the internet defines the concept of Smart City. Thanks to the internet and 
electronic cards, all these services become more accessible (Hakverdi, 2021). 
Here, the inclusion of electronic circuits using ICTs technologies and sensors 
working in harmony with these circuits in the existing city infrastructure is 
a must for the Smart City. In short, what makes a smart city smart is not the 
demolition and rebuilding of the existing system, but the integration of ICTs 
technologies into the existing system.
Light rail system technologies in urban transportation and transporta-
tion, road vehicles with air tires and vehicles used in sea transportation have 
been serving the people of the city for many years. These vehicles, which we 
can describe as traditional transportation vehicles, make transportation 
within the city very easy (Mohanty et al., 2016). The increase in these vehi-
cles used in traditional transportation compared to the population brings 
along the problem of traffic density. The search for solutions to traffic den-
sity started in the last quarter of the twentieth century, in the 1980s. As a 
solution, the first applications appear in the form of systems in which radio 
broadcasting is used (Maimaris and Papageorgiou, 2016). Today, a solution 
is sought for traffic jams with ICTs systems. ICTs systems consist of elec-
tronic boards and sensor applications. These systems are more rational and 
innovative than systems using radio broadcasts.
The purpose of intelligent transportation systems is to minimize the time 
spent in transportation by creating a solution to the traffic density in the 
city. Intelligent transportation systems generally contain electronic card sys-
tems that can transfer data via the internet, sensors that can work in har-
mony with these card systems, and software that acts as communication 
between both systems. Intelligent transportation systems do not change the 
existing traffic network structure and infrastructure in the city, they are 
included in the existing system to prevent traffic congestion and ensure that 
vehicles in traffic reach their destinations in the shortest way.
6.2.3.1  Intelligent transportation systems overview and IoT
Intelligent transportation systems provide transportation vehicles to users 
with short messages for non-smart phones and internet-based mobile appli-
cations for smart phones (Bélissent, 2010). Intelligent transportation systems 

Smart transportation for disabilities  83
have functionality in many areas, especially in regulating public transporta-
tion and eliminating traffic density.
Almost all of today’s intelligent transportation systems consist of geo-
graphical location markers (GPS) integrated into the transportation vehicle 
and electronic cards that can use the IoTs. These electronic cards can be 
equipped with many features, and the GPS and IoT accesses of the cards are 
essential for intelligent transportation systems.
The first steps of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) were taken with 
NAVSTAR (Navigation System Using Time and Ranging) GPS satellites 
developed by the US Department of Defense (Karaali and Yıldırım, 1996). 
The main purpose of the system is to detect the geographical location of any 
person or object. In intelligent transportation systems, it is possible to obtain 
the location and speed data of the vehicles with GPS.
After the developments in the concept of the IoTs, the acceleration in the 
number of machines described as “Smart” is increasing day by day. So much 
so that the machines that use cables to transfer data with the internet got rid 
of the cable mess and found the opportunity to communicate wirelessly with 
other machines that are far away from themselves. This communication of 
machines can be compared to people using social media and social media 
tools today. In this example, the internet networks that machines communi-
cate with represent social media tools, and machines represent people. With 
the help of social media, people can collect and evaluate written and visual 
information from each other via the internet. In the same way, machines can 
access the information they need from the other machine or from a cloud 
system where the information is stored beforehand, and can take action by 
compiling the information they access in their own memory.
In general, there are electronic cards that can use GPS and IoT data on 
transportation vehicles equipped with today’s intelligent transportation sys-
tems. With the help of GPS, the smart transportation vehicle obtains the 
information about its own location and speed as well as the location and 
speed of other vehicles. This information is accessed with the help of IoT. 
The smart transportation vehicle, which obtains the aforementioned data, 
takes a decision to reach its route in a short and easy way and either takes 
action or informs its user in line with the decision (Arasteh et al., 2016).
6.2.3.2  Benefits and purpose of intelligent transportation systems
Intelligent transportation systems aim to provide benefits to the people who 
use the system by creating their own decision mechanism through various 
data such as the location, speed and traffic density of the vehicles. These 
benefits can be listed as follows:
	•	 To meet the transportation needs of those who have a disadvantage by 
including the elderly, disabled, pregnant and similar people in public 
transportation in a short time

84  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	•	 To reduce the rate of injury and death in possible accident situations 
by reducing traffic
	•	 To make the transportation system more manageable
	•	 To resolve uncertainties and sudden densities during transportation 
faster, more practically and with less cost.
6.2.3.3  Fundamentals of transition from traditional to 
intelligent transportation in the city
In order for a smart transportation application to be considered smart, it 
must offer certain services to its users. Although these services differ from 
application to application, there are some features that a smart trans-
portation application must have. These features can be listed as follows 
(Engelbrecht et al., 2015):
	•	 The accessibility service for public transportation should be kept at 
the highest level.
	•	 The user should be able to access any data about transportation easily.
	•	 The systems to be used when transforming the traditional transpor-
tation system in the city into a smart transportation system should 
definitely be integrated into the existing system, and the infrastructure 
should not be changed.
	•	 The IoTs should be used mostly as a communication tool.
6.2.3.4  Examples of urban intelligent transportation systems 
used in the world
In the face of overpopulation in cities, both the number of private vehicles 
participating in traffic and the number of vehicles such as buses, trains, 
trams and cable cars that serve people who will meet their transportation 
needs with public transportation in the city are increasing. The increase 
in the number of mentioned vehicles also causes traffic density. Since the 
mid-1900s, the search for solutions to the increasing traffic congestion has 
begun. Today, these searches emerge as more rational and innovative sys-
tems using electronic sensors and IoT-based systems.
Applications known as Electronic Route Guidance System used in 
America in 1969, Comprehensive Automobile Management System used in 
Japan in 1973, and finally Driver Radio Broadcast Information System in 
Germany in 1974 can be considered the first and basic examples of intelli-
gent transportation systems (Tokuyama, 1996). The aforementioned sys-
tems are systems based on giving information about the traffic flow on the 
crowded roads of cities to vehicle drivers over a radio broadcast. Comparing 
the intelligent transportation systems, which use internet connection, GPS 

Smart transportation for disabilities  85
and cloud data as a communication tool, and the first systems using radio 
frequencies, it is seen that the systems using radio frequencies are primitive 
and simple systems.
In a study by Alam et al., traffic density was tried to be eliminated with 
sensors placed on the roads. In this context, traffic density depending on the 
number of vehicles was detected with various sensors and drivers were 
warned and directed to different roads (Alam et al., 2016).
In a study by Bojan et al. in 2014, urban public transportation systems 
were discussed. In the study, vehicles such as buses, trains, trams and cable 
cars used for transportation in the city were equipped with GPS, tempera-
ture sensors and humidity sensors, and these sensors were enabled to read 
and write data to the cloud system with an internet connection. Information 
about the reading time of the Near Field Communication (NFC) card sys-
tems used to collect fares in the vehicles, the temperature and humidity sen-
sors placed inside the vehicle, the density information in the vehicle and the 
location of the vehicle with the GPS system were obtained. By reading the 
data obtained, the density on the line where the vehicle is located was deter-
mined and additional vehicles were directed accordingly (Bojan et al., 2014).
In another application called CHIMERA, it is mentioned that even if the 
traffic density is detected and the vehicles participating in the traffic are 
diverted to different roads, when the number of vehicles participating in the 
traffic is high enough, traffic congestion will occur on the routed roads and 
this congestion will create an unsolvable node. The solution to this problem 
is to provide a real-time estimation of the traffic density that may occur on 
the roads, before the density occurs, and to direct the vehicles to different 
roads before there is a traffic jam (Souza et al., 2016).
Another study that can be evaluated within the scope of intelligent trans-
portation systems is based on GPS signals. By combining the GPS systems 
placed in the vehicles and the location information that the driver wants to 
reach, it is ensured that the driver reaches his destination by the shortest 
route by constantly updating the map information in real time (Pan et al., 
2012). Today, it has gained popularity thanks to the map applications on 
smartphones.
Brennand et al. developed a system that proposes to distribute traffic den-
sity in city centers similar to tree branches. According to this system, traffic 
density data at vehicle locations are used to enable vehicles to exit traffic 
similar to tree branches (Brennand et al., 2015).
In another proposed system, an application written for the smartphone of 
the vehicle driver was mentioned. When a driver of a vehicle with this appli-
cation wants to park his vehicle, he notifies the application of this request. 
The software in the application uses GPS signals to determine the distances 
to the parking areas that have been previously processed into its map data. 
The vacant status data in the parking areas equipped with various sensors is 
received by the application via IoT. The driver is directed to the nearest 
parking area where the vehicle can park in light of all the information 

86  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
obtained. In this way, the vehicle that wants to park will get out of the traffic 
as soon as possible and the traffic density will be relieved to some extent 
(Sherly and Somasundareswari, 2015).
Hsu et al. proposed an Intelligent Transportation System that aims to 
minimize carbon dioxide emissions due to traffic density. According to this 
system, by using machine vision algorithms, information about the waiting 
times of the vehicles in traffic, braking events and waiting times at the traffic 
light was obtained and they attempted to predict the shortest route for eco-
nomical driving (Hsu et al., 2015).
6.2.3.5  Convenience of intelligent transportation systems
The most important innovation brought by smart transportation systems 
is to find solutions to traffic jams. Preventing the increasing traffic will also 
reduce the negative effects such as accidents, loss of time and environmental 
pollution. In addition to all these, other conveniences brought by intelligent 
transportation systems can be listed as follows:
	•	 The regularity of public transport and, accordingly, the reduction of 
time spent in traffic
	•	 Ensuring energy saving
	•	 Reduction of wear and maintenance costs in transportation vehicles
	•	 Easier activation of the action plan in an emergency that may occur in 
the city
	•	 Obtaining extra public safety if transportation data is obtained 
through cameras.
6.2.4  Comparison of traditional transportation and 
intelligent transportation used in the city
The most important thing that distinguishes smart cities from traditional 
cities is the use of Information and Communication Technologies. ICTs sys-
tems facilitate access to services offered to the public in smart cities via 
mobile phones, computers or the Internet. The most essential component of 
a smart city is its use of ICTs systems. Apart from that, the concepts of smart 
city and traditional city can be compared as listed below:
	•	 Access to services in traditional cities is more difficult than in smart 
cities.
	•	 Transportation in cities using smart systems is easier than in tradi-
tional cities.
	•	 Public transport systems are more manageable in smart cities.
	•	 Cities that invest in smart systems are greener. If traffic management is 
taken as an example, air and noise pollution is less in smart cities due 
to the number of vehicles used.

Smart transportation for disabilities  87
	•	 Smart cities are more manageable.
	•	 Life in smart cities is more economical than in traditional cities.
	•	 Smart cities follow technology closely, while traditional cities lack 
technology.
6.3 TRANSPORTATION OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS IN 
THE CITY
Both the economic and socio-cultural opportunities offered by urban life 
increase the migration from small settlements to large settlements. Due to 
the increasing immigration, the city population is increasing and urban 
transportation problems are manifesting themselves. Both the time spent 
by the people of the city in traffic and the inability to find a means of 
transportation cause transportation disruption. In this context, units 
responsible for urban public transportation should regulate transporta-
tion coordination.
In particular, the transportation systems used by the majority of the soci-
ety and designed uniformly should be designed for the use of disabled peo-
ple and the existing transportation infrastructure should be revised in a way 
that will meet the transportation needs of the disabled people.
6.3.1  Individuals with disabilities in urban 
transportation
All infrastructure and superstructure units in public, social, or individual 
living spaces and the transportation systems in smart cities are generally 
designed by taking into account the majority group of the society. This situ-
ation stands out as a barrier in terms of accessibility in front of disabled 
individuals in the society, both in transportation and in other issues. In most 
countries of the world, social living spaces and transportation systems are 
designed in accordance with the use of disabled individuals, and even if 
the design is developed for disabled individuals, it cannot be carried out in 
a regular way. This situation causes the disabled person to not be able to 
benefit from social and individual rights. Thus, it emerges as a deprivation 
of rights for the disabled person. The concept of accessibility, which was 
put forward to eliminate the aforementioned deprivation, means that all 
segments of the society can benefit from all areas of life, access the services 
offered by the public and benefit from them in a way that will provide the 
highest benefit (Tiyek et al., 2016). Transportation and the use of public 
transportation, which are among the basic rights of disabled people as well 
as all segments of the society, have mostly been studied in the international 
literature. As the comfort level, awareness and technological advances of 
societies increase, studies on accessibility for individuals with disabilities 
have accelerated (Özispa and Arabelen, 2020).

88  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
The number and equipment of vehicles such as buses, subways, trams, 
and cable cars used in urban transportation play an important role in ensur-
ing smooth transportation. Individuals who do not have a private vehicle in 
the city or do not want to use their private vehicle for various reasons turn 
to urban public transportation vehicles offered by the local government to 
meet their transportation needs. This trend rises to very high levels on cer-
tain days and times of the week, such as the start and end times of working 
hours. As the number of people living in big cities increases, efficiency in 
meeting transportation needs decreases depending on the number of vehi-
cles and equipment. As a result, the time spent by people in need of trans-
portation in traffic is prolonged, and this causes negativities such as nerves, 
stress and loss of time in people. In transportation systems where transpor-
tation irregularity and equipment are insufficient, waiting times of people at 
stops can be quite long. In addition to this long period, transportation dif-
ficulties become a problem that cannot be ignored if the individual has a 
physical disability. It is difficult for the disabled person who wants to have 
transportation in the city to find a vehicle with special machinery and equip-
ment. Even if these vehicles are available, the time spent by the individual in 
transportation increases due to the fact that these vehicles are usually full. In 
addition to all these, the fact that the personnel responsible for the vehicle 
does not fulfill their responsibilities toward the disabled with good or bad 
intentions drags the transportation into an inextricable situation for the dis-
abled. In addition, at the beginning and end of working hours, at the peak 
of traffic density and transportation need, the inadequacy of transportation 
for the disabled reaches the highest level. Considering the place of disabled 
people in transportation, it is obvious how big a problem transportation 
poses for them. In addition to this problem, the inability of the disabled 
individual who cannot meet the transportation needs he expects to have 
access to social life and lead a life away from people will negatively affect 
the idea of eliminating social class differences.
6.3.2  Places disabled people want to reach mostly in 
the city
Considering the advantages it offers, city life has brought population den-
sity with it. Population density, on the other hand, has triggered the expan-
sion of urban construction and living spaces to much wider regions. Spatial 
growth and development, on the other hand, caused the distances between 
residential areas to lengthen, and thus, the urban transportation network 
gradually expanded. The expanding transportation network has become 
more difficult to manage, and transportation costs have increased with the 
time spent in traffic. All these have caused environmental pollution and 
noise in the city.
Although negative situations are encountered, transportation is one of the 
most important building blocks of urban life. As with healthy individuals, 

Smart transportation for disabilities  89
people with physical disabilities also use the urban transportation system to 
access workplaces, residences, social and cultural areas and hospitals in the 
city. While the inadequacies in the transportation system pose great prob-
lems even for healthy individuals, the difficulties experienced by an indi-
vidual with a physical disability in meeting their transportation needs can be 
seen by everyone. In this context, the special situations of disabled people 
should not be ignored while designing and implementing transportation sys-
tems in the city. Transportation systems should be designed according to the 
problems that disabled people may experience in transportation or updates 
should be made to existing transportation systems.
6.3.3  Problems of disabled people in urban 
transportation
The population density in developed cities of countries around the world is 
increasing day by day due to many different reasons. Increasing population 
density creates negativities in most parts of the city. One of these negativities 
is the disruptions experienced in the need for urban transportation, which is 
desired to be provided by both private vehicles and public transportation. In 
direct proportion to the increasing number of people, the number of people 
who want to provide transportation, the number of vehicles participating in 
the traffic and the time spent in traffic also increase. This situation obliges 
the units responsible for urban transportation to carry out their work in a 
certain order. The time spent on transportation, which will be provided by 
both private vehicles and urban public transportation, is of great importance 
for the people of the city. The length of the said period is directly related to 
the local government’s attitude toward transportation. Local governments 
using up-to-date and innovative systems in transportation can significantly 
reduce traffic time.
Urban public transport services are generally coordinated by units respon-
sible for local governments. The adequacy of the vehicles used in urban 
transportation in terms of number and equipment affects the time spent by 
people in transportation positively or negatively. While the length of the 
mentioned period is very important for all segments of society, it is clear that 
transportation will be very difficult and troublesome for the disabled per-
son, considering that the person who wants to provide transportation has a 
physical disability.
Some difficulties experienced by a disabled person in meeting their trans-
portation needs can be mentioned. At the beginning of these difficulties is 
the transportation vehicles that do not have specially produced equipment 
for the disabled person. Even if the individual wants to meet his transporta-
tion with public transportation, he may not be able to meet his needs due to 
vehicles that do not have the necessary equipment. The use of equipped 
vehicles in transportation should not be seen as a sufficient means of trans-
portation for the disabled individual. Because the said vehicle may come to 

90  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
the stops full, or the disabled person may not be able to find the help they 
need to get on the vehicle by the personnel in charge of the vehicle. In addi-
tion to the first negativities that come to mind, other problems experienced 
by the disabled person in transportation can be listed as follows:
	•	 Stress experienced by the disabled person due to lack of information in 
the travel planning process as a result of deficiencies and disruptions in 
the travel information system.
	•	 Absence of auditory or visual information signs in these areas while 
waiting for transportation vehicles such as stops and stations.
	•	 Difficult to reach areas such as stops and stations.
	•	 The need for personnel support when getting on or off public transport.
	•	 When the disabled person cannot get help from the public transport 
personnel, he has to ask for help from foreigners.
	•	 Lack of equipment such as elevators and ramps for disabled people in 
public transportation vehicles.
	•	 Lack of equipment to take safety precautions such as seat belts and 
wheelchair fixation apparatus for disabled people in public transpor-
tation vehicles.
	•	 Lack of sufficient audio or visual information and direction signs in 
public transportation vehicles.
6.3.4 The place of the disabled in traditional urban 
transportation systems
In a study conducted by Cakir in 2015, it was stated that disabled individu-
als were also taken into account in the coordination of transportation in a 
city in Turkey. According to the study, it was mentioned that the transporta-
tion vehicles with the necessary equipment for the disabled people are in the 
majority in the city, but there are vehicles that do not have these equipment. 
In addition, it was also mentioned in the same study that equipped vehicles 
arrive late at the stops and that disabled individuals can wait at the stops for 
quite a long time (Çakır Sümer, 2015).
There are various equipment for disabled people in buses and light rail 
train sets used in traditional transportation systems in both developed and 
developing country cities. These are the disabled ramps that the disabled 
person will use while getting on the transportation vehicle, various visual 
and auditory warning systems and signs that guide the disabled people in 
transportation vehicles, seat belts and fixing apparatuses developed for 
wheelchairs that can be used as a safety precaution. There are also buses 
that use equipment that can rise and fall on bumps and pavements in tradi-
tional transportation systems. Although all the mentioned systems bring 
safety in the transportation of the disabled person and various advantages 
in getting on and off the vehicles, they cannot go beyond this. Considering 

Smart transportation for disabilities  91
disabled people while integrating smart transportation systems into tradi-
tional transportation systems, urban transportation for disabled people can 
be more manageable and transportation can be made much more advanta-
geous and easier for disabled individuals.
6.3.5 The importance of intelligent transportation 
systems for the disabled
While smart transportation systems, which are a part of smart cities, are of 
great importance for all segments of society, smart transportation applica-
tions are also important for individuals with disabilities. The most impor-
tant advantage offered by the applications is the solution to the problem of 
not being able to find a means of transportation for the disabled person. As 
the transportation systems are more manageable in smart cities, it is much 
easier for people with disabilities to access transportation vehicles, plan 
their transportation hours and use transportation vehicles. Other important 
aspects of smart transportation systems for the disabled can be listed as 
follows:
	•	 Intelligent transportation systems are very important for the disabled 
so that the disabled person is not deprived of their social life.
	•	 With smart transportation applications, the disabled person can 
find the personnel support they expect while getting on and off the 
vehicles.
	•	 Persons with disabilities can complete their journey without any ques-
tion marks, thanks to adequate audio and visual guidance systems and 
signboards in vehicles using smart transportation applications.
	•	 Persons with disabilities can easily plan their transportation over the 
internet.
6.3.6  Urban smart transportation applications 
developed for the disabled
The emergence of IoT systems in addition to the electronic circuit and sen-
sor integrations provided by the developing technology has also revealed the 
smart movement in transportation systems. Intelligent systems that show 
themselves more and more in transportation can provide the support they 
expect for the transportation of disabled people.
In a study proposed by Uzun and Hakverdi in 2019, it was proposed to 
integrate cameras that can use machine vision applications at the stops used 
for transportation in the city. According to this system, when the disabled 
person comes to the stop, the cameras detect the disabled person’s arrival 
and what kind of disability the person has and inform the unit responsible 

92  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
for transportation, and the unit takes the vehicle equipped with the equip-
ment on the journey for the disabled (Uzun and Hakverdi, 2019).
In order to solve the transportation problems of disabled people, disabled 
transportation systems have been proposed around the world and some of 
these systems have been put into practice. The vast majority of disabled 
transportation systems consist of websites where individuals can make 
transportation plans. Websites generally include information on the time 
when transportation vehicles will pass through the stops, their location on 
the line and the availability of equipment for disabled individuals. In appli-
cations developed in Germany, Italy and Sweden, the aforementioned web-
sites are used to increase the accessibility of individuals with disabilities. In 
Finland, on the other hand, there are internet-based transportation planning 
systems that provide tariff and route information to be used in transporta-
tion for the disabled and, in addition, provide transportation from home to 
home (Akbulut, 2016).
An application based on Near Field Interactive (NFC) cards, designed by 
Hakverdi in 2021 to be used in the transportation of people with disabili-
ties, is mentioned. According to the application, systems using IoT infra-
structure have been integrated into public transportation stops and units 
where public transportation is managed, and NFC cards have been defined 
for disabled individuals who will use the system. When the disabled person 
arrives at the station he/she wants to provide public transportation, he/she 
reads the NFC card to the integrated system at the stop and informs the unit 
responsible for public transportation about the disability status, the stop 
location and the public transportation line he/she wants to use, via the inter-
net. After the responsible unit accesses the transportation information 
needed by the disabled person over the internet, it directs the vehicle to the 
station where the disabled person is located. In this way, the transportation 
need of the disabled person is met completely and in a short time (Hakverdi, 
2021).
6.3.7  Conveniences provided by intelligent 
transportation applications to disabled people
As technologies using the IoTs and communication systems between 
machines increase, conveniences emerge in almost every area that affects 
human life. One of the systems using these technologies is smart transporta-
tion applications. Intelligent transportation applications bring regulations 
and improvements in many areas from traffic density to urban public trans-
portation, from environmental pollution to noise.
Intelligent transportation applications offer many conveniences to dis-
abled individuals as well as the advantages they bring to healthy individuals. 
When the city administration equips the transportation services it offers to 
its people with smart transportation applications and includes the disabled 
people in the transportation system, the conveniences listed below bring 

Smart transportation for disabilities  93
along solutions for the transportation of disabled people. The conveniences 
offered by smart transportation applications to individuals with disabilities 
are as follows:
	•	 Disabled transportation is more manageable in the city.
	•	 Persons with disabilities can plan ahead of time while using public 
transportation. In this way, the waiting time of the disabled at the bus 
stop is shorter in smart transportation systems.
	•	 In smart transportation applications where transportation personnel 
can be tracked, disabled individuals can find the support they expect 
while having fewer problems in getting on and off the transportation 
vehicles.
	•	 With smart transportation applications, disabled people can be more 
involved in social life
	•	 Access to areas such as hospitals, parks and gardens is safer and easier 
for people with disabilities.
	•	 If necessary, the disabled person can access the transportation vehicles 
specially equipped according to the disability by using smart transpor-
tation applications. He can reserve a place for himself in these vehicles 
in advance.
6.4  CONCLUSION
The gradual increase in the total number of people living in the city leads 
to some negativities in city life. As examples of these problems, we can give 
the interruption of access to various infrastructure and electricity trans-
mission services, excessive air pollution, lack of livable environments due 
to the increase in irregular construction, the rapid spread of the disease in 
the event of a possible epidemic, unemployment, increase in traffic density 
and consequently disruptions in transportation. In order to deliver the 
services offered to the people in the city without any problems, a system in 
which rational, innovative and artificial intelligence technologies are used 
in the city administration should be found. The special circumstances of 
the disadvantaged people should also be taken into account in the delivery 
of these services. Inadequacy and irregularities in urban transportation 
constitute a major problem for the people of the city. Considering these 
negativities, transportation disruptions faced by disadvantaged people 
should be minimized and thus their deprivation of social life should be 
prevented.
In this section, the subject of transportation is examined from the eyes of 
disadvantaged individuals, the problems they experience in transportation 
are evaluated, and the smart transportation applications applied to disad-
vantaged people in urban transportation are examined.

At the conclusion of this chapter, the reader will:
	
•	Understand that exploring conceptually reveals where and what kind 
of studies are done in the smart WM field.
	
•	Understand that the current problems of the WM and the AI solutions 
are discovered.
	
•	Understand the components of smart WM.
7.1  INTRODUCTION
WM basically consists of activities such as reuse and recycling. These activi-
ties aim to reduce the generation of different types of waste, such as solid 
waste, gaseous waste and liquid waste, which occur due to the rapid increase 
in population, the widespread urbanization process and industrialization. It 
also necessitates the creation of strategies to comprehensively combat the 
effects of waste (Fayomi et al., 2021). The United Nations1 recommends 
the 3R concept (“Reduce”, “Reuse”, Recycle”) to create awareness about 
the life-cycle process of WM. According to Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru 
(2019), the WM life cycle consisted of the “collection”, “segregation”, 
“transportation” and “processing” stages of the waste.

Waste management for smart cities  99
The smart city’s intelligence is depending on six “smart” dimensions: 
“governance”, “economy”, “living”, “people”, “mobility” and “environ-
ment” (Caragliu et al., 2011; Lombardi et al., 2012; Winkowska et al., 
2019; Szum, 2021). The smart city dimensions (Szum, 2021) and the appli-
cations of these dimensions (Almalki et al., 2021) are defined as follows:
	•	 A smart city is made up of highly competent, sophisticated, responsive, 
creative and responsible citizens, racially and ethnically heterogeneous 
smart people. In this context, Inclusive society, Learning, Participation 
in public life, Embracing creativity, Smart society should be practiced.
	•	 Smart living apps and cities can be achieved with smart governance. 
A smart living city is an attractive city to live in, with a high level of 
social cohesion, its residents’ sense of security, good housing, access 
to high-quality medical and educational services and culture. A smart 
governance city, on the other hand, is a city with a transparent gover-
nance system in which various factors are involved in decision-making 
processes, using services that facilitate administration and strengthen 
public participation.
	•	 Smart cities are productive, innovative and entrepreneurial cities with 
a flexible workforce, prone to national and international cooperation.
	•	 Smart cities are communicatively accessible at all scales (local, regional, 
national and international), equipped with ICT infrastructure using 
safe, sustainable and innovative modes of transportation.
	•	 The concept of a smart environment is a city where resources are 
managed efficiently, energy consumption is optimized, alternative 
energy sources are used and actions are taken to minimize the pres-
sure and pollution on the environment. Smart environmental prac-
tices are “Green buildings”, “Green consumption”, “Green energy”, 
“Green city planning” and “Green street”. In addition, smart govern-
ment applications are Demand-side policy, Transparency, ICT and 
e-government and Participatory government. Smart transportation 
applications are Parking, Highways, Traffic and Emergency services. 
Smart community applications are Surveillance, Environment, Social 
network. National applications are Utilities, Remote control, Military 
and Smart grid (Almalki et al., 2021).
WM is one of the important themes of a smart city. The aim of the chapter 
is to explore the place and current status of smart WM in smart cities. The 
rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 7.2, the current state of 
WM is presented. In Section 7.3, wastes are classified and WM problems 
in cities are handled in every aspect. In Section 7.4, a systematic literature 
review is given. In Section 7.5, the socio-technical perspective of the WM 
systems in smart cities is also presented and detailed evaluations of the WM 
topic are discussed. In Section 7.6, we present the discussion and analysis 
of the results.

7.2  CURRENT STATE OF WM
The management of wastes that increases with population growth is an 
important problem in terms of cleanliness and health. Estimating and man-
aging waste are critical to protect natural resources in terms of human, ani-
mal and environmental health. The issue of WM is from the collection of 
waste to its storage and disposal and includes an area that covers many 
processes, including logistics up to recycling. In addition to this situation, 
waste materials also show diversity.
In recent years, the concept of circular economy (CE) deals with high 
levels of resource use, balance of production and consumption, and waste. 
This concept aims to protect the economic value of the product with less 
material. It focuses on reducing waste generation, so it uses WM.
Efficient use of resources and treatment and disposal of waste create sig-
nificant environmental pressures on scrap. Therefore, environmental policy 
objectives have become important. Based on this understanding, environ-
mental objectives are:
	•	 reducing the number of input materials used
	•	 increasing resource efficiency
	•	 turning waste into a resource and reducing waste generation.
After the developments in economic growth and structural changes, accord-
ing to the data, resource use has decreased in Europe in the last ten years. 
The resource use and resource efficiency of each country vary greatly. In 
particular, global trade and the pressure it creates are reflected not only in 
Europe but also in other countries.
Especially with the pandemic process, the supply security of raw materials 
and the increasing plastic waste problem with the pandemic have become an 
increasing focus. For this reason, waste prevention and WM are the most 
important issues of the CE all over the world.
Cities face huge amounts of waste. As seen in Figure 7.1 and as is known, 
municipalities are the most important factors of WM in cities. Domestic 
wastes and chemical wastes are generated in the city. WM can also be

grouped according to their disposal or reduction conversion functions as in 
Figure 7.1. Application areas of WM can be classified into a city environ-
ment as shown in Figure 7.1.
A systematic literature review was provided to discover the current state 
of WM in smart cities and extract the features of the research area and con-
ceptually reveal where and what kind of studies should be done in the smart 
WM field. The problems and solutions to sustainable WM were also 
explored. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence within the subject was 
examined.
Esmaeilian et al. (2018) reviewed studies on the potential of smart cities 
and connected communities in terms of WM. It presented a conceptual 
framework of a centralized WM system for WM practices. It consists of (1) 
an infrastructure that collects product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibil-
ity of products throughout their entire lifecycle, (2) a new business model 
that avoids waste generation based on product lifecycle data and (3) smart 
sensor-based infrastructure for waste separation and collection. Abdallah 
et al. (2020) analyzed AI applications in various solid WM domains such as 
estimation of waste properties, bin level detection, estimation of process 
parameters, vehicle routing. For this, it systematically reviewed the literature 
compiling 85 research studies published between 2004 and 2019.
Without proper management and technology, efficient treatment of waste 
and harm to the environment, habitat and people will not prevent it. In 
addition, not only technology but also legislation and policies regarding 
WM should be developed and changed (Bani et al., 2009).
This chapter presents the current status of WM in the literature, gaps in 
the literature, problems and solutions in the literature within the framework 
of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in WM integrated into smart cities.
Today, smart WM systems (Alani et al., 2009; Coskuner et al., 2021; 
Epifantsev and Kozlova, 2021) are used to solve this critically important 
problem. In addition, researchers contribute to the literature with many 
studies using AI techniques (Abdallah et al., 2020). Figure 7.2 illustrates the 
applied fields and the frequencies of “waste management” studies of Web of 
Science (WoS) collection. More than 50% of the most cited papers are in the 
environmental environment sciences and engineering environmental 
research areas.
AI prediction and image recognition technology are used to make tradi-
tional WM smart (Liao and Wang, 2020). Different AI modeling algorithms 
are used for WM systems in the literature (Abdallah et al., 2020). Methods 
such as hybrid models (Abdallah et al., 2020; Soni et al., 2019), genetic 
algorithms (Khoa et al., 2020), neural network models and deep learning 
(Hussain et al., 2020) are applied in the field of WM.
755 studies with search terms “waste management”, “smart” with 
“AND” search strategy are found. 434 of them are directly related to smart 
cities. Figure 7.2 presents the overlay visualization of the WoS database 
research papers in the fields of smart city and WM depending on citation

weights (see Figure 7.3(a)) and their countries (see Figure 7.3(b)). Figure 
7.3(c) presents the relational network graph of the study author keywords. 
According to the figure, the “IoT” topic has a high frequency. With the 
association strength method, 29 items are extracted into 7 clusters. These 
keywords were listed for clustering the paper details of the systematic lit-
erature review.
The aim of the systematic literature review is to review the research 
regarding the WM in smart cities while identifying the problems and solu-
tions in the literature and exploring and visualizing the topic and also 
describing the directions for future research in the field. This research will 
contribute to the literature both by detecting gaps in the literature which is 
expected to guide future studies and by presenting the current situation. The 
review outlines the following. Methodology covers the systematic literature 
review used including the research questions, search criteria, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and information extraction strategy.
When the literature is examined, it is understood that researchers present 
a wide range of studies in the field of smart WM in recent years (Aarthi and 
Bhuvaneshwaran 2021; Mohamed et al., 2021; Salins et al., 2021; Akib et 
al., 2019; Toutouh et al., 2019; Wijaya et al., 2017; Doğdu et al., 2014; 
Karadimas et al., 2006). The research problems and solutions in the field of 
WM focused on smart cities and AI. It is vital to understand the impact of 
the WM problems and find the possible solutions. The following research 
questions are aimed to be addressed:
	RQ1:	
What are the problems of WM in smart cities?
	RQ2:	
Exploring conceptually reveals where and what kind of studies are 
done in the smart WM field.
	RQ3:	
Discovering the solutions to the problems.
	RQ4:	
Exploring the use of AI in the smart WM subject.
Literature searches of WoS and Google Scholar databases were undertaken 
systematically. Studies were selected according to the theme such as WM, AI 
and smart city. Only 26 of the studies in WoS database are related to “WM”, 
“artificial intelligence” and “smart cities”. Using the selected keywords with 
AND strategy, our searches identified 26 researches from WoS. After search-
ing Google Scholar, 382 results are investigated with “ waste management”, 
“smart city”, “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” keywords with 
AND strategy. A detailed hand search (manual method of searching from 
references of the found journals) was accomplished to ascertain any miss-
ing published research by referring to the cited papers in the selected papers 
via backward chaining. 75 review articles are already included in the data-
base. In conclusion, 45 potentially relevant studies are included in the search 
results. Each of the articles was independently selected according to exclu-
sion criteria by two authors. Researches were limited to those that addressed 
the smart city topic until January 2022. Additional inclusion criteria directed

the focus to articles presenting original research results. Journal papers and 
conference papers are included, and unpublished sources and gray literature 
are excluded. Language is restricted with English.
Duplicates between databases were checked and 19 papers were removed. 
After screening the titles and abstracts via focusing on the WM topic, 47 
studies were selected for detailed evaluation. Figure 7.4 presents the word 
cloud of the 47 papers. According to the frequencies, the most common 
word is “waste”.
In this research, thematic analysis (Ritchie et al., 2013; Gibbs, 2007; 
Braun and Clarke, 2006) was used in the qualitative research process 
(Creswell, 2014). Categories, themes, and related patterns about data by 
indexing data were obtained by thematic coding. We categorized the prob-
lems of the field and the solutions to the WM problems depending on the 
literature review. NVivo 122 is used.
7.3 WASTE CATEGORIZATION AND WM PROBLEMS
Every second, waste production continues around the world. One of the 
most important factors affecting climate change is how we manage waste. As 
a result of a management approach that is not sensitive to the environment, 
our environment, air, seas, in short, our world is polluted (Nižetić et al., 
2019). WM is one of the enormous issues after global warming, which affects 
the environment, the harmony of humans and nature (Gopalakrishnan and 
Figure 7.4  Word cloud of the studies.

106  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Ramaguru, 2019). For this reason, WM directly affects every aspect of life, 
including lifestyle (Aazam et al., 2016). WM is essential to build sustainable 
and livable cities. Smart WM, on the other hand, provides ecological conti-
nuity while serving all roles of the system by using innovative technologies. 
Figure 7.5 shows the word cloud of the WM problems of the codes in the 
review papers. The most frequently used words were waste collection. In 
addition, according to the systematic literature results, two major problems 
are “solid waste lifecycle processes” and “waste collection”.
Waste generation and waste collection processes are among the compo-
nents of WM. Among the articles included in its systematic review, the 
problems of these two processes are emphasized and the problems of waste 
transportation, waste treatment, waste disposal processes are rarely men-
tioned. Aazam et al. (2016) as emphasized, urban solid waste levels 
increase significantly with increasing population, urbanization, migration 
problems and lifestyle change. For this reason, WM grows into a challenge 
and necessity not only for developing countries but also for developed 
countries. The amount of garbage created by cities is increasing even faster 
than their population. This exacerbates the problem and makes garbage 
collection a very challenging task (Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019). 
Four key strategies facilitate the transition of smart cities to zero-waste 
sustainable cities: waste prevention, upstream waste separation, timely 
waste collection and appropriate recovery of collected waste (Esmaeilian 
et al., 2018). Proper classification, disposal and treatment of municipal 
waste will protect human and animal health, as well as support plant 
Figure 7.5  Word cloud of WM problems.

Waste management for smart cities  107
growth (Khan et al., 2021). The main sources of waste are households and 
industries, and wastes need to be separated at source. Currently, most of 
the waste that reaches the community or municipal bin is not properly 
separated as biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste (Gopalakrishnan 
and Ramaguru, 2019).
7.3.1  Pollution waste
Waste can have a lethal effect on human health. Harmful gasses may occur 
in waste areas or regular waste storage areas. These gasses can cause death 
associated with air pollution. One of the problems frequently mentioned in 
the literature is that solid and liquid wastes turn into gas and increase air 
pollution. In the literature, Alani et al. (2009) attach special importance to 
road construction activities. These activities will produce a large amount 
of different types of pollutants and thus destroy important habitats of the 
ecosystem, fish spawning grounds, etc. will affect (Alani et al., 2009, Doğdu 
et al., 2014). Attention should be paid to abandoned garbage, both in urban 
public areas and in places such as rural or suburban roads. Beyond the deg-
radation of the site, abandoned litter can cause pollution and have a nega-
tive impact on the quality of life (Carolis et al., 2020). Air pollution, on the 
other hand, has adverse effects especially on respiratory health.
CO2, CH4 released in abundance as a result of combustion is heat-trap-
ping gas, and global greenhouse gas emissions released by a change in tem-
perature such as climate change, N2O and F-gases are constantly growing 
on a global scale (Nižetić et al., 2019; Fayomi et al., 2021). Existing sanitary 
landfills today are not scientifically constructed as they pollute groundwater 
and also pollute the air through the emission of methane gas. Bad odor, fire 
explosions, throwing animals away are other problems encountered in land-
fills. The number of available landfills is generally not at the same level as 
the demand level of the countries (Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019).
7.3.2  Solid WM problems
After the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in biomedi-
cal waste as well as plastic and food waste. The use of plastic-based personal 
protective equipment and disinfectants has led to a large increase in plastic 
waste (Mehran et al., 2021). Millions of face masks are produced and used 
every day (Mehran et al. 2021). There has been an increase in food waste 
due to virus-laden biomedical waste as well as supply chain delays. Food 
waste has had an important concussion on sustainability and the environ-
ment is currently responsible for more than 3 Gt/y of CO2 emissions. It is 
estimated that around 28% of the world’s agricultural land is “used” for 
waste food production (Nižetić et al., 2019).
Plastic, which has a large share in waste, is a material that is difficult to 
recycle with technological processes. Environmentally unfriendly plastic is a 

108  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
problem in itself. Pure polymers are preferred over recycled plastic raw 
materials by most plastic goods manufacturers. This is due, in part, to the 
lack of reliable information on the quality, suitability and availability of 
recycled plastics due to the lack of proper separation techniques (Chidepatil 
et al., 2020, Nižetić et al., 2019).
7.3.3 Waste collecting  problems and waste 
transportation
The collection and transportation of waste are one of the most important 
management problems of cities. These very costly collection and transport 
activities can be seen as areas of optimization. Garbage collection increases 
the “autonomy” of garbage collection points, minimizing the total invest-
ment cost and purchasing cost of each bin. Autonomy relates to the num-
ber of days a Trash Point can wait between two consecutive visits by the 
collection vehicle (to empty the bins) (Rossit et al., 2019). For this reason, 
determining the garbage collection points in urban scenarios is another WM 
problem that needs to be solved. Waste collection is a daily task that requires 
planning truck routes in urban areas to avoid high fuel costs and reduce the 
number of round trips, taking into account environmental, economic and 
social factors (Khoa et al., 2020).
While technology makes people’s lives easier by minimizing the energy 
they spend, traditional methods of WM make it difficult for people to work 
and cause negative environmental effects. According to Mehran et al. (2021), 
the risk of infection can be reduced by enabling WM workers to work 
remotely. In addition, waste workers use conventional bins, which have sev-
eral disadvantages (Folianto et al., 2015) such as some bins fill before the 
scheduled time.
Transport is the main activity that is also used in WM across the country. 
The collection of waste is carried out using various vehicles such as trucks, 
tractors and much more. For example, most Indian cities lack adequate 
transport systems and use worn-out vehicles that cannot deal with waste 
efficiently. These are mainly problems encountered in WM worldwide, but 
correct and effective transportation can provide an optimized route that 
saves time and money (Khan et al., 2021).
7.3.4  Developing country problems
Climate change is affecting low-income countries very negatively. There are 
many reasons for the negative impact, such as government policies, greenhouse 
gas emissions, inadequacy of the measures taken. In global waste production 
by country, the most waste producing countries are developed countries fol-
lowed by developing and less developed countries (Fayomi et al., 2021). While 
emerging economies are in a position to process and control various types of 

Waste management for smart cities  109
waste materials, developing countries struggle with the storage and proper 
disposal of conventional general waste (Jude et al., 2021).
Sustainable planning of WM depends on reliable data on the seasonal 
variation of waste. Conventional waste characterization techniques are 
cumbersome and expensive in most developing countries (Adeleke et al., 
2021b). Developing countries are more seriously affected by waste com-
pared to developed countries. In low-income countries, waste is held in 
unregulated landfills and may be incinerated in open areas. As a result, the 
environment is adversely affected. This effect also includes health. Methane 
is produced and this causes global climate change. Mohammad et al. (2021) 
noted that solid waste disposal is very costly in low-income countries.
7.3.5  Environmental awareness and adaptation of IT 
for WM
One of the main reasons behind unsuccessful WM is lack of awareness. 
Recent studies mostly focus on environmental awareness in WM. Individuals 
who produce waste lack awareness of why and how waste should be sepa-
rated, waste collectors and processors lack awareness of how to treat use-
ful wastes and how to dispose of non-useful wastes. WM rules of 2016 in 
India say that source segregation of waste is mandated to channel waste 
into wealth through recovery, reuse and recycling (Gopalakrishnan and 
Ramaguru, 2019). Most people in India do not know about dry waste and 
wet waste and cannot distinguish between them. It is very important to 
organize workshops and seminars on efficient WM in every city and com-
munity to draw attention to sanitation and waste separation (Khan et al., 
2021). To steer society toward green, awareness of green behavior and a cul-
ture of smart green citizenship should be promoted (Mehran et al., 2021).
Adapting IT to WM is another important issue. Human intervention is 
often required to analyze collected data, extract meaningful insights and 
build smart applications (Khoa et al., 2020). Complementary factors such as 
information systems need to be managed in smart WM systems. These social 
factors of the system will help the citizens/users of the system to adapt the 
solution.
According to Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru (2019), due to the lack of 
technology in monitoring waste flow, waste producers and waste handlers 
do not know how and where to handle waste after it comes out of the bin. 
There is no suitable tracking system for WM. Although technologies such as 
RFID are used for WM, their use is limited. Manual entry of data in the cur-
rent WM system will lead to data errors creating inconsistencies and inac-
curate data entries and manipulation of data for financial gains 
(Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019, Hussain et al. 2020). A standard 
database of garbage statistics and a real-world dataset are also not available 
(Hussain et al., 2020).

110  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Existing studies focus on the digitalization intentions of companies, 
neglecting the actual level of digital technologies and do not differentiate the 
level of digitalization in terms of WM (Borchard et al., 2021). Current WM 
trends are not complex enough to achieve a robust and efficient WM mecha-
nism (Aazam et al., 2016, Khoa et al., 2020, Lu et al., 2013). The analysis of 
the information collected by the sensors supports the creation of certain 
services and systems that not only improve people’s quality of life but also 
optimize city resources.

112  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
7.4.1  Strategic perspective of WM
Effective WM strategies and strong and effective actions on the basis of 
individuals, countries, institutions and systems are needed to fully achieve 
and implement environmental goals.
7.4.1.1  Sectoral regulations
Since the implementation of an effective WM system is a necessity, it is vitally 
important for people in that country to participate in various practices in 
appropriate waste collection and disposal. Khan et al. (2021) emphasize 
that it is very important to give them the right instruction as the garbage col-
lector from different parts of the cities or towns does not receive any reward 
from the society. Any country or city can be free of pollution when every 
sector participates equally and pays attention to WM (Khan et al., 2021).
Borchard et al. (2021) captured firms’ strategic digitalization plans to 
analyze their levels of digitization along with different steps of the WM 
value chain. In the energy sector, different strategies and techniques are 
used for energy efficiency, low CO2, reduced traffic and reduced resource 
use in smart cities (Almalki et al., 2021). Plastic companies should apply 
similar regulations. Mehran et al. (2021) emphasized that companies 
should use renewable, recyclable, reusable and packaging materials con-
taining recycled content. Also, the effort can be simplified by clearly print-
ing the recycling instruction on the packaging. During COVID-19, millions 
of new plastic bottles are produced to meet consumer needs. Companies 
should develop guidelines for optimum packaging size and to use environ-
mentally friendly materials for packaging. The government-led National 
Domestic Waste Program is largely part of the policy and management for 
this sector to take it to new heights and create a more efficient system 
(Aggarwal et al., 2021).
7.4.1.2  Collaboration
The theme of cooperation in WM takes the first place in the literature. 
Industry and academy cooperation, plastic industry academy cooperation, 
public-private cooperation, participation of non-governmental organiza-
tions are some of them. Participation and cooperation mean being involved 
and supporting the process. According to Wang and Li (2021), municipal 
solid WM is a participatory process in which stakeholders should take 
initiative and be involved. The science and technology sectors should be 
actively encouraged to participate in the development and promotion of 
WM technology. University-industry collaborations help improve coordina-
tion among stakeholders by finding efficient solutions (Mehran et al., 2021). 
A public-private partnership is needed to implement such a system, which 
we find significantly less in the current scenario (Khan et al., 2021).

Waste management for smart cities  113
Countries should focus on the green deal vision for waste prevention, 
green technology processes. Wang and Li (2021) emphasized the importance 
of strengthening smart waste industry infrastructure. The government 
should improve the solid waste disposal industry’s development mechanism, 
continuously expand the waste treatment market and optimize resource 
management. Other stakeholders should also be involved in the WM pro-
cess (Nam and Pardo, 2011). Research and Development of the Municipal 
Solid Waste Management Platform for Residents’ Engagement in Governance 
Activities is another solution (Wang and Li, 2021). Businesses should actively 
cooperate with the media and organize innovative and creative competi-
tions. The dissemination of science and other activities aimed at schools at 
all levels and different urban solid waste treatment groups should be encour-
aged. For companies that are actively involved in urban waste treatment, 
low-interest bank loans can be established, and for companies whose tax 
breaks are otherwise, a final penalty mechanism can be established (Wang 
and Li, 2021). Customers and citizens should be educated, informed and 
guided on environmentally friendly behavior through print, digital and 
social media (Mehran et al. 2021).
7.4.2 AI solutions
AI is widely used in the field of WM as in many other fields (Ahmed and 
Asadullah, 2020). AI offers solutions to the waste problem with smart tech-
nologies and is mostly used in information models. Traditional waste esti-
mation methods typically involve relationship research. AI-based models 
can accurately predict waste generation with AI algorithms and learning 
tools (Jude et al., 2021).
It focuses on the use of AI in critical urban infrastructure sectors. There 
are studies on the use of AI in monitoring and auditing activities in sewage 
treatment systems and WM systems, waste reuse, monitoring technological 
processes in drinking water preparation and distribution systems (Gaska 
and Generowicz, 2020).
7.4.2.1  Plastic WM
AI solutions have also increased the management of plastic waste, which 
has become a major crisis as a result of quarantine and isolation during 
the pandemic, which has also accelerated the transition to digitaliza-
tion. It is recommended to use AI in WM systems, such as AI-equipped 
robots that can sort automatically at every stage from civil society to 
industrial waste (Mehran et al., 2021). Reliable item detection and clas-
sification through image recognition and machine learning will for bet-
ter ­ecological sustainability after the pandemic (Mehran et al., 2021; 
Fayomi et al., 2021).

114  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
7.4.2.2  Air pollution
Air pollution is the biggest problem that threatens humanity and is getting 
harder to control day by day (Almalki et al., 2021). AI is widely applied to 
solve problems related to air pollution, water and wastewater treatment 
modeling, soil remediation simulation and groundwater pollution, as well 
as planning solid WM strategies (Abdallah et al., 2020, Yetilmezsoy et al., 
2011). The use of IoT and machine learning-based WM systems, smart sen-
sors that monitor pollution, AI models that predict the levels of gasses in the 
atmosphere are used as effective solutions (Khoa et al., 2020, Almalki et al., 
2021, Abdallah et al., 2020).
7.4.2.3 Waste generation, collection and transportation
The amount of waste is proportional to the per capita income of the coun-
try. Along with population growth in low-middle-income countries, there 
has been an increase in waste generation (Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 
2019). Therefore, it is essential to optimize the collection process as well as 
reduce waste generation. Countries with already low economic levels incur 
more collection costs due to failure in WM. With AI, it can predict waste 
generation patterns, optimize waste ­collection truck routes, locate WM 
facilities and simulate waste recycling ­processes. They created improved 
routes taking into account the contents of ­garbage containers, which are 
constantly monitored via IoT-based smart meters (Abdallah et al., 2020, 
Vitorino De Souza Melaré et al., 2017).
It complicates the problem and makes it more difficult to track and collect 
waste, as it dumps waste anywhere with no regard for the environment and 
public health (Aggarwal et al., 2021, Jude et al., 2021). They designed an 
intelligent garbage collection management system that makes up SmartGC, 
whose architecture is detailed and explained. Waste collection is a logistics 
activity. IoT-based waste collection data is processed by machine learning 
applications in AI systems (Alqahtani et al., 2020, Ramalho et al., 2020). AI 
can be done using robotic arms for classification from WM operations 
(Mehran et al., 2021).
7.4.2.4  Swachh adaptive intelligence-blockchain
SwachhCoin3 aims for a broader reach than quotidian cryptocurrency 
programs. SwachhCoin is a sustainable business project developed to 
solve the environmental management problem. SWatel (Swachh Adaptive 
Intelligence), SWata (Swachh Big Data), SWoT (Swachh Internet of 
Things), SWbin (Swachh Bin) and SWapp (Swachh App) are some of them 
(Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019).

Waste management for smart cities  115
7.4.2.5  Deep learning
Big data analytics can provide energy efficiency predictions for improving 
the quality of life by analyzing all data of cities and people. Deep learning 
techniques can be applied to identify and reduce greener system design and 
distribution ranges while providing accurate prediction for energy efficiency 
(Almalki et al., 2021). Images captured with solar-powered security cameras 
can be imported into a deep training model to predict the true state of the 
bin (Aggarwal et al., 2021).
7.4.3  Smart WM information systems for smart 
cities
For a smart WM system, the correct determination of the amount and 
quality of garbage is critical in terms of determining the vehicle to be 
used, the collection frequency and route and the number of employees 
and other parameters (Jude et al., 2021, Adeleke et al., 2021a). Aggarwal 
et al. (2021) used transfer learning and pattern recognition to implement 
an intelligent WM system. Having an intelligent WM system, not only will 
the waste situation be notified when to collect it, but also all stakeholders 
will be informed in a timely manner of the type and amount of waste. It 
also helps create more effective recycling ways and minimize waste, as well 
as make overall WM more efficient and environmentally friendly. With 
methods such as cloud technology, a cloud-based system for smart cities 
where waste bins are equipped with sensors can report waste levels and 
upload information to the cloud. The smart WM mechanism has died. 
Stakeholders can access the desired data from the cloud (Aazam et al., 
2016).
7.4.3.1 Waste collecting and tracking
New technologies (GISs, RFIDs, Ultrasonic Sensors) are used to ensure qual-
ity, continuity and sustainability while monitoring waste generation (Jude 
et al., 2021, Soni et al., 2019). Real-time drone applications (Almalki et 
al., 2021), IoT-based real-time monitoring of a garbage collection system 
(Hussain et al., 2020), remote sensing (Fayomi et al., 2021) are some exam-
ples in the literature. Shyam et al. (2017) show that using a sensor-aided 
IoT prototype, they can read, collect and transmit vast amounts of data 
from trash cans over the internet, so that trash cans can become intelli-
gent. Different scenarios and simulations are performed for various situa-
tions to investigate the benefits of such systems over a conventional system 
(Ramalho et al. 2020, De Carolis et al. 2020).

116  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
7.4.3.2  Solid waste
Due to its excellent modeling abilities, complex mechanisms have been 
successfully applied to environmental-related fields such as ML methods, 
wastewater, air pollutants and solid waste treatments (Xia et al., 2021). 
Wang and Li (2021) presented suggestions for the treatment of municipal 
solid waste in the background of smart city construction. The most strik-
ing feature of municipal solid WM in Russia is the classification of wastes 
according to their toxic effects on the environment (Wang and Li, 2021). 
Alani et al. (2009) developed a prototype to give advice on how to minimize 
the impact of solid WM at the construction site.
Misra et al. (2018) presented an integrated detection system that auto-
mated the solid WM process. The proposed smart trash can is based on the 
ultrasonic level sensor and various gas sensors that automatically detect 
dangerous gasses and the maximum waste limit. They used cloud and mobile 
application-based monitoring. On the other hand, Coskuner et al. (2021) 
indicated that reliable estimation of municipal solid waste production rates 
was an important element in the planning and implementation of sustain-
able solid WM strategies. They used a multilayer perceptron artificial neural 
network to validate the estimation of annual production rates of domestic, 
commercial and construction and demolition wastes. Roy et al. (2021) pre-
sented an integrated planning of IoT-based smart bin allocation and vehicle 
routing in solid WM.
7.4.3.3  IoT-based WM system
IoT devices are used to monitor and support human activities in WM. With 
the TrashNet waste material database, wastes are classified and recorded 
(Alqahtani et al., 2020, Alani et al., 2009). IoT-based smart bins, which 
also use a machine and deep learning model, can be applied to manage 
the disposal of garbage and predict the air pollutant emitted from the bins 
(Hussain et al., 2020). According to Ramalho et al. (2020), thanks to IoT-
based smart meters, they can create dynamic routes depending on the con-
tent of the garbage containers that are constantly monitored.
7.4.3.4  Smart agriculture solutions
Smart agriculture is another important phenomenon of smart cities. IoT 
technologies that will provide resource efficiency, sustainability and econ-
omy can be applied in agriculture. IoT technologies, which are used in agri-
culture especially for smart irrigation and can contribute to environmental 
sustainability, are mentioned. In addition, management information systems 
have been created to help farmers make decisions with 94% report accuracy, 
using IoT and cloud-based smart agriculture monitoring systems for soil 
temperature and humidity detection (Nižetić et al., 2019). A case study of a 

Waste management for smart cities  117
solar pumping system tracked with the application of IoT technologies for 
smart agriculture in Thailand (Sirisamphanwong et al., 2019) is reported.
7.4.3.5  Smart grid
Smart grids contribute to the environment and the efficient use of resources 
by reducing air pollution, burning fossil fuels less and reducing greenhouse 
gasses by using wind and solar energy. The distribution and transmission 
efficiency of smart data, in other words, the efficiency of smart grids, is 
an important issue (Nižetić et al., 2019). Smart grid optimization is an 
approach that makes it possible to improve both economic and environ-
mental aspects. Further research efforts toward the development of general 
load forecasting methods and energy distribution and consumption patterns 
should also be directed.
7.4.3.6  Software solutions
There are also software solutions using smart techniques for WM in the 
literature. Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru (2019) created SwBIN (Swachh 
Bins), which ensures proper and maximum waste collection. When waste is 
stored, SwBIN will calculate reward points by measuring parameters such 
as the amount and quality of deposited waste that will identify the user 
with a QR. The reward will be paid out to users in Swachh Tokens. Hussain 
et al. (2020) have developed an Android app connected to Firebase data-
base to instantly see live updates of smart boxes. Android apps are specially 
designed for cleaning workers who are responsible for collecting waste. By 
logging into the running application, he can check the status of the boxes 
and receive notifications about the box. The employee can choose the opti-
mized route between the app and the different bins. When hazardous gasses 
are detected in a smart trash can, a warning message is sent to the worker so 
they can take action to dispose of toxic waste and protect the worker. The 
worker can see the garbage statistics. The web application has also been 
developed to obtain real-time information on litter status and air quality 
in a given area. During the operation, a manager assigns the areas to the 
private paramedic who is responsible for collecting the garbage in a timely 
manner. Monthly reports are generated by a system that displays statistics 
on air pollution in a given area, timely collection of garbage and other useful 
factors necessary to improve people’s lifestyle (Hussain et al., 2020).
7.4.4  Intelligent technology-based solutions
7.4.4.1  Blockchain technology
In order to overcome the difficulties experienced by WM, new technolo-
gies AI and blockchain technology are also used. Blockchain provides a 

118  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
cryptographically secure system with its distributed structure and record 
system. Incentives and settlements are obtained in real time via local cryp-
tocurrency (Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019). Blockchain-based 
Swachhcoin was created to manage waste from households and industries 
and transform them into useful products in an efficient and environmentally 
friendly way. With the use of blockchain, electricity, paper, steel, timber, pre-
cious metals, glass plastics are some of the high economic value outputs 
from processed waste (Gopalakrishnan and Ramaguru, 2019). Chidepatil 
et al. (2020) sort plastics by type using blockchain smart contracts powered 
by multi-sensor data fusion algorithms and using AI. At the same time, it 
has made it possible to increase the reliability of information about recycled 
plastics by being transparent.
7.4.4.2  Cloud and fog computing
Cloud computing technology is also used in WM solutions. IoT’s need for 
Big data requires large storage capacity to make IoT ubiquitous and large 
bandwidth for transmission. IoT devices consume large amounts of energy 
with Big data processing and transmission (Almalki et al., 2021). Hussain 
et al. (2020) made operations by connecting to Google Cloud Server, an 
IoT-based server, to predict the status of the smart trash can and predict 
air quality based on real-time data. Sensor data is stored in the Firebase 
cloud server (Hussain et al., 2020). Aazam et al. (2016) proposed a similar 
cloud-based smart WM mechanism where waste bins are equipped with 
sensors, which can report waste level statuses and upload the status to the 
cloud.
Fog computing, on the other hand, has potential for different applications 
and services, such as in the analysis of surveillance videos, as it makes it pos-
sible to reduce costs and increase overall efficiency, which can be imple-
mented in Smart cities (Nižetić et al., 2019, Almalki et al., 2021).
7.4.4.3  Drone technology
Drone technology is one of the key technologies for both improving the 
quality of life, monitoring waste and monitoring air pollution in smart cities 
(Almalki et al., 2021).
7.4.4.4  IoT-based technologies including global positioning 
system (GPS), RFID, and sensors
Issues such as energy consumption and savings, carbon emission, carbon 
labeling and footprint, which are directly related to WM, have also attracted 
the attention of researchers within the scope of IoT (Almalki et al., 2021). 
IoT technologies are used to reduce traffic congestion, which is one of the 
main problems of smart cities, to improve public digital transformation, 

Waste management for smart cities  119
to create low-cost municipal services, to keep citizens safe and healthy, to 
reduce energy consumption, to improve and reduce monitoring systems 
(Almalki et al., 2021).
Smart city applications should first of all be environmentally friendly. 
Therefore, there must be progress toward green IoT. Green IoT provides a 
more sustainable environment for smart cities (Almalki et al., 2021).
RFID technology has also been used in the field of WM in recent years. In 
the literature, a food waste collection method has been applied using RFID 
technology (Khoa et al., 2020). Hussain et al. (2020) defined barcode and 
RFID technology as types of identification technology for solid WM. Sensors 
(Hussain et al., 2020) and smart sensor-based infrastructures (Esmaeilian et 
al., 2018) have started to be used in various IoT-based technological solu-
tions to manage waste.
7.4.4.5  GPS
GPSs have been used in WM (Folianto et al., 2015; Fayomi et al., 2021) in 
literature.
7.4.4.6  PADL description language
PADL description language has been specifically tailored to assist in the defi-
nition and operationalization phases of the ML life cycle (Díaz-de-Arcaya 
et al., 2020).
7.4.4.7  ICT
Information and communication technology (ICT) systems are used in 
smart WM. For the smart city, ICT is used, which also reduces energy 
consumption and CO2 emissions, thus enabling the transition to be a 
sustainable smart city (Almalki et al., 2021). With this feature, ICT also 
contributes to the sustainability of green IoT in smart cities. Smart cit-
ies cannot be achieved without ICT. Green IoT applications in smart cit-
ies, smart transportation, smart building, smart parking etc. are the most 
important factor in reducing garbage collection and CO2 emissions and 
energy consumption (Almalki et al., 2021, Ramalho et al., 2020, Díaz-de-
Arcaya et al., 2020).
The use of LoRa (Long Range) communication techniques is a technique 
that can be used in intelligent WM, especially for purposes such as enabling 
authorized persons to get rid of filled trash cans without an internet connec-
tion. Khoa et al. (2020) present a new platform, a sensor module to measure 
the geolocation of collected data based on LoRa technology and the garbage 
fill height using ultrasound and a microcontroller system for smart garbage 
control at the university.

120  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
7.4.5  Data solutions
7.4.5.1  Data collection
Thanks to IoT-based data collection systems, data on daily activities, social 
participation and other elements that threaten national security were col-
lected (Nižetić et al., 2019). All the technologies mentioned so far provide 
a great ease of access in data collection and recording. Analysis of this data 
will provide improvements in smart cities’ management and determine 
cost and resource use (Díaz-de-Arcaya et al., 2020). At this point, the most 
important problem is related to data transfer speed and security (Nižetić 
et al., 2019).
7.4.5.2  Big data solutions
Big data helps analysis by providing data to applications that use AI on 
issues such as the type, amount, location, route and recycled materials of 
waste. Analysis of this data can also be used to predict the behavior of 
defined objects in smart cities, such as trash cans. Nižetić et al. (2019) also 
state that data related to connected devices, after processing with techniques 
such as Big data, may reveal hidden patterns in user habits that are not nor-
mally captured by surfing the internet (Nižetić et al., 2019).
In the smart city context, Big data analytics plays an important role in 
processing the data collected via IoT devices (Díaz-de-Arcaya et al., 2020). 
The data can also be applied with deep learning techniques to obtain accu-
rate predictions in energy efficiency and for green system design and ways to 
further reduce deployment intervals (Almalki et al., 2021). As a result of Big 
data analysis, the potential garbage heap is reduced. With real-time analysis, 
wastes can be separated accurately, wastes generated can be reduced to zero, 
and health-threatening factors such as harmful gasses can be managed.
7.4.5.3  Data analytics and data-driven decision-making
Smart cities need to develop a smart way to monitor, identify and measure 
waste automatically and accurately (Carolis et al., 2020, Shah et al., 2021) 
Smart waste analytics is another area that needs to be applied. Using ultra-
sonic sensors, specific use-case predictions are made with fingerprints of 
garbage bins (Shah et al., 2021).
Traditionally, mathematical formulation based on integer programming 
has been used to determine the location of garbage collection points, while 
minimizing the required number of visits to the collection vehicle in relation 
to the system costs, i.e. the installment cost and routing cost of the garbage 
cans (Rossit et al., 2019). Remote status of dust bins via web server (Shah 
et al., 2021) prevents the creation of an unhygienic environment (Shah et al., 
2021). The data mining process can also be applied in many areas such as 
the development and implementation of smart environmental decisions, 

Waste management for smart cities  121
optimization, forecasting, behavior analysis. Adeleke et al. (2021a) define a 
data mining framework that highlights WM processes based on intelligent 
modeling techniques to assist the domestic “waste database” that will sup-
port WM decisions. In this way, this process is optimized for WM facilities 
and investments. According to these authors, there is a need for multi sec-
toral intervention and participation to develop sustainability of WM in 
South Africa (Adeleke et al., 2021b).
7.4.5.4  Data security and citizen privacy
There are various applications of smart and IoT technologies in relation to 
the security issues in many fields such as “e-health”, “smart homes”. Smart 
management systems have become obviously attractive for diverse surveil-
lance and to provide security (Nižetić et al., 2019). Data security and citizen 
privacy (Esmaeilian et al., 2018) are another issue in this area. All informa-
tion collected is about municipal employees, citizens and other stakeholders 
in garbage counting. In addition, video data can come from sensors, includ-
ing roles and custom vehicle images.Privacy should be ensured in terms of 
real-time environmental data.
7.4.6  Social complementary solutions
Information systems include technology, software, hardware, process, as well 
as social factors that are directly related to the user. For information systems 
to be successful, these social factors must be taken into account, including 
economic, political, cultural and behavioral influences. Social complemen-
tary solutions include the cultural, behavioral and emotional dimensions of 
IT users. Figure 7.6 presents the cluster analysis of the social complementary 
solutions node with Pearson coefficient. Nodes are compared. According to 
the figure, similar codes are presented in a hierarchical way. These clusters 
are not valid enough so that these clusters could be used to further analyze 
data and build a model and hypotheses.
7.4.6.1  Culture adaptation
It is known from the research results that the success of information systems 
comes with complementary factors of information systems such as cultural 
resistance, support and harmony (Laudon and Laudon, 2015). In the litera-
ture (Esmaeilian et al., 2018), it is mentioned that the technology in WM is 
compatible with the local culture.
7.4.6.2  Behavioral issues
There is a relationship between waste production and recycling behav-
ior. Minelgaitė and Liobikienė (2019) discussed the WM behavior issues 

122  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
addressed for the EU region. The study explained the relationship between 
waste reduction and resource efficiency based on a general lack of knowl-
edge among the EU population (Nižetić et al., 2019). Waste generation also 
depends on family size, education and monthly income. Perceptions of resi-
dential waste disposal are influenced by the active sponsorship and spending 
of a real estate agent, community involvement by neighborhood entertain-
ment committee members, and distribution fees based on waste or waste 
weight. Behavior, gender, peer influence, land size, location and involvement 
of environmental agency are also addressed in the study (Jude et al., 2021).
Data to define smart solutions and the effects of smart solutions on con-
sumer behavior are two other cornerstones of smart cities (Esmaeilian et al., 
2018). In this context, it is important to explore the capabilities of disrup-
tive technologies to achieve sustainable cities. Here, the disruptive technolo-
gies may alter consumer behavior toward “pro-environmental behavior”, to 
perform significant changes in individual behaviors (Esmaeilian et al., 2018).
7.4.6.3  Enhance the ability of IT users
Education is mandatory to enable individuals to contribute to the solution 
of the waste problem (Nižetić et al., 2019). There is a need for developing 
residents’ ability to use information technology and teaching the concept of 
waste treatment, nonprofits and media stakeholders. Meanwhile, it is cer-
tain that educators have a duty to rely on the latest information and suitable 
educational tools to build up the knowledge and skills of all stakeholders 
regarding the disposal of municipal solid waste (Wang and Li, 2021).
It is necessary to organize workshops and seminars on efficient WM to 
draw attention to sanitation and waste separation in every city and com-
munity (Khan et al., 2021). Khan et al. (2021) suggested raising widespread 
awareness among people by organizing workshops.
Figure 7.6  Dendrogram of social complementary solutions node.

Waste management for smart cities  123
Reward-based systems (Esmaeilian et al., 2018) are one of the comple-
mentary success factors of WM practices in smart cities. This brings us to 
the concept of gamification (DeBurr, 2013), which is the process of increas-
ing participation by making the activity fun of game design logic in non-
game applications.
7.4.6.4 Well-being management
Urban planning is the basic and simplest starting point of smart cities. 
Protecting the well-being and health of every citizen is the most important 
factor, regardless of whether it is a smart city, sustainable city. In sustainable 
smart cities, obesity levels are low and citizens’ mental health is positive. It is 
a fact that the quality and style of sustainable cities are explicitly connected 
to the well-being and health of citizens (Almalki et al., 2021). Solid WM 
and recycling in low-income countries are operated mostly by the support 
of these waste collectors. On the other hand, the attempt to refine their well-
being during the pandemic will contribute to their long-range environmen-
tal sustainability goals via implementation of the resource recycling process 
(Mehran et al., 2021).
7.4.7  Circular economy
The CE is defined as “a production and consumption model” that includes 
“sharing”, “renting”, “reusing”, “repairing” and/or “recycling” available 
materials and products for providing that is possible. It is the starting point 
of the Maker movement. WM, evaluation of effective use of resources in 
terms of opportunities and risks can be gathered under this theme.
7.4.7.1  Countries focus on green deal
The aim of the European Green Deal is to reverse the loss of biodiversity 
and increase the efficient use of resources in the transition to a clean, CE, 
thereby halting climate change. Lekkas et al. (2021) pointed out that EU 
countries should consider mainly “waste prevention” and “resource effi-
ciency” within the range of the“EU’s Green Deal”. These authors think that 
this can only be attained by applying “effective transition to the CE” and 
“circular bioeconomy”. In this way, renewable biological resources will be 
generated. This will transform these resources into value-added products 
such as “food”, “feed”, “bio-based products” and “bioenergy” (Lekkas 
et al., 2021).
7.4.7.2  Greening technology processes
Greening technology processes are a very important issue. Almalki et al. 
(2021) analyzed the “greening technologies for sustainable smart cities” by 

124  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
investigating the “greening IoT” in order to improve the “environment”, 
“quality of life” and “economy”. On the other hand, these authors focused 
on minimizing the negative impact on the environment and human health. 
There is a movement to merge “low-cost IoT architectures” with “optimal 
WM strategies” (Khoa et al., 2020). Considering the allocation of huge funds 
for R&D on COVID-19 vaccine and other antiviral drug invention processes, 
there is a demand for a “global initiative” to establish sustainable solutions 
to maintain key resources with maximal “waste recycling” and “smart WM” 
systems (Mehran et al., 2021). In addition, new business models should be 
created for sharing product and service information (Esmaeilian et al., 2018) 
and using pollution control technologies to prevent waste generation. To min-
imize the environmental impact associated with solid waste, it is important to 
develop strategic WM, pollution control technologies and stricter legislation 
on waste treatment and disposal (Bani et al., 2009).
There is a need for accessing “cleaner transportation systems”. These sys-
tems can be based on electric vehicles and in fact novel intelligent transpor-
tation systems. For instance, although it is starting to slowly change, electric 
cars are sold globally (Nižetić et al., 2019).
7.4.7.3  Material conversion
Recycling is an important stage of smart WM. In recent years, different recy-
cling possibilities have been investigated all over the world. Research focused 
on recycling, it also shows that the main purpose is to transform waste into 
useful resources (materials). Significant efforts are made to solve the problems 
associated with different types of waste (plastic waste, electronic waste, poly-
mer waste, etc.). There are many new product or material trials (new building 
materials, precious metals regeneration, hydrogen production, etc.) for differ-
ent potential engineering applications (Nižetić et al., 2019).
7.4.7.4  Recycled plastic usage
One of the best examples where recycled plastics contribute to sustainability 
by using them in different areas is the park benches and flower pots made 
using recycled plastic. It remains an effective practice to reduce to some 
extent the consumption of large plastics, which peaked during COVID-19 
(Mehran et al., 2021). They emphasized that stakeholders should announce 
incentives for the use of recyclable materials and that priority should be 
given to recycling PET caps and PP bottles (Mehran et al., 2021).
7.4.7.5  Renewable energy technologies
Energy is one of the issues that cannot be stored but needs to be managed 
most efficiently. Ensuring the use and distribution of renewable energy tech-
nologies with data distribution and transmission technologies such as block-
chain is the most important step (Nižetić et al., 2019).

Waste management for smart cities  125
It is a fact that renewable energy technologies are generated as a reaction 
toward fossil energy options. It should be noted that due to the slow energy 
conversion process, there are some limitations for achieving efficiency and 
non-distribution of energy generation. Considering the current situation, the 
global markets are strongly dominated by “photovoltaics” and “wind gen-
erators”. On the other hand, the investments for “large hydroelectric power 
plants” are at modest rates, while their potential has been exploited for 
decades, mostly in advanced countries (Nižetić et al., 2019).
Solar energy use currently focuses on electricity generation from photo-
voltaic technologies or heat generation from various solar energy systems 
(Nižetić et al., 2019).
7.5  SOCIO-TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE IN WM
“Environmental informatics” can be defined as a novel interdisciplinary 
domain between “environmental science” and “computer science”. This 
novel domain has been in use for more than a decade in order to pro-
mote strategic informatics tools and assist decision-makers by connecting 
“domain knowledge” with intended “social”, “economic”, “ecological” 
and “environmental “ objectives (Lu et al., 2013). “Environmental infor-
matics” has been widely used with rapid progress over the past decade. It 
contributes to the processes such as “ planning”, “design” and “operations 
for WM”. However, according to Lu et al. (2013), the strategic role of these 
information technologies is mostly restricted to individual projects without 
synergistic effects. It should be noted that typical WM processes include var-
ious parameters such as “technical”, “climatic”, “environmental”, “demo-
graphic”, “socio-economic” and “legal” (Abdallah et al., 2020).
It can be stated that the dimensions of the smart city do not only focus on 
technological aspects (Szum, 2021). An effective WM system, in addition to 
the use of innovative technologies, should have approaches suitable for the 
lifestyle of citizens, while reducing the rate of waste generation, without 
increasing the life privatization of smart city citizens and reducing flexibility 
in social life. There are “embedded sensors” which are used for collecting 
data, and this enables making “real-time analytics” to create awareness for 
citizens toward sustainable behavior. These sensors also serve as agents that 
guide environmental behavior. This guidance is based on requirements for 
further analysis to understand the role of different parameters, such as 
“socio-demographic characteristics of the citizens” and “conditions of the 
region” (Esmaeilian et al., 2018).
According to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme,4 more 
than 55% of the world’s population lives in cities and this rate is expected 
to increase to 68% by 2050. As our number increases in the world, our need 
to manage waste in the environment will also increase. We need IT solu-
tions. These solutions generate data. Citizens continue their lives around 

126  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
data from everything, the flow with smart devices. Users should be able to 
use these devices easily with as little effort as possible. At this point, human-
computer interaction and therefore psychology sciences come into play. 
WM is a social phenomenon and involves crowded systems. In this respect, 
socio-technical systems will be the right solution for WM. The development 
of smart cities will greatly improve the living and working environments of 
city residents, enabling them to generate more benefits with less effort and 
energy. Smart cities should also increase the well-being of city residents. The 
applications developed by considering the social factors and considering the 
ease of use of people are socio-technical.
The components of an information system are the same as the smart city 
categories since it is an information system. Chourabi et al. (2012) analyzed 
the critical factors of smart city initiatives under eight categories of “man-
agement”, “governance”, “policy”, “technology”, “people”, “infrastruc-
ture”, “economy” and “natural environment” (Esmaeilian et al., 2018). 
There are various possibilities put forward to support the development of 
smart cities in the world. Prominent among these are “efficient infrastruc-
ture”, “social and human capital”, “cultural inclusion”, “regulatory incen-
tives” and “appropriate management”. The successful factors of WM 
practices in smart cities depend on too many factors which are listed under 
five main categories of “data”, “technology”, “economy”, the “social aspect” 
and “governance” (Esmaeilian et al., 2018):
	•	 Data: This category involves key concepts related to data such as “auto-
matic product lifecycle data collection”, “real-time data analysis”, 
“data-driven decision making”, “data sharing”, “open data”, “data 
security” and “citizen privacy”.
	•	 Technology: This category focuses on technological issues such as 
“intelligent & connected devices”, “new data acquisition and com-
munication technologies”, “resilient infrastructure”, “standardization 
of technology”.
	•	 Economy: This category defines economy as “novel business models”, 
“sharing economy”, “circular economy models”.
	•	 Social aspect: This category is related to “citizens’ participation”, 
“green behavior”, “smart collaboration among stakeholders”, “tech-
nologies compatible with local culture”, “reward-based systems”.
	•	 Governance: This category is defined as “strategic planning”, “non-
governmental parties’ involvement”, “laws and regulations compat-
ible with CE concept”.
It is obvious that the management of complementary and social factors in 
information systems is important for the efficiency and success of the sys-
tems. Also, in recent years, WM had a socio-technical perspective in the 
smart city perspective.

Waste management for smart cities  127
Gartner’s Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021, the strategic future 
technology trends for the current year fall under three themes: People cen-
tricity, location independence and resilient delivery. The Internet of Behaviors 
trend which is about using data to change behaviors is the strategic techno-
logical trend foreseen for 2021. It is a fact that consumer behavior plays a 
strategic role in both formation and convenient disposal of waste. However, 
it should be noted that consumer behavior is known as a difficult-to-predict 
factor (Esmaeilian et al., 2018). Using information systems, a user or a role 
can be persuaded to a behavior or attitude.
These roles could be IoT devices. For instance, with technologies such as 
IoT, garbage must be managed, and the behavior of garbage cans must be 
managed. For this, first of all, the behavior of the garbage cans should be 
examined. There are many software systems designed using Persuasive 
Technology5 (Fogg, 2003) in the literature (Alrobai et al., 2016; Alrobai et 
al., 2018). To bring awareness and practices to the environmental issue, 
socio-technical systems must be designed to persuade at the personal and 
crowd level.
In addition, it is mentioned in the literature (Esmaeilian et al., 2018) that 
rewarding also helps to convince the roles in support of environmental man-
agement. Software system applications of gamification are also available in 
the literature (Snijders et al., 2015). Blockchain infrastructure is also a solu-
tion to smart WM.
7.6  CONCLUSIONS
In recent years, we have started to feel climate change in our daily lives.
We conducted a systematic literature review on the field of waste manage-
ment in smart cities. After accomplishing the database searches, and hand 
searches, 49 studies were chosen for the analysis. Afterward, further analysis 
was made based on design, methods, and coherence of empirical results to 
present WM in smart cities.
The main results of the systematic literature review include a discussion 
of WM problems and solutions in smart cities that bring further improve-
ment which would lead toward a sustainable future. This work provides an 
overview of the field, while identifying areas in the smart WM field.
It is important to separate and collect recyclable materials such as food, 
plastic, paper and technological products.
For WM, measurement is another important topic. Measuring waste in 
developing countries is a problem. There is little research done in the con-
text of real-world software ecosystems. AI-based risk management of WM 
users and waste workers could be studied as a topic gap in the field. There 
are also few studies regarding user well-being, persuading users to a behav-

the digital waste area.

128  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
In the literature, there are high-tech products such as unmanned robots 
collecting garbage from rivers (Akib et al., 2019), drones (Almalki et al., 
2021) used in WM. However, these technologies are not applied in environ-
mental management from a socio-technical perspective. While everything is 
designed and implemented in the human environment, concepts such as 
human ease of use and adaptation should be included in the systems. 
Information systems will be successful by being supported by complemen-
tary factors.
Interconnected environmental socio-technical solutions and systems that 
all users (people, institutions, countries and even systems) will approach and 
implement with a sensitive and systematic approach to environmental man-
agement should be implemented urgently.

8.1  INTRODUCTION
Smart cities are characterized by interconnected physical and virtual services 
aimed at simplifying citizens’ activities, the consumption of sustainable pri-
mary resources such as water and energy, and the participation of people in 
decisions that can affect their lives. Smart city ecosystems are threatened by 
a variety of hazards, ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes to 
man-made events such as terrorist attacks. Smart cities and rapid urbaniza-
tion are transforming the way we live. More and more people are living in 

136  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
cities day by day. As cities grow, government agencies invest in infrastruc-
ture and applications to improve citizens’ operations, services, and the over-
all urban experience.
A city can be considered a Smart City if it uses technology to efficiently 
manage its critical infrastructure and deliver public services interactively. 
Today, an increasing number of cities tend to improve their community lives 
by implementing smart city principles. The basic idea is to connect citizens 
to each other, services, infrastructures, and entire organizations to benefit 
from a continuous collective cooperation. In this context, the EM process 
becomes a critical element. The basis of the process is to benefit from the 
cooperation between citizens and organizations in order to reduce emer-
gency risks and response time and to act more efficiently and more con-
sciously. The 21st century contains more risks and dangers than in the past. 
Problems such as global warming and climate changes, natural disasters, 
man-made disasters, urbanization, and terrorism compel us to live in a risk 
society. States, non-governmental organizations, private sector organiza-
tions and citizens are in search of new quests for a safer and more prosper-
ous society. Undoubtedly, these new searches will rise on the basis of 
knowledge and technology in accordance with the requirements of the age 
we live in. EM, which has become a focal point in the field of public admin-
istration, has an important place among urban problems.
8.2 WHAT IS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT?
An emergency can be defined as a concept that creates instant risks to 
health, life, property, or the environment and generally requires immediate 
action to prevent these risks from worsening. Emergencies can be encoun-
tered in all social systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 
an emergency as an event that disrupts normal conditions of existence and 
causes suffering beyond the adaptive capacity of the affected community. 
The systems created to minimize the effects of these situations are called 
EM systems.
The diversity of emergencies encountered (natural disasters, technological 
disasters, terrorism, work accidents, etc.) requires each institution to keep 
the EM system at a certain level and turn it into a set of sustainable mecha-
nisms. Emergencies consist of both natural disasters and man-made disas-
ters. These disasters can be at a level that can destroy important infrastructure 
economies and human security.
EM is a planning and process that has been put forward with the aim of 
minimizing the damages when natural or man-made disasters occur. Within 
the scope of EM, the main purpose of disaster and EM is to prevent death 
and injury, and to protect the environment and property, by using available 
resources for all stages, by making decisions, planning, and analyzing. Errors 
in planning and implementation in EM can cause mass death and injury. 

Emergency management in smart cities  137
Events within the scope of EM can be various events such as terrorism, fire, 
hazardous substance incidents, mass food poisoning, sabotage, work acci-
dent, collapse of communication system, epidemic, earthquake, flood, tsu-
nami, storm, hurricane, riot, famine, drought, and mobilization (Akerkar, 
2020).
The importance of EM includes the ability to identify an event in an emer-
gency, make strategic decisions, and take care of first aid needs. The main 
task in the prevention of an emergency is a fast and accurate response, pro-
tection of human life and damage control. The perspective of practitioners 
and managers on the emergency is critical for prompt and correct action. 
EM includes management activities consisting of various stakeholders to 
prevent and reduce unexpected emergencies, control social damage and 
eliminate post-emergency effects (Chen et al., 2019). EM has four phases: 
mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. This approach has been 
defined as a four-stage, interlocking, and cyclical chain of activities.
The mitigation phase includes activities to reduce emergency risks or the 
likelihood of emergencies by analyzing the measurements related to them. It 
is the architectural, infrastructure, and technological studies carried out to 
reduce or eliminate the damages that may arise from the loss of life and 
property as a result of various hazards and their effects in the long term. The 
mitigation phase includes all structural and non-structural actions done 
before, during, and after a disaster. These activities are long-term studies 
that require a wide range of disciplines to work with many institutions and 
organizations toward a specific goal. The mitigation phase practically starts 
with the activities in the recovery phase. The activities carried out in this 
phase show a very wide application area, at the country, region, and city 
scale.
Some of the tasks to be done at this phase:
	•	 Arrangement of legal legislation to be applied in case of disaster
	•	 Planning and conducting required scientific and institutional studies
	•	 Comprehensive awareness training
Preparedness can be defined as action planning for a possible emergency for 
response and rescue operations. This includes the simulations of the emer-
gency services and the maintenance of training and service equipment. It 
covers activities such as planning against anticipated hazards, resource man-
agement, mutual assistance, public information, and training of response 
personnel.
The response phase is the implementation of the plans made during the 
preparation phase. The activities of this phase occur during an emergency. In 
order to protect and save life and property in the event of a disaster, emer-
gency personnel is responsible for evacuating the victims using equipment 
resources, providing food, drink, shelter, and medical care to those in need, 
and carrying out emergency actions to ensure the operation of critical public 

138  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
services. In a response and rescue situation, people from many different 
organizations are on the ground. EM services have a responsibility to pro-
tect public institutions, people, and immovable property. Police, fire, ambu-
lance, health and emergency medical services, and other associated service 
organizations provide EM services.
The recovery phase defines activities to normalize the situation after an 
emergency. It is the process of restructuring society and individuals after a 
disaster in a way that will enable institutions to work on their own, return 
to normal life, and be protected against possible dangers in the future.
Countries have different approaches to EM. Emergencies and disasters in 
the United States are primarily tried to be resolved at the local level. The 
states and government assist, respectively, when necessary. On the other 
hand, the Disaster and EM Presidency (AFAD) is responsible for the coordi-
nation of disaster and emergency services in Turkey. In Japan, there are two 
separate organizations, one permanent and the other in disaster situations. 
The permanent organization is made at three levels: national, state, and 
municipality. In addition to this permanent organization, there is an emer-
gency crisis center in Japan, which is required by law to be established 
immediately in the event of a disaster.
8.3 WHAT IS A SMART CITY?
The impact of globalization and industrialization, the great paradigm shift it 
caused, has led people to consume the world’s natural resources rapidly. The 
need for cities to become smarter has emerged through the application of 
innovative solutions to find solutions to large-scale urbanization problems 
and find new ways to create livable, competitive, and self-reliant cities.
Smart city refers to the integration of large cities with computing tech-
nologies for efficient and effective management (Mohammad et al., 2019). 
The smart city paradigm is a concept that is applied in an urban scenario 
using information processing technology (ICT) infrastructures covering new 
generation cities and emerged with the latest developments in the field of the 
Internet of Things (IoT). The smart city aims to provide a technologically 
advanced environment that can understand the world by analyzing data to 
improve living conditions. Wireless sensor networks (WSN), IoT, Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID), and other technologies provide the foun-
dation of smart city technological infrastructure. The data created by the 
cities equipped with these technologies require analysis with AI technolo-
gies. Accurate forecasting depends on the success of data analytics and AI 
techniques. The key elements in a smart city are shown in Figure 8.1. EM is 
also part of the smart city concept.
The smart city encompasses technologies to make cities efficient, more 
technologically advanced, greener, and more socially inclusive. It is the 
establishment of processes that make a city smart, together with software 

Emergency management in smart cities  139
systems, network infrastructures, and sensors. Smart cities can offer innova-
tive services for traffic management, smart energy management, smart tour-
ism, smart buildings, smart lighting, smart health, fire, and incident detection. 
Smart cities can dynamically monitor the state of the city by interacting with 
both the city infrastructure and the people living in the city. The information 
gained improves service quality, performance, and interaction while reduc-
ing costs and resource consumption.
In the 21st century, rapid developments in ICTs, advances in sensor tech-
nology, and exponential growth in computing power have increased the 
application of technology in cities over the past two decades. Smart cities 
use devices connected to the IoT network, various software, user interfaces, 
and communication networks to make life easier. IoT is a network of con-
nected devices (vehicles, household appliances, traffic lights, street lights, 
Figure 8.1  Smart city components.

140  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
etc.) that communicate and exchange data between them. Data collected 
from these devices is stored in the cloud or on servers to drive improvements 
in both public and private sector efficiencies and improvements in the lives 
of citizens. Smart cities of the future as an essential element of their 
development
	✓	 Improving the quality of life of citizens
	✓	 Providing alternatives for urban renovation and growth
	✓	 Supporting sustainability initiatives
	✓	 Enhancing the political and representative process
	✓	 Supports economic development
Some typical features of smart cities include
	•	 Common infrastructure for efficient public distribution systems
	•	 Information collection via smart sensors and monitoring/control from 
the central command center
	•	 Open government: closing the gaps between citizen and administration
	•	 Clean and green environment
	•	 Using smart infrastructure systems in communication, energy distribu-
tion, and transportation systems
Most of the population in industrialized countries live in large urban areas, 
which are constantly growing and at the same time affected by an increas-
ing number of emergencies and crises, creating great challenges in our daily 
lives. Any effective smart city implementation proposal must ensure the 
availability of the technology not only during normal operations (lighting, 
parking, etc.) but also during disasters and emergencies to optimally benefit 
the city. EM is a current issue for institutions that want to protect their 
citizens in smart cities. EM deals with the risk and consequences of an emer-
gency and aims to reduce or avoid adverse effects and take effective rescue 
action (De Nicola et al., 2019).
It is the responsibility of public authorities to save lives, restore order, and 
lead emergency operations in crises. This is part of managing crowded cities. 
Therefore, the existence of coordinated EM services is becoming an impor-
tant application in the context of smart cities.
8.4  SMART (IOT) DEVICES FOR EMERGENCY 
MANAGEMENT
The IoT refers to the connection of each device with each other and with 
larger systems. With the developments in low-cost sensor devices, comput-
ing infrastructures, wireless communication networks and web technologies, 
developments in the field of IoT have accelerated. The IoT is a worldwide 

Emergency management in smart cities  141
network created by objects with unique identities, and the objects in this 
network communicate with each other with a specific protocol. A system 
of devices that communicate with each other through communication pro-
tocols and create a smart network by connecting to each other and sharing 
information (Al-Fuqaha et al., 2015; Roblek et al., 2016). The structure 
consisting of sensors, software, actuators, and network connections allows 
devices to collect and exchange data (Patel and Patel, 2016). IoT technology 
assigns a unique ID (UID) to each “object”, making it possible to share data 
with each other and with central control mechanisms without the need for 
any human intervention. The IoT has applications that facilitate the daily 
lives of consumers as well as provide great benefits in corporate, production, 
and industrial areas.
Smart city applications of IoT have gained popularity in recent years. 
Research in this area has focused on exploring the design and implementa-
tion aspects from multiple perspectives, as well as modeling the key features 
of future smart cities. The ability to detect environmental variables is becom-
ing increasingly important in many application scenarios. This trend high-
lights the concept of IoT, which can capture and disseminate all useful 
information from the real world. This approach has led to a variety of appli-
cations. Some applications that can be realized in smart cities with the IoT:
	✓	 Fire extinguishing systems
	✓	 Air pollution control
	✓	 Occupancy of garbage containers controls
	✓	 Parking lot control
	✓	 Noise level control
	✓	 Traffic density control
	✓	 Robustness of water systems controls
	✓	 Human density detection
The connection between the physical and digital worlds is made possible by 
continuous advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing technologies 
such as RFID and sensors. Smart cities can be improved at all stages of EM. 
For example, smart sensors; with an early warning system before a drought, 
flood, landslide or hurricane, it can help to take necessary precautions in a 
timely manner. Sensors detect forest fires, tornadoes, cloud bursts, volcanic 
activity, earthquakes, etc. can detect and send early warning. Air pollution, 
including radioactive conditions, can be monitored with sensors to control 
hazards. The use of IoT devices also enables remote monitoring of strategic 
food, water, clothing, medical equipment and other vital supplies. RFID sys-
tems have been used for asset tracking and human localization.
Early warning in disasters can prevent loss of life and material losses. 
A pre-disaster warning saves time for people to evacuate the area and for 
emergency response teams to take the necessary precautions. Early warning 
systems receive data from real-time sensors. It provides an interactive alert 

142  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
service by presenting the necessary information after processing the data it 
receives.
IoT technologies can contribute before and after a disaster, as well as dur-
ing a disaster. After the disaster, fast and accurate information can be 
obtained about those affected by the disaster. In line with this information, 
emergency response teams can be directed effectively.
Information necessary for first responders to take action can be gathered 
from sensors and IoT-enabled cameras at the scene. IoT systems can be used 
to inform the public in real time. Connected digital signage such as bus 
stops, highways, and city squares can also be used to quickly disseminate 
critical information. In their study, Fedele and Merenda (2020) aimed to 
find the shortest and safest evacuation routes with crowd control in emer-
gency situations in their AI-based studies built on an IoT-based system. On 
the other hand, Kantarci and Mouftah (2014) presented a framework for 
cloud-centric IoT-based crowd management for public safety.
IoT-based sensors placed in buildings can collect and classify the damage 
status of buildings after disasters. In addition, the health status of people 
inside the building can be transmitted to emergency teams from wearable 
sensors such as smartwatches. Monitoring dangerous or inaccessible areas 
with the IoT system is another research area. For some security-critical sys-
tems, remote detection and repair of the managed physical system are essen-
tial. In some emergency situations, the identification of harm and condition 
of people in danger following a natural or man-made disaster can be effec-
tively handled by reliable IoT systems. Infrared cameras and enhanced lis-
tening sensors could aid in the search for survival.
Smart suits equipped with sensors can report firefighters’ vital signs and 
temperatures from the scene when physically very dangerous. It can also be 
equipped with audio and video sensors to enable first responders to evaluate 
the areas they go to for an emergency, remotely, or on their way to the loca-
tion. Infrastructure systems (electricity, water, gas) equipped with IoT sen-
sors can be programmed to turn themselves off in disaster situations. For 
example, gas and electrical systems can shut themselves down in line with 
the information received from the fire sensor in the environment at the time 
of fire.
Wearable sensors can collect real-time health data, gaining valuable infor-
mation about public health. These devices can exchange data among them-
selves, with emergency service centers, hospitals, and other health institutions 
over the internet. The health of people living in smart cities can be moni-
tored as long as they have their own permission.
As the IoT continues to grow, it offers tremendous opportunities to pre-
vent, detect, limit, manage and recover from emergencies. IoT cannot pre-
vent disasters, but it can assist in identifying life-threatening risks, alerting 
authorities early, and assisting in the rescue of individuals impacted, saving 
lives, resources, and money. EM and response may be improved with the 
usage of IoT technologies, resulting in considerably better outcomes.

8.5  IMPORTANCE OF BIG DATA
Big data refers to our ability to collect, process, and analyze multiple sources 
to find insights from massively unstructured datasets (for example, word 
documents, emails, blog posts, multimedia data that cannot be stored in an 
organized manner in social and relational databases). Big data represents a 
new technology paradigm for high-speed, high-volume, and high-variety gen-
erated data (Lee, 2017). Big data technologies are next-generation technolo-
gies and architectures that allow organizations to create economic value by 
discovering, acquiring, and analyzing various sorts of data from many sources 
(Ghobakhloo, 2018). Technological developments allow businesses to use 
expanding large datasets containing heterogeneous formats (structured, semi-
structured, unstructured data) (Gandomi and Haider, 2015). Due to the com-
bination of the following unique features of big data, as illustrated in Figure 
8.2, there are challenges to extract useful information from big data.
The use of available resources and the extraction of valuable information 
from the data obtained are essential for effective EM. The fact that big data 
has different structures from various sources emerges as the difficulty of 
using this data in smart decision-making processes. Timely access to reliable 
and complete information is essential for effective EM. The diversity of data 
from different sources such as IoT technologies, social media and informa-
tion systems, and media requires new perspectives for data storage and pro-
cessing (Iglesias et al., 2020).
The ability of smart cities to process, store and share large amounts of 
data is crucial to improving their resilience and preparedness for natural 
disasters. Cities around the world generate huge amounts of data every day.
Information or insight can be extracted from large datasets for different 
purposes, including predictive, diagnostic, descriptive, and rule-based. The 
Figure 8.2  5 Vs of big data.

144  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
implementation of all these goals for smart cities introduces the concept of 
urban analytics.
There is a lot of data in EM, but it is vital to deal with its nature and figure 
out how to leverage it to use all the information. A better understanding of 
this data is needed as it can help first responders, government agencies, and 
the public prepare for emergencies. Big data is an extremely useful resource 
for learning about the environment. It may contain various data about the 
current state of the environment, such as road conditions, the availability of 
medical assistance, and the location of survivors.
Before the use of big data, some questions need to be answered. The amount 
of data, the purpose for which the data will be used, what processes it will go 
through, and how it will be managed should be answered before the applica-
tion. The complexity is high due to the 5v characteristics. Institutions and 
organizations need to establish big data models in line with their purposes. In 
addition, cloud computing technologies can be used to store data.
With Web 2.0, sharing takes place between all users. This situation has led 
to the development of communication, data sharing, and social media tools 
and has led to the beginning of the information age. The increase in the 
amount of information created by Web 2.0 requires new perspectives to use 
heterogeneous data sources together. Big data analytics tools (Hadoop, 
Spark, Kafka, etc.) have emerged as new methods with visualization appli-
cations (Kibana, Tableau, Plotly, etc.).
CrisMap, a Big Data crisis mapping system that can swiftly collect and 
analyze social media data, is presented by Avvenuti et al. (2018). From 
tweets, the technology retrieves potentially actionable information regard-
ing the problem. This data is then presented on a web-based dashboard to 
aid emergency responders in gaining a better understanding of the situation 
during the early phases of a disaster. Wang et al. (2017) offer an integrated 
disaster management system built using Hadoop and Spark that handles 
large-scale datasets concerns from both a spatial and temporal perspective 
and delivers predictive risk analytics for resource optimization and fire 
response evacuation planning. A study was conducted to provide a frame-
work for mixing multi-source data sources such as social media, remote 
sensing, and Wikipedia to give a flexible catastrophe analysis solution, 
which incorporated Hadoop for spatial data mining and text mining in their 
work (Huang et al., 2017).
8.6 TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR 
EMERGENCY SERVICES
Today, smart traffic is an important part of smart cities. Optimizing traffic 
data sources and ensuring their integration with other public institutions is 
important for improving the level of public service. Intelligent traffic man-
agement, with its structure created with information technologies, aims to 

Emergency management in smart cities  145
ensure that the necessary institutions take safer and smarter decisions in 
case of emergencies, while regulating the usual flow of traffic. In this con-
text, the smart traffic system is used for the following issues.
	o	 event detection
	o	 weather/road condition measurement
	o	 measurement of traffic data
	o	 intersection attendance control
	o	 passenger information/direction
	o	 realizes video management functions
Disaster management systems or emergency response systems are very 
important in a smart city in order to effectively deal with natural disaster 
conditions such as disasters, terrorist attacks, explosions or earthquakes, 
and tsunamis. Traffic plays a key role in evacuating the affected area in the 
event of a disaster, directing emergency vehicles, and monitoring traffic in 
other parts of the city. Traffic data can be collected from sensors and cam-
eras placed on the roads for effective traffic management. In addition, the 
data collected from GPS can also be used to monitor traffic flow and ensure 
people’s safety, avoid traffic jams and provide emergency services effectively 
in the affected area.
During emergencies, it is vital to understand, model, and predict popula-
tion behavior and mobility throughout the city, planning effective transpor-
tation planning, humanitarian relief, and post-disaster management. The 
Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 disrupted public transportation sys-
tems in the Greater Tokyo Area, one of the world’s largest cities. It also 
caused traffic chaos and urban disorder. If city managers can analyze the 
movements of crowds of people, they can make the right direction and pre-
vent chaos.
Each city can establish a smart traffic management system by using the 
IoT, big data, and AI technologies according to its own needs and traffic 
conditions. At this point, an intelligent traffic management system can be 
integrated into emergency services operations. Malik et al. (2018) proposed 
a solution that reduces the waiting times of emergency vehicles in their 
study.
The performance of EM systems is directly related to the existence of 
smart traffic systems, as most of the services in smart cities are realized with 
the road network. AI, big data, and the IoT are also transforming the field 
of EM, depending on smart transportation systems.
Today, the increasing number of vehicles due to population growth has 
led to an unprecedented increase in road traffic congestion, especially in big 
cities. In most major cities around the world, traffic density also has adverse 
effects on individuals, the economy, and the environment, particularly in 
urban areas. The most critical of these is the increase in deaths on the roads 
and significant financial losses due to the delay of emergency vehicles such 

146  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
as ambulances and police cars. To alleviate the impact of this problem, traf-
fic management systems are used in smart cities for a faster response to 
emergency services.
Fires, accidents, natural disasters, or terrorist attacks can occur anywhere 
in the world, with negative consequences. In crowded cities, it can be diffi-
cult to evacuate an area quickly and in a controlled manner (Rego et al., 
2018). Both the regular evacuation of people and the quickest arrival of the 
emergency response teams to the area are achieved with intelligent traffic 
management systems.
The security of these systems is important for the execution of the system. 
Attacks on the system can be used for malicious purposes. A fake ambulance 
can take advantage of a “green passage” through intersections to handle a 
fake emergency case. In addition, keeping citizens and vehicles in the emer-
gency area away from the area is necessary for regular traffic flow (Djahel 
et al., 2013).
8.7 AI AND EM
The term artificial intelligence or AI was developed in computer science to 
describe human-like intelligence and abilities exhibited by machines, such as 
software or simulation of human intelligence in machines.
According to IBM, AI enables computers and machines to mimic the 
human mind’s ability to perceive, learn, solve problems, and make decisions. 
In other words, AI is the process of improving the decision-making pro-
cesses of machines by understanding and responding to requests, identifying 
and learning languages, recognizing objects, and sometimes learning from 
examples through trial and error. For example, a search engine’s ability to 
“translate” a textual query into an image or video relies on AI and AI-enabled 
chatbots to chat with people.
AI plays a large role in the decision-making of public institution managers 
in smart cities. Data from IoT sensors and residents must be processed 
before a decision or forecast can be determined. Traditional rule-based algo-
rithms are not sufficient for such a purpose. Specifically, machine learning 
(ML) is being applied everywhere in smart city applications. ML is a data-
driven approach that self-predicts based on given data.
AI technologies play an important role in making cities and citizens safer, 
making transportation smarter, and optimizing urban planning. AI enables the 
processing of large volumes of datasets using a variety of data sources and high 
speed to support decision making, predict and make recommendations about 
possible future events. AI can be used to deliver a wide range of economic and 
social benefits, from traffic congestion to health and safety. It changes the way 
people living in smart cities interact, work, and live on a daily basis.
AI technology is being integrated into all areas of life. Traditional EM 
strategies are insufficient to deal with disasters and social security events 

Emergency management in smart cities  147
within the new structures of smart cities. Applications that result in the inte-
gration of AI and EM will be more preferred as smart cities increase. Data-
driven EM can perform a variety of tasks using appropriate techniques (ML 
and deep learning) before, during, and after an emergency.
Image and text analytics, speech recognition, chatbot interactions, and 
ML models all have applications for public safety and EM. Big data and AI 
are interconnected. AI refers to a variety of methods to use a non-human 
system to mimic human intelligent behavior. Large amounts of big data can 
be used effectively by AI to develop data predictions and cost-effective smart 
city solutions.
ML, which is a sub-branch of AI, is basically divided into two as super-
vised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the model created by training 
data with certain output classes is used for prediction in new situations. 
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled and unclassified datasets to train and 
query AI networks. In this way, it finds hidden features and hidden patterns 
in the data.
As public safety professionals and communities face multi-layered crises, 
leveraging AI technologies will be increasingly advantageous. However, 
technology should be used responsibly and it is essential that the data be 
accurate so dispatchers can quickly analyze the information and decide how 
best to proceed.
When data is accurate and used responsibly, AI not only has the ability to 
improve public safety, it also ensures the effectiveness of key workers. For 
example, if there is a shortage of staff at a particular peak time, chatbots can 
automatically dispatch teams to address less serious and complex issues. 
This helps relieve the pressure on people and allows them to better focus on 
high-priority events instead. AI systems and voice assistants can sift through 
a large number of calls, determine the sort of occurrence, and confirm the 
location. They can not only naturally connect with callers and process those 
calls, but they can also transcribe and translate languages in real time. AI 
systems can detect urgency in the tone of speech, filtering out redundant or 
less urgent calls and prioritizing them based on the severity of the problem.
Information management becomes very important during emergency 
response operations. EM decision-makers need constant access to a variety of 
distributed data sources to plan, make appropriate decisions, and allocate 
resources for specific tasks. In smart cities, disaster and EM need effective 
coordination and mobilization of first responders to respond intelligently to 
disaster scenarios. There is a need for an information system in which infor-
mation is collected and managed to ensure coordination. The steps of creating 
the information system to be created for decision makers are given below.
	✓	 Data Collection: Collecting data from sources such as social media, 
IOT sensors, cameras, GPS data
	✓	 Data Transfer: Transfer of data with protocols and communication 
technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRaWAN, and 5G

148  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	✓	 Data Storage: Saving the collected data to servers or cloud environ-
ment with different connection types
	✓	 Data Processing and Analysis: Extraction of relevant information by 
AI and similar methods
Response plans help us analyze the possibilities of overcoming a disaster. 
Emergency scenarios can withstand environmental disasters such as oil 
spills, toxic gas spills, floods, or epidemics such as malaria or Covid-19. 
In such emergencies, it is important to design an effective rapid response 
plan that will help reduce damage and save thousands of lives. Emergency 
response decision-makers need to make decisions based on the current situ-
ation and available information sources. Because this provides an opportu-
nity for them to find a better solution.
AI-based systems can support decision-makers in responding to fires in 
businesses, homes, and forests by analyzing data from security cameras, sen-
sors, and other sources. Apart from this, it can provide important support in 
the management of disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and 
epidemics.
In the future, AI will help control the flow of information in emergency 
operations centers and provide important data from a wide variety of 
sources in a new way. With the data received from sensors and unmanned 
aerial vehicles supported by AI techniques such as big data analytics and 
ML, decision support becomes more advanced and situational awareness is 
increased.
Real emergency data are not of good quality due to unstructured data 
from many different sources. There are also redundant, incomplete, noisy, 
inconsistent, and uncertain data. Preprocessing of data is extremely neces-
sary before making a decision, including data cleaning, data transformation, 
data integration to eliminate missing values, deletion of mutation data, and 
possibly merging multiple data to avoid decision-making errors resulting 
from that data.
Yin et al. (2015) stated that valuable information obtained from social 
media is useful for emergencies. Sahoh and Choksuriwong (2021) aimed to 
reveal information after uncertain emergencies by using social media data 
and ML techniques. Spielhofer et al. (2016) aimed to explore what informa-
tion can be extracted from tweets. The results provided useful information 
on flood events.
An ML algorithm was used to investigate the factors affecting the build-
ing occupants’ decision-making at the pre-evacuation stage. It is aimed to 
obtain new information to develop effective evacuation plans for emergency 
managers (Zhao et al., 2020). An intelligent mobile terminal fire evacuation 
system has been created for large public buildings using AI technology. It is 
intended to find the shortest escape route from a building in the event of a 
fire (Jiang, 2019). This study aims to assist resource prioritization decisions 
for disaster response. Images are collected from the earthquake zone. The

wreckage is classified to identify survivors (Chaudhuri and Bose, 2020). In 
the absence of healthcare workers, a classification model is built for survival 
prediction with the capacity to triage individuals swiftly and precisely 
through wearable devices. ML approaches were utilized to evaluate injury 
severity and analyze vital signs (Kim et al., 2018). For emergency reaction 
scenarios, a coordinated decision-making agent is being implemented. 
Reinforcement learning is an ML technique that allows an agent to learn 
from its experiences. The researchers developed a simulation of an emer-
gency for the proof-of-concept, and the representative was given the duty of 
allocating resources to maximize the number of individuals treated at the 
hospital (Lopez et al., 2018).
AI-based forecasting methods are also an important research area in EM. 
The magnitude of earthquakes was estimated in the study utilizing several 
sources of input data (Moustra et al., 2011). Kim and Kim (2020) developed 
a flood hazard rating prediction model that is based on a long short-term 
memory (LSTM) neural network and random forest.
Predictive analytics approaches can help in understanding the economic 
and human consequences of natural disasters. Artificial neural networks use 
data from the geography, country, and type of natural catastrophe to fore-
cast the financial impact of natural disasters.
As a result of developing technologies and advances in AI, the perspective 
on EM in smart cities is changing. In this direction, an EM framework for 
smart cities is drawn in Figure 8.3.
Data collected from social media, smart city sensors, traffic cameras, and 
external sensors constitute big data for use in EM. Instant smart monitoring 
and decision-making systems can be developed with AI-supported

techniques based on this data. During an emergency, traffic management 
and informing the public can be carried out quickly and accurately in order 
to direct the emergency teams, to reach the scene as quickly as possible.
8.8  CHAPTER SUMMARY
Smart cities are becoming a basic necessity for most countries in the world 
as populations migrate to big cities. Smart cities aim to provide better service 
by using the advantages of technology together with the crowded popula-
tion. In this way, it can use its resources more efficiently, make more effective 
decisions, and offer an environmentally sustainable life. The main technolo-
gies expected to be used in the creation of smart cities are cloud computing, 
IoT technologies, big data, AI, and advanced analytics.
Today, an increasing number of cities are taking various steps toward 
becoming smart city. The purpose of the smart city is to connect citizens to 
each other, services, infrastructures, and political and non-political 
organizations.
Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas. Huge fires broke out in Australia and 
the Amazon. Different parts of the world were shaken by severe earth-
quakes. India and different countries surrendered to severe flooding. America 
experienced the September 11 attacks. Natural disasters are causing rising 
amounts of damage all around the world, which is painfully clear. New 
technologies that can analyze large volumes of data hold great promise for 
assisting community leaders and EM in making better judgments. These 
AI-based technologies can be used to supplement and improve existing 
disaster response strategies. AI should be an essential part of disaster 
response programs as floods, earthquakes, fires, and accidents will cause 
increasing amounts of damage in the future.
In this context, the EM process becomes a critical dimension. The key 
components of a smart city are technology, people, and institutions. When 
community services are combined with ICT infrastructures, a city is truly 
smart and promotes sustainable growth and improves the quality of life. It 
is important to use sensors, big data analytics and IoT technologies together 
to realize an intelligent emergency system. In the event of an accident or 
natural disaster, obtaining accurate information, analyzing data quickly and 
efficiently, and transmitting information to relevant institutions are essential 
to save as many lives as possible. It is, therefore, crucial to establish an effi-
cient information exchange system that shares information between rescu-
ers, allowing for faster response and providing operational instructions for 
rescuers.
Table 8.1 lists the studies on IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence tech-
nologies in smart cities regarding the four phases of EM.
EM has become an important and growing discipline in the world with 
smart cities and developing technology. The concept of smart city has a 

Emergency management in smart cities  151
significant impact on EM, as in every field. Advances in artificial intelligence, 
big data, and IoT also offer opportunities to meet the need for effective EM. 
Artificial intelligence technologies can cope with the big data created by 
smart cities, create models with this data and contribute to the creation of 
systems that smart cities need. In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in integrating AI technologies into EM for a variety of tasks. 
However, it needs to be equipped with more IoT sensors to collect data from 
smart cities for effective decision support. EM is a highly dynamic and com-
plex process. Making critical decisions under dynamic and constantly 
changing conditions can be challenging. Realistic implementation of EM 
systems is challenged throughout the design, implementation, and operation 
phases.
The challenges faced by such systems are listed below.
	•	 Design and operating cost
	•	 Heterogeneity across devices
	•	 Massive data collection and analysis
	•	 Information security
	•	 Sustainability

9.1  INTRODUCTION
Smart cities are the cities that provide sustainable development by provid-
ing smart and sustainable solutions and enhance their residents’ quality of 
life by using information and communication technologies. Considering the 
rate of urbanization, it is predicted that 68% of the world’s population will 
live in cities by 2050, which means 2.5 billion people will be added to urban 
areas (UN, 2018). It is inevitable that this projected increase will create a 
great deal of pressure on existing infrastructures, resources, sustainability, 
and overall life quality in cities. While the investments made to enhance the 
infrastructures of cities around the world were approximately $550 billion 
in 2016, depending on these circumstances, it is estimated that this amount 
will increase to $2.57 trillion by 2025 and to $41 trillion by 2037. This 
rapid growth in the global smart cities market is the indicative of the ten-
dency to regard smart cities as opportunities for digital technology invest-
ments (Anand and Navio-Marco, 2018).
Traditionally, infrastructure investments in cities have been financed by 
public funds. The fact that infrastructure is in the public interest by defini-
tion has led governments to be the key actors in these investments. However, 
the inability to make the necessary investment expenditures due to public 
budget deficits, high amounts of public debt, and lack of knowledge and/or 
competence of the public sector has led to a decrease in the level of public 
funds allocated to infrastructure in many economies. No infrastructure 
project, smart or not, can be developed without adequate funding resources. 
Therefore, financial dimension is probably the most important factor pre-
venting meaningful smart city projects from being implemented and decreas-
ing the likelihood of ongoing projects being successfully completed. 
Sustainable infrastructures require sustainable financing resources. However, 
their high costs necessitate strategic and comprehensive plans to find and 
secure the most appropriate sources of financing. While potential investors 
want to know the possible return on their investments, the city government 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  157
wants to improve the livability, safety, technology, and mobility of the city. 
It is necessary to harmonize these different demands.
In this chapter, the financial sustainability of smart cities is discussed by 
revealing the features that distinguish smart infrastructure financing from 
ordinary infrastructure financing. Financial continuity requires consider-
ation of both economic efficiency and social and environmental sustainabil-
ity. Instruments that can be used in smart infrastructure financing are 
classified into two separate groups as traditional and innovative. While tra-
ditional financing instruments rely mostly on public resources, innovative 
instruments require the participation of the private sector and individuals.
Smart cities are structures that contain many concepts and sectors, 
equipped with learning objects and systems aimed at making life more effi-
cient and productive. Especially with the introduction of the concept of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) into our lives, access to a huge amount of data has 
become possible. This data has been integrated with artificial intelligence 
(AI) technologies such as deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and 
natural language processing (NLP) and has enabled traditional products 
and services to gain a new dimension integrated with technology. Investment 
processes and financing instruments are no exception. Finally, in this chap-
ter, the use of AI technologies in smart city investment decisions and deter-
mining financial and non-financial returns are discussed, and two new 
AI-based financing instruments, data monetizing and tokenization, are 
described.
9.2  DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF SMART CITY 
FINANCE
Although smart cities are extremely necessary and useful, these features 
do not prevent some problems from arising in their implementation pro-
cess. One of them is how to finance smart cities. The difference between 
smart city financing and traditional city financing results from the inclu-
sion of the technology element in the system. A smart city necessitates high 
investment expenditures and, consequently, sufficient funding sources for 
the installation and subsequent operation and maintenance of technologi-
cally advanced infrastructures (Anand and Navio-Marco, 2018; Lam and 
Yang, 2020; Jonek-Kowalska and Wolniak, 2021). Smart city projects can 
be financed by public, private, or hybrid models that are a combination of 
the two. However, technological solutions in these projects can deter the 
public sector with their high costs on the one hand and private investors 
with uncertainty regarding their long-term returns on the other.
Infrastructure projects are generally expected to be financed and managed 
by the public sector, as it is the primary duty and responsibility of govern-
ments to look after the well-being of their citizens. Although smart city proj-
ects are no different in this sense, public budgets are rarely sufficient to finance 

158  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
them. When city governors try to match the cost of solving urban problems 
with their existing resources, they often realize that their current budget is not 
enough to deal with all of them. In other words, there is usually a budget defi-
cit between the cost of urban development and the city budgets. As citizens’ 
expectations of quality of life and urban population increase, this gap increases 
even more. Although smart infrastructure systems will help reduce operating 
costs and increase efficiency later on, the size of the installation cost of these 
systems can play a deterrent role for public authorities. Local governments, 
which are already unable to invest their scarce resources, may give up on 
projects due to possible additional costs, even though they have seen the long-
term benefits of smart city applications. In addition, although the develop-
ment of smart cities has gained great momentum worldwide, there are also 
doubts about the eventual importance of smart projects and the value that 
smart technologies will add to the city (Galati, 2018).
On the other hand, it is difficult to secure investors as smart city invest-
ments are often extensive and costly (Galati, 2018). Private investors want to 
know the potential return on their investments before allocating funds to 
smart projects or programs. The fact that the possible return on investment 
(ROI) in these projects will usually be provided in the long term, and in some 
cases, even though the project provides social and/or environmental benefits, 
but will not provide any financial returns, may reduce the enthusiasm of the 
private sector and individual investors. In financing smart city projects, hybrid 
models consisting of a combination of public and private investors seem like 
a reasonable solution, but the most fundamental problem with these models 
is the difference between the objectives of the parties. While the goal and the 
duty of the public are to ensure the well-being of its citizens by providing 
services, the goal of private enterprises is to meet individual needs and maxi-
mize profitability. In practical terms, these contrasting priorities are not easy 
to reconcile (Jonek-Kowalska and Wolniak, 2021; Lam and Yang, 2020).
In summary, the inadequacy of public investment capacity, the timidity of 
private investors because of risks, and the difficulties of achieving unity of 
goals in hybrid models can make it difficult to implement smart city proj-
ects. Therefore, smart city finance requires creative thinking and innovative 
instruments different from traditional methods of infrastructure financing 
(Hamilton and Zhu, 2017; Blanck and Ribeiro, 2021; Hodzic and Paleka, 
2020). In this context, it is necessary to reveal all potential financing options 
and to determine which source or combination of resources offers the best 
financial solution (Galati, 2018).
9.3  FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF SMART CITIES
Considering the amount of investment and level of expertise needed for the 
advancement of smart cities, it is obvious that the traditional public adminis-
tration perspective is no longer sufficient. Due to public financial constraints 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  159
and unsustainable business models, many projects have either never started 
or have not been completed. In order to build sustainable infrastructures, 
sustainable financial models that include multiple applications, intermediar-
ies, and creative perspectives are needed (Anand and Navio-Marco, 2018; 
Saunders and Baeck, 2015).
In this context, it is possible to see smart cities as one of the indicators of 
neoclassical globalization and as a reflection of the philosophy of “new pub-
lic management”, where urban problems are transformed into opportunities 
for corporate investment and profit, and areas previously occupied mainly 
by local government institutions are opened to the participation of new 
institutional actors (Anand and Navio-Marco, 2018).
The basis of traditional finance theory emphasizes that investors act ratio-
nally and that stakeholder value is maximized by seeking the optimum com-
bination of financial return and risk. In other words, traditional finance 
focuses on financial return and profitability, isolates itself from the society 
and environment of which it is a part, and measures social well-being only 
in terms of economic efficiency.
The dispute between financial and non-financial values is a fundamental 
conflict at the core of the dominant view. The inefficacy of existing financial 
structures and regulations to deal with sustainability challenges such as 
social justice, unemployment, pollution, and global warming has highlighted 
the need to rethink the role of finance. In this sense, finance has to consider 
social and environmental sustainability as well as economic efficiency 
(Sandberg, 2015; Zhan and de Jong, 2018; UNEP, 2015). Sustainable finance 
deals with how investment and lending decisions that underpin finance 
interact with economic, social, and environmental issues. This perspective is 
based on the view that investors have mixed values and every investment 
activity has mixed results that include non-financial as well as financial 
returns (Fullwiler, 2017). While determining shareholder value, social and 
environmental returns are evaluated as well as financial returns. Therefore, 
sustainable finance theory does not only focus on financial success but also 
measures company performance in terms of social and environmental 
aspects (Elkington, 1994; Zhan and de Jong, 2018; Schoenmaker, 2017; 
Schoenmaker and Schramade, 2019).
Considering social and environmental issues while making investment 
decisions has revealed the concept of “impact investment”. Impact invest-
ment is an approach where mixed values are melted in the same pot. It refers 
to investments that produce measurable positive social and/or environmen-
tal impact in addition to financial return and occurs when an investment is 
made intentionally to derive both a financial return and an auxiliary social 
and/or environmental benefit (Zhan and de Jong, 2018; Bugg-Levine and 
Emerson, 2011; Hebb, 2013; O’Donohoe et al., 2010).
The mission of smart cities has taken an evolutionary path over time, 
from being a leader in technology to achieving social and/or environmental 
goals besides technological leadership. Moreover, the process of creating 

160  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
smart cities has transformed from the top-down initiation of innovations by 
the public to a bottom-up approach by entrepreneurs (Lam and Yang, 2020). 
Rising public consciousness and political participation have led to an 
increase in capital allocated to investment opportunities that take sustain-
ability issues into account, namely in impact investments (UNEP, 2015). 
However, while many global companies, such as IBM, Alcatel-Lucent, 
Schneider, Siemens, Oracle, Microsoft, etc., have entered this market, most 
smart city investments are still based on public financing. Deloitte’s study, 
which is based on European Commission data, reveals that while 49% of 
projects for smart sustainable cities are publicly funded, only 10% are pri-
vately funded. 41% of these projects are financed by public–private partner-
ships (PPPs) (Skowron and Flynn, 2018). These findings suggest that the 
private sector is not so keen on transferring funds to smart cities without 
public support and cooperation (Anthopoulos et al., 2016).
It is essential to establish incentive mechanisms to enable the private sec-
tor and citizens to take part in smart city projects. Often, this incentive is 
financial and can be provided through innovative business models and 
financing methods. Diversified and high-yield financing channels and finan-
cial instruments will make it attractive to transfer funds to smart city proj-
ects (He et al., 2020). Besides, the more sensitive approach of private sector 
enterprises to environmental and social sustainability issues will enhance 
their public image, which will create a gravitational pull that will attract 
people who are considering investing in these enterprises (Lam and Yang, 
2020). In addition, high scores in sustainability indicators can also affect 
financial performance positively (Zhan and de Jong, 2018). The government 
plays a very important role in attracting investors. Public participation 
strengthens the perception by private investors that the project is beneficial, 
effective, and will add value to society. The public’s ownership of most of 
the land and natural resources is also a very important factor in this respect. 
In this context, the function of the public can be defined as “risk 
mitigator”.
Access to sustainable financing requires creative expression of the social, 
economic, and political value proposition parameters that define the prod-
uct or service to be offered, as well as a transparent and clear presentation 
of the cost and revenue sharing structure of the project (Walravens and 
Ballon, 2013). Vilajosana et al. (2013) proposed a three-stage model for 
ensuring effective access to funding sources. The first stage is based on the 
delivery of technologies and services that offer both benefits and a very clear 
ROI in the short to medium term. This phase essentially forms the techno-
logical basis of the city and demonstrates the viability of the smart city to 
investors by generating cash streams for new investments. The next stage 
involves expanding technologies and services that require greater capital 
investment, provide longer-term ROI, or provide only societal and/or envi-
ronmental impact without any financial gain. The infrastructure created in 
the first stage triggers new investments by generating cash in the second

stage. The third stage is based on data availability through standardized 
APIs offered by the implemented platforms. This phase aims to make the 
system self-sustainable by developing services on the city’s existing infra-
structure and incorporating the entire value chain through standardized 
APIs. At this stage, new investors offering new smart services to the city by 
making use of the data produced by the existing infrastructures join the 
game (Vilajosana et al., 2013).
It is obvious that ensuring the sustainability of smart projects and gener-
ating positive results for citizens, investors, and city administration often 
require multiple funding streams. The increase in financing needed for the 
development of sustainable infrastructures necessitates the diversification of 
funding sources with models that require strong collaboration between vari-
ous public and private stakeholders (Zhan and de Jong, 2018). The financ-
ing of sustainable infrastructures is based on the sustainability of financial 
resources as well as the existence of these resources, hence the combination 
of lending and investment strategies (Meltzer, 2016; Z/Yen Group and 
WWF, 2015). Ultimately, without adequate and sustainable financing 
sources, the smart city dream will remain just a “dream”.
9.4  FINANCING METHODS FOR SMART CITIES
Infrastructure, as an asset class, is characterized by high capital intensity, 
long ROI, low liquidity, complexity, and significant social spillover effects 
(Walter, 2016; Tian et al., 2020). Funding smart infrastructure projects is 
expensive anywhere in the world and requires creative approaches. The 
instruments used to finance smart city projects can be classified into two 
groups as traditional and innovative instruments.
In this section, 17 financing vehicles that can be used for funding smart 
infrastructure investments are explained. Each country/state has its own 
rules and regulations regarding capital markets, money markets, and invest-
ment processes. Therefore, not every financial instrument described here is 
available in all of them. However, considering the development of smart 
cities, it is possible for governments to incorporate financing instruments 
that are not available in their own countries/states, but which are more suit-
able for smart technology investments and appear to produce efficient 
results, into their own financial systems by making the necessary 
arrangements.
9.4.1 Traditional financing methods
Providing smart solutions and services through smart infrastructure invest-
ments, achieving sustainable development goals, and improving life quality 
in cities are largely dependent on the financial capacities of cities as well as 
sophisticated technologies (Hodzic and Paleka, 2020; Jonek-Kowalska and 

162  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Wolniak, 2021). Traditional financing relies on municipalities to finance a 
city’s physical infrastructure and urban projects by using cash flows from 
their own assets (e.g., taxes, fees, rental income) or using cash flows through 
transfers from other public institutions (e.g., grants) or by borrowing 
money. The public naturally has full control of the project as it provides all 
the funding itself. Traditional financing instruments include traditional debt 
instruments such as bonds, bank loans, and leases, as well as grants from 
other governmental (or federal) and/or municipal public entities, and funds 
from international organizations. The resulting fund is used to cover project 
costs. Debt instruments usually have a nonpayment period in which the bor-
rower is exempt from repayment until the project is realized. Once it is com-
pleted, becomes operational, and provides a revenue flow, the proceeds are 
used to repay the principal and interest of the debt. This process presumes 
that the project is of a certain scale, is involved in key sectors (e.g., water, 
transportation, energy, information, and communication technology) and 
that the revenue stream from the asset is allocated only to the payment of 
the debt. Public financing is one of the first financing choices generally taken 
into consideration for smart city projects and is a critical component that 
determines the likelihood of the project being realized as originally planned 
(Galati, 2018).
9.4.1.1  Governmental (or federal) and/or municipal grants 
and subsidies
Grants are direct and non-refundable monetary aid transferred from bud-
gets for the realization of a particular project or program. Basically, the main 
source of public budgets is collected taxes and fees. The size of these funds 
is directly proportional to the economic development level of the region. 
Therefore, the higher levels of city budgets in developed countries naturally 
facilitate the implementation of smart city projects (Jonek-Kowalska and 
Wolniak, 2021). However, the fact that the investment amounts required for 
smart city projects are usually very high makes it very difficult to meet all of 
them with public budgets, even in developed countries.
The Smart Cities Challenge is an organization by the Government of 
Canada where ideas to better its inhabitants’ lives through innovation, data, 
and connected technology compete. Each participating community should 
define a challenge statement and summarize the result it aims to achieve. 
The city that wins the grand prize receives $50 million (Infrastructure 
Canada, 2021).
The aim of India’s Smart Cities Mission is to build 100 smart cities and 
modernize the other 500 cities as a development model in the country that 
was launched in 2015. Although it is mainly a centrally sponsored program, 
it also requires state governments and urban local bodies to contribute an 
equal amount for implementing projects under the Smart City Proposal. 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  163
Under Union Budget 2021–22, the Smart Cities Mission has been allocated 
6,450 crore ($868 million) (The Government of India, 2021).
9.4.1.2  Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds (munis) are debt securities issued by government agen-
cies such as states, cities, and counties to finance routine work that must be 
done, services that must be provided to citizens on a regular basis, and city-
related infrastructure projects. They refer to the money that investors lend 
to the government to be repaid with a determined interest at the end of a 
certain maturity. Interest payments may be made at maturity or in the form 
of regular payments in interim periods. While the maturity of short-term 
bonds is typically between 1 and 3 years, the maturity of long-term bonds 
can exceed ten years. It is an advantage for the investor that the interest 
on municipal bonds is generally exempt from income tax. The two most 
common types of municipal bonds are general obligation (GO) bonds and 
revenue bonds.
9.4.1.2.1  General obligation bonds
GO bonds are generally issued to finance basic infrastructure investments 
such as schools, hospitals, and parks. The sale of bonds provides immedi-
ate capital for project construction. An important feature of GO bonds is 
that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing municipality, 
which means their payments are guaranteed by tax revenues and operating 
revenues. GO bond interest income is exempt from taxation as long as it is 
sold to finance an asset with significant benefits to society. This exemption 
makes GO bonds an attractive tool for buyers. Since it is a very low-risk 
instrument, its yield is lower than other bonds.
It is one of the popular tools used to finance smart city initiatives. The 
City of Miami Beach, for example, issued $439 million of voter approved 
GO bonds in 2019 to improve infrastructure through smart city projects 
(The Government of Miami Beach, 2019). In order to mitigate the negative 
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, the Denver munici-
pality plans to issue $450 million of GO bonds in 2022 to fund smart infra-
structure projects that are estimated to create 7,500 jobs and generate $1 
billion in economic output (The Government of Denver, 2021).
9.4.1.2.2  Revenue bonds
GO bond repayments are guaranteed by tax revenues and operating revenues 
of the municipality, while revenue bond repayments are made with the proceeds 
from the asset it finances. Projects related to income-generating services such 
as parking lots, water, gas, and electricity are suitable to be financed with rev-
enue bonds. In revenue bonds, there is no guarantee that tax and operational 

164  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
revenues will be used to cover the deficit in payments if the revenue gener-
ated from the asset is not sufficient. As with GO bonds, revenue bond interest 
income is exempt from taxation if it is issued to finance a capital asset that 
provides substantial benefits to society. Revenue bonds have a higher risk than 
GO bonds, and therefore, interest rates tend to be slightly higher.
New Mexico issued $20 million of revenue bonds to finance a project to 
increase energy efficiency in schools. 90% of the revenue from the energy 
savings generated as the result of the project was used for bond repayments 
(Smart Cities Council, 2015). Similarly, San Antonio issued $153.4 million 
of revenue bonds in 2020 for the renewal and development of its water sys-
tem. The repayments of the bonds will be made with the fees collected from 
the people who use public-supply water, that is, almost all city residents 
(The Government of San Antonio, 2020).
9.4.1.3  Industrial revenue bonds
Industrial revenue bonds (IRBs) are debt securities issued by state and local 
governments on behalf of a private sector company aimed at financing proj-
ects that encourage existing and/or new businesses and promote employ-
ment. These projects may include capital improvements, expansions, facility 
improvements, and energy efficiency upgrades. One of the primary objec-
tives of a municipality is to improve the economic and employment condi-
tions of the city, and through issuing IRBs, it is ready to finance a project 
aimed at these purposes and issue tax breaks to the company undertaking 
it. The proceeds from the sale of bonds are transferred to the investing com-
pany. The company, not the municipality, is responsible for the repayment 
of the debt. The municipality holds the asset as collateral until the debt is 
repaid. Therefore, there is usually no property tax on this asset, and this 
makes IRBs an attractive source of financing for the private sector.
The city of Illinois issued a $25 million IRB for improvements and invest-
ments in Elmhurst College’s campus accommodation facilities to reduce 
energy and water costs and achieve LEED (The Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) certification. The bond is reimbursed from fees paid 
by students who choose to live in these upgraded facilities. The college is 
responsible for ensuring that an adequate number of students live in these 
facilities to meet the bond debt (Illinois Finance Authority, 2008). In 2021, 
the municipality of Wichita approved MWCB’s $20 million IRB request to 
support the construction of the Deloitte Smart Factory. The project, created 
in collaboration with Deloitte and Wichita State University, aims to help 
companies accelerate their digital transformation (Deloitte, 2021).
9.4.1.4  Bank loans and leases
Sustainable smart cities require the close cooperation of the banking sector, 
and in this context, banks play a crucial role in project financing. Extensive 
use of bank funds requires an advanced financial system.

Sustainable financing of smart cities  165
One of the methods widely used in financing is bank loans. It provides 
long-term financing opportunities based on the cash streams, which the 
project will generate in the future. The ease of access makes bank loans a 
good instrument to finance a smart city project. The structuring of the proj-
ect, collateral structure, maturity structure, and repayment method may 
vary depending on the bank and the characteristics of the project.
Leasing is a financing method that ensures that the ownership of an 
investment property remains with the leasing company and the right of use 
is given to the lessee in return for the determined rents and that the owner-
ship is transferred to the lessee at the end of the period specified in the con-
tract. Leasing rather than buying property or equipment provides flexibility 
and reduces the initial cost of the project. In this sense, leasing is one of the 
attractive financing methods.
9.4.1.5  International organizations’ funds
International organizations such as the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB) approach issues such as environment, sus-
tainability, and climate change sensitively and provide funding for projects 
that will pave the way for sustainable development. Beyond funding projects 
such as sustainable practices, smart technologies, and renewable energy sys-
tems in countries and regions all over the world, whether developed, devel-
oping, or underdeveloped, they also provide technical expertise on how best 
to implement these changes in a way that integrates local traditions and 
practices. However, obtaining funds from these highly selective institutions 
involves long procedural processes.
9.4.2  Innovative financing methods
Since it is primarily the duty of governments to improve the living conditions 
of their citizens, smart city projects are often managed by the public sector, 
but in most cases, public funds are insufficient, making it very difficult to 
implement smart projects as desired and in a timely manner. The realiza-
tion of sustainable projects depends on the financial sustainability, which is 
directly related to the diversification of financing resources and the creation 
of innovative business models. Moreover, given the opportunities that the 
formation of sustainable smart cities offers to visionary entrepreneurs and 
the size of the market, the interest of private companies in smart projects is 
not surprising. In this context, most governments invite the private sector 
and city residents to participate in the financing of smart projects, and they 
generally respond positively to these invitations as these projects will pro-
vide economic and/or social and/or environmental benefits.

166  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Innovative financing instruments include PPPs, crowdfunding, green 
bonds, social impact bonds (SIBs), pay-for-performance, user fees, land-
value capture (LVC), tax-increment financing (TIF), data monetizing, and 
venture philanthropy. It should be noted that any project usually requires 
the existence of multiple sources of funding. Smart city projects are no 
exception. It is possible to finance smart projects by combining traditional 
and/or innovative financial instruments in different ways.
9.4.2.1  Public–private partnerships
Public-private partnerships – sometimes referred to as PPPs or P3s – are 
agreements between two or more public and private entities, which enable 
the parties to jointly use certain skills and assets they possess to provide 
a service. PPPs, which is in the spectrum between the provision of public 
services entirely by public authorities and the provision of them only by the 
private sector, is an upper concept that includes the models of goods produc-
tion and services delivery realized with the co-participation of public and 
private actors. PPPs diversify the access to financial resources and capital 
without increasing debts or by creating only a small increase in the debts 
of local governments and ensure the continuity of the project with long-
term commitments. In addition, local governments benefit from the finan-
cial resources and expertise of the private entity while maintaining strategic 
control over the project or the service. On the private sector side, the pos-
sibility of growth and increase in profitability, as well as the opportunity 
of sharing venture risk make the cooperation with public agencies attrac-
tive (Lam and Yang, 2020; Belissent, 2010). In order for the PPP model to 
work, it is essential to reconcile the public interest with the profit maximiza-
tion objective of the private sector companies. The private sector wants to 
finance only commercially eligible projects which generate sufficient returns 
for the risks undertaken. The return on risk represents the opportunity cost 
of forgone alternative investments (Huston et al., 2015). Accordingly, a bal-
anced distribution of responsibilities, risks, and rewards is required among 
all parties. Creating an appropriate PPP model that meets the interests of 
both the private and the public sectors can be a key to raising large funds 
by diversifying financing sources, improving efficiency, and implementing 
projects faster and more effectively (Kavta and Yadav, 2017; Lam and Yang, 
2020). Therefore, PPPs seem to be an important way out in financing smart 
city initiatives.
As the boom of smartphones made them idle, New York City turned its 
network of 8,400 payphones, which were attracting fewer and fewer users, 
into billboards. However, in 2013, it decided to replace them due to the 
decrease in annual advertising revenues and their unsightly appearance. The 
contract was awarded to the CityBridge consortium, comprising Qualcomm, 
Titan, and Control Group. In 2014, New York City and the consortium 
began replacing phones with smart kiosks called “Links”, which provide 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  167
services like free high-speed Wi-Fi, device charging, city maps, transporta-
tion updates, and sensors to monitor environmental data. CityBridge spent 
approximately $200 million on this transformation. With support from 
advertising revenues, the city provides the entire system to the city free of 
charge, receiving 50% of gross advertising revenue or $17.5 million (which-
ever is higher) from CityBridge every year. The city estimates its share of 
advertising revenues in the venture’s first 12 years will reach $500 million. 
In addition to generating revenue flow for the city, the project is expected to 
create 100–150 full-time jobs and 650 support jobs when completed 
(CityBridge, 2021).
The San Jose, California municipality implemented the SmartPoles proj-
ect under a PPP contract with Philips and LM Ericsson. SmartPoles are poles 
that bring together energy-efficient LED lighting by Philips and fully inte-
grated 4G LTE wireless technology by LM Ericsson. These poles, which save 
energy and increase safety in the neighborhood, include a wireless system 
that informs the city if the light goes out or someone gives damage to them. 
In addition, mobile network operators can improve data coverage and 
capacity by renting space on the poles, which will result in improved mobile 
broadband services (The Government of San Jose, 2016).
9.4.2.2  Crowdfunding
The concept of crowdfunding was first described by De Buysere et al. (2012) 
as “the collective effort of many individuals who network and pool their 
resources to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations”. 
Crowdfunding is a smart financing method that emerges from the com-
bination of “sharing economy” and “smart city” concepts, and it enables 
the resources collected from the public crowd through online platforms to 
be used effectively for a common purpose, such as financing of a project 
(Miglietta and Parisi, 2017). The implementation of this method necessitates 
reaching a vast number of people, which requires the existence of a digital 
connectivity infrastructure. Crowdfunding promotes small- or large-scale 
smart urban projects of public authorities, private firms, civic entrepreneurs, 
and non-profit organizations by leveraging the empathy, sense of duty, and 
sense of belonging to a community, therefore encouraging partnerships 
among a wide range of actors (Carè et al., 2018). The biggest weakness of 
this method is that it is difficult to finance expensive projects due to the lim-
ited financial capacities of individuals (Trachenko et al., 2020).
It is inherently impossible to finance all projects that call for financial sup-
port by taking part in social platforms with this method, and only projects 
that reach the specified threshold, which is the minimum amount required 
for the project, are initiated. The existence of the threshold ensures that 
available resources are directed only to plausibly profitable projects con-
firmed and favored by investors. Those who support projects that do not 
achieve the predetermined threshold are fully reimbursed. This threshold 

168  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
value also indicates the risk of failure of the project. Since a crowd is made 
up of people who are both investors and potential consumers simultane-
ously, they often do not find projects attractive as investors that they do not 
find attractive as consumers. In this sense, while providing the funds needed 
for the realization of the project, it also constitutes an indicator of the per-
ception of the market regarding the project. Therefore, crowdfunding greatly 
limits the risk of failure by eliminating weak projects and supporting proj-
ects with a higher potential to succeed (Miglietta and Parisi, 2017).
Crowds can provide financial support as a donation or to provide a finan-
cial benefit. The benefit can be in the form of repayment of the invested 
funds after a while with interest, or it can be in the form of benefiting from 
the goods/services that will be created with the completion of the project at 
a discounted price or being a partner in the project.
Citizen Solar is a smart city initiative aimed at improving Vienna’s solar 
power generation and use. Citizens of Vienna participate in the development 
of renewable energy by investing in crowdfunded solar power plants (The 
City of Vienna, 2012). A similar example of entrepreneurship is Brighton 
Energy Coop., a community-led organization promoting renewable energy 
in the United Kingdom. Funded by its members, which is the crowd, the 
company owns solar photovoltaic systems worth more than £3 million. 
Members receive free energy in return for their investments, a 5% annual 
return on their investments, and a 30% tax deduction on the invested 
amount (Brighten Energy Coop, 2021).
9.4.2.3  Green bonds
Green bonds are fixed-income special-purpose bonds that aim to raise funds 
for eco-friendly initiatives. In particular, they are issued to finance capital-
intensive projects with longer implementation and operational lifetimes, 
targeting efficient energy, pollution prevention, clean water and sustainable 
water management, sustainable agriculture, protection of aquatic and ter-
restrial ecosystems, and clean transportation.
While the green bond issuance was only $2.6 billion in 2012, this amount 
reached approximately $297 billion in 2020 (Climate Bonds Initiative, 
2021). The Federal National Mortgage Association, which is also known as 
Fannie Mae, is a United States government-sponsored enterprise, and it has 
become the biggest green bond issuer of 2020 with a total issuance of $13 
billion. Its Multifamily Green mortgage-based security tool consists of green 
bonds backed by properties with Green Building Certifications and U.S. 
rental housing stock that implemented efficiency improvements. These 
bonds support the Single-Family and Multifamily housing markets by 
financing homes that meet energy and water savings standards (Fannie Mae, 
2021).

Sustainable financing of smart cities  169
9.4.2.4  Social impact bonds
SIBs, also called Pay for Success, are contracts that provide returns based on 
the degree to which the desired result is achieved, unlike traditional bonds 
that offer a fixed rate of return. The SIB payment is dependent on the social 
outcomes agreed upon by the investor and the issuer. Most SIBs are for 
environmental, social, and governance purposes. If the targets are met, the 
investors get returns on the bonds. If the targets are not met, investors may 
lose all their investments or only get some of them back under the terms of 
the contract. In this sense, SIB investors who assume the risk of creating a 
determined social impact consist of people who are interested not only in 
financial return but also in social impact. So far, SIBs have only been issued 
by government entities, but it is possible for private sector entities to issue 
SIBs as well. The first SIB in the world was issued in the United Kingdom 
in 2010. As of December 2021, there are 138 SIBs issued in 25 countries 
worldwide, worth more than $441 million (Social Finance, 2021).
The Sticking Together SIB was issued in April 2019, with a total value of 
A$5 million to finance a project to increase employment for disadvantaged 
young people in New South Wales. The project uses a coaching model to 
improve these young people’s engagement with the workforce by making 
them engage more in productive activities. The project focuses on the devel-
opment of non-professional skills that hinder employment, such as difficul-
ties in establishing relationships, and is designed to assist more than 800 
unemployed youth aged 18 to 24 with high barriers to employment, such as 
disability or mental health problems, criminal convictions, or lack of a per-
manent home, in three designated regions for 60 weeks. It is expected to 
result in an increase in lifetime earnings and a decrease in the use of govern-
mental services. Interest payments will be made using a fixed effective rate 
of 3% for the first two years of the project. For the next three years, interest 
payments will be calculated at a variable rate depending on the project’s 
performance. The target return on the project is 7% per year. Principal 
repayment depends in part on project outcomes. If hours spent on work or 
work-like activities exceed a certain threshold, 100% of the principal will be 
repaid at maturity, and in any case, at least 50% of the principal will be 
repaid. Principal and interest payments will be made by the government of 
New South Wales (Impact Bond Global Database, 2019).
9.4.2.5  Pay-for-performance contracts
Pay-for-performance contracts are a special type of PPP that resembles SIBs. 
The main difference is that while SIBs are necessarily issued to achieve an 
environmental, social, or governance goal, pay-for-performance contracts 
do not necessarily have such a purpose. It is based on a private sector com-
pany, which is the investor, partnering with a public entity to implement an 
efficient and/or sustainable technology. The project does not provide any 

170  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
return to the investor (private sector company), during the development 
and construction phases, but when the project is completed and produces 
results, the return on the investment begins to be obtained. The savings 
to be made after the implementation are guaranteed by the investor, and 
the repayment of the investment is made from the savings that will occur. 
Pay-for-performance contracts are widely used in financing energy-related 
projects.
Evansville, Indiana entered a performance contract with Johnson Controls 
in 2017 to improve aging water and sewer infrastructure, reduce operating 
and maintenance costs, and provide better service. The project includes 
reducing energy use by 30% and solid waste by 20% in the wastewater 
treatment plant, energy production from restaurant and commercial kitchen 
fats, oils, and grease, and increasing the accuracy and efficiency of meter 
reading with an automated metering infrastructure. Under the contract, the 
city’s strategic and technical partner, Johnson Controls, invested $39 mil-
lion. Operational savings of $3.1 million per year are guaranteed and will be 
paid to Johnson Controls over 20 years (Johnson Controls, 2017).
9.4.2.6  User fees
User fees are money paid by individuals in exchange for benefiting from 
smart solutions provided in the city, and these fees can create a built-in 
reimbursement solution for smart city projects. The idea behind user fees is 
that people who want a superior and upgraded city experience make use of 
smart solutions offered by the city, and for this experience, they are ready 
to pay additional money (Galati, 2018). Therefore, unlike taxes, payment 
of user fees is not mandatory. With user fees, project costs can be assigned 
to the beneficiaries of the project, allowing all or part of the costs to be 
financed by users.
Services such as bike sharing and smart parking systems can be given as 
examples of smart city initiatives that can use this method. The main goal is 
to make these systems self-sustainable in the long run with the income from 
user fees.
9.4.2.7  Land-value capture
LVC is a financing method based on identifying the increased land value 
resulting from public investment in infrastructure and capitalizing on this 
increase in value. Local governments widely use value capture tools to 
encourage and/or invest in infrastructure improvement in suburbs where 
private investment risk will be high. For example, a city’s construction of 
new railway lines creates an increase in the value of the land and real estate 
in the vicinity of these lines. In line with the principle that those who ben-
efit from public infrastructure should pay for it, the owners of properties 
with increased value may be charged directly, or the amounts related to the 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  171
increase in value may be collected through an increase in land and property 
taxes. The revenue generated can again be directed to the project financing.
In a light rail project in Dublin, the city council requested a contribution 
of €55,000 from the owners of residential units within 1.5 kilometers of the 
rail line. Later, it appeared that proximity to the rail line added, on average, 
€155,000 to the value of each property in that area. This clearly demon-
strates that the government and property owners share the value increase 
generated by the rail line (Deloitte, 2019).
9.4.2.8 Tax-increment financing
TIF is a method based on debt financing in which borrowed funds are secured 
by future tax revenues. Successful use of this method depends on capturing 
the future value increases in land and real estate and the consequent increase 
in tax revenues as a result of the investments made. This approach therefore 
makes sense for extensive and large-scale projects such as sewer and water 
improvements, environmental remediation, and railway or road construc-
tion that will result in a sufficiently large increase in the value of land and 
real estate and therefore in tax revenues. The most common type of TIF is 
the issuance of TIF bonds, which are supported by a certain percentage of 
the estimated future tax revenues of local governments.
9.4.2.9 Venture philanthropy
The private sector plays a very important role as investor in financing smart 
projects, which it sees as attractive investment opportunities. However, pri-
vate sector, foundations, and non-profit organizations also help by providing 
financial support to smart projects and smart initiatives aimed at creating a 
better quality of life, a more equitable and more sustainable world, without 
expecting any monetary returns (Glasmeier and Christopherson, 2015).
The Smarter Cities Challenge is the biggest philanthropic initiative of 
IBM. Launched in 2010, this program has provided a total of $66 million 
till 2017 to 132 cities around the world each awarded with a grant of 
$500,000 to help them develop projects to move to smarter operations. In 
addition, winning cities received the support of a group of IBM experts for 
three weeks, with all costs covered by IBM (IBM, 2017). With its AI for 
Accessibility Grants, Microsoft supports projects that use AI to empower 
people living with disabilities (Microsoft, 2021). In 2017, the non-profit 
Knight Foundation awarded $1.2 million in grants to 6 cities to investigate 
the ways of implementing IoT responsibly and equitably (Knight Foundation, 
2017).

172  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
9.5 APPLICATION OF AI TOOLS IN FINANCING OF 
SMART CITIES
The term FinTech is the combination of the words “finance” and “technol-
ogy” and expresses the synergy between these two concepts. The Financial 
Stability Board (FSB) (2021) defines FinTech as “the use of technological 
tools to foster innovation of financial processes to create new business mod-
els, technology applications, processes and products that have a significant 
impact on financial markets, institutions and financial services”. Big data, 
blockchain, AI, and IoT have become the main technical support elements 
due to the deep integration of finance and technology, which has changed 
the rules of the game.
As mentioned earlier, smart and sustainable infrastructure projects tend 
to require high capital allocations, and their perceived technological risks 
are greater compared to traditional infrastructure projects. The motivation 
of investors is often to provide meaningful economic benefits from their 
investments. Therefore, innovative solutions are needed to make sustainable 
infrastructures financially feasible and appealing to investors. Advances in 
FinTech, particularly in AI and IoT technologies, affect the financing of 
smart cities by creating new financing instruments and reshaping the cost 
determination, performance measurement, risk pricing, and return calcula-
tion components of existing models. Having a much wider latitude of deci-
sion-making capability than traditional software, AI is used by many 
businesses to reduce operational expenses, increase efficiency, increase rev-
enue, and improve customer experience.
9.5.1 AI in pre-investment decision-making process
Potential investors have to make many decisions in the process of funding 
smart infrastructure projects. During this process, the use of AI-supported 
strategies enables more accurate decisions to be made. Many institutional 
investors use AI-supported tools such as DL, ML, and NLP to improve the 
quality of their investment decisions (Arslanian and Fischer, 2019).
By following patterns that cannot be detected by traditional research 
methods, AI can enable the discovery of promising opportunities. Analysis 
of unstructured data, such as the project team’s history, the total money col-
lected, through ML and NLP, can be used as an indicator of the future suc-
cess of the project. Parties seeking funding for infrastructure projects (usually 
municipalities) can identify investors most likely to invest using data such as 
potential investors’ past investment areas, financial structures, and key ele-
ments they consider. Utilizing NLP, ML, and algorithmic matching systems 
to harmonize the expectations of the parties with the opportunities that will 
meet these expectations enables more accurate decisions to be reached faster 
and at lower cost. This approach can also reveal meaningful insights that 
may not have been noticed before.

9.5.2  Managing regulations: RegTech
Sustainable smart city projects are under the lens of not only local investors, 
but investors all over the world. However, each country has its own rules 
and audit procedures in areas such as banking, finance, communication, and 
energy. Therefore, investors should act in accordance with the legal regula-
tions of the country in which they will invest. While the cost of complying 
with these regulations is high, the fines for non-compliance are even higher. 
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is a technology created to facilitate com-
pliance with complex regulations and to serve users in process monitoring. 
As a result of the instant information and data flow they provide and the 
evaluation of this information, RegTechs focus on identifying the points that 
do not comply with the regulations and harmonizing these points. Based on 
the instant information and data flow they provide and the evaluation of 
this information and data, RegTech focuses on identifying and harmonizing 
points that do not comply with the regulations. RegTech companies use ML 
and NLP to automate and smooth the compliance process and produce real-
time solutions. Such automated solutions create huge reductions in the cost 
of tracking changes in regulations created in different languages in different 
countries, and thus the cost of investment financing.
9.5.3  Financial benefits of using acquired data: data 
monetizing
Smart cities include elements such as smart homes and offices, smart light-
ing, smart traffic control systems, smart water supply, and smart transporta-
tion. These smart systems are equipped with RFID and sensor technologies 
that provide a huge amount of continuous data flow. While traditional real 
assets have specific purposes of use and specific benefits, the limits of the 
benefits provided by smart real assets are much wider depending on the 
data they produce. For example, streetlights’ traditional purpose is light-
ing and increasing safety. In addition to these purposes, a smart lighting 
system functions as a wireless hub for internet service providers and as a 
hotspot for first responders in emergencies. Due to these benefits it provides, 
it has the potential to increase the desire for work and live, and accordingly 
the real estate values in the vicinity. As can be seen, smart infrastructure is 
much more than traditional physical infrastructure. Links between systems 
enable smart infrastructures to function laterally including multiple sectors 
and to be adapted for different usage purposes (Hamilton and Zhu, 2017). 
Therefore, it can be said that each smart infrastructure asset has an estab-
lished value chain with spillover effects spreading through the other sectors 
of the economic network (Adriaens and Ajami, 2021; Eckenrode, 2015).
AI-driven systems in smart infrastructures result in hyper-accurate urban 
data that enables immediate response to problems and sustainable use of 
resources (Yigitcanlar et al., 2020). Today, the value of the information 

174  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
collected by the sensors of smart infrastructure assets has become as impor-
tant as the performance of the tangible asset. In new investment and financ-
ing models, data on the performance of assets and how they are used can 
have significant commercial value as a critical input element (Adriaens et al., 
2021). The financial value of data depends on its commodification. In other 
words, for those who invest in smart infrastructures, obtaining meaningful 
data that can be converted into money from these assets can be an impor-
tant incentive (Adriaens and Ajami, 2021). These inputs, which require the 
use of IoT and AI, are also called “derivative effects” of the knowledge econ-
omy (Eckenrode, 2015).
“Data monetizing”, as an IoT and AI-based financing method, is based on 
providing support for the financing of investments with the income obtained 
from the sale of data produced by the sensors. For example, traffic informa-
tion is valuable for advertisers who want to know where to put their bill-
boards in the city to get the most effective results. One day, the same 
information may be necessary for a company that invests in charging sta-
tions for electric vehicles (Deloitte, 2019). Each sensor-powered light pole 
not only provides energy-efficient street lighting but also generates a huge 
amount of data on social life and environmental conditions. The city can 
turn this into an opportunity and monetize this data by charging an access 
fee from third parties who want to use and benefit from it, such as a com-
pany that wants to create a parking application. While revenue stream of 
traditional street lighting systems is realized only with energy cost savings, 
the revenue flow of smart street lighting systems is increased by a multiplier 
factor due to the economic value of the data (Hamilton and Zhu, 2017). An 
important issue here is the need to balance the commercial use of data with 
the rules regarding the protection of personal information.
9.5.4  Utilizing data to determine financial and non-
financial returns
Leveraging AI to assess risk and offer investment recommendations may 
pave the way for more people to invest in instruments used in smart city 
financing with high return potential. ML is used to detect complex invest-
ment patterns in real time in a wide variety of markets. For example, 
Kavout, founded by former Google employees, creates investment solutions 
by assimilating large amounts of complex data through AI and ML to find 
alpha with adaptive learning algorithms and to uncover hidden, dynamic, 
and non-linear patterns in the financial world. By using AI technology, the 
company makes suggestions for the most profitable stocks on a daily basis 
through pattern detection and price estimation methods. It also uses AI algo-
rithms to create portfolios (Kavout, 2021). Aberdeen Global has issued an 
Artificial Intelligence Global Equity Sicav in Luxembourg, created in collab-
oration between the Quantitative Investment Strategies team of Aberdeen 
Standard Investments, the Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Investment Technology 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  175
Institute, and the Trust Bank in Tokyo. This publicly traded open-end invest-
ment fund uses various AI techniques, particularly ML, to time and weight 
their investments to provide investors with a high risk-adjusted permanent 
return (International Investment, 2018).
Data provided by smart infrastructures can also be used in the pricing and 
valuation of stocks and bonds in capital markets. DC Water, in partnership 
with Goldman Sachs and Calvert Impact Capital, issued a green bond in 
2016 to finance an infrastructure project in Washington, D. C., aimed at 
controlling stormwater runoff and improving the area’s water quality. Bond 
payments to investors are tied to the performance of the infrastructure. In 
the case of a decrease of more than 41.3% in stormwater flow, DC Water 
makes an outcome payment of $3,300,319.00 to investors, and in case of a 
decrease of less than 18.6%, investors are obliged to pay DC Water a risk 
share of $3,300,319.00 (Goldman Sachs, 2016). In such variable interest 
rate bonds, asset performance is linked to the bond payment through the 
integration of IoT.
The presence of large amounts of real-time data can also enable the analy-
sis of investor behavior, potentially creating new pools of capital with new 
and different reward systems (Eckenrode, 2015). For example, Clarity AI is 
an organization that aims to help investors allocate their funds taking into 
account social and environmental impact factors. It uses big data and ML to 
show its customers how the investments they have made and/or they will 
make affect the world (Clarity AI, 2021).
9.5.5  Impact of AI on crowdfunding
Crowdfunding, which is explained within the scope of innovative financing 
methods, is a tool that requires access to many people with a digital connec-
tion infrastructure. More and more online crowdfunding platforms are rely-
ing on AI technologies to launch campaigns, predict investor and/or donor 
behavior, display targeted ads, create content, detect campaign fraudsters, 
and authenticate campaigners.
AI tools can process large amounts of user data to predict donor and/or 
investor preferences. Data on past donations and/or investments and demo-
graphic characteristics of potential donors and/or investors can pave the 
way for customized crowdfunding opportunities (Arslanian and Fischer, 
2019). This data also helps crowdfunding platforms identify content that 
appeals most to their user base. AI-driven chatbots allow crowdfunding 
campaigns to be launched in a much shorter time than applications made by 
filling out long forms. ImpactGuru is an Indian donation-based crowdfund-
ing platform that uses AI-based storytelling tools. Based on the campaign 
information that is being launched, the story builder impressively reveals the 
reason for raising money, which is aimed at attracting more donors 
(ImpactGuru, 2021).

176  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
The use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can make funding 
processes safer and more transparent. For example, GiveTrack is a dona-
tion-based crowdfunding platform that uses Bitcoin and Blockchain tech-
nology. The platform provides transparency and accountability to donors 
by directing them to the latest status of funds and project results in real time. 
In addition, the use of blockchain ensures the precise tracking of donor 
funds from start to finish, eliminates the misuse of funds, and improves the 
efficiency of processes by reducing costs and shortening transaction times 
(GiveTrack, 2021).
9.5.6  Merging blockchain, AI, and IoT: tokenization
Smart city infrastructure projects are often financed by fixed income instru-
ments consisting of municipal and private (corporate) bonds and loans. 
Although innovative models such as crowdfunding require the public to 
fund projects, the money collected often does not reach big amounts, so 
investments in smart city projects are largely narrowed to a limited group 
of institutional investors, and a considerable amount of capital is left idle.
New technologies lead to rethinking and redesigning the way services are 
delivered. Blockchain technology, which paves the way for the digitization 
of the most basic commercial interactions, has the potential to create major 
changes in financial processes. One of the tools that best represents the 
potential for change is “tokens”.
Asset tokenization is the process of creating digital tokens representing 
tangible or intangible assets on the blockchain, that is, digitizing assets. 
Since the early days of Bitcoin, efforts have been made to utilize Bitcoins as 
“tokens” to represent assets (Smith et al., 2019). Every blockchain token 
represents the ownership of a certain share of an asset. Through tokeniza-
tion, the information about that asset, the value of the asset, and the legal 
rights associated with the asset are transferred to the blockchain. “Tokenized 
securities” are the blockchain-embedded representations of real-world secu-
rities. Just like holders of traditional securities, owners of tokens, as share-
holders, can take part in the decision-making process by exercising their 
voting rights. Again, similar to traditional securities, tokens can be traded in 
secondary markets.
Tokenization is generally regarded as appropriate for infrastructure assets, 
which are well-established throughout the entire project lifecycle, play 
important roles in supporting economies, and can generate long-term stable 
cash flows (Tian et al., 2020). In this respect, tokenized securities can be 
used effectively to implement alternative financing models in smart city 
infrastructure projects.
Liquid Token is a tokenization platform that offers investment opportuni-
ties for tokenized sustainable development and impact projects and prom-
ises annual returns of 7–12%. While this platform serves projects such as 
renewable energy, recycling, sustainable products, social infrastructure, and 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  177
efficient transport, it excludes projects such as tobacco, gambling, intensive 
agriculture, and military (Liquid Token, 2021).
ZiyenCoin is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-compliant 
blockchain token issued by Ziyen Inc. for energy and oil assets. The com-
pany’s board of directors stated their purpose as “contributing to the cre-
ation of a new blockchain-based energy trading ecosystem” (Ziyen, 2019). 
Although this is a pilot project with limited contribution to the global infra-
structure market, its success will further highlight the potential of tokens to 
address the financing problems of global infrastructure investments (Tian 
et al., 2020).
Tokenization increases liquidity, transparency, and efficiency, while reduc-
ing transaction costs and thus facilitating access to alternative sources of 
capital in financing smart cities. With tokenization, smart infrastructure 
projects that require large amounts of investment can be divided into small 
volumes, allowing the involvement of small and medium-sized institutional 
investors, and even individual ones. Moreover, while traditional methods 
usually provide financing from domestic investors, tokenization provides 
access to a global investor base. Tokenization has the potential to greatly 
increase transaction volumes by enabling the conversion of illiquid infra-
structure assets into liquid assets (Uzsoki, 2019; Tian et al., 2020). By trad-
ing tokens in real time on global markets, it can also narrow bid-ask spreads, 
increase market depth, and create additional liquidity for infrastructure 
assets (Tian et al., 2020). Another advantage of tokenization is lower trans-
action costs, such as those associated with public listings and secondary 
market transactions (Uzsoki, 2019).
As blockchain is based on smart contracts, the management and execu-
tion of blockchain tokens are therefore carried out by smart contracts. The 
terms and conditions stated in smart contracts are accessible and apparent, 
which bring transparency, precision, and confidence to the transactions. 
Being self-executing contracts, which refer to the automation of the execu-
tion process, smart contracts allow fast, secure, and efficient transactions. 
With the use of IoT that automates data collection, tokens with target values 
or performance criteria defined in the contract terms can be transferred to 
investors’ portfolios without human intervention and recorded on the 
blockchain when contract terms are met (Tian et al., 2020; Schletz et al., 
2020). Through smart contracts, transactions can be monitored and vali-
dated with a minimum inclusion of external third parties such as financial 
or regulatory intermediaries, which also reduces the transaction costs related 
to these processes (Buterin, 2013). Therefore, transactions can be carried 
out more efficiently and at a lower cost in a shorter time.
Intelligent infrastructure systems contain sensors that generate highly 
detailed, location-specific data along with information about the perfor-
mance and operations of the asset. Data on performance helps the evalua-
tion of systems based on how efficiently they are used, the risks of downtime 
due to deterioration, and their contribution to economic value creation. 

178  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
These values of the assets can be translated into pricing models and included 
in a token that can be traded on a blockchain.
In addition to all these advantages, tokenization also has some weak-
nesses. These are the lack of knowledge and awareness and, consequently, 
the uncertainty in legal regulations. In particular, the lack of legal regula-
tions is the biggest obstacle to the widespread use of tokenization. It is 
important to maintain a balance when making regulations regarding this 
new technology. Too extreme and harsh rules to be put in place at this 
early stage may reduce the willingness and enthusiasm of people to adopt 
this new financial instrument, while the absence of rules or the existence 
of too flexible rules may lead to the exploitation of honest actors by 
fraudulent actors (Schletz et al., 2020). In this context, it is necessary to 
establish appropriate, sufficient, and consistent legal regulations in all 
countries.
9.6  CONCLUSION
A smart city can be defined as a city that utilizes information and com-
munication technologies to enhance the quality of life of its residents while 
ensuring sustainable development. Sustainable smart cities are based on the 
most modern technologies, and these technological solutions require access 
to financial resources due to their high investment costs. Achieving high liv-
ing standards through high-tech investments, covering the operating costs 
of these investments, and ultimately achieving sustainable development 
goals are all heavily reliant on cities’ financial capacities. Almost no city has 
the financial capacity to handle such a financial burden alone. Overcoming 
the lack of financial capacity requires the provision of funds from various 
sources by using efficient financing models.
According to the traditional view of financing infrastructure investments 
that provide public benefits, relevant expenditures should be covered by 
central or local government bodies. This perspective brings with it tradi-
tional financing methods. These consist of governmental (or federal) and/or 
municipal grants and subsidies, municipal bonds, and IRBs. Banks are 
another traditional source of funds with the loans and leases they grant. The 
amounts of these funds are strongly correlated with the level of economic 
development of countries, which naturally facilitates the creation of smart 
cities in countries with developed financial markets. In this case, financially 
underdeveloped and developing countries are at a disadvantage in creating 
smart cities as they do not have sufficient access to funds from traditional 
sources. Moreover, even in developed countries, funds obtained through tra-
ditional methods may be insufficient. Multinational bodies such as the 
World Bank, the EU, the UN, the IMF, and the ADB provide financial sup-
port to promising smart projects. However, obtaining funds from these 
highly selective institutions involves long procedural processes. The 

Sustainable financing of smart cities  179
inadequacy of traditional methods in providing funds has led to the emer-
gence of innovative models. Prominent innovative financial models are PPPs, 
crowdfunding, green bonds, SIBs, pay-for-performance contracts, user fees, 
LVC, TIF, and venture philanthropy. With these innovative funding mecha-
nisms, financing channels are expanded and diversified.
Advances in AI technologies reshape the cost determination, performance 
measurement, risk pricing, and return calculation components of existing 
methods, while also ensuring the formation of new instruments in the 
financing of smart cities. In the pre-investment decision-making process, AI 
can improve the quality of investment decisions by monitoring patterns that 
cannot be detected by traditional research methods and by enabling the 
discovery of promising opportunities. In addition, AI-supported RegTech 
solutions significantly reduce the cost of complying with the rules and regu-
lations created in different languages in different countries and, accordingly, 
the cost of investment financing. Leveraging AI to conduct risk assessments 
and provide investment recommendations can pave the way for more people 
to opt for potentially high-return financing tools used in smart city finance. 
The large amounts of real-time data provided by smart infrastructures can 
also enable the analysis of investor behavior and the creation of new capital 
pools with new and different reward systems. Today, the value of the infor-
mation collected by the sensors of smart infrastructure assets has become as 
important as the performance of tangible asset. Data monetizing, an IoT 
and AI-based financing method, involves the sale of this data to third par-
ties, and the income obtained supports the financing of the investment. 
Crowdfunding is a method of financing a project based on public funding 
through online platforms. Online crowdfunding platforms can receive sup-
port from AI technologies in the processes of launching campaigns, predict-
ing donor behavior, displaying targeted ads, creating content, and verifying 
the identities of the campaigners. In addition, the use of blockchain technol-
ogy and cryptocurrencies on these platforms can make funding processes 
safer and more transparent. A striking case of the use of AI in finance is asset 
tokenization, that is, the process of digitizing assets on the blockchain. 
Tokenized securities, which are blockchain-embedded representations of 
real-world securities, can be effectively used to finance smart city infrastruc-
ture projects.
Smart cities are places that foster innovation, where people and organiza-
tions living in are not only the end users but also the creators of services and 
solutions. This social change paved the way for new and sustainable rela-
tionships between the city and its citizens and between the city and organi-
zations, resulting in the development of new and collaborative financial 
solutions. The financial size of smart city investments is not an insurmount-
able challenge, but it requires entrepreneurial approaches that emerge from 
the combination of the financial resources and creativity of the private sec-
tor and the commitment of the public sector.

10.1  INTRODUCTION
Urban systems have a complex and multi-layered structure. Urban issues 
vary under the influence of globalization and the growth process. These 
issues are exemplified as the extensive population movements, chaos, crime, 
traffic, waste, energy, water and air pollution, urban sprawl, etc. It is observed 
that traditional methods for solving the problems of urban systems do not 

186  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
respond (Orselli, and Akbay, 2019). Due to the increase in the number of 
disasters associated with rapid urbanization processes and global climate 
change, there has been a significant increase in the problems experienced 
in principal services (environment, health, education, infrastructure, secu-
rity, etc.) in urban areas. Moreover, many negative developments are driving 
today’s cities into a complicated, multi-variable, complex living environment 
to solve such as rural-to-urban exodus, the rebalancing of socio-economic 
levels among regions, the rapid consumption of natural resources and the 
observation of environmental destruction, urban development dynamics, 
etc. (Durduran and Geymen, 2008; Lin et al., 2015).
Accordingly, urban settlements have become almost a network of multi-
turned-community living and new technological innovations have become 
almost an obligation in accordance to raise the level of welfare, population, 
resource, environment, and information processing technologies (Orselli, 
and Akbay, 2019). Local authorities have increased significantly recently to 
improve the quality of life and satisfaction of citizens with public services by 
integrating information and communication technologies (ICTs) into all 
areas of life (Harrison and Donnelly, 2011). It is also an important proof 
that there has been a change in the axis of methods applied to urban 
systems.
It is clear that the number and frequency of disasters are increasing day by 
day and because of dense population and urbanization practices worldwide. 
Also, different types of disasters are being experienced in different regions 
due to global climate change. As a result of showing a multiplier effect on 
the disaster risk of urban areas, effective disaster management is needed 
urgently. There exists a widely accepted approach that the use of ICTs is 
necessary for DRM. This approach is crucial to manage the integrated mod-
ern disaster management process efficiently in a sustainable, long-term, 
effective, multi-stakeholder, and interdisciplinary manner (Abhijeet and 
Samir, 2015; More, 2019; Corrado, 2021).
Disasters caused significant losses worldwide and are continuing from the 
past periods until today. Due to many disasters occurring within a short 
time, certain steps are critical for a successful and effective disaster manage-
ment process such as the rapid planning, decision-making, implementation 
of the right practices, etc. Overall, the disaster management process has a 
complex and dynamic structure. Significant facilities are required to control 
this structure like to store, process, map, and evaluate volume data coming 
from systems via technology. Innovative technologies will provide signifi-
cant benefits in terms of risk mitigation before disaster as well as disaster 
(Çağlayan et al., 2018; More, 2019; Kemper and Kemper, 2020; Tan et al., 
2021).
Space technology-based systems should be used for the purpose of collect-
ing, compiling, storing, updating, organizing, analyzing, managing, and pre-
senting data, especially by ensuring their full integration in decision-making 
processes in today’s rapidly changing conditions. Other infrastructure

elements that will meet this need can be listed as the establishment of a 
national disaster coordination and data center, establishment of a techno-
logical infrastructure for the disaster data bank, making legal arrangements, 
providing the necessary skilled human resources, and also providing the 
budget for sustainability needs (Durduran and Geymen, 2008; Inter-
American Development Bank, 2010; Maskrey, 2011). The disaster risk 
assessment is a fundamental part of DRM. It can be said that it is a pillar for 
an informed decision-making process. The efforts on DRM can be challeng-
ing to evaluate due to they remain invisible until a disaster event occurs. The 
attempt to measure risk management is a significant challenge from the con-
ceptual, scientific, technical, and numerical perspectives when faced with 
natural phenomena. Indicators of these processes must be transparent, 
robust, representative, and easily understood by public policymakers at 
national, subnational, and urban levels (Carreno et al., 2007; Lantada et al., 
2020).
The field of risk management requires a smart city management applica-
tion with a very broad perspective. Therefore, it is necessary to consider risk 
management with a portfolio approach to include all possible risks. In this 
section, the stage reached in risk management is presented based on the AI 
literature. At the same time, future expectations are revealed in risk manage-
ment based on modernist technological tools available for best practices in 
DRM practices such as Internet of Things (IoT), Remote Sensing (RS), 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Radio Frequency Identification 
Systems (RFID), Image Identification, decision support systems (DSSs), 
Social Media, Smart City, Cloud Computing, and Big Data. Thus, informa-
tion provided in this section will assist managers who take part in the rele-
vant processes in the healthy and effective execution of risk management 
activities of the smart city structuring under the AI framework to adapt 
sustainable urban systems in the disaster risk reduction (DRR) process.
10.2  LITERATURE REVIEW OF DRM FROM THE 
PERSPECTIVE OF AI
The International Disasters Database (EM-DAT) reports that an emer-
gency has to meet certain criteria to be deemed a disaster. Accordingly, it is 
expected that 10 or more people have been killed, 100 or more have been 
affected or the states have issued an emergency notice or called for interna-
tional aid. At least one of these criteria must have been fulfilled. Natural and 
human disasters in different locations caused 20,533 disasters in the world 
which caused 4.5 million deaths during the years 1965–2020. About 62% 
of these disasters are natural disasters and 38% are humanitarian catastro-
phes (EM-DAT, 2016; Çağlayan et al., 2018).
Disasters caused significant losses worldwide and are continuing from the 
past periods until today. Due to many disasters occurring within a short

time, certain steps are critical for a successful and effective disaster manage-
ment process such as the rapid planning, decision-making, implementation 
of the right practices, etc. Overall, the disaster management process has a 
complex and dynamic structure. Significant facilities are required to control 
this structure like to store, process, map and evaluate volume data coming 
from systems via technology. Innovative technologies will provide signifi-
cant benefits in terms of risk mitigation before disaster as well as disaster 
(Çağlayan et al., 2018; More, 2019; Kemper and Kemper, 2020; Tan et al., 
2021).
It is clear that the number and frequency of disasters are increasing day by 
day and because of dense population and urbanization practices worldwide. 
Also, different types of disasters are being experienced in different regions 
due to global climate change. As a result of showing a multiplier effect on 
the disaster risk of urban areas, effective disaster management is needed 
urgently. There exists a widely accepted approach that the use of ICTs is 
necessary for DRM. This approach is crucial to manage the integrated mod-
ern disaster management process efficiently in a sustainable, long-term, 
effective, multi-stakeholder and interdisciplinary manner (Abhijeet and 
Samir, 2015; More, 2019; Corrado, 2021).
The advantages of ICT are utilized in all phases including the prediction 
of potential risks in the event of disasters, the implementation of risk analy-
sis processes, the preparation of action plans for preparation and mitigation, 
and also the implementation of policies. Any technology-based applications 
have become the principal reference for resolving complex problems such as 
urban systems and minimizing disaster risk (Sürmeli, 2011; Çağlayan et al., 
2018; Sun et al., 2020: Yiğitcanlar et al., 2020). From this viewpoint, this 
section will give detailed information on AI, which is the common name for 
technological applications in the field of Risk Management. This field refer-
ences the pre-disaster period and focuses on disaster mitigation risks that 
cause loss of life and property in urban areas. Besides, this chapter will cover 
topics such as the concept of AI, the working principles of AI applications, 
the place of risk management in AI applications, advantages and disadvan-
tages of the use of AI in disaster mitigation processes and application 
examples.
10.2.1  Mainstreaming DRM and AI
It is clear that the organizational structure and operational capacity are 
becoming increasingly important both at central and local levels in an effec-
tive disaster management process. While satellite systems, television, radio, 
radio, and SMS applications used to be effective tools in disaster manage-
ment, new and modernist technologies have come into play today such as 
IoT, AI, robots, and smart systems. The utilization of technological capabili-
ties to establish communication between shareholders and to increase the 
capacity for data procurement has been highly preferred during the disaster

management process. The COVID-19 pandemic process is one of the most 
successful examples of this determination regarding crisis management 
(More, 2019; Memiş and Babaoğlu, 2020b). The application areas of infor-
mation technologies in disaster management are presented in Figure 10.1.
Among many opportunities of using new technological tools, the determi-
nation of disaster risks at the pre-disaster stage and also the management of 
effective mitigation planning processes are underlying ones. GIS, Social 
Networking Services, and ICTs can be given as examples for the implemen-
tation of these issues addressed under Integrated Disaster Management 
(Corrado, 2021; Tan et al., 2021). The application areas using these techno-
logical tools before and after a disaster are presented in Table 10.1.
AI is a common name of a method that tries to model human thinking 
ability and the functions of the human brain. Moreover, AI attempts to 
mimic human intelligence by means of a computer and is able to provide 
solutions by utilizing necessary information in crisis situations. In the 1940s, 
the first AI concept was developed and also it reached a crucial point by 
building human-shaped robots by the 1990s. The use and accessibility of 
databases are an advantageous technique when it is not always easy to

access the data. Besides, this technique acts as a locomotor in raising differ-
ent specialists and developing new soft wares. From this perspective, it can 
be said that AI is an important tool to offer an effective DRM process 
against increasing disaster risks and assists in the solution of complex urban 
systems (Sürmeli, 2011; Kemper and Kemper, 2020).
The usage of AI has three main functions related to urban resilience: (a) 
Making predictions regarding various disasters, (b) performing impact 
assessments on disasters, and (c) increasing social resilience against disas-
ters. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), 
Convolutional Neural Network, Relation Network, and Machine Learning 
(ML) are commonly used in line with these functions among the AI tools. 
While the applications areas are examined that these tools correspond to in

the implementation, these exist ANN which stands out through social media 
use, RNN which is used for pre- and post-disaster comparison by monitor-
ing changes, GIS and ICTs for predicting the effects of disasters (World 
Bank, 2018; Sun et al., 2020).
It is clear that the method differs according to the types of disasters and 
the analysis to be performed when the examples of application areas for the 
use of AI in DRM are examined. For example, the ML method is used to 
collect and classify data on disaster events occurring from the past to nowa-
days and also to carry out modeling studies in order to make future predic-
tions. This method is one of the most frequently used methods within the 
scope of AI. In addition, other methods such as Random Forest, Lazy, J48 
Tree, ANN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression are also used to perform 
modeling studies (World Bank, 2018). It is possible to carry out different 
thematic analyses according to the disaster type using these methods by 
determining the dependent and independent variables. The flow chart for 
the use of AI applications and the methods used in the DRM process are 
presented in Figure 10.2.
Many technological tools are taken advantage of an opportunity in risk 
mitigation studies to ensure successful management of natural and anthro-
pogenic disasters which are raised from topographic, meteorological, natu-
ral, and structured environmental conditions in different regions such as the 
IoT, GIS, RS, sensors, and RFID. The use of these tools can be listed as 
(Çağlayan et al., 2018):
	•	 IoT and RS: Studies for the determination of disaster scenarios due to 
differences of urban settlements, the micro-zoning based on risk and 
hazard maps, the determination of structural risk status, and the cost 
estimation regarding potential disasters.
	•	 RFID, Image Identification, DSSs, and Social Media: Studies for the 
preparation of emergency plans, the determination of temporary 
shelter areas, the resolving various problems (transportation, health, 
housing, technical equipment, etc.), and the coordination among 
stakeholders.
	•	 GIS: Studies for the damage assessment facilities, the determination 
of evacuation corridors, the accurate guidance of emergency teams on 
site, and the management of DSSs.
Therefore, it is also known that Big Data and data analytics methods are 
used especially in the state of emergency. The data are supplied in three dif-
ferent ways in these cases (Tan et al., 2021):
Direct data: The user-based data collected from a specific region
Automated data: The data acquired passively through the system
Voluntary data: The data shared on social media by active people

192  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
In the process of risk determination and estimation of potential disaster 
damages, a common problem occurs. This problem is including only physi-
cal factors and also eliminating social factors in DRM processes. The effi-
ciency of disaster-based studies is adversely affected because of this reason. 
ANN is preferred to solve this problem by using various parameters in risk 
analysis studies such as population, employment, social and economic struc-
ture, and migration (Çağlayan et al., 2018; Memiş and Babaoğlu, 2020a). 
AI has a critical role not only in risk and damage assessment phases but also 
in the use of spatial and non-spatial information in pre-disaster studies to 
minimize disaster risks.
Even though the awareness related to the need for usage of ICT has 
increased in the face of disasters that have frequently occurred around the 
world in recent years, it is still observed that ICT and AI applications are not 
utilized at the expected level. While the average utilization of ICT and AI is

around 7%, the use of disaster-based applications on the website is esti-
mated to be 20% and 7% on smartphones worldwide. When each country 
is examined specifically, the average utilization of technology to minimize 
various disaster risks is around 14-15% in the US and China, whereas the 
average is around 3-5% in many countries (Australia, Greece, Taiwan, 
England, Germany, Italy, Japan) (Nunavath and Goodwin, 2018; Sun et al., 
2020).
10.2.2 The use of AI in DRM process: pros and cons
The usage of computer vision and AI through geospatial information and 
geoanalytics can be interpreted as “the world is shifting towards the second 
revolution and transformative technology” (Rajabifard et al., 2020). Besides 
these, various modernist technological tools are utilized for the success of 
the sustainable development goals are the scene of a great change such as 
IoT, block chain technology, cloud-based platforms, various open sources, 
unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. Computer vision and AI tools are necessary 
not only for organizing Big Data from different sources but also for building 
smarter cities in coordination of human, intelligence, and integrated tech-
nologies (Pirasteh and Varshosaz, 2019).
From this point of view, the advantages and disadvantages of using AI are 
discussed in the DRM process according to the knowledge emphasized in 
the academic literature and the knowledge experienced in the application 
areas. The advantages of utilizing AI in DRM practices can be listed as fol-
lows (Sun et al., 2020):
	•	 The development of a comprehensive and systematic approach to min-
imize the potential losses of disaster
	•	 The utilization from technological tools to minimize the possible losses 
of disasters
	•	 The development of policies and strategies in DRM by the local and 
central administrations via ICT
	•	 The learning more about human behavior during a disaster
	•	 The utilization from technological facilities for search, rescue opera-
tions, and wreck operations after a disaster (drone, unmanned aerial 
vehicles, etc.)
	•	 The bringing new perspectives to urbanization processes by the effects 
of ICT
	•	 The contribution to sustainable urban development and facilitating 
public services
	•	 The determination of the current potentials and limits of urban 
settlements
	•	 The accessibility to real-time and instant information on transporta-
tion networks before and after disasters using the Big Data method
	•	 The resource assignment can be made before and after the disaster

194  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	•	 The recommendation for benefit-enabling cost analysis
	•	 The disaster scenarios’ building and possible damage assessments
The disadvantages of utilizing AI in DRM practices can be listed as follows 
(Pirasteh and Varshosaz, 2019; Corrado, 2021):
	•	 The insufficiency of technological capabilities in providing urban 
resilience
	•	 The different speed of advance in policy development and technologi-

	•	 The lack of local solution to globally observed environmental issues
	•	 The lack of legal legislation on spatial data and environmental policies
	•	 The incomplete explanation of neural network behavior and function-
ing in AI applications

As is known, emergency management is a management process that begins 
before emergencies and involves the efforts to bring people’s lives back 
to normal. This type of management involves natural disasters, terrorist 
attacks, and events that affect many people materially and morally on a 
large scale. The process is dynamic and a well-functioning system to plan 
for various situations in many different disaster scenarios in the emergency 
management.
When the advantages and disadvantages of using AI tools are listed, a few 
points stand out, although technological advances and the reduction of 
disaster risks are among the main subjects of AI expertise. The first of these 
is the difference between the progress made by DRM processes and the 
progress made by AI from the past to present. This also can lead to systemic 
disruptions. It is also a significant gain that AI applications have been incor-
porated actively and effectively into the efforts to reduce disaster risk in a 
short period of 30 years which gained momentum in the 1990s. As a com-
mon feature of urbanization practices and technological applications, it is 
crucial to closely monitor and manage multi-variable processes in order to 
have many uncertainties regarding the operation of the process and to estab-
lish a sustainable structure. Accordingly, the advantages and disadvantages 
of AI in DRM practices should be carefully and comparatively monitored.
10.2.3  Implementation of AI in DRM practice
In the literature, reviewed studies show that the use of AI tools in all fields is 
becoming widespread in parallel with the development of computer technol-
ogies and hardware today. Examples of this evaluation are systems analysis,

medicine, the defense industry, communication, production, automation, 
disaster management, economics, and DSSs (Sürmeli, 2011; World Bank, 
2018). Several systems are used in DRM practices to manage the disaster 
risks effectively (Çağlayan et al., 2018).
Studies in the literature show that the use of AI applications in all fields is 
becoming widespread in parallel with the development of computer tech-
nologies and hardware today. Examples of this are systems analysis, medi-
cine, the defense industry, communication, production, automation, disaster 
management, economics, and DSSs (Sürmeli, 2011; World Bank, 2018). 
Several systems (IoT, RS, GIS, Radio Frequency Identification, sensors, and 
so on) are used in the risk management process for the correct and effective 
management of disaster risks (Çağlayan et al., 2018). The demonstration of 
how and to what extent technological capabilities are utilized in different 
applications within the scope of this study. In addition, Table 10.2 shows the 
activities related to the DRM phases and provides related DRM practices.
Peña-Mora et al. (2008) have considered and discussed the building situ-
ation assessments in the response and recovery phases in DRM. A proposal 
for an information system has been developed which meets the needs of 
“collaboration for preparedness, response and recovery (CP2R) system” 
and supports the building assessment efforts (Peña-Mora et al., 2008). 
Alamdar et al. (2016) have studied how sensors and their data can support 
different organizations in DRM. The study is based on an example for flood 
damage in Austria. They have proposed a new approach based on the sensor 
web type in the study that divides the challenges into three faced in DRM 
practices (Alamdar et al., 2016).
Gill et al. (2016) have recommended an IoT-enabled system approach 
that is a guided information system and can inform older people in emergen-
cies. The aim of the study is to introduce this system approach to the elderly 
in Austria where frequent emergency cases occur. Different architectural 
structures are proposed in the study and also a prototype study is performed 
with an example (Gill et al., 2016). Ray and Turuk (2017) have investigated 
the availability of IoT in disaster management in their studies. Disaster types 
have been evaluated in terms of management, monitoring, analysis, and 
forecasting. In the study, they have examined many types of disasters and 
made comparisons by giving examples of existing applications which pro-
vided extensive information about IoT-supported protocols in DRM (Ray 
and Turuk, 2017).
Ray and Turuk (2017) have developed a proposal for post-disaster com-
munication in their works which emphasized the importance of time in case 
of a disaster. The challenges have been explained that the network may face 
in the event of a disaster and the proposed system is compared against the 
existing ones (Ray and Turuk, 2017). Lv et al. (2017) have proposed an 
electronic government cloud service model in their study. They have 
improved a DSS for disaster management in considering an all-stage. The 
proposed system has been examined in different layers as technological

structures and applications, and a detailed description of each layer is given 
(Lv et al., 2017).
Landwehr et al. (2016) and Ai et al. (2016) have considered the mitiga-
tion processes for the tsunami situation in their studies which proposed 
the DSS. The study has been concentrated on GIS and social media 
(Landwehr et al., 2016; Ai et al., 2016). Chung and Park (2016) have pro-
posed an IoT-based “Peer-to-Peer” cloud system that could quickly and 
securely obtain and store data in disaster situations (Chung and Park, 
2016). Deak et al. (2013), Yang et al. (2013), and Wang et al. (2015) have 
taken the intervention stage into consideration. Decision support and 
communication network systems are proposed by utilizing IoT, sensor, and 
GIS systems in these studies (Deak et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Wang 
et al., 2015).
Yao et al. (2017) have aimed to determine different algorithms in the 
study of how cities are distributed across buildings. The main objective of 
the study is to determine population distributions and optimize resource 
assignment activities. Social media data can be used for early warning dur-
ing work before, during, and after disasters in terms of informing people 
about the magnitude of disasters, the needs of disaster victims, and also 
security of disaster victims after disasters. The obtained data has been ana-
lyzed through data analytics (Linardi, 2016; Ai et al., 2016; Neppalli et al., 
2017; Papadopuluos et al., 2017). Landwehr et al. (2016) have studied plan-
ning and early warning for the tsunami using tweet analysis of text messages 
being sent. They have sorted the key words out of these messages by captur-
ing them and implementing statistics and ML methods after sorting 
(Landwehr et al., 2016).
Ma and Zhang (2017) have proposed a DSS for collaboration, coordina-
tion, and communications using Big Data method (Ma and Zhang, 2017). 
Yeum et al. (2018) have worked on how to process and classify images from 
post-disaster research using historical disaster images in their study. In this 
study, they have implemented an ANN method in the image classification 
and damage determination (Yeum et al., 2018). Ř ezník et al. (2017) have 
done a study on how data from three different information systems can be 
used in agricultural areas for emergencies. They have evaluated the use of 
data acquired during preparation and intervention phases (Ř ezník et al., 
2017). Tak and Soo (2017) have proposed a real-time system that enables 
assessing information from different sensors and also the integration of GIS 
into this system. The risk assessment activities are focused on considering 
the preparation phase of DRM (Tak and Soo, 2017).
Griffth et al. (2017) have provided recommendations for humanitarian 
logistics in their study. The system recommends mapping and decision trees 
that take into account the desired locations on the Internet, as well as reduc-
ing decision cycles. The study also specifies resources for which data can be 
acquired (Griffith et al., 2017). Lele and Lihua (2016) have proposed a pre-
ventive system for preventive emergencies in the chemistry industry to 

198  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
monitor early warning systems throughout the decision-making process 
(Lele and Lihua, 2016).
Leiras et al. (2014) have recommended trends in disaster operations 
management and future activities that include humanitarian relief logis-
tics in case of disasters in literature (Leiras et al., 2014). Ozdamar and 
Ertem (2015) have studied the intervention and recovery phases, while 
Jain et al. (2017) have studied the mitigation phase in DRM processes. 
These have been systematically taken and have shown recommendations 
on ­future-proof fields (Ozdamar and Ertem, 2015; Jain et al., 2017). 
Chen et al. (2019) have taken into account the entire disaster manage-
ment process and reproduced the literature on smart systems in emer-
gency management in their studies. Fosso Wamba et al. (2015) have done 
systematic literature research involving Big Data applications in DRM 
practices and made suggestions on this issue. Goswami et al. (2018) have 
studied a literature on natural disasters that takes into account the meth-
ods of data mining and data analytics. In this study, they have presented 
definite methods such as statistical methodologies, ANN, clustering, text 
mining, time series, etc. (Fosso Wamba et al., 2015; Goswami et al., 
2018; Chen et al., 2019).
Projects already under way in the city of Ohio (United States) and certain 
parts of India have aimed at building AI-assisted models and using meteoro-
logical data to track rainfall regimes and predicting flooding through IoT. In 
addition, it is also known that Google has developed a project recommenda-
tion for AI to allow for the processing of flooding and forecasting of possi-
ble flooding in previous periods through the Google Emergency Alerts 
program. The objectives established in this project to manage AI practices in 
cases related to water-related disasters include the following items (The 
Water Policies Association, 2020):
	•	 To monitor weather and rainy regimes
	•	 To make periodic risk maps with dynamic-built databases
	•	 To insight into urban development strategies and include findings
	•	 To develop scenarios in risk planning processes
As well as international examples from the academic literature, the national 
examples implemented in Turkey are examined. Important projects are 
being undertaken including pioneering AI in different expertise areas under 
the framework of the “Digital Transformation Office”. Moreover, these 
projects are also aimed at promoting the use of Big Data in public services. 
The Ministry of Environment and Urbanization plans to support smart city 
practices within the “2020–2023 National Strategy of Smart Cities and 
Action Plan”. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) 
working under The Interior Ministry is installed “Disaster Management and 
Resolution Support System” (AYDES) using GIS tools. Therefore, the project 

Risk management  199
named AYDES-UZAL application is planned using GIS and RS (Memiş and 
Babaoglu, 2020b).
In addition to these applications which are implemented with the use of 
technological capabilities and a major component of DRM, other important 
projects leading the central administration of Turkey can be listed as exam-
ples (Memiş and Babaoglu, 2020b):
	•	 Seamless and Secure Communications System (KGH)
	•	 Integrated Contraction Alarm System (IKAS)
	•	 Turkey earthquake hazard map
	•	 Forecast and early warning center for flood
	•	 Bleed Failover Information System (TAMBIS)
	•	 Meteorological Data Information Presentation and Sales System 
(SEASON)
	•	 Numeric Air Forecast (SHT)
	•	 City Information Systems (KBS)
	•	 Turkey National Geographic Information Systems Infrastructure 
(TUCBS).
The applications in architectural design performed by using AI tools have 
been commonly preferred recently. The new methods including image recog-
nition, processing, and deep learning techniques using the Python and Image 
AI tools are developed to create the building load-bearing system. In the 
Building Information System, the main goal is to enable quick reviews over 
photos rather than from two-dimensional vector drawings and to generate 
up-to-date databases to extract inventory of the structure. Another innova-
tive application is the Disorder Control Assistant (DKS). This application is 
developed to examine the irregularities in building plans and the disorders 
that pose the risk to the project carrier system by experts (Bingöl et al., 
2020).
It is becoming increasingly common to use AI in architecture and urban 
planning disciplines. The examples of AI usage in these areas can be sorted 
as (Bingöl et al., 2020):
	•	 The estimation of the cost of buildings using AI in at early stages of 
design
	•	 The estimation time during construction
	•	 The decision optimization and risk analysis to reduce risk in case of 
traditional engineering methods remain limited
	•	 The production of plans for the future according to the building 
bylaws
	•	 The development and utilization of the AI design applications
	•	 The usage of structural risk assessment using technology opportunities.

10.3  DRR: A DECISION-MAKING SUPPORT SYSTEMS 
TOOL
According to the population estimations, about 250,000 people are added 
daily to the world population which is estimated at 6 billion days. This high 
population growth is generally observed in developing countries. The situa-
tion observed in Turkey is proportional to this development. In Turkey, the 
total population has nearly doubled in the last 30 years and also the popula-
tion of 2023 is expected to reach between 80 million and 90 million people. 
In addition, due to the Global Risk Index (2018), Turkey is 45th among 191 
countries in terms of being “high disaster risk” (Disaster and Emergency 
Management Presidency, 2018). According to the 2018 INFORM Risk 
Index (2018), Turkey has three years of “high disaster risk” in human and 
natural risk rankings. Also in the same index, Turkey ranks among countries 
with a “very high” level of overall risk levels in terms of “danger and expo-
sure”, “high” in terms of “vulnerability” and “low” in terms of “combat 
capacity” (Memiş and Babaoglu, 2020b).
Due to the increase in the number of disasters associated with rapid 
urbanization processes and global climate change, there has been a signifi-
cant increase in the problems experienced in principal services (environ-
ment, health, education, infrastructure, security, etc.) in urban areas. 
Moreover, many negative developments are driving today’s cities into a 
complicated, multi-variable, complex living environment to solve such as 
rural-to-urban exodus, the rebalancing of socio-economic levels among 
regions, the rapid consumption of natural resources and the observation of 
environmental destruction, urban development dynamics, etc. (Durduran 
and Geymen, 2008; Lin et al., 2015).
One of the problematic issues affected by the negative developments in 
urban areas is the processes of DRM. Actually, it is known that dealing with 
disasters is complex whether they are natural or anthropogenic. The DRR 
practices have been widely implemented in different levels including local, 
regional, and global by different actors including government agencies, pri-
vate institutions, non-governmental organizations, and community mem-
bers (Lee et al., 2011). These organizations generally focus on the disasters’ 
impacts on people’s lives, also responding to and recovering from disasters. 
The context of disaster management consists of four phases that are 
expressed as mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. On the other 
hand, most countries unfortunately have limited resources to manage disas-
ters. In addition to this, traditional disaster management tools remain weak 
against disasters becoming costlier and more devastating which is character-
ized by hierarchy and centralization (Kapucu and Garayev, 2011; Hedelin 
et al., 2017; Gerdan, 2018).
The realization of the goals and programs envisaged by the development 
plans is dependent upon the full coordination of the planning, implementa-
tion, monitoring, control and control system, and the full coordination of 

Risk management  201
urban institutions and the organization of them. These development plans 
are prepared based on the main idea that urban settlements are experiencing 
such a rapid change and development and principal objectives are crucial to 
foresee for addressing disaster-related problems in these settlements (Dilley, 
2006). In other words, as much as possible cooperation with exchange and 
sharing of data by disaster-serving institutions, the DRM processes can be 
more effective (TABIS, 2002). Space technology-based systems should be 
used for the purpose of collecting, compiling, storing, updating, organizing, 
analyzing, managing, and presenting data, especially by ensuring their full 
integration in decision-making processes in today’s rapidly changing condi-
tions. Other infrastructure elements that will meet this need can be listed as 
the establishment of a national disaster coordination and data center, estab-
lishment of a technological infrastructure for the disaster data bank, making 
legal arrangements, providing the necessary skilled human resources and 
also providing the budget for sustainability needs (Durduran and Geymen, 
2008; Inter-American Development Bank, 2010; Maskrey, 2011).
It is clear that the strategic plans are needed for the effective DRM sys-
tems. Actually, this system has to include data and stakeholders as decision 
makers to achieve success. These stakeholders are managers at national and 
local levels, professional bodies, financial institutions, non-governmental 
organizations, and voluntary organizations. DRM applications need to 
expand because local governmental institutions need to build up their 
capacities and provide for the participation of the range of stakeholders in 
order to manage successful and effective DRM practices. National and local 
level institutions should be enhanced to assist and advise in formulating all 
phases of DRM (Assilzadeh and Mansor, 2016; Dilley, 2006; Lin et al., 
2015).
Within this scope, in this section, it is aimed to reveal the role of decision 
support mechanisms that have a multi-stakeholder structure in disaster 
management processes. In addition, research and studies on the process of 
reducing disaster risks in national and international examples especially in 
urban areas through ICT tools.
10.3.1 The effectiveness of public stakeholders in 
DRR process
Despite continuing limitations and difficulties, DRR policies are necessary to 
prevent and reduce disaster risk in urban settlements (Pigeon and Rebotier, 
2016). Therefore, it is necessary to prioritize the actions and strategies to 
be implemented based on the current and accurate disaster data. There are 
various methods that can help in DRM processes. Besides these methods, 
the methods such as the Spatial Decision Support Systems, the Structured 
Decision Making, the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, or the Cost-Benefit 
Analysis are fundamental to help decision makers to develop actions and 
strategies (Dilley, 2006; Gregory et al., 2012; Nyimbili and Erden, 2018).

202  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
According to the well-known opinion on multi-stakeholder organiza-
tional processes, the provision of resources (budget, time, manpower, etc.) 
for people working in different institutions and goals such as the introduc-
tion of the final product at the end of decision-making processes can only be 
achieved at the end of processes that can be managed collaboratively. 
Moreover, the timely sharing of accurate and valid information between 
stakeholders is the most critical issue of an effective management process in 
the case of disasters (Inter-American Development Bank, 2010; Lantada et 
al., 2020). The multidimensional structure of disasters makes local govern-
ments and their cooperation more important in different sectors and differ-
ent levels (international, regional, national, and local) (TÜSEV, 2013; 
Hedelin et al., 2017). For example, how to manage cooperation with non-
governmental organizations and volunteering potential with an institutional 
structure is an important problem in the DRM process. As a solution to this 
problem, cooperation is the most basic point of integrated DRM practices 
(Maskrey, 2011; Babaoğlu, 2017; Yaman and Çakır, 2018).
It is necessary to mention an important situation that has created a dif-
ferentiation in the integrated disaster management structure in Turkey. 
The structural changes in the disaster management on multi-stakeholder 
have gained more importance strategically in national scaled studies. 
Besides, it has been realized in the form of the cooperation between local 
governments and different stakeholders in all phases of DRM practices. In 
order to carry out these processes which are stated to be of a complex 
structure, it is necessary to define them as a kind of “public issue” and 
identify the stakeholders (Kadıoğlu, 2017; Yaman and Çakır, 2018; Memiş 
and Babaoğlu, 2020b).
Cities are risk pools in terms of disasters today. The rapid and unplanned 
urbanization of cities invites dangers in areas at risk of natural disasters 
(Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, 2009). For this reason, the dam-
age of natural disasters is increasing exponentially. The solution is designing 
the process of urbanization considering disaster risks. Hence, the central 
and local authorities have important responsibilities related to reducing the 
disaster risks in DRM processes (Okada, 2004; Hedelin et al., 2017).
The disaster risk assessment is a fundamental part of DRM. It can be said 
that it is a pillar for an informed decision-making process. The efforts on 
DRM can be challenging to evaluate due to they remain invisible until a 
disaster event occurs. The attempt to measure risk management is a signifi-
cant challenge from the conceptual, scientific, technical, and numerical per-
spectives when faced with natural phenomena. Indicators of these processes 
must be transparent, robust, representative, and easily understood by public 
policymakers at national, subnational, and urban levels (Carreno et al., 
2007; Lantada et al., 2020).
Besides these indicators, successful communication is one of the key 
aspects for disaster risks in context characterized by multiple stakeholders, 
high levels of ambiguity, complexity, and uncertainty. As an important 

Risk management  203
profession, risk communication has to a great extent been focused on com-
munication between professionals and the public, and less attention has 
been paid to communication between professionals. Although, it is clear 
that in order to understand how DRM systems work, and how one can 
design them so as to avoid blocking the “informational arteries”, to exam-
ine risk communication among professionals is crucial (Lin et al., 2015; 
Hedelin et al., 2017).
The simultaneous and coordinated studies of different institutions are fre-
quent currently around the world when it comes to disaster management. It 
is observed that the “working together” principle is carried out more quickly, 
coordinated, and effectively by means of ICT. In other words, ICT plays a 
critical role in the development of organizational intervention capacities. 
According to published statistics, the use of ICT in DRM processes has 
reached the level of 30% worldwide as of 2006 (Gerdan, 2018). Similarly, it 
is stated that IoT systems act as an important “catalyst” in terms of increas-
ing the effectiveness of disaster management processes. These systems can be 
defined as an ecosystem formed by devices capable of detecting and process-
ing data, communicating with each other via the Internet which mainly con-
tributes to the post-disaster process. The usage areas of these systems can be 
listed as follows which are actively used in disaster management processes 
(Horita et al., 2018; Küçük et al., 2019):
	•	 The accessibility to faster and more accurate information about the 
disaster zone and disaster victims
	•	 The faster decoupling of search, rescue, first aid teams to site
	•	 The facilitating the post-disaster management process
	•	 The management platform for measuring building damage situations
	•	 The reducing risk with smart city monitoring applications
	•	 The establishment of a DRM system with wireless sensor network 
technology
	•	 The establishment of sustainable communication infrastructure.
The implementation of an effective and successful integrated DRM process 
is based on the use of innovative technological opportunities and the devel-
opment of strategies for the pre- and post-disaster periods with the correct 
distribution of resources by decision makers. There are two main stages of 
this multidisciplinary process: (a) The pre-disaster period and (b) the post-
disaster period (Memiş and Babaoğlu, 2020a).
	
a)	Areas of technology usage in the pre-disaster period: Identification 
(ID) and measurement of risks, forecasts, and forecasts for disasters
	
b)	Areas of technology usage in the post-disaster period: Monitoring and 
monitoring of disasters, the establishment of early warning systems, 
ensuring stakeholder coordination.

204  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
In summary, it is clear that the local governments should focus their 
efforts to implement the strategies related to risk reduction in decision-
making processes. Therefore, these local authorities should bring definite 
actions and strategies to the forefront such as governance and financial 
protection, an optimal level of performance, etc. In Figure 10.3, a model 
is presented to ensure the predicted improvements in DRR process and to 
solve the identified problems. According to this model, essential elements 
of an effective and successful disaster management process have been 
defined as the coming together of stakeholders in policy and practice, 
the development of social capacity, the improvement of existing physical 
conditions in relation to other conditions (economic, social and environ-
mental), etc. Based on these criteria, important outcomes are expected, 
such as implementing the decision support mechanisms through partici-
patory processes, developing action plans and strategies, and increasing 
the resilience capacity.
10.3.2  Information and communication technology 
(ICT)-enabled risk reduction for resilient 
urban systems
It is becoming increasingly important to develop strategies and policies 
aimed to reduce disaster risks in urban areas. As many local, national, and 
international actors are involved in this process, civic initiatives are becom-
ing important (Babaoğlu, 2017). Two main strategies are being adopted to 
reduce these risks. The first one is the implementation of “urban gentri-
fication” practices in the existing urban settlements and the other is the 
continuation of the construction processes in the built environment tak-
ing into account the disaster risks (Okada, 2004; Memiş and Babaoğlu, 
2020b). An important tool that has become prominent in recent years in the 
Figure 10.3  Conceptual model for achieving inclusive developments.
(Prepared by the author, adopted from Geekiyanage et al., 2020.)

Risk management  205
implementation of both options is technological innovation. In other words, 
decision-making mechanisms (politicians, scientists, managers, non-govern-
mental organizations, private sector organizations, etc.) have accelerated 
their studies on solving urban problems and their focus is on technology in 
urban areas (Horita et al., 2018).
The ICT-supported developments have started to gain intensity both in 
solving problems experienced in urban areas and in improving the quality of 
life (Turkish Informatics Association, 2016). The role of ICT in DSSs has 
been emphasized both in “Sendai Framework for Risk Reduction” pub-
lished by the United Nations in 2015 and “International Strategy for Disaster 
Reduction (UNISDR)” within the scope of DRR at national and interna-
tional levels (UNISDR, 2004; Gerdan, 2018). Based on this point, the rele-
vant authorities have focused on the development and dissemination of 
DSSs based on GIS and disaster management practices especially at the local 
level in recent years. Figure 10.4 presents a relational scheme for setting up 
DSSs based on GIS.
ICTs are used not only in urban areas but also in management processes. 
The concepts such as digital management, e-governance, mobile democracy, 
e-democracy have emerged along with the transfer of management processes 
to the digital environment. The complex problems of the age in which we 
live necessitate interdisciplinary work and cooperation (Garschagen, 2016; 
Yaman and Çakır, 2018; Horita et al., 2018). The processes of DRM and 
emergency management have now begun to become the focus of public 
administration. Actually, these processes have not received sufficient atten-
tion and relevance in recent years. In the era of digitalization, in parallel 
with the digital transformation in public administration, the adaptation of a 
Figure 10.4  Theoretical framework of GIS-based decision support system.
(Prepared by the author, adopted from Kapucu and Garayev, 2011.)

206  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
field such as disaster and emergency management with technology is inevi-
table. It is known that DSS has two important goals such as the communica-
tion between stakeholders and providing real-time data and is also used 
effectively at local, regional, and national levels.
Collecting data from urban areas with various technological equipment 
and applications will minimize the damage of a disaster that may occur on 
a national and local scale. Moreover, converting these collected data into 
information and intelligent applications through analytical processes is 
another important issue in risk reduction for resilient urban systems. The 
sharing of data collected by various methods in smart cities with institutions 
(AFAD, university, and civil society) will pave the way for the implementa-
tion of smart disaster and emergency applications. The technological facili-
ties that are used or can be used in this issue are listed as follows (Yaman 
and Çakır, 2018; Varol, 2017; Horita et al., 2018; Türe, 2018; Memiş and 
Babaoğlu, 2020b):
	•	 Integrated Disaster Management Systems: A system based on the coop-
eration of different sectors and specializations in the process of multi-
dimensional and complex structured disaster management. Among the 
components of this system, there exist Disaster Information Systems 
(ABIS), intelligent disaster maps, and mobile applications (Disaster 
Knowledge Base, Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency 
Earthquake Mobil, etc.). The components of disaster information 
systems include real-time information, decision-making mechanisms, 
system users, policies and strategies, technological infrastructure, and 
implementation plans.
	•	 IoT: Technological tool which is used in risk management studies to 
obtain data against possible disaster risks using a wireless sensor net-
work. It has been at the forefront since the early 2000s. It is found in 
many fields from agriculture to transportation. It is actively used in the 
reduction of disaster risks before the disaster, as well as in the stages of 
intervention and improvement after the disaster.
	•	 Social Media Tools: Tools which serve the purposes of detecting risks 
using Big Data, installing early warning systems, reducing risks using 
ML method. By means of Big Data generated by social media tools, 
different issues can be raised such as disaster risk detection, ensur-
ing stakeholder integration, and accessing real-time data that allows 
for different analyses. It is seen that new methods are used to benefit 
social media tools such as Twitter, Facebook through disasters such as 
floods, fires, typhoons, earthquakes, and hurricanes that occur around 
the world today.
	•	 The Concept of Smart City: A structure that uses intensive ICT 
and combines digital technologies with an understanding of urban 
life and sustainability. This concept is defined as an “augmented 
reality”. At all stages of disaster management (AI, IoT, Big Data, 

Risk management  207
robots, drones, 3D, and CHIP) are located under the upper roof of 
“Disaster 4.0”, known as the technology that enables vehicles to 
become integrated. It also provides important benefits such as the 
cost reduction, resource efficiency, and improving the quality of life 
of citizens with the integration of ICTs into urban areas. In addi-
tion, it is aimed to constitute mechanisms which track how certain 
infrastructure and superstructure systems work with the concept of 
a smart city, as well as to collect data and increase the effectiveness 
of urban services.
The correct, effective, and rational use of ICTs that guide both urban plan-
ning and DRM processes may not be possible in all circumstances. The fac-
tors that cause this problem, which is more common on a local scale can be 
listed as follows:
	•	 The lack of knowledge and inadequacies about smart city applications
	•	 The problems with processing and converting existing data on disas-
ters into information
	•	 The state of “governance” does not occur as a result of the fact that 
each institution remains in its own jurisdiction
	•	 The disruptions in communication and information sharing between 
institutions
	•	 The lack of resources and competent technical personnel
	•	 The lack of a clear explanation of what data institutions and organiza-
tions produce
	•	 Not creating data inventories that should be kept regularly
	•	 The lack of clarity and clarity of the planning system
So, what can be done to make more efficient and trouble-free use of the tech-
nological facilities used to minimize and eliminate disaster risks in urban 
areas? The answer to this question can be varied in residential areas with 
different technological infrastructure facilities and disaster experiences. On 
the other hand, disaster information systems developed at the national and 
international levels show significant similarities in the main common points 
of solution proposals. These recommendations can be grouped into four 
groups:
	
a.	The establishment of technology-based and open-access National Di-
saster Coordination Centers at the national level
	
b.	The development of international cooperation in terms of the use of 
satellite communication systems
	
c.	The clarification of standard terminology and concepts for disaster 
information systems
	
d.	The determination of policies and strategies for disaster management 
in the medium and long term

10.3.3  DRR policies: regional, national, and 
international perspectives
It is becoming increasingly common for disaster data to be stored in data-
bases digitally worldwide. No standard has been developed for the data to 
be stored stands out as a significant shortcoming. Disaster databases are 
becoming more and more powerful and meaningful and disaster data can 
be displayed on maps instantly with the development of GIS day by day. 
The development levels of countries and their exposure level to disasters 
directly affect their studies in this field. As it is known, developed coun-
tries use technology at a more advanced level in disaster data (Garschagen, 
2016; Duman and Gökgöz, 2018). Disaster data in their countries of origin, 
archive, inventory of disasters in the form of aggregated a database or an 
estimate of the domain of the project is the focal point of this type. These 
steps with using current data are being executed by using innovative tech-
nologies and projects when looking at the overall functioning of DRR. In 
addition, data on human and economic losses are usually taken into account 
in disaster inventory studies.
Based on this point, it is known that the databases created at the regional, 
national, and international levels related to disasters are created according 
to the type of archiving in urban settlements and where the disasters 
occurred. In Figures 10.5 and 10.6, application examples can be listed as 
follows at the local, regional, national, and international levels using images 
of application interfaces (Türe, 2018; Duman and Gökgöz, 2018; Disaster

it is aimed to provide convenience for citizens residing in Beylikdüzü 
District to find out the gathering areas closest to their homes in advance 
and to be present in these areas after the disaster within the scope of 
the project.
	•	 The Disaster Information System (ABIS) Project: The project is devel-
oped and implemented by Umraniye Municipality in Istanbul city. It is 
a database that regularly and systematically stores disasters that have 
occurred at the local level from the year 2017 to present. In addition, 
this project aims to determine and manage all the existing capacity 
of the district against disasters by using GIS technologies in DRM 
processes.
The realization of the goals and programs envisaged by the development 
plans in the direction of solving problems related to disasters today depends 
only on the effective operation of the planning, implementation, monitoring, 
supervision, and control system in full coordination. The basis of this system 
is accurate, up-to-date, reliable, and standard information. When this sys-
tem is again operated in an organized manner and full coordination between 
the country’s institutions, it can become efficient and effective in the direc-
tion of the country’s development. Such an environment can only be carried 
out with the ability of an effectively functioning state system, the qualified 
manpower, the high technological information, and hardware infrastruc-
ture. It should be remembered that minimizing the damages of natural and 
anthropogenic disasters is possible with the effective use of a fast, up-to-
date, and operable information system during the studies, precautions to be 
taken and disasters to be carried out before the disaster.
10.4  CONCLUSION
It is becoming increasingly important to develop strategies and policies 
aimed to reduce disaster risks in urban areas. Decision-making mechanisms 
(politicians, scientists, managers, non-governmental organizations, private 
sector organizations, etc.) have accelerated their studies on solving urban 
problems and their focus is on technology in urban areas (Horita et al., 
2018).
The processes of DRM and emergency management have now begun to 
become the focus of public administration. Actually, these processes have 
not received sufficient attention and relevance in recent years. In the era of 
digitalization, in parallel with the digital transformation in public adminis-
tration, the adaptation of a field such as disaster and emergency manage-
ment with technology is inevitable. It is known that DSS has two important 
goals such as the communication between stakeholders and providing real-
time data and is also used effectively at local, regional, and national levels. 

Risk management  213
Collecting data from urban areas with various technological equipment and 
applications will minimize the damage of a disaster that may occur on a 
national and local scale. Moreover, converting these collected data into 
information and intelligent applications through analytical processes is 
another important issue in risk reduction for resilient urban systems. The 
sharing of data collected by various methods in smart cities with institutions 
(Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, University, Civil Society) 
will pave the way for the implementation of smart disaster and emergency 
applications.
As a result, it is necessary to develop modern methods through techno-
logical innovations and provide all kinds of resources (time, budget, quali-
fied people, technical support, etc.) to risk management processes before any 
disaster instead of focusing on crisis management processes after any disas-
ter with traditional methods. In other words, there is a significant change in 
the axis of frequently used methods and adopted approaches related to the 
disaster recovery in urban areas. The easy access to the technological oppor-
tunities (AI, Big Data, sensors, etc.) is an important and essential need in 
terms of the development of urban infrastructure by local governments 
which want to provide their citizens a safe and high quality-of-life physical 
environment in urban planning process within the understanding of sustain-
able development. While not only the concept of DRM but also urban plan-
ning studies have an extremely complex and multidimensional structure, 
ICTs based decision-making systems are needed for disaster risks in urban 
areas, especially at the local level.
When successful examples are examined in terms of DRM processes 
throughout the world, it is clear that the success of these examples depends 
on various parameters such as focusing on the DRM processes accurately 
and in a comprehensive manner, developing policies and actions due to the 
disaster risk types, the coordination between central and local authorities 
and also being conscious related differentiated disasters after many experi-
ences, etc. It should be remembered that it is necessary to think about pre-
ventive and protective measures before any disasters occur; there is no 
benefit in regretting after they occur.

222  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
11.1  INTRODUCTION
One of the substantial components of smart cities is data, which is regarded 
as “the new oil” (Agrawal et al., 2019) for artificial intelligence (AI) and 
intelligent machines. Big data analysis can be done through AI, which uses 
computers and machines to imitate the human mind in learning, problem-
solving and decision-making abilities and simulate human behaviours (IBM, 
2020). Therefore, big data and AI-based systems are interconnected, and 
they directly affect our lives and lead to the digital transformation of cities 
(Zomaya and Sakr, 2017).
AI, like any new technology, brings both opportunities and risks. On the 
one hand, AI enables smart solutions for cities and increases citizens’ quality 
of life by providing several benefits. These can be listed as better public ser-
vices, cleanliness, sustainability, improved health systems, combating cli-
mate change, increased defence and security, efficiency in production and 
environments where urban challenges are minimised (Diran et al., 2021; 
Allam and Dhunny, 2019). On the other hand, when considering the use of 
AI as a part of smart cities, one of the questions that arise is the privacy of 
citizens and the protection of personal data. Thinking machines lead to ethi-
cal discussions with the collection of more personalised data that may vio-
late the privacy and rights of individuals.
Much of citizens’ personal information can be processed, analysed, and 
stored to increase the development of smart cities (Clever et al., 2018). As a 
result of cooperation between companies and countries, sharing this infor-
mation and even selling it by auction causes sensitive data to be easily deci-
phered (Chen et al., 2012; Kitchin, 2016). Therefore, the possibility of 
creating intelligent robots raises ethical debates. Herschel and Miori (2017) 
define ethics as “an analysis of conduct that can cause benefit or harm to 
other people”. As the success and complexity of AI increase as it develops, 
its intelligibility decreases. To secure the safety of personal data, it must be 
managed correctly in terms of ethical rules.
Pew Research Center and Elon University’s Imagining the Internet 
Center researched experts, business and policy leaders and researchers to 
determine where ethical AI will evolve ten years from now. Accordingly, 
most of the respondents expressed concern about the long-term moral 
consequences of progress in AI (Rainie et al., 2021). In another study 
conducted by KPMG (2020), 90% of respondents mentioned the need to 
have an AI ethical policy, and 44% noted that they have already imple-
mented it. Considering that AI will enable more than 30% of smart city 
applications by 2025 (Diran et al., 2021), it is possible to say that munic-
ipalities and private companies have started to implement ethical and 
reliable AI principles. Although these frameworks are voluntary today, 
this fast pace of growing industry forces governments and businesses to 
implement mandatory legal requirements for AI. In fact, in its AI Strategy 
published in 2018, the European Commission also emphasised that the 

Ethical rules  223
legal and ethical infrastructure should be ready for AI technology and 
drew a roadmap for this. Given the significant roles of AI in smart cities, 
this chapter provides an overview of ethical rules and personal data 
protection.
11.2  DATA ETHICS AND AI: WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS 
ABOUT?
The role and usage areas of AI applications in our lives are increasing day 
by day. Although it appears mainly at the micro-level, such as computer 
games, home robots, mobile phone applications, it is also used in smart 
cities with functions such as face recognition, remote health services, and 
autonomous unmanned vehicles. To measure the success of these applica-
tions, ensure their sustainability and provide better services, the collection, 
usage and storage of big data, which we can also define as the big bang, 
become inevitable.
As cities become more innovative, the ethics behind this data has begun 
to be questioned. For example, Goldman Sachs has been under investiga-
tion for allegedly using an AI algorithm that discriminates against women 
by keeping male Apple card users’ credit limits higher (Telford, 2019). Not 
only citizens but also companies and governments question ethics. For 
example, Los Angeles has sued IBM for misusing data it collects through 
its popular weather app. (Dean, 2019). Therefore, they are not considered 
unfair in questioning who collects and stores this big data and for what 
purposes it is used.
One of the main reasons for questioning who collects and stores big data 
and for what purposes it is used is that the speed of technology is developing 
faster than the knowledge of algorithms and programming. For example, a 
robot named Eugene Goostman became the first robot to win the Turin 
Competition. Goostman ushered in a new era by convincing most people 
that they were conversing with a human being rather than a computer 
(Bossmann, 2016).
Computer ethics was put forward by the American Professor Norbert 
Wiener in the mid-1940s, just before the information explosion that would 
occur after the Second World War. The concept refers to the comprehensive 
analysis of the social and ethical problems of the developing information 
technologies with the help of a particular methodology. Well-structured eth-
ical frameworks guide individuals, institutions and cities in giving logical 
and rational decisions (Chang, 2021).
Generally, ethics is “a code of conduct for people to decide what is right 
and wrong, which is beyond the law” (Chang, 2021). However, with the 
introduction of cultural norms, it becomes difficult to define AI ethically. In 
this context, norms and standards are still being discussed, and it is not pos-
sible to come across a general rule or procedure. As stakeholders in the AI 

224  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
ecosystem act in their interests (e.g., profit maximisation of companies, gov-
ernments control of societies), many ethicists are concerned about the diffi-
culty of enforcing ethical behaviour (Rainie et al., 2021). In the next section, 
the reasons for the need for AI guidelines and principles and the steps taken 
in this context will be explained.
11.3 THE ADVENT OF AI REGULATION AND THE 
LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The increase in the volume of data required by AI for machine learning 
has revealed the need to establish a legal basis. These data contain the 
personal information of individuals living in the city. For this reason, esti-
mation and modelling can be made between these heterogeneous groups. 
For instance, in the Cambridge Analytica scandal that occurred in 2016, 
the content shared by people on their social media accounts is analysed 
and predicted by algorithms, even though people do not reveal any politi-
cal views. Therefore, through the technologies we use, all the information 
we share, whether publicly or privately, can display the personal opinions 
of individuals. From this point of view, the Cambridge Analytica scandal 
and many scandals that have not yet been fully surfaced have started legal 
and ethical discussions about the use of personal data in AI technology 
(Gultekin Varkonyi, 2020).
The accident, which occurred when the sensors of the Tesla vehicle in 
autopilot could not detect the white pickup truck, was recorded in his-
tory as the first fatal case caused by a driverless car (The Tesla Team, 
2016). In line with AI’s powerful and shocking effect in social areas, 
discussions have arisen about the need to set ethical rules clearly and 
inclusively. Therefore, various AI guidelines, policies and White papers 
have been published with the initiative of all stakeholders, especially 
since 2016.
For example, the European Commission emphasised in its AI Strategy 
published in 2018 that, it is necessary to be prepared socioeconomically and 
financially for the AI transformation that will take place in the European 
Union (EU). It is also pointed out that the legal and ethical infrastructure 
should be ready for AI technology. It is possible to list some of the various 
documents published by the EU with ethical principles to draw a roadmap 
as follows:
	•	 “Position on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence” – The Greens (Green 
Working Group Robots)
	•	 “Report with recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law 
Rules on Robotics” – European Parliament.
	•	 “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI” – High-Level Expert Group 
on Artificial Intelligence

Ethical rules  225
	•	 “An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, 
Principles, and Recommendations” – AI4People
	•	 “EU European ethical Charter on the use of Artificial Intelligence in 
judicial systems and their environment Council of Europe” – European 
Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ)
	•	 “EU Statement on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and ‘Autonomous’ 
Systems” – European Commission
	•	 “Guidelines on Artifıcial Intelligence and Data Protection” – Council 
of Europe
In parallel with these documents, AI systems should be lawful, ethical and 
robust to be considered trustworthy. For instance, the “Ethics Guidelines 
for Trustworthy AI” document provides recommendations on improving 
auditing for AI technologies. Thus, in the report “Guidelines on Artificial 
Intelligence and Data Protection”, published in 2019, the Council of Europe 
(2019) states that protecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and per-
sonal data is essential while developing AI applications. In addition, it is 
stated that the functioning of democracies’ social and ethical values should 
not be neglected, and risks should be minimised by considering them within 
the scope of “responsible innovation”.
When intergovernmental examples are evaluated, the document titled 
“OECD Principles on AI” shared by the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2019 encourages innovative 
and reliable AI that respects human rights and democratic values. 
Accordingly, G20 adopted the human-centred AI Principles. For instance, 
at the global level Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
published “Ethically Aligned Design” both in 2016 and 2019. Additionally, 
The Future of Life Institute’s Asilomar AI Principles and the World 
Economic Forum can be an example of public and private partnership 
that tries to guide ethical AI. Fundamentally, these principles aim to pro-
vide guidance in the regulatory framework and inform about the AI sys-
tems (SAS, 2021).
In addition, governments themselves are attempting to create a roadmap 
for ethical AI. China and the USA lead the way in guidelines and policy as 
well as AI applications. “AI Principles & Ethics” shared by the Smart Dubai 
or “Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence – Four Perspectives on the 
Economy, Employment, Skills and Ethics” shared by the Finnish Ministry of 
Economic Affairs and Employment can be given as other examples. It is pos-
sible to see rapid steps to legalise and regulate AI.
Besides governments, technology giants are also in similar efforts to con-
tribute to the emerging field of AI ethics. For instance, IBM, Google, Intel, 
Microsoft, Apple and Facebook published AI ethics guidelines to protect 
individuals’ privacy and data. Thus, they are forming ethics groups within 
the companies. According to Ahmad et al. (2021), the main reason for hav-
ing such policies and guidelines for tech giants and multinational 

226  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
corporations is to strengthen their image. In addition, companies that ignore 
the impact of data and AI ethics raw reactions from employees and consum-
ers and realise that it threatens their profitability in several ways, such as 
waste of resources, product development and distribution (Blackmann, 
2020).
However, Metzinger (2019) argues that instead of talking about trustwor-
thy AI machines, we should focus on reliable individuals and governments. 
In addition, it was stated that these principles are not comprehensive enough 
because they are prepared from a Western perspective. From this point of 
view, it would not be wrong to expect future ethical guidelines that will 
contribute to the development of AI to diversify according to their nature in 
the world’s countries (SAS, 2021).
11.4  PRINCIPLES OF DATA PRIVACY, ETHICS AND 
PROTECTION
Various methods are used to ensure the protection of data. These include 
(Lee et al., 2016):
Technical solutions that prevent the loss of data or its access by others.
Social solutions that involve transparent information on transfer and 
awareness about the data process stages.
Legal solutions that involve national and international regulations provided 
by the laws.
Various regulations have a legal basis at the national level. Some of them 
can be listed as US standards (e.g., the US Federal Trade Commission’s Fair 
Information Practices), European standards (e.g., Data Protection Directive 
95/46/EC and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]), Asian 
regulations (e.g., Hong Kong Personal Data Privacy Ordinance. The most 
widely referenced source of data protection at the international level is the 
OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of 
Personal Data, adopted in 1980 and amended in 2013 (Greenleaf, 2015). 
Therefore, eight principles for the protection of data privacy and data ethics 
are summarised below:
	
1.	Collection Limitation Principle: Personal data must be obtained for 
the stated purpose and following the law. Additionally, the person 
must be aware of the data subject being collected.
	
2.	Data Quality Principle: Personal data must be accurate, complete and 
up to date. In this context, it is recommended to periodically evaluate 
the old life cycle and update the data when necessary.

Ethical rules  227
	
3.	Purpose Specification Principle: Collected personal data should be 
specified within the scope of collection date and purposes of collec-
tion. It is expected that the data will not deviate from the purpose of 
collection by waiting and being fair.
	
4.	Use Limitation Principle: Personal data should not be disclosed or 
used for other purposes without the consent of the person concerned 
or outside the law.
	
5.	Security Safeguards Principle: Security measures should be taken 
against risky situations involving the breach of personal data (e.g., 
unauthorised access, erasure, loss, modification of data).
	
6.	Openness Principle: Privacy laws, policies and standards regarding 
personal data should be clearly stated and shared with the public.
	
7.	Individual Participation Principle: Data subjects must have the author-
ity to query, access and control their personal data and correct if the 
data is inaccurate.
	
8.	Accountability Principle: An accountability mechanism and a data 
controller are required for each data in use. It is recommended that a 
separate assessment be made to address risks and harms.
The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) has accordingly published 
principles to achieve its 2030 Agenda. In addition to the items mentioned 
above, UNDG also underlined the topics of applying stricter standards for 
sensitive data (e.g., vulnerable populations, children and youth) and legalis-
ing agreements with potential third-party collaborators. Although it is pos-
sible to add different dimensions when transferring international laws to 
the national level, OECD Privacy Guidelines are the common principles for 
protecting data privacy and data ethics, which may impact individual liber-
ties and cross-border transfer of the data.
11.5  ETHICS IN PRACTICE
While the legislative framework aims to protect citizens’ security and provide 
fundamental rights, individuals are concerned that AI might have unfore-
seen consequences or be used maliciously (European Commission, 2019b). 
Despite all these regulatory initiatives of the stakeholders, the majority of 
the world and the United States mentioned that they are concerned about 
data security, and 79% of India are worried about their data being sold to 
third parties (Pearce, 2021). The following shortlist on protecting personal 
data in AI applications clearly demonstrates the need for more robust AI 
measures while making their cities smart (Table 11.1).
Therefore, the main question arises: “Are ethical guidelines really effective 
in applicability?”. McNamara et al. (2018) found that guidelines have 
almost zero effect on the behaviour of professionals or students. Furthermore, 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 

228  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
(OHCHR) has prepared a report examining various topics (e.g., freedom of 
movement, right to health and education) on how AI-based machine learn-
ing technologies affect individuals’ right to security. According to the report 
results, it is noteworthy that the situation is getting worse rather than being 
improved each year. Peggy Hicks, the OHCHR Director of Thematic 
Engagement, warned that if action is not taken today, it will be more chal-
lenging to know the extent of the problems as the damage increases in the 
future (United Nations, 2021).

Ethical rules  229
Among the main reasons for this ineffectiveness can be listed as the imple-
mentation of the directives on a voluntary basis without any enforcement 
mechanisms, the creation of principles behind “closed-door industry set-
tings” away from the field and their development with a view to the profit-
ability of companies (Campolo et al. 2017). It should not be forgotten that 
the reactions from company employees or citizens will cause businesses to 
lose their reputation and decrease their profitability. Therefore, AI ethics 
guidelines should require a sensitive and ethical approach based on univer-
sal principles rather than being viewed as a checklist. Moreover, instead of 
waiting for stakeholders to comply with these rules, it is necessary to ensure 
that they make comprehensively informed and empathy-based decisions 
(Hagendorff, 2020).
11.6  KEY ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Various smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Quick-
Response code, blockchain, cloud computing and AI are essential for the 
development and sustainability of smart cities. Among them, AI is consid-
ered the most destructive in terms of technology, economics, policies, and 
human existence due to its autonomous nature (European Commission, 
2021). Therefore, the other side of the medallion gives rise to various ethical 
concerns.
According to Perrault et al. (2019) research of documents on AI ethics 
created in 2016–2019 by various institutions and societies, it has been found 
that fairness, interpretability and explainability, transparency, accountabil-
ity, data privacy and security were among the main ethical considerations in 
machine learning models. European Commission (2019a) also mentioned 
that in order for AI to be trustworthy; it should meet the seven require-
ments: (1) human agency and oversight, (2) technical robustness and safety, 
(3) privacy and data governance, (4) transparency, (5) diversity, non-discrim-
ination and fairness, (6) environmental and societal well-being (7) account-
ability. Figure 11.1 shows some of the significant ethical considerations of 
AI in smart cities highlighted in the literature (Ahmad et al., 2021; Yigitcanlar 
et al., 2020; Clever et al., 2018), which are summarised as follows.
While increasing citizens’ quality of life, it is vital to build cities by evalu-
ating the ethical compatibility of technologies, not violating the fundamen-
tal rights of individuals and ensuring data privacy (Clever et al., 2018). 
Accordingly, this section will discuss key ethical issues.
11.6.1  Human-centric ethics
All kinds of issues that can affect individuals directly or indirectly and even 
threaten their lives and personal rights are evaluated within human-centred 
ethics. Smart city technologies should be used to maximise the interests of 

230  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
individuals rather than be the main purpose. In this context, it is possible 
to categorise the issues under two main dimensions: social-ethical concerns 
and data-related concerns. These concepts will be evaluated in detail below.
11.6.1.1  Social ethical concerns
Ethical issues that affect or concern society or individuals are dealt with in 
a social context. AI-based smart city technologies are produced by people 
who differ from each other in terms of several attributes such as religion, 
race, skills, wealth and resources. Whether these technologies take these dis-
criminations into account and become a threat to humanity in terms of 
causing them to lose jobs or creating inequalities forms the basis of the main 
social-ethical concerns.
11.6.1.1.1  Discrimination
While smart cities aim to increase the quality of life of people, they mainly 
provide this with high technological innovations. Therefore, excluding some 
groups (e.g., non-tech users, the elderly, disabled) is the primary concern. 
According to a study carried out in collaboration with the World Enabled 
Company and the University of California, it was determined that only 
four percent of the 1,200 projects produced by the six international devel-
opment agencies cater to the disabled and the elderly (Rowling, 2019). 
Consequently, it is discussed that it will be beneficial not for the whole 
society but privileged dominant society. On the other hand, McKinsey and 
Company’s (2021) research shows us that employees report that companies 
are becoming increasingly focused on these issues to reduce risks to equality 
and fairness.

11.6.1.1.2  Unemployment
Developing technologies have always frightened humanity. Robots mak-
ing people lose their jobs are among the most fundamental concerns. The 
AI workforce is particularly demanded in the high-tech and manufacturing 
sectors. For example, Singapore, Brazil, Australia, Canada and India were 
the fastest growing countries in AI recruitment between 2015 and 2019 
(Perrault et al., 2019). On the other hand, some researchers emphasise that 
transferring a particular job to machines will have both maintenance and 
social (e.g., lack of emotional exchange) costs. Therefore, they alleviate the 
concerns by considering that laying off people will not bring much profit to 
the firms (Donath, 2020).
On the other hand, there is also the optimistic view that AI will create 
more jobs for humans and contribute to economic growth (O’Neil, 2016). 
Rather than arguing about who will dominate the business world, the 
European Commission (2019a) states that trustworthy AI technologies will 
accurately place both AI machines and humans where their abilities and 
skills are appropriate, according to the nature of business. At the same time, 
it is anticipated that it will identify future business skills and offer advice for 
individuals to receive education to fill the jobs.
11.6.1.1.3 Wealth and skills inequality
Due to the high budgets of AI-based smart technologies, it is discussed that 
there will be a separation between developed and developing countries, 
which can lead to a widening of the difference. Financial resources and skills 
are considered a must for developing a smart city. Therefore, technologies 
and projects will significantly benefit wealthy cities (Clever et al., 2018). It 
is argued that the cost to cities that cannot compete with the current issues 
of AI-based technologies could be even more costly. On the other hand, 
ranking cities and destinations as “smart” may cause an increase or decrease 
in both national and foreign investments and tourism flows (Kitchin et al., 
2015). Therefore, smart cities will have a decisive influence on the competi-
tiveness of cities (Voda and Radu, 2018).
Accordingly, cities that will evaluate AI both as an advantage in closing 
the gap between developed countries and as a tool for achieving Sustainable 
Development Goals will profit in the long term. Moreover, even if they can-
not purchase AI technologies, receiving AI-as-a-service solutions from 
mobile devices will also positively affect the quality of life of individuals. 
For instance, farmers in Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania use a machine 
learning app called Nuru to identify leaf damage and monitor pests, which 
leads to revenue and food protection across East Africa (Strusani and 
Houngbonon, 2019).

232  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
11.6.1.2  Data-related ethical concerns
Big data can be accessed, stored and used quickly in our modern lives has 
revealed the need to deal with ethical issues concerning data. AI has the 
features of imitating the human brain and behaviours, face recognition, and 
identification (Hand, 2018). For instance, Blue Brain, the world’s first vir-
tual brain created by IBM, allows a machine to function just like a human 
brain (Lohi, 2018). While the issues such as for what purpose AI technolo-
gies collect the data, whether permission is obtained from users, and the 
interpretation of the data collection process is discussed in terms of data 
collection; concerns on sharing of data includes how the collected data are 
interpreted and its reliability (Ahmad et al., 2021). Besides the problems 
that can arise from AI systems, as with all intelligent technologies, there 
is the potential for data misuse, taught biases, security leaks and unethical 
distortions. In this context, these concerns, categorised under data-related 
ethics, will be evaluated in detail below.
11.6.1.2.1  Data biases
The Cambridge Dictionary defines algorithms as “a set of mathematical 
instructions or rules that, especially given to a computer, will help calculate 
an answer to a problem”. Algorithms are the basis for several AI decision 
tools. AI can make mistakes while learning and reaching conclusions, just 
like humans. The subjectiveness and hidden prejudice patterns created in 
different stages of the deep-learning process of AI algorithms that can cause 
discrimination is called data biases. The most basic categories of human bias 
that intelligent systems can inherit are currently seen as gender and racial 
biases (Wang and Siau, 2018). In a study conducted in 2018 by typing the 
chief executive officer (CEO) on Google images, for instance, it was found 
that male CEOs were shown more than women. The main reason for this is 
that only 5% of the CEOs in the Fortune 500 ranking were women and the 
algorithm made this generalisable for the whole search (Suresh and Guttag, 
2019). United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) states that gender bias in AI arises from stereotypical represen-
tations that are deeply ingrained in our societies, and
Only 22 % of all AI professionals are women. Because they are under-
represented in the industry, gender biases and stereotyping are being 
reproduced in AI technologies. It is not a coincidence that virtual per-
sonal assistants such as Siri, Alexa or Cortana are “female” by default. 
The servility and sometimes submissiveness they express are an example 
of how AI can (continue to) reinforce and spread gender bias in our 
societies.

Ethical rules  233
Similarly, Amazon realised that the algorithm created a bias against women 
while hiring since more men have applied over the past decade in 2015 
(Shin, 2020). Therefore, hidden bias might also be a serious ethical concern 
when recruiting. For instance, Google algorithms reduce the likelihood of 
high-paying job advertisements for African American name candidates as 
it associates with a criminal record or for women likely to become preg-
nant by analysing their social media (Tufekci, 2016). Another example can 
be given for AI-based translation services used by Facebook. In 2017, the 
worker who shared a photo with a bulldozer and wrote “good morning” 
was translated as “attack them”, causing him to be arrested for several 
hours (Cossins, 2018).
These algorithms, also known as black-box, may damage the candidates 
and the corporate image of the companies that are not aware of the bias. 
Since it is hard to undo and directly impacts humanity, which causes serious 
ethical debate, these biases should be eliminated at the beginning and create 
a transparent system (Pavaloui and Kose, 2017).
11.6.1.2.2  Data ownership
More personalised data is needed to provide better services for individuals 
of smart cities. For instance, it is possible to detect criminals by face recog-
nition or global positioning system tracking systems. Many of us click the 
“Accept my data to be shared” form without reading. However, the more 
personal data is shared, the more ethical considerations on data privacy 
raise (Clever et al., 2018). Since smart city technologies have a high budget 
and require technical knowledge, the data and the destiny of AI are mainly 
in the hands of large companies that can afford them (UNESCO, 2020). 
There is also evidence that citizens perceive local governments as untrust-
worthy partners in data handling (Thompson et al., 2015). Therefore, the 
main question arises: “Who will be responsible for the data?” and “Will they 
use this data for the benefit of society?”
Robots will not be able to function in society and uncertainty against the 
law, especially in terms of criminal liability. For example, when the autono-
mous vehicles of Uber and Tesla cause fatal accidents, although they claim 
that the technology itself causes the problem, lawsuits have been filed against 
them because they could not predict the accidents and take the necessary 
precautions.
Another issue that needs to be addressed in terms of ethics is whether AI 
can have the rights of the artist, authors, musicians or others. For example, 
AI, which analysed 346 Rembrandt paintings with deep learning, designed 
a painting called “the Next Rembrandt” with a 3D printer in 2016 (Baraniuk, 
2016). In 2019, Huawei completed the last two movements of Franz 
Schubert’s Symphony No. 8 by analysing his works after 197 years, using 
the AI algorithm (Huawei, 2019). Nevertheless, who can be determined as 
the author? The company which carried out the project, the designers of the 

234  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
system, the AI algorithm, or Franz Schubert? Therefore, to clarify all these 
questions, the data ownership and the rights of individuals should be clari-
fied within the framework of the law. UNESCO (2020) states, “We need to 
develop new frameworks to differentiate piracy and plagiarism from origi-
nality and creativity, and to recognize the value of human creative work in 
our interactions with AI”.
11.6.1.2.3  Privacy and informed consent
Vast amounts of big data are collected as the cities become smarter. These 
data, obtained in different ways, can be transferred between institutions, 
stored, analysed and even sold to third parties. Therefore, concerns arise 
about disclosing sensitive information (Chen et al., 2012; Kitchin, 2016). In 
a study conducted by McKinsey and Company (2021), the most critical AI 
risk was identified as “individual privacy” both in developing and developed 
countries. Therefore, it becomes necessary to protect this confidential infor-
mation with the consent of individuals.
The Free Dictionary defines privacy as “the state of being free from public 
attention or unsanctioned intrusion”. The protection of data privacy within 
smart cities is evaluated under three dimensions: the type of data being col-
lected, the purpose of collecting the data and who is responsible for collect-
ing the data. While the type of data is evaluated on a scale from personal to 
impersonal, the purposes of the data are on a scale ranging from basic ser-
vices provided to continuous surveillance (Zoonen, 2016; Coeckelbergh, 
2019). The privacy issue is controversial and may differ depending on the 
situation. For example, while data such as the date of birth entered on social 
media are general information, some may find it private. Concerns about 
privacy created by AI on individuals can be explained as follows:
	•	 Identification/Recognition: AI enables individuals to be more effec-
tively identified by institutions and governments. Besides facial and 
voice recognition, other scalable AI identification technologies include 
biometric data that helps detect lies or evaluate personality through 
expressions. Although identification provides reliance to the citizens in 
terms of detecting criminals, it also brings various concerns, especially 
the violation of privacy (European Commission, 2019a). Therefore, 
another privacy concern people may face is having their movements 
recorded without their knowledge and consent. For instance, citizens 
crossing the street at a red light are recognised and fined by smart 
cameras in Shenzhen, China. Moreover, through AI-based face-recog-
nition technology, their names are projected onto giant screens placed 
in the city to embarrass them (Baynes, 2018). Although this situation 
is perceived as unauthorised sharing of citizens’ data, it may vary in 
various situations such as coronavirus pandemic. For instance, citizens 

Ethical rules  235
demanded their personal data be captured and shared to prevent the 
spread of the virus.
	•	 Prediction and Profiling: AI can reveal sensitive information (e.g., 
emotions, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political view, location data) 
by predicting from big data. Moreover, it can classify and rank people 
and evaluate them under specific categories. For example, the social 
scoring system applied in China determines whether individuals can 
have rights such as credit, employment and access to social services 
(Deane, 2018).
	•	 Deep fake: Deep faking, which can result in identity theft or spread-
ing misinformation, means impersonating someone with AI-generated 
content. Therefore, unauthorised misuse of data constitutes another 
privacy concern. For instance, a UK-based energy company CEO 
was convinced that he was talking to the Hungarian supplier by the 
deep fake voice used by the scammers and sent 220,000 euros to their 
account (Penta Security, 2021).
Despite all these concerns, it is possible to ensure security with laws, regula-
tions and security measures. Apple, for example, utilises a payment mecha-
nism known as “tokenisation”, which offers extra security protection to 
consumers’ private data by validating their identification with a unique 
series of numbers (PwC, 2014). In addition to data privacy, informing indi-
viduals about the collection, purpose and future use of data and obtaining 
their consent is important in data ethics. In this context, it is important for 
people to be informed about the process and to have the right to participate 
or not.
11.6.1.2.4 Transparency, explainability and interpretation
Trust is an essential issue in the interaction of AI systems with humans. 
Key principles of reliability include transparency, accountability, impar-
tiality (lack of negative bias) and non-manipulation (Adamson et al., 
2019). Similarly, transparency has been considered one of the seven essen-
tial prerequisites for the realisation of “trustworthy” AI, according to the 
Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI, which released its report 
in April 2019. Research conducted by Jobin et al. (2019) on analysing 84 
principles and guidelines on ethical AI found that transparency is the most 
common concept argued, especially after 2016 and emphasised one of the 
key five principles.
Although studies on transparency have started to be seen in the literature 
since the 1990s, it gained importance after 2010 in parallel with the scan-
dals (Larsson and Heintz, 2020). Evaluation of trust towards users is related 
to how well the approach behind AI can be explained. The operability of the 
process in AI is not apparent in most cases. According to their inner faces, 
components are evaluated under three categories: white box, grey box, and 

236  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
black box (Suman et al., 2010). In particular, situations where the system’s 
decisions are not known are called black boxes. Therefore, individuals have 
the right to know both how and why decisions that affect them are taken 
(Coeckelbergh, 2019). In the GDPR of the EU, the provisions regarding the 
right to information about individual decisions taken by AI and algorithmic 
accountability are handled as the Right to Explanation (Goodman and 
Flaxman, 2016).
Realising the importance of this, companies take action to build trust. It 
is known that trust is one of the most valuable assets a company has. For 
instance, Deloitte (2019) states in a report that it aims for a transparent and 
responsible AI and communicates all processes with transparency to its 
employees and customers. At the same time, the GlassBox they developed 
allows the analysis of AI-supported algorithms inside black boxes.
Explainability is an essential feature of AI models in smart city applica-
tions. In addition to the explainability feature, which has become necessary 
in sensitive issues such as health and banking services to prevent biases, the 
data is also expected to be interpretable (Deloitte, 2021). For example, 
PredPol, used by the police in the USA, analyses data to identify potential 
criminals. In this way, there has been a significant decrease in the crimes 
committed.
11.6.1.2.5  Safety and security
As smart cities hold more and more big data each day, cyber-attack con-
cerns increase among individuals. Attackers may access, spread or process 
private data such as health conditions, race, account information or life-
style. For example, Marriott Hotel signed one of the most significant data 
breaches in history by stating that the data (e.g. payment card information, 
address, e-mail, passport numbers etc.) of 500 million visitors who stayed at 
Starwood property in 2018 were exposed to unauthorised access (Downs, 
2020).
According to research conducted by McKinsey and Company (2021), 
cyber security remained the most relevant AI risk both in emerging and 
developed countries. Mehmood et al. (2017) stated that 70% of smart city 
technologies are at risk due to insufficient security vulnerabilities. For exam-
ple, in 2016, hackers attacked well-known websites such as Twitter, Netflix 
and Amazon via weakly secured IoT devices, causing servers to be shut 
down (Woolf, 2016). Preventing such instances that cause concerns about 
the privacy and security of their data is vital for ensuring trust. In this regard, 
fundamental rights have always been considered a limit to cybersecurity 
within the EU (Eylemer and Besgur, 2020). In other words, mitigating risk 
should align with fundamental rights and freedom.
Additionally, scholars highlight that the security risks are not only associ-
ated with external attackers. Internal threats should be taken into account 
for preventing data loss and providing more comprehensive security 

Ethical rules  237
(Elmaghraby and Losavio, 2014). For instance, a smart building might use a 
face recognition system to prevent theft but ignore the internal attacker who 
has a record of the entrance to the apartment. Therefore, data should be 
carefully protected internally and externally at every stage (Al-Turjman et 
al., 2019).
11.6.2  Singularity/superintelligence
Types of AI are categorised under three categories (Joshi, 2019):
	•	 Artificial Narrow Intelligence (which refers to the existing AI tech-
nologies today)
	•	 Artificial General Intelligence (AI agents that can perceive and learn 
just like the human brain)
	•	 Artificial Superintelligence (AI agents that have a human level of intel-
ligence and even can surpass human abilities)
AI mentioned in the third category has superior intelligence and can make 
its own decisions is essential in terms of both ethics and safety (Bostrom and 
Yudkowsky, 2014). Therefore, singularity is another factor that shapes AI 
and ethical literature (Kurzweil, 2006). For instance, in 2017, citizenship of 
Saudi Arabia was given to the robot Sophia, and it became the first robot to 
be given legal personhood anywhere in the World. Moreover, why she did 
not even wear the black chador like Arab women became a debate (Sini, 
2016). So, the main question arises as: “What is the status of these future 
residents?”.
Another concern is that intelligent systems can make decisions by devel-
oping unexpected subgoals. For instance, a chess-playing robot might learn 
to kill people who switch off itself to improve its game skills (Bostrom and 
Yudkowsky, 2014). Another example can be given for Facebook’s AI-based 
chatbot robots. They have been shut down immediately after realising that 
they developed their own language (Baraniuk, 2017).
Because people are afraid of technologies they cannot control, they per-
ceive them as a threat to the future of the human species (Bostrom and 
Yudkowsky, 2014). Undoubtedly, both scientist and science fiction movies 
have a share in this. For example, Stephan Hawking and Elon Musk also 
supported this argument. However, it is shown that those who think this is 
dystopian thought and criticise the view are not those who work in AI (Calo, 
2017; Hagendorff, 2020). On the contrary, the National Science and 
Technology Council (2016) stated in the “Preparing for the future of artifi-
cial intelligence” that singularity has little effect on policies and thus should 
not be treated as a driving force. Although most opinions consider it unlikely 
that AI will take over humanity, it is an issue that needs to be monitored to 
maintain these technologies’ trust.

238  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
11.6.3  Machine ethics
According to the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (2020), “Machine 
ethics is ethics for machines, for “ethical machines”, for machines as sub-
jects, rather than for the human use of machines as objects”. Asimov (1942) 
states that machine ethics should be based on rules and, therefore, proposed 
the “three laws of robotics”:
	•	 First Law – A robot may not injure a human being or, through inac-
tion, allow a human being to come to harm.
	•	 Second Law – A robot must obey the orders given to it by human 
beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
	•	 Third Law – A robot must protect its existence as long as such protec-
tion does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
O’grady and O’hare (2012) state that AI-based robots will become the 
future residents of smart cities. Accordingly, it has been started to discuss 
how machine ethics will act within the framework of morality. One of the 
fundamental questions raised in this direction is, “Can a machine behave 
ethically towards other machines and humans?”, if yes, “What are the moral 
standards to be applied to judge machine behaviour?”. For example, should 
an autonomous vehicle sacrifice the person in the car instead of hitting some-
one in a situation where an accident is inevitable? How will he determine 
his choice? At this point, the car’s algorithm, instead of the human being, 
takes place in the decision-maker situation. Currently, the legal grounds do 
not fully answer this problem. The constant set of values brought by design 
leads to an ethical dilemma for autonomous vehicles (Schoettle and Sivak, 
2014).
In a Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2019, half of the respondents 
interviewed agreed that they would not use automated vehicles, while only 
2% of them mentioned that they would buy one immediately. Similarly, Dr. 
Skogsmos and colleagues surveyed 7,000 people across seven countries and 
found that people still trust human drivers more than automated vehicles 
(Burke, 2021). The ethical sensitivity and moral capabilities of these systems 
need to be further developed. However, considering that emotional issues 
such as empathy and care are also an integral part of the ethical decision-
making process, the process becomes even more complex (Pavaloui and 
Kose, 2017). For instance, a robot bound by Asimov’s first law would not 
make decisions if the older person it was caring for refused to take the drugs 
(Wallach, 2014). Unfortunately, the current ethical guidelines do not answer 
the questions mentioned above and ethical questions regarding autonomous 
vehicles (Hagendorff, 2020).

Ethical rules  239
11.7 ANALYTICAL APPROACHES TO ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
It can be challenging to conclude the right-wrong dilemma since the smart 
technologies applied in the world are the same, but different cultures 
make a difference in moral values. With the rapid development of AI, ethi-
cal issues are becoming increasingly complex beyond consensus (Russell 
and Norvig, 2010). The new industrial revolution is expected to bring an 
egalitarian perspective to human values and focus on giving morality to 
machines. To achieve this, machine values are expected to be compatible 
with human goals. In this context, various suggestions can be made. It 
is possible to explain analytical approaches to ethical considerations as 
follows:
	
a.	Creating policies and regulatory frameworks by engaging multiple 
stakeholders
Instead of benefiting a small number of individuals, AI should be struc-
tured with inclusive legislation and regulations for the benefit of all human-
kind. To achieve this, initiatives were accelerated at the UNESCO General 
Conference held on November 24, 2021. The “Recommendation on the 
Ethics of Artificial Intelligence” was adopted with the partnership of many 
stakeholders to set global standards (UNESCO, 2021).
We might note that policies and standards in which the general frame-
work is drawn are not universally accepted because all societies contain 
different elements. However, these initiatives mainly involve an EU and the 
United States perspective. It is expected that the East and the West, or devel-
oped and developing countries, have different goals and objectives regard-
ing AI ethics. Hand (2018) illustrates this with the United Kingdom adhering 
more strictly to ethical considerations regarding data collection and usage 
than other countries. He adds that waiting for everyone to adhere to univer-
sal laws precisely can cause an “ethical drag”, leading to a lack of agility in 
the face of developing technologies.
Smart technological systems should also cooperate with countries with 
different cultural norms, such as the Middle East, to diversify and enrich 
their ethical discourse (Clever et al., 2018). For instance, the city of Dubai 
has been taking quick steps in the process of transforming into a smart city, 
perhaps prioritising many cities. Thus, it has been the world’s first city where 
data sharing is mandated by law (www.digitaldubai.ae/). Therefore, collec-
tive ethical decision-making should be followed to eliminate these 
concerns.
	
b.	Integration of ethical decision mechanisms into the system
There are two basic approaches to integrating ethical decision mechanisms 
into intelligent systems. The first is to include the solution to AI scenarios 
in the design. The second approach aims to teach machines proper moral 

240  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
behaviour. Three basic models can be mentioned in the solution of ethical 
problems in AI applications as follows (Wallach and Allen, 2009):
	•	 Top-Down Model: Basically, all necessary ethical rule sets are expected 
to be uploaded to the AI application in the top-down model. The 
application must comply with these rules in its actions. However, one 
of the most fundamental problems of the model is that ethical rule sets 
are general and cannot be detailed to include all kinds of activities.
	•	 Bottom-Up Model: In the bottom-up model, AI applications are 
expected to learn the ethical rules from their experiences instead of 
given rules and decide based on this learning. However, the undesir-
able consequences that may be experienced during the learning pro-
cesses make this approach not applicable. For example, it can cause 
problems if a robot, which acts by its own rules, develops a moral 
behaviour separate from humans (Pavaloui and Kose, 2017).
	•	 Hybrid Model: The hybrid model proposes the use of a model that 
makes use of both models. Therefore, ethical rule sets will be installed 
on AI applications, and the machine learning process will be activated.
Another way of integrating ethics into smart city technologies is adopting 
data privacy at the design stage. Assuming that all technologies contain ethi-
cal rules, confidentiality should be considered a default obligation at the 
design stage, rather than just obtaining the person’s consent. According to 
Caboukian (2009), the principle of privacy by design includes elements such 
as:
	•	 being proactive,
	•	 automatic protection by default setting,
	•	 privacy embedded into the design as a core feature,
	•	 full functionality with all legitimate interests in mind,
	•	 complete lifecycle protection,
	•	 visibility and transparency,
	•	 and user-centric data.
Noothigattu et al. (2018) suggest that for AI systems to make ethical deci-
sions, their preferences regarding different outcomes should be submitted to 
a system based on human voting. It is argued that this will contribute to the 
explainability properties of the systems. Cassell (2016), on the other hand, 
proposes the human-machine mirroring system. Accordingly, intelligent sys-
tems will develop ethical behaviours based on the people they interact with. 
Discussions on both design and post-design processes are still ongoing. As a 
result, considering all of them as a whole, it will be possible for AI systems 
used in smart cities to collect and process data in a trustworthy and bias-free 
manner.

Ethical rules  241
	
c.	Security and privacy measurement techniques
Various metrics can be considered regarding the ethical behaviour and reli-
ability of AI systems. Thus, instead of reacting after data breaches occur, 
a proactive attitude will be taken beforehand, and data will be protected 
throughout the entire life cycle (Al-Turjman et al., 2019). For example, The 
EU’s Article (WP29) has established a Data Protection Impact Assessment 
(DPIA) with the aim of protecting data in accordance with regulations and 
minimising high-risk situations. It reveals in which situations DPIA should be 
used within the given scenarios. It is mandatory to use this in scenarios that 
are determined to be high risk affecting the personal rights of individuals.
For example, due to patients’ genetic and health data in hospitals, risk situ-
ations include sensitive and personal data or data that are processed on 
a large scale. Among the categories considered high risk are the follow-
ing: large-scale processing of private category or criminal data, large-scale 
public monitoring, and where the profile of the data subject is identified, 
which has a significant impact on the subject (European Commission, 
2021). For larger city projects, it is recommended to develop scales such 
as Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment or Equality Impact Assessment 
to protect AI-based data with the participation of all relevant stakeholders 
(Graham, 2020).
While metrics mediate system design and before data is put into practice, 
it is crucial to protect confidentiality in data processing and transfer pro-
cesses. Within the smart city infrastructure, it is expected to have a solid 
infrastructure that will connect all the components of the city. Real-time big 
data applications should efficiently store and transfer citizens’ information 
with the quality network hardware they offer. This network should effi-
ciently convey data collected from its sources to where big data is collected, 
stored and processed, and report the responses back to the different entities 
in the smart city that require them (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2015). There are sev-
eral implementation techniques for setting privacy as a default of AI such as 
(Graham, 2020):
	•	 Data minimisation measure – instead of collecting all the data, only 
the suitable ones for the purpose are selected
	•	 Purpose limitation measure – sorting into clusters according to the 
purposes for which they were collected
	•	 Security measure – anonymising data or providing control by giving 
pseudonyms
Initiatives to prevent data leakage and affect data sharing to untrusted third 
parties are increasing rapidly. For example, PiOS application has been devel-
oped to detect possible data privacy violations in iOS applications. In this 
way, the data is transferred to the shared pool before being transmitted to 
third parties, and the data flow is controlled by requesting the verification 

242  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
code (Egele et al., 2011). As a result, quality of service support in the net-
work is vital for real-time big data applications for smart cities.
	
d.	Developing trust through education and training
An essential element of building trust is the ability of AI technology to 
reduce security breaches and provide transparent information about the 
process. In this context, AI developers and governments trace the path of 
the open data policy. This also gives information about which ethical val-
ues the software includes. Instead of teaching AIs how to behave ethically, 
enabling individuals to behave ethically can also be brought as a solution. 
For example, Google developed TensorFlow, an open-source machine learn-
ing library, to facilitate AI adoption.
Similarly, the AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit developed by IBM pro-
vides an environment for helping researchers benchmark the fairness of 
algorithms and sharing their ideas (Bellamy et al., 2019). The dissemination 
of such applications will help individuals develop their AI applications with 
a fair perspective away from discrimination. In addition, informing and edu-
cating citizens about the problems that may be encountered within the scope 
of the smart city and their participation in the first decisions will also make 
a positive contribution to the protection of data.
	
e.	Governmental solutions
AI technologies are expected to act agile in the face of changing external 
environments and uncertainties. Likewise, governments should be able to 
update their ethical policies and take proactive decisions by keeping up with 
the speed of technology. In this way, both public waste will be prevented, 
and the security concerns of individuals will be reduced. Smart city advisory 
boards, ethics committees, security teams and emergency response teams 
can be established. For example, the Smart London Board was created by 
experts selected from academia, business and entrepreneurs. Similarly, the 
Privacy Advisory Committee was established in Seattle to ensure smart cit-
ies’ privacy. Therefore, cities can develop strategic visions within the boards 
and integrate them into legal parameters.
11.8  FUTURE EXPECTATIONS
The convenience and accessibility of modern technology significantly con-
tribute to providing a better “experience” to citizens. It is possible to see that 
AI applications are spread over almost all areas. The city of Houston, for 
example, is planning the expansion of robot cops to deter criminals. These 
robots are also aimed to reduce conflicts between the public and the police 
(Begley, 2020). The Las Vegas Health Department, in partnership with the 
University of Rochester, developed the nEmesis app to identify restaurants 
eligible for inspection via tweets about food poisoning. With this applica-
tion based on machine learning, the process was improved by 64% com-
pared to random inspection (National Science Foundation, 2016).

However, there are also some smart city projects and elements that also 
need attention. Quayside is a project that came out with the slogan “A 
Neighbourhood from the Internet” and plans to establish a smart city from 
scratch. An area north of Toronto where it meets Lake Ontario is defined as 
an underutilised and contaminated place. Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs set out 
in 2017, intending to transform this area into one of the most innovative 
urban neighbourhoods in the world. The area is planned to be a smart place 
where driverless shuttles will replace cars, traffic lights will follow the flow 
of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, robots will transport mail and garbage 
through underground tunnels, and mobile buildings will open up new spaces 
(www.toronto.ca).
Did everything go as perfectly as planned? In fact, from the beginning of 
the project, there were concerns about using AI and big data. Ann Cavoukian, 
who withdrew from the project’s consultancy due to privacy concerns, 
established the Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum, and criticism started 
within the framework of #BlockSidewalk. Plans by Sidewalk Labs to build 
an IoT-based “smart city” in Toronto have faced backlash from local author-
ities and citizens over the lack of clear ethical standards for how the data 
obtained will be handled. Ultimately, the company scrapped the project with 
two years lost and $50 million in losses (Kitchin, 2016).
It is possible to multiply examples of ethical concerns regarding data pri-
vacy. In the construction of future smart cities, it is essential to take strategic 
steps today to reduce the risks of using data and the development of AI 
technologies. In recent years, steps have been taken on AI and the privacy of 
data, and solutions to problems are sought reasonably. It is indisputable that 
if appropriate steps are taken to address these concerns, they will play a 
significant role in contributing to the development of cities (Rainie et al., 
2021).
11.9  CONCLUSION
By 2022, AI is predicted to generate $4 trillion for the global economy 
(UNESCO, 2020). Like any new technology, the AI ecosystem provides 
advantages and risks together. Several advantages can be listed as improving 
the health system (cancer diagnosis, disease prediction, support for elder), 
ease of transportation with autonomous vehicles, creating new business 
lines, providing environmental solutions (zero footprints, climate change), 
sustainable agriculture, digital transformation and security for cities and 
residents. Additionally, it provides support to companies in several ways, 
such as product development, cost reduction and transportation. However, 
in order for AI to provide advantages, it needs big data and machine learn-
ing. At this point, concerns have been raised about these issues. For instance, 
AI may be collected for malicious purposes, violation or loss of their per-
sonal data, discrimination, or data biases. Famous technology entrepreneurs

also argue that it can be more dangerous than nuclear weapons if data is 
not controlled.
It becomes necessary to establish teams and supervisory boards to reduce 
risk and take proactive solutions at the macro- and micro-levels. Considering 
that regulation will be much more costly as risks arise, it is necessary to 
identify strategic visions and basic principles by identifying problems in 
advance. It is crucial to both catch up with the speed of technology in the 
international arena and create policies for AI’s privacy concerns by bringing 
together all stakeholders in the national sense.
In addition to legal regulations or AI systems, individuals need to be 
informed about data privacy and ethical issues and raise awareness. 
Although AI-based systems are blamed for ethical concerns, the main prob-
lem stems from the prejudices and belief systems that society stereotypes. It 
should not be forgotten that algorithms create ethical values in line with 
big-data patterns. Therefore, government administrators, companies, tech-
nology developers and citizens should be informed about the ethical issues 
and should receive training in this direction early. This will also contribute 
to the development of responsible AI.
Today, AI mainly serves wealthy countries due to its high budget. 
Developing countries should participate in the competitive race by adapting 
their ethical principles to their geographies and under the leadership of 
countries that have come a long way in data security. As technology contin-
ues to dominate our lives day by day, it is evident that cities and destinations 
that succeed at being “smart” will be one step ahead. AI-based cities of 
tomorrow will continue to develop and grow in line with the foundations 
laid today. Smart cities will provide a better life for millions of people, rather 
than a dystopian future, if ethical issues are given due importance and ideas 
that will benefit humanity are acted upon.

12.1  INTRODUCTION
With the socioeconomic transformation, people prefer to live in the city 
instead of living in the countryside. This situation causes a serious increase 
in the population of the cities. According to estimates, the ratio of people 
living in cities to people living in rural areas will increase to 60% in 2030 
(United Nations, 2016). This rate will increase to 68% in 2050 (Ritchie and 
Roser, 2022) and to 75% in 2075 (Smith, 2012). While at the turn of the 
20th century, 371 cities had a population of over 1 million, this figure rose 
to 548 in 2018 (United Nations, 2021). Cities have to undergo some admin-
istrative changes with the effect of the increasing population. The support 
of technology makes cities into smart cities. Smart cities are structures built 
with the IoT, big data, mobile internet, cloud computing, sensors, smart 
transportation vehicles, and similar technologies.
Smart cities are huge systems that are complex and made up of many 
components. Therefore, smart cities contain various technical problems and 
difficulties. Information and data security are among the most critical issues 
besides factors such as funding needs, cooperation needs, and interfaces that 
need to be constantly improved.
Ensuring information and data security in smart cities means protecting 
data, information, hardware, and network from all kinds of attacks and 
malicious activities. However, smart cities have unique challenges that dis-
tinguish their security systems from other data security structures. Security 
problems in smart cities should be solved instantly. The continuation of life 
is sometimes possible with the solution to this problem. For example, in 
Ukraine in December 2015, attackers hacked the control of the electricity 
grid’s controller and data collection system through software called 
BlackEnergy. This attack left more than 700,000 people without electricity 
for several hours (Case, 2016). Security concerns in smart cities are not just

due to attacks. Problems such as system failures and unauthorised access are 
also evaluated. People’s concerns about smart cities are shown in Table 12.1 
by Lytras and Visvizi in 2018.
As shown in Table 12.1, the biggest part of people’s concerns about smart 
cities is related to security and protection. In this study, the security problems 
of smart cities are discussed in different aspects. In the first part, the issue of 
security is examined in general terms. In the second part, the issue of security 
in smart cities is discussed from the perspective of IoT. In the third part, appli-
cations and security problems in smart cities are mentioned. In the fourth part, 
some important concepts and security in smart cities are evaluated. In the last 
part, measures to be taken for security problems in smart cities are given.
12.2 THE CONCEPT OF DATA AND INFORMATION 
SECURITY IN SMART CITIES
Smart cities are formed by the combination of many elements. These ele-
ments are heterogeneous in terms of their structure and functions, and they 
need various protocols for their communication. Data is obtained from vari-
ous points and transmitted to the server by different methods. At this stage, 
the security of the data flow is very important. This security needs to be 
evaluated and handled with the concepts of information security.
Data can be defined as irregular or unorganised measurements, facts, fig-
ures, and observations (Gordon and Gordon, 1999). Data is raw and it has 
no meaning on its own (Krishnan, 2013). There is a process of transforming 
data into a meaningful structure, that is, information. This is called the 
DIKW (data, information, knowledge, and wisdom) hierarchy. Knowledge 
is a mixture of experience, value, and expert opinion that provides perspec-
tive to understand new experiences (Davenport and Prusak, 1998).
Information security is the measures taken against unauthorized access, 
use, disclosure, interruption, modification, or destruction of information 
and information systems (Sattarova Feruza and Kim, 2007). Information 
security has three key elements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In 
short, they are defined as confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA).
Confidentiality is the ability to prevent anyone who is not authorised to 
read or change the information from accessing, using or changing the 
information.
Integrity is the prevention of unauthorised or unintentional modification 
of even a small part of information. It means keeping the information as it 
should be. Adding new data to the information, changing it, or deleting all 
or part of it destroys the integrity of the data.
Data availability means that information is accessible to authorised users 
whenever they’re needed. Availability measures protect timely and uninter-
rupted access to the system when they need it under any circumstances, 
including power outages or natural disasters. Similar to confidentiality and 
integrity, availability also is very important.

256  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
Apart from these three elements, there are also elements such as non-
repudiation, reliability–consistency, identification, authentication, authori-
zation, auditing and accountability.
Although apart from the CIA, the authentication element is also an impor-
tant element for smart cities. Authentication is the determination of users’ 
access rights and limits. In a complex structure such as smart cities, user 
authentication comes to the fore. It is necessary to give priority to the stud-
ies carried out.
Some strategies for data protection can be listed as follows (IBM, 2022):
	•	 Ensuring the physical security of user devices and servers
	•	 Application security and updates
	•	 Data access management and control
	•	 Encryption in data exchange
	•	 Restricting data to the extent of authority
	•	 Monitoring and controlling network and endpoint security
	•	 Making copies of data so that it can be recovered in an unexpected 
situation
	•	 User and employee training.
12.3  SECURITY IN SMART CITIES FROM AN IOT 
PERSPECTIVE
IoT devices have the largest share in the construction and management of 
smart cities. Almost all operations are carried out through these devices. It 
is normal for the number of IoT devices to increase with the use of other 
fields. The number of IoT-connected devices worldwide is expected to reach 
30.9 billion units by 2025, a sharp increase from 13.8 billion units in 2021 
(Statista, 2021). The security of IoT devices, which have widespread use, is 
also extremely important. OWASP listed the points to be considered in the 
process of creating, deploying, and managing IoT devices in 2018 as follows 
(OWASP, 2018):
	
1.	Weak, guessable, or hardcoded passwords
	
2.	Insecure network services
	
3.	Insecure ecosystem interfaces
	
4.	Lack of secure update mechanism
	
5.	Use of insecure or outdated components
	
6.	Insufficient privacy protection
	
7.	Insecure data transfer and storage
	
8.	Lack of device management
	
9.	Insecure default settings
	 10.	Lack of physical hardening.

Data security  257
IoT devices can be considered in many layers in terms of structure. In this 
section, the layers that make up IoT devices and the evaluation of these 
layers in terms of security are included. The layers that make up the IoT 
devices are given in different numbers in different sources. For example, Wu 
et al. (2010) approved the 3-layer structure and Khan et al. (2012) approved 
the 5-layer structure. In this study, the 4-layer structure in Figure 12.1 is 
discussed.
12.3.1  Perpection (sensing) layer
The (perpection) sensing layer is also called the recognition layer. It is the 
lowest layer of the architecture. It can be said that it is a physical layer 
because it consists of many heterogeneous devices. This layer works like 
a human’s sense organs. Like the functions of a sense organ, it undertakes 
the task of identifying and collecting information. The sensing layer con-
sists of smart sensors (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, pollution, 
air pressure, vibration, etc.), GPS (Global Positioning System) devices, 
wearable sensing devices, RFID readers, actuators, heterogeneous devices, 
WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), and local wireless connections (Wi-Fi,

Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.). The sensing layer collects data from these structures 
and transmits the obtained data to the network layer for further processing 
(Al Hinai and Singh, 2017). In this sense, it can be said that the sensing layer 
is an important big data production and transfer centre.
This layer is the most physically accessible and concerning layer in terms 
of security. With its distributed organizational structure, the sensing layer 
can be easily accessed by attackers due to the static deployment of many 
nodes. It is open to a variety of threats, including physical interference (Kotis 
and Katasonov, 2013). Attackers can plan an attack via RFID (Radio-
Frequency Identification) tag, Zigbee, and Bluetooth. The heterogeneous 
structure of the data also creates another challenge for control. But the big-
gest point of attack is the sensors. It is difficult to maintain the confidential-
ity of sensor data, as attackers can physically place their sensors close to the 
device and detect the same values (Mayer, 2009).
Many security issues are identified in this layer:
Tampering: This security issue is also known as poisoning (Ahmed et al., 
2021). In this type of attack, attackers physically attack. The attacker’s 
goal is to gain access to the internal circuitry of the cryptographic sys-
tem. The aim is to directly interfere with the hardware and software of 
the device. The attacker can obtain some equipment by chemical and 
mechanical methods. Electromagnetic scanning is also possible.
It can be said that attackers have two goals: gaining information and 
creating errors. As a result of this attack, the software of the device can 
be replaced with another spyware. This attack from one point can affect 
the entire network.
Physical measures can be taken to prevent this attack. Sensors can be 
hidden by placing them in a hard-to-find and hard-to-see location. Code 
structures and data inside the device can be encrypted. By creating emer-
gency situations, measures such as disconnecting from the network and 
deleting the software can be taken if necessary. The status of each device 
can be taken under control by creating a central management system.
Replay Attack: In a replay attack, the attacker eavesdrops on a secure com-
munication network. In this way, it captures data and then maliciously 
delays or retransmits it, misleading the system to do what it wants (El 
Abbadi and Jamouli, 2021).
The reason why this attack is dangerous: The attacker proves his iden-
tity and authenticity with the information he obtains and sends the veri-
fied encrypted information to the user. As a result, the receiver cannot 
understand that it is an attack and considers it a correct request (Puthal 
et al., 2016; Rughoobur and Nagowah, 2017).
On the other hand, recorded transmissions are repeated over and over 
on the network, preventing the system from going into sleep mode. Thus, 
devices continue to exchange information and consume a lot of energy 
(Pawar et al., 2012).

Data security  259
Timing Attack: It is an attack against devices that generally have weak com-
puting capacity and computational capabilities. It allows the attacker 
to discover vulnerabilities by observing the response times of queries or 
cryptographic algorithms. The attacker learns the secrets of the system 
(Conti et al., 2016). The attack is based on the assumption that each 
transaction has a certain amount of time to execute. In this attack type, 
the attacker sends random data to the target and it controls the target’s 
decryption time. The attacker tries to extract the text or even the encryp-
tion key sent this way. This type of attack is usually carried out in public-
key cryptography (Want, 2006).
As a precaution against this attack, authentication may be requested 
before each transaction or randomly selected transactions.
Eavesdropping: If there is no secure communication between the sender and 
the receiver, it can be difficult to ensure the integrity of the data. Data 
may be interrupted or manipulated during transmission to the receiver. 
This situation may cause the senders to send their requests incorrectly or 
the receivers to record the information incorrectly (Pardeshi and Borade, 
2015).
Attackers often carry out attacks against communication tools (phone 
calls, text messages, video conferences, etc.) in real time (Hoang et al., 
2019). They look for unsecured transmission paths to access sent and 
received information.
This type of attack is dangerous. The attacker can record the informa-
tion flowing through the infrastructure through the vulnerability he has 
caught.
The precaution to be taken against this attack is possible by making 
the communication secure. Encrypting data in transit and changing en-
cryption algorithms frequently can be an important precaution.
Node Capture: It is one of the attacks that can pose serious dangers in 
the sensing layer. In this attack, the attacker gains full control over any 
key node. As a result of the attack, the attacker can obtain the infor-
mation stored on the node, the communication between the sender 
and the receiver, and a key used to provide secure communication 
(Bharathi et al., 2012). This attack, which can cause a serious impact 
on the network, is also known as a node replication attack (Lin et al., 
2017a).
Fake Node and Malicious: It is a type of attack where the attacker injects a 
new device or node into the system and then enters fake and malicious 
data through this node. Its purpose is to stop the flow of real information 
and replace it with malicious transmissions. The newly added node by the 
attacker consumes the energy of the real nodes and the destruction of the 
network may occur.
In order to prevent this type of attack, it is important to send en-
crypted data and perform authentication. Before sending any data, 

260  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
the two devices must exchange an authenticated key. However, it is 
normal for these security processes to have extra burdens on the sys-
tem. In this sense, it is necessary to consider resource consumption and 
performance.
12.3.2  Network layer
The network layer is also called the transmission layer (Burhan et al., 
2018). Through this layer, the data collected in the sensing layer is safely 
transferred to the upper layer (Lakshmi and Srikanth, 2018; Kraijak and 
Tuwanut, 2015). This layer provides data collection from different sensors. 
In addition, it provides the necessary communication infrastructure for the 
transport of data (Filipponi et al., 2010). Communication is established 
between the perpection layer and the application layer through this layer. 
Data collected from physical objects can be transmitted via wired and wire-
less networks (Al Hinai and Singh, 2017).
The network layer provides a reliable information exchange with the 
sensing layer. It also takes part in keeping the first records of the incoming 
information and in the classification and polymerization of the information. 
The task of information transmission in this layer is with various technolo-
gies such as internet, mobile communication network, satellite networks, 
wireless network, and communication protocols.
The network layer is vulnerable to attacks as it acts as a link between 
devices and other network components (Ceron et al., 2019). At this layer, it 
is foreseen that attacks will cause situations such as inactivating or misdi-
recting network traffic. Common attacks at the network layer: distributed 
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack, dam-
age to privacy and integrity, wormhole attack, unauthorized access to the 
network, eavesdropping, and insertion of malware (Lakshmi and Srikanth, 
2018).
Authentication at this layer is required to secure the network. However, 
the confidentiality and integrity of the data are equally important. Extra 
precautions are required for common DoS attacks.
Wiretapping: It is the attacker’s listening to information packets on the 
network to obtain confidential data or authentication information (Lee 
et al., 2019).
Denial of Service (DoS): DoS is the easiest and most common attack in 
this layer (Tabassum et al., 2019). In DoS attacks, the goal is to ensure 
that users who have permission to access do not access devices or other 
network resources. It is a type of attack in which the attacker fills the 
network with too much traffic and prevents the network from being 
used properly (Mukaddam et al., 2014; Prabhakar, 2017). IoT devices 
can be easily affected by Dos attacks due to lack of memory and energy 

Data security  261
consumption (Prabhakar, 2017). DoS attacks affect the availability of 
systems or connections. In some cases, the attacker can directly attack 
physical devices with appropriate hardware and techniques. This situ-
ation disables the device and affects the continuity of the system. This 
attack can also be made to the cloud or the gateway. These attacks are 
mostly caused by a lack of network computing equipment and capabili-
ties.
Storage Attack: System information is stored on storage devices or in the 
cloud. In this type of attack, the attacker can attack storage devices or 
the cloud. During this attack, information can be destroyed or changed.
Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attack: In MiTM attacks, the attacker inter-
feres with the communication between two devices. It is a type of attack 
in which the attacker secretly transfers, blocks, and modifies data. By 
hijacking communication, the attacker can maliciously alter the exchange 
of information between devices. This attack poses a serious threat to 
online security because it is real-time and the attacker can change infor-
mation instantly (Conti et al., 2016).
12.3.3  Support layer
This layer, which is not included in the three-layer structure, is a reliable 
support platform in the four-layer structure. It acts as a shield of protec-
tion between the network layer and the application layer. It is the layer cre-
ated to reduce the security pressure on the network layer. This layer is also 
responsible for transmitting information to the network layer (Ashouri et 
al., 2018). It receives the data from the network layer and performs the nec-
essary security operations (authentication, data encryption) and transfers 
it to the application layer. Some researchers also do not include this layer 
due to its proximity to the application layer (Qian and Zhang, 2010). The 
support layer needs many application security architectures such as cloud 
computing, secure multilateral computing, strong encryption algorithms, 
encryption protocol, and anti-virus.
Threats in the support layer are discussed below:
Denial of Service (DoS): DoS attacks at the support layer are linked to the 
network layer. As discussed in the previous section, the attacker blocks 
network traffic with high demand. By running out of resources, it does 
not allow the system to run.
Malicious Insider Attack: It is performed within the system by an authorized 
user. It is usually for the purpose of obtaining the information of another 
user. It is a complex and difficult attack to solve, since the attack is from 
within. Keeping transaction logs can enable retrospective examination of 
transactions and detection of problematic transactions.

262  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
12.3.4 Application layer
The application layer is the last and top layer of the system. It is the layer 
responsible for the operation of applications belonging to smart cities. This 
layer also undertakes the tasks of formatting and presenting the data. This 
layer serves applications (Sun and Ansari, 2017). It improves city perfor-
mance through multiple applications using stored and processed data. It 
is customizable according to the needs of the users. Users can join the sys-
tem through this layer with various interfaces. This layer also includes fac-
tors such as microservices and development environment (SDKs – software 
development kit, language, portability) (McClellan, 2019). The performance 
of the application layer affects the performance of the entire smart city. It 
directly affects the user’s approach to the smart city and their satisfaction. 
Users are not interested in other layers of the established system. A problem 
that arises at the application layer takes precedence over smart city ideas.
The application layer raises some security concerns in smart cities as it is 
end-user-oriented and easy to access systems. Attackers easily find vulnera-
bilities of applications as they can test systems due to the ease of access. Two 
different structures are needed to solve the security problems of the applica-
tion layer; authentication and key agreement, the other one is the protection 
of the user’s privacy. In addition, in terms of information security, it is very 
important for users to be aware of password management and for the man-
agement to take measures in this regard (Meng and WU, 2011). It is difficult 
to verify authentication and data confidentiality for applications with het-
erogeneous different authentication mechanisms.
This section lists some security concerns at the application layer:
12.3.4.1  Cross-site scripting
An XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack is a client-side code injection attack. 
The attack happens by inserting malicious JavaScript code into a legitimate 
web application that users can access. An attack occurs when another user 
runs this script. Systems with input elements are the most common target 
of this attack. With this operation, the attacker can manipulate or illegally 
possess the data (Gupta and Gupta, 2017). The attack takes place entirely 
on the client-side, not on the server.
As a precaution against this attack, all users’ input must be filtered and 
extracted. It can also be effective to limit the user’s repeated use of the 
system.
12.3.4.2  Structured query language injection attack
In this type of attack, the attacker targets the database. The attack is carried 
out on the application side in data entry or parameter sending. The attacker 
can access the database, view, change or delete the information with the 
piece of code they add.

Data security  263
The precaution to be taken against this attack is to control the data inputs 
or parameter transmissions during the design and development phase of the 
software. Every text should be checked before it is added to the direct struc-
tured query language query. Some special words or characters should be 
checked. These attacks, which may occur as a result of simple carelessness, 
can cause major problems. But it is also extremely easy to prevent.
12.3.4.3  Malware
It is malicious code inserted into applications in various ways to compro-
mise the privacy, integrity, or availability of applications running on the 
application layer. Structurally, there are different types;
	•	 Trojan horse: A malicious program that hides its main purpose that 
the user is not aware of and is activated by the user’s execution. When 
run, it performs some undesirable functions.
	•	 Viruses/Worms: Viruses or worms are software that spread to the 
operating system and other applications without users being aware 
of it. It spreads to the system due to gaps in security policies in the 
infrastructure. Like its biological counterpart, it reproduces in the 
appropriate environment after finding a place in the human body. 
Since many devices and platforms need to be connected to a common 
network in smart cities, viruses can spread to the system from different 
points. If the necessary precautions are not taken, a virus can spread to 
the whole city from a smart vehicle at any point in the city. Computer 
worms are programs that replicate themselves within a network and 
take advantage of the entire network. It endangers the system due to 
its propagation speed. For example, BrickerBot damaged millions of 
devices in 2017 (Cimpanu, 2017).
	•	 Rootkit: Software used by an attacker to gain control over the server 
or network. It can be single software or multiple software linked to 
each other. These programs usually want to have root access (in the 
role of administrator) or act with administrator privilege. Root access 
provides full control of the system.
The approach to the security problem at the application layer should 
be two-way from the system point of view and the user point of view. 
Authentication and key usage are important in heterogeneous applica-
tion structures. Protecting the user’s own privacy is also very important. 
Necessary administrative measures should be taken and the user’s aware-
ness should be raised.
12.3.4.4  Other Attacks
Apart from the attacks mentioned in the previous section, there are also 
attacks that concern all layers. Ultimately, it is the people who run the 

264  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
smart city system. People can make conscious or unconscious mistakes. 
Unconscious mistakes can be due to a lack of education or carelessness. 
Conscious attacks are no different from an attacker’s attack. It is even 
more dangerous because it is inside the system and is authorized by users. 
These attacks can also be about accessing personal information instead of 
disrupting the structure of the system. Data can be easily extracted and 
changed from the inside on purpose. The precaution to be taken against 
this danger is a strong log structure. If possible, the log should be con-
trolled by artificial intelligence algorithms. Otherwise, audits can be made 
by selecting samples.
12.4 APPLICATIONS IN SMART CITIES
Smart cities use advanced technologies in many areas. Technologies used by 
smart cities can be examined in various dimensions. Different sources have 
made this classification in different ways (Table 12.2).
Besides these approaches, one of the most widely used models is the 
model recommended by the US National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. This model, also called the “system of systems”, can be illus-
trated in Figure 12.2.
12.4.1  Smart environment
Smart environment aims to build a sustainable society for smart cities. Smart 
environment supports the development of technologies in many subjects 
such as energy consumption, urban infrastructure, and waste management. 
A smart city has the ability to monitor energy consumption, air quality, 
and evaluate waste or pollution efficiently with various management tools 
(Zanella et al., 2014). The use of environmental sensor elements is very 
important for these processes.
For example, in Amsterdam, drinking water is passed through the build-
ing and used to cool the buildings. With this method, buildings are cooled 
efficiently without any waste (Ejaz and Anpalagan, 2019)
Smart environment applications in smart cities are serious targets of 
attackers. Especially energy-related attacks create grievances for citizens 
and negatively affect their lives. Here are some sample hacking attempts and 
their consequences:
	•	 In 2015, hackers managed to take control of the electricity grid in Kiev, 
Ukraine, with malware called BlackEnergy. In this attack, more than 
700,000 subscribers had to live without electricity for hours (Case, 
2016).
	•	 In 2017, the electricity distribution company serving in England and 
Ireland was attacked. The aim of the attack was to infiltrate the power 

Data security  265
control systems and disable the electrical grid. The attack was a phish-
ing attack on a fake email sent to senior employees at the company. 
The e-mail also contained some technical information. The aim was to 
get them to click on the link in the mail and in this way trigger mal-
ware (Dearden, 2017).

266  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
12.4.2  Smart governance (government)
Smart governance is concerned with the execution of public services and 
the participation of citizens in decision-making processes in governance sys-
tems. The main purpose of smart governance is to provide better service to 
the citizen or society by connecting the operations of various institutions 
with the information technology infrastructure (Gil-Garcia, 2012).
Smart governance may differ according to the vision of the inhabitants 
and its target audience. However, this concept should definitely include fac-
tors such as a transparent management approach, public and social service 
provision, and management strategies. In particular, the understanding of 
common management and transparency enables the citizen to be involved in 
public decisions and planning (Alawadhi and Scholl, 2016). E-government 
applications are one of the important services of smart government.
Governance and services in smart cities are under constant threat from 
attackers. There are some related cases given below:
	•	 In 2017, the WannaCry cyber-attack was effective in over 70 countries. 
It succeeded in disrupting 34% of the UK’s National Health Service 
(National Audit Office, 2017).
	•	 In 2017, Department of Defense (DOD) testers found critical cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems under development 
(Gregg, 2018).
	•	 In 2019, a ransomware attack on Baltimore, USA, caused all govern-
ment computers to shut down. The attackers demanded 13 Bitcoins 
(about $76,280) in exchange for encrypted and infected files (Fisher, 
2019).
12.4.3  Smart people
Cities are meaningful with the people who live in them. The education level 
of the people living in the smart city and their contribution to the man-
agement and system are important for the development of the city. Smart 
people are evaluated by various factors such as education, innovation, par-
ticipation, and creativity. The continuity and management of the city are 
directly related to these factors. A city with highly creative and innovative 
people has more opportunities for self-development. In light of all this infor-
mation, the key success factor of a city is people’s participation. If people do 
not create and share information together, it is not possible for that smart 
city to be successful (Kogan and Lee, 2014). In addition, not only residents 
but also people who are in that city as guests can be defined as smart people.
One of the biggest targets of attackers is people living in smart cities. 
People are included in the system in smart cities within their needs and per-
missions. If people are not educated or do not take some individual 

Data security  267
precautions, it can endanger the entire smart city. In particular, there are 
situations that require attention, such as password management (weak pass-
word setting, unprotected password, etc.). There are also attacks that affect 
all people living in smart cities:
For example, in an attack in 2016, many users could not access Twitter, 
SoundCloud, Spotify, Shopify, and other websites throughout the day 
(Etherington and Conger, 2016).
12.4.4  Smart living
Improving the quality of life of those living in smart cities is very impor-
tant. Security, health conditions, cultural and touristic facilities, educational 
facilities, quality of housing, and social cohesion are important factors in 
terms of quality of life (Ejaz and Anpalagan, 2019). Smart cities’ attention 
to issues such as reducing CO2 footprints and real-time monitoring ensures 
that these cities are environmentally friendly. The London Plan is authorized 
by the Greater London Authority (GLA). It is a longitudinal development 
plan that aims to improve the quality of life of UK residents. One of the 
important sub-policies of the plan is to reduce the CO2 footprint by 2050 
(Hosseinian-Far et al., 2011).
It is very important to ensure that smart living is not hindered and its 
safety is ensured. to give some examples:

268  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
	•	 In 2017, an attack targeting a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was 
planned. The purpose of the attack was to sabotage the operations of 
the facility. It was even possible for the attack to have consequences 
that could lead to the death of people. The attack failed thanks to a 
bug in the code prepared by the attackers (Kimani et al., 2019).
	•	 In 2016, residents of two apartments in Lappeenranta, eastern Finland, 
had to live in the cold for a weekend. As a result of the DDoS attack 
by the attackers, the environmental control systems stopped working 
(Mathews, 2016).
12.4.5  Smart mobility
One of the most important issues in cities is transportation. People living 
in the city should be able to reach from one point to another in the fast-
est and most efficient way. Smart mobility aims to make transportation 
systems more “smart” with hardware, software, and ideas. Key principles 
of smart mobility are flexibility, efficiency, integration, clean technology, 
and safety (Geotab, 2018). Smart mobility is the ability of vehicles to com-
municate with road networks, mobile devices, traffic control stations, fuel 
stations, hospitals, and hotels to meet the challenges of transportation 
systems (Alam et al., 2016). It also aims to develop greener transporta-
tion methods. Other common applications in smart mobility are driver 
passports, driver’s licence recognition systems, parking lot search, and 
demand forecasting (Vlahogianni et al., 2016). Smart mobility also has an 
important place in preventing accidents. It is expected that the number of 
possible deaths from traffic accidents by 2030 will be 3.54 million. Smart 
mobility systems also help reduce deaths with their services (Alam et al., 
2016).
Another issue in smart mobility is logistics services. In addition to the 
tracking of the vehicle in the logistics sector, the creation of sensors that will 
provide the temperature, odour, and humidity balance for the protection of 
the product during the transportation phase is also the subject of smart 
mobility. It is possible to create instant traceability for both the seller and 
the buyer with smart mobility systems.
One of the biggest focal points of smart cities is urban transportation. 
Smart mobility systems provide citizens with the level of congestion on the 
streets, alternative routes, alternative transportation vehicles, etc. can trans-
mit information instantly. Considering a few examples of smart transporta-
tion systems in the world (Ejaz and Anpalagan, 2019); Seoul has created a 
system where passengers can enjoy the internet in the subway. Barcelona has 
promoted the use of eco-friendly electric vehicles and bicycles for green 
transportation.
Smart mobility systems also provide significant benefits for citizens. 
Citizens can make their lives easier while finding the fastest and most 

Data security  269
­economical way by using various applications for transportation. It also 
provides a significant benefit for visitors coming to the city for the first time.
Safety is critical in intelligent transportation. Cyber-attacks can cause 
serious problems. In an urban transportation network made up of fully 
autonomous vehicles, these attacks can cause life in the city to stop. Incorrect 
or incomplete guidance of drivers can cause accidents. Some examples are as 
follows:
	•	 In August 2003, train signals were interrupted in Jacksonville Florida, 
United States, due to a virus that infected the international transporta-
tion company’s computer systems (Niland, 2003).
	•	 In January 2008, a Polish teenager derailed four tram cars after hack-
ing a train network (Leyden, 2008).
	•	 In March 2010, a high-speed airport express train and freight trains 
were affected by a communication failure in Oslo Norway. Trains lay 
dormant across the country overnight (Berglund, 2010).
	•	 In December 2011, rail signals have been interrupted for two days 
since hackers attacked a computer at an unidentified rail company in 
the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (Ciani, 2012).
	•	 In 2015, attackers knocked a jeep off the road by remotely intercept-
ing it on the highway (Greenberg, 2015).
	•	 In 2017, Deutsche Bahn rail infrastructure in Germany suffered sys-
tem failures due to the widely publicized WannaCry attack (Sapién, 
2017).
	•	 DDoS attacks on the transport network in Sweden in October 2017 
caused train delays and disruption of travel services (Kimani et al., 
2019).
12.4.6  Smart economy
A smart economy can be defined as uninterrupted and stable economic 
growth and employment growth that feeds a city (Mohanty et al., 2016). 
The basis of the smart economy is the incentive for the green economy. 
A  smart economy includes factors such as entrepreneurship, innovation, 
trademarks, the flexibility of the labour market, productivity, and inte-
gration in the international market. Growing cities need smart economic 
­models with their increasing population. It is estimated that by 2030, $40 
trillion will be spent on new urban infrastructure worldwide (Parnell and 
Oldfield, 2014).
Some attacks on Smart Economy are as follows:
	•	 In 2018 Canara Bank ATM servers were hacked. More than 300 users’ 
ATM information and 20 lakh rupees were deleted (Ranjitha, 2021).
	•	 In 2018 1.1 billion people’s card information was leaked (Ranjitha, 
2021).

270  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
12.5  SECURITY MEASURES IN SMART CITIES
Measures to be taken for data and information security in smart cities are a 
great challenge. In this complex system where there are data inputs and out-
puts from many points, significant precautions must be taken for security. 
Measures to be taken in smart cities following items created by making use 
of the “10-Step Cybersecurity Checklist for Smart Cities” prepared by Trend 
Micro are listed below (Lin et al., 2017b):
	•	 Ensuring the security of physical devices
	•	 Ensuring CIA of data
	•	 Ensuring data access controls
	•	 Backing up data and storing it securely in an independent area
	•	 Making user definitions at the right permission level
	•	 Ensuring secure data communication
	•	 Checking the authenticity of data, devices and people in all transactions
	•	 Developing structures that will not completely lose control in the event 
of an attack
	•	 Continuous quality control
	•	 Periodic performance of penetration tests
	•	 Testing the applications and checking the consistency and up-to-date-
ness of the applications
	•	 Prioritise security in SLAs for all vendors and service providers
	•	 To ensure the continuity of the service of smart infrastructures and to 
plan the smart infrastructure cycle by considering the wear and sup-
port services
	•	 Ensuring confidentiality while processing data
	•	 Enabling anonymisation of open data to protect citizen privacy in 
smart cities
	•	 Establishing a Municipal Computer Emergency Response Team 
(CERT) or Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) for 
possible emergencies
	•	 Creation of systems that can manually control fully automatic 
structures
	•	 Encrypt, authenticate, and regulate public communication channels
	•	 Ensuring fault tolerances for the designed system and preventing the 
system from stopping
	•	 Ensuring that applications have alternatives in working conditions
	•	 Implementing end-to-end privacy and security measures
	•	 Creating scenarios where basic services (electricity, water, heating, etc.) 
can continue in possible situations
	•	 Ensuring continuous monitoring of the system against abnormal 
behaviour and data exchanges
	•	 Paying attention to the compliance of security measures with national 
and international laws, using these channels in case of need.

Data security  271
The important issue to be considered about the measures taken in smart 
cities is the performance problem. Over-precaution or incorrect design of 
measures results in performance and cost losses. Considering the continu-
ity of life in smart cities and that it will not be possible to slow down, one 
should be as sensitive as possible in this regard.
12.6  CONCLUSION
The increase in the urban population day by day makes it difficult to man-
age the cities. For efficient city management, technology has started to be 
needed more. These cities, where technology is used in various applications, 
are called smart cities. In fact, what is characterized is that the applications 
made in the city are smart rather than the smartness of a city. Considering 
that technology is developing every day, it can be said that smart cities are 
at the beginning of the road. In smart cities, there is a need for the manage-
ment of large amounts of data. The circulation and recording of this data 
is a major problem. Ensuring the security of data is also a great necessity. 
Some of these data are private and some are general. The security approach 
to this heterogeneous data is different. Due to the increasing data recording 
and circulation in smart cities, people’s security concerns arise.
In this study, security problems and concerns in smart cities are discussed 
through IoT and smart city applications. It has been tried to put forward the 
measures that can be taken for security problems. It is normal that new 
experiences related to security will emerge due to the increasing number of 
smart city applications. The increase in the number of smart cities in the 
future will cause hackers to work harder and develop new algorithms. 
People responsible for the security of smart cities need to develop counter-
measures. The use of artificial intelligence in this area can provide early and 
rapid elimination of some attacks. In the study, security problems and exam-
ples encountered so far are given.
The security problems of smart cities are based on social, cultural, and 
economic reasons as well as technical infrastructure. Attackers and attacks 
should be evaluated from this point of view and studies should be carried 
out on these issues. Precautions to be taken against possible attacks in smart 
cities are very important. Short, medium, and long-term actions should be 
planned in case of attacks and their documentation should be provided. 
Necessary legal regulations and training should be given to citizens. Efforts 
should be made to ensure that there is no disruption in services at the time 
of the attack.
The measures taken for the security problems of smart cities need to be 
carefully designed. Operations made in the name of security should not 
cause performance losses. Otherwise, problems may arise in terms of both 
cost and citizen satisfaction.

272  Artificial Intelligence Perspective for Smart Cities
In future studies, a defence model can be put forward by considering the 
current situation and the future situation. This defence model can be 
enriched with artificial intelligence technologies. There can also be a check-
list within smart city applications.
