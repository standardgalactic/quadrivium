ncreasingly, individual investors have access to a wide variety of 
investment opportunities and a rich array of information about such 
opportunities. Much of this information is quantitative, providing either 
metrics based on mathematical models from financial economics or the 
raw data with which investors can conduct their own analysis. This course 
examines the analytical aspects of investing to allow you to produce and/
or translate quantitative information so that you can create an effective 
investment strategy. 
Because the material is analytical, the course does not shy away from 
quantitative methods. However, the goal of the course is to create an 
intuitive understanding of the underpinnings, justification, and the strategic 
role of each analytical method. Whether you intend to manage your own 
investments or delegate the management of your wealth to professionals, it 
is critically important to have such an understanding. 
Effective investing is a 5-step process. Step 1 is to define a set of investment 
objectives. Step 2 is to collect and analyze information on the variety of 
investment opportunities available in the market. Step 3 is to react to the 
output of step 2 to develop and implement an investment strategy that aligns 
with the investment objectives. Step 4 is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
steps 2 and 3 relative to the objectives. Step 5 is to revise steps 2 and 3 based 
on the feedback from step 4—and so on. That is, effective investing is a 
continual process of defining, analyzing, reacting, evaluating, and revising. 
The goal of this course is to provide you with a systematic and quantitative 
approach to each of these steps. 
The examination of step 1 begins with Lecture 1, which delineates the 
investment goals investors might have. Lecture 2 then develops a framework 
for investing that combines passive investing (investing in index funds 
designed to “be” the market) with active strategies (actively seeking to

“beat” the market). This framework lets you pick how active to be, given 
the demands on your time and the return from active investing. Given this 
context, Lecture 3 examines the evidence from psychology that humans make 
systematic cognitive mistakes when processing and reacting to information. 
This lecture warns that these mistakes negatively impact the efficacy of 
active investment strategies. You will also learn about the efficient market 
hypothesis (lectures 5 and 6), which states that market prices accurately 
reflect information. The goal of these lectures is to examine whether active 
investing is profitable. The evidence is mixed. 
The analysis of step 2 begins with Lecture 7, which develops time value 
of money concepts and formulas, the building blocks of security valuation. 
Using these techniques, the course examines pricing and the sources of 
variability in returns for stocks and bonds. For bonds, the course examines 
pricing (Lecture 8), why bond yields vary with time to maturity (Lecture 9), 
and bond risk (including interest rate risk and credit risk metrics in lectures 
10 and 11). For stocks, the course examines how value is created in firms 
and how that value translates into stock returns and risk (lectures 12 and 13). 
For step 3 (optimal reaction), lectures 15 and 16 examine how to quantify 
the behavior of security returns and how to combine securities in portfolios 
to control risk while achieving investment portfolio growth. These lectures 
provide a baseline portfolio approach to investing; no particular view on 
active versus passive investing is taken. However, these lectures highlight 
one of the most important concepts of the course—namely that the efficacy 
of any particular investment must be assessed by considering its contribution 
to risk and return in an optimally formed investment portfolio. Using this 
insight, Lecture 17 develops the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the 
most commonly used equilibrium asset pricing model. The CAPM justifies 
the market “beta” as the appropriate measure of risk for any security; it also 
specifies how efficient (or fair) prices of securities should vary with beta. 
In doing so, the CAPM provides a useful benchmark for active portfolio 
management; by specifying when a security’s price is “just right,” it specifies 
when a security is mispriced. Lecture 18 examines how to exploit mispriced 
securities; lectures 20–23 analyze financial options and show how they can 
be used to speculate or hedge risks. 

3
Step 4 in the investment process (evaluation) is considered in Lecture 19, 
where a variety of commonly used performance metrics are examined. 
Because the best metric for evaluating a portfolio depends on the portfolio’s 
role in the investor’s overall investment strategy, a variety of potential roles 
and the appropriate metrics for each role are considered.
Consistent with step 5 (revision), the final lecture revisits the debate about 
active versus passive management in the context of empirical evidence 
counter to CAPM; this lecture explores multi-factor models that have been 
developed as alternatives to CAPM. ■

Lecture 1: Investment Decisions and Goals
Investment Decisions and Goals
Lecture 1
T
here are two main goals for this course. The first goal is for you 
to become an informed consumer of the plethora of investment 
information out there. The second goal is for you to be able to 
identify the pros and cons of a specific investment approach and then make 
a conscious choice based on a full understanding of the trade-off between 
alternatives. In order for you to be able to optimally react and make 
conscious choices, it is important for you to have a well-defined objective or 
goal in mind. This lecture will identify a set of nontrivial potential goals an 
investor might have. 
Return Targets and Risk 
• 
Think about an appropriate set of goals and objectives you might 
have as an investor. That is, what are the different aspects of 
investment performance you might care about? These objectives 
include things like the following.
○
○
Return targets/benchmarks and risk
 
○
○
Time horizon and desire for bequests
 
○
○
Growth versus income, liquidity
• 
The first item is risk and return. If risk and return were considered 
separately, everyone would make trivial choices: Everyone wants 
high return and no risk. But there are very few things you can do 
that will increase your average returns without increasing risk. 
• 
The most notable thing you can do to increase return without 
bearing more risk is to invest with pretax dollars via a pension 
fund, 401(k), or individual retirement account. These accounts 
either let you invest with salary before it is taxed or let you deduct 
your investment from your taxable income. You will be taxed 
eventually, but always in the future. This is better than getting taxed 

5
now because you will have more of your money making money, 
working for you. 
• 
Of course, there are legal limits on the amount you can invest in 
these ways, but you should invest as much as you can these ways. If 
not, you are merely increasing your taxes, with no personal benefit 
associated with this increased cost. 
• 
Aside from tax strategies, most other strategies entail bearing more 
risk to get a higher return. As a consequence, it is important for you 
to reflect on your personal trade-off between risk and return. How 
much extra return do you have to get in order to be willing to take 
on a risk? Similarly, how much wealth are you willing to give up 
in order to shed risk? It is fairly difficult to answer these types of 
questions quantitatively; however, this is the kind of trade-off you 
will be faced with often. 
• 
At this point, it is probably very difficult for you to quantify the 
trade-off between risk and return simply because it is difficult to 
know what risk is. The goal of this course is to give you metrics that

young and take an active role in managing your finances as you age.

Lecture 1: Investment Decisions and Goals
will allow you to compare risks across securities. These metrics are 
also useful for quantifying the risk of a portfolio. 
• 
There is a fairly prevalent notion that people should be less risk 
averse. Presumably, many entrepreneurs have risked everything to 
push what turned out to be the next revolutionary idea, including 
the Wright brothers and Steve Jobs.
• 
First, let’s make a clear distinction between opportunities and 
preferences. Many of the strategies you will develop in this 
course are important because they provide you with a best set 
of opportunities within which to choose. However, within that 
set of best opportunities, you must decide which one of those 
opportunities is optimal for you. That’s because what is optimal 
for you depends on your preferences, or how you feel about how 
wealth contributes to and how risk detracts from your happiness.
• 
Second, regarding the suggestion that everyone must take risk to 
succeed, there is the notion that perhaps our preferences get in the 
way of our opportunities—that sometimes we limit our outcomes 
because we underestimate what we could achieve if we just got out 
of our own way. Often, people systematically fail to see the full 
set of opportunities they could create for themselves, and because 
of that, they choose actions that foreclose on opportunities that 
would make them better off. However, the notion that you have 
to take risks to succeed might simply be a misguided conclusion 
based on bad statistics and confusion about something called  
conditional probability.
• 
A conditional probability is the probability that something will 
happen conditional on something else happening. With respect to 
risk taking and success, there are two conditional probabilities that 
we might calculate. One is the probability that, given that someone 
is successful now, they took risk in the past. The other conditional 
probability is the probability that, given that someone took risk in 
the past, they are successful now.

7
• 
If you are trying to decide whether to take risk or not, then 
the probability of success given risk versus the probability of 
success given that you don’t take risk are the relevant conditional 
probabilities. You want to know, conditional on taking risk, how 
many people succeed versus fail—not, conditional on success, how 
many people took risk versus played it safe. 
Time Horizon and Bequest Motives
• 
A second important dimension for an investment strategy is your 
time horizon. There are two aspects to this. The first has to do 
with the passage of time and the natural cycles of life: your age 
relative to retirement. While we all probably have preferences for 
being one age versus 
another, this aspect 
is not something you 
choose. The second 
aspect, however, is 
driven purely by your 
preferences: whether 
you want to consume 
all of your wealth 
eventually or whether 
you want to leave a 
legacy, or bequest.
• 
Both of these aspects 
matter because they 
affect some very basic parts of an optimal investment strategy. You 
view your human capital—the biggest asset you have—as part of 
your investment portfolio. As such, your investment strategies may 
be different as you get a clearer sense of what that asset is worth 
and how much you can alter it. 
• 
Your goals regarding a legacy have an impact on the rate at which 
you should save when young and the rate at which you should 
consume out of savings or your investment when old. For these

whether you want to bequest some or all of 
your wealth at your time of death.

Lecture 1: Investment Decisions and Goals
aspects, you should think of your investment strategy as having 
two dimensions: a time-series, or dynamic, dimension and a cross-
sectional, or static, dimension. 
• 
For the static dimension, you should put yourself in a particular 
place in your life and in a particular market condition. In each of 
the states, you need to consider how to allocate your wealth in that 
state cross-sectionally—i.e., across all of the available investments 
in the market. 
• 
The dynamic part has to do with the fact that in each of these 
states, you may want to hold different cross-sectional portfolios. 
For example, you will want more risky equity when you’re 
young and more risk-free fixed income when you’re old. As a 
consequence, you should look ahead and make gradual adjustments 
from one cross-section to the next. That is, you need a dynamic  
transition strategy. 
• 
Some of the changes in the “states” will be predictable, such as 
your age and retirement. The exact timing of other states will be 
much less predictable; for example, when will there be a recession? 
In terms of your goals and preferences, you need to figure out the 
extent to which you care about maintaining a given lifestyle. 
Growth, Income, and Liquidity 
• 
A third investment dimension you should come to terms with is 
your need for income from your investments versus your desire for 
growth in the value of your portfolio. For this, again you have to 
be careful not to mix up opportunities and preferences. You may 
have a definite preference—or need—for having your investments 
generate a steady stream of income, for example, because you are 
retired with no other ongoing source of income to support your 
monthly expenses. In contrast, if you are young and have a job that 
more than covers your expenses, rather than have your investments 
generate cash now, you may prefer that they simply grow in value 
over time. 

9
• 
However, sometimes the growth-versus-income distinction spills 
over into a limit on opportunities. If you need income, then you might 
be tempted to only consider funds that focus on income-generating 
securities, such as the stocks of firms that pay high dividends. Funds 
that focus on growth stocks, on the other hand, invest in the equity 
of firms that, rather than pay dividends, reinvest their earnings back 
in the firm to fuel expansions and increases in the stock price. 
• 
Thus, with the growth-versus-income objective, you typically get a 
difference in the types of securities considered. That is, by picking 
a particular objective, you may be a priori limiting the types of 
investment opportunities available to you. 
• 
A better way to think about growth versus income is in terms of 
liquidity, which is defined in two dimensions: the time dimension 
and the price dimension. A liquid security is one that can be turned 
into cash (i.e., liquidated) very quickly, without having the price 
fall significantly. If, keeping the price fixed, it takes a long time 
to find a buyer at that price, that security is not very liquid. And, 
if over a short period you have to drop the price by a lot to get a 
buyer, then that security is also not very liquid. 
• 
Think of the liquidity of a security as determining how costly it is 
to trade, with more liquid securities being cheap to trade and less 
liquid securities being expensive. Your desire for liquidity can be 
related to your objective to have your investments generate income 
or growth. 
Time/Effort
• 
There is another dimension that you need to come to terms with 
that is not typically mentioned but is extremely important. As part 
of your objectives, you should view your approach to investment 
management not solely in terms of the growth and stability in your 
wealth it produces. You should also consider the cost and benefit 
of the time you spend managing your investments—and not doing 
other things, like focusing on your career, your kids or grandkids, a 
hobby, etc.

10
Lecture 1: Investment Decisions and Goals
• 
Your calculus for any strategy should always consider the extra 
cost (in terms of time and effort, transactions costs, risk) versus the 
extra benefit of adopting that strategy. This principle should apply 
when making micro decisions, but it equally applies at the macro 
level, when you decide whether to manage your own investments or 
delegate to professionals and when you decide to adopt an active or 
a passive approach. 
• 
If passive, you simply invest in a well-diversified portfolio that 
can be on automatic pilot. Periodically, you will have to make 
some adjustments, because no practically obtainable portfolio can 
be completely passive. In contrast, if active, you must be active 
on three fronts: You have to be active in collecting and analyzing 
information, actively respond to your analysis and trade, and 
continually evaluate the effectiveness of the first two. 
• 
The key issue regarding active versus passive management is 
whether you can earn a high enough return on your effort and time 
to justify active management. Evidence will only show you the 
financial benefit and costs of activeness; only you can put a value 
on your time and attention.

to preferring option B over option A? If the switch occurs higher in 
the table, you are more risk averse than if the switch is lower in the 
table. Why? Does your switching point change if you multiply the dollar 
amounts in the table by 100? 1000? 10,000?

family, and/or travel. If you have not yet retired, do you think you will 
want to spend more or less money per month when retired than when 
working? If you have retired, what did you expect and what actually 
happened relative to what you expected? Did you actually think about 
your spending habits prior to retirement?

Lecture 2: A Framework for Investing
A Framework for Investing
Lecture 2
F
or investments, so much is driven by the aggregate behavior of many, 
many investors all expressing their views through a market. To the 
extent that the aggregate beliefs of investors can be subject to both 
whim and information, it is very difficult to know what current prices mean. 
There is a framework within which to consider investments, and you will 
learn the structure of that framework in this lecture. You will learn how you 
can layer various types of active management strategies on top of a passive 
market portfolio. 
Step 1
• 
This framework lets you see exactly where you might be able to add 
value and how to evaluate whether you are actually adding value. 
This framework can also be useful for seeing where and whether a 
professional is adding value for you. 
• 
Step 1 is to start with a passive portfolio, one that mirrors every 
security in the world. While such a portfolio will be difficult to 
build on your own (because it will be too expensive), many mutual 
fund companies (like Fidelity or Vanguard) offer index funds that 
are designed to mirror broad-based indexes, which themselves are 
like portfolios of securities selected by some criterion.
• 
Spend some time looking on the Internet to find either index funds 
or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are supposed to track such 
indexes as the S&P 500, the Russell 2000, and the MSCI. Because 
these funds are just supposed to track an index (that is, when the 
index goes up 1%, the fund increases in value by 1%, too), the 
managers of these funds are not actively managing the fund by 
trying to find securities or form positions that will outperform the 
index. Thus, you want to find a fund or an ETF with the lowest fees 
and the lowest tracking error.

13
• 
An ETF is a closed-end fund. Think of an ETF as merely a firm 
that, instead of owning machines, buildings, and raw materials, 
owns financial securities. Thus, you can buy and sell shares in these 
ETF firms. 
• 
Many specialized ETFs are formed to mirror the returns of a specific 
sector (such as consumer goods, financials, health care, technology, 
utilities, services, etc.) or an industry (such as automobiles, 
telecommunications, etc.) within a specific sector. In fact, they tell 
you exactly what they hold. Thus, because there are market prices 
for the securities they hold, it is fairly easy to know what the value 
of the ETF is—it’s simply the value of the portfolio they hold. 
Step 2
• 
Now that we have a passive portfolio that represents all of the 
sectors and locations across the globe, we know, at a minimum, we 
will be able to capture the returns on the “market.” The idea is that 
because people typically don’t like risk, they discount the prices of 
the securities in the market below the value that they will generate in 
the future, on average. Because people are risk averse and discount 
prices, there is a positive average return associated with investing. 

14
Lecture 2: A Framework for Investing
• 
Step 1 assures you that you will get growth on your savings. In step 
2, you want see if you can beat the market in some way. There are a 
few ways you can do that.
• 
Let’s say that you have a bunch of ETFs for each sector. And, 
because we want to be passive, we’re going to want to divide the 
money we’re going to invest into amounts to invest in each sector 
in proportion to the amount of wealth these sectors represent in 
terms of total market cap. 
• 
That is, we want to determine what fraction of the total 
amount of money invested in the world that is invested in the 
manufacturing sector, for example. We invest that fraction 
in a manufacturing sector ETF. And whatever fraction of the 
total money invested is invested in financials, we invest that 
fraction of our money in a financial sector ETF—and so on. 
If we do that, we will have a passive portfolio. We will own  
the market. 
Beating the Market
• 
With this structure, there are three things that you can do  
to beat the market—that is, to get a bigger return than the 
market return. The first thing you can do is to try to “time” the 
market. You have all of the money you want to invest in this market 
portfolio of risky securities. The broadest thing you can do to beat 
the market is to get out of the market and into low-risk treasury 
bonds if you think the market is going to go down. 
• 
Of course, this raises a bunch of questions, including which 
bonds to buy. But the main point is that you can beat the market 
by moving money in and out of treasuries. If the market is 
going to out-perform treasuries, then take money out of the 
savings account and buy stock. But if you think the market is 
going to fall, then take your money out of the market and put it  
in treasuries. 

15
• 
It is likely that there are significant differences in the risks of all 
stock versus all treasuries, but if you can predict which market will 
do better, then there is no risk—you always get the higher of the 
two returns. If you think it is impossible to predict which market 
will do better, then there is a big difference in risk, and a better 
approach would be to hold some in treasuries and some in stock. 
• 
For example, if you start out with 40% safe treasuries and 60% 
global stock, then you can try to do better by upping the 60% 
in stock when you think stocks are going to do well and upping 
the 40% on treasuries when you think stocks might tank. This is 
asset allocation—that is, you must decide how to allocate your 
investment across asset types, with stocks and bonds being the two 
most common types. 
• 
Holding fixed the amount you have in stock versus treasuries, the 
second thing you can do is to reallocate money across sectors. This 
is easy to do if you have sector funds or ETFs. Just sell off some 
of your position in one ETF and use the proceeds to buy more of 
another ETF in a different sector. This makes sense if you think that 
the return in the sector you sell will be lower than the return in the 
sector you buy into. In a sense, you are timing not the “market,” but 
across sectors. 
• 
The third thing you can do is, while holding fixed the amount you 
whave in risky securities and holding fixed the amount you have 
within each sector, you can try to find individual securities within 
a sector that you think may outperform that sector. This is stock 
picking. The idea is that you can, by studying individual securities, 
find those that you think are undervalued and will go up a lot. While 
this stock may be in your ETF already, it will likely represent a very 
small fraction of the ETF. 
• 
For some ETFs for fairly broadly defined sectors, the biggest stock 
held by the ETF will represent only a few percent, with many ETFs 
holding hundreds of securities. For some sectors defined by a few 
very large firms, a single firm may be 10 to 15% of the ETF.

Lecture 2: A Framework for Investing
• 
This way of thinking about an investment portfolio makes clear 
what you need to do to justify moving away from a passive 
“market” portfolio. In order for you to do any of the three things 
noted to beat the market, you have to make clear why you think 
stocks will do better than treasuries, why one sector or industry will 
do better than some other sector or industry, and why an individual 
stock you want to buy will do better than the sector or industry that 
that stock resides in as a whole. You must convince yourself. 
• 
There are two things you need to do to convince yourself. The first 
is to understand the sector or industry. What allows some firms to 
make higher profits than others? Is that sustainable or contestable? 
If something is going to change in the future, what makes one firm 
better than another at adjusting to these changing conditions? And 
if the market is going to change in some way in the future, what 
changes favor one firm over another? It is important to have clarity 
on exactly what you are betting on. 
• 
Once you know that you have a firm that will do better under one 
circumstance than another, then you know what you’re betting on, 
and you can be more focused in collecting information that will 
help you characterize the likelihood that that firm will do better 
than others. 
• 
On the other side, think about what might go wrong. Is the company 
you are looking at one that has an advantage now? How typical is it 
that such advantages are short lived—that other firms can leapfrog 
over them in terms of technology? Is there a risk that something big 
may fail? How common is such an event? 
• 
Basically, think about what would make a particular firm experience 
a significant loss. If you cannot think of such a loss, then that’s 
good. But if you can, then ask yourself, why you would buy just 
that firm when you could own many such firms? The chance of all 
of them having a catastrophic failure is much lower than any one of 
them having such a failure. If you can think of any sources for such 

17
failures or think that such failures are common, then you better be 
sure about your bet paying off before you expose yourself to such  
a bad outcome. 
• 
Once you have a clear picture of what you are betting on will and 
won’t happen, the second thing you have to do is ask yourself 
whether or not the market already knows and reflects what you 
know. A company that is run better than another is not necessarily a 
better investment; it is only a better investment if its superiority is 
not already valued by the market. 
• 
The fourth thing you have to do once you have convinced yourself 
that it is not reflected by the market is to ask yourself what other 
things that you may not have thought about may be reflected in 
the market—what may keep the price low because that is where it 
should be.

Mistakes Investors Make
Lecture 3
I
n this lecture, you will learn about three cognitive biases that can impair 
a person’s investment performance: framing, biased self-attribution, and 
seeing patterns when none exist. You will learn about these cognitive 
mistakes for two main reasons. First, while it may be true that you personally 
do not make such cognitive mistakes, that is not true for the majority of 
people. In addition, one of the most common cognitive mistakes people 
make is in assessing their own susceptibility for making systematic cognitive 
mistakes. A second reason to examine the types of cognitive errors human 
make is to potentially profit from any systematic pricing errors that such 
biases might create. 
Framing
• 
That people can suffer from a framing bias is something that 
psychologists have documented many times in experiments. 
Framing involves making different choices based on how a problem 
is presented—not based on fundamental differences among the 
choices. What this implies is kind of disturbing. 
• 
First, it implies that our choices can be manipulated by framing. 
Marketing people make a living doing that, so that is not surprising. 
Second, the systematic difference in responses also implies that, 
completely independent of the facts of the statistics, context may 
drive our decisions. 
• 
An example of this is the phenomenon that investors tend to sell 
winners and hold on to losers—even when there is no relationship 
between future returns and past returns. Even if, regardless of 
whether the stock just went up or just went down, there is a 50-
50 chance of winning or losing over the next period, most people 
would prefer to sell the past winner and hold on to the past loser. 

20
Lecture 3: Mistakes Investors Make
• 
Having an asymmetry based on past performance is just like the 
framing bias; although the past has nothing to do with your future 
opportunities, people typically make systematically different 
decisions depending on the past return. Similarly, although the 
possible outcomes have nothing to do with whether the outcomes are 
expressed in terms of saving lives or death, people systematically 
make different decisions depending on the framing. 
• 
One possible explanation for why investors sell winners faster than 
losers is because, deep down, they do not want to admit failure. 
By selling a stock that just went down, they are realizing the loss, 
which prevents them from being able to claim, if only in their own 
heads, that it really was a good investment because it’s going to 
come back. However, if they sell a winner, they get to claim that 
they are good investors, before it has a chance to go down and 
prove them wrong. 
Many stockholders make cognitive mistakes that lead them to make bad 
decisions regarding buying and selling their stocks.

• 
However, to the extent that their actions are driven by something 
nonmonetary (i.e., their pride), such asymmetries may reduce their 
investment performance. If there is no relation between past returns 
and future returns, then such an asymmetry will not be costly. But if 
there is momentum in returns, the asymmetry locks in a subsequent 
loss and forecloses on a subsequent gain. 
Biased Self-Attribution
• 
Another thing that people tend to do on average is called biased 
self-attribution, which is when a person doesn’t assign blame or 
credit fairly. Consider a woman named Jane, who heard a report on 
CNN on a biotech firm that is creating what the report said was a 
series of compounds that might increase the effectiveness of certain 
treatments for diabetes. Jane thought that the CEO not only seemed 
to be a nice guy who genuinely cared about diabetics having more 
effective treatments, but was also a smart guy who seemed to have 
a lot of integrity. On the basis of that report, Jane bought 200 shares 
of the company at $15 per share. 
• 
The next day, Jane was watching CNN again and saw a report 
on a cybersecurity firm that had developed a firewall based on an 
innovative structure designed to protect information passed by 
mobile devices. She could tell, just by listening to the CEO speak 
about the varied applications, that this new design could uniquely 
protect and that he, too, was a smart guy with integrity and a passion 
for his product. So, she bought 100 shares of that firm, which were 
selling for $50 per share. 
• 
A month later, she saw that the cybersecurity firm had risen from 
$50 to $56, a 12% return in just over a month; at that rate, her initial 
investment of $5000 would grow almost 4 times that after a year. 
She knew that it was unreasonable to expect that she would get a 
12% return every month, but still she felt pretty good. 
• 
The next day, news came out that one of the bio products the biotech 
firm thought had such promise failed to pass some tests of the Food 
and Drug Administration, tests that had to be passed before they 

22
Lecture 3: Mistakes Investors Make
could turn it into a drug that could be widely distributed. The stock 
price fell from the level she paid of $15 all the way down to $9, for 
a $1200 loss (or 40%—in just a month). That night, she complained 
to her husband that she would have done well on this investment 
if it weren’t for the FDA. Not only did she feel that the firm was 
wronged, but she also felt that she was wronged, having lost 40% 
of her investment based on what appeared to be an unreliable test.
• 
Jane suffers from biased self-attribution, which is when a person 
gives themselves credit for what turned out to be a good decision 
but places blame elsewhere when a decision you made turns out 
poorly. In Jane’s case, she took credit for her seeing something 
in the cybersecurity CEO but blamed the FDA for the loss on the 
biotech firm. 
• 
Biased self-attribution can be really costly in terms of your ability 
to accumulate wealth because, if you believe what Jane believes, 
you will teach yourself to be overconfident. If every time something 
good happens, it’s because of your skill, but every time something 
bad happens, it’s not because of your skill, then you will get a false 
sense of ability. In Jane’s case, she will get the sense that she can 
judge a good investment just by seeing the CEO speak. If she has 
this sense, then she may neglect doing the kinds of analyses that 
will actually identify opportunities and risks. 
Seeing Patterns When None Exist
• 
Consider the plot of a stock price over the course of day. Do you 
see any patterns, or are the price changes completely random? 
Experimental psychologists find that most people tend to believe 
that there is a pattern in the random sequence—that is, they see a 
pattern when there is none. This is problematic when it comes to 
investing because patterns typically imply trade opportunities. 
• 
If you knew there was a stock with the property that every time it 
went up, the next day it had a 60% chance of going up again, and  
every time it went down, there was a 60% change it would go down 

23
the next day, then you could make a lot of money buying after up 
days and selling after down days. 
• 
People look for patterns, even patterns that aren’t sure. But what 
if you see a pattern when none exists? Reacting to nonexistent 
patterns can be costly. And even if a slight pattern exists, you can 
lose a significant amount of money in the short run. 
• 
A good question is why we see patterns when none exist. One 
explanation is that this is a throwback to when we lived in more 
primitive times, when sabre-toothed tigers existed. If, back then, 
we believed that every time the grass rustled, we were more likely 
than not to get attacked by a sabre-toothed tiger, then whenever we 
heard the grass rustle, we would run for our lives. Of course, we 
probably did a lot of unnecessary running, but that was OK. 
• 
There are two types of errors we can make. In statistics, there 
are labeled as type I and type II errors. Type I error is rejecting a 
hypothesis that is true. Type II error is accepting (actually, failing to 
reject) a hypothesis that is false. 
• 
If a person is presumed innocent unless proven guilty, then we say 
that a court commits a type I error when they convict an innocent 
person; the court commits a type II error when they let a guilty 
person go free. In this court example, it may not be clear which type 
of error is worse. 
• 
But for the sabre-toothed tiger case, the maintained hypothesis is 
that rustling grass is a tiger. Thus, a type I error is not running when 
a tiger is there while a type II error is running when there is no 
tiger there. Clearly, there is a big difference in the costs of these two 
errors. The cost of the type I error is being eaten by a tiger while the 
cost of the type II error is getting out of breath and maybe having 
sore legs. Thus, humans may have a bias to believe something is 
there even when it is not fairly frequently. 

24
Lecture 3: Mistakes Investors Make
• 
You may do this to yourself when looking for patterns in returns or 
prices. In fact, it is fairly easy to do because the types of patterns 
we think we see are often not easily quantified. Chartists are people 
who do technical analysis to look for and trade on patterns. If you 
use a chartist to describe the patterns, they typically explain that 
it’s not a set pattern so much as the sense of a pattern—that no two 
patterns look exactly the same, but they are very similar in shape. 
• 
In other words, it’s like interpreting shapes in clouds. If it were easy 
to quantify, then you could do that and reject some patterns. But 
because it’s difficult to quantify, it’s more difficult to reject—or 
easier to believe. So, be careful.

The Characteristics of Security Returns
Lecture 4
I
n this lecture, you will be introduced to a set of concepts and formulas 
from probability and statistics that you should think about and use 
whenever you think about investing. These concepts and formulas are the 
building blocks of slow, deliberative, purposeful thinking about investments. 
In particular, these concepts and formulas allow you to quantify how the 
characteristics of individual securities affect the risk of portfolios that you 
can build. The goal is for you to have an intuitive understanding of what 
these measures mean. 
Returns
• 
There are many securities in which you could invest; the issue is not 
which ones you should invest in but how much you should invest 
in each. In order to be able to optimize over the set of possible 
portfolios, we first need to be able to quantify certain characteristics 
of the behavior of asset returns as inputs to that process. We will 
characterize each individual asset according to its expected return, 
its return variance (or volatility), and the covariance (or correlation) 
of its return with the returns on other assets. 
• 
Consider the situation in which you want to hold all securities for 
a fixed interval of time (or period). We will let t denote time. That 
is, any arbitrary point in time might be generically labeled t; one 
period, hence, will be t + 1. The length of the period may vary 
according to the specific investment issues being considered. For 
now, think of a period as a quarter (3 months) or a year. 
• 
Next, consider the return of an individual security over a period—
from t to t + 1. There are two components to any return. The first 
is due to any change in the price of the security. This is called the 
capital gain (or loss, if the price falls). The second is due to any 
cash flow generated during the interval; for stocks, the payment of 

26
Lecture 4: The Characteristics of Security Returns
a dividend creates such a cash flow, while coupon payments are a 
source of cash flows for bonds. The return due to the payment of a 
dividend is referred to as the dividend yield. 
• 
Regardless of whether we are taking about a stock, bond, or 
derivative security (such as a call option), we will let Pt denote the 
price at t, Pt+1 denote the price one period hence—at t + 1—and Dt+1 
be the value at t + 1 of any cash flows generated during the interval 
from t to t + 1. 
• 
Given these conventions, the return of a security from t to t + 1 
(which we will denoted by Rt) is defined as follows.

• 
That is, the first part is your percentage capital gain—what you sold 
it for (i.e., Pt+1) minus what you paid (i.e., Pt)—relative to what you 
paid, Pt. The second part is the dividend yield equals the dividend 
or cash flow during the period divided by the price you paid. 
Returns as Random Variables 
• 
At the time when an asset or security is purchased, the return on 
any security can be viewed as a random variable. Given the way 
that we have defined returns, there are two sources of randomness 
that can creep in. One source of randomness is due to changes in 
the market value of the security as reflected in the future price, Pt+1, 
relative to the current price, Pt. 
• 
The market value of the security changes when there is new 
information that comes to light concerning the future cash flows of 
the security. Because news by its very nature is unpredictable, the 
future arrival of news is random, and as a result, the future price 
will differ from the current price in random ways. 

27
• 
A second source comes from any unpredictable changes in the cash 
flows Dt+1. The dividends paid on common stock are not fixed; 
rather, it is up to the firm’s management to decide how much to pay 
out as a dividend. Whatever they decide, the value of Dt+1 is not 
fully predictable at t. However, firms try to keep dividends fairly 
constant over time. 
• 
For bonds, in which the Dt+1 represents a coupon payment, there 
can be randomness in Dt+1 due to the possibility of default, in which 
the bond issuers cannot satisfy their promised payments. 
• 
In addition to the direct effect of a random Dt+1 on the randomness 
of the return, the realized value of Dt+1 may also affect the market’s 
beliefs about the security’s value, which will affect Pt+1 and 
contribute to the randomness of the return via the first channel. 
How to Characterize Randomness Mathematically
• 
The way mathematicians (and financial economists) typically think 
about randomness is with the concept of a frequency distribution 
or a probability density function. A frequency distribution specifies 
how frequently each of the possible values that could be realized 
would appear in a very large sample. Alternatively, the frequency 
distribution specifies how likely it is that a particular value will 
occur in one sampling. 
• 
Similarly, a probability density function specifies how much 
probability (or density) is associated with each possible outcome. 
• 
In general, when certain quantities are random, there are a few 
measures used to characterize the randomness. The first is the 
expected value, which is often referred to as a measure of central 
tendency. The second is the variance, which captures the degree of 
dispersion of the possible values about its central tendency. These 
first two characterize the behavior of a single random variable—
for example, the return on a single security. A third measure, the 
covariance or the related correlation coefficient, measures how two 
random variables are related to each other. 

28
Lecture 4: The Characteristics of Security Returns
Expected Return 
• 
A security’s expected return is defined as the probability weighted 
average of the possible values the return might end up being. 
Mathematically, the expected return is E(R) = (Prob(R = R1)(R1)) 
+ … + (Prob(R = Rk)(Rk)). Let the set of possible values of returns 
be ranked and numbered—that is, let R1 be the lowest possible 
return and R2 be the next, all the way up to Rk , which is the highest 
possible value. 
• 
The expected return can be thought of as the average value that 
would occur if you were to “sample” the return many, many times 
(for example, 1 million times). A simple average is the sum of all 
the values divided by the number of observations. In the expected 
value formula, the probability associated with a particular return 
represents how frequently that return will appear in a large sample. 
As such, the formula for the expected value as a weighted average, 
with probabilities for weights, quantifies the simple average return 
one would get in repeated sampling.

29
• 
Statisticians also refer to the expected value as the “mean.” 
Throughout this course, “mean,” “average,” and “expected value” 
will be used interchangeably. 
Variance 
• 
The expected value does not tell you everything. How close you 
will get to the expected value depends on the variance, which is 
the expected value of the squared deviation of the variable from 
its mean. There are many possible deviations from the mean, with 
some realized values above the mean and some below the mean. If 
we take each possible deviation and square it, the squares are all 
positive. And associated with each value from the set of squared 
deviations is a probability. The variance is simply the expected 
value of the possible squared deviations. Thus, the variance is a 
measure of dispersion about the mean. 
• 
Mathematically, the variance is as follows.
○
○
Var(R) = E((R − E(R))2) =
 
○
○
(Prob(R = R1))(R1 − E(R))2 + … + (Prob(R = Rk))(Rk − E(R))2. 
• 
This is just like the expected value, but instead of Prob(R = Ri) 
multiplying Ri, it multiplies the squared deviation of Ri from its 
mean (i.e., Ri − E(R))2). 
○
○
Var(R) = E((R − E(R))2) = (Prob(R = R1))(R1 − E(R))2 + … + 
(Prob(R = Rk))(Rk − E(R))2
 
○
○
E(R) = (Prob(R = R1))(R1) + … + (Prob(R = Rk)(Rk).
• 
A measure that is related to variance is the standard deviation. The 
standard deviation is simply defined as SD(R) = σ = Var(R)(1/2). The 
standard deviation of return SD(R) is more intuitive because it is in 
percentages; a variance is in percent squared. Think of the standard 
deviation as kind of an average for the size of a deviation from the 
mean return percent.

30
Lecture 4: The Characteristics of Security Returns
• 
Also, the convention is to call the standard deviation of returns 
“volatility.” In standard conversational English, there is no 
distinction between variance and volatility; both mean variability 
around some norm. But in investments, there is a big difference—
the square root.
Covariance 
• 
Mathematical statistics has a way to quantify the relationship 
between any two random variables. One concept is that of a joint 
distribution. The joint distribution between any two random 
variables (e.g., returns) is a specification of the probabilities 
associated with each possible pair of values. 
• 
Being able to calculate means and variances from marginal 
probabilities is not why a joint distribution is useful, however. 
Importantly, the joint distribution tells you how likely it is that two 
variables move together, independently, or in opposite directions—
on average. Mathematically, using the information contained in the 
joint distribution between any two random variables, the covariance 
is defined as follows.
○
○
Cov(R1, R2) = E((R1 − E(R1))(R2 − E(R2)))
• 
That is, the covariance is the expected value of the possible paired 
deviations of each from their mean. 
• 
If, according to the joint distribution, there is a lot of probability 
associated with cases in which (a) the first is above its mean and 
the second is below its mean and (b) the first is below its mean and 
the second is above its mean, then the covariance will be negative. 
This is true because most of the values of (R1 − E(R1))(R2 − E(R2)) 
are negative (because either a negative times a positive or a positive 
times a negative is negative).
• 
If, instead, most of the probability is associated with cases in which 
(a) the first is above its mean and the second is, too; and (b) the 
first is below its mean and so is the second, then the covariance 
is positive. This is true because most of the values of (R1 − E(R1))

31
(R2 − E(R2)) are positive (because a positive times a positive and a 
negative times a negative are both positive). 
• 
The correlation coefficient scales the covariance for the size of the 
variance of each. 
○
○
Corr = ρ = rho = Cov(R1, R2)/(SD1 × SD2). 
• 
In general, correlation coefficients range from 1 to −1. If the 
correlation between two variables is 1, then it is the case that one 
of the variables is a constant positive multiple of the other. That 
is, if you know the value of one, you can know the value of the 
other exactly. At the other extreme, two variables can be perfectly 
negatively correlated (and the correlation coefficient will be −1). 
Again, you can perfectly predict the other knowing the one. 
• 
If the correlation is 0, that means that knowing something about 
the one tells you nothing about the other. This makes sense in that 
the correlation is 0 when the covariance is 0. And the covariance is 
0 when it is as equally likely that when one variable (or return) is 
above its mean, the other may be above or below its mean. 
• 
A correlation between 0 and 1 means that the two variables vary 
in the same direction, but not perfectly; knowing one gives you a 
general idea of what the other will be. A correlation between 0 and 
−1 means that the two variables vary in the opposite direction, but 
not perfectly. The closer the magnitude of the correlation is to 0, the 
weaker the relationship. The closer the magnitude of the correlation 
is to 1, the stronger the relationship.

2.	 You have $1,000,000 invested in the market; over the next year, the 
market is expected to return 10% with a standard deviation of 15%. 
Alternatively, you can invest at the risk-free T-bill rate of 1.5%. Thus, 
if you invest in the market, after a year, you will have $1,100,000 
on average, for a $100,000 average gain; if you invest in the risk-
free T-bills, you will have $1,015,000, a $15,000 gain. If returns are 
normally distributed, then the probability that you will have less than 
1,015,000 by investing in the market is around 30%. (That is, there is a 
70% chance you will do better investing in the market than investing in 
the risk-free T-bills.) Which do you prefer: investing in the market or the 
risk-free T-bills?

The Theory of Efficient Markets
Lecture 5
I
n this lecture, you will begin to learn about the efficient market 
hypothesis in detail. First, the efficient market hypothesis will be defined. 
Second, you will explore what the hypothesis implies with respect to 
both security price movements and the ability of various market participants 
to make excess returns. Third, you will examine the empirical evidence on 
whether the implications of the efficient market hypothesis hold in data from 
actual markets. This third step will be done in a later lecture. 
The Efficient Market Hypothesis
• 
The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is that financial markets are 
efficient. There are two senses of the word “efficient,” one of which 
is what the EMH refers to directly. The other meaning sometimes is 
considered an indirect implication of the first meaning.
• 
The EMH is directly about informational efficiency. The market 
for a particular security is said to be informationally efficient if 
all available information that is relevant with respect to the future 
value of that security is reflected in the current price of that security. 
The key is that the current price reflects everything available of 
relevance to future value. 
• 
An efficient market for a security is one in which newly available 
information is reflected quickly. If it takes time for new information 
to be reflected in the price of a security, then there is a significant 
amount of time in which the price of that security does not reflect 
that available information, which is a violation of the EMH. 
The Weak Form
• 
There are three forms to the EMH, which differ in terms of what 
is considered “available.” One is the so-called weak form of the 
EMH. It is the weakest form in the sense that it is the easiest form to 
satisfy—that is, it is the form with the fewest conditions. The weak 

34
Lecture 5: The Theory of Efficient Markets
form states that any information that can be gleaned about future 
prices from past prices (or returns) will be reflected in the current 
price. That is, it defines “available” information as including only 
past prices. This is a weak form because, while it may be difficult 
for many people to know about, and understand the implications of, 
the firm’s strategic plans say that it should be easy for people to get 
past price information. 
• 
The principle implication of the weak form is that there are no 
predictable patterns in returns. A predictable pattern might be 
something like the following: After the market drops by more 
than 1%, 90% of the time, the return the next day is bigger than 
the average return over the previous year. This is a violation of 
the EMH because, if one can predict with reasonable accuracy (in 
this case, 90%) that the price is going to be significantly higher 
tomorrow, then the price today should be higher in anticipation  
of this. 

35
• 
If the above fact is true for a particular security, then that fact is 
typically taken as evidence that, on average, the market for that 
security overreacts to bad news—and following that overreaction, 
it corrects itself the next day. If the market overreacts to good news, 
too, then the return following a day with a large positive return 
will, on average, be negative, overturning some of the prior day’s 
reaction. That is, what goes up comes back down, and what goes 
down comes back up. 
• 
If the market were to underreact on average, then following good 
news (and a positive return), there would be another positive return 
the next day, on average. And following bad news—and a negative 
return that day—there would be another negative return the next 
day. These cases are also violations of the EMH because the 
average price level the next day is not reflected in the current price. 
If investors know that the price will be higher the day after good 
news, then why don’t they bid up the price today? If they don’t, 
then the current price does not reflect their expectation, which is a 
violation of the EMH. 

36
Lecture 5: The Theory of Efficient Markets
• 
Thus, the weak form of the EMH implies that you can’t “time” the 
market by trading in advance of predictable price changes. It is 
sometimes said that the weak form implies that price changes are 
unpredictable. Equivalently, it is said that under the weak form, 
prices follow what is called a random walk. 
• 
Note that the unpredictable price change and random walk 
implication is really only an implication of the weak form in 
markets where no one cares about risk; that is, these features only 
hold in markets populated solely by risk-neutral people, which are 
people who only care about the average return, not the possible 
variability in the return. 
• 
In a risk-neutral world, the average returns will be just the risk-free 
return, which is the return that induces people to give up current 
consumption in exchange for future consumption. That is, the risk-
free rate is the rate that only reflects the time trade-off—not the risk 
trade-off. Because no one cares about risk in this risk-neutral world, 
all interest rates (or returns) are the same. 

37
• 
At very short intervals—for example, over a day—the return you 
need is typically very small. When risk-free rates are on the order 
of 1% (as they were following the financial crisis in 2008), then 
the daily return is 0.03 of a basis point. That’s very, very small—in 
fact, hardly discernible. 
• 
So, if the daily return on all securities is essentially zero on average, 
then the frequency with which prices rise will be essentially equal 
to the frequency with which they go down. The changes in price 
levels are due to the arrival of news. Because news is by definition 
unpredictable, the price changes must also be unpredictable. 
• 
This is consistent with the image of someone taking a random walk, 
whereby every step is independent of the previous step. Security 
prices are similar. If there is good news the next day, the price takes 
a step up; if there is bad news on that day, the price takes a step 
down. If you could systematically, perfectly predict the arrival of 
good news after some observable event, then the price would go up 
more when that event was observed, but not when the news actually 
came out. When the news actually came out, people would say that 
it’s not news. Rather, it’s old news (which is already reflected in the 
current price).
• 
If the average return is significant, then that would imply that the 
prices would drift up over time. That is, the price changes would be 
positive on average: When the price rises on one day, it is likely to 
rise the next day. 
• 
The only extent to which the future return is predictable is by the 
amount that generates an average return that compensates risk-
averse investors for bearing the risk over that period. With risk-
averse investors, the weak form of the EMH essentially says that 
excess returns (i.e., those returns in excess of the average return 
to compensate savers) are unpredictable. That is, if we were to 
subtract the average return from each return, the return that is left 
over is unpredictable. 

38
Lecture 5: The Theory of Efficient Markets
• 
The weak form of the EMF implies that you cannot make any 
excess returns by plunging in and out of the market on the basis of 
what you can glean from past prices. So, the issue is whether you 
can spot patterns or not. Consider a chart that shows a time series 
plot of a year’s worth of prices for a stock. If you see a pattern, you 
are not alone—but is there really a pattern? Plots of price levels can 
be difficult to interpret; maybe more accurately, they can be easy  
to overinterpret. 
• 
There is not much argument about the existence of predictability. 
However, there is significant argument as to whether that 
predictability represents predictability in excess returns or whether 
it is predictable variation in fair returns. 

39
The Semi-Strong Form
• 
The semi-strong form of the EMH is that available information 
includes past prices/returns and any public information (e.g., 
Procter & Gamble and Gillette are going to merge). This is less 
weak because prices have to reflect that which is reflected under the 
weak form plus the addition of public information. The semi-strong 
form implies that you cannot make excess returns using a trading 
strategy that reacts to public announcement of events or policies. 
• 
An example of a violation of semi-strong-form efficiency might 
entail the announcement of a corporate policy such as a dividend 
cut. Let’s say that the firm announces a dividend cut; at the 
announcement, the price declines. But on average, the price gains 
half of the drop back in the next week. Given this rebound, you 
can make money by buying after dividend cuts: Buy low and sell 
higher on average the following week. If there is a violation of 
semi-strong-form efficiency, then the market must not be valuing 
the implication of the announcement accurately; in this example, 
there is an overreaction. 
• 
Underreaction to an event will also produce a violation of semi-
strong efficiency. For example, if the price of a publically traded 
firm falls immediately after it announces that it is going to sell more 
equity, that by itself would not constitute evidence of a violation of 
the semi-strong form. However, if the price on average continued 
to fall for a year after the announcement, then the reaction at 
the announcement is not efficient—there was an underreaction,  
on average. 
The Strong Form
• 
The strong form of the EMH is that in addition to the stuff that 
should be reflected under the semi-strong form, it must also reflect 
private information. If markets are strong-form efficient, then 
even insiders cannot make trading profits by trading on insider 
information. This is called the strong form because it seems very 
unlikely to hold. 

40
Lecture 5: The Theory of Efficient Markets
• 
In addition, the strong form implies that right after the decision 
to adopt a given corporate policy is made—but before it is 
announced—the impact of the policy will be reflected in prices. 
There is some evidence that such information does leak out into 
prices. This is probably because of insider trading (which, although 
illegal, still happens). 
• 
There is something ironic about strong-form efficiency, however. 
Although it would be great to have prices be fully efficient and 
reflect everything, in such a world, there is no incentive to collect 
costly information in the first place. If a person cannot profitably 
trade on his or her superior information or analysis of value because 
prices reflect that information before they can trade, then no one 
will engage in that kind of activity—and prices will actually be less 
informative on average. The good news is that no one thinks that 
markets are strong-form efficient.

Evidence on Efficient Markets
Lecture 6
T
he last lecture examined the efficient market hypothesis and its 
implications. In this lecture, you will examine the body of empirical 
evidence on whether these implications are borne out in the data 
from actual markets. By examining this evidence, you will get a sense of 
where you might want to look for trading opportunities and where you need 
not bother. While most of the academic evidence is that markets are fairly 
efficient, even the academics have found a number of phenomena that seem 
to put chinks in the armor of the efficient market hypothesis. This lecture 
will look at some of the most notable phenomena. 
Momentum
• 
The first set of anomalies concerns predictable patterns in returns. 
These might be violations of the weak form of the EMH in that, 
presumably, you can make excess profits simply by executing trade 
strategies conditional on past returns or price levels. 
• 
There are a few of these anomalies; the first is the momentum 
phenomenon. To understand what this phenomenon is, consider the 
following strategy. Step 1 is to take a list of many securities—for 
example, those traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ—and calculate 
their returns over some past period. For example, calculate their 
return over the last 6 months. 
• 
Step 2 is to rank these securities from highest return to lowest 
return. Step 3 is to buy all of the securities in the top 10% (let’s call 
them the winners) and sell short all those securities in the bottom 
10% (let’s call them the losers). 

42
Lecture 6: Evidence on Efficient Markets
• 
The final step is to hold this portfolio for 6 months. Then, after 
those 6 months, do it again—that is, rerank all the securities on the 
NYSE and NASDAQ on the basis of the just-past 6-month return, 
and go long those securities in the winner 10% and sell short those 
in the loser 10%. Hold for another 6 months, and then repeat. 
• 
It has been shown that, on average, the returns from this strategy 
dominate the returns from a passive strategy of just holding a 
“market” portfolio consisting of all the securities on your original 
list. It has also been shown that such phenomena exist if you use 
different horizons. Furthermore, the magnitude of the extra return 
is fairly large; if you rebalance once a month, you can get about 
1% extra return, which is approximately 12% per year when 
compounded over 12 months. 
• 
According to the weak form of the EMH, you should not be able 
to beat the market by trading on the basis of past returns. However, 
this momentum strategy, as the name suggests, indicates that stocks 
that go up continue to go up, and stocks that go down continue to go 
down. This is a predictable pattern that is not supposed to happen if 
markets are weak-form efficient. 
Possible Efficient Explanations
• 
There are many retorts to this conclusion that appear in the 
academic literature. One retort is that it fails to consider transactions 
costs. Such a strategy is costly to implement, especially for a small 
investor. If you consider all the stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ, 
you’re talking about thousands and thousands of stocks—around 
7000 in total. 
• 
If you do the rebalancing each month, it turns out that many of the 
stocks that were in the winner portfolio over one period are not in 
the winner portfolio the next period. The same is true for the loser 
stocks. So, to implement this strategy, you have to trade a lot of 
stocks each period. And if you have to pay a brokerage fee, such 
fees will eat up any gain. 

43
• 
A second retort to momentum being evidence of inefficiency is 
that the excess return from the momentum strategy is really not 
excessive. Rather, the return is fair compensation for risk. While 
the momentum strategy is seemingly innocuous in terms of risk, the 
retort claims that it actually has you load up on risk. The argument 
is that the mechanics of the strategy result in the selection of a  
risky portfolio. 
• 
The idea starts from the position that over 6 months, the mean 
returns on securities are not negligible. Unlike at the daily level 
(where we ignored mean returns), a 6-month return may be big 
enough that variation in mean returns across stocks may matter. 
• 
If markets are efficient, then those securities that have more risk 
should have higher average returns than those that have less risk. 
What will you get when you sort stocks on the basis of their 
past returns? Although the label of “winners” for the top 10% of 
securities indicates a set of securities that have “won,” perhaps 
these are just securities that have a bunch of risk. The reason they 
are in the winner portfolio is because, due to their higher average 
return, they would have fairly higher return anyway. 
• 
The bottom 10% returning may simply be securities that are not 
very risky on average; thus, their average return is relatively small. 
A portfolio that is long really risky securities and short low-risk 
securities has more than the average amount of risk. Because the 
risk of this strategy is riskier than holding the market, then this 
strategy will generate higher returns than the market on average. 
• 
It is kind of difficult to confirm or dispute the possibility that 
momentum returns are just compensation for risk. That’s because 
it is difficult to measure risk. If we had a sure way to measure risk, 
then we could see if the winner portfolio is actually riskier than 
the loser portfolio. Researchers have examined this using a set of 
standard asset pricing models to define risk, and they have found 
that risk explains very little of the extra return. 

44
Lecture 6: Evidence on Efficient Markets
Volatility Anomalies
• 
A different type of evidence regarding market efficiency concerns 
the volatility of stock returns. The EMH states that the arrival of 
new (i.e., unanticipated) information will create changes in the 
value of securities. The changes in prices reflect change in the 
state of knowledge about the future. Thus, the variation in price 
changes must be related to the arrival of information. In addition, 
if the markets are going to send signals regarding where to allocate 
resources, then the information price reflected should only be 
relevant to fundamental value. 
• 
There are two types of phenomena that would be very disturbing 
with respect to the EMH. First, it would be disturbing if the amount 
of variation in prices or returns were not plausibly related to the 
arrival of relevant information regarding fundamental value. If 
markets were too volatile or not volatile enough, both would  
be bad. 
• 
A second thing to look at is whether price changes are permanent or 
temporary. If markets are efficient, then any price changes caused 
by the arrival of new information should be permanent in the sense 
that they will not be reversed on average. If, on average, some 
reaction is reversed, then the markets must be overreacting. 
• 
One way to examine the appropriateness of volatility is to compare 
short-run versus long-run volatility. If price changes are permanent 
(i.e., they are not reversed on average), then the amount of variation 
in price changes over two days should be pretty close to twice that 
over one day. If, however, there is overreaction to some information 
that arrives that is eventually corrected, then we would expect to 
see the variance of prices over 10 days, for example, to be less than 
10 times the variance over a single day. 
• 
Researchers have compared short-term versus long-term variance 
and have found that, in fact, the variance of price changes over 
longer intervals of time (for example, over five years) seems too 

45
small relative to the variance of price changes over shorter intervals 
(for example, over a year) to be consistent with market efficiency. 
That is, it seems that the amount of variance in the market in the 
short run is too high. 
• 
The idea is that, in the short run, prices fluctuate too much either 
due to investors’ reactions to things that are not ultimately relevant 
or due to overreactions to things that are relevant. Either way, this 
implies that prices deviate from the fundamental values of the 
securities in significant ways in the short run. Thus, someone who 
has a strong sense of the fundamental value of a security should 
be able to make an excess return by buying low and selling high 
(relative to fundamental value). 
• 
Some very interesting evidence on this “excess volatility” notion 
at shorter intervals was also discovered while considering the 
difference between trading-time versus elapsed-time volatility. 
Studies in the 1980s compared the variance of returns over two 
types of intervals: from market open to market close (i.e., during 
the day) and from market close to market open (i.e., overnight). 
• 
While the number of hours in each interval has changed periodically, 
the open-to-close interval is always much shorter than the overnight 
close-to-open interval. When researchers compared the open-to-
close variance with the close-to-open variance, they found that 
the variance from open to close was many times larger than the 
variance from close to open. Thus, we would expect the bulk of 
the variance to happen when markets are open. This is completely 
consistent with market efficiency.
• 
However, there is some really interesting evidence that is counter 
to the EMH that comes from a paper by Ken French and Richard 
Roll. Their result is that the variance of returns or price changes are 
more related to trading than the flow of information during normal 
business hours. 

46
Lecture 6: Evidence on Efficient Markets
Efficient Explanation
• 
An alternative hypothesis is that the information that gets reflected 
in prices is relevant to fundamental value, but the market itself 
facilitates aggregating people’s potentially disparate views on the 
implications of that information. That is, the market process itself 
may serve to come up with a consensus view on the implications of 
new information. Without the market process that produces prices, 
it is difficult to know what the information means. 
• 
If the market does serve the useful purpose of aggregating the value 
implications of new (relevant) information, then that might explain 
the French-Roll results. If the market is closed on Wednesday, 
perhaps it takes longer than the time during Thursday’s market for 
the market to form that consensus. If so, then the drop in volatility is 
simply because there is less information conveyed by the market—
because the market is not open enough time to fully convey  
that information. 
• 
This is both good and bad news. It suggests that the market is 
actually doing something useful; it not only reflects relevant 
information, but it also conveys relevant information. That’s good. 
The bad part is that it takes longer than a day for it to do that. That 
is not too bad, but it does indicate that if you have a superior idea 
on fundamental value, then you may have a window of opportunity 
(at least a day) in which to exploit your superior view. 
Track Record of Professionals
• 
Given these results, it appears that prices may be wrong for a while. 
The question, then, is whether you or others can effectively exploit 
this fact. For this, there is a significant body of literature that examines 
the ability of professional fund managers to “beat the market.” 
• 
Professionals spend all day looking for and exploiting market 
inefficiencies. Because they spend a significant amount of time and 
resources on such activities, they might be able to beat the market. 
The evidence on this is fairly clear: On average, professional fund 
managers do not beat the market.

1.	 Do you think that markets are too volatile? Do you think the market is 
volatile because it overreacts to information on average or because it 
simply reacts to things that are really relevant? 
2.	 Various markets throughout the world have circuit breakers that prevent 
prices from moving too much in one day; when prices move sufficiently 
far to trigger the circuit breaker, the markets close for a period of time. 
Many people believe that on those days in which a circuit breaker is 
triggered, the circuit breaker impedes investors’ ability to trade at 
efficient prices that would exist if the markets were to remain open. 
Would you feel more or less comfortable trading in a market with such 
circuit breakers? Why or why not?

Lecture 7: Valuation Formulas
Valuation Formulas
Lecture 7
I
n this lecture, you will examine one of the most basic building blocks of 
any financial valuation method—namely, the concept of the time value 
of money. From this, you will obtain various formulas for present value, 
future value, and net present value. With these concepts, and their formulas, 
you will be able to calculate a number of values of interest, including how 
much money you need to save for retirement given an expected return on 
your investments, the value of a bond, and the value of a stock.
The Time Value of Money
• 
The time value of money is a concept that is fundamental to finance 
in that it allows us to compare cash flows that arrive at different 
points in time. The time value of money is at the center of any 
investment decision because you are always deciding whether it 
makes sense to pay the market price for a security now in order to 
get something (usually uncertain) in the future. 
The time value of money allows for the comparison of cash flows that arrive at 
different points in time.

49
• 
The concept of the time value of money is the notion that, for 
most people, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. 
Consider how you would react if someone were to offer to sell you 
a promise to pay you a dollar a year from now. You would probably 
be willing to pay less than a dollar for this promise. 
• 
This difference manifests itself in financial markets as a positive 
interest rate. The interest rate is the fraction of the initial amount 
paid you get extra for giving up that amount today. If you paid 95 
cents to get a dollar in a year, then the annual interest rate is 5/95 = 
0.0526 (or 5.26%). You get 5 cents more than the 95 cents you paid. 
Because 5 cents is 5.26% of 95 cents, the interest rate is 5.26%. 
• 
There are many other names for the interest rate, including the 
discount rate, the opportunity cost of capital, the required rate of 
return, and the capitalization rate. They all mean the same thing.
• 
The notion of the time value of money gives rise to two formulas. 
The first is the future value formula; the second is the present value 
formula. In terms of the timing convention we will use throughout 
the course, we will say that payments occur at specific times relative 
to the current period, which we will denote by t = 0. We will count 
time relative to the current period in years. Thus, one year later is 
t = 1, while four-and-a-half years from now is t = 4.5. Exactly one 
year ago is denoted by t = −1. 
• 
Consider a specific cash flow in the current period (CF0). The future 
value formula translates CF0 into its equivalent future value after t 
years given an annual interest rate. Let the future value after t years 
be denoted FVt, and let the annual interest rate be denoted by r. 
• 
To do this translation, we take the current cash flow CF0 and 
multiply it by the quantity (1 plus the interest rate) for each year 
until we get to the target future date. That is, after one year, the 
future value is CF0(1 + r). After another year, that value grows to 
CF0(1 + r)(1 + r). After t years, the CF0 has grown to its future 
value: FVt = CF0(1 + r)t.

• 
The notion of the present value simply puts the future value notion 
on its head. If someone were to promise you a cash flow CFt in 
t years from now, you would view that promise as equivalent to 
CFt/(1 + r)t now. This is true because, according to the future value 
formula, you can take this current amount and generate (CFt/(1 + r)t) 
(1 + r)t in the future. Notice that (CFt/(1 + r)t)(1 + r)t is simply CFt, 
which is the amount you were promised at t. Thus, a cash flow of 
CFt t years in the future is worth CFt/(1 + r)t now.

• 
The future value CFt promised is discounted to get a present value 
in the sense that it is multiplied by a number (1/(1 + r))t, which is 
less than 1. The more years into the future, the greater the discount. 
That is, over t years, the future value is multiplied by (1/(1 + r))t. 
As the time into the future gets bigger, the present value is a smaller 
fraction of the future value. Thus, the discount is larger. Also, 
the greater the interest rate r, the greater the discounting (i.e., the 
smaller the fraction (1/(1 + r))t).

Value Additivity
• 
These methods described can be applied to a set of multiple 
payments because of something called value additivity, which 
implies that the present value of a collection of future payments, 
with each individual payment at a different future date, is simply 
the sum of the individual present values associated with each of the 
different future payments. 
• 
Put more simply, value additivity is the notion that the whole 
is worth the sum of its parts. While this may not be true for 
nonfinancial things (such as a marriage, a corporation comprised 
of synergistic divisions, or a work of art), it is true for financial 
securities and cash flows. 
• 
Given value additivity, we can calculate the present value of a 
stream of cash flows. Let the stream be denoted by (CFt1, CFt2, CFt3, 
… , CFtT), where CFt1 denotes the first cash flow, which occurs at 

52
Lecture 7: Valuation Formulas
time t1 (in years); CFt2 is the second cash flow, which occurs at 
time t2 (in years); and on up to CFtT , which is the terminal (or last) 
cash flow, occurring at time tT. According to value additivity, the 
present value of this stream is simply the following.

Net Present Value
• 
The net present value (NPV) is calculated to evaluate the quality of 
an investment. Whether it is an investment in a financial security 
or an investment in real assets, such as a project in a corporation 
or privately owned business, the key feature of most investments is 
that you have to spend something to get future cash flows. The net 
present value is the difference between the present value of what 
you get and the present value of what you have to spend to get it. 
That is, it is the net of the present values. 
• 
Because what you spend is typically known with certainty and 
is spent now, that value is not discounted. That is the cost of the 
investment. If you are investing in a financial security, it is the 
price of the security now. If you are investing in a project for a 
corporation, it is the cost of starting that project now. 
• 
The NPV of an investment is simply the present value of the future 
cash flows from the investment minus its cost. If the NPV is positive, 
then your investment gives you a stream of future payments that is 
worth more than what you paid; that’s a good investment. If the 
NPV is negative, then what you get is worth less than what you 
have to pay; that’s clearly a bad investment. 
Special Cases
• 
In some cases, the payments from a security or a real investment 
have a fixed structure. In some of these cases, there are special 
formulas that simplify the calculation of the present value of the 
stream. For example, some investments generate a stream of equal 
cash flows at regular and identical time intervals. 

53
• 
For example, any fixed rate, fixed term loan is like this; the 
borrower pays a fixed amount every month for 60 months (or 5 
years). A rental agreement or lease is also like this. The renter pays 
a fixed rent every month for the length of the lease. 
• 
Anything that has a stream of equal payments is called an annuity. 
We can still calculate the present value as the sum of present values 
of single sums, but there is a shortcut formula that can be applied. 
We will be able to understand the formula for an annuity if we first 
consider something called a perpetuity. 
Perpetuity
• 
A perpetuity is the generic name for a security that promises a 
fixed payment at evenly spaced intervals forever. In the case of a 
perpetuity, we cannot simply add up the present values of each of 
the future payments because there is an infinite number of these 
payments into the future. However, a result from the mathematics 
of infinite sequences and series actually allows us to come up with 
an analytical formula for this infinite sum. 
• 
The present value of each subsequent payment is smaller than the 
one before. If each present value were the same, then the infinite 
sum would be infinity (the same as the sum of an infinite series 
of 1s). However, because the subsequent present values are smaller 
and smaller, the infinite sum is finite. 
• 
The formula for the present value of a perpetuity that pays $C every 
period with the first payment exactly one period from now and a 
periodic rate r is $C/r. 
Annuity
• 
An annuity is something that pays a fixed payment every period 
for a finite number of periods. If the number of payments is fairly 
small, then you can just calculate the present value of each payment 
and add them up. But if we are talking about a 30-year mortgage, 
then you have to calculate 12 × 30 = 360 individual present values, 
and then add them all up. 

54
Lecture 7: Valuation Formulas
• 
We can use a trick to determine the present value of any annuity that 
comes from value additivity and the fact that an annuity is simply 
perpetuity with the tail cut off. Thus, the value of an annuity is the 
value of perpetuity minus the value of the tail. 
• 
In general, the formula for an annuity is as follows.

Growing Annuities and Perpetuities
• 
The last set of formulas is for both annuities and perpetuities 
in which the payments are not fixed, but are growing at a 
constant rate each period. These are called growing annuities and  
growing perpetuities. 
• 
A growing perpetuity is one in which the periodic payments grow at 
a fixed rate g (where, for example, g = 0.05 is 5% growth rate). If the 
first payment, paid 1 period from now, is C1, then the next payment 

55
is C2 = (1 + g)C1, and the payment after that is C3 = (1 + g)C2 = 
(1 + g)2C1. Given this structure, the present value of this stream is  
1
.

• 
One way to think about this is that, without growth in the payment, 
the future values are discounted; the farther in the future, the greater 
the discount. However, if the cash flows are growing, that offsets 
the discounting. So, think of r − g as the net amount of discounting 
given the growth in the cash flows. 
• 
Note, however, that if the growth is equal to or is outstripping the 
discounting—if g is equal to or greater than r—then the growth 
outpaces the discounting. In that case, the infinite sum is actually 
infinity. When g is greater than or equal to r, then the formula 
generates a bogus answer; it generates a negative number, when the 
answer is in fact positive infinity. 
• 
When the stream of payments lasts for t years, it is known as a 
growing annuity. The formula for that is

2.	 If you do not know anything about the interest on 1-year deposits at 
your bank, how much would you be willing to pay now to get $100 
in 1 year? What discount rate did you apply? Was your discount rate 
based on impatience, an expectation of inflation, both, or something  
else entirely? 
3.	 The value of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is simply the present value 
of the fixed monthly payments discounted using the monthly interest 
rate. Similarly, you can determine the monthly payments associated 
by borrowing $500,000 by finding the value of X such that the present 
value of X every month for the next 30 × 12 = 360 months is equal to 
$500,000. At any point in time, the remaining principle the borrower 
owes is simply the present value of the remaining payments at the 
interest rate quoted when the loan was made. If the interest rate is  
0.3 % per month (for an annual effective rate of (1.003)12 − 1 = 0.0366 
or 3.66%), what is the monthly payment on a $500,000 30-year monthly 
payment loan?

hen most people think of investing, they think of stocks. But what 
about the bond market—the market for fixed income? In terms 
of sheer size, the money in fixed income dominates the amount 
of money tied up in equity or stock by about 5 to 1 in the United States. In 
this lecture, you will learn how to price bonds given an interest rate. You will 
also learn how the interest rates on bonds are quoted. 
Bonds
• 
A “plain vanilla” bond is defined by the following features: maturity 
(the final date of the last promised payment), face value (the 
principal due at maturity), coupon rate (the percent of the face value 
that is the annual payment), and payment frequency (the number of 
times over which the annual payment is made). 
• 
“Plain vanilla” refers to the structure of payments that will be 
discussed in this lecture—that is, the structure defined by the 
maturity, face value, coupon rate, and payments per year. There are 
many bonds that have the basic bond structure but also have some 
bells and whistles added on. 
• 
A zero coupon bond is a special case in which the coupon rate is 
zero; it promises only one future payment equal to the face value at 
maturity. An example of a zero coupon bond is a U.S. treasury bill, 
which is a bond issued by the U.S. Treasury with a maturity less 
than a year. 
• 
The price (or market value) of a zero coupon bond is simply the 
present value (PV) of that single payment at maturity. That is, price
=

(1
)T
FV

 where FV is the face value, r is the appropriate 
annualized discount rate, and T is the number of years into the 
future when the bond matures and pays FV.

58
Lecture 8: Bond Pricing
• 
For a zero coupon bond, the price is always less than its face value 
when interest rates are positive. Thus, sometimes these instruments 
are referred to as pure discount instruments, because they always 
sell at a discount to the face value. 
• 
Most bonds pay a positive coupon. In addition, most bonds (either 
corporate debt or government debt) pay the annual coupon in 2 
installments, one every 6 months. For these bonds, the coupons paid 
every 6 months are the coupon rate multiplied by the face value 
of the bond divided by 2. The last coupon paid is when the bond 
matures; at that maturity date, the bond also pays its face value. 
• 
For example, consider a 4% coupon bond that makes coupon 
payments twice a year and matures in 10 years. A timeline might 
show payments of $20 every 6 months with a final payment of 
$1020, which is the face value plus the final $20 coupon.
• 
If the appropriate interest rate is an annualized effective 3%, then 
we can determine the price by taking the present value (using that 
rate) of this stream. This raises the first messy issue with bonds. The 
3% is an annualized effective rate. What does that mean? What is 
the alternative to an annualized effective rate?
• 
This issue has to do with how we discount payments received at 
6-month intervals. There are two things we could do. First, we could 
just use 0.03/2 to be the 6-month rate and, using that 6-month rate, 
discount each cash flow back by the number of 6-month periods that 
payment is in the future. That is, the present value of the first $20 
payment is simply $20/1.015 = $19.70443; similarly, the present 
value of the second $20 coupon is $20/(1.015)2 = $19.41323. 
• 
The second thing we could do instead is to use the annual 3% rate 
and count time in years. With this approach, the present value of the 
first $20 coupon is $20/(1.03)0.5 = $19.70659; the second payment 
(at a year from now) is $20/(1.03) = $19.41748. 

59
• 
Although the differences are minor, they will add up, especially 
when we have 20 coupon payments for a 10-year bond. These 
differences are due to compounding. The first method is consistent 
with the 6-month rate being 1.5% (or half of 3%). The greater the 
stated rate or the number of years, the present value is a smaller 
fraction of the future payment. 
• 
You should think of the differences as just resulting from a 
difference in the convention used for quoting rates. Although the 
effective rate tells you something about what you pay if you are 
borrowing or what you get if you are lending, there may be some 
good reasons to use a noneffective rate when quoting rates. 
• 
Let’s go back to pricing the 10-year 4% semiannual paying coupon 
bond. In general, if the effective periodic rate is r%, the face value 
is FV, the coupon rate is c, the number of compounding periods is K 
per year, and T is the time to maturity, then the price of such a bond 
is given by the following formula.

• 
If you have an annualized stated rate with compounding frequency 
equal to the frequency of the payments, then all you have to do to 
get rk is simply divide the stated rate by the number of compounding 
periods. If the payment frequency is different than the compounding 
frequency used to define the annualized stated rate, then convert the 
stated rate to an annualized effective rate (re ) first. 
• 
For example, if the stated rate is 4% compounded continuously, then 
the effective rate is Exp(0.04) − 1 = 0.040811 (or 4.0811%). Then, 
use this effective annual rate to convert to an effective period rate 
according to the payment frequency on the bond. So, if the payment 
frequency is twice a year, then the right rate to use in the formula 
is

• 
Note that the first part of the formula is just the formula for  
the present value of an annuity. The coupons are an annuity  
that pays the annual coupon rate divided by the number  
of compounding periods times the FV every K periods per year  
over all of the years—for a total of TK periods. That is, we have  
10 × 2 = 20 $20 payments. 
• 
In order to use the standard annuity formula, we need 
the effective 6-month rate. Let’s price the bond as if the  
effective annual rate is 3%, for example. Then, the 6-month rate 
is simply

Using the formula, the present value of the coupons is $343.75. 
And the present value of the face value is simply $744.096. Thus, 
the whole bond is worth $343.749 + $744.096 = $1087.845. 
• 
One of the reasons bond rates may not be quoted in effective 
terms can be seen in the following example. Consider the price of 
a standard plain vanilla 4% coupon semiannual paying bond that 
matures in 10 years. What is the price of this bond if the stated rate 
is the same as the coupon rate and is compounded as frequently as 
the coupon is paid (in this case, twice a year)? Then, the periodic 
effective 6-month rate is 0.04/2 = 0.02. Plugging that into the 
formula, we get a price for this bond at $1000. 
• 
Such a bond is said to sell at par. That is, when the bond sells for 
its face value, it is a par bond. In this case, if you buy the bond, it 
is as if you are lending the firm $1000 now (i.e., the price you paid 
for the bond), and in exchange, you get 6 months of interest every 
6 months (i.e., $20) until, after 10 years has passed, you get your 
original loaned amount back. That is, the coupons pay you enough 
interest to compensate you for lending the $1000 in the first place. 
Thus, when they pay you back, they don’t owe you any more than 
you lent originally. The coupons cover your time value. 
• 
Notice that if we used an effective annual rate of 4%, then the 
periodic rate would be (1.04)0.5 − 1 = 0.019804, which is less than 
2%. If that was the competitive rate, then you would have to pay 
more than $1000 to get the $20 interest and the $1000 back after 10 
years. In fact, the price is $1111.30. This makes sense because with 
an effective annual rate of 4%, the return is less than with a stated 
4% annual rate compounded semiannually. Thus, with the lower 
effective rate, for the same fixed payments in the future, you just 
pay more. 
• 
The convention is to quote the rates on bonds that pay coupons 
semiannually as the stated rate based on compounding twice a year. 
That is, the stated rate is twice the effective 6-month rate. If rates 
are quoted in that way, then if the stated rate is equal to the coupon 

62
Lecture 8: Bond Pricing
rate, the price of the bond sells at par. If the stated rate exceeds 
the coupon rate, then the bond will sell at a discount (i.e., it is a 
discount bond); by paying less to get the same stream of future 
payments, you get a bigger return. And if the stated rate is less than 
the coupon rate, the bond sells at a premium (it is a premium bond).
Yield to Maturity
• 
So far, we have looked at what the price would be given an interest 
rate. Actually, what happens in the markets is that investors decide 
how much they are willing to pay for something, and then the 
financial press reports a rate that is consistent with that price. The 
rate they report is something called a yield to maturity (YTM). 
• 
A yield to maturity is a special case of something referred to as an 
internal rate of return (IRR), which is a general concept that doesn’t 
just apply to bonds. It also applies to any investment. The IRR is 
the rate such that when that rate is applied to the cash flows for any 
project, the net present value of that project is zero. 
• 
In most cases, you can think of an IRR as a breakeven value of 
interest. In most cases, if the interest rate in the market for a project 
is less than the IRR for that project, then when you use the market 
rate to discount the cash flows, the project will be positive NPV. If 
the market rate of interest is greater, then the NPV will be negative. 
• 
Thus, the IRR is the dividing line (in terms of interest rate) between 
the project being good (i.e., positive NPV) or bad (negative NPV). 
If the cash flow stream has both positive and negative values, then 
there are some odd cases in which an increase in the discount rate 
might actually raise the NPV—and a decrease in the discount rate 
might lower the NPV. This doesn’t happen with bonds because the 
cash flows on a bond are always positive. 

63
• 
The yield to maturity is the IRR on the project buying the bond at 
its current market price and holding it to maturity. Thus, it is the 
return you get when you pay the current price and hold it until it 
matures. The YTM is kind of an average of returns over all the 
years until maturity.

The Term Structure of Interest Rates
Lecture 9
I
n this lecture, you will learn how to glean information about the future 
from yield curves. You will examine the yield curve and the term structure 
of interest rates. First, you will learn what a yield curve is. Second, you 
will examine how to use the yield curve to determine the present values of a 
series of future expected cash flows. Third, you will examine the information 
content of the yield curve. 
Yield Curves
• 
So far, we have considered present and future value calculations 
given a single interest rate. However, there are many interest 
rates; rates often differ because they correspond to very different 
borrowing/lending activities. 
• 
A yield curve is simply a plot of the relationship between yields 
to maturity and time to maturity. With any yield curve, time to 
maturity is across the horizontal axis; yield to maturity is on the 
vertical axis. 
• 
The term structure of interest rates refers to the structure or the 
shape of the relationship between yields and time to maturity. 
• 
You are going to see how current rates relate to future rates. There 
are two types of markets. One market is one in which people trade 
bonds that mature in the future for delivery now. This is referred 
to as the spot market. There are other markets where people trade 
contracts for trades in the future. These are the markets for forwards 
or futures contracts. 
• 
Most yield curves are based on the prices of zero coupon bonds. For 
example, the yield to maturity for the 10-year time to maturity is the 
yield for a bond that makes a single payment in 10 years. 

65
• 
You can have a yield curve based on the yield of nonzero coupon 
bonds. The zero coupon yield curve is cleaner because it reflects for 
any given time to maturity just the rate for lending or borrowing for 
just that length of time. 
• 
The yields on a zero yield curve plot are obtained from the market 
prices of zero coupon bonds. Specifically, for a given price per $100 
in face value, the yield ( y) for a given time to maturity (t years) is 
simply the rate that solves the following equation.

effective rate. 
• 
Typically, yields increase with time to maturity. That is, a typical 
term structure is one in which the yield curve is upward sloping. 
• 
To keep things simple, let’s consider a hypothetical yield curve for 
zero coupon bonds that mature in 1, 2, and 3 years. Let’s say that 
the yield on the 1-year zero is 0.04 (or 4%); with such a yield, a 
$1000 face value 1-year zero would sell for $961.54. 
• 
Let’s say that the yield on the 2-year zero is 0.06 (or 6%); with 
that yield, the price of a $1000 face value 2-year zero would be  
$1000/(1.06)2 = $890.00. 
• 
Finally, let’s say that the yield on the 3-year zero is 0.07 (7%), 
implying the price per $1000 in face value is $816.30. 

66
Lecture 9: The Term Structure of Interest Rates
• 
Because the 3-year yield is bigger than the 2-year rate, which is 
bigger than the 1-year yield, the yield curve has the more typical 
upward slope. 
• 
Next, let’s consider how you might use the yields for zero coupon 
bonds to price nonzero coupon bonds. By value additivity, the 
present value of a stream of payments—for example, the coupons 
and face value on a coupon-paying bond—is simply the sum of the 
present values of each of the separate parts of the stream. 
• 
So, let’s consider a simple bond that has a face value of $1000 and 
pays an annual 5% coupon only once a year that matures in 3 years. 
The cash flows on this bond are 0.05 × $1000 = $50 at t = 1, another 
$50 at t = 2, and then the face value (of $1000) plus the final $50 
coupon payment for a total payment of $1050 at t = 3. 
• 
To figure out the value of this coupon bond, we need to figure out 
the present value of each of its payments. What is the present value 
of the first $50 coupon payment at t = 1 year? For this, we can use 
the yield curve for zeros. For that yield curve, we know that the 
value of $1000 in one year is $961.54. 
• 
Given that, what must be the value of $50 in one year? Because  
$50 is 5% of $1000, then $50 in a year must be worth exactly  
5% on the value of $1000 in a year. That is, $50 in a year is worth 
0.05 × 961.54 = $48.077. 
• 
Equivalently, $50 in a year is just $50 discounted back using the 
1-year yield off the zero yield curve. That is, the present value of 
$50 in a year is $50/(1 + 0.04)1 = $48.077. You get the same answer. 
• 
To get the present value for the whole stream of payments on the 
coupon-paying bond, simply discount each of the payments from 
that bond at the zero yield that corresponds to when each payment 
is made. Then, add up all of the individual present values. The 
result is $949.69.

67
Why a Given Shape?
• 
A typical term structure is an upward-sloping yield curve. Why 
is that typical? To understand why, consider how you would feel 
investing in zeros with different times to maturity. If you invest in 
a bond with a long time to maturity, you are implicitly “tying your 
money up” for long time. If you invest in a shorter-term bond, you 
are implicitly tying your money up for less time. As a result, you 
may need a greater return to induce you to implicitly tie your money 
up for longer periods of time. Thus, the yield will increase with 
time to maturity. 
• 
The term “implicitly” is stressed because you personally are not 
forced to tie your money up until maturity. You do not have to hold 
a 10-year bond for 10 years; rather, you can sell it to someone else 
prior to maturity if you need liquidity. 

68
Lecture 9: The Term Structure of Interest Rates
• 
However, the person you sell it to will either have to hold it to 
maturity or will have to sell early to someone who will either have 
to hold it to maturity or find someone else to sell it, too—until there 
is some last person who will hold it to maturity. So, even though 
you do not have to hold it to maturity, somebody will have to. 
• 
Thus, the rate at the time you buy it is based on what people are 
willing to pay given that someone must hold it to maturity. Because 
someone is tying their money up for a longer period of time, the 
return per year demanded is typically higher, making the yield 
curve slope upward. The extra return is called a term premium.
• 
In some cases, however, the yield curve can be downward sloping. 
That is, the yields on longer-term treasuries are lower than those for 
shorter-term treasuries. To highlight that this is not typical, this is 
called an inverted yield curve.

69
• 
Let’s see why the shape of the yield curve might tell us something 
about the future. Suppose that your investment horizon is 2 years. 
Let t = 0, and let your end point be t = 2. 
• 
Consider two ways to get a return over 2 years. The first way is 
to invest in the 1-year zero at the 1-year yield of 4%; then, when 
the zero matures at t = 1, roll over the amount you get at maturity 
into another 1-year investment (one that matures at t = 2). Let’s call 
this the rollover strategy. The second way is to directly invest in the 
2-year zero at the annual 6% yield. Let’s call this the direct strategy. 
• 
Note that for the rollover strategy, you have some uncertainty 
about what the 1-year rate will be next year. If you could know 
next year’s 1-year rate for sure, what would it have to be to make 
you indifferent between these two strategies? The answer to that 
question is called the forward rate.
• 
Note that for the direct strategy, per dollar invested, you will get 
$1(1.06)2 = $1.1236 after 2 years. If you do the rollover strategy, 
each dollar you invest will grow to $1(1.04) = $1.04 after 1 year (to 
t = 1). Then, take that amount and invest at the 1-year rate available 
at t =1 for 1 more year. 
• 
At t = 1, there will be many 1-year zeros that you can invest in.  
For example, there may be a zero that was initially issued with a 
time to maturity of 10 years that at t = 1 is 9 years old; thus, it 
matures at t = 2. There may be a new zero issued that matures in 1 
year (at t = 2). Because all of these zeros just make a single payment 
at t = 2, the rates on all of these will be the same. The rate will be 
reflected on the yield curve at t = 1. 
• 
Specifically, on the t = 1 yield curve, the rate will be that which is 
associated with a time to maturity of 1 year. Let’s call this rate r11, 
for the rate on a 1-year zero at t = 1. Let the first number be the date 
of the spot market and the second number be the time to maturity.

Lecture 9: The Term Structure of Interest Rates
• 
What does that rate have to be for the rollover strategy to generate 
the same 2-year return as the direct strategy? That is, what is the 
forward rate? The answer is the solution to the following equation: 
(1 + 0.04)(1 + r11) = (1 + 0.06)2.
• 
Thus, the answer is 
2

• 
Thus, if the 1-year rate is 8.0385% next year, then the rollover 
strategy will generate the same 2-year return as the direct 2-year 
strategy. Thus, 8.0385% is the forward rate. 
The Expectations Hypothesis 
• 
For a given expectation in the future, the current yields adjust until 
the forward rates are equal to the market’s expectation of the future 
spot rate. This is the expectations hypothesis—that, in a risk-neutral 
world, forward rates are expectations of future short-term rates. 
• 
If you don’t have a view on what interest rates will be in the future, 
then you can use the yield curve to calculate a series of forward 
rates, and under the interpretation of forward rates as expected 
future rates, these rates will give you a forecast of the market 
consensus view. 
Downward-Sloping Yield Curves 
• 
Periodically, there are downward-sloping yield curves. That is, 
the yield curve is inverted. That means the market expects the 
short-term rates to decline. This is typically associated with the 
expectation of a future recession and very slow economic growth. 
• 
When the economy is in a recession, the Federal Reserve typically 
increases the money supply in order to lower interest rates in the 
hopes that low rates will spur investment and greater economic 
activity. The Fed typically does this by keeping short-term rates 
low. Thus, when the yield curve becomes inverted, the market is 
expecting the Fed to act in this way. 

71
Term Premia
• 
In a risk-neutral world, forward rates are expectations of future spot 
rates. So, why do yield curves typically slope up? Does the market 
always expect short-term rates to rise? And, because they don’t 
always rise and keep on rising, does this mean that the market is 
systematically wrong? 
• 
The answer is that forward rates would have an additional 
component when the market is risk averse that generates a persistent 
upward slope. These additional components are called term premia. 
• 
Term premia come from the fact that longer-term bonds are riskier 
than shorter-term bonds. Thus, term premia reflect the extra risk in 
longer-term bonds. As the term of the bond gets longer, the term 
premia get bigger and bigger. As a result, even if the market expects 
yield curves to say pretty much the same, yield curves will have an 
upward slope, reflecting increasing term premia.

The Risks in Bonds
Lecture 10
T
his lecture will investigate why and how long-term bonds are riskier 
than short-term bonds. Specifically, this lecture will examine two 
things that might happen that increase in likelihood over longer 
intervals of time: defaults and actual (rather than expected) changes in 
interest rates. The first creates default risk while the second creates interest 
rate risk. In this lecture, you will learn about the nature of both types of risk. 
Interest Rate Risk
• 
Consider the following situation: You have a 2-year investment 
horizon and have just purchased a zero coupon bond that matures in 
2 years. The yield to maturity (YTM) on that bond is 4%, that is, the 
yield curve is flat at 4% for all maturities. Thus, per $1000 in face 
value, you paid 
2
$1000
(1.04)
 = $924.5562.
• 
With this zero coupon bond, you don’t get any intervening  
coupons. If you hold it to maturity, then you get the YTM or 
4% for each year. That is, you paid $924.5562, and you get 
$924.5562(1.04)2 = $1000 after two years. Note that in this case, 
even if interest rates fell to zero or skyrocketed, you would still get 
4% annual growth on your initial investment of $924.5562. 
Reinvestment Risk 
• 
Now, consider if you had purchased a 2-year bond that pays a 5% 
annual coupon. If the YTM is the same on all maturities at 4%, then, 
per $1000 in face value, you pay 
1
2
$50
$1050
$1018.861.

(1.04)

• 
Importantly, if the yield curve stays flat at 4% from now until 
maturity and you hold it to maturity, then you will also get 4% on 
your money—as with the 2-year zero. After 1 year, you will get 
$50. At that time, if the yields have not changed, then you will be 

74
Lecture 10: The Risks in Bonds
able to invest that $50 at 4% for another year. That is, $50 at t = 1 
will grow to $50(1.04) = $52 at t = 2. Thus, at t = 2, you will have 
that $52 plus $1050 from the face value and the last coupon, for a 
total of $1102. 
• 
So, you gave up $1018.861 at t = 0 and received $1102 at  
t = 2. That would be equivalent to investing at a rate r such that

• 
What would your return be if the yield curve had shifted down 
to 2%, for example, after 1 year? Then, you would have paid 
$1018.861, but you would have received after 2 years only  
$1050 + $50(1.02) = $1101; then, this is equivalent to receiving a 
return of

 − 1 = 0.0395 = 3.95% (as opposed to 4%). 
• 
So, even though the YTM when you purchased the bond was 4% 
and you held it to maturity, you didn’t receive that 4%. That’s 
because the yield when you reinvested the coupon had changed 
from the original YTM. Of course, no such problem exists with a 
zero coupon bond, because you have no coupons to reinvest. 
• 
With coupon bonds, you face what is referred to as reinvestment 
risk, which occurs when your investments have some cash flows 
that occur at a shorter horizon than your investment horizon (for 
example, the t = 1 coupon in this example). 
Price Risk 
• 
Reinvestment risk is one of two kinds of interest rate risk. The other 
kind is price risk, which refers to the change in the value of a bond 
as a result of a change in yields. This occurs when you invest in 
securities that are longer term than your investment horizon. 

75
• 
Depending on a bond’s time to maturity relative to your investment 
horizon, bonds that pay coupons will have both reinvestment risk 
and price risk. To understand price risk as clearly as possible, let’s 
consider an example in which there is no reinvestment risk; these 
examples consider zero coupon bonds. 
• 
Let’s say that the current yield curve is flat at 2% for all maturities. 
Let’s say that you want to invest for 5 years and are considering the 
following three strategies: buy a 5-year zero, buy a 10-year zero 
and sell it at the end of the 5 years, or buy a 15-year zero and sell it 
at the end of 5 years.
• 
The returns on the last two investments are uncertain because the 
prices of the current 10- and 15-year zeros 5 years from now (when 
they will be 5- and 10-year zeros, respectively) are unknown now. 
• 
If you invest $1,000,000 in the 5-year zero, you will get 2% because 
that is the YTM and you will hold it until maturity. What will you 
get if you invest $1,000,000 in the 10-year zero now but sell it after 
5 years? 
• 
The holding period yield (HPY) is defined as the yield that, when 
applied to the realized cash flows, makes your investment a zero net 
present value (NPV) investment. That is, the HPY is the internal 
rate of return you realized on your investment in that bond. Notice 
that the HPY can only be calculated ex post, once you know what 
you sold the bond for at the end of your holding period. Given the 
cash flows you actually received, when you discount at the holding 
period yield, the result is the price you paid for the security.
• 
If the yields don’t change, then the holding period yield for the 
longer-term zero will be the same as your original yield to maturity. 
Similarly, if the yield curve stays flat at 2% and you invest in the 
15-year zero, your holding period yield over 5 years will be 2%, 
too. Thus, the maturity of the bond has no influence on your HPY, 
provided that the yields don’t change—but they do change.

76
Lecture 10: The Risks in Bonds
• 
In that case, is there a difference in the HPY between the three 
bonds? The HPY for the 5-year bond over 5 years is simply its 
original YTM of 2%. Thus, if your horizon is 5 years, then a 5-year 
zero locks in your yield. 
• 
Given shifting yield curves, will there be a difference between the 
10- and 15-year bonds? In both cases, you get less than if you had 
invested in the 5-year zero.
• 
Although the 15-year has a higher HPY when rates fall, you 
typically can’t get the possibility of that upside unless you also face 
the possibility of rates rising. If the current yield curve incorporates 
the market’s view on the expected future level of interest rates, 
then the yield curve is as likely to shift up as down. As a result, the 
holding period yields for longer-term bonds are more variable than 
those of short-term bonds. Thus, long-term zeros are riskier than 
shorter-term zeros. 
Let the current yield curve be flat at 2% for zero coupon bonds:

Let’s say you want to invest for 5 years and are considering the 
following 3 strategies:
1.	
Buy a 5-year zero
2.	
Buy a 10-year zero and sell it at the end of 5 years
3.	
Buy a 15-year zero and sell it at the end of 5 years

What is your HPY if the yield curve shifts up to 4% in 5 years?

$1000 / (1.04)15 = $555.26
When you sell a $1000 face value 10-year zero 5 years later, it is 
worth $1000 / (1.04)5 = $821.93. 
Because you paid $820.35 per $1000 initially, your HPY is:
$820.35 = $821.93 / (1 + HPY)5 → HPY  
= ($821.93 / $820.35)1/5 − 1  
= 0.000385 = .0385% < 2%
You get less than if you had invested in the 5-year zero!
What happens if the yield curve shifts down to 1% at all maturities 
instead?

Lecture 10: The Risks in Bonds
Credit Risk 
• 
Credit risk is the risk that you won’t get all your promised 
payments. Credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s, Standard & 
Poor’s, and Fitch, provide ratings in the form of letter grades that 
specify something about the likelihood of a default. 
• 
Aggregate data on the default experience of a collection of bonds 
by original credit rating is available from Standard & Poor’s and 
academic papers. The typical information that a credit rating agency 
has to summarize credit risk is contained in a matrix of cumulative 
average default rates based on historical data. Such a matrix shows 
the probability of a company defaulting on a security they issued 
within a number of years as a function of that issue’s credit rating. 
• 
A typical matrix is structured as follows (see Table 10.4): Across 
the top are different horizons, measured in number of years. The 
first column is for within 1 year; the second column is for within 
2 years. This extends all the way up to within 10 years. Down the 
side is the credit rating, with the best rating at the top, falling to the 
worst rating at the bottom. 
• 
The numbers in the matrix answer the following question: For a 
bond originally issued at rating X, what is the probability that it 
will default within Y years? By subtracting the entry in the column 
to the immediate left of a given entry within a given row, you can 
determine the probability of an issue of that rating defaulting the 
year corresponding to that column. This is called the incremental or 
marginal probability of default for that year for that original rating. 
• 
The marginal probabilities obtained from a matrix are the answers 
to the following question: For a bond originally issued at rating X, 
what is the probability that it will default in year Y of its life? For 
any given row, corresponding to a given rating at issue, the entries 
in the table increase from left to right. This simply reflects that it is 
more likely that more defaults will occur the longer we wait.

Lecture 10: The Risks in Bonds
• 
What may not be obvious is how the marginal probabilities of 
default change with time to default across ratings levels. Continuing 
down the rows, the incremental probabilities typically continue  
to fall. 
• 
The difference between each adjacent entry gets bigger as you 
move to the right. Thus, the pattern of incremental probabilities for 
higher-rated issues is the opposite of that for lower-rated issues. 
• 
These probabilities are all from the perspective of when the 
bond was issued. That is, they are unconditional probabilities 
in the sense that the probabilities are based solely on the kind of 
information someone would have at the time of the issue. That is, 
these probabilities are based on not knowing any part of an issue’s 
realized experience (e.g., whether they made it through the first 
year or not.) 
• 
However, you might be interested in investing in a bond that has 
been around awhile. Thus, you might want to answer the following 
question: What is the probability that it will default given that it has 
survived so far? This is a conditional probability. 
• 
Although the probabilities in a cumulative default probability 
matrix are unconditional probabilities, they can be used to calculate 
conditional probabilities. Specifically, you can calculate something 
called a default intensity or a hazard rate. Both are defined as the 
probability of a default over a particular year after issue, conditional 
on it not having defaulted yet. 
Recovery Rates and Pricing Default-Prone Bonds 
• 
Once you have these probabilities, you still need some additional 
information to help you figure out what is the value of a risky bond. 
The additional piece of information you need is something called a 
recovery rate.

81
• 
A default triggers a potentially long and drawn out legal process by 
which many people argue about who gets what. Because the firm’s 
assets are unlikely to be worth nothing, the outcome of this process 
is that debt holders will get some fraction of what was promised 
to them. 
• 
The recovery rate is defined as the fraction of the bond’s face value 
that the bond sells at when the default occurs. Recovery rate varies 
across bonds according to their seniority (for example, senior 
secured bonds have priority over junior subordinated bonds). 
• 
For a given recovery rate, you can get an estimate of the market’s 
belief about the likelihood that there will be a default on that bond. 
If there is a positive risk of default for a bond, then that bond will 
have a yield that is bigger than the yield on a similar risk-free bond. 
The difference on the yield on the default-prone bond and the  
risk-free bond is called the credit or default spread. The extra yield 
from the spread compensates the holder for the greater chance  
of a default. 

82
Lecture 10: The Risks in Bonds
• 
Assuming that the world is risk neutral, for a given probability of 
default (P) and a given recovery rate (R), it must be the case that the 
spread (s) is such that s = P(1 − R). That is, per dollar invested, you 
will lose $1 − $R if the default occurs. The extra return per dollar 
invested, which is the spread s, must equal your expected loss. 
Your expected loss is simply P($1 − $R). Thus, the “risk neutral” 
probability of the default is

Quantifying Interest Rate Risk
Lecture 11
T
his lecture will examine a measure of interest rate risk that accounts 
for both reinvestment risk and price risk. In this lecture, you will learn 
how to calculate this measure for an individual bond. You will also 
learn that you can apply the metric to portfolios of bonds as well. While 
you may never actually calculate this metric yourself, you will examine the 
formula so that you know exactly what the metric is—and what it is not. The 
goal of this lecture is to give you an intuitive feel for the features of bonds 
that raise or lower interest rate risk. 
Balance Sheet Risk
• 
A balance sheet (see Table 11.1) is a snapshot at a moment in time 
of the various parts that comprise the assets and liabilities of a firm. 
There are two sides to the balance sheet that, as the name makes 
explicit, must balance. The right-hand side lists all of the liabilities 
that a firm has issued in order to fund its activities.

Firms sell two basic types of liabilities. The first type is fixed 
claims, in which the firm promises to pay back what it borrowed 
plus interest at a set schedule. These claims are debt or bonds. The 
second is residual claims, in which the owners of these claims get 
whatever is left over after all the other claimants are paid. These 
claims are equity. This liability side shows the value of the debt and 
the equity of the firm.

Lecture 11: Quantifying Interest Rate Risk
• 
The left-hand side of the balance sheet measures the value of all 
the assets the firm has or has created with the money it raised by 
issuing the liabilities and selling equity listed on the other side of 
the balance sheet. 
• 
Think of the asset side of the balance sheet as the value of 
everything the firm has purchased, including raw materials, plants 
and equipment, human capital, the infrastructure it has to make and 
sell its products and services, etc. The hope is that the unique and 
creative manner in which the management deploys all these assets 
makes the assets worth more when controlled by the firm than just 
the sum of their individual values alone. 
• 
The value of the equity is simply the difference between what the 
enterprise is worth minus the market value of what is owed on the 
fixed liabilities. That is, the market value of equity (E) is equal to 
the market value of the assets (A) minus the market value of the 
debt liabilities (L). 
• 
Because the balance sheet must balance, we have equity always 
equal to the value of assets minus the value of the debt liabilities:  
E = A − L. Thus, if either the value of A or the value of L changes, 
so does E. That is, the balancing of the balance sheet then implies 
that ∆E = ∆A − ∆L, where ∆ stands for “the change in.”
Asset/Liability Management 
• 
A bank issues a bunch of different types of debt liabilities. For 
example, they issue liabilities in the form of demand deposits. 
These are checking and savings accounts. They are called demand 
deposits because the holder of the liability (i.e., the depositor) can 
get their money back on demand. Thus, these can be very short-
term liabilities. A bank might also issue slightly longer-term debt-
like liabilities, such as 1- to 5-year certificates of deposit. 

85
• 
All of these liabilities have a market value. They are promises the 
bank has made to pay something in the future. As a consequence, 
the market value of these liabilities depends on the position of the 
yield curve. 
• 
The bank takes the deposits and then makes investments—in loans 
to business and loans to people buying homes. These are the assets 
the bank has on its balance sheet. These loans are assets that are 
like investments in the sense that they will be making a series of 
cash flow payments to the bank over time. And these assets have a 
market value. 
• 
An important feature of these investments is that they are typically 
very long term in nature. For example, a 30-year mortgage is 
around a long time. 
• 
Bank and other financial institutions engage in something called 
asset/liability management, which is all about controlling changes 
in equity. Financial institutions have to work at this because, by the 
very nature of their business, they have a mismatch between the 
long-term versus short-term nature of their assets and liabilities. 
• 
For a depository institution, they issue short-term liabilities and 
invest in long-term assets. This means that the asset side and the 
liability side of the balance sheet have differing sensitivities to 
change in interest rates.
Duration 
• 
Bonds with identical maturities will respond differently to interest 
rate changes when the coupon rates differ. We need a metric that 
considers all of the dimensions of the bond in determining its 
sensitivity. Such a metric is duration. 
• 
Although duration means something in common parlance, it has 
a very specific meaning in fixed income analysis. Duration is the 
elasticity of the bond’s value with respect to a change in the yield to 
maturity of the bond. 

86
Lecture 11: Quantifying Interest Rate Risk
• 
The concept of elasticity is from microeconomics. There, 
economists use elasticity as a unit-less measure of how sensitive 
the demand for a product is to various variables of interest, such 
as the price of the good, the price of a substitute, or the wealth 
of a consumer. In general, elasticity is the percentage change in 
something given a percentage change in something else. Often, 
what matters is whether the elasticity is bigger than, equal to, or 
smaller than 1. 
• 
The duration in fixed income is the elasticity of the price of a bond 
to the change in the yield to maturity. That is, it is defined by the 
following formula.
○

 where P is the price, ∆ is the change in,  
y is the yield, and D is the duration. 
• 
Think of the duration as telling you the magnitude—not the 
direction—of the change. Because the direction of the change in 
the bond price is obvious, we ignore the sign when discussing the 
duration. Thus, durations are always positive. 
• 
Sometimes you will hear someone refer to a Macaulay duration, 
which is the duration that was just defined—i.e., it is the magnitude 
of the percentage change in the price given a percentage change in 
the yield. 
• 
You might also hear someone refer to the modified duration 
of a bond, which is simply the Macaulay duration divided by  
1 plus the current yield. That is, MD = (1
)
D

. If the duration is not 
qualified with a first name, the default is that we are referring to the  
Macaulay duration. 

87
• 
The Macaulay duration implies that

. In words, the 
absolute value of the percent change in the price is the duration 
times the absolute percentage change in the yield, where the percent 
is measured as the change in the yield divided by 1 plus the yield 
(i.e., not the net yield, but the gross yield). 
• 
One of the reasons people use modified duration is because, after 
hitting the expression above with a stick, you get the following 
expression: 
.
P

P

 In words, the percentage change in 
the bond price is equal to the modified duration times the absolute 
change in the yield. That is, the price change is linear in the yield 
change, where the modified duration is the magnitude of the  
linear multiple.
Formula for Duration
• 
The duration of a bond is calculated as the weighted average of 
the times in which the bond makes its payments. The weight for a 
specific time a payment is made is the fraction of the total value of 
the bond that that payment contributes to the total value. 
• 
We have a set of periods in which the bond makes its payments. If 
it pays coupons semiannually, then the first payment will be at t = 
0.5, the second at t = 1, and on up to the maturity—for example, at 
t = 10 (for a 10-year bond). The duration is a weighted average of 
each of these times.
• 
The value of the bond is simply the sum of the present values of 
each of the individual payments. The weight of the first payment 
will be the present value of that payment divided by the value of the 
bond. That is, the weight is the fraction of the total value that that 
first payment contributes to the value of the whole bond. 

88
Lecture 11: Quantifying Interest Rate Risk
• 
For example, if we consider a bond that makes annual payments, let 
CF1 be the first cash flow that occurs at t = 1. Similarly, let CF2 be 
for the cash flow at t = 2. Continue this way until we get to the final 
year (for example, T); the CFT is the final cash flow at t = T. The 
duration is then the following formula.

T, where PV(CFT)  
is the present value of the cash flow at t, t is the period when 
a payment is made, and PV(all) = PV(CF1) + PV(CF2) + … + 
PV(CFT) is the present value of the whole stream of payments.
• 
Because the duration is based on all of the payments, it combines 
the effects of differences in coupon rates and differences in maturity. 
In addition, note that because the duration is a weighted average 
based on values, the duration of a portfolio of bonds is simply the 
weighted average of the durations of each of the individual bonds 
in the portfolio. The weight to be applied to the duration of an 
individual bond is simply the fraction of the portfolio’s value that 
bond represents. 

89
Intuition 
• 
Based on the idea of duration as a weighted average, we can get 
an intuitive feel for what affects the duration of a bond or portfolio  
of bonds. 
• 
Note that for a zero coupon bond, duration equals maturity because 
100% of its present value is generated by the payment of the face 
value, at maturity. For coupon bonds, the duration is less than its 
time to maturity (TTM). There is positive weight on the earlier 
payments. As a result, the average is pulled down relative to what it 
would be with no coupons. 
• 
Holding everything else fixed, as the TTM increases, the duration 
increases. In addition, as the coupon rate increases, the duration 
falls. Less intuitive is what happens to the duration when the yields 
are high versus low. 

90
Lecture 11: Quantifying Interest Rate Risk
• 
Under which situation would you be more worried about losing 
your value? Would you lose more value given a percentage increase 
in yields in the high- or the low-yield cases? Use your intuition that 
duration is the weighted average. As the yields increase, how are 
the weights reallocated over the times of the payments? 
• 
As the yields increase, the payments that are farther out are worth 
relatively less because they are discounted at a higher rate. As a 
result, the weights on later periods are smaller when yields are 
higher versus when yields are lower. This means that, holding 
everything else fixed, the duration is smaller when yields are higher. 
Thus, when yields are low, the duration is higher. As a result, a 
given percentage increase in yields will result in a much larger drop 
in the value of the bond in a low-interest-rate environment.

Value Creation and Stock Prices
Lecture 12
I
n this lecture, you will start the process of understanding risk. The lecture 
will examine the basic notion of value in a corporate setting. Then, given 
this notion, you will examine where risk might reside. In particular, you 
will examine how the risk gets allocated among the claimants of the firm on 
the balance sheet. You will examine the weighted average cost of capital. 
You will also learn how the structure of the financing of the firm—that is, the 
firm’s capital structure—affects who bears the risk in the firm. 
NPV and Value 
• 
The value of a firm as an entity derives solely from its ability to 
transform a bunch of stuff worth X into some other stuff that is 
worth more than X. The firm’s management adds value only if the 
present value of the expected cash flows exceeds the certain value 
paid for the input. This difference is known as the net present  
value (NPV).
• 
The only way to get a positive NPV is by buying stuff for X that 
generates future and uncertain cash flows that are, in present value 
terms, worth more than X. If it doesn’t, then what the firm does is 
not worth doing. 
• 
What does NPV have to do with the stock price of these companies? 
Stock is just one source of money for management; it represents 
only one kind of claim to the cash flows of the firm. The structure 
of the claims issued to raise money to fund the projects that produce 
future cash flows is extremely important for understanding the risks 
of each of the securities you might buy. 
• 
In general, there are two basic types of financial instruments or 
contracts that are issued to raise money to fund a firm’s activities: 
stocks or equity (ownership) and bonds or debt (borrowing  
and lending).

92
Lecture 12: Value Creation and Stock Prices
• 
A bond is a fixed-income instrument in which the seller promises 
the buyer a set of fixed payments. Bond owners have no control 
rights, but they have priority over equity. Bond owners face default 
risk and interest rate risk. 
• 
In contrast to bonds, a stock (or equity) is partial ownership in a 
company. As such, equity holders get what is left over after the 
firm pays all of its bills, including payments to firms and people 
who supply the inputs to the firm’s processes. Once it pays the bills 
for the suppliers and sells what it produces, it makes profits. From 
these profits, the firm must make payments to the debt holders that 
lent them money in the first place to create this venture. 
• 
If there is anything left over after the debt holders are paid, only 
then do the equity holders get anything. Thus, sometimes you will 
hear equity referred to as a “residual claim.” 
• 
In return for getting leftovers, equity holders have control rights; 
that is, they have a say in how the firm is run. Because they get 
what is left over, they want to make sure the management does not 
waste their resources. 
• 
The management of the firm gets the money from selling debt 
and equity and then tries to transform it by creating a unique 
combination of people and capital that will produce profits into the 
indefinite future. 
• 
The cash flows from the transformation created by the firm are 
distributed back to the debt and equity holders. The government 
also gets some in taxes. For this lecture, imagine that there is  
no government. 
• 
Because equity is a residual claim, the return on equity depends 
on the return on the firm’s assets (the whole) and the level of debt 
and other liabilities (the amount of the whole that is promised to 
someone else).

93
Balance Sheet and Value Creation 
• 
A firm’s balance sheet (see figures 12.1–12.4) is a summary of 
the value of the assets and liabilities of the firm. Think of a small 
entrepreneurial start-up; the numbers are in millions (not billions). 
The firm has raised $200 million in capital by selling claims to the 
cash flows from the venture. It has sold debt worth $150 million, 
and the owners of the firm (the entrepreneur and partners) have put 
up $50 million.

• 
Initially, they buy some raw materials (worth $100 million) and 
some equipment (worth $100 million). Given the riskiness of 
this venture, the debt holders require 5% interest. The equity 
holders demand 25% interest. Their returns are going to be 
risky. So, in order to induce them to want to invest, they need to 
get a higher expected return—or else they would invest their  
money elsewhere. 
• 
Let’s say that the debt holders only require 5% because they view 
their claim as risk-free. For now, let’s assume that there is enough 
value in the firm—and there will be enough value in the firm—that 
the firm will always be able to make good on its promises to pay 
back the debt. Thus, it is risk-free debt. 
• 
The weighted average of the two required rates of return is  
(0.75 × 0.05) + (0.25 × 0.25) = 0.10 (or 10%). The weights are the 
relative amount of money raised in each type of security: 75% in 
debt and 25% in equity. 
• 
Often, financial professionals refer to this mix by discussing the 
“debt-to-equity ratio.” In this case, the debt-to-equity ratio is 3 
because the debt is worth 3 times more than the equity. The 10% 
in this example is the firm’s cost of capital. It is the return that 
must be promised to the claimants in order to get them to fund the  
firm’s activities. 

95
• 
Now that the firm has material and equipment, it can transform 
these items into new stuff that will generate future and risky cash 
flows. Let’s say that, on average, the $200 million worth of stuff 
generates an average return of 10%. Then, when we discount back 
the future cash flows the firm generates, what is the value we get? 
• 
What is the risk of the cash flows generated by the firm? In an 
efficient market, it must be such that the discount rate is 10%—
because the debt and equity holders are the ones that collectively 
bear the risk. The bondholders and equity holders get all of the cash 
flows from the company. Thus, if there is any variation in the future 
cash flows, they are the ones that must live with the variation in 
what they get. 
• 
So, if the risk is such that the discount rate is 10% when they bought 
the firm’s liabilities, then we should also discount back the expected 
cash flows from the capital and the ideas of the firm at 10%. And 
if the capital and ideas and management generate a 10% expected 
increase over the initial value of the assets, then the present value 
of the cash flows from the transformation is simply $200 million. In 
that case, the debt holders can get their 5%, and the equity holders 
can get their 25%. 
• 
The market value of the debt is still $150 million, and the market 
value of the equity is still $50 million. No value was added. 
And that’s because the market was efficient; no one made an  
excessive return. 
• 
But what if the market is not efficient? If there was no valuable 
transformation, then the equity holders would have received a 
fair return on 25% even if their $50 million stayed worth $50 
million. In the case of a valuable transformation, the equity 
holders get more than 25%, because they get $3.63 million more in  
present value.

96
Lecture 12: Value Creation and Stock Prices
Capital Structure
• 
Because equity is a residual claim, the value of equity is the value 
of the assets minus the value of the liabilities: E = A − L. If the 
value of A or L changes, then E changes in response. Consider what 
happens if a firm becomes more “levered”—that is, if it increases 
its debt. 
• 
A pure capital structure change is when we simply change the 
capital structure without affecting the assets of the firm. Most 
capital structures changes are also accompanied by investments 
in the firm. If a firm sells some corporate bonds, they increase 
the amount of debt relative to equity, and they take the money 
raised and, for example, develop a new product or expand into a 
new market. If the firm sells equity, it uses the proceeds to build a  
state-of-the-art manufacturing and distribution center. 
• 
When a firm does this kind of investment, two things are changing: 
the capital structure and the portfolio of real projects the firm has. 
• 
Consider a situation in which a firm raises money by issuing 
securities and then immediately pays out the proceeds to retire 
or reduce the amount of another security. The returns on equity 
are levered in the sense that they are more sensitive to the value 
of assets. Thus, the more debt is used to fund the assets, the more 
sensitive the value of equity is to changes in the value of the 
firm. More leverage can make equity have higher returns when 
asset values increase—but also more negative returns when asset  
values fall. 
Cost of Capital 
• 
Let’s consider how the capital structure affects the cost of capital of 
the firm, which is the return that must be promised to the claimants 
in order to get them to fund the firm’s activities. What happens to 
the cost of capital as we change the capital structure? 

97
• 
If the firm is financially sound enough that they will never default 
on a debt claim, then the required rate of return to the debt will 
be the risk-free rate. However, because the shareholders of the firm 
have residual claims, they will require a return that is commensurate 
with the risk of the equity. 
• 
The greater the leverage (i.e., debt), the more sensitive the equity 
is to changes in asset values. And the more sensitive the equity is 
to changes in assets, the more risk. Thus, the required rate of return 
for equity must be increasing in the leverage (i.e., the debt-to-equity 
ratio) of the firm.
• 
In general, the required rate of return on equity re is the following 
function of the required return on debt, the required rate of return 
on the assets, and the debt-to-equity ratio:

Present Value of Growth Opportunities
Lecture 13
I
n this lecture, you will examine how a firm’s growth prospects translate 
into firm value and stock price and how good (and bad) decisions by 
the company’s leadership can have an amplified effect in the firm’s stock 
price. You need to know how good the leadership team of a firm is at creating 
a stream of good ideas and good decisions into the future. The goal of this 
lecture is to give you an idea of what affects the value of firms and how the 
decisions of management affect the values of the stocks (and bonds) the firm 
issues. 
Dividend Model
• 
In order to see how good managerial decisions can be amplified 
in the current stock price, we’re going to build a simple (but not 
simplistic) model that connects three items: the future opportunities 
and cash flows of the firm, the quality of managerial decision 
making, and the value of the firm’s securities. 
• 
This model is simply that the value of the firm is the present value 
of the cash flows that the firm generates using its human and 
physical capital. In general, these cash flows will be random. The 
way to value these cash flows is to determine their expected or 
average value and then discount them at a rate that is appropriate 
for their risk. 
• 
The model is a model of average or expected cash flows with a given 
amount of risk into the future. The standard approach is to value the 
firm as the present value of the stream of profits it generates into the 
future. The value of the firm is then the present value of the stream 
of cash flows that can be distributed to the claimants, where the 
discount rate used to calculate the present value is the firm’s cost of 
capital (or the required rate of return on the firm’s assets).

100
Lecture 13: Present Value of Growth Opportunities
• 
The approach is as follows: Determine the possible cash flows that 
can be distributed to claimants. These are called free cash flows. 
Then, determine the value of the firm by taking the present value of 
these free cash flows. Then, determine the value of debt. Subtract 
that from the firm value to get equity value. This is called the free 
cash flow approach. 
Stock Returns 
• 
Let’s examine stock returns more closely. Rather than value the 
whole firm and then subtract the value of the debt, you can also 
directly value the stock, based solely on the cash flows stockholders 
are expected to receive. 
• 
The basic approach is to recognize that holding the stock forever 
provides an infinite stream of dividends. Discounting the infinite 
stream of dividends at the rate of return investors require for the 
stock gives us the current value of the stock.
• 
Let’s assume that the stock today trades ex-dividend—that is, the 
next dividend is one period hence. In other words, if you buy the 
stock today, you have to wait a period to get the next dividend. 
Let’s say that the stock pays DIV1 1 year from now, DIV2 2 years 
from now, etc. Also let the required rate of return be r. Then, the 
price of the stock is simply

• 
If the discount rate is just 1 percentage point higher or lower, 
the value of the stock will vary by a wide amount. Therefore, it 
is extremely important to get the right discount rate given the  
firm’s risk. 
Managerial Decisions 
• 
Let’s turn to seeing how good decisions taken by the firm’s 
management translate into the current stock price. The price of 
stock depends crucially on the ability of the firm’s management to 
continually find positive net present value projects to invest in.

101
• 
To keep things simple, let’s consider an all-equity firm. Thus, all the 
cash flows of the firm are owned by the shareholders. Let’s say that 
this firm has $50 in capital per share. You can think of the $50 per 
share as being the value of the transformed “stuff” the management 
has created. Think of it as stuff that generates a cash flow every 
year. Because it is an all-equity firm, the equity holders get all of 
these cash flows (in one way or another).
• 
Let’s say that this capital generates 12% in earnings on average 
every year. So that we can use perpetuity formulas, let’s assume 
that it generates this 12% in profits at the end of the year. Once the 
firm gets the profits, it can pay it out to the shareholders. Thus, the 
$50 per share of capital throws off $6 per share every year. 
• 
Also, just to keep things simple, let’s assume that the $50 worth of 
capital the firm has per share does not depreciate—that is, it doesn’t 
wear out over time. This assumption is not essential, but it makes 
things easier to keep track of. 
• 
Given the riskiness of this firm’s business, let’s say that the investors 
require 10% return on the equity. Because it is an all-equity firm, 
the cost of capital for this firm is also 10%. 
Payout Policy 
• 
Next, consider the decisions that management can make with the 
cash flow. If the management pays all of this $6 out as a dividend, 
then it will not retain any earnings to “plow back” into the firm. In 
that case, the firm will not grow. The $50 in capital per share will 
just stay at $50. 
• 
If the firm pays out all of its earnings as a dividend, then what is the 
value of the stock? If the firm will always be able to generate 12% 
return on capital on average, then it can pay a $6 dividend every 
year (at the end of the year) on average. In that case, the stock is a 
perpetuity. Using the PV of a perpetuity formula and the required 
rate of return of 10%, the per-share value of the firm is simply P0 = 
$6/0.10 = $60. 

102
Lecture 13: Present Value of Growth Opportunities
• 
If this is the current policy of the management, then this is what you 
should be willing to pay for the stock. If you pay this amount, then 
you will get a 10% return on average, year after year.

• 
Can the firm increase its stock price by retaining some earnings to 
reinvest in itself? For example, what will happen if it plows back 
40% (and pays out 60%)? Let’s say that after 1 year (at t = 1), the 
firm will have $6. It pays out 0.6 × $6 = $3.60 and plows back 0.4 × 
$6 = $2.40. Thus, the dividend per share at t = 1 is $3.60. Under this 
policy, what will the firm pay as a dividend at t = 2? 
• 
At t = 2, the firm’s capital grew to $52.40 per share (the original $50 
plus the $2.40 in retained earnings). If the firm invests the $2.40 in 
retained earnings in the same capital as its original $50 in capital 
(capital that generates 10% earnings), then between t =1 and t = 2, 
the firm will generate 0.12 × $52.40 = $6.288 in earnings. 
• 
And out of that, it pays out 0.6 × $6.288 = $3.77 as a dividend at  
t = 2 and plows back 0.4 × $6.288 = $2.515. Thus, at t = 2, the 
capital is now $50 + $2.40 + $2.515 = $54.915. 
• 
Between t = 2 and t = 3, the firm generates 0.12 × 54.915 = $6.59, 
of which it pays out 0.6 × $6.59 = $3.954 as the dividend at t = 3 
and retains 0.4 × $6.59 = $2.636—and so on.
• 
Thus, the growth between t = 1 and t = 2 is (3.77 − 3.60)/3.60 = 0.048 
(4.8%). And the growth between t = 2 and t = 3 is (3.954 − 3.77)/ 
3.77 = 0.048 (i.e., also 4.8%). 
• 
If you continue on this way, and the capital continues to generate 
12% per year, then the growth in the dividend with the 40% payout 
ratio will be 4.8% in perpetuity. In fact, the growth rate in the 
dividend is simply plowback rate times the return on capital. That 
is, 4.8% is 40% of the required rate of return 12%. 

103
• 
If you took over the management of the company, would you want 
to plow back 40%? Right now, the firm pays a dividend of $6 per 
year, and the stock is worth $60. If you take over and plow back 
40%, will the shareholders view you as a hero or a goat? 
• 
There are two effects. First, the dividend is lower if the firm retains 
more. It was $6. Under your new 40% plowback policy, the next 
dividend will only be $3.60. That doesn’t sound good given that the 
value of the firm is the 
discounted stream of 
dividends. The second 
effect, however, is that 
under your potential 
plowback policy, the 
dividends will grow. 
• 
The efficacy of your 
policy 
depends 
on 
what happens to the 
stock 
price. 
Now, 
the share price is 
the PV of a growing perpetuity, with a 4.8% growth rate from the  
next dividend at t = 1 of $3.60. Thus, the price is now P0 = 
$3.6/(0.10 − 0.048) = $69.23. The price goes up; you are a hero. 
• 
Merely by changing the policy (not by spending any new money, 
just money that you already had), you make all of the shareholders 
obtain an instant 15% return (i.e., ($69.23 − $60)/$60 = 0.15). 
The Price-to-Earnings Ratio 
• 
The price-to-earnings ratio is typically used by value investors to 
determine whether a firm’s value is too high or too low. Seemingly, 
a stock with a price 15 to 20 times higher than its earnings is thought 
to be expensive relative to a stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of 
8 to 10. There is a way in which this makes sense: For simplicity, 
let the earnings be a measure of the amount of money that can be 
distributed—the potential cash flow of dividends of the firm. 

104
Lecture 13: Present Value of Growth Opportunities
• 
If the earnings don’t grow, then the price is simply P = E/r, where 
E is the earnings and r is the appropriate discount rate. If the price 
of the stock is the present value of the perpetual stream of average 
earnings, then the price-to-earnings ratio is simply P/E = 1/r. 
• 
This ratio might be too high based on mispricing. It might be that 
the real value should be E/r, but its market price is higher than that. 
This might have happened because the market’s expected earnings 
are too high or the discount rate is too low. Either way, the security 
is overvalued. 
• 
But it also might be that the price is high due to the present value 
of growth opportunities (PVGO), which is the difference between 
the value of stock if it doesn’t grow and the value of stock if it  
does grow. 
• 
If the firm has a lot of growth opportunities and a management 
team that can identify and implement new positive NPV projects, 
then the value of the firm equity will be P = E/r + PVGO, where 
(E/r) is the no-growth value of the firm. So, maybe the price of the 
firm’s equity is higher not because it is overvalued; maybe it has 
significant growth opportunities.

Lecture 14: Modeling Investor Behavior
Modeling Investor Behavior
Lecture 14
I
n this lecture, you will learn how economists model investor behavior. 
As is true with any model, the implications of the model may miss 
something important. For example, a model may tell you that something 
is not a risk when it is. In that case, investors will discount the prices of 
securities that have that “something.” Then, according to the model, it will 
look like a good deal when it really isn’t. In order for you to have intuition 
for when that occurs, you need to know how the model was built—not just 
its implications. All models start from the material presented in this lecture. 
Modeling Individual Behavior 
• 
The tradition in economics and finance is to index individuals as i 
and j (as in the ith person does A and the jth person responds by doing 
Z). To make this a bit less impersonal, we will use Ichabod (for i) 
and Jane (for j). 
• 
The atoms of economic analysis—i.e., the most primitive building 
block—are consumption bundles, preferences, opportunity sets, 
and choice. A consumption bundle is any combination of goods 
and services. For example, the following are three different 
consumption bundles.
○
○
Consumption bundle A = (12 cans of beer, 4 bags of potato 
chips, and 1 umbrella)
 
○
○
Consumption bundle B = (1 bottle of chardonnay, 12 oysters, 
and 1 umbrella)
 
○
○
Consumption bundle C = (1 bottle of chardonnay, 4 bags of 
potato chips, and 1 plastic poncho) 

107
• 
Let any specific consumption bundle consist of a list of the amounts 
for every single good and service in the universe. The items on the 
list may also be state dependent, such as “an umbrella on a rainy 
day in 2015.” 
• 
If there are K different goods and services, then a generic 
consumption bundle (for example, the mth out of many) is a vector 
Xm = (x1, x2, x3, … , xK), where x1 is the number of units of good/
service 1, x2 is the number of units of good/service 2, etc., all the 
way up to the last—the Kth—good. Note that x denotes a particular 
number of an individual good whereas X denotes a particular 
combination of all the goods.
• 
Next, we can characterize an individual’s opportunity set as the 
subset within the set of all possible consumption bundles that that 
individual can afford. Sometimes the opportunity set is defined by 
a budget constraint. That is, out of all the possible combinations 
of things, a person can only get the combinations that satisfy that 
person’s budget constraint. 
Preferences
• 
Once we have the opportunity set, we need an individual’s 
preferences over those opportunities. Preferences are modeled as 
follows: A set of preferences is a set of orderings for any two pairs 
of consumption bundles. For example, if the three consumption 
bundles previously described are the only possible bundles, then 
Ichabod’s preferences are fully characterized by A > B, A > C, B > 
C. Jane may have different preferences; she may have the following 
ranking: A < B, A < C, B > C. 
• 
Rather than have preference rankings for every pair, economists use 
a utility function that takes as its arguments the number of units of 
each good and spits out a number that is an index of the happiness 
the person achieves with that bundle. 

108
Lecture 14: Modeling Investor Behavior
• 
For the purposes of this lecture, the numbers don’t have to have 
any intrinsic meaning. All the utility numbers have to do is rank 
alternatives. That is, for any given pair of consumption bundles, the 
utility numbers must be such that the bundle that is preferred results 
in a higher number than the less-preferred bundle. 
• 
A utility function u j(X) that represents Jane’s preferences must be 
such that u j(X1) > u j(X2) if and only if Jane prefers X1 to X2, for all 
possible pairs of consumption bundles. 
• 
At this point, there are a bunch of questions economists like to ask, 
including the following: For any given set of preferences, does 
there exist at least 
one utility function 
that will represent 
those 
preferences? 
If there exists such 
a 
function, 
does 
that function have 
any nice properties? 
Is 
it 
continuous? 
Does it always have  
a derivative?
• 
The answer is that not all preferences have representations that 
are well-behaved functions. Rather, there are some conditions 
that, if imposed on preferences, will result in well-behaved  
utility functions. 
• 
One of the reasons economists want to impose these conditions is 
not because they think they reflect people’s preferences. In fact, 
in some cases, the conditions needed to generate well-behaved 
functions are violated by perfectly sensible preferences. The 
reason we impose these conditions is because we want to use the 
mathematical tools of constrained optimization—and we can only 
do that if we have well-behaved functions. 

109
• 
With well-behaved utility functions, we can use the mathematics of 
constrained optimization to maximize that person’s utility function 
subject to the budget constraint. The answer to this constrained 
optimization hopefully is predictive of how people pick among 
alternative opportunities. However, if the function does not really 
reflect a person’s preference, then the solution might be kind of dicey. 
Indirect Utility
• 
A person’s utility must go up if he or she has more income or 
wealth. As income or wealth increases, the budget constraint lets 
in more consumption bundles. With more consumption bundles to 
pick from, the person must be able to do at least as well as before—
probably better. 
• 
An indirect utility function is the answer to the following question: 
For a given person’s utility function of consumption bundles, what 
is the maximal utility that person can achieve with a given level  
of wealth?
• 
For example, let’s say that you have a monthly budget of $10,000. 
There are a bunch of things you could buy in a month with this 
money, including stocks, bonds, vacations, health care, chardonnay, 
and potato chips. The stocks and bonds allow you to buy maybe 
better vacations in the future. 
• 
Let’s say that when you pick the consumption bundle you like 
best, you achieve a level of happiness of 12,000 happiness units. 
If so, then your indirect utility function is u($10,000) = 12,000  
happiness units. 
• 
If you were to have a monthly budget of $15,000 instead, how 
much happier would you be? Given all the things you can afford 
with $15,000 per month, pick the consumption bundle you like best. 
Let’s say that that bundle generates 13,476 units of happiness. Your 
indirect utility function is then u($10,000) = 12,000 and u($15,000) 
= 13,476. 

110
Lecture 14: Modeling Investor Behavior
• 
Once we have an indirect utility of wealth function (i.e., we know 
u($10,000) = 12,000 and u($15,000) = 13,476), we can then start to 
ask how you would feel in happiness units if the amount of wealth 
you might have is random. Economists refer to this as preferences 
over lotteries. A lottery is defined as anything that makes our future 
wealth random.
Expected Utility 
• 
The most popular way for economists to model your preferences 
over lotteries is according to Von Neumann and Morgenstern’s 
expected utility hypothesis, which states that a person’s preferences 
over lotteries can be captured by the expected value of a carefully 
chosen indirect utility function. 
• 
Consider three consumption bundles: X1, X2, and X3. Let’s say that if 
you had $10,000, you would buy X1 out of all the choices you have 
available to you with $10,000. And if you had $15,000, you would 
buy X2. And if you had $17,000, you would buy X3. 
• 
In terms of indirect utility functions, it must be the case that 
u($17,000) > u($15,000) > u($10,000). Note that there may be 
many such functions that capture your preferences for money. The 
following will work: u($10,000) = 3, u($15,000) = 12, u($17,000) 
= 13. This works because the functions maintain order; you like 
more income to less income. But this different function works just 
as well: g($10,000) = 10, g($15,000) = 15, g($17,000) = 17.
• 
Now, let’s say that you are facing the following two lotteries.
○
○
Lottery 1: 50-50 chance at either $10,000 or $15,000
 
○
○
Lottery 2: 60% chance at $10,000 and 40% chance at $17,000.
• 
Let’s say that you prefer lottery 2 to lottery 1. According to the 
expected utility hypothesis, there exists an indirect utility function 
(maybe u, or maybe g, or maybe something else entirely) that 
will capture your preferences if we take the expected value of the 
utilities that are possible. 

111
• 
If the u function captures your preferences over lotteries, then the 
expected utility under lottery 1 should be smaller than the expected 
utility under lottery 2. The expected utility under lottery 1 is 
0.5 × 3 + 0.5 × 12 = 7.5. The expected utility under lottery 2 is  
0.6 × 3 + 0.4 × 13 = 7. That is, the u function says that lottery 
1 is better than lottery 2. So that function does not represent your 
preferences over lotteries.
• 
What about the g function? The expected utility of lottery 1 is 0.5 × 
10 + 0.5 × 15 = 12.5, and the expected utility of lottery 2 is 0.6 × 10 +  
0.4 × 17 = 12.8 > 12.5. This indirect utility function does capture 
your preferences over, at least, these two lotteries. 
• 
It may not work for other lotteries. And there are clearly other 
functions that will also work for the choice over these two lotteries. 
• 
So, what we need—for each person—is to find a function for that 
person that captures his or her preferences over all possible lotteries. 
Once we have that, we can start to predict people’s answers to the 
following questions: How much would I be willing to pay to get rid 
of a risk I face now? How much would I have to get paid to bear a 
risk I don’t have now?
• 
The shape of the indirect utility function tells us something about 
people’s aversion to variation in outcomes. How do we get indirect 
utility functions for people in the market? The answer is that we 
don’t. Rather, we typically just assume some function that has some 
features we like, such as that it’s easy to work with. 
• 
And this is where financial economists may be on thin ice. Many of 
the functions used in finance are such that only the expected value 
and the variance matter. But there is much evidence to suggest 
that people care about much more than just the expected value  
and variance. 

112
Lecture 14: Modeling Investor Behavior
• 
If we use utility functions that imply that only mean and variance 
matter, then we will have missed some important features of 
investors’ preference. If we use such functions to build an asset 
pricing model, then the model may imply that something is not 
important when in fact it is. That means that when we use a model 
to tell us what risk is and what return we should get for that risk, it 
may be misleading.

1.	 Using the choices offered in question 1 for Lecture 1, can you use the 
expected utility hypothesis to infer the shape of your indirect utility 
function of wealth? 
2.	 Some people cannot judge how they might feel in the event that they 
have extreme amounts of wealth or income. Do you think more people 
overestimate or underestimate how happy they might be if they won 
the lottery? Given your view, do you think that the expected utility 
hypothesis would be useful at capturing people’s attitudes toward risk  
and uncertainty?

Managing Risk in Portfolios
Lecture 15
I
n this lecture, you will learn about the value of diversification. In 
addition, you will learn how different combinations of individual 
securities create different portfolio return characteristics (in terms of risk 
and return) and the extent to which risk can be reduced without also reducing 
average return. You will also learn the benefits in terms of risk and return 
associated with diversity in the characteristics of the available securities and 
the types of information on individual securities needed in order to build an  
optimal portfolio.

 For the purposes of this lecture, we are going 
to simply think of these returns as just random variables. It is 
important to always keep in mind that for any given period, the 
actual return on an individual security may be very different from 
its expected value. 
• 
For a random variable, such as the return on a specific security, 
we might refer to the expected value and the realized value. The 
realized value is the value that actually occurs given a single draw 
from the distribution; the expected value is the probability-weighted 
sum of all of the possible values that might be realized. 
• 
Portfolio theory considers how the return characteristics of 
individual securities affect the characteristics of the return on a 
portfolio of individual securities. In portfolio theory, a portfolio is 
defined as a set of weights w = (w1, w2, w3, … , wn, … , wN), where 
N is the total number of securities being considered, n is a generic 
index for a security (ranging from 1 to N), and wn is the weight 
placed on the nth security. 

114
Lecture 15: Managing Risk in Portfolios
• 
In general, the expected return on a portfolio is the weighted 
average of expected returns on the individual securities, where 
the weights used in the average are the portfolio weights for each 
individual security: E(Rport) = (w1(E(R1))) + ((1 − w1)(E(R2))). With 
this expression, we can systematically vary the weights between 
the two securities and see how the expected return and standard 
deviation vary. 
Variance (or Standard Deviation) Effects 
• 
The variance of a portfolio return is more complicated than that of 
an individual security because we need to know how the return on 
one security is related to the return on the other. 
• 
For example, consider the case in which when one security has a big 
positive return, then the other security typically has a big negative 
return, and when the first has a big negative return, the other has a 
big positive return. Let’s say that these securities infrequently have 
small or medium negative or positive returns. Thus, both of these 
securities have high variances alone. 
In order to build an optimal portfolio, you must understand the value  
of diversification.

115
• 
Consider a portfolio with a 50-50 split between the two securities. 
In this case, the expected return on the portfolio return will clearly 
be close to zero. What about the variance in this case? When the 
first security has a positive return, then the typically negative return 
of the other pulls the portfolio return down to zero. Similarly, when 
the first security has a negative return, then the typically positive 
return on the other pulls the portfolio return up to zero. 
• 
In this case, the variance of the portfolio return is low because 
regardless of what happens to either individual security, the 
portfolio return is close to its mean return of zero. This implies that 
the portfolio return has a small variance. Thus, even though both 
of the individual securities have high variance on their own, the 
portfolio variance is small. 
• 
In contrast, consider the case in which when one security has a 
big positive return, so does the other usually, and when the first 
security has a big 
negative 
return, 
so 
does the other. Taken 
alone, they both have 
only large positive and 
negative returns and, 
as a result, have large 
individual variances. 
• 
In this case, the return 
on a 50-50 portfolio 
will either be big 
positive (when both 
are big positive) or big negative (when both are big negative). 
Because we don’t know a priori which will occur, the average 
return for the portfolio will be close to zero (the average of a big 
positive and a big negative). But the variance will be large because 
the realized returns on the portfolio will either be big positive  
or big negative. 

116
Lecture 15: Managing Risk in Portfolios
• 
Note that in both cases, the individual securities had large variance. 
However, in the first case, the variance of the portfolio return was 
small, whereas for the second case, the variance of the portfolio 
variance was large. This relationship can be captured using the 
concepts and formulas for correlation and covariance. Recall that 
the covariance of two random variables is the expected value of 
the product of one variable’s deviation from its mean and the other 
variable’s deviation from its mean. 
• 
If the most likely outcomes are associated with one being above its 
mean while the other is also above its mean, then the covariance 
is positive. If the most likely outcomes are associated with one 
being above its mean while the other is below its mean, then the 
covariance is negative. 
• 
The correlation ranges from 1 to −1, with the sign indicating 
whether the covariance is positive or negative and the magnitude 
of the correlation indicating the strength of the relationship. If 
the correlation is 1 or −1, then they are perfectly positively or 
negatively correlated, 
and 
knowing 
one 
tells 
you 
exactly 
what the other is. A 
correlation of zero 
says that there is no 
connection between 
the two. 
• 
Given the variances 
of two returns and the 
covariance between 
those two returns, 
there is an expression for the variance of a linear combination of 
random variables. We can use this expression for portfolios because 
the return on a portfolio is just a weighted average of the returns on 
the individual securities. 

117
• 
For a two-security case, the variance of the return on the portfolio 
consists of three main parts. The first is the weight on the first 
security squared multiplied by the variance of the return on that 
security. The second is a similar expression but for the second 
security; it is the weight on the second security squared multiplied 
by the variance of that security. The third component utilizes the 
correlation between the two securities: It is 2 times the weight on 
the first security times the weight on the second security, with all 
of that multiplied by the covariance. The covariance is equal to 
the correlation between 1 and 2, times the standard deviation of 1, 
times the standard deviation of 2. 
• 
Consider three special cases: when the correlation is positive, 
when there is no correlation, and when the correlation is negative. 
Of these three cases, positive correlation is the most likely for 
most securities. This is true because most securities move in the 
same direction: When 
there is good news 
in the market, that is 
typically good news for  
most securities, which 
will all likely have 
positive returns on that 
day. Similarly, most 
securities 
will 
have 
negative returns on a 
bad-news day. 
• 
In the case of perfect positive correlation, the standard deviation is 
SDrp = w1σ1 + w2σ2, where w1σ1 is the weight on security 1 times the 
standard deviation of return on security 1 and w2σ2 is the weight on 
security 2 times the standard deviation on security 2. 
• 
Perfect negative correlations are rare for securities that represent 
the claims on actual cash flows from firms, like stock and bonds. 
This is true because it requires that when one firm is doing well, the 
other firm is doing poorly. 

118
Lecture 15: Managing Risk in Portfolios
• 
In the case of perfect negative correlation, the standard deviation 
becomes SDrp = w1σ1 − w2σ2. That is, the standard deviation has the 
same two parts as with the perfect positive correlation case, but in 
this equation, w2σ2 is subtracted from w1σ1. 
• 
In the perfect negative correlation case, because the two parts 
are subtracted, this means that we can create some really good 
combinations of expected return and standard deviation by picking 
the weights to place on each security. 
• 
In fact, we can actually create a combination that has no standard 
deviation. To form such a portfolio, the weights are as follows.

 In this case, there will be a reduction in

Multiple Securities 
• 
So far, we have considered just combining two securities together 
into a portfolio. If you combine many securities together, then you 
can get even bigger variance benefits. In fact, for any given level of 
expected return, a portfolio of the complete set of securities can be 
formed to produce the lowest possible standard deviation. 
• 
To get the minimum variance portfolio for a particular mean 
return, simply search over all the different sets of weights  
(w1, w2, … , wk) until you find the weights that are associated with 
the lowest variance. 

119
• 
The set of combinations of expected return and lowest standard 
deviation is referred to as the minimum variance frontier. This 
frontier looks like a hyperbola. The portfolio that is associated 
with the lowest standard deviation is called the global minimum 
variance portfolio. This is the portfolio associated with the bottom 
of the “on-its-side U.” 
Efficient Frontier
• 
There are some points on the minimum variance frontier that are 
not particularly useful. For example, why would anyone want a 
portfolio on the lower part of the hyperbola? On the lower part of 
the hyperbola, the expected return is lower than that associated with 
the global minimum variance portfolio. 
• 
For any possible level of portfolio risk, you can get a higher expected 
return by picking the portfolio on the upper branch associated with 
that level of standard deviation rather than the portfolio on the 
lower branch associated with that standard deviation. 
• 
The efficient frontier is the minimum variance frontier with all of 
these useless portfolios thrown out. Note that you may be able to 
shift the frontier toward the y-axis (that is, toward less variance) by 
adding additional securities. 
• 
This is especially true if you add securities that are either 
uncorrelated or negatively correlated with the current set of 
securities. Such a shift typically occurs when you add the securities 
of foreign markets. This is good in that for any given expected 
return, you will have less “risk” in the return on the portfolio. 
Which Portfolio is Optimal? 
• 
The efficient frontier only contains risky securities. These are either 
stocks or bonds that mature at times different than your holding 
period. The portfolio you want will contain both risky and risk-free 
securities. You will want to hold a fraction of your wealth in the 
risk-free investments and only one of the portfolios on the frontier.

Lecture 15: Managing Risk in Portfolios
• 
In an expected return standard deviation plot, consider a portfolio 
on the frontier. Because the risk-free return is not random, then 
any combination of wealth invested in the risk-free and that 
portfolio will create the set of expected return–standard deviation 
combinations along the line from Rf at zero risk through the point 
representing the risky portfolio. 
• 
If you want to bear little risk, you invest less in the risky portfolio 
and more in the risk-free security. As you increase the amount of 
your wealth that you put at risk, you will slide up the line. The slope 
of this line is the Sharpe ratio for that risky portfolio. 
• 
In general, the Sharpe ratio for any portfolio is defined as

 Intuitively, this measure tells you how much 
extra expected return you get per unit of standard deviation for a 
given portfolio. 
• 
You want the portfolio on the efficient frontier that generates 
the highest Sharpe ratio. You then control the amount of risk by 
deciding how much of your wealth to put at risk. However, for each 
unit of risk, you will be getting more return above the risk-free rate 
than any other portfolio available on the frontier.

n this lecture, you will be introduced to a statistical model of returns 
that has some parameters that correspond to variables that have 
been discussed previously. You will then learn how to estimate these 
parameters using data on the past returns of securities—a technique known 
as regression analysis. With the estimates from regression analysis, you will 
be able to quantify the characteristics of a security. This will be useful for 
understanding the security’s risk and perhaps the mispricing it might have 
relative to an asset pricing model. You will learn how to use these estimates 
to quantify the variance-covariance matrix, which is useful for forming 
optimal risky portfolios.
Data-Generating Process
• 
Let’s develop a simple statistical model to describe security returns. 
With such a model, we will be able to build up to the variance-
covariance matrix. It will be useful to think of the information we 
have as coming from what we call a data-generating process (DGP), 
which is just a mathematical description of how the observed data 
is generated. 
Regression analysis is a model that uses mathematical and statistical 
techniques to describe returns.

123
• 
The simplest DGP is the following: The return on a specific security 
in excess of the risk-free rate can be divided in to two independent 
sources, as follows.
○
○
The first source is common across all securities and is related 
to general features or happenings in the economy as a whole. 
These “features” include things like the level of interest rates; 
the amount of GNP growth; and the level of input prices, such 
as the price of natural gas and petroleum products, and so on. 
 
○
○
The second source is specific to that particular firm; this source 
is “idiosyncratic” to that security rather than common across all 
securities. These things might include factors like the fact that 
the CEO is going through a divorce and is a bit more distracted 
than usual, or that the R & D team has made a technological 
advance that will make their products more reliable than  
the competition’s. 
• 
To keep the model simple, we aggregate all of the individual 
common factors down into one factor, which we will say is the 
market factor. Because it is difficult for us to have a good idea of 
how all of these individual common factors “aggregate” up, we will 
simply let the market tells us that and use some broad-based index 
of security prices as the market factor. For example, we could use 
the return on the S&P 500 to indicate all of the things that affect  
the market. 
• 
If you think you have all of the common factors appropriately 
aggregated in the market factor rM, then the idiosyncratic 
component of return is simply everything that is not “explained” by 
the common factor. We can summarize the DGP via the following 
mathematical expression.
o	 ri − rf = αi + (βi(rM − rf )) + εi
• 
In the expression, ri is the return in the ith security and rf is the 
risk-free rate, so ri − rf is the return on security i in excess of the 
risk-free rate. The common factor is the return on the market (rM) in 
excess of the risk-free rate (i.e., rM − rf ). 

124
Lecture 16: The Behavior of Stock Prices
• 
This is called a single-factor model because there is a single factor 
that explains the returns of securities. In this case, the single factor 
is the return on the market. This single-factor model is also called 
the market model. 
• 
Although every security is affected by the common factor rM − rf , 
the amount that it is affected by can vary by security according to 
βi, the coefficient on the common factor in the expression. Thus, 
the amount the ith security is affected by the common factor is  
βi(rM − rf). You can think of the beta as summarizing how the return 
reacts to market conditions, as summarized by the market return. 
• 
In the expression, there are two other parts. The αi is a constant 
component. It says that the excess return for security i has a 
constant component that doesn’t change when the market moves. 

125
The second other part is everything else: the idiosyncratic part—all 
the stuff that is not explained by the market movement. 
• 
With the single-factor model, we have two sources of variation in 
returns: the market and idiosyncratic returns. And we have three 
parameters that characterize the nature of the relationship between 
returns and these sources. The first parameter is the constant αi . The 
seconds is the βi . The third variable of interest is the variance of the 
idiosyncratic part. 
• 
We need to be able to estimate the values of αi , βi , and Var(εi ) for a 
bunch of securities. Numbers corresponding to the beta are readily 
available all over the Internet. But you need to be careful with these 
betas, because sometimes they don’t make sense, depending on 
which site you look at.
Regression 
• 
All of the parameters that characterize the security return can be 
estimated using a statistical technique called regression analysis, 
which is a process whereby you let data determine the best 
relationship for “fitting” the data. 
• 
Data on the risk-free rate is difficult to find. Also, the return on “the 
market” is difficult to find, depending on how you want to define 
“the market.” Kenneth French’s personal website has a data library 
section that provides this data at a variety of different intervals, 
such as annually. The data is periodically updated to include the 
most recent periods. 
• 
Regression analysis seeks to find the single straight line that fits 
the data the best. The word “best” refers to the notion that the 
average size of the errors about the line is the smallest. What is 
meant by “error”? In regression analysis, we divide the data into 
two categories: the dependent variable and explanatory variables. 
• 
The dependent variable is what we are trying to explain. It is the 
variable that depends on the variables whose variation explains 

126
Lecture 16: The Behavior of Stock Prices
the variation in the 
dependent 
variable. 
In the single-factor 
model, we are trying 
to explain the return 
on 
an 
individual 
security 
given 
the 
return on the market.
• 
The return on the 
individual security is 
the dependent variable; the return on the market is the explanatory 
variable. The “error” is the difference between what the explanatory 
variable “predicts” and what actually happened. 
• 
Regression analysis is all about finding the best line. The criterion 
used to pick the best line is the sum of squared errors. This is 
equivalent to looking at the mean squared error, which in this case 
is simply the average squared error for the observations. 
• 
Regression picks the single line that has the smallest sum of squared 
errors or the smallest mean squared error. That is, it picks the line 
that fits the data the best in the sense that the errors from the line are 
the smallest on average. 
• 
You have to be careful with regression analysis if there are outliers, 
which are observations that are really out of the ordinary. If you 
had to pick a line that fits best in terms of mean squared error, you 
would have to pick a line that goes through the outlier. Because this 
outlier is very far away from the others, if you put the regression 
line through it, it will have a gigantic error. 
• 
If you fit a line through that outlier, then the regression line will 
indicate a negative relationship between the return on the firm 
and the market. That is, the estimating regression will give you a 
negative beta. 

127
• 
The 
outlier 
should 
be 
downplayed, if not completely 
ignored. If the regression is re-
estimated without the outlier, 
the regression line will go 
through the normal cluster of 
data and will have an upward 
slope. This will be a much 
more accurate reflection of the 
actual relationship. 
Idiosyncratic Variance
• 
Once we have the best alpha and beta from regression analysis, 
we can also get the variance of the idiosyncratic terms. The errors 
are just the difference between the line and the actual data. If the 
regression line is the relationship between the return on the security 
and the market, then the regression errors are the idiosyncratic 
terms. Thus, the mean square error from the regression is the 
variance of the idiosyncratic part.
• 
If you estimate a linear regression single-factor model for a set of 
securities, you have enough information to write down the variance-
covariance matrix, which is simply a table of variances for each 
security and the covariances of each pair of securities. You could 
create such a table in a spreadsheet. You can also use the variance-
covariance matrix to form efficient or minimum variance portfolios.
• 
To get the variance-covariance matrix, we need to calculate  
the variances. Then, we need to calculate the covariance. First,  
let’s consider the variances. The return DGP for security i is  
ri − rf = αi + (βi(rM − rf )) + εi .
• 
Based on this expression, we can calculate the variance of the 
return on this security. There are only two sources of variation for 
ri. Alpha is a constant, so it doesn’t vary (by definition). Because 
beta is a parameter, it presumably doesn’t vary either. 

128
Lecture 16: The Behavior of Stock Prices
• 
However, because rM varies, the variance of the component due to 
common variation is (βi
2)(Var(rM)). That is, recall that the variance 
is the expected value of the squared deviations. Because we want to 
get the variance of the deviation caused by the common factor and 
the common factor is multiplied by beta, we get beta squared times 
the variance of the common factor. 
• 
The second source is from the idiosyncratic part. The idiosyncratic 
part is all the variation that cannot be explained by market 
movements. The variance of the idiosyncratic terms is then simply 
the average, or mean, of the squared errors. 
• 
Let’s simply denote this variance by σεi
2. Then, for any asset i, we 
have the variance of the excess return on i equals Var(ri − rf ) = 
(βi 
2(Var(rM − rf ))) + σεi
2. 
• 
Thus, from the regression output, you can decompose the  
variance into two components: the part that is due to systematic  
or common factors, which is βi 
2(Var(rM − rf )); and the part that  
is due to idiosyncratic factors, which is σεi
2.
• 
If you are going to take an active position in a security that has 
a significant portion of its variance from the idiosyncratic 
component, then you should realize that if you take a large position 
in that security, you will be bearing idiosyncratic risk that would 
normally be diversified away if you simply held that security in a  
market-like portfolio. 
• 
Next, let’s get the covariances. To see how, line up the return 
expressions for any two securities. 
o	 r1 − rf = α1 + (β1(rM − rf )) + e1
 
o	 r2 − rf = α2 + (β2(rM − rf )) + e2
• 
If you do this, you can see that they have only one element in 
common: the excess return on the market (rM − rf ). The constants 
α1 and α2 don’t vary (by definition). Also, e1 and e2 don’t covary 

129
because they are due to things that are unique to each firm or 
security. When e1 is negative (e.g., the CEO was discovered 
committing fraud), that tells you nothing important about any other 
unique thing that might be happening at the second firm. 
• 
Thus, the only source of covariance is rM − rf  . Because one moves 
at a rate β1 and the other at a rate β2 given movements in the market, 
the covariance is simply (β1)(β2)(Var(rM )). So, once you have a 
set of regression outputs, one for each security, you can form the 
variance-covariance matrix for a collection of securities using the 
output of the regressions.

Lecture 17: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Lecture 17
I
n this lecture, you will explore what an equilibrium asset pricing model 
is in general. As part of this exploration, you will learn what equilibrium 
is and why an equilibrium model is useful. In addition, you will learn 
about the most popular and well-known asset pricing model: the capital 
asset pricing model (CAPM). In the process, you will see why and how 
the implications of such a model depend on assumptions. Finally, you will 
address the intuition that CAPM generates. The outcome of this process is 
obtaining a way to measure risk in the context of a portfolio. 
Equilibrium
• 
There are two types of analyses that economists (and financial 
economists) conduct: normative and positive. Normative analysis 
tells you how you should behave—that is, it gives you advice for 
optimally solving a problem that you as an individual face. 
• 
The second type of analysis is positive. With this type of analysis, 
economists posit individual behavior and the mechanisms by which 
individuals interact. Then, they derive the implications of those 
behaviors and mechanisms. In economics and finance, most of the 
implications are on market prices. 
• 
Scientists, including financial economists, are interested in 
understanding how the world works. Because there is no manual 
that describes how the world works, we instead posit certain 
relationships that generate implications so that we can test those 
implications. This is the scientific method. Financial economists are 
constantly making assumptions, deriving their implications, testing 
these implications, and eliminating those that are inconsistent with 
the data. 

131
• 
While many people may only be interested in understanding how 
the world works for its own sake, another reason that we model 
investor behavior is to derive equilibrium implications, which 
might actually help us with normative analysis. 
• 
A system is in equilibrium when it is at rest. The system is at rest 
when there are no internal tensions or forces that are creating 
change. Knowing about equilibrium allows us to make some 
predictions when we are out of equilibrium. But, more importantly, 
if we know where a stock price is going eventually, we can 
predict its average movement over time based on knowing the  
equilibrium value.
• 
In finance, we model investors’ behavior so that we can make them 
interact with each other mathematically in order to predict where 
the equilibrium price will be once everyone is done making trades. 
This tells us where prices will end up. This then tells us the direction 
prices will move on average. 
• 
Of course, one potential drawback of this approach is that the whole 
premise is wrong. The premise is that something happens, then 
things react, until they stop happening. Instead, what is more likely 
is that something happens, things react, and then something new 
happens. That is, we never have “until they stop happening.” 
• 
Most economists would say that equilibrium analysis is still useful, 
however, because it predicts what happens between stimuli: There 
is some structure to the reaction. Furthermore, perhaps we can get 
better predictions if we can build even bigger models to figure out 
the equilibrium behavior of the stimuli. Rather than give up on the 
notion of equilibrium, we just need more complex models with 
more complex equilibria. 

132
Lecture 17: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
CAPM
• 
The first normative result we get from the capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM) is a measure of risk for an individual security. 
Remember, the return variance of an individual security cannot  
be risk. 
• 
The second normative result is a measure of the amount of extra 
return an investor should get for bearing the risk of an individual 
security. This is normative in the sense that it tells you the rate to 
use to discount future cash flows given the riskiness of those cash 
flows. It also tells you when a security is mispriced—which then 
suggests a trade opportunity.
• 
As is true with all equilibrium asset pricing models, CAPM is a 
model of the cross-section of returns—that is, CAPM tells us what 
explains or generates variation in average returns across the large 
set of securities available in the market. Whether you take the 
normative advice of CAPM depends on whether you believe that 
CAPM describes the world you live in. 
• 
Equilibrium models all have the same elements. They all have 
individual demands as a function of prices. Then, they impose the 
condition that supply equals demand. When supply equals demand, 
we are in equilibrium. When supply equals demand, there is no 
need for prices to change. 
• 
So, we need investor demands first. What are the demands used 
by CAPM? People have information on how the returns of all the 
securities are jointly distributed, and based on that information, 
they pick an optimal risky portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe 
ratio, which is the expected return on a portfolio minus the  
risk-free rate—the expected excess return—all divided by the 
standard deviation of the return on that portfolio. The Sharpe ratio 
is a measure of the extra return you get in excess of the risk-free 
rate per unit of standard deviation. 

133
• 
By assuming that investors pick portfolios to maximize the  
Sharpe ratio, we assume that all investors have mean/variance 
utility functions—that they don’t care about other things like 
skewness. 
However, 
it 
is clear that the model 
will 
capture 
something 
important because it is clear 
that investors do care about 
the mean and the variance 
of their returns. 
• 
The standard deviation of 
the return on an individual 
security is not a good 
measure of risk. However, 
from now on, the standard 
deviation of the best risky 
portfolio will be called 
“risk.” If it is the best risky 
portfolio, then you want to 
hold it—and only it. If it is 
the only risky portfolio you 
hold, then all the variance 
you face in terms of your 
wealth comes from the 
returns on this portfolio. 
In that case, the standard 
deviation of the return on this portfolio is risk. So, standard 
deviations for individual securities are not risk; the standard 
deviation for the best risky portfolio is risk. 
• 
What is the best risky portfolio? You want a portfolio with a high 
Sharpe ratio because, if you’re going to take on some risk, you want 
to get paid as much as possible per unit of risk you take on. Also 
recall that you can control the total amount of risk by deciding how 
much money to invest in that risky portfolio and how much money 
to invest in risk-free securities (like savings accounts). 

134
Lecture 17: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
• 
This last step is key. It says that everyone wants a high Sharpe 
ratio. Some investors don’t mind risk, while others do. Both types 
of people can control the total amount of risk in their overall 
portfolio—which includes the risky and riskless investments—by 
deciding how much to put in the best risky portfolio. They should 
not control risk by picking a different risky portfolio. 
Market Clearing
• 
Everyone wants the same portfolio of risky securities. That portfolio 
must be one where supply equals demand. As such, that optimal 
risky portfolio that everyone wants must be the market portfolio. 
If not, then we don’t have market clearing—we don’t have supply 
equals demand. 
• 
So, the prices of securities adjust until everyone wants the market 
portfolio. If the market portfolio is the optimal portfolio, then we 
can ask, what is the risk of an individual security in the context 
of the best portfolio you can hold? We will measure risk as the 
volatility or variance of the return on our risky investment portfolio. 
The risky investment portfolio is what generates variation in our 
wealth, which is risk.
• 
If our overall portfolio consists of risk-free assets and the optimal 
risky portfolio, then it is fairly clear that our only source of risk is 
the variance of the return on the risky portfolio. So, let’s measure the 
risk of an individual security as the amount that security contributes 
to the variance of the return on the optimal risky portfolio. 
• 
To do that, we just take a mathematical derivative, which is an 
analytical expression for the rate of change in something given a 
change in something else. In the case of the security, we ask, what 
is the rate of change in the market portfolio variance given that we 
change the weight on the ith security a little bit? That derivative 
is equal to something called the market beta, which is defined as 
(
)
,
.
(
)
i
M
i
M
Cov R R
Var R
β =

135
• 
This is equivalent to the slope of a regression line of the excess 
return on security i on the excess market return. The beta of a 
security with respect to the market portfolio is the measure of risk 
for that security. 
• 
We could ask how much a particular security contributes to the 
variance of any portfolio—for example, the one you currently hold 
(which may not be the market portfolio). Given what you hold, 
we could calculate the covariance of the return on security i with 
the return on your risky portfolio, divided by the variance of the 
return on your portfolio. That would be the amount of risk security i 
contributes to your portfolio. If we all held different portfolios, then 
we would all need to have different measures of risk. 
• 
This is why CAPM is so popular. It says that there is only one 
measure of risk for a security that works for everyone. That measure 
is the beta of that security with the market only—because we are all 
supposed to be holding just that portfolio. This makes it easy. We 
can tell everyone the same thing. 
• 
Market beta is risk. But, if you are not holding the market, the 
market beta may not be risk for you. However, unless you have 
a good reason not to, you should be holding the market as your  
risky portfolio. 
The CAPM Pricing Equation
• 
For any individual risky security, we have the following.
o	 E(Ri) − γßi = Rf =
 
o	 E(Ri) = Rf + ßi (E(RM) − Rf )
• 
This is the CAPM pricing equation. Intuitively, it says that the 
return on the ith security should be equal to the risk-free rate plus 
an amount extra to compensate you for holding the risk of that 
security, where the risk is measured by its market beta and the price 
per unit of risk is E(RM) − Rf  . 

136
Lecture 17: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
• 
If you have a security that has more units of risk—that is, its beta is 
high—then it should get a higher expected return. The more units of 
risk, the higher the expected return. 
• 
CAPM is a single-factor model. It says that there is only one source 
of risk—the risk that the market will go up and down. Thus, whether 
a security is risky or not depends on how correlated it is with the 
market. A security that goes down when the market is down is risky. 
Just when you need a good payoff—when the market is down—so 
is the return on that security. Risk is correlation. 
• 
CAPM is also a little judgmental. It says that you only get 
compensated for the risk of a security in the context of the market 
portfolio, even if you don’t hold the market portfolio. Because 
everyone else only holds the market, then you should only get 
compensated for the amount of risk that security produces in that 
portfolio. If you want to hold some nonoptimal portfolio, go ahead. 
But the market will not compensate you for the extra variation a 
security produces in a suboptimal portfolio because no one forced 
you to do that. 
• 
CAPM also tells us that idiosyncratic volatility—the variation not 
explained by systematic or market movements—does not matter. 
Such idiosyncratic variation is due to economic factors that are not 
common, or shared, across securities. If you hold a well-diversified 
portfolio, then all of the idiosyncratic volatility will get diversified 
away, and what is left is only variation created by common, or 
market, movements. 
• 
Another way to interpret CAPM is that the market only pays you 
for risk that cannot be avoided. The movements that cannot be 
avoided are the movements caused by general market conditions 
that are common to all. Because you can eliminate idiosyncratic 
volatility, you should not be compensated for bearing it.

1.	 The CAPM is based on assumptions about investors that imply that the 
“market portfolio” is the sole optimal risky portfolio that all investors

tolerances for risk? If so, why? Do you think that the interior decorator

Lecture 18: How to Exploit Mispriced Securities
How to Exploit Mispriced Securities
Lecture 18
I
n this lecture, you will learn how the equilibrium models developed in 
previous lectures can be used to determine if something is too expensive 
or cheap enough. First, you need to examine short selling in detail. The 
second step is to develop a framework in which you can take the implications 
of an asset pricing model and apply them to securities in the market to 
identify mispricing. The third step entails using information about a stock’s 
alpha and its idiosyncratic volatility to form an optimal risky portfolio that 
exploits mispricing without taking on too much risk. 
Step 1: Short Sales 
• 
The overarching idea of this lecture is “everything is a good 
idea if it’s cheap enough, and everything is a bad idea if it’s too 
expensive.” As it turns out, this statement is not completely accurate 
for investments because you also can make a gain if the price is too 
high. In order to do so, however, you have to be able to take a short 
position in a security. 
• 
A short position is when you sell a security that you don’t own. To 
do that, you have to borrow it; then, you sell it. At some point in the 
future, you have to return it, which you do by buying back at the 
market price then. 
• 
Another famous saying is “buy low; sell high.” A short position lets 
you make money by reversing the order: “sell high; buy low.” So, 
even if something is too expensive, it may still be a “good idea”—if 
the idea is to short it. Of course, shorting might turn out badly. 
• 
The way to think about a short sale is that it is—on average—
borrowing money at the expected rate of return on the security you 
borrowed. So, you can use a short sale to either speculate on a drop 
in price or to borrow money.

139
• 
But when you sell short via an online broker, you need to have a 
margin account. In that case, you may be borrowing just to be able 
to borrow (by shorting). You might end up paying interest twice: If 
the stock price rises, then you will be paying interest with the run 
up in the stock price, and the broker will charge you interest on any 
money you might have to borrow to keep the margin current. 
• 
In addition to these costs, you should also realize that there might 
be a limit to the amount you can short due to a lack of availability 
of shares to borrow. Also, sometimes after you have shorted, you 
may have to close out your short position before you want—before 
the price falls. Typically, when you short, you borrow shares from 
some other account at your broker’s. 
• 
In fact, when you open an account, you typically will agree to allow 
the shares you have to be lent to other customers of the broker. You 
will not care if they are lent out because if the stock pays a dividend 
while it is lent out, the short seller must pay you the dividend. And 
if you want to sell shares that have been lent, the broker will give 
your shares back and lend out shares from another account to the 
shorter. Thus, you really don’t give anything up by lending shares.
• 
There are times when nobody is willing to lend shares anymore 
(because perhaps they want to sell). In that case, you will not be 
able to maintain your short position. Once your broker cannot find 
shares to borrow, you will have to close out your short position—
and that might be at a loss. The other problem with a short position 
is that you can lose more than your initial position. 
Step 2: Mispricing Relative to an Asset Pricing Model
• 
In general, an asset pricing model will tell you how to trade based 
on a deviation from the implications of that asset pricing model. 
We will stick with CAPM because it is a single-factor model, 
which simplifies things a bit and allows you to imagine the process  
more easily. 

140
Lecture 18: How to Exploit Mispriced Securities
• 
Recall that CAPM says that the expected return for a particular 
security should exceed the risk-free rate exactly by the product of 
that security’s beta with the market risk premium. Furthermore, 
CAPM says that 
this should hold for 
all securities. 
• 
If 
you 
form 
a 
scatter 
plot 
of  
the average return 
on 
the 
vertical 
axis against beta 
on the horizontal 
axis, according to 
CAPM, 
the 
data 
should 
have 
an 
intercept 
on 
the 
vertical 
axis 
at 
the risk-free rate; 
that is, a security 
with a beta of zero 
on the horizontal 
axis 
should, 
on 
average, return the  
risk-free rate. 
• 
Then, 
for 
beta 
larger than zero, 
the average return 
should increase at a constant rate. The constant rate should be the 
market risk premium (i.e., the expected return on the market minus 
the risk-free rate). 
• 
Thus, according to CAPM, all of the data should land on a straight 
line. This line is called the security market line (SML). If there 
is any security that does not lie on the SML, then that security  
is mispriced. 

141
• 
The CAPM model is consistent with the single-factor model, 
where the single factor is the market return. That is, the market 
return is a sufficient statistic for all of the risk in the economy. The  
single-factor model is

 You want to 
take advantage of the nonzero alpha by forming a portfolio with a 
neutral beta. 
• 
The hardest part of investing is finding securities with nonzero 
alphas. There are two approaches to finding nonzero alphas. The 
first is the result of the following process.
1. 
Forecast cash flows. Either take analyst forecasts or make your 
own based on your knowledge of the firm and industry. 
 
2. 
Determine the riskiness of the cash flows. How sensitive are 
these cash flows to the market? 
 
3. 
Calculate the discounted value of the free cash flows to 
determine the firm’s value. Subtract an estimate of the value of 
debt to get the value of the equity. Think of this as the future 
value that will occur once the market reaches equilibrium. 
 
4. 
Compare the value in step 3 with the current market price. If 
different, then guess at a horizon as to when your value from 
step 3 will be reflected in the market. 
• 
The second approach is to run a regression of the return on the 
equity minus the risk-free rate on the returns of the market minus 
the risk-free rate. The constant in this regression is alpha. Use 
this alpha as your estimate of the return in excess of what CAPM 
implies it should be. 
• 
Both methods have problems. With the first method, it is difficult to 
come up with good estimates of the firm’s free cash flows. It is also 
difficult to come up with how these cash flows will be correlated 
with the market to determine the correct discount rate to apply. 

142
Lecture 18: How to Exploit Mispriced Securities
• 
Typically, professionals look at the required rates of returns on the 
assets—not the equity—of other comparable firms. They do this 
because they want to value the free cash flows of the whole firm. 
When they do that, they typically calculate the weighted average 
cost of capital for the firm. They then estimate the value of the stock 
as the value of the whole firm minus the value of its debt. 
• 
For the second method, you should realize that the alpha from a 
regression is an average value of mispricing. It may not be the alpha 
going forward. In fact, alphas from regressions are notoriously bad. 
They are noisy at the individual security level. 
Step 3: Optimal Portfolios with Active Positions
• 
The Treynor–Black model for active portfolio management 
provides a framework for thinking about how much of your 
portfolio should be active and passive. In addition, it gives you 
some explicit expressions for the magnitudes of the positions you 
should take with securities that you think have nonzero alphas. 
• 
This framework admits that you may be able to beat the market 
by finding mispriced securities. If you could not find mispriced 
securities, then you should just hold a passive market portfolio. 
However, if you can find mispriced securities, then you should 
not do what CAPM says, which is to just hold the market; rather, 
you should supplement a passive position in the market with an 
active portfolio that consists of securities that you have found  
to be mispriced. 
• 
Within this context, there are two things you need to decide: 
What is the optimal active portfolio? And given an optimal 
active portfolio, what is the optimal portfolio of the passive and  
active portfolios? 
• 
First, to form the optimal active portfolio, you need the alpha and 
the idiosyncratic variance of each mispriced security. For each 
security, take the ratio of the alpha to the idiosyncratic variance. 

143
Note that some of these ratios might be negative because the alpha 
for an overvalued security might be negative. 
• 
Add all of these ratios. The weight for the ith mispriced security 
in the active portfolio should be its ratio divided by the sum of 
all of the ratios. These weights seek to exploit nonzero alphas. 
However, at the same time, the weights reflect a concern about the 
idiosyncratic volatility of the security, which is a problem because 
there are typically too few securities in the active portfolio for the 
idiosyncratic components of returns to be diversified away. 
• 
Thus, a big nonzero alpha is good. But a big idiosyncratic volatility 
is bad. A security with an alpha that is relatively large in magnitude 
but that has a small idiosyncratic variance should receive a larger 
weight in the active portfolio. Also note that, because some of the 
ratios might be negative, some portfolio weights might be negative. 
These are the securities you might need to short. 
• 
Once you have the weights for the active portfolio, you will need 
to determine the active portfolio’s beta, alpha, and the variance of 
idiosyncratic components. The beta is just the weighted average of 
the betas of the individual securities—and the same goes for the 
alpha. The variance of the idiosyncratic components is simply the 
weight on each individual security squared times the variance of 
the individual’s idiosyncratic variance—added up for all of the 
mispriced securities in the active portfolio. 
• 
The active portfolio alpha, beta, and idiosyncratic variance are all 
used to answer the following question: What is the right weight to 
put in this active portfolio versus the passive portfolio? 
• 
A first step is to take the ratio of the active portfolio alpha to its 
idiosyncratic variance. Think of this ratio as the extra return (the 
alpha) per unit of idiosyncratic variance. If this ratio is not large, 
then the active portfolio will contribute little in terms of excess 
return but will contribute a lot in terms of idiosyncratic risk. If so, 
you want to put little of your money in the active portfolio. 

144
Lecture 18: How to Exploit Mispriced Securities
• 
Let’s call this ratio the expected return to variance ratio. You 
can also calculate a ratio like it for the market. Let this ratio be 
the expected return on the market divided by the variance of the  
market return. 
• 
To see exactly how much to put in the active portfolio, you want to 
see how big the expected return to variance ratio is for the active 
portfolio relative to the ratio for the market. If this ratio of ratios is 
large, then you should put more in the active portfolio. If the ratio 
of ratios is small, put in less. In some cases, the ratio of ratios will 
be negative. This means that you should short the active portfolio 
you determined in the first step. 
• 
The intuition is that in order to exploit mispricing, you necessarily 
must take an undiversified position in these mispriced securities. 
And when you do, you must bear the risk associated with 
idiosyncratic returns. The amount you want to put into the active 
portfolio should be bigger if the mispricing in these active securities 
is big relative to the amount of idiosyncratic risk these securities 
expose you to.

    Questions to Consider

Lecture 19: Performance Evaluation
Performance Evaluation
Lecture 19
I
n this lecture, you will examine ways in which to evaluate whether active 
investing is actually producing anything useful in terms of expected 
return or risk. That is, the methods discussed in this lecture evaluate the 
performance of a manager’s stimulus-response process. You will look at 
the set of performance metrics used, and you will examine how to interpret 
what they mean. You will also see that you will want to use different metrics 
depending on your specific investment objectives. 
Context Is Important 
• 
What is a good benchmark for evaluating the performance of a 
professional manager? The answer to this question depends on 
the context of that manager or fund in your overall portfolio. Let’s 
consider the situations of Jane and Ichabod. 
• 
Jane is doing her own investing. For this, she has a portfolio that 
consists of individual securities as well as a few passive index 
funds. This portfolio also consists of cash and some investments in 
short-term risk-free investments like certificates of deposit, money 
market deposits, and treasury bills. If you exclude these securities 
and deposits, she has about $2 million in risky stocks, corporate 
bonds, and index funds. She only has $500,000 in short-term 
deposits that are essentially default-free. 
• 
In contrast, Ichabod also has about $2 million in risky investments 
and $500,000 in risk-free deposits. However, he has allocated 
a significant portion of his investments to a couple of actively 
managed funds. In fact, about $1 million is evenly split between 
a global equity fund that invests in the equity of mid- to large-cap 
non-U.S.-based companies and a fund that invests in growth firms 
(those that are fairly early in their life cycle and are still expanding 
operations into new markets). The rest of the $1 million he manages 
by picking stocks he thinks could take off.

147
Jane’s Problem
• 
Jane’s problem is very similar to the typical investor’s problem we 
analyzed when we looked at how to form an optimal risky portfolio 
in Lecture 15. Recall that a risky portfolio consists of just risky 
securities, such as the passive index funds and individual securities 
Jane holds. 
• 
The idea is to form the best risky portfolio, where “best” is 
defined as that which generates the highest return per unit of risk. 
Then, given that optimal risky portfolio, the investor can control 
the amount of risk by deciding how much of the wealth to put 
in that risky portfolio and how much to keep in safe deposits or  
risk-free bonds. 
• 
In Jane’s case, she should pick a portfolio that maximizes the 
Sharpe ratio. Thus, the appropriate evaluation criterion for Jane’s 
risky portfolio is the Sharpe ratio; she should compare the Sharpe 
ratio of her risky portfolio to that of the global benchmark.
• 
If the Sharpe ratio of her portfolio is less than that of the benchmark, 
then she could try to improve her risky portfolio by changing the 
amount allocated to the two passive funds and the individual stocks 
she owns. 
• 
The material in Lecture 15 should guide her decisions in this 
regard. However, the bottom line is that because the risky portfolio 
she is forming is the only overall risky portfolio she will hold, she 
should evaluate the performance of that portfolio (and alternatives) 
according to the Sharpe ratio. 
Ichabod’s Problem 
• 
Ichabod’s situation is a bit more complicated than Jane’s because 
he has a few actively managed funds. That is, he has delegated the 
management of a portion of his portfolio to what are supposed to be 
two actively managed funds. 

148
Lecture 19: Performance Evaluation
• 
He wants to get the extra boost from active management, but 
he also wants to be sure that he is not overpaying for the extra 
performance these funds provide. So, he needs to be able to measure  
their performance. 
• 
What would constitute good performance in this case? Should 
he look at the Sharpe ratio for each fund? These numbers are 
commonly provided by fund managers—but is that the right metric 
in this case? Is what the Sharpe ratio measures really what he  
wants conceptually? 
• 
Recall that the Sharpe ratio is the expected return of the portfolio 
minus the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation. The 
Sharpe ratio is really an ex ante measure. That is, at the time the 
portfolio is being formed, the investor is supposed to pick the 
weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio. It is ex ante in the sense 
that the expected return and the standard deviation are conceptually 
related to things the investor expects to hold in the future. 
• 
The Sharpe ratios that are reported in the financial press and on 
websites are an ex post measure. With these measures, the expected 
return minus the risk-free rate is the average excess return for that 
portfolio over some past period of time (for example, 5 to 10 years). 
The standard deviation is calculated as the standard deviation of the 
returns that occurred in the past. 
• 
Using Sharpe ratios calculated in this way, most investors would 
rank managers from highest (or best) to lowest (or worst). But 
note that this measure is backward looking. You need to look for 
persistence in the Sharpe ratios over time, so compare the Sharpe 
ratios for a given manager over many years. 
• 
Is this even the correct measure of what Ichabod cares about? This 
measure is supposed to be what you want to maximize when finding 
the optimal portfolio of risky securities only. His overall portfolio 
(which includes both risky investments and risk-free deposits) will 
have the highest amount of return per unit of risk if the portfolio 

149
of risky securities has a large Sharpe ratio. Once he has such a 
risky portfolio defined, he can then determine, given the risk of that 
portfolio, how much he wants to put at risk and how much he wants 
to keep safe. 
• 
Thus, there are two overall questions: What is the best risky 
portfolio? And what fraction of his wealth does he feel comfortable 
putting at risk given that best risky portfolio? If he were to evaluate 
each of the managed funds by looking at their Sharpe ratios, for 
each actively managed portfolio, he would learn how much 
expected return per unit of risk each portfolio generates—if that 
was the only risky portfolio that he held. 
• 
Thus, the Sharpe ratio for a given portfolio is sensible only if it 
is the only portfolio held. If the portfolio you are evaluating is 
the only risky portfolio you will hold, then the standard deviation 
in the Sharpe ratio is the risk the investor holds. However, if the 
investor holds two actively managed portfolios, then the standard 
deviation of the overall portfolio will be some combination of the 
two individual standard deviations. 
• 
The real question Ichabod wants answered is as follows: How much 
extra return does the actively managed fund contribute to his overall 
portfolio relative to the extra risk that portfolio contributes to his 
overall portfolio? That is not what the Sharpe ratio tells Ichabod. 
Note that because Jane only has one risky portfolio, the Sharpe ratio 
of that portfolio does tell her what her return per unit of risk is. 
Three Measures of Risk
• 
There are a few measures that are used to get at what Ichabod wants 
to know. One such measure is the Treynor measure. Because the 
standard deviation of the portfolio’s return does not measure risk 
in a portfolio context, the Treynor measure replaces the standard 
deviation by the beta of the portfolio: That is, the Treynor measure 
is the expected return on the portfolio minus the risk-free rate 
divided by the beta of that portfolio. 

150
Lecture 19: Performance Evaluation
• 
Thus, the Treynor measure captures the extra excess return that 
portfolio provides given the risk of that portfolio as measured 
by the portfolio’s beta. The beta of an individual security—or 
an individual portfolio—is the incremental contribution of that 
security to the risk of the portfolio. Thus, the beta of a portfolio 
Ichabod holds should be the extra risk that portfolio contributes to 
his overall risky portfolio.
• 
Another measure of the contribution of a managed portfolio to 
the overall performance of the risky portfolio that adjusts for that 
managed portfolio’s risk is Jensen’s alpha. Jensen’s alpha is a 
measure of the extent to which that portfolio return exceeds that 
which it should be according to CAPM. Specifically, Jensen’s alpha 
is the average return on the portfolio minus the average of the risk-
adjusted expected return. 
• 
In general, the risk-adjusted expected return is the expected return 
implied by a particular asset pricing model. If we use CAPM, then 
the risk-adjusted expected return on the portfolio is the risk-free 
rate plus the beta of that portfolio times the market return minus the 
risk-free rate. 

151
• 
For any period in the past, you can calculate the risk-adjusted 
expected return by taking the risk-free rate for that period and 
adding the beta of the portfolio multiplied by whatever the market 
return minus the risk-free rate was in that period. Think of this 
value as the value that the CAPM implies should have happened 
on average. 
• 
For any given period, the difference between the realized return on 
the portfolio in that period and the risk-adjusted expected return in 
that period is the alpha for that period. Jensen’s alpha is just the 
average of the alpha for all the past periods. 
• 
There is another measure that is similar to the Treynor measure 
based on leverage called the M2 measure (after Modigliani and 
Miller, two Nobel Prize winners in economics/finance). Their idea 
is to consider the amount of volatility in a passive market portfolio 
and lever up or down the managed portfolio until that position has 
the same volatility as the market. 
• 
Once you have that position, you can compare the expected return 
on that position to that of the market. If the managed position 
dominates, invest in that—not the market. 
The Information Ratio 
• 
Why should Ichabod just hold one managed fund? In fact, most 
managed funds are actively managed knowing that investors will 
not hold them as their only risky portfolio. If they know that they 
are going to be held with other active funds in a portfolio of funds, 
what performance measure do they want to compete on? Each fund 
will want to in high demand as a component of an overall optimally 
formed portfolio of risky securities. 
• 
When how to form the optimal risky portfolio on the basis of 
any active analysis was discussed, we noted that there was a  
trade-off between the alpha and the idiosyncratic volatility of active 
positions in the securities or portfolio. The information ratio is the 
ratio of the alpha to the idiosyncratic volatility. The reason this is 

152
Lecture 19: Performance Evaluation
the right metric is because of the following mathematical fact from  
portfolio math.

• 
The variable Snew is the Sharpe ratio for a “new” portfolio that 
optimally mixes in a position in active securities into a passive 
portfolio. Active securities are ones that have nonzero alphas. 
These are the securities that either you or a professional manager 
has spent time researching; they are the ones that appear to be 
under- or overvalued. Spassive is the Sharpe ratio for the passive 
market portfolio. The last term is the square of the ratio of the active 
portfolio’s alpha to the standard deviation of its idiosyncratic terms. 
• 
The expression says that an active portfolio will contribute to 
the overall trade-off between return and risk of the overall risky 
portfolio—as measured by the Sharpe ratio of the “new” portfolio.
• 
Recall that when we discussed the optimal mixture of active and 
passive positions, we divided the optimal risky portfolio into two 
parts: a passive part (consisting of as broad a portfolio as possible) 
and a portfolio of active investigated securities. By adding in the 
active portfolio, the Sharpe ratio will rise above what the purely 
passive part generates on its own.
• 
The amount the active portfolio adds to the Sharpe ratio of the 
passive portfolio is related to the alpha on that active portfolio 
divided by the idiosyncratic volatility of that active portfolio. This 
ratio is the information ratio. Thus, an actively managed fund with a 
high information ratio will increase your overall portfolio’s Sharpe 
ratio significantly.

Lecture 20: Market Making and Liquidity
Market Making and Liquidity
Lecture 20
W
hat is liquidity? And should you be willing to pay for it? If so, 
how much? In this lecture, you will explore these questions. 
First, you will examine exactly what financial economists mean 
by liquidity. Then, you will examine the things that determine whether the 
market for a particular security is liquid. Next, you will examine how to 
measure the liquidity of a security. Finally, you will learn how to think about 
whether you should be willing to pay the market price for liquidity. 
Liquidity
• 
Liquidity is typically defined in two dimensions: the time and the 
price dimension. A liquid security is one that can be turned into 
cash (i.e., liquidated) very quickly and without having the price fall 
significantly. If, keeping the price fixed, it takes a long time to find a 
buyer at that price, that security is not very liquid. And, if, keeping 
the time over which you must liquidate fixed, you have to drop the 
price by a lot to get a buyer, then that security is not very liquid. 
• 
Over time, the liquidity of most securities has increased. In fact, for 
many stocks traded on organized exchanges, you can sell a stock in 
seconds while only pushing the average transaction price down by 
a penny. 
• 
In exchanges, there are two forms of transactions costs: the bid-ask 
spread and brokerage fees. The brokerage fee is what you pay for a 
broker to execute your trade. Brokerage fees are small, and they are 
getting smaller. 
• 
The second cost is the bid-ask spread. At any point in time, there 
are two prices for any security. If you, as an investor, want to buy, 
you will pay the ask price. If you, as an investor, want to sell, you 
will sell at the bid price. 

155
• 
The ask price you pay when buying is always above the bid price 
you get when selling. The difference between the bid and the ask 
is the bid-ask spread. At any given time, the bid and the ask prices 
bracket the market’s best guess at the fundamental value of the 
security. Thus, if you buy at the ask, you have to pay above the 
fundamental value, and if you sell at the bid, you get less than the 
fundamental value. 
• 
At any point in time, there are many prices being offered or bid at 
in the market for any security. These prices are from limit orders, 
which are price-contingent orders that specify the price at which the 
person who submitted the order is willing to trade. There are limit 
orders to sell and limit orders to buy. 
• 
The set of limit sells are the current set of ask, or offer, prices. 
These are the prices at which someone, mostly securities dealers, 
is willing to sell the security. That is, they are the prices the dealers 
are asking buyers to pay. They are also called offer prices because 
they are the prices at which they are offering to sell.
• 
The unfilled limit buy orders that remain constitute the set of bid 
prices, the prices at which various dealers are willing to buy the 
security. They are called bid prices because they are the prices the 
dealers are bidding. 
• 
Among the set of bid and ask prices there is a best ask, which is 
the lowest ask price. It is “best” from the perspective of someone 
wanting to buy. The lower the ask, the lower the price the buyer has 
to pay the dealer who is posting that ask. Similarly, at any point in 
time, there is also a best—i.e., highest—bid price. The difference 
between the best ask and the best bid is the bid-ask spread. 
• 
Limit orders are typically placed by dealers trying to take advantage 
of a temporary lack of either supply or demand at a specific point in 
time. Many dealers place limit orders on both sides of the market. 

156
Lecture 20: Market Making and Liquidity
• 
An alternative to a limit order is a market order. Such orders are 
submitted by investors either wanting to invest in a security or 
wanting to liquidate an existing position in a security. Such an order 
simply says that you are willing to transact—either buy or sell—at 
the going price. That is, it is not an order that specifies a particular 
price contingency as with a limit order. If you place a market order, 
your order is filled at the highest available bid if you are selling and 
at the lowest available ask if you are buying. 
• 
So, with a market order, the good news is that if you are selling, you 
get to sell at the highest available bid, and if you are buying, you 
only have to pay the lowest available ask. However, with a market 
order, the bad news is that the highest bid is below the lowest ask. 
Therefore, when you buy, you have to pay more than you would get 
if you were selling. 
• 
With a limit order, the person who submitted the order specifies the 
amount they are willing to trade at the specified price (or better). 
Thus, because the best bid and the best ask are limit orders, there 
are a number of shares or units of the security that the dealers are 
willing to trade at each of these price points. The total number of 
shares at each price is called the depth at that price. 
• 
Note that that depth can be comprised of a single bid or offer from 
a single dealer or multiple bids or offers from multiple dealers. For 
most trades, the number of units of the security people want to buy 
or sell is smaller than the depth at the highest bid or the lowest ask. 
• 
In that case, if you submit a market order, your whole order will get 
transacted at that highest bid or lowest ask. However, if you want 
to trade quantities bigger than those being offered at the highest bid 
or the lowest ask, then your order will get filled at multiple prices. 
Bid-Ask Spreads and Liquidity
• 
In this context, liquidity is immediacy. If you want to buy now, you 
will place a market order. And you will have to pay what the limit 
order sellers are willing to take—and that is above the fundamental 

157
value of the security. If you 
want to sell now, you have 
to sell it for what the limit 
order buyers are willing to 
pay—and that’s below the 
fundamental value. 
• 
A good way to think about 
the 
difference 
between 
the bids and asks is that it 
compensates the dealers 
who are placing limits for 
providing liquidity. They 
are allowing people to get 
immediacy. And they get 
paid to provide immediacy 
by being able to sell 
above 
the 
fundamental 
value and buy below the  
fundamental value. 
• 
From the perspective of someone demanding immediacy, the more 
they have to pay above the fundamental value, the less liquid the 
security, and the farther below the fundamental value they get when 
they sell, the less liquid. 
• 
Again from the perspective of someone demanding immediacy, the 
liquidity cost is the size of the difference between the transaction 
price and the fundamental value. It is half of the effective bid-ask 
spread, which is, for a given quantity, the difference between what 
you would pay to get that quantity versus what you could sell that 
quantity for. 
• 
If there were not much depth below the best bid, then a larger 
market sell order would transact at an average price below the best 
bid. Similarly, a larger market buy order would pay an average 
price above the best ask. The less depth, the worse the execution is. 

158
Lecture 20: Market Making and Liquidity
• 
The spread between the best bid and best ask is not a true indication 
of the liquidity cost for larger orders, unless there is significant 
depth at the best bid and best ask. Thus, a liquid market is where 
there are many dealers willing to buy at the highest bid and many 
dealers willing to sell at the lowest ask—and there is only a small 
difference between that bid and ask. 
• 
There can be fairly large variation in the liquidity of various 
securities. Large household names, such as Procter & Gamble and 
Microsoft, have very small bid-ask spreads, while other securities 
that are less frequently traded can have little depth and fairly large 
bid-ask spreads.
• 
Because there are multiple dealers that compete with each other, 
the spread can be thought of as the competitive price of liquidity. 
Competition should drive the price of liquidity down to the cost of 
supplying it.

Fundamental Risk and Adverse Selection
• 
Financial economists have divided the spread into two main logical 
components based on the source of the cost to dealer of supplying 
liquidity. There are two types of costs: fundamental risk and  
adverse selection.

159
• 
Fundamental risk is the risk that the fundamental value of the 
security will change significantly at any moment in time. This 
represents a risk to a dealer because dealers make money by buying 
low (at the bid) and selling high (at the ask). 
• 
Adverse selection is the risk faced by a dealer that the traders will 
systematically select trades that are adverse to the dealer. Adverse 
selection occurs when traders have superior information about the 
value of the security.
• 
Again, fundamental risk and adverse selection are the two costs. 
The bigger any of these costs are, the bigger the competitive 
spreads must be. Thus, securities with more fundamental risk 
have wider spreads. Securities with lots of adverse selection have 
wider spreads. The securities with the most adverse selection 
and the widest spreads are securities that are not traded by many 
uninformed investors. The stocks of small companies are like this. 
Measuring Liquidity 
• 
The liquidity cost of a security cannot be measured solely by the 
difference in the best bid and best ask. Of course, if that spread is 
wide, that security is not liquid. However, at any moment in time, 
this spread may be narrow, but there may be little depth at these 
quotes. In this case, a sizable market order to sell will push the price 
way down, and a sizable market order to buy can push the price 
way up. 
• 
A measure developed by Yakov Amihud, referred to as the Amihud 
measure, is a measure of the liquidity of an individual security 
that incorporates depth. The Amihud measure is the average of 
the absolute value of the daily price change divided by the dollar 
volume in that day. Note that this is really an illiquidity measure, 
because higher values of this measure indicate an illiquid market, 
or one in which the prices change by a lot for a given amount of  
trade volume. 

160
Lecture 20: Market Making and Liquidity
• 
This measure is calculated as follows: For every trade day in a 
month, take the absolute value of the price change that day divided 
by the dollar amount of trade in that security for that day. Then, 
take these values and average them over the 20 or so trading days in 
the month. That is the Amihud measure for that month. 
• 
Academic research has shown that the Amihud measure varies 
significantly across securities. It also shows that the less liquid a 
security is, the higher its return is on average. This makes sense in 
that liquidity costs will erode your return. Thus, investors appear 
to be willing to pay less for less liquid securities than more liquid 
securities. This lowering of the price generates a higher return. 
• 
You can think of the effect that liquidity costs have on the return 
as being the amount the average person needs to be compensated 
in extra return in order to compensate for the average amount of 
liquidity costs they incur given the average length of time they 
intend to hold that security. If you intend to hold the security for 
longer than the average investor, then the return per period is more 
than enough to compensate you for the liquidity costs you will 
incur. But if you intend to hold it for a shorter period of time, the 
extra return will likely be insufficient.

Understanding Derivatives
Lecture 21
I
n this lecture on derivative securities, you will begin by learning what 
a derivative security is. You will then examine two prevalent examples: 
puts and calls. You will also learn when it is optimal to exercise an 
option. In addition, you will be introduced to payoff and profit diagrams 
to understand how the profit on an option depends on the future value of 
the underlying. Finally, you will examine how a lack of transparency in 
over-the-counter CDS transactions contributed to the instability during the 
financial crisis of 2008. 
Derivative Securities 
• 
Derivative securities come in many forms. For example, there are 
futures, options, swaps, and swaptions (options on swaps). At the 
most basic level, a derivative security is a contract that specifies 
payouts contingent on—or derived from—the values of other 
securities or goods. The types of other securities can be equity, 
fixed income (or bonds), commodities (like gold or soy beans), and 
currency (like the Japanese yen).
• 
One type of derivative security is an option. Once you understand 
options, you can understand the basics of almost all of the other 
derivative securities that exist. There are two basic types of 
option contracts: put options and call options (or, simply, puts  
and calls).
• 
As with any financial contract, with puts and calls, there are 
always two parties involved: the buyer and the seller. The seller 
is sometimes referred to as the “writer” of the contract. When one 
sells a put or a call, they write the contract. 
• 
When a buyer buys a contract, he or she pays for the option 
to require the seller to do a particular thing (as specified in the 
contract) at some future date. The buyer has an option in the sense 

163
that he or she does not have to require the seller to do that particular 
thing; rather, the buyer has the option to ignore the contract and rip 
it up if he or she wants to. 
• 
In contrast, the seller of the option is obligated to satisfy the buyer 
if the buyer chooses to exercise his or her option in the future. That 
is, the seller must honor whatever the buyer wants—even if the 
buyer wants to ignore the contract. Thus, options have one-sided 
commitment. 
• 
With options, there are many different words or phrases used to 
describe or denote the same thing. Options professionals often refer 
to the buyer as being “long” or “having a long position,” while a 
seller is “short” or “has a short position.” That is, because the seller 
is obligated to make good on the promise in the future, the seller is 
short that obligation. Also, the buyer is sometimes referred to as the 
“holder” of the option. 
• 
The difference between a put option and a call option is with 
respect to the specific action the buyer has the option to take in the 
future. A call contract gives the buyer of the call the “option”—
not the obligation—to buy a prespecified security in the future for a 
prespecified price. The call option gives its owner the right to “call 
in”—or buy—some security in the future. The owner of the option 
doesn’t have to if they don’t want to, but they can if they do. Either 
way, the seller must honor the wishes of the holder. 
Calls
• 
There are three important items a call contract must specify: Which 
security can be called in the future? At what price can it be bought 
for? When can it be called in? To answer the first question, the call 
contract specifies the security that the option is written on, which 
is also referred to as the underlying asset—that is, the asset whose 
value the option is derived from.
• 
Underlying assets can be equity (such as IBM), bonds (such as 
treasury bonds), currency (such as yen), commodities (such as live 

164
Lecture 21: Understanding Derivatives
cattle), indexes (such as the S&P 500), and other derivate contracts 
(such as futures). 
• 
To answer the second question, the call contract specifies the 
exercise price, which is the price that the holder of the call has 
to pay for the security (for example, IBM) if he or she chooses to 
exercise the option. The exercise price is also called the strike price.
• 
Finally, to answer the third question, the contract specifies the 
expiration date for the option. In this regard, there are multiple types 
of options: “European” options are those that can be exercised only 
on the expiration date, while “American” options can be exercised 
any time on or before the expiration date. 
• 
It is often useful to depict the payoffs on an option as a function of 
the strike price and the price of the underlying asset at expiration. A 
payoff diagram depicts the payoff per share of the underlying that 
a person receives at the expiration date as a function of the price of 
the underlying on the expiration date. 

165
• 
A payoff diagram does not consider what was paid for the option 
initially. A profit diagram considers the initial cost of the option 
by shifting down the graphs by the amount of this cost. While it 
is traditional to do this, realize that it is not quite accurate because 
the cost is incurred at a time prior to expiration. Thus, a traditional 
profit diagram ignores the time value of money. 
• 
Options are what economists call a zero-sum game. The amount one 
person gains is the amount the other person losses. Furthermore, 
rather than actually transacting in the underlying security, most 
options are cash settled. 
Puts 
• 
Rather than giving the holder the option to buy, a put gives the 
holder the option to sell a specific security at a specific price on or 
before a specific date. As with a call, the put also has a strike price 
and an expiration date. In addition, puts can be either American  
or European. 
• 
Unlike with calls, the holder of a put benefits when the value of 
the underlying security falls below the strike price. That is, the put 
holder can force the writer to buy the underlying security for more 
than it’s worth. 
• 
If the underlying security’s value is higher than the strike price at 
expiration, then the put holder would choose not to sell the security 
for that lower strike price. In that case, the holder lets the put  
expire unexercised. 
Mortgages
• 
Options are everywhere. For example, if you have a mortgage, 
you actually have two options: a prepayment option and a default 
option. The prepayment option is an American option that lets the 
borrower swap the promised stream of monthly payments for the 
amount of the remaining principle, the present value of the amount 
that is left to be paid. This allows the borrower to move. 

166
Lecture 21: Understanding Derivatives
• 
It also allows the borrower to act strategically and refinance to his 
or her benefit. If interest rates fall, then the borrower can borrow the 
remaining principle by making smaller monthly payments. So, he 
or she would do that and use the borrowed money to exercise his or 
her prepayment option and repay the current loan. If interest rates 
rise, he or she won’t refinance (and will continue to enjoy the low 
rate on the current mortgage). 
• 
A mortgage borrower also has a default option: If the value of the 
home drops below the remaining principle owned, the borrower 
has the option to “put” the house for the amount owed. That is, the 
borrower can get out from under the mortgage contract simply by 
giving the house to the lender. This is just like a put option where 
the borrower forces the lender to buy the house for a strike price 
equal to the remaining principle. 
• 
Options are valuable; people just don’t hand them out for free. So, 
because the mortgage borrower receives two options with his or her 
loan, the price of the loan—the interest rate charged—reflects the 
cost of the lender of providing the borrower with these two options. 
• 
Thus, mortgage rates would be lower if the law did not give 
borrowers the option to prepay and to default. Of course, this is 
only a problem if, given the choice, borrowers would voluntarily 
give up these options in order to get lower rates. 
• 
Leading up to the financial crisis of 2008, many new mortgages 
were originated in which the borrowers put very little (if any) 
money down. In these cases, the loan-to-value ratios—the ratio of 
the amount borrowed to the value of the property—were close to 
one. 
• 
So, for many mortgages, the principle was very close to the value 
of the home purchased. As a result, in many cases, it took only a 
small decline in the value of the home to make the default option  
“in the money.” 

167
• 
Another feature of options relevant to the financial crisis is the 
difference between exchange-traded options and those traded “over 
the counter.” Standardized option contracts are traded at exchanges. 
Non-standardized options are negotiated and traded among people 
in what is referred to as the over-the-counter market. 
• 
Over-the-counter markets are not transparent and were not 
regulated. While the exchanges have procedures that guard against 
the seller of the options reneging on their obligation, no such 
safeguards existed in the over-the-counter market. Rather, the 
over-the-counter market relies on relationships and trust built over 
repeated transactions.
• 
Moreover, there was no central clearinghouse that kept track of the 
size of the positions individuals or institutions have. Without this 
knowledge, there is something called counter-party risk, which is 
the risk that the trading party with the obligation (i.e., the option 
writer) will not be able to fulfill their obligations. 
CDOs and CDSs 
• 
Options were also thought to be a big contributor to the financial 
crisis of 2008. Aside from the default options that mortgage 
borrowers exercised, there were other derivative securities called 
credit default swaps (CDSs) that were written on another kind of 
derivative security called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), 
which are bonds that are backed by the payments on bonds. 
• 
Many CDOs were backed by the payments on mortgage loans. 
CDOs would take the payments from a pool of mortgages. They 
would then use the mortgages as collateral to sell bonds. Some of 
the bonds sold would be short term in nature. So, most of the cash 
coming from the mortgages would be used to pay those bonds off 
first. Other bonds were longer term in nature. These different bonds 
are called tranches. 

168
Lecture 21: Understanding Derivatives
• 
CDOs are complex because whether a longer-term tranche 
gets any payments depends on the defaults in the pool of the 
underlying collateral—mortgages, for example. And the defaults 
on the mortgages depend on the strike prices on the default 
options in the mortgages in the pool, which in turn depend on the  
loan-to-value ratio. 
• 
A credit default swap (CDS) is an option to swap a defaulted 
bond for its face value. This is a put option. It allows the buyer 
of the option to insure against default. The buyer of the instrument 
acquires protection from the seller against a default by a particular 
company or country (the reference entity). The premium is known 
as the credit default spread. It is paid for the life of the contract 
or until default. If there is a default, the buyer has the right to sell 
bonds for its face value.
• 
Prior to the financial crisis, many mortgages where bundled 
together to create CDOs. Then, those institutions (many banks and 
pension funds) that bought CDOs also bought credit protection in 
the form of CDSs. 
• 
However, because CDSs were not transparent, there was a surprise 
when AIG, who sold sizable amounts of CDSs, experienced such 
significant losses that it would have failed had it not been bailed 
out by the U.S. government. When the company that insures you 
against default defaults, you have no insurance. In order to prevent 
systemic failure, the United States bailed out the insurer—so that 
others would be insured.

1.	 There is a saying that options are valuable; this is certainly true with 
financial options because you will only exercise them if you get a 
better payoff than if you were to let them expire unexercised. Can you 
think of nonfinancial situations in which having more options might be 
detrimental? How are these situations different from the situation with a 
financial option? 
2.	 In earlier lectures, we discussed “plain vanilla” bonds, which are 
securities that promise you a set of fixed payments. But there exist some 
non-plain-vanilla bonds that have option-like features. For example, 
there are convertible bonds and callable bonds. With a convertible bond, 
the owner of the bond (the investor) can, during some prespecified period 
of time during the life of the bond, convert a bond into a prespecified 
number of shares of equity in the firm. With a callable bond, the firm 
that sold the bond has the option to buy back the bond for a prespecified 
price (e.g., the face value of the bond) during a specified period. If 
everything else about the bond is the same, will callable bonds be more 
or less expensive than a similar plain vanilla bond? Will the yield to 
maturity be higher or lower? Also, what about the price and yield to 
maturity on a convertible bond relative to a similar plain vanilla bond? 
    Questions to Consider

170
Lecture 22: Using Derivatives
Using Derivatives
Lecture 22
T
he previous lecture described the elements of options and the nature 
of their payoffs and profits. In this lecture, you will learn how you 
can use options as part of your investment strategy. In particular, 
you will examine two ways that you can use them. You can use them to 
speculate, exploiting the fact that options are like highly levered positions in 
the underlying asset. You can also use options to control risk, or hedge. 
Speculation
• 
Speculation can be very risky. A person is speculating when he or 
she is betting on the security moving in a particular direction. For 
example, suppose that you are reading the paper and find out that 
the fees for the disposal of used oil from deep fryers is likely to fall 
in the near future. If so, then the values of U.S. fast food companies, 
including McDonald’s, are likely to rise, reflecting higher  
future profits. 
• 
If you currently owned stock in McDonald’s, then you would be 
happy. But if you didn’t own any stock in McDonald’s, you could 
do two things: You could either go buy some stock or you could 
speculate with options. By speculating with options, you can 
amplify your gains—and your losses, too. 
• 
If you really know which way the price of the underlying is going 
to move, then you may want to use options. If you think prices will 
rise, buy a call. If you think prices will fall, you could either short 
or buy a put. The analysis of these cases is exactly analogous to 
the “buy” or “buy a call” analysis with a price rise. Speculating 
with options is very similar to speculating with borrowed money  
(or leverage). 

171
• 
Buying a call is very similar to an extremely levered position in 
the underlying. Your returns are very sensitive to the return on the 
underlying. The same is true with the purchase of a put. 
• 
You can also speculate by selling puts and calls. Rather than 
speculate that the price will rise by buying a call or speculate the 
price will fall by buying a put, you might sell a call to speculate that 
the price will stand still or fall, or you might sell a put to speculate 
that the price will stand still or rise. With this kind of speculation, 
you are just selling options to get the money—betting that the 
prices won’t move in such a direction that the buyer will want to 
exercise them.
• 
When AIG sold credit default swaps, they were selling put options 
on bonds. One view is that they just wanted to make the money 
by selling the protection; they never thought that the puts they sold 
would be exercised. But they were wrong.
• 
Another type of speculative strategy is a kind where you bet on 
volatility. Consider the following strategy, where you combine puts 
and calls: Buy a call with strike X for $c; buy a put with strike X 
for $p. This strategy is called a straddle. What will you get as a 
function of the price of the underlying at expiration? 
• 
To figure out what you get, draw a profit diagram for each position. 
Recall that the profit diagram plots the profit on the vertical axis as 
a function of the price of the underlying at expiration. Once you 
plot the profit for each, then you add each line vertically. 
• 
The profit on the call will be a flat line from $0 to the strike at $X. 
Because you will have paid $c, this flat line is drawn at a height 
of −$c on the vertical axis. Then, for every dollar the price at 
expiration is above the strike, the profit will rise $1. Thus, at the 
point on the profit line at the strike price, the profit line slopes up $1 
for every $1 above the strike. 

172
Lecture 22: Using Derivatives
• 
The profit diagram for the call looks like a hockey stick with its 
handle up in the air to the right. For the put, it’s also a hockey 
stick—but with its handle up in the air to the left. The level of the 
flat part is at −$p. 
• 
Next, let’s add them. 
The best way to do 
this is to simply start 
at the strike and add 
the two levels of the 
profits. If the price 
of the underlying 
at expiration is X, 
then you will not 
exercise either the 
put or the call, and 
your “profit” will be 
−($c + $p). 
• 
What if the price is 
$1 lower than the 
strike X? Then, the 
call will be worth 
what it was at X—
but the put will be 
worth $1 more than 
it was at X. Thus, the profit line rises $1 from what it was at X. For 
every dollar the price falls below the strike, the profit line rises $1. 
Thus, to the left of the strike, the profit line rises $1 for $1. 
• 
Next, consider what the profit line looks like when the price of the 
underlying is above the strike at expiration. At X, it is at −($c + $p). 
As we move to the right, the call starts to pay off $1 for $1. The put 
is now worthless. So, combined, for every $1 above X, the line rises 
$1. What you get is a combined profit that is a V shape, with the 
bottom of the V at a profit of −($c + $p), the cost of the put and call. 

173
• 
Note that if the price of the underlying ends up far away from 
X, then you will make positive profits. However, if the price of 
the underlying ends up close to the strike, you lose. Typically, 
speculators would do this with “at the money” puts and calls. 
This strategy is designed to speculate on lots of volatility in  
the underlying. 
• 
With “just-call” or “just-put” strategies, we speculate that the price 
will move in one direction: up for calls; down for puts. The straddle 
strategy is used to speculate when you don’t have any idea which 
way the underlying will move—you just think it’s going to move  
a lot. 
• 
However, realize that the prices of both puts and calls increase with 
the market’s belief about volatility. If you think volatility is high, 
the market may think so, too. And if the prices of puts and calls 
rise, the bottom of the V falls. And the distance the price of the 
underlying must travel away from X before your straddle becomes 
profitable increases. Thus, you are less likely to make money.
• 
Another speculative strategy is called a butterfly spread. This 
strategy has you combine long and short positions in calls with 
different strikes. There are put versions, too. 
Hedging 
• 
In addition to speculating, another type of strategy you can do 
with options is hedging. A hedge is something you do to soften the 
blow from something bad. This is in contrast to speculation, which 
amplifies your returns. 
• 
When you use options to hedge, you must already have some 
exposure to some risks that affect the value of the option’s 
underlying security. A very common and effective hedging strategy 
is the protective put strategy. The best way to think about this 
strategy is that it is a side bet that pays off when things go bad  
for you. 

174
Lecture 22: Using Derivatives
• 
The protective put acts as insurance. In fact, it is just like insurance 
against an accident. As with insurance, the policy only pays off 
when you have an accident. And if you don’t have an accident, you 
still have to pay the premium. Thus, with the protective put, the 
premium is the price of the put. 
• 
You can wait until expiration to exercise a put, but you don’t have to 
wait. With this approach, you take a position in an option such that 
when a bad thing happens to you, the price of the option rises. And 
when a good thing happens to you, the price of the option falls. The 
delta is the amount the option price changes (prior to expiration) 
given a change in the value of the underlying. The magnitude of 
option deltas is less than 1 prior to expiration. 
• 
The intuition is as follows: The value of the option is related to the 
likelihood it will be in the money at expiration and, conditional on 
it being in the money, how far it will be in the money at expiration. 
• 
Thus, for a call, as the value of the underlying rises, both the 
likelihood it will be in the money and the amount it will be in the 
money increase. This is true because it is either closer to being in 
the money or it is farther in the money already. As a result, the value 
of the call rises. Conversely, as the value of the underlying falls, the 
value of the call falls.
• 
A similar argument can be made for puts. For a put, as the value of 
the underlying rises, both the likelihood it will be in the money and 
the amount it will be in the money decrease. It is either farther away 
from being in the money or it is less in the money already. This 
results in the value of the put falling. Conversely, as the value of the 
underlying falls, the value of the put rises.
• 
But how much does the option price change given a change in the 
value of the underlying? Because it is not for certain going to be in 
the money at expiration, the option price does not change dollar for 
dollar with the underlying. However, the magnitude of delta gets 

175
closer to 1 the closer is it to being in the money and the farther it is 
in the money. The magnitude of the delta is smaller the farther it is

1.	 Consider the following combination of options, called a butterfly spread: 
Consider call options written on the same underlying security, but with 
3 different strike prices (e.g., $95, $100, and $105); buy 1 call with 
the strike of $95, buy 1 call with the strike of $105, and short 2 calls 
with the strike of $100. What is the payoff on this set of positions as a 
function of the price of the underlying at expiration? If you were to use 
this strategy to speculate, what would you be speculating will happen? 
2.	 Consider two call options, one that is way in the money and the other 
that is way out of the money. Which one will have a larger delta? What 
about for way-in-the-money and way-out-of-the-money puts?

his lecture will examine two models used to price options: the 
binomial method and the Black–Scholes method. Both are based 
on risk-neutral pricing, which is based on being able to perfectly 
replicate the option payoffs with the underlying and risk-free bonds. Recent 
developments have noted that in some cases, you cannot fully replicate 
the payoffs. As a result, people may pay a premium over these risk-neutral 
valuation prices in order to achieve the sure downside protection from a 
put. However, the Black–Scholes and binomial methods serve as a good 
benchmark. Furthermore, both are used extensively. 
Pricing 
• 
Let’s compare two calls that are identical except that one has a 
higher strike price than the other. The one with the higher strike 
price is less valuable: It is less likely to end up in the money, and if 
it does, the one with the lower strike will be more in the money than 
the one with the higher strike. 
• 
Next, let’s compare two calls or puts that are identical except that 
they expire at different times: The one with the longer time to 
expiration will be worth more than the one with the shorter time to 
expiration. The one that is alive for longer has a greater chance of 
meandering around until it ends up in the money. 
• 
Finally, let’s compare the value of a put or call when the volatility 
is low to the value when the volatility is high. As with the time to 
expiration, the greater the volatility, the more likely it is that the 
underlying will end up at an extreme point—which half the time 
will be in the money. 

177
• 
Thus, the greater the volatility, the greater the value of the option. 
This holds for both puts and calls because volatility increases the 
chance of both big drops and big increases. A natural question to 
ask is how much bigger the price of the option should be for a given 
increase in volatility. 
• 
Also, what is an appropriate price period? Say you want to buy 
protection from downside risk by buying a put (recall the protective 
put strategy). What is a fair price to pay for that protection? This is 
exactly the same question you’d ask when buying car insurance—
so why not ask it with respect to options? 
• 
So, how do you price an option? The pricing techniques discussed 
in this lecture price options relative to other securities traded in 
the market. The key insight of these pricing models is that you 
can build structures out of existing securities that behave just like  
the option. 
• 
If that is true, then it must be the case that the option value is 
exactly the same as the cost of the so-called replicating strategy. If 
the values of the option and its replicating strategy are not the same, 
then there is an arbitrage opportunity, which is when two things 
that are the same have different prices or values. To exploit, buy the 
cheap one and sell the expensive one. 
• 
For options, you will learn how to form a portfolio of the underlying 
asset and risk-free bonds that replicates the payoffs on the option. 
Thus, the cost of the replicating portfolio must equal the price of 
the option. 
The Binomial Model
• 
With the binomial, we need to make what will initially appear to be 
a very tenuous assumption. However, although seemingly crazy, it 
really is not that bad. And it is a very powerful assumption, because 
it lets us price options in many situations. 

178
Lecture 23: Pricing Derivatives
• 
The big assumption is that at any point in time, over the next 
interval of time, the price of the underlying can only take on two 
values. This is why it is called the binomial model—“bi,” meaning 
“two,” refers to the number of possible outcomes after a period  
has elapsed. 
• 
Given only two possible outcomes, we can match the payoffs 
on the option exactly. That’s because we have two levers (the 
underlying and the risk-free bond) that we can pull to match the two  
possible outcomes. 
• 
However, there are many more than just two possible outcomes for 
the underlying value, especially for options that are on very volatile 
assets, that expire many periods in the future. So, isn’t this method 
very limited? The answer is no, because we are going to imbed this 
simple model in a multi-period model that will make what appears 
to be ridiculous very reasonable. 
• 
At any point in time, the price will change over the next period by 
only one of two factors: one for “the price goes up” and the other for 
“the price goes down.” 
Let the “up” factor be 1 
+ u (so, u is the percent 
return if the underlying 
goes up). Let the down 
factor be 1 − d (so, d is 
the percent return). 
• 
For example, if u = 0.10 
and d = 0.20 and the 
current price is $100, 
then over the next period—for example, 1 year—the price will be 
either $100(1 + 0.1) = $110 or $100(1 − 0.20) = $80.
• 
Let’s say that the likelihood of up (denoted Pu ) and down (denoted 
Pd ) is such that a person investing in the underlying will get a 
positive return—or else they would not invest in the first place. For 

179
example, if Pu = 0.80 and Pd = 0.20, then the expected future value 
of the underlying is 0.80(110) + 0.20(80) = $104. Thus, if we buy 
at the current price of $100, the expected, or average, return over a 
year will be 4%. 
• 
If the probability of up is 0.8 each day, then the likelihood of being 
at the top is 0.8252 = 3.8−25 (252 is the number of trading days the 
market is open). Similarly, the probability of the bottom-most down 
is 0.2252 = 7.23−177. This is much smaller because the probability of 
up is greater than the probability of down. 
• 
When we replicate the payoff of the option, if the replicating 
portfolio and the option generate the same payoffs, then they must 
have the same price. 
The Black–Scholes Model
• 
There is an alternative (but equivalent) way to price the option: 
risk-neutral valuation. The Black–Scholes formula is also based on 
risk-neutral valuation. 
• 
The risk-neutral valuation argument is as follows: Risk and risk 
aversion have nothing to do with the pricing of the option. That’s 
because there is no risk—in the option. We could replicate its 
payoff exactly. Thus, the option is a redundant security. Thus, the 
option is priced according to a “lack of arbitrage.” That is, the 
price of the option must be the same as the cost of the replicating 
portfolio. If there is any risk in the economy, it will be in the price 
of the underlying. 
• 
If we can find probabilities that explain the prices of the securities 
used to replicate the option, then we can just use those probabilities 
to price the option. These probabilities don’t have to be actual 
probability. They can be “pseudo” probabilities that explain the 
price of the underlying under risk neutrality. All the probabilities 
have to do is consistently price one set of securities relative to one 
another. Risk-neutral valuation prices the option as the expected 
value of the final payoffs, using risk-neutral probabilities.

180
Lecture 23: Pricing Derivatives
• 
We will follow a series of steps.
1. 
Pretend that investors are risk neutral. 
 
2. 
Calculate the probabilities of up and down (Pu and Pd) that 
would make a risk-neutral investor indifferent between holding 
the stock and investing in the risk-free bond. 
 
3. 
Using these “risk-neutral” probabilities, calculate the expected 
payoff on the option.
 
4. 
Discount the expected payoff to the current period.
• 
The price of an option is the expected value of its payoffs using 
risk-neutral probabilities inferred from the prices of the underlying 
security. The prices that result rely on the option being redundant. 
That is, they rely on someone being able to replicate the payoff on 
an option using a strategy that uses the underlying and risk-free 
borrowing and lending. 
• 
In a multi-period setup, the replicating strategy is more complicated. 
What a replicator has to do is pick a portfolio of the underlying 
and risk-free bond that will replicate the value of the option over 
the next period. If it does, then the replicator can afford to buy a 
portfolio that replicates the prices of the option over the next 
period—and so on, until the end. Thus, in a multi-period setting, the 
replication strategy is a dynamic trade strategy.
• 
The Black–Scholes formula is based on two assumptions 
related to the dynamic strategy: that prices move continuously 
(this is the binomial with the interval size dropped to infinitely 
small) and that the replicator can continuously trade to form the  
replicating portfolio. 
• 
Clearly, this is not a world with transactions costs. If it were, then 
the replicating portfolio would not work well. The costs would 
eat up its value. Thus, the Black–Scholes, like the binomial, is an 
approximation. It is the most popular option pricing formula, though. 

181
• 
The Black–Scholes formula revolutionized modern finance. While 
there were antecedents by others, the Black–Scholes formula took 
pricing options to the mainstream, which led to the explosion in the 
use of options in all facets of the financial market.
• 
The formula looks quite complex, but it is fairly straightforward 
to use. Prior to their formula, people used something very similar. 
The advance of the Black–Scholes formula was to provide a solid 
theoretical foundation upon which it is based.
• 
Like the binomial method, the formula is based on risk-neutral 
valuation. That is, the value of the option is the present value of the 
expected payoffs on the option under the set of pseudo-risk-neutral 
probabilities. 
• 
There are many places on the web where you can get a  
Black–Scholes calculator.

N(x) is the probability that a normally distributed variable with 
a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 is less than x. To 
calculate it, you can use an Excel spreadsheet function. Specifically, 
use +NORMSDIST(put your number here).

You can think of the formula as follows: call price = present value 
of the expected payoff conditional on the call being in the money 
minus present value of the strike price times the probability of the

1.	 All but one of the characteristics of the option and the securities that 
affect the price of an option are public information (e.g., the current 
market price of the underlying security, the risk-free rate, the strike 
price, and the expiration date). The volatility of the underlying, 
however, is not observable. Rather, investors must estimate volatility 
on their own. Implied volatility is the value of volatility that generates 
the current market price using a particular option pricing formula (e.g., 
Black–Scholes). If the price of a call option increases, will its implied 
volatility rise or fall? What about for a put? 
2.	 The replicating strategies discussed in this lecture will not work well if 
there are relatively high transactions costs. In these cases, an investor 
who wants to hedge against a drop in the value of a security will want to 
buy a put option rather than creating a put-protected position by trading 
according to a replicating strategy. What this means is that put prices 
will likely be higher than those indicated by the replicating portfolio. If 
this is true, then will the implied volatilities on puts and calls be higher 
or lower than the volatilities people really expect?

Lecture 24
T
his lecture begins by discussing whether the capital asset pricing 
model works. It is a beautiful theoretical construct, but it turns 
out that it doesn’t work very well. Therefore, you will learn about 
alternatives to CAPM that are based on the intuition that CAPM provides. 
You will also learn about a few anomalies—systematic phenomena that 
have been documented empirically that are at odds with the models. These 
phenomena might give you some good ideas on where to look for profitable 
excess returns. 
Does CAPM Work?
• 
CAPM has three main implications. 
o	 Everyone should hold the market portfolio.
 
o	 Because everyone holds the market portfolio, the risk of an 
individual security is measured solely by its market beta. Think 
of the beta as the number of units of risk the security has. 
 
o	 Because beta is the sole measure of the risk, the average return 
of an asset should exceed the risk-free rate by the number of 
units of risk that security has (i.e., its beta) times the market 
price of risk (which is the average return on the market in 
excess of the risk-free rate). 
• 
If we apply these three implications to the data, what do they imply 
that we should see? Consider a scatter plot of the returns on a 
security against its beta. If we were to fit a regression line through 
this scatter plot, then we would get an intercept on the vertical 
axis where the beta equals zero. We would also get a slope to the 
relationship. This slope would indicate how much the returns go up 
on average for an increase in the betas in the sample. 

184
Lecture 24: Trade Opportunities or Risk?
• 
CAPM implies that with 
this empirical plot, the 
regression line should 
be such that the intercept 
is the risk-free rate on 
average and that the 
slope is the market risk 
premium (the average 
return on the market in 
excess of the risk-free 
rate). That is, the scatter 
plot should be consistent 
with the CAPM equation 
for expected return. 
• 
What do we get when 
we do this? First, the 
intercept is too high—it’s 
well above the average 
risk-free rate. Second, 
the slope is too flat—it’s 
less than the market risk premium. Third, the fit is terrible. There is 
so much variation in average returns that is not explained by beta. 
The conclusion is that beta is no good. CAPM is no good. 
• 
There are two possible explanations.
o	 The market is not efficient. CAPM is right; the market is wrong. 
This means that you should be able to make money by trading 
on deviations from CAPM—but only if CAPM eventually 
holds, only if these “out of equilibrium” prices move toward 
their equilibrium values. 
 
o	 CAPM is wrong, and the market is right. These average returns 
are correct, but beta is not a good measure of risk. Investors 
know what risk is, and they know it is not beta. So, if you 
trade based on deviations from CAPM, all you will be doing is 
getting extra return because you are bearing more risk. 

185
• 
So, which is more likely? It doesn’t seem that people are getting rich 
trading on violations of CAPM. We know that even professional 
fund managers do not beat their benchmarks on average. So, let’s 
consider that CAPM is wrong. 
Alternatives to CAPM
• 
How can CAPM be wrong? First, it assumes that everyone should 
hold the market portfolio. While we should all be diversified and 
hold broad-based funds, it is clear that only a small percentage of 
the world actually does that. 
• 
Let’s look more closely at the CAPM notion of risk. The reason that 
market beta is risk is because everyone holds the market portfolio 
in the CAPM model. The key intuition is that if everyone holds 
the market and only the market, then the only variation in people’s 
wealth comes from variation in the return on that market portfolio. 
As a result, the risk of an individual security is the covariance of 
that security’s return to the market return (where the market return 
is the only thing all people care about). 
• 
This is a good idea. The idea is that risk is correlation or covariance 
with something you care about. Something is risky if something 
bad happens to it at the same time that something bad happens to 
the thing that you care about. The reason this is risk is because 
you cannot buy that thing to soften the blow of something bad 
happening to the thing you care about. With securities, if a security 
return is down when the market is down, it’s letting you down when 
you need it most. That’s risk. 
• 
This idea leads to alternatives to CAPM. These alternatives are 
called multi-factor models. The idea of a multi-factor model is that 
we should find some other factors that create risk in people’s lives. 
Then, a security would be risky if its return is correlated with that 
factor. In fact, if there are many factors, then a single security might 
be correlated with more than one. Thus, an individual security may 
have multiple risks in it. 

186
Lecture 24: Trade Opportunities or Risk?
• 
The most popular alternative to the CAPM is the Fama–French 
three-factor model augmented with the momentum factor. This 
model uses four portfolios to capture the important risks investors 
face. The portfolios are as follows. 
o	 The market.
 
o	 HML: This is a portfolio formed by sorting firms according 
to their book-to-market ratios. The book value of a company 
is based on accounting and is supposed to measure the 
replacement cost of the firm. The “market” is the market value 
of the firm as priced in the market. So, a high book-to-market 
firm is one with a small market price relative to its replacement 
cost. This is a firm with few growth opportunities. A low book-
to-market firm is one with a high market value relative to its 
replacement cost. The “H” in “HML” stands for “high” book 
to market; the “L” in “HML” stands for “low” book to market. 
The portfolio is a long position in high book-to-market firms 
and an offsetting short position in low book-to-market firms. 
(The “M” in “HML” stands for “minus”.) 
 
o	 SMB: This is a portfolio that is long small firms (for “S”) and 
short big firms (for “B”). 
 
o	 MOM: This is the momentum portfolio that is long past 
winners and short past losers. 
• 
As it turns out, this model does really well. It explains a significant 
amount of the variation on average returns. Again, the idea is that 
each of these portfolios contains some risks that are important  
to investors. 
Anomalies
• 
There is a debate in finance and investments concerning whether 
models like Fama–French (with MOM) are really capturing  
hard-to-identify risks or whether there are identifying excessive 
profit opportunities. 

187
• 
The debate continues—and likely will always continue. As with any 
debate, it is not going to be easy to decide the truth. If it were easy, 
we would have decided on an answer already and we wouldn’t still 
be debating. 
• 
There are a few other phenomena that have been documented in the 
investment literature that are not explained by any models (so far). 
First, idiosyncratic volatility is related to average returns. CAPM 
says that idiosyncratic volatility is not risk. Thus, an investor 
should not get any extra expected return for holding a security that 
has more idiosyncratic volatility than others. 
• 
However, empirically, when you form portfolios on securities that 
have high idiosyncratic volatility, you get average returns that are 
too low relative to our models (including the Fama–French MOM 
four-factor model). 
• 
If this is mispricing, then you might want to short a portfolio of high 
idiosyncratic volatility stocks. Alternatively, it might just be that 
high idiosyncratic volatility stocks have less of some hard-to-find 
risk. As a result, they will have lower average returns to reflect that.
• 
A second phenomenon is that skewness is related to average returns. 
Similarly, stocks that have lottery-like payoffs (which have a small 
probability of paying off big but a big probability of losing a little) 
also tend to have average returns that are too small. 
• 
Penny stocks are like this. The fact that such stocks have lower 
returns than they should (on the basis of CAPM and the Fama–
French three- and four-factor models) indicates that their prices are 
too high. 
• 
Stocks other than penny stocks can also have lottery-like payoffs. 
In fact, it has been shown that, on average, after a stock has 
had a big jump in the past month, the average return is too low  
going forward. 

188
Lecture 24: Trade Opportunities or Risk?
• 
It appears as if people see a jump and think another one is possible. 
Given that, they buy the stock and bid up its price too high. When it 
returns to its efficient level, it generates a low return.

1.	 Do you think that the returns associated with the momentum portfolio 
are due to mispricing or due to that portfolio having an additional hard-
to-identify risk not captured by other risk factors? 
2.	 According to the intuition of CAPM, securities that have returns that 
are positively correlated with your wealth are riskier than those that are 
uncorrelated or negatively correlated. A part of your overall portfolio

to get returns by supplying your labor. Thus, if you work in an industry 
that prospers or languishes with the market, then you have a greater 
exposure to market risk than many other investors. How might you alter 
your portfolio of traded securities to reduce this extra exposure? Is it 
easier to alter your security portfolio or your human capital?

Glossary
abnormal return: A return that is larger than the fair return an investor 
should get given the risk the investor bears; the amount by which a security’s 
average return deviates from the expected return implied by an asset  
pricing model. 
active management: The practice of engaging in analysis designed to 
identify mispriced securities and then adopting investment strategies in 
which securities are actively traded in order to outperform the market. 
alpha: See Jensen’s alpha. 
American option: An option contract that allows the holder to exercise the 
option on or before the expiration date of the option. 
annuity: A security that pays a fixed payment every period (e.g., every six 
months) for a prespecified number of future periods. 
arbitrage opportunity: An arbitrage opportunity exists when two securities 
or portfolios have identical characteristics (in terms of payoffs as a function 
of the state of the economy) but have different values in the market. With such 
a situation, an investor can make an abnormal return without bearing any 
risk; arbitrage is often referred to as a “free lunch.” The arbitrage opportunity 
is exploited by taking a short position in the security with the high value and 
using the proceeds to purchase the security with the low value. 
arbitrage pricing theory (APT): An asset pricing model in which there are 
multiple factors that generate risk. Each individual risk has a risk premium, 
which is the average amount an investor can expect to receive in excess 
of the risk-free rate for bearing one unit of that risk; the size of the risk 
premium for a particular risk is the same across all securities. However, each 
individual security has a set of factor loadings, one loading for each risk; 
the factor loading for a particular risk for an individual security measures 
the number of units of that risk possessed by that individual security. The 

191
product of the factor loading for a particular risk for that individual security 
and the factor risk premium for that risk is the premium—or extra return—
on that security in excess of the risk-free rate to compensate the investor for 
bearing the amount of that type of risk in that security. Thus, under APT, the 
expected return of an individual security exceeds the risk-free rate by the 
sum of the premiums for that security for each of the types of risk. 
asset-liability management: A set of techniques designed to manage the 
variability of a firm’s equity value due to changes in the market values of the 
assets owned by the firm and the liabilities issued by the firm. 
asset pricing model: A theoretical model that implies a specific relationship 
between the characteristics of a security’s returns and that security’s  
expected return.
autocorrelation: The correlation between the value of a variable in one 
period and the value of that variable during a prior period. That is, it is 
the correlation of the variable with itself, but at different points in time. 
Autocorrelation is typically used to quantify if there is a predictable pattern 
in returns over time. If the autocorrelation of the return on a security is 
positive (negative), then the return on that security will more likely than not 
be positive (negative) the next trading day after a positive (negative) return. 
balance sheet risk: The risk of changes in the value of equity associated 
with revisions in the values of assets and/or liabilities on the firm’s  
balance sheet. 
basis point: One one-hundredth of a percentage point; 100 basis points 
equals one percentage point. 
binomial model: An option pricing model that prices the option based on a 
no-arbitrage argument. The model determines the price of the option as the 
value of a replicating trade strategy that uses risk-free borrowing/lending and 
the underlying security of the option to replicate the payoff on the option. 
The model assumes that, at any point in time, the price of the underlying 
security in the next period can only go up by a fixed “up” percentage or 
down by a fixed “down” percentage.

Glossary
Black–Scholes option pricing model: A model for pricing options based 
on a no-arbitrage argument. The model determines the price of the option 
as the value of a replicating trade strategy that uses risk-free borrowing/
lending and the underlying security of the option to replicate the payoff on 
the option. The model assumes continuous trading and that the underlying 
security value also evolves continuously over time. 
budget constraint: The set of consumption bundles that can be consumed 
with a given level of income or wealth. 
call option: A financial contract that gives the holder of the option the 
right to buy an underlying security for the strike (or exercise) price on a 
prespecified date (or set of dates). 
capital asset pricing model (CAPM): An asset pricing models that states 
that the expected return on an individual security should exceed the risk-
free rate by the product of the security’s market beta (the measure of risk 
in CAPM) and the market risk premium. Variation in expected returns 
across different securities is due solely to variation in the market betas of  
the securities. 
compounding: The practice of charging interest on interest not paid in  
the past. 
consumption bundle: A specification of the number of units of the complete 
set of goods and/or services a person might consume; a specific consumption 
bundle corresponds to a specific set of quantities for the goods and/or 
services available. 
correlation or correlation coefficient: Correlation is a unit-less measure 
(ranging from −1 to 1) that translates covariance into a measure of the 
direction and the strength of the relationship between two variables. The 
correlation between two variables is defined as the covariance between the 
two variables divided by the product of the standard deviations of the two 
variables. The sign of the correlation coefficient indicates whether the two 
variables typically move in the same direction (positive correlation) or in 

193
the opposite direction (negative correlation). If the correlation is zero, there 
is no relationship between the movements of the two variables. As the 
correlation rises above zero, the strength of the positive relationship goes 
from none (at zero) to weak (e.g., at 0.2 or 0.3), to fair (e.g., at 0.6), all the 
way up to perfect (at 1). If the correlation is 1, then the deviation of one of 
the variables from its expected value is always (i.e., in all possible random 
outcomes) a constant multiple of the deviation of the other variable from 
its expected value. Thus, when the correlation is 1, the two variables move 
perfectly together. Similarly, as the correlation falls from zero, the negative 
relationship goes from none (at zero) to weak (e.g., at −0.1 or −0.2), to fair 
(e.g., at −0.5), to strong (e.g., at −0.8) to perfect (at −1). 
cost of capital: The amount of return investors demand in order to invest in 
the securities of the firm. This is the cost the firm pays in order to finance the 
purchase of the firm’s capital assets. 
coupon rate: The percentage of a bond’s face value that is paid as an annual 
coupon. Most bonds pay this total coupon in two equal installments (one 
every six months). Thus, the semiannual coupon payment is the product of 
half the coupon rate and the face value of the bond. 
covariance: A measure of the degree to which two variables move in similar 
or opposite directions relative to their expected values. Each variable has a 
set of possible deviations from its expected value. Consider the product of 
the deviation of one variable from its expected value and the deviation of the 
other variable from its expected value. The covariance is the expected value 
of all of these possible paired deviation products. A positive covariance 
implies that, probabilistically, when one of the variables is above (below) 
its expected value, then more often than not the other variable will also 
be above (below) its expected value. A negative covariance implies that, 
probabilistically, when one of the variables is above (below) its expected 
value, then more often than not the other variable will be below (above) its 
expected value. If the covariance is zero, then if one of the variables is above 
(below) its expected value, then it is equally likely that the other variable 
will be above its expected value as below its expected value. For returns, the 
covariance between the returns on two securities is in percent squared.

Glossary
credit default swap: A swap contract that allows a person to swap a bond 
that has experienced a credit event (e.g., a default, a downgrade in credit 
rating) for a prespecified payment (typically the face value of the bond). A 
credit default swap essentially provides insurance against a credit event. 
credit rating: A rating assigned to a fixed-income security by a rating agency 
that gives a general indication of the likelihood that those who invested in 
that security will receive all of the payments promised by the issuing firm. 
credit risk: Default risk. 
data-generating process (DGP): A statistical description of how observed 
data is generated. 
default intensity: See hazard rate. 
default risk: The risk that a firm that issues a fixed-income security will not 
make all of the promised payments. 
default spread: The difference in the yield to maturity on a bond that has 
default risk and the yield to maturity on an equivalent bond (in terms of 
payment size and timing) without any default risk. 
derivative security: A security that derives its value from the values of other 
securities or commodities. Such a security specifies its cash flow or payoff 
as a function of the value of some other security (or set of securities) under 
prespecified conditions (e.g., a price on a specific date). Options and futures 
are examples of derivative securities.
discount rate: The rate r such that the present value of a future cash flow 
equals the value the market is willing to pay in the current period to receive 
that future cash flow; the interest rate charged to depository institutions 
(e.g., banks and savings and loans) by a central bank to borrow at its  
discount window.

195
duration: A measure of interest rate risk for either an individual fixed-
income security or a portfolio of fixed-income securities. The duration is the 
elasticity of the value of the security/portfolio with respect to a change in the 
yield to maturity. 
duration mismatch: There exists a duration mismatch when the durations 
of a firm’s assets and liabilities are different; a duration mismatch creates 
balance sheet risk. 
duration gap: The difference in the duration of a firm’s assets and liabilities. 
effective annual rate: The annualized effective cost of borrowing, given 
the number of times per year interest is compounded. For example, if the 
monthly rate is 1% and the rate is compounded monthly, then a person who 
borrows money for 1 month would be paying an effective annual rate of 
(1.01)12 − 1 = 0.126825 (or 12.6825%) per annum over that month. 
efficient market hypothesis (EMH): A hypothesis that stipulates that 
the market prices of securities accurately and quickly reflect available 
information regarding the future value of the securities or the cash flows 
from the securities. There are three forms, which vary in terms of the types 
of information that are reflected in prices. See weak form, semi-strong 
form, and strong form market efficiency. 
elasticity: A measure of how sensitive the value of a given variable is to 
changes in other variables thought to influence that variable. Specifically, the 
elasticity of variable X with respect to variable Y is defined as the percentage 
change in quantity of variable X that results, given a percentage change in 
the quantity of variable Y. 
equally weighted portfolio: A portfolio formed by holding equal dollar 
amounts in each security included in a set of securities. 
equilibrium: A condition in positive analysis in which the posited system is 
at rest, whereby there are no forces internal to the posited system that might 
cause some variable or variables to change. 

196
Glossary
equity: A claim to the residual cash flows of a firm that remain after the firm 
satisfies all of its payment obligations (including payments of interest and 
principle to the debt holders of the firm). Shares of stock are equity claims. 
European option: An option contract that allows the holder to exercise the 
option only on the expiration date of the option. 
exercise price: The price at which the holder of an option has the right  
to transact.
expectations hypothesis: The hypothesis that the forward rates calculated 
from a yield curve are equal to the market’s expectation of future short-term 
spot rates. 
expected return: The weighted average of the possible returns that may 
occur in the future, with weights equal to the probability of each possible 
outcome. An expected return can be thought of as the average return that 
would occur with a large number of repeated samplings. 
expected utility hypothesis: The hypothesis maintained by most asset 
pricing models that an individual’s preferences over different frequency 
distributions of wealth (resulting from different investment strategies) can be 
ordered (most preferred to least preferred) according to the expected value of 
a set of suitably chosen utility values associated with each possible random 
wealth outcome. The hypothesis states that there exists a set of values for a 
person’s indirect utility of wealth (one value for each possible random wealth 
outcome) that can represent a person’s ranking over lotteries according to the 
expected value of the indirect utility values, where the probabilities used in 
the expected value correspond to the probabilities associated with the wealth 
outcomes under that lottery. 
expiration date: The date after which the holder of an option contract cannot 
exercise the option. 
face value: A fixed amount due at maturity on a bond. The face value is often 
thought of as the principle on a loan (i.e., the amount initially borrowed) 
that must be paid back at the end of the loan. In addition to this principle 

197
amount, borrowers have to make coupon payments on a bond; such coupon 
payments can be thought of as the interest that is paid beyond the principle 
to compensate the lender for making the loan. For zero coupon bonds, the 
face value on the bond represents both the initial amount borrowed and the 
interest (accumulated into the single final payment). 
factor model: A statistical model that decomposes the return of an individual 
security in excess of the risk-free rate into three categories: a fixed or 
constant component, components due to variation in one or a set of common 
factors that (to varying degrees) affect all securities, and a component that 
is purely idiosyncratic to the security. For a specific individual security, the 
component due to variation in a specific common factor equals a coefficient 
that is specific to that individual security times the return on a portfolio that 
captures that common factor. 
fixed-income security: Any security in which the issuer commits to make 
prespecified payments in the future (that is, future payments that are fixed). 
For example, a bond is a fixed-income security; the issuer is contractually 
obligated to make a series of coupon payments of a prespecified size at 
prespecified periods and a final payment of principle at maturity. A stock is 
not a fixed-income security because the issuing firm has discretion regarding 
the size and timing of dividend payments to the holder of the stock. 
forward rate: A rate that specifies a breakeven interest rate for future short-
term bond investments that would make an investor indifferent between 
making a series of short-term bond investments versus investing in a longer-
term bond. For example, consider an investor who can either invest in a 
one-year bond and, at maturity on that bond, invest in a one-year bond next 
year or invest in a two-year bond. The forward rate is the rate for the one-
year bond next year that would make the investor indifferent between these  
two strategies. 
frequency distribution: A mathematical description of the probability 
associated with each possible value of a random variable. All the probabilities 
must sum to 1 because the frequency distribution provides a probability for 
every possible value of the random variable. 

198
Glossary
fundamental value: The value of a security based solely on its future cash 
flows and risk. 
futures: A derivative security in which two parties agree to a future 
transaction price on an underlying security or commodity. 
hazard rate: The probability of a default in a given year after issue, given 
that a default on that bond has not occurred up to that point in time. 
holding period yield: The discount rate that, when used to discount the 
stream of payments an investor receives during the time in which that 
investor held (i.e., owned) the security (including the price received for the 
security when sold), results in a present value equal to the value the investor 
initially paid for the security. The holding period yield is the internal rate of 
return (IRR), given the cash flows received from a security during the period 
in which that security was held (i.e., during the “holding period”). 
human capital: The value of the personal skills, knowledge, and attributes 
that allows a person to generate future cash flows by supplying that  
person’s labor. 
idiosyncratic volatility: The variation in returns on an individual security 
of a firm that is due solely to changing conditions that affect only that firm. 
This volatility contrasts with systematic volatility that results from changes 
in common factors that affect (to varying degrees) all firms. 
incremental: A generic term indicating the extra amount of one variable 
given an increase in some other variable that affects the first variable. 
indirect utility of wealth function: Given a person’s utility function defined 
on consumption bundles, the indirect utility of wealth function specifies the 
maximal level of utility a person can achieve as a function of wealth (i.e., the 
utility associated with the best consumption bundle that is affordable given 
that wealth level). 

199
information ratio: The ratio of Jensen’s alpha to the idiosyncratic volatility 
of a security or portfolio. 
interest rate: The extra amount paid on a loan in excess of the initial amount 
borrowed as a percentage of the amount borrowed. Interest rates are typically 
quoted as the extra amount owed per year. 
interest rate risk: The risk that changes in interest rates cause the return 
received by an investor to vary randomly. 
internal rate of return (IRR): The internal rate of return is the single 
discount rate that, when applied to the projected future cash flows on an 
investment, makes the present value of these cash flows equal to the initial 
cost of the investment. 
inverted yield curve: A yield curve that is downward sloping (i.e., the yields 
to maturity are lower for longer times to maturity). 
Jensen’s alpha: The difference between the expected return on a security 
and the return that is implied by an asset pricing model (typically CAPM). 
Keynes’s “animal spirits”: A phrase used by John Maynard Keynes to 
describe how he thought investors behaved in stock markets. Keynes stated 
that investors’ animal spirits—rather than unemotional deliberate thought—
created changes in stock values. 
Keynes’s beauty contest: A fictitious game defined by John Maynard 
Keynes to describe stock markets. In the game, contestants are asked to 
identify (out of a set of photographs of people) who they think is the most 
beautiful. However, contestants only have a chance of winning if they pick 
the photograph that the other contestants picked most frequently. Thus, rather 
than picking the photograph of the person the contestant actually thinks is 
most beautiful, the contestant may pick the photograph of the person who 
that contestant thinks the most other people will pick as the photograph that 
the most others will pick. 

200
Glossary
lattice: The set of all possible paths the underlying security can take over 
multiple periods in a binomial option pricing model. 
leverage: Using borrowed money to make investments. 
leverage-adjusted duration gap: The difference between the duration of a 
firm’s assets and the product of the duration of the firm’s liabilities and the 
ratio of its liability value to total firm value. If the leverage-adjusted duration 
gap is zero, then the value of equity for the firm is insensitive to changes in 
interest rate (or shifts in yield curves). 
liabilities: Any promise to make a future payment that the firm sells in order 
to raise money for its activities. For example, a bond sold by a firm is a 
liability; an insurance policy that promises to make a specific payment when 
a specific event (e.g., the death of a prespecified person) occurs for which the 
insurance company receives a premium payment is also a liability. 
liquidity: How quickly and cheaply a security can be exchanged for cash. A 
security is liquid if it can be sold quickly without having to lower the price. 
A less liquid security is one in which you either have to wait to find a buyer 
at a high price or you have to lower the price in order to induce someone to 
buy quickly. 
long or long position: An investor is long or has a long position in a specific 
security if he or she owns that security. 
lottery: Any situation in which the future value of wealth for an investor is 
random. The lottery is characterized by the set of possible wealth values and 
the probabilities associated with each. That is, a lottery is characterized by 
the frequency distribution over possible wealth values. 
marginal: See incremental. 
marginal utility of wealth: The extra amount of utility achieved given an 
increase in wealth. Mathematically, it is the derivative of the indirect utility 
of wealth function with respect to wealth. 

201
market beta: A measure of risk for an individual security under the capital 
asset pricing model (CAPM). The market beta of an individual security is the 
ratio of the covariance of the return on the individual security and the return 
on the market portfolio to the variance of the return on the market portfolio. 
market capitalization: The value of the outstanding shares of equity for a 
firm; equal to the price per share times the number of shares. 
market clearing: A condition in a market whereby the price is such that the 
quantity supplied at that price equals the quantity demanded at that price. 
market model: A single-factor model in which the single factor is the return 
on the market portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate. 
market portfolio: The return on a value-weighted portfolio of all the traded 
securities in the market.
market price of risk: The return per unit of risk (as measured by the market 
beta) that investors in an economy receive. 
momentum: A market is said to have momentum if a portfolio that is long 
past “winners” and short past “losers” generates a positive return on average, 
where “winners” are defined as securities that had relatively high returns (for 
example, in the top 10% of returns) and “losers” are defined as securities that 
had relatively low returns (for example, in the bottom 10% of returns). 
mortality rate: The probability that a default on a bond will occur within a 
number of years since that bond’s initial issue. 
multi-factor model: A factor model in which there are multiple common 
factors. The arbitrage pricing theory is based on multi-factor models. An 
example of a multi-factor model is the Fama–French three-factor model, 
where the factors are the return in the market portfolio in excess of the risk-
free rate, the return on a portfolio that is long high book-to-market firms and 
short low book-to-market firms (i.e., the so-called HML portfolio), and the 
return on a portfolio that is long small firms and short big firms (i.e., the so-
called SMB portfolio). 

202
Glossary
net present value: The difference between the present value of the future 
cash flows of an investment or project and the cost required in the present 
period to fund that investment/project. The net present value is the present 
value of the value added from making that investment. 
normative analysis: A type of analysis in which the results are intended to 
provide advice on how to optimally achieve a given goal or objective.
opportunity cost of capital: A measure of the cost associated with making 
an investment in a specific security or project rather than investing in 
available alternative securities or projects. The opportunity cost of capital is 
the return an investor (an individual or a firm) could obtain by investing in 
securities with characteristics (e.g., in terms of risk and liquidity) similar to 
those of the specific security or project being considered. 
option: A financial contract between two parties in which one of the parties 
(the holder, or the owner of the option) has the right to do something specified 
by the contract. The holder has the option in the sense that the holder is not 
obligated to carry out the terms of the contract. Rather, if the holder does 
not want to do what is allowed by the contract, the holder can simply let 
the contract expire unexercised. The other party to the contract (the seller, 
or the writer of the contract), however, is obligated to honor the wishes of  
the holder. 
passive management: The practice of adopting passive investment policies 
that entail holding well-diversified portfolios of securities that are not 
intended to outperform the market. 
periodic rate: The effective rate for a period of a given length. If the periodic 
rate is 0.01 and the period is 1 month, then the monthly periodic rate is 0.01 
(1%) and the 2-month periodic rate is (1.01)2 − 1 = 0.0201 (2.01%). 
perpetuity: A security that pays a fixed payment at even intervals into the 
infinite future. 

203
positive analysis: A type of analysis in which a set of relationships between 
variables is posited and the implications of these posited relationships with 
respect to other variables of interest are derived. 
present value: The equivalent value in the current (or present) period of a 
value or payment to be received in the future. If a person can earn an interest 
rate of r per period between the current and the future period, the present 
value (PV) of a future value (FV) t periods in the future is PV = FV/(1 + r)t. 
present value of growth opportunities: The present value of the stream 
of net present values associated with a firm’s management making good 
investment decisions in the future. 
price risk: The risk that when an investor sells a bond prior to maturity, the 
yields in the market at the time the bond is sold are such that the investor 
does not receive the bond’s initial yield to maturity. 
probability density function: Frequency distribution. 
portfolio: A collection of securities, including those that can be traded 
quickly (e.g., stocks and bonds) and those that trade infrequently (e.g., 
housing and human capital). A portfolio is defined by both the set of 
securities in the portfolio and the relative amounts of money invested in  
each security. 
put option: A financial contract that gives the holder of the option the right to 
sell an underlying security for the strike (or exercise) price on a prespecified 
date (or set of dates). 
random variable: Any variable for which the outcome is uncertain. 
random walk: A variable is said to follow a random walk if the changes in 
the variable from one period to the next are unpredictable, given the series of 
past changes in the variable. With a random walk, the expected value of the 
variable at the next period is equal to the current value (because the expected 
change in the variable is zero). 

204
Glossary
recovery rate: The fraction of a bond’s face value that is the price of that 
bond when a default has been announced. For example, if after a default is 
announced the bond sells at $800 per $1000 in face value, the recovery rate 
is 0.8 (or 80%). 
reinvestment risk: The risk that interest rates will fall by the time an 
investor needs to make an investment, causing future returns to be smaller 
than expected. 
regression: A statistical method for determining how a variable of 
interest (the dependent variable) varies with a set of other variables (the  
independent variables). 
required rate of return: The minimum return an investor requires on an 
investment before that investor is willing to make that investment. The 
required rate of return is equal to the opportunity cost of capital.
risk aversion: An aversion to random variation in wealth levels. 
risk-free rate: The return on default-free bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury 
securities) that mature at the end of an investor’s short-term  
investment horizon. 
risk neutrality: A person is risk neutral or has risk neutrality if he or she 
is indifferent between random distributions of wealth that have the same 
expected value but different variances. 
risk-neutral probabilities: A set of probabilities that is consistent with a 
set of security prices under the assumption that the equilibrium is that which 
occurs when all market participants are risk neutral. 
semi-strong-form market efficiency: A form of the efficient market 
hypothesis that stipulates that any information from past prices or returns and 
public announcements regarding the economy or the firm that can be used to 
predict the future values or cash flows of securities is reflected in the current 
price of the security. This implies that an investor cannot make excessive 

205
profits from trading based solely on public announcements; excessive profits 
are those in excess of what an investor should earn simply by bearing risk by 
investing. The semi-strong form is stronger (i.e., harder to satisfy) because 
it includes information stipulated to be reflected under the weak form plus 
public information. Also, because the hypotheses are nested, a rejection of 
the weak form is a rejection of the semi-strong form. However, a rejection 
of the semi-strong form (i.e., that some public information is not reflected 
in current prices) is not necessarily a rejection of the weak form (e.g., past 
returns and price information may be fully reflected). 
Sharpe ratio or measure: A measure of the efficacy of a portfolio as the 
single risky portfolio for an investor to hold. It is calculated as the difference 
between the expected return on the portfolio and the risk-free rate divided by 
the standard deviation of the return on that portfolio. Thus, the Sharpe ratio 
for a portfolio is the extra return (in excess of the risk-free rate) per unit of 
risk (as measured by the return standard deviation) for that portfolio. 
short or short position: An investor is short or has a short position in a 
specific security if he or she has borrowed the security and sold it. 
short sale: A short sale is when a security is borrowed and then sold. 
The borrower/seller must return the borrowed security at some point 
in the future. If the price of the security rises, then the borrower must 
buy the security back at a higher price than he or she received when the 
security was sold, producing a loss; alternatively, by borrowing the 
security and selling it short, the borrower is borrowing money, with the 
borrowing cost per dollar borrowed equal to the return on the security 
borrowed. If the price of the security falls, then the borrower will be able 
to buy the security back (to return to the lender) at a lower price, thus 
generating a gain. 
short-term investment horizon: The interval of time in which an investor 
is expected to maintain positions in most of the securities held in that 
investor’s portfolio. At the end of this interval, the investor is likely to 
rebalance or alter the composition of his or her portfolio in response to  
new information. 

206
Glossary
single-factor model: A factor model in which there is only one common 
factor. The market model is an example of a single-factor model; the single 
common factor in the market model is the return on the market portfolio in 
excess of the risk-free rate. 
spot rate: The rate or yield to maturity of a bond traded in the current market 
for delivery now. 
standard deviation: A measure of the variability of a random variable equal 
to the square root of the random variable’s variance. 
stated annual rate: The periodic rate times the number of periods per year. 
For example, if the periodic rate is 0.01 and the period is 1 month, the stated 
annual rate is 12 × 0.01 = 0.12 (or 12%). Note that if interest is compounded 
monthly, then the effective annual rate is (1.01)12 − 1 = 0.126825 (or 
12.6825%), which is greater than the stated rate. Also note that if a person 
were to borrow $1 at a stated rate of 12% compounded monthly, then the 
periodic rate is 0.12/12 = 0.01 and, after borrowing that dollar for a whole 
year, that person would have to pay back (1 + (0.12/12))12 = $1.126825, for 
an effective annual interest cost of $0.126825 (or 12.6825% of the borrow 
dollar), which is the effective annual rate (not the stated rate). 
strike price: See exercise price. 
strong form market efficiency: A form of the efficient market hypothesis 
that stipulates that, in addition to the information stipulated to be reflected 
under the weak and semi-strong forms, any private information also can 
be reflected in current prices. This implies that even a corporate officer 
with inside information cannot make excessive profits by trading on this  
private information. 
swap: A derivative security that specifies conditions under which one party 
can swap one security for another (including cash). 
systematic volatility: The variation in the return on an individual security 
that is due to changing economy-wide conditions that affect all firms (to 
varying degrees). 

207
term structure of interest rates: The relationships between the yields in a 
yield curve. 
Treynor–Black model: A model in which an investor divides his or her 
portfolio into an active portfolio (comprised of securities that the investor 
thinks will generate abnormal returns) and a passive portfolio (consisting of 
a well-diversified portfolio). 
Treynor measure: A measure of the return per unit of risk, where (rather 
than using the standard deviation of the portfolio as in the Sharpe ratio) the 
risk of the portfolio is measured by its market beta. 
underlying security: The security (or commodity) that an option holder has 
the right to buy (for a call) or sell (for a put). 
utility function: A mathematical description of the level of satisfaction a 
person achieves for a given consumption bundle. The numerical value of 
the utility function is said to represent a person’s preferences over possible 
consumption bundles if, for every possible pair of consumption bundles, 
the numerical value of the utility function for the preferred bundle is larger 
than the numerical value of the utility function for the less preferred bundle. 
The utility function will produce equal numerical values when the person is 
indifferent between the two bundles. 
value-weighted portfolio: A portfolio formed by holding a specific set of 
securities in proportion to the value of their market capitalizations.
weighted average cost of capital (WACC): The weighted average of the 
returns on each of the securities issued by a firm to finance its activities. The 
weighted average cost of capital is a measure of the firm’s cost of capital; 
it is the return that an investor would receive if he or she were to hold all 
of the securities sold by a firm (e.g., stocks and bonds) in proportion to the 
securities market value relative to the firm value. 
weak form market efficiency: A form of the efficient market hypothesis 
that stipulates that any information from past prices or returns that can be 
used to predict the future values or cash flows of securities is reflected in 

208
Glossary
the current price of the security. This implies that an investor cannot make 
excessive profits from trading rules based solely on predictable patterns in 
returns or prices; excessive profits are those in excess of what an investor 
should earn simply by bearing risk by investing. 
yield to maturity: A measure of the return from holding a bond until 
maturity. The yield to maturity is the value of the discount rate that, when 
applied to the cash flows from a bond, generate a present value equal to the 
current price of that bond.
yield curve: A plot of the yield to maturity (on the vertical axis) against the 
time to maturity (on the horizontal axis). This plot shows how the yields to 
maturity at a particular point in time vary by time to maturity. 
zero coupon bond: A bond that has a coupon rate of zero; such a bond pays 
no coupons, paying only its face value at maturity. 
variance: A measure of the uncertainty or unpredictability of a variable. 
The variance is the expected value of the squared deviations of the possible 
values of the variable from that variable’s expected value. 
volatility: The standard deviation of the return on a security.
