Creating 
Files & Folders

To create a new file from the command line, use the
touch command.  Provide a filename, and that file will
be created for you (assuming it doesn't already exist)
For example, touch chicken.txt would create a
chicken.txt file in the current directory.  
If you try to use touch with a file that already exists, it
will simply update the access and modification dates to
the current time.  
touch
touch <filename>
❯

The file command can be used to determine the file type of a
specified file.  It's honestly not that important!
For example, running file contract.pdf will tell us the file type
of contract.pdf  
"conctract.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4"
Note, it does not use the file extension to "decide" on the file
type.  We could have a pdf file named app.png
file
file <filename>
❯

To create new directories, we use the make directory
(mkdir) command.  We provide one or more directory
names, and it will create them for us.
For example, to create two new folders, images and
styles, we could run mkdir images styles
mkdir
mkdir <foldername>
