KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 3
This problem set focuses on material covered in Lecture 5, so I recommend you to watch the lecture and
attempt Assignment 5 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing (and submitting)
the problem set is Monday February 24 at 9:00 AM US-PST. Note that you can save your entries as you
work through the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission, but once you submit
your answers no further changes are possible.
1. Let x be a variable ranging over doubles tennis matches, and t be a variable ranging over doubles
tennis matches when Rosario partners with Antonio. Let W(x) mean that Rosario and her partner
(whoever it is) win the doubles match x. Select the following English sentences that mean the same
as the symbolic formula ∃tW(t):
(a) Rosario and Antonio win every match where they are partners.
(b) Rosario and her partner sometimes win the match when she partners with Antonio.
(c) Whenever Rosario plays with Antonio, they win the match.
(d) Rosario and Antonio win exactly one match when they are partners.
(e) Rosario and Antonio win at least one match when they are partners.
(f) If Rosario and her partner win the match, she must be partnering with Antonio.
2. Let x be a variable ranging over doubles tennis matches, and t be a variable ranging over doubles
tennis matches when Rosario partners with Antonio. Let W(x) mean that Rosario and her partner
(whoever it is) win the doubles match x. Select the following English sentences that mean the same
as the symbolic formula ∀tW(t):
(a) Rosario and Antonio win every match where they are partners.
(b) Rosario always partners with Antonio.
(c) Whenever Rosario partners with Antonio, they win the match.
(d) Sometimes, Rosario and her partner win the match.
(e) Rosario and her partner win the match whenever she partners with Antonio.
(f) If Rosario and her partner win the match, she must be partnering with Antonio.
3. Which of the following formal propositions says that there is no largest prime. (There may be more
than one. You have to select all correct propositions.) The variables denote natural numbers.
(a) ¬∃x∃y[Prime(x) ∧¬Prime(y) ∧(x < y)]
(b) ∀x∃y[Prime(x) ∧Prime(y) ∧(x < y)]
(c) ∀x∀y[Prime(x) ∧Prime(y) ∧(x < y)]
(d) ∀x∃y[Prime(y) ∧(x < y)]
(e) ∃x∀y[Prime(y) ∧(x < y)]
(f) ∀x∃y[Prime(x) ∧(x < y)]
4. The symbol ∃!x means “There exists a unique x such that . . . ” Which of the following accurately
deﬁnes the expression ∃!xφ(x)?
(a) ∃x∀y[φ(x) ∧[φ(y) ⇒(x ̸= y)]]
(b) ∃x[φ(x) ∧(∃y)[φ(y) ⇒(x ̸= y)]]
1

(c) ∃x∃y[(φ(x) ∧φ(y)) ⇒(x = y)]
(d) [∃xφ(x)] ∧(∀y)[φ(y) ⇒(x = y)]
(e) ∃x[φ(x) ∧(∀y)[φ(y) ⇒(x = y)]]
5. Which of the following means “The arithmetic operation x↑y is not commutative.” (↑is just some
arbitrary binary operation.)
(a) ∀x∀y[x↑y ̸= y↑x]
(b) ∀x∃y[x↑y ̸= y↑x]
(c) ∃x∃y[x↑y ̸= y↑x]
(d) ∃x∀y[x↑y ̸= y↑x]
6. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
Claim: There does not exist a positive integer N such that N 2 + 4N + 3 is prime.
Proof: N 2 + 4N + 3 = (N + 1)(N + 3). This is not prime.
