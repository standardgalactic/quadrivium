Preface
Preface
Part II in this series of three on convexity and optimization is about linear
and convex optimization.
We start by studying some equivalent ways to formulate a given opti-
mization problem and then present some classical model examples.
Duality is an important principle in many areas of mathematics, so also in
optimization theory. To each minimization problem we can associate a dual
maximization problem by means of the so-called Lagrange function, and the
two problems have the same optimal value provided certain conditions are
fulﬁlled. We devote two chapters to the study of duality for general convex
optimization problems and then treat the special case of linear programming
in a separate chapter.
The simplex algorithm, which until the mid 1980’s was the only practical
algorithm for solving large linear optimization problems, is studied in the
last chapter.

Optimization
Chapter 9
Optimization
The Latin word optimum means ’the best’. The optimal alternative among
a number of diﬀerent alternatives is the one that is the best in some way.
Optimization is therefore, in a broad sense, the art of determining the best.
Optimization problems occur not only in diﬀerent areas of human plan-
ning, but also many phenomena in nature can be explained by simple opti-
mization principles. Examples are light propagation and refraction in diﬀer-
ent media, thermal conductivity and chemical equilibrium.
In everyday optimization problems, it is often diﬃcult, if not impossible,
to compare and evaluate diﬀerent alternatives in a meaningful manner. We
shall leave this diﬃculty aside, for it can not be solved by mathematical
methods. Our starting point is that the alternatives are ranked by means of
a function, for example a proﬁt or cost function, and that the option that
gives the maximum or minimum function value is the best one.
The problems we will address are thus purely mathematical −to min-
imize or maximize given functions over sets that are given by a number of
constraints.
9.1
Optimization problems
Basic notions
We begin by recalling the following notation from Part I:
R = R ∪{+∞}
R = R ∪{−∞}
R = R ∪{−∞, +∞}.

Optimization
For the problem of minimizing a function f : Ω→R over a subset X of
the domain Ωof the function, we use the notation
min f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X.
Here, s.t. is an abbreviation for the phrase subject to the condition.
The elements of the set X are called the feasible points or feasible solutions
of the optimization problem. The function f is the objective function.
Observe that vi allow +∞as a function value of the objective function
in a minimization problem.
The (optimal) value vmin of the minimization problem is by deﬁnition
vmin =

inf {f(x) | x ∈X}
if X ̸= ∅,
+∞
if X = ∅.
The optimal value is thus a real number if the objective function is bounded
below and not identically equal to +∞on the set X, the value is −∞if the
function is not bounded below on X, and the value is +∞if the objective
function is identically equal to +∞on X or if X = ∅.
Of course, we will also study maximization problems, and the problem of
maximizing a function f : Ω→R over X will be written
max f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X.
The (optimal) value vmax of the maximization problem is deﬁned by
vmax =

sup {f(x) | x ∈X}
if X ̸= ∅,
−∞
if X = ∅.
The optimal value of a minimization or maximization problem is in this
way always deﬁned as a real number, −∞or +∞, i.e. as an element of
the extended real line R. If the value is a real number, we say that the
optimization problem has a ﬁnite value.
A feasible point x0 for an optimization problem with objective function
f is called an optimal point or optimal solution if the value of the problem
is ﬁnite and equal to f(x0). An optimal solution of a minimization problem
is, in other words, the same as a global minimum point (with a ﬁnite value).
Of course, problems with ﬁnite optimal values need not necessarily have any
optimal solutions.

From a mathematical point of view, there is no diﬀerence in principle be-
tween maximization problems and minimization problems, since the optimal
values vmax and vmin of the problems
max f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
and
min −f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
,
respectively, are connected by the simple relation vmax = −vmin, and x0 is a
maximum point of f if and only if x0 is a minimum point of −f. For this
reason, we usually only formulate results for minimization problems.
Finally, a comment as to why we allow +∞and −∞as function values
of the objective functions as this seems to complicate matters. The most
important reason is that sometimes we have to consider functions that are
deﬁned as pointwise suprema of an inﬁnite family of functions, and the supre-
mum function may assume inﬁnite values even if all functions in the family
assume only ﬁnite values. The alternative to allowing functions with values
in the extended real line would be to restrict the domain of these supremum
functions, and this is neither simpler nor more elegant.

Optimization
General comments
There are some general and perhaps completely obvious comments that are
relevant for many optimization problems.
Existence of feasible points
This point may seem trivial, for if a problem has no feasible points then there
is not much more to be said. It should however be remembered that the set
of feasible points is seldom given explicitly. Instead it is often deﬁned by a
system of equalities and inequalities, which may not be consistent.
If the problem comes from the ”real world”, simpliﬁcations and defects
in the mathematical model may lead to a mathematical problem that lacks
feasible points.
Existence of optimal solutions
Needless to say, a prerequisite for the determination of the optimal solution
of a problem is that there is one. Many theoretical results are of the form
’If x0 is an optimal solution, then x0 satisﬁes these conditions.’ Although
this usually restricts the number of potential candidates for optimal points,
it does not prove the existence of such points.
From a practical point of view, however, the existence of an optimal so-
lution −and its exact value, if such a solution exists −may not be that
important. In many applications one is often satisﬁed with a feasible solu-
tions that is good enough.
Uniqueness
Is the optimal solution, if such a solution exists, unique?
The answer is
probably of little interest for somebody looking for the solution of a practical
problem −he or she should be satisﬁed by having found a best solution even
if there are other solutions that are just as good. And if he or she would
consider one of the optimal solutions better than the others, then we can only
conclude that the optimization problem is not properly set from the start,
because the objective function apparently does not include everything that
is required to sort out the best solution.
However, uniqueness of an optimal solution may sometimes lead to inter-
esting properties that can be of use when looking for the solution.

Optimization
Dependence on parameters and sensitivity
Sometimes, and in particular in problems that come directly from ”reality”,
objective functions and constraints contain parameters, which are only given
with a certain accuracy and, in the worst case, are more or less coarse esti-
mates. In such cases, it is not suﬃcient to determine the optimal solution,
but it is at least as important to know how the solution changes when pa-
rameters are changed. If a small perturbation of one parameter alters the
optimal solution very much, there is reason to consider the solution with
great skepticism.
Qualitative aspects
Of course, it is only for a small class of optimization problems that one
can specify the optimum solution in exact form, or where the solution can
be described by an algorithm that terminates after ﬁnitely many iterations.
The mathematical solution to an optimization problem often consists of a
number of necessary and/or suﬃcient conditions that the optimal solution
must meet. At best, these can be the basis for useful numerical algorithms,
and in other cases, they can perhaps only be used for qualitative statements
about the optimal solutions, which however in many situations can be just
as interesting.
Algorithms
There is of course no numerical algorithm that solves all optimization prob-
lems, even if we restrict ourselves to problems where the constraint set is
deﬁned by a a ﬁnite number of inequalities and equalities. However, there
are very eﬃcient numerical algorithms for certain subclasses of optimization
problems, and many important applied optimization problems happen to be-
long to these classes. We shall study some algorithms of this type in the last
chapter of this Part II and in Part III.
The development of good algorithms has been just as important as the
computer development for the possibility of solving big optimization prob-
lems, and much of the algorithm development has occurred in recent decades.

we must make various assumptions about the objective function f : Ω→R
and about the set X of feasible points.
We will always assume that Ωis a subset of Rn and that the set X can
be expressed as the solution set of a number of inequalities and equalities,
i.e. that
X = {x ∈Ω| g1(x) ≤0, . . . , gp(x) ≤0, gp+1(x) = 0, . . . , gm(x) = 0}
where g1, g2, . . . , gm are real valued functions deﬁned on Ω.
We do not exclude the possibility that all constraints are equalities, i.e.
that p = 0, or that all constraints are inequalities, i.e. that p = m, or that
there are no constraints at all, i.e. that m = 0.
Since the equality h(x) = 0 can be replaced by the two inequalities
±h(x) ≤0, we could without loss of generality assume that all constraints
are inequalities, but it is convenient to formulate results for optimization
problems with equalities among the constraints without ﬁrst having to make
such rewritings.
If ˆx is a feasible point and gi(ˆx) = 0, we say that the i:th constraint is
active at the point ˆx. All constraints in the form of equalities are, of course,
active at all feasible points.

Optimization
The condition x ∈Ωis (in the case Ω̸= Rn) of course also a kind of
constraint, but it plays a diﬀerent role than the other constraints. We will
sometimes call it the implicit constraint in order to distinguish it from the
other explicit constraints. If Ωis given as the solution set of a number of
inequalities of type hi(x) ≤0 and the functions hi, the objective function
and the explicit constraint functions are deﬁned on the entire space Rn, we
can of course include the inequalities hi(x) ≤0 among the explicit conditions
and omit the implicit constraint.
The domain Ωwill often be clear from the context, and it is in these cases
not mentioned explicitly in the formulation of the optimization problem. The
minimization problem (P) will therefore often be given in the following form
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m.
Linear programming
The problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear form over a polyhedron,
which is given in the form of an intersection of closed halvspaces in Rn,
is called linear programming, abbreviated LP. The problem (P) is, in other
words, an LP problem if the objective function f is linear and X is the set
of solutions to a ﬁnite number of linear equalities and inequalities.
We will study LP problems in detail in Chapter 12.
Convex optimization
The minimization problem
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
with implicit constraint x ∈Ωis called convex, if the set Ωis convex, the
objective function f : Ω→R is convex, and the constraint functions gi are
convex for i = 1, 2, . . . , p and aﬃne for i = p + 1, . . . , m.
The aﬃne conditions gp+1(x) = 0, . . . , gm(x) = 0 in a convex problem
can of course be summarized as Ax = b, where A is an (m −p) × n-matrix.
The set X of feasible points is convex in a convex minimization problem,

and this expresses X as an intersection of sublevel sets of convex functions
and hyperplanes.
A maximization problem
max f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
is called convex if the corresponding equivalent minimization problem
min −f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
is convex, which means that the objective function f has to be concave.
LP problems are of course convex optimization problems. General convex
optimization problems are studied in Chapter 11.
Convex quadratic programming
We get a special case of convex optimization if X is a polyhedron and the
objective function f is a sum of a linear form and a positive semideﬁnite
quadratic form, i.e. has the form f(x) = ⟨c, x⟩+ ⟨x, Qx⟩, where Q is a
positive semideﬁnite matrix. The problem (P) is then called convex quadratic
programming. LP problems constitute a subclass of the convex quadratic
problems, of course.
Non-linear optimization
Non-linear optimization is about optimization problems that are not sup-
posed to be LP problems.
Since non-linear optimization includes almost
everything, there is of course no general theory that can be applied to an
arbitrary non-linear optimization problem.
If f is a diﬀerentiable function and X is a ”decent” set in Rn, one can of
course use diﬀerential calculus to attack the minimization problem (P). We
recall in this context the Lagrange theorem, which gives a necessary condition
for the minimum (and maximum) when
X = {x ∈Rn | g1(x) = g2(x) = · · · = gm(x) = 0}.
A counterpart of Lagrange’s theorem for optimization problems with con-
straints in the form of inequalities is given in Chapter 10.
Integer programming
An integer programming problem is a mathematical optimization problem in
which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers. In particular,

a linear integer problem is a problem of the form
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
x ∈X ∩(Zm × Rn−m)
where ⟨c, x⟩is a linear form and X is a polyhedron in Rn.
Many problems dealing with ﬂows in networks, e.g. commodity distribu-
tion problems and maximum ﬂow problems, are linear integer problems that
can be solved using special algorithms.
Simultaneous optimization
The title refers to a type of problems that are not really optimization prob-
lems in the previous sense. There are many situations, where an individual
may aﬀect the outcome through his actions without having full control over
the situation. Some variables may be in the hands of other individuals with
completely diﬀerent desires about the outcome, while other variables may be
of a completely random nature. The problem to in some sense optimize the
outcome could then be called simultaneous optimization.

Optimization
Simultaneous optimization is the topic of game theory, which deals with
the behavior of the various agents in conﬂict situations. Game theoretical
concepts and results have proved to be very useful in various contexts, e.g.
in economics.
9.3
Equivalent problem formulations
Let us informally call two optimization problems equivalent if it is possible to
determine in an automatical way an optimal solution to one of the problems,
given an optimal solution to the other, and vice versa.
A trivial example of equivalent problems are, as already mentioned, the
problems
max f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
and
min −f(x).
s.t.
x ∈X
We now describe some useful transformations that lead to equivalent op-
timization problem
Elimination of equalities
Consider the problem
(P)
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m.
If it is possible to solve the subsystem of equalities and express the solution
in the form x = h(y) with a parameter y running over some subset of Rd,
then we can eliminate the equalities and rewrite problem (P) as
(P′)
min f(h(y))
s.t.
gi(h(y)) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
If ˆy is an optimal solution to (P′), then h(ˆy) is of course an optimal solution
to (P). Conversely, if ˆx is an optimal solution to (P), then ˆx = h(ˆy) for some
value ˆy of the parameter, and this value is an optimal solution to (P′).
The elimination is always possible (by a simple algorithm) if all constraint
equalities are aﬃne, i.e. if the system can be written in the form Ax = b for
some (m −p) × n-matrix A. Assuming that the system is consistent, the
solution set is an aﬃne subspace of dimension d = n −rank A, and there
exists an n×d-matrix C of rank d and a particular solution x0 to the system

Optimization
such that Ax = b if and only if x = Cy + x0 for some y ∈Rd. The problem
(P) is thus in this case equivalent to the problem
min f(Cy + x0)
s.t.
gi(Cy + x0) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
(with implicit constraint Cy + x0 ∈Ω).
In convex optimization problems, and especially in LP problems, we can
thus, in principle, eliminate the equalities from the constraints and in this
way replace the problem by an equivalent optimization problem without any
equality constraints.
Slack variables
The inequality g(x) ≤0 holds if and only if there is a number s ≥0 such
that g(x) + s = 0. By thus replacing all inequalities in the problem
(P)
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
with equalities, we obtain the following equivalent problem
(P′)
min f(x)
s.t.



gi(x) + si = 0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
si ≥0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
with n + p variables, m equality constraints and p simple inequality con-
straints. The new variables si are called slack variables.
If ˆx is an optimal solution to (P), we get an optimal solution (ˆx, ˆs) to (P′)
by setting ˆsi = −gi(ˆx). Conversely, if (ˆx, ˆs) is an optimal solution to the last
mentioned problem, then ˆx is of course an optimal solution to the original
problem.
If the original constraints are aﬃne, then so are all new constraints. The
transformation thus transforms LP problems to LP problems.
Inequalities of the form g(x) ≥0 can of course similarly be written as
equalities g(x)−s = 0 with nonnegative variables s. These new variables are
usually called surplus variables.

Nonnegative variables
Every real number can be written as a diﬀerence between two nonnegative
numbers. In an optimization problem, we can thus replace an unrestricted
variable xi, i.e. a variable that a priori may assume any real value, with two
nonnegative variables x′
i and x′′
i by setting
xi = x′
i −x′′
i , x′
i ≥0, x′′
i ≥0.
The number of variables increases with one and the number of inequalities
increases with two for each unrestricted variable that is replaced, but the
transformation leads apparently to an equivalent problem. Moreover, convex
problems are transfered to convex problems and LP problems are transformed
to LP problems.

Epigraph form
Every optimization problem can be replaced by an equivalent problem with
a linear objective function, and the trick to accomplish this is to utilize the
epigraph of the original objective function. The two problems
(P)
min f(x)
s.t.
x ∈X
and
(P′)
min t
s.t.
f(x) ≤t
x ∈X
are namely equivalent, and the objective function in (P′) is linear. If ˆx is an
optimal solution to (P), then (ˆx, f(ˆx)) is an optimal solution to (P′), and if
(ˆx, ˆt) is an optimal solution to (P′), then ˆx is an optimal solution to (P).
If problem (P) is convex, i.e. has the form
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
with convex functions f and gi for 1 ≤i ≤p, and aﬃne functions gi for
i ≥p + 1, then the epigraph variant
min t
s.t.



f(x) −t ≤0,
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
is also a convex problem.
So there is no restriction to assume that the objective function of a convex
program is linear when we are looking for general properties of such programs.

Diet problem
Let us start with a classical LP problem that was formulated and studied
during the childhood of linear programming. The goal of the diet problem
is to select a set of foods that will satisfy a set of daily nutritional require-
ments at minimum cost.
There are n foods L1, L2, . . . , Ln available at a
cost of c1, c2, . . . , cn dollars per unit. The foods contain various nutrients
N1, N2, . . . , Nm (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, etc.). The number
of units of nutrients per unit of food is shown by the following table:

units of nutrient Ni at a cost of
c1x1 + c2x2 + · · · + cnxn.
Suppose that the daily requirement of the diﬀerent nutrients is b1, b2,
. . . , bm and that it is not harmful to have too much of any substance. The
problem to meet the daily requirement at the lowest possible cost is called
the diet problem. Mathematically, it is of the form
min c1x1 + c2x2 + · · · + cnxn
s.t.


a21x1 + a22x2 + · · · + a2nxn ≥b2
...
am1x1 + am2x2 + · · · + amnxn ≥bm
x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥0.
The diet problem is thus an LP problem. In addition to determining
the optimal diet and the cost of this, it would be of interest to answer the
following questions:
1. How does a price change of one or more of the foods aﬀect the optimal
diet and the cost?
2. How is the optimal diet aﬀected by a change of the daily requirement
of one or more nutrients?
3. Suppose that pure nutrients are available on the market. At what price
would it be proﬁtable to buy these and satisfy the nutritional needs by
eating them instead of the optimal diet? Hardly a tasty option for a
gourmet but perhaps possible in animal feeding.
Assume that the cost of the optimal diet is z, and that its cost changes
to z + ∆z when the need for nutrient N1 is changed from b1 to b1 + ∆b1,
ceteris paribus. It is obvious that the cost can not be reduced when demand
increases, so therefore ∆b1 > 0 entails ∆z ≥0. If it is possible to buy the
nutrient N1 in completely pure form to the price p1, then it is economically
advantageous to meet the increased need by taking the nutrient in pure form,
provided that p1∆b1 ≤∆z. The maximum price of N1 which makes nutrient
in pure form an economical alternative is therefore ∆z/∆b1, and the limit as
∆b1 →0, i.e. the partial derivative ∂z
∂b1, is called the dual price or the shadow
price in economic literature.
It is possible to calculate the nutrient shadow prices by solving an LP
problem closely related to the diet problem. Assume again that the market
provides nutrients in pure form and that their prices are y1, y2, . . . , ym. Since
one unit of food Li contains a1i, a2i, . . . , am units of each nutrient, we can

”manufacture” one unit of food Li by buying just this set of nutrients, and
hence it is economically advantageous to replace all foods by pure nutrients
if
a1iy1 + a2iy2 + · · · + amym ≤ci
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Under these conditions the cost of the required daily ration
b1, b2, . . . , bm is at most equal to the maximum value of the LP problem

We will show that this so called dual problem has the same optimal value
as the original diet problem and that the optimal solution is given by the
shadow prices.
Production planning
Many problems related to production planning can be formulated as LP
problems, and a pioneer in the ﬁeld was the Russian mathematician and
economist Leonid Kantorovich, who studied and solved such problems in the
late 1930s. Here is a typical such problem.
A factory can manufacture various goods V1, V2, . . . , Vn. This requires
various inputs (raw materials and semi-ﬁnished goods) and diﬀerent types of
labor, something which we collectively call production factors P1, P2, . . . , Pm.
These are available in limited quantities b1, b2, . . . , bm. In order to manufac-
ture, market and sell one unit of the respective goods, production factors are
needed to an extent given by the following table:
V1
V2
. . .
Vn
P1

a12
. . .
a1n
P2
a21
a22
. . .
a2n

Pm
am1
am2
. . .
amn
Every manufactured product Vj can be sold at a proﬁt which is cj dollars per
unit, and the goal now is to plan the production x1, x2, . . . , xn of the various
products so that the proﬁt is maximized.

Manufacturing x1, x2, . . . , xn units of the goods consumes ai1x1 + ai2x2 +
· · · + ainxn units of production factor Pi and results in a proﬁt equal to
c1x1 + c2x2 + · · · + cnxn. The optimization problem that we need to solve is
thus the LP problem

...
am1x1 + am2x2 + . . . + amnxn ≤bm
x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥0.
Here it is reasonable to ask similar questions as for the diet problem, i.e. how
is the optimal solution and the optimal proﬁt aﬀected by
1. altered pricing c1, c2, . . . , cn;
2. changes in the resource allocation.
If we increase a resource Pi that is already fully utilized, so does (nor-
mally) the proﬁt. What will the price of this resource be for the expansion
to pay oﬀ? The critical price is called the shadow price, and it can be inter-
preted as a partial derivative, and as the solution to a dual problem.

Transportation problem
The transportation problem is another classical LP problem that was formu-
lated and solved before the invention of the simplex algorithm
A commodity (e.g. gasoline) is stored at m places S1, S2, . . . , Sm and de-
manded at n other locations D1, D2, . . . , Dn. The quantity of the commodity
available at Si is ai units, while bj units are demanded at Dj. To ship 1 unit
from storage place Si to demand center Dj costs cij dollars.

The return will depend on the projects and the upcoming economic cycle.
He thinks he can identify n diﬀerent economic situations E1, E2, . . . , En, but
it is impossible for him to accurately predict what the economy will look like
in the coming year, after which he intends to collect the return. However,
one can accurately assess the return of each project during the various eco-
nomic cycles; each invested million dollars in project Pi will yield a return

Two-person zero-sum game
Two persons, row player Rick and column player Charlie, each choose, inde-
pendently of each other, an integer. Rick chooses a number i in the range
1 ≤i ≤m and Charlie a number j in the range 1 ≤j ≤n. If they choose
the pair (i, j), Rick wins aij dollars of Charlie, and to win a negative amount
is of course the same as to loose the corresponding positive amount.
The numbers m, n and aij are supposed to be known by both players, and
the objective of each player is to win as much as possible (or equivalently, to
loose as little as possible). There is generally no best choice for any of the
players, but they could try to maximize their expected winnings by selecting
their numbers at random with a certain probability distribution.
Suppose Rick chooses the number i with probability xi, and Charlie
chooses the number j with probability yj. All probabilities are of course
nonnegative numbers, and m

The two players’ problems are examples of dual problems, and it follows

value.
Consumer Theory
The behavior of consumers is studied in a branch of economics known as
microeconomics. Assume that there are n commodities V1, V2, . . . , Vn on
the market and that the price of these goods is given by the price vector
p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn). A basket x consisting of x1, x2, . . . , xn units of the goods
thus costs ⟨p, x⟩= p1x1 + p2x2 + · · · + pnxn.
A consumer values her beneﬁt of the commodity bundle x by using a
subjective utility function f, where f(x) > f(y) means that she prefers x to
y. A reasonable assumption about the utility function is that every convex
combination λx + (1 −λ)y of two commodity bundles should be valued as
being at least as good as the worst of the two bundles x and y, i.e. that
f(λx + (1 −λ)y) ≥min

f(x), f(y)

. The utility function f is assumed, in
other words, to be quasiconcave, and a stronger assumption, which is often
made in the economic literature and that we are making here, is that f is
concave.
Suppose now that our consumer’s income is I, that the entire income
is disposable for consumption, and that she wants to maximize her utility.

Then, the problem that she needs to solve is the convex optimization problem
max f(x)
s.t.
⟨p, x⟩≤I
x ≥0.
To determine empirically a consumer’s utility function is of course al-
most impossible, so microtheory is hardly useful for quantitative calculations.
However, one can make qualitative analyzes and answer questions of the type:
How does an increase in income change the consumer behavior? and How
does changes in the prices of the goods aﬀect the purchasing behavior?
Portfolio optimization
A person intends to buy shares in n diﬀerent companies C1, C2, . . . , Cn for S
dollars. One dollar invested in the company Cj gives a return of Rj dollars,
where Rj is a random variable with known expected value
µj = E[Rj].
The covariances
σij = E[(Ri −µi)(Rj −µj)]
are also assumed to be known.

Note that v(x) is a positive semi-deﬁnite quadratic form.
It is not possible for our person to maximize the total return, because
the return is a random variable, i.e. depends on chance. However, he can
maximize the expected total return under appropriate risk conditions, i.e.
requirements for the variance. Alternatively, he can minimize the risk with
the investment given certain requirements on the expected return.
Thus
there are several possible strategies, and we will formulate three such.
(i) The strategy to maximize the expected total return, given an upper
bound B on the variance, leads to the convex optimization problem
max e(x)
s.t.



v(x) ≤B
x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = S
x ≥0.
(ii) The strategy to minimize the variance of the total return, given a lower
bound b on the expected return, gives rise to the convex quadratic program-
ming problem
min v(x)
s.t.



e(x) ≥b
x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = S
x ≥0.
(iii) The two strategies can be considered together in the following way. Let
ϵ ≥0 be a (subjective) parameter, and consider the convex quadratic problem
min ϵv(x) −e(x)
s.t.
x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = S
x ≥0
with optimal solution x(ϵ). We leave as an exercise to show that
v(x(ϵ1)) ≥v(x(ϵ2))

e(x(ϵ1)) ≥e(x(ϵ2))

if 0 ≤ϵ1 ≤ϵ2. The parameter ϵ is thus a measure of the person’s attitude
towards risk; the smaller the ϵ, the greater the risk (= variance) but also the
greater expected return.
Snell’s law of refraction
We will study the path of a light beam which passes through n parallel
transparent layers. The j:th slice Sj is assumed to be aj units wide and to
consist of a homogeneous medium in which the speed of light is vj. We choose
a coordinate system as in ﬁgure 9.2 and consider a light beam on its path
from the origin on the surface of the ﬁrst slice to a point with y-coordinate

Overdetermined systems
If a system of linear equations Ax = b with n unknowns and m equations
is inconsistent, i.e. has no solutions, you might want to still determine the
best approximate solution, i.e. the n-tuple x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) that makes
the error as small as possible. The error is by deﬁnition the diﬀerence Ax−b
between the left and the right hand side of the equation, and as a measure
of the size of the error we use ∥Ax −b∥for some suitably chosen norm.
The function x →∥Ax −b∥is convex, so the problem of minimizing
∥Ax −b∥over all x ∈Rn is a convex problem regardless of which norm is
used, but the solution depends on the norm, of course. Let as usual aij denote
the element at location i, j in the matrix A, and let b = (b1, b2, . . . , bm).
1. The so-called least square solution is obtained by using the Euclidean
norm ∥·∥2. Since ∥Ax −b∥2

i=1(ai1x1 + ai2x2 + · · · + ainxn −bi)2, we get
the least square solution as the solution of the convex quadratic problem

The gradient of the objective function is equal to zero at the optimal point,
which means that the optimal solution is obtained as the solution to the
linear system
ATAx = ATb.
2.
By instead using the ∥·∥∞norm, one obtains the solution that gives the
smallest maximum deviation between the left and the right hand side of the
linear system Ax = b. Since
∥Ax −b∥∞= max
1≤i≤m |ai1x1 + ai2x2 + · · · + ainxn −bi|,
the objective function is now piecewise aﬃne, and the problem is therefore
equivalent to the LP problem

3.
Instead of minimizing the sum of squares of the diﬀerences between left
and right sides, we can of course minimize the sum of the absolute value of
the diﬀerences, i.e. use the ∥·∥1-norm. Since the objective function
∥Ax −b∥1 =

Largest inscribed ball
A convex set X with nonempty interior is given in Rn, and we want to
determine a ball B(x, r) in X (with respect to a given norm) with the largest
possible radius r. We assume that X can be described as the solution set to
a system of inequalities, i.e. that
X = {x ∈Rn | gi(x) ≤0, i = 1, 2, . . . , m},

with convex functions gi.
The ball B(x, r) lies in X if and only if gi(x + ry) ≤0 for all y with
∥y∥≤1 and i = 1, 2, . . . , m, which makes it natural to consider the functions
hi(x, r) = sup
∥y∥≤1
gi(x + ry),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
The functions hi are convex since they are deﬁned as suprema of convex
functions in the variables x and r.
The problem of determining the ball with the largest possible radius has
now been transformed into the convex optimization problem
max r
s.t.
hi(x, r) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
For general convex sets X, it is of course impossible to determine the
functions hi explicitly, but if X is a polyhedron, gi(x) = ⟨ci, x⟩−bi, and the
norm in question is the ℓp-norm, then it follows from H¨older’s inequality that
hi(x, r) = sup
∥y∥p≤1
(⟨ci, x⟩+ r⟨ci, y⟩−bi) = ⟨ci, x⟩+ r∥ci∥q −bi
for r ≥0, where ∥·∥q denotes the dual norm.
The problem of determining the center x and the radius r of the largest
ball that is included in the polyhedron
X = {x ∈Rn | ⟨ci, x⟩≤bi, i = 1, 2, . . . , m}
has now been reduced to the LP problem

s.t.
⟨ci, x⟩+ r∥ci∥q ≤bi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

9.2 Bob has problems with the weather. The weather occurs in the three states
pouring rain, drizzle and sunshine. Bob owns a raincoat and an umbrella,
and he is somewhat careful with his suit. The raincoat is diﬃcult to carry,
and the same applies −though to a lesser degree −to the umbrella; the
latter, however, is not fully satisfactory in case of pouring rain. The following
table reveals how happy Bob considers himself in the various situations that
can arise (the numbers are related to his blood pressure, with 0 corresponding

The winner will receive as payment the value of his winning card from the

which in the form of inequalities, we shall associate a dual maximization
problem, and the tool to accomplish this is the Lagrange function deﬁned
below. To avoid trivial matters we assume that dom f ̸= ∅, i.e. that the
objective function f : Ω→R is not identically equal to ∞on Ω.
X denotes as before the set of feasible points in the problem (P), i.e.

The Lagrange function
For each x ∈dom f, the expression L(x, λ) is the sum of a real number
and a linear form in λ1, λ2, . . . , λm. Hence, the function λ →L(x, λ) is aﬃne
(or rather, the restriction to Λ of an aﬃne function on Rm). The Lagrange
function is thus especially concave in the variable λ for each ﬁxed x ∈dom f.
If x ∈Ω\ dom f, then obviously L(x, λ) = ∞for all λ ∈Λ. Hence,
inf
x∈ΩL(x, λ) =
inf
x∈dom f L(x, λ) < ∞
for all λ ∈Λ.
Deﬁnition. For λ ∈Λ, we deﬁne
φ(λ) = inf
x∈ΩL(x, λ)
and call the function φ: Λ →R the dual function associated to the mini-
mization problem (P).
It may of course happen that the domain
dom φ = {λ ∈Λ | φ(λ > −∞}
of the dual function is empty; this occurs if the functions x →L(x, λ) are
unbounded below on Ωfor all λ ∈Λ.
Theorem 10.1.1. The dual function φ of the minimization problem (P) is
concave and
φ(λ) ≤vmin(P)
for all λ ∈Λ.
Hence, dom φ = ∅if the objective function f in the original problem (P) is
unbounded below on the constraint set, i.e. if vmin(P) = −∞.
Proof. The functions λ →L(x, λ) are concave for x ∈dom f, which means
that the function φ is the inﬁmum of a family of concave functions.
It
therefore follows from Theorem 6.2.4 in Part I that φ is concave.
Suppose λ ∈Λ and x ∈X; then λigi(x) ≤0 for i ≤p and λigi(x) = 0 for
i > p, and it follows that
L(x, λ) = f(x) +

i=1
λigi(x) ≤f(x),
and that consequently
φ(λ) = inf
x∈ΩL(x, λ) ≤inf

x∈X f(x) = vmin(P).

The Lagrange function
The following optimality criterion is now an immediate consequence of
the preceding theorem.
Theorem 10.1.2 (Optimality criterion). Suppose ˆx is a feasible point for the
minimization problem (P) and that there is a point ˆλ ∈Λ such that
φ(ˆλ) = f(ˆx).
Then ˆx is an optimal solution.
Proof. The common value f(ˆx) belongs to the intersection R∩R = R of the
codomains of f and φ, and it is thus a real number, and by Theorem 10.1.1,
f(ˆx) ≤vmin(P). Hence, f(ˆx) = vmin(P).
Example 10.1.1. Let us consider the simple minimization problem
min f(x) = x2
1 −x2
2
s.t.
x2
1 + x2
2 ≤1.
The Lagrange function is
L(x1, x2, λ) = x2
1 −x2
2 + λ(x2
1 + x2
2 −1)
= (λ + 1)x2
1 + (λ −1)x2
2 −λ
with (x1, x2) ∈R2 and λ ∈R+.
The Lagrange function is unbounded below when 0 ≤λ < 1, and it
attains the minimum value −λ for x1 = x2 = 0 when λ ≥1, so the dual
function φ is given by
φ(λ) =

−∞,
if 0 ≤λ < 1
−λ ,
if λ ≥1.
We ﬁnally note that the optimality condition φ(ˆλ) = f(ˆx) is satisﬁed by
the point ˆx = (0, 1) and the Lagrange multiplier ˆλ = 1. Hence, (0, 1) is an
optimal solution.
The optimality criterion gives a suﬃcient condition for optimality, but it
is not necessary, as the following trivial example shows.
Example 10.1.2. Consider the problem
min f(x) = x
s.t.
x2 ≤0.

The Lagrange function
35
There is only one feasible point, ˆx = 0, which is therefore the optimal solu-
tion. The Lagrange function L(x, λ) = x + λx2 is bounded below for λ > 0
and
φ(λ) = inf
x∈R(x + λx2) =

−1/4λ,
if λ > 0
−∞,
if λ = 0.
But φ(λ) < 0 = f(ˆx) for all λ ∈Λ = R+, so the optimality criterion in
Theorem 10.1.2 is not satisﬁed by the optimal point.
For the converse of Theorem 10.1.2 to hold, some extra condition is thus
needed, and we describe such a condition in Chapter 11.1.
The dual problem
In order to obtain the best possible lower estimate of the optimal value of
the minimization problem (P), we should, in the light of Theorem 10.1.1,
maximize the dual function. This leads to the following deﬁnition.

36
The Lagrange function
Deﬁnition. The optimization problem
(D)
max φ(λ)
s.t.
λ ∈Λ
is called the dual problem of the minimization problem (P).
The dual problem is a convex problem, irrespective of whether the prob-
lem (P) is convex or not, because the dual function is concave. The value of
the dual problem will be denoted by vmax(D) with the usual conventions for
±∞-values.
Our next result is now an immediate corollary of Theorem 10.1.1.
Theorem 10.1.3 (Weak duality). The following inequality holds between the
optimal values of the problem(P) and its dual problem (D):
vmax(D) ≤vmin(P).
The inequality in the above theorem is called weak duality.
If the two
optimal values are equal, i.e. if
vmax(D) = vmin(P)
then we say that strong duality holds for problem (P).
Weak duality thus holds for all problems while strong duality only holds
for special types of problems. Of course, strong duality prevails if the opti-
mality criterion in Theorem 10.1.2 is satisﬁed.
Example 10.1.3. Consider the minimization problem
min x3
1 + 2x2
s.t.
x2
1 + x2
2 ≤1.
It is easily veriﬁed that the minimum is attained for x = (0, −1) and that
the optimal value is vmin(P) = −2. The Lagrange function
L(x1, x2, λ) = x3
1 + 2x2 + λ(x2
1 + x2
2 −1) = x3
1 + λx2
1 + 2x2 + λx2
2 −λ
tends, for each ﬁxed λ ≥0, to −∞as x2 = 0 and x1 →−∞. The Lagrange
function is in other words unbounded below on R2 for each λ, and hence
φ(λ) = −∞for all λ ∈Λ.
The value of the dual problem is therefore
vmax(D) = −∞, so strong duality does not hold in this problem.
The Lagrange function, the dual function and the dual problem of a
minimization problem of the type (P) are deﬁned in terms of the constraint
functions of the problem.
Therefore, it may be worth emphasizing that

The Lagrange function
problems that are equivalent in the sense that they have the same objective
function f and the same set X of feasible points do not necessarily have
equivalent dual problems.
Thus, strong duality may hold for one way of
framing a problem but fail to hold for other ways. See exercise 10.2.
Example 10.1.4. Let us ﬁnd the dual problem of the LP problem
(LP-P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≥b
x ≥0.
Here A is an m × n-matrix, c is a vector in Rn and b a vector in Rm. Let us
rewrite the problem in the form
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
 b −Ax ≤0
x ∈Rn
+
with x ∈Rn
+ as an implicit constraint. The matrix inequality b −Ax ≤0
consists of m linear inequalities, and the Lagrangefunction is therefore deﬁned
on the product set Rn
+ × Rm
+, and it is given by
L(x, λ) = ⟨c, x⟩+ ⟨λ, b −Ax⟩= ⟨c −ATλ, x⟩+ ⟨b, λ⟩.
For ﬁxed λ, L(x, λ) is bounded below on the set Rn
+ if and only if c−ATλ ≥0,
with minimum value equal to ⟨b, λ⟩attained at x = 0. The dual function
φ: Rm
+ →R is thus given by
φ(λ) =

⟨b, λ⟩,
if ATλ ≤c
−∞,
otherwise.
The dual problem to the LP problem (LP-P) is therefore also an LP problem,
namely (after renaming the parameter λ to y) the LP problem
(LP-D)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c
y ≥0.
Note the beautiful symmetry between the two problems.
By weak duality, we know for sure that the optimal value of the maximiza-
tion problem is less than or equal to the optimal value of the minimization
problem. As we shall see later, strong duality holds for LP problems, i.e. the
two problems above have the same optimal value, provided at least one of
the problems has feasible points.

The Lagrange function
We now return to the general minimization problem

min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
with X as the set of feasible points, Lagrange function L: Ω× Λ →R,
and dual function φ. Our next theorem shows that the optimality criterion
in Theorem 10.1.2 can be formulated as a saddle point condition on the
Lagrange function.
Theorem 10.1.4. Suppose (ˆx, ˆλ) ∈Ω×Λ. The following three conditions are
equivalent for the optimization problem (P):
(i) ˆx ∈X and f(ˆx) = φ(ˆλ), i.e. the optimality criterion is satisﬁed.
(ii) For all (x, λ) ∈Ω× Λ,
L(ˆx, λ) ≤L(ˆx, ˆλ) ≤L(x, ˆλ),
i.e. (ˆx, ˆλ) is a saddle point for the Lagrange function.
(iii) ˆx ∈X, ˆx minimizes the function x →L(x, ˆλ) when x runs through Ω,
and
ˆλigi(ˆx) = 0
for i = 1, 2, . . . , p.
Thus, ˆx is an optimal solution to the problem (P) if any of the equivalent
conditions (i)–(iii) is satisﬁed.
The condition in (iii) that ˆλigi(ˆx) = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , p is called com-
plementarity. An equivalent way to express this, which explains the name,
is
ˆλi = 0
or
gi(ˆx) = 0.
A constraint with a positive Lagrange multiplier is thus necessarily active at
the point ˆx.
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii): For ˆx ∈X and arbitrary λ ∈Λ (= Rp
+ × Rn−p) we have
L(ˆx, λ) = f(ˆx) +

If f(ˆx) = φ(ˆλ), then consequently
L(ˆx, λ) ≤f(ˆx) = φ(ˆλ) ≤L(x, ˆλ)
for all (x, λ) ∈Ω× Λ, and by the particular choice of x = ˆx, λ = ˆλ in
this inequality, we see that f(ˆx) = L(ˆx, ˆλ). This proves the saddle point
inequality in (ii) with L(ˆx, ˆλ) = f(ˆx).
(ii) ⇒(iii): It is obvious that ˆx minimizes the function L( · , ˆλ) if and only
if the right part of the saddle point inequality holds. The minimum value is
moreover ﬁnite (due to our tacit assumption dom f ̸= ∅), and hence f(ˆx) is
a ﬁnite number.
The left part of the saddlepoint inequality means that

The Lagrange function
Now ﬁx the index k and choose in the above inequality the number λ so
that λi = ˆλi for all i except i = k. It follows that
(10.1)
(λk −ˆλk)gk(ˆx) ≤0
for all such λ.
If k > p, we choose λk = ˆλk ± 1 with the conclusion that ±gk(ˆx) ≤0, i.e.
that gk(ˆx) = 0. For k ≤p we instead choose λk = ˆλk +1, with the conclusion
that gk(ˆx) ≤0. Thus, ˆx satisﬁes all the constraints, i.e. ˆx ∈X.
For k ≤p we ﬁnally choose λk = 0 and λk = 2ˆλk, respectively, in the
inequality (10.1) with ±ˆλkgk(ˆx) ≤0 as result. This means that ˆλkgk(ˆx) = 0
for k ≤p, and the implication (ii) ⇒(iii) is now proved.
(iii) ⇒(i): From (iii) follows at once
φ(ˆλ) = inf
x∈ΩL(x, ˆλ) = L(ˆx, ˆλ) = f(ˆx) +

i=1
ˆλigi(ˆx) = f(ˆx),
which is condition (i).
If the objective and constraint functions f and g1, g2, . . . , gm are diﬀer-
entiable, so is the Lagrange function L(x, λ) = f(x) + m
i=1 λigi(x), and we
use L′
x(x0, λ) as the notation for the value of the derivative of the function

If the diﬀerentiable function x →L(x, λ) has a minimum at an inte-

x(x0, λ) = 0. The following corollary is thus an
immediate consequence of the implication (i) ⇒(iii) in Theorem 10.1.4.
Corollary 10.1.5. Suppose that ˆx is an optimal solution to the minimization
problem (P), that ˆx is an interior point of the domain Ω, that the objec-
tive and constraint functions are diﬀerentiable at ˆx, and that the optimality
criterion f(ˆx) = φ(ˆλ) is satisﬁed by some Lagrange multiplier ˆλ ∈Λ. Then

John’s theorem
Conditions which guarantee that the KKT condition is satisﬁed at an optimal
point, are usually called constraint qualiﬁcation conditions, and in the next
chapter we will describe such a condition for convex problems. In this section
we will study a diﬀerent qualifying condition, John’s condition, for general
optimization problems with constraints in the form of inequalities.
Let us therefore consider a problem of the form

with implicit constraint set Ω, i.e. domain for the objective and the constraint
functions.
Whether a constraint is active or not at an optimal point plays a ma-
jor role, and aﬃne constraints are thereby easier to handle than other con-
straints. Therefore, we introduce the following notations:
Iaﬀ(x) = {i | the function gi is aﬃne and gi(x) = 0},
Ioth(x) = {i | the function gi is not aﬃne and gi(x) = 0},
I(x) = Iaﬀ(x) ∪Ioth(x).
So Iaﬀ(x) consists of the indices of all active aﬃne constraints at the point
x, Ioth(x) consists of the indices of all other active constraints at the point,
and I(x) consists of the indices of all active constraints at the point.
Theorem 10.2.1 (John’s theorem). Suppose ˆx is a local minimum point for
the problem (P), that ˆx is an interior point in Ω, and that the functions f
and g1, g2, . . . , gm are diﬀerentiable at the point ˆx. If there exists a vector

x(ˆx, ˆλ) = 0
ˆλigi(ˆx) = 0
for i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
Remark 1. According to Theorem 3.3.5 in Part I, the system (J) is solvable
if and only if







i∈I(ˆx)
uig′
i(ˆx) = 0
u ≥0
⇒ui = 0
for all i ∈Ioth(ˆx).
The system (J) is thus in particular solvable if the gradient vectors ∇gi(ˆx)
are linearly independent for i ∈I(ˆx).
Remark 2. If Ioth(ˆx) = ∅, then (J) is trivially satisﬁed by z = 0.
Proof. Let Z denote the set of solutions to the system (J). The ﬁrst part
of the proof consists in showing that Z is a subset of the conic halfspace
{z ∈Rn | −⟨f ′(ˆx), z⟩≥0}.
Assume therefore that z ∈Z and consider the halﬂine ˆx −tz for t ≥0.
We claim that ˆx −tz ∈X for all suﬃciently small t > 0.
If g is an aﬃne function, i.e. has the form g(x) = ⟨c, x⟩+b, then g′(x) = c
and g(x + y) = ⟨c, x + y⟩+ b = ⟨c, x⟩+ b + ⟨c, y⟩= g(x) + ⟨g′(x), y⟩for all x
and y. Hence, for all indices i ∈Iaﬀ(ˆx),
gi(ˆx −tz) = gi(ˆx) −t⟨g′
i(ˆx), z⟩= −t⟨g′
i(ˆx), z⟩≤0
for all t ≥0.
For indices i ∈Ioth(ˆx), we obtain instead, using the chain rule, the in-
equality
d
dt gi(ˆx −tz)|t=0 = −⟨g′
i(ˆx), z⟩< 0.
The function t →gi(ˆx −tz) is in other words decreasing at the point t = 0,
whence gi(ˆx −tz) < gi(ˆx) = 0 for all suﬃciently small t > 0.
If the i:th constraint is inactive at ˆx, i.e. if i /∈I(ˆx), then gi(ˆx) < 0, and
it follows from continuity that gi(ˆx −tz) < 0 for all suﬃciently small t > 0.
We have thus proved that the points ˆx −tz belong to the constraint set
X if t > 0 is suﬃciently small. Since ˆx is a local minimum point of f, it
follows that f(ˆx −tz) ≥f(ˆx) for all suﬃciently small t > 0. Consequently,

So the vector −f ′(ˆx) belongs to the cone generated by the vektors g′

i ∈I(ˆx), which means that there are nonnegative integers ˆλi, i ∈I(ˆx), such
that

The condition in John’s statement that the system (J) has a solution
can be replaced with other qualifying constraints but can not be completely
removed without the conclusion being lost. This is shown by the following
example.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The Lagrange function
imply that (x1 + 1)2 + (x2 −1)2 ≤1, and consequently, −2 ≤x1 ≤0,
0 ≤x2 ≤2, and 0 ≤x3 ≤7. Since the objective function is continuous,
there is indeed an optimal solution.
Let us now ﬁrst investigate whether the system (J) is solvable. We use the
equivalent version (J′) in the remark after the theorem. First note that the
gradients of the constraint functions are never equal to zero. The condition
(J′) is thus met in the points where only one of the constraints is active.
Assume therefore that x is a point where I(x) = {1, 2}, i.e. where both
constraints are active, and that u1(2, −2, 1) + u2(2x1, 2x2, −1) = (0, 0, 0). If
u2 > 0, we conclude from the above equation that u1 = u2, x1 = −1 and
x2 = 1. Inserting x1 = −1 and x2 = 1 into the two active constraints yields
x3 = 3 and x3 = 2, respectively, which is contradictory. Thus, u2 = 0, which
means that the condition (J′) is fulﬁlled at all feasible points.
We conclude that the optimal point satisﬁes the KKT-condition, which
in this instance is as follows

λ1(2x1 −2x2 + x3 + 1) = 0
(iv)

(v)
The further investigation is divided into two cases.
λ1 = 0 :
Equation (iii) implies that λ2 = 1, which inserted into (i) and (ii)
gives x1 = x2 = 0, and from (v) now follows x3 = 0. But this is a false
solution, since (0, 0, 0) /∈X.
λ1 > 0 : Equation (iv) now implies that
2x1 −2x2 + x3 + 1 = 0.

From (i) and (ii) follows (x1 + x2)(1 + 2λ2) = 0, and since λ2 ≥0,
x1 + x2 = 0.

Convex optimization
Chapter 11
Convex optimization
11.1
Strong duality
We recall that the minimization problem
(P)
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
is called convex if
• the implicit constraint set Ωis convex,
• the objective function f is convex,
• the constraint functions gi are convex for i = 1, 2, . . . , p and aﬃne for
i = p + 1, . . . , m.
The set X of feasible points is convex in a convex optimization problem,
and the Lagrange function
L(x, λ) = f(x) +
m

i=1
λigi(x)
is convex in the variable x for each ﬁxed λ ∈Λ = Rp
+ × Rm−p, since it is a
conic combination of convex functions.
We have already noted that the optimality criterion in Theorem 10.1.2
need not be fulﬁlled at an optimal point, not even for convex problems,
because of the trivial counterexample in Example 10.1.2. For the criterion
to be met some additional condition is needed, and a weak one is given in
the next deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition. The problem (P) satisﬁes Slater’s condition if there is a feasible
point x in the relative interior of Ωsuch that gi(x) < 0 for each non-aﬃne
constraint function gi.

Convex optimization
Slater’s condition is of course vacously fulﬁlled if all constraint functions
are aﬃne.
For convex problems that satisfy Slater’s condition, the optimality cri-
terion is both suﬃcient and necessary for optimality. We have namely the
following result.
Theorem 11.1.1 (Duality theorem). Suppose that the problem (P) is convex
and satisﬁes Slater’s condition, and that the optimal value vmin is ﬁnite. Let
φ: Λ →R denote the dual function of the problem. Then there is a point
ˆλ ∈Λ such that
φ(ˆλ) = vmin.
Proof. First suppose that all constraints are inequalities, i.e. that p = m, and
renumber the constraints so that the functions gi are convex and non-aﬃne
for i = 1, 2, . . . , k and aﬃne for i = k + 1, . . . , m.
Because of Slater’s condition, the system
gi(x) < 0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , k
gi(x) ≤0,
i = k + 1, . . . , m
has a solution in the relative interior of Ω, whereas the system



f(x) −vmin < 0
gi(x) < 0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , k
gi(x) ≤0,
i = k + 1, . . . , m
lacks solutions in Ω, due to the deﬁnition of vmin. Therefore, it follows from
Theorem 6.5.1 in Part I that there exist nonnegative scalars ˆλ0, ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλm
such that at least one of the numbers ˆλ0, ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλk is positive and
ˆλ0(f(x) −vmin) + ˆλ1g1(x) + ˆλ2g2(x) + · · · + ˆλmgm(x) ≥0
for all x ∈Ω. Here, the coeﬃcient ˆλ0 has to be positive, because if ˆλ0 = 0
then ˆλ1g1(x) + · · · + ˆλmgm(x) ≥0 for all x ∈Ω, which contradicts the fact
that the ﬁrst mentioned system of inequalities has a solution in Ω. We may
therefore assume, by dividing by ˆλ0 if necessary, that ˆλ0 = 1, and this gives
us the inequality
L(x, ˆλ) = f(x) +
m

i=1
ˆλigi(x) ≥vmin
for all x ∈Ω. It follows that
φ(ˆλ) = inf
x∈ΩL(x, ˆλ) ≥vmin,
which combined with Theorem 10.1.1 yields the desired equality φ(ˆλ) = vmin.

If the problem has aﬃne equality constraints, i.e. if p < m, we replace
each equality gi(x) = 0 with the two inequalities ±gi(x) ≤0, and it follows
from the already proven case of the theorem that there exist nonnegative
Lagrange multipliers ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλp, ˆµp+1, . . . , ˆµm, ˆνp+1, . . . , ˆνm such that

point ˆλ ∈Λ = Rp
+ × Rm−p which satisﬁes φ(ˆλ) ≥vmin, and this completes
the proof of the theorem.
By combining Theorem 11.1.1 with Theorem 10.1.2 we get the following
corollary.
Corollary 11.1.2. Suppose that the problem (P) is convex and that it satisﬁes
Slater’s condition. Then, a feasible point ˆx is optimal if and only if it satisﬁes
the optimality criterion, i.e. if and only if there exists a ˆλ ∈Λ such that
φ(ˆλ) = f(ˆx).

11.2
The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker theorem
Variants of the following theorem were ﬁrst proved by Karush and Kuhn–
Tucker, and the theorem is therefore usually called the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker
theorem.
Theorem 11.2.1. Let
(P)
min f(x)
s.t.
gi(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , p
gi(x) = 0,
i = p + 1, . . . , m
be a convex problem, and suppose that the objective and constraint functions
are diﬀerentiable at the feasible point ˆx.
(i) If ˆλ is a point in Λ and the pair (ˆx, ˆλ) satisﬁes the KKT-condition

L′
x(ˆx, ˆλ) = 0
ˆλigi(ˆx) = 0
for i = 1, 2, . . . , p
then strong duality prevails; ˆx is an optimal solution to the problem (P)
and ˆλ is an optimal solution to the dual problem.
(ii) Conversely, if Slater’s condition is fulﬁlled and ˆx is an optimal solution,
then there exist Lagrange multipliers ˆλ ∈Λ such that (ˆx, ˆλ) satisﬁes the
KKT-condition.
Proof. (i) The KKT-condition implies that ˆx is a stationary point of the
convex function x →L(x, ˆλ), and an interior stationary point of a convex
function is a minimum point, according to Theorem 7.2.2 in Part I. Condition
(iii) in Theorem 10.1.4 is thus fulﬁlled, and this means that the optimality
criterion is satisﬁed by the pair (ˆx, ˆλ).
(ii) Conversely, if Slater’s condition is satisﬁed and ˆx is an optimal solu-
tion, then the optimality criterion f(ˆx) = φ(ˆλ) is satisﬁed by some ˆλ ∈Λ,
according to Theorem 11.1.1. The KKT-condition is therefore met because
of Corollary 10.1.5.
The KKT-condition has a natural geometrical interpretation. Assume for
simplicity that all constraints are inequalities, i.e. that p = m, and let I(ˆx)
denote the index set for the constraints that are active at the optimal point
ˆx. The KKT-condition means that ˆλi = 0 for all indices i /∈I(ˆx) and that

where all coeﬃcients ˆλi occuring in the sum are nonnegative. The geometrical
meaning of the above equality is that the vector −∇f(ˆx) belongs to the cone
generated by the gradients ∇gi(ˆx) of the active inequality constraints. Cf.

x3 −4 ≤0.
The objective and the constraint functions are convex. Slater’s condition is
satisﬁed, since for instance (1, 1, 1) satisﬁes both constraints strictly. Accord-
ing to Theorem 11.2.1, x is therefore an optimal solution to the problem if
and only if x solves the system

LINEAR AND CONVEX OPTIMIZATION: 
CONVEXITY AND OPTIMIZATION – PART II
55
Convex optimization
The Lagrange function and the dual function associated to the minimiza-
tion problem (Pb) are denoted by Lb and φb, respectively. By deﬁnition,
Lb(x, λ) = f(x) +
m

i=1
λi(gi(x) −bi),
and the relationship between the Lagrange functions Lb and Lb belonging to
two diﬀerent parameter vectors b and b, is therefore given by the equation
Lb(x, λ) = Lb(x, λ) +
m

i=1
λi(bi −bi) = Lb(x, λ) + ⟨λ, b −b⟩.
By forming the inﬁmum over x ∈Ω, we immediately get the following relation
for the dual functions:
(11.1)
φb(λ) = φb(λ) + ⟨λ, b −b⟩.
The following theorem gives an interpretation of the Lagrange parameters
in problems which satisfy the optimality criterion in Theorem 10.1.2, and thus
especially for convex problems which satisfy Slater’s condition.
Theorem 11.3.1. Suppose that the minimization problem (Pb) has an optimal
solution x and that the optimality criterion is satisﬁed at the point, i.e. that
there are Lagrange multipliers λ such that φb(λ) = f(x). Then:
(i) The objective function f is bounded below on X(b) for each b ∈Rm,
so the optimal value vmin(b) of problem (Pb) is ﬁnite if the set X(b) of
feasible points is nonempty, and equal to +∞if X(b) = ∅.
(ii) The vector −λ is a subgradient at the point b of the optimal value func-
tion vmin : Rm →R.
(iii) Suppose that the optimality criterion is satisﬁed in the problem (Pb) for
all b in an open convex set U. The restriction of the function vmin to
U is then a convex function.
Proof. By using weak duality for problem (Pb), the identity (11.1) and the
optimality criterion for problem (Pb), we obtain the following inequality:
vmin(b) =
inf
x∈X(b) f(x) ≥φb(λ) = φb(λ) + ⟨λ, b −b⟩= f(x) + ⟨λ, b −b⟩
= vmin(b) −⟨λ, b −b⟩.
It follows, ﬁrst, that the optimal value vmin(b) can not be equal to −∞, and
second, that −λ is a subgradient of the function vmin at the point b.
If the optimality criterion is satisﬁed at all b ∈U, then vmin has a sub-
gradient at all points in U, and such a function is convex.

Convex optimization
Now suppose that the function vmin is diﬀerentiable at the point b. The
gradient at the point b is then, by Theorem 8.1.3 in Part I, the unique
subgradient at the point, so it follows from (ii) in the above theorem that
v′
min(b) = −λ. This gives us the approximation
vmin(b1 + ∆b1, . . . , bm + ∆bm) ≈vmin(b1, . . . , bm) −λ1∆b1 · · · −λm∆bm
for small increments ∆bj. So the Lagrange multipliers provide information
about how the optimal value is aﬀected by small changes in the parameters.
Example 11.3.1. As an illustration of Theorem 11.3.1, let us study the con-
vex problem
min x2
1 + x2
2
s.t.
 x1 + 2x2 ≤b1
2x1 + x2 ≤b2.
Since it is about minimizing the distance squared from the origin to a poly-
hedron, there is certainly an optimal solution for each right-hand side b, and
since the constraints are aﬃne, it follows from the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker
theorem that the optimal solution satisﬁes the KKT-condition, which in the
present case is the system


2x1 + λ1 + 2λ2 = 0
(i)
2x2 + 2λ1 + λ2 = 0
(ii)
λ1(x1 + 2x2 −b1) = 0
(iii)
λ2(2x1 + x2 −b2) = 0
(iv)
λ1, λ2 ≥0.
We now solve this system by considering four separate cases:
λ1 = λ2 = 0 : In this case, x1 = x2 = 0 is the unique solution to the KKT-
system. Thus, the point (0, 0) is optimal provided it is feasible, and so is the
case if and only if b1 ≥0 and b2 ≥0. The optimal value for these parameter
values is vmin(b) = 0.
λ1 > 0, λ2 = 0 : From (i) and (ii), it follows ﬁrst that x2 = 2x1 = −λ1, and
(iii) then gives x = 1
5(b1, 2b1). This point is feasible if 2x1 + x2 = 4
5b1 ≤b2,
and for the Lagrange multiplier λ1 = −2
5b1 to be positive, we must also have
b1 < 0. Thus, the point x = 1
5(b1, 2b1) is optimal if b1 < 0 and 4b1 ≤5b2, and
the corresponding value is vmin(b) = 1
5b2
1.
λ1 = 0, λ2 > 0 : From (i) and (ii), it now follows that x1 = 2x2 = −λ2,
which inserted into (iv) gives x =
1
5(2b2, b2).
This is a feasible point if
x1 +2x2 = 4
5b2 ≤b1. The Lagrange multiplier λ2 = −2
5b2 is positive if b2 < 0.

Hence, the point x = 1
5(2b2, b2) is optimal and the optimal value is v(b) = 1

if b2 < 0 och 4b2 ≤5b1.
λ1 > 0, λ2 > 0: By solving the subsystem obtained from (iii) and (iv), we

shares in three companies: A, B and C. Company A manufactures mobile

Expected return:

companies, is thus equal to

The investment risk is by deﬁnition the variance of the return. To calculate
this we need to know the variance of each company’s return and the corre-
lation between the returns of the various companies. For obvious reasons,

Linear programming
Chapter 12
Linear programming
Linear programming (LP) is the art of optimizing linear functions over poly-
hedra, described as solution sets to systems of linear inequalities. In this
chapter, we describe and study the basic mathematical theory of linear pro-
gramming, above all the very important duality concept.
12.1
Optimal solutions
The optimal value of a general optimization problem was deﬁned in Chap-
ter 9. In particular, each LP problem
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
x ∈X
has an optimal value, which in this section will be denoted by vmin(c) to
indicate its dependence of the objective function.
LP problems with ﬁnite optimal values always have optimal solutions.
The existence of an optimal solution is of course obvious if the polyhedron of
feasible points is bounded, i.e. compact, since the objective function is con-
tinuous. For arbitrary LP problems, we rely on the representation theorem
for polyhedra to prove the existence of optimal solutions.
Theorem 12.1.1. Suppose that the polyhedron X of feasible solutions in the
LP problem (P) is nonempty and a subset of Rn. Then we have:
(i) The value function vmin : Rn →R is concave with eﬀective domain
dom vmin = (recc X)+.
The objective function ⟨c, x⟩is, in other words, bounded below on X if
and only if c belongs to the dual cone of the recession cone of X.

(ii) The problem has optimal solutions for each c ∈(recc X)+, and the set
of optimal solutions is a polyhedron. Moreover, the optimum is attained
at some extreme point of X if X is a line-free polyhedron.
Proof. By deﬁnition, the optimal value vmin(c) = inf{⟨c, x⟩| x ∈X} is
the pointwise inﬁmum of a family of concave functions, namely the linear
functions c →⟨c, x⟩, with x running through X. So the value function vmin
is concave by Theorem 6.2.4 in Part I.
Let us now determine dom vmin, i.e. the set of c such that vmin(c) > −∞.
By the structure theorem for polyhedra (Theorem 5.3.1 in Part I), there is a
ﬁnite nonempty set A such that X = cvx A + recc X, where A = ext X if the
polyhedron is line-free. The optimal value vmin(c) can therefore be calculated
as follows:
vmin(c) = inf{⟨c, y + z⟩| y ∈cvx A, z ∈recc X}
(12.1)
= inf{⟨c, y⟩| y ∈cvx A} + inf{⟨c, z⟩| z ∈recc X}
= min{⟨c, y⟩| y ∈A} + inf{⟨c, z⟩| z ∈recc X},
The equality inf{⟨c, y⟩| y ∈cvx A} = min{⟨c, y⟩| y ∈A} holds because of
Theorem 6.3.3 in Part I, since linear functions are concave.
If c belongs to the dual cone (recc X)+, then ⟨c, z⟩≥0 for all vectors
z ∈recc X with equality for z = 0, and it follows from equation (12.1) that
vmin(c) = min{⟨c, y⟩| y ∈A} > −∞.
This proves the inclusion (recc X)+ ⊆dom vmin, and that the optimal value
is attained at a point in A, and then in particular at some extreme point of
X if the polyhedron X is line-free.
If c /∈(recc X)+, then ⟨c, z0⟩< 0 for some vector z0 ∈recc X. Since
tz0 ∈recc X for t > 0 and limt→∞⟨c, tz0⟩= −∞, it follows that
inf{⟨c, z⟩| z ∈recc X} = −∞,
and equation (12.1) now implies that vmin(c) = −∞. This concludes the
proof of the equality dom vmin = (recc X)+.
The set of minimum points to an LP problem with ﬁnite value vmin is
equal to the intersection
X ∩{x ∈Rn | ⟨c, x⟩= vmin}
between the polyhedron X and a hyperplane, and it is consequently a poly-
hedron.

Suppose that X = {x ∈Rn | Ax ≥b} is a line-free polyhedron and
that we want to minimize a given linear function over X. To determine the
optimal value of this LP problem, we need according to the previous theorem,
assuming that the objective function is bounded below on X, only calculate
function values at the ﬁnitely many extreme points of X. In theory, this

is easy, but in practice it can be an insurmountable problem, because the
number of extreme points may be extremely high. The number of potential
extreme points of X when A is an m × n-matrix, equals
m
n

, which for
m = 100 and n = 50 is a number that is greater than 1029. The simplex
algorithm, which we will study in Chapter 13, is based on the idea that
it is not necessary to search through all the extreme points; the algorithm
generates instead a sequence x1, x2, x3, . . . of extreme points with decreasing
objective function values ⟨c, x1⟩≥⟨c, x2⟩≥⟨c, x3⟩≥. . . until the minimum
point is found. The number of extreme points that needs to be investigated
is therefore generally relatively small.

with ﬁnite sets A and B. We know from the preceding theorem and its proof
that a feasible point x is optimal for the LP problem if and only if

⟨c, a⟩≥⟨c, x⟩
for all a ∈A
⟨c, b⟩≥0
for all b ∈B,
and these inequalities deﬁne a convex cone Cx in the variable c. The set of
all c for which a given feasible point is optimal, is thus a convex cone.
Now suppose that x is indeed an optimal solution to (P). How much
can we change the coeﬃcients of the objective function without changing
the optimal solution? The study of this issue is an example of sensitivity
analysis.
Expressed in terms of the cone Cx, the answer is simple: If we change
the coeﬃcients of the objective function to c + ∆c, then x is also an optimal
solution to the perturbed LP problem
(P′)
min ⟨c + ∆c, x⟩
s.t.
x ∈X
if and only if c + ∆c belongs to the cone Cx, i.e. if and only if ∆c lies in the
polyhedron −c + Cx.
In summary, we have thus come to the following conclusions.
Theorem 12.1.2.
(i) The set of all c for which a given feasible point is
optimal in the LP problem (P), is a convex cone.
(ii) If x is an optimal solution to problem (P), then there is a polyhedron
such that x is also an optimal solution to the perturbed LP problem (P ′)
for all ∆c in the polyhedron.
The set {∆ck | ∆c ∈−c + Cx and ∆cj = 0 for j ̸= k} is a (possibly un-
bounded) closed interval [−dk, ek] around 0. An optimal solution to the prob-
lem (P) is therefore also optimal for the perturbed problem that is obtained
by only varying the objective coeﬃcient ck, provided that the perturbation
∆ck lies in the interval −dk ≤∆ck ≤ek.
Many computer programs for
LP problems, in addition to generating the optimal value and the optimal
solution, also provide information about these intervals.
Sensitivity analysis will be studied in connection with the simplex algo-
rithm in Chapter13.7.
Example 12.1.2. The printout of a computer program that was used to solve
an LP problem with c = (20, 30, 40, . . . ) contained among other things the
following information:

Use the printout to determine the optimal solution and the optimal value
if the coeﬃcients c1, c2 and c3 are changed to 17, 35 and 45, respectively, and
the other objective coeﬃcients are left unchanged.
Solution: The columns ”Allowable decrease” and ”Allowable increase” show
that the polyhedron of changes ∆c that do not aﬀect the optimal solution
contains the vectors (−15, 0, 0, 0, . . . ), (0, 10, 0, 0, . . . ) and (0, 0, 20, 0, . . . ).
Since
(−3, 5, 5, 0, . . . ) = 1
5(−15, 0, 0, 0, . . . ) + 1
2(0, 10, 0, 0, . . . ) + 1

changes that do not aﬀect the optimal solutions, namley the three changes
mentioned above and (0, 0, 0, 0, . . . ).
The solution x = (50, 40, 10, . . . ) is
therefore still optimal for the LP problem with c = (17, 35, 45, . . . ). However,
the new optimal value is of course 4000 −20 · 3 + 30 · 5 + 40 · 5 = 4290.
12.2
Duality
Dual problems
By describing the polyhedron X in a linear minimization problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
x ∈X
as the solution set of a system of linear inequalities, we get a problem with
a corresponding Lagrange function, and hence also a dual function and a
dual problem. The description of X as a solution set is of course not unique,
so the dual problem is not uniquely determined by X as a polyhedron, but
whichever description we choose, we get, according to Theorem 11.1.1, a dual
problem, where strong duality holds, because Slater’s condition is satisﬁed
for convex problems with aﬃne constraints.

In this section, we describe the dual problem for some commonly occur-
ring polyhedron descriptions, and we give an alternative proof of the duality
theorem. Our premise is that the polyhedron X is given as
X = {x ∈U + | Ax −b ∈V +},
where
• U and V are ﬁnitely generated cones in Rn and Rm, respectively;
• A is an m × n-matrix;
• b is a vector in Rm.
As usual, we identify vectors with column matrices and matrices with linear
transformations. The set X is of course a polyhedron, for by writing
X = U + ∩A−1(b + V +)
we see that X is an intersection of two polyhedra −the conical polyhe-
dron U + and the inverse image A−1(b + V +) under the linear map A of the
polyhedron b + V +.

The LP problem of minimizing ⟨c, x⟩over the polyhedron X with the
above description will now be written
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax −b ∈V +, x ∈U +
and in order to form a suitable dual problem we will perceive the condition
x ∈U + as an implicit constraint and express the other condition Ax−b ∈V +
as a system of linear inequalities. Assume therefore that the ﬁnitely generated
cone V is generated by the columns of the m × k-matrix D, i.e. that
V = {Dz | z ∈Rk
+}.
The dual cone V + can then be written as
V + = {y ∈Rm | DTy ≥0},
and the constraint Ax −b ∈V + can now be expressed as a system of in-
equalities, namely DTAx −DTb ≥0.
Our LP problem (P) has thus been transformed into
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
DTb −DTAx ≤0, x ∈U +.
The associated Lagrange function L: U + × Rk
+ →R is deﬁned by
L(x, λ) = ⟨c, x⟩+ ⟨λ, DTb −DTAx⟩= ⟨c −ATDλ, x⟩+ ⟨b, Dλ⟩,
and the corresponding dual function φ: Rk
+ →R is given by
φ(λ) = inf
x∈U+ L(x, λ) =

⟨b, Dλ⟩,
if c −ATDλ ∈U
−∞,
otherwise.
This gives us a dual problem of the form
max ⟨b, Dλ⟩
s.t.
c −ATDλ ∈U, λ ∈Rk
+.
Since Dλ describes the cone V as λ runs through Rk
+, we can by setting
y = Dλ reformulate the dual problem so that it becomes
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
c −ATy ∈U, y ∈V.
It is therefore natural to deﬁne duality for LP problems of the form (P) as
follows.

Deﬁnition. Given the LP problem
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax −b ∈V +, x ∈U +,
which we call the primal problem, we call the problem
(D)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
c −ATy ∈U, y ∈V
the dual LP problem.
The optimal values of the two problems are denoted by vmin(P) and
vmax(D). The polyhedron of feasible points will be denoted by X for the
primal problem and by Y for the dual problem.
Example 12.2.1. Diﬀerent choices of the cones U and V give us diﬀerent
concrete dual problems (P) and (D). We exemplify with four important spe-
cial cases.
1. The choice U = {0}, U + = Rn and V = V + = Rm
+ gives us the following
dual pair:
(P1)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≥b
and
(D1)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy = c, y ≥0.
Every LP problem can be expressed in the form (P1), because every poly-
hedron can be expressed as an intersection of halfspaces, i.e. be written as
Ax ≥b.
2. The choice U = U + = Rn
+ and V = V + = Rm
+ gives instead the dual pair:
(P2)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≥b, x ≥0
and
(D2)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c, y ≥0.
This is the most symmetric formulation of duality, and the natural formu-
lation for many application problems with variables that represent physical
quantities or prices, which of course are nonnegative. The diet problem and
the production planning problem in Chapter 9.4 are examples of such prob-
lems.
3. U = U + = Rn
+, V = Rm and V + = {0} result in the dual pair:
(P3)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
and
(D3)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c.
The formulation (P3) is the natural starting point for the simplex algo-
rithm.

feasible points for the dual maximization problem are of the form
y = (t, 1 + t, 2t)
with t ≥0, and the corresponding values of the objective function are 1−7t.
The maximum value is attained for t = 0 at the point (0, 1, 0), and the
maximum value is equal to 1.
The Duality Theorem
The primal and dual problems in Examples 12.2.2 and 12.2.3 have the same
optimal value, and this is no coincidence but a consequence of the duality
theorem, which is formulated below and is a special case of the duality the-
orem for general convex problems (Theorem 11.1.1). In this section we give
an alternative proof of this important theorem, and we start with the trivial
result about weak duality.
Theorem 12.2.1 (Weak duality). The optimal values of the two dual LP prob-
lems (P) and (D) satisfy the inequality
vmax(D) ≤vmin(P).
Proof. The inequality is trivially satisﬁed if any of the two polyhedra X and
Y of feasible points is empty, because if Y = ∅then vmax(D) = −∞, by
deﬁnition, and if X = ∅then vmin(P) = +∞, by deﬁnition.
Assume therefore that both problems have feasible points. If x ∈X and
y ∈Y , then y ∈V , (Ax−b) ∈V +, (c−ATy) ∈U and x ∈U +, by deﬁnition,
and hence ⟨Ax −b, y⟩≥0 and ⟨c −ATy, x⟩≥0. It follows that
⟨b, y⟩≤⟨b, y⟩+ ⟨c −ATy, x⟩= ⟨b, y⟩+ ⟨c, x⟩−⟨y, Ax⟩
= ⟨c, x⟩+ ⟨b, y⟩−⟨Ax, y⟩= ⟨c, x⟩−⟨Ax −b, y⟩≤⟨c, x⟩.
The objective function ⟨b, y⟩in the maximization problem (D) is in other
words bounded above on Y by ⟨c, x⟩for each x ∈X, and hence
vmax(D) = sup
y∈Y
⟨b, y⟩≤⟨c, x⟩.
The objective function ⟨c, x⟩in the minimization problem (P) is therefore
bounded below on X by vmax(D). This implies that vmax(D) ≤vmin(P) and
completes the proof of the theorem.
The following optimality criterion follows from weak duality.

Theorem 12.2.2 (Optimality criterion). Suppose that ˆx is a feasible point for
the minimization problem (P), that ˆy is a feasible point for the dual maxi-
mization problem (D), and that
⟨c, ˆx⟩= ⟨b, ˆy⟩.
Then ˆx and ˆy are optimal solutions of the respective problems.
Proof. The assumptions on ˆx and ˆy combined with Theorem 12.2.1 give us
the following chain of inequalities
vmax(D) ≥⟨b, ˆy⟩= ⟨c, ˆx⟩≥vmin(P) ≥vmax(D).
Since the two extreme ends are equal, there is equality everywhere, which
means that ˆy is a maximum point and ˆx is a minimum point.
Theorem 12.2.3 (Duality theorem). Suppose that at least one of the two dual
LP problems
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax −b ∈V +, x ∈U +
(P)
and
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
c −ATy ∈U, y ∈V
(D)
has feasible points. Then, the two problem have the same optimal value.
Thus, provided that at least one of the two dual problems has feasible points:
(i) X = ∅⇔the objective function ⟨b, y⟩is not bounded above on Y .
(ii) Y = ∅⇔the objective function ⟨c, x⟩is not bounded below on X.
(iii) If X ̸= ∅and Y ̸= ∅, then there exist points ˆx ∈X and ˆy ∈Y such
that ⟨b, y⟩≤⟨b, ˆy⟩= ⟨c, ˆx⟩≤⟨c, x⟩for all x ∈X and all y ∈Y .
The duality theorem for linear programming problems is a special case
of the general duality theorem for convex problems, but we give here an
alternative proof based directly on the following variant of Farkas’s lemma.

(12.3′′)

d −˜AT˜y ∈{0} × U
˜y ∈R+ × V .
Since
˜AT =
 α
−bT
−c

,
we obtain the following equivalent system from (12.3′′) by setting ˜y = (s, y)
with s ∈R and y ∈Rm:
(12.3′)







−1 −αs + ⟨b, y⟩= 0
cs −ATy ∈U
y ∈V
s ≥0.
The system (12.2) is thus solvable if and only if the system (12.3′) has no
solutions, and by considering the cases s > 0 and s = 0 separately, we see
that the system (12.3′) has no solutions if and only if the two systems






⟨b, y/s⟩= α+1/s
c −AT(y/s) ∈U
y/s ∈V
s > 0
and



⟨b, y⟩= 1
−ATy ∈U
y ∈V
have no solutions, and this is obviously the case if and only if the systems
(12.3-A) and (12.3-B) both lack solutions.
Proof of the duality theorem. We now return to the proof of the duality
theorem, and because of weak duality, we only need to show the inequality
(12.4)
vmin(P) ≤vmax(D).
We divide the proof of this inequality in three separate cases.

Linear programming
Case 1. Y ̸= ∅and the system (12.3-B) has no solution.
The inequality (12.4) is trivially true if vmax(D) = ∞. Therefore, assume
that vmax(D) < ∞. Then, because of the deﬁnition of vmax(D), the system
(12.3-A) has no solution when α = vmax(D). So neither of the two systems in
(12.3) has a solution for α = vmax(D). Thus, the system (12.2) has a solution
for this α-value by the lemma, which means that there is a feasible point ˆx
such that ⟨c, ˆx⟩≤vmax(D). Consequently, vmin(P) ≤⟨c, ˆx⟩≤vmax(D).
Note that it follows from the proof that the minimization problem actually
has an optimal solution ˆx.
Case 2. Y = ∅and the system (12.3-B) has no solution.
The system (12.3-A) now lacks solutions for all values of α, so it follows
from the lemma that the system (12.2) is solvable for all α-values, and this
means that the objective function ⟨c, x⟩is unbounded below on X. Hence,
vmin(P) = −∞= vmax(D) in this case.
Case 3. The system (12.3-B) has a solution
It now follows from the lemma that the system (12.2) has no solution for all
values of α, and this implies that the set X of feasible solutions is empty.
The polyhedron Y of feasible points in the dual problem is consequently
nonempty. Choose a point y0 ∈Y , let y be a solution to the system (12.3-B)
and consider the points yt = y0 + ty for t > 0. The vectors yt belong to V ,
because they are conical combinations of vectors in V . Moreover, the vectors
c−ATyt = (c−ATy0)−tATy are conic combinations of vectors in U and thus
belong to U. This means that the vector yt lies in Y for t > 0, and since
⟨b, yt⟩= ⟨b, y0⟩+ t⟨b, y⟩= ⟨b, y0⟩+ t →+∞
as t →∞, we conclude that vmax(D) = ∞. The inequality (12.4) is in other
words trivially fulﬁlled.
The Complementary Theorem
Theorem 12.2.4 (Complementary theorem). Suppose that ˆx is a feasible point
for the LP problem (P) and that ˆy is a feasible point for the dual LP problem
(D). Then, the two points are optimal for their respective problems if and
only if
⟨c −ATˆy, ˆx⟩= ⟨Aˆx −b, ˆy⟩= 0.
Proof. Note ﬁrst that due to the deﬁnition of the polyhedra X and Y of
feasible points, we have ⟨Ax−b, y⟩≥0 for all points x ∈X and y ∈V , while
⟨c −ATy, x⟩≥0 for all points y ∈Y and x ∈U.

In particular, ⟨Aˆx −b, ˆy⟩≥0 and ⟨c −ATˆy, ˆx⟩≥0 if ˆx is an optimal
solution to the primal problem (P) and ˆy is an optimal solution to the dual
problem (D). Moreover, ⟨c, ˆx⟩= ⟨b, ˆy⟩because of the Duality theorem, so it
follows that
⟨c, ˆx⟩−⟨Aˆx−b, ˆy⟩≤⟨c, ˆx⟩= ⟨b, ˆy⟩≤⟨b, ˆy⟩+⟨c−ATˆy, ˆx⟩= ⟨c, ˆx⟩−⟨Aˆx−b, ˆy⟩.
Since the two extreme ends of this inequality are equal, we have equality
everywhere, i.e. ⟨Aˆx −b, ˆy⟩= ⟨c −ATˆy, ˆx⟩= 0.
Conversely, if ⟨c −ATˆy, ˆx⟩= ⟨Aˆx −b, ˆy⟩= 0, then ⟨c, ˆx⟩= ⟨ATˆy, ˆx⟩and
⟨b, ˆy⟩= ⟨Aˆx, ˆy⟩, and since ⟨ATˆy, ˆx⟩= ⟨Aˆx, ˆy⟩, we conclude that ⟨c, ˆx⟩=
⟨b, ˆy⟩. The optimality of the two points now follows from the Optimality
criterion.
Let us for clarity formulate the Complementarity theorem in the impor-
tant special case when the primal and dual problems have the form described
as Case 2 in Example 12.2.1.
Corollary 12.2.5. Suppose that ˆx and ˆy are feasible points for the dual prob-
lems
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≥b, x ≥0
(P2)
and
max ⟨b, y⟩

(D2)
respectively. Then, they are optimal solutions if and only if
(12.5)

(Aˆx)i > bi
⇒
ˆyi = 0
ˆxj > 0 ⇒(ATˆy)j = cj
In words we can express condition (12.5) as follows, which explains the term
’complementary slackness’: If ˆx satisﬁes an individual inequality in the sys-
tem Ax ≥b strictly, then the corresponding dual variable ˆyi has to be equal
to zero, and if ˆy satisﬁes an individual inequality in the system ATy ≤c
strictly, then the corresponding primal variable xj has to be equal to zero.
Proof. Since ⟨Aˆx−b, ˆy⟩= m
i=1((Aˆx)i −bi)ˆyi is a sum of nonnegative terms,
we have ⟨Aˆx −b, ˆy⟩= 0 if and only if all the terms are equal to zero, i.e. if
and only if (Aˆx)i > bi ⇒ˆyi = 0.
Similarly, ⟨c −ATˆy, ˆx⟩= 0 if and only if ˆxj > 0 ⇒(ATˆy)j = cj. The
corollary is thus just a reformulation of Theorem 12.2.4 for dual problems of
type (P2)–(D2).

The curious reader may wonder whether the implications in the condition
(12.5) can be replaced by equivalences. The following trivial example shows
that this is not the case.
Example 12.2.4. Consider the dual problems
min x1 + 2x2
s.t.
x1 + 2x2 ≥2, x ≥0
and
max 2y
s.t.
 y ≤1
2y ≤2, y ≥0

and b = [2]. The condition (12.5) is not fulﬁlled with
equivalence at the optimal points ˆx = (2, 0) and ˆy = 1, because ˆx2 = 0 and
(ATˆy)2 = 2 = c2.
However, there are other optimal solutions to the minimization problem;
all points on the line segment between (2, 0) and (0, 1) are optimal, and the
optimal pairs ˆx = (2 −2t, t) and ˆy = 1 satisfy the condition (12.5) with
equivalence for 0 < t < 1.
The last conclusion in the above example can be generalized. All dual
problems with feasible points have a pair of optimal solutions ˆx and ˆy that
satisfy the condition (12.5) with implications replaced by equivalences. See
exercise 12.8.

The simplex algorithm
Chapter 13
The simplex algorithm
For practical purposes, there are somewhat simpliﬁed two kinds of methods
for solving LP problems. Both generate a sequence of points with progres-
sively better objective function values. Simplex methods, which were intro-
duced by Dantzig in the late 1940s, generate a sequence of extreme points of
the polyhedron of feasible points in the primal (or dual) problem by moving
along the edges of the polyhedron. Interior-point methods generate instead,
as the name implies, points in the interior of the polyhedron. These methods
are derived from techniques for non-linear programming, developed by Fiacco
and McCormick in the 1960s, but it was only after Karmarkars innovative
analysis in 1984 that the methods began to be used for LP problems.
In this chapter, we describe and analyze the simplex algorithm.
13.1
Standard form
The simplex algorithm requires that the LP problem is formulated in a special
way, and the variant of the algorithm that we will study assumes that the
problem is a minimization problem, that all variables are nonnegative and
that all other constraints are formulated as equalities.
Deﬁnition. An LP problem has standard form if it has the form
min c1x1 + c2x2 + · · · + cnxn
s.t.

we get the following compact writing for an LP problem in standard form:
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0.
We noted in Chapter 9 that each LP problem can be transformed into an
equivalent LP problem in standard form by using slack/surplus variables and
by replacing unrestricted variables with diﬀerences of nonnegative variables.
Duality
We gave a general deﬁnition of the concept of duality in Chapter 12.2 and
showed that dual LP problems have the same optimal value, except when
both problems have no feasible points. In our description of the simplex
algorithm, we will need a special case of duality, and to make the presenta-
tion independent of the results in the previous chapter, we now repeat the
deﬁnition for this special case.
Deﬁnition. The LP problem
(D)
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t. ATy ≤c
is said to be dual to the LP problem
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0.
We shall use the following trivial part of the Duality theorem.
Theorem 13.1.1 (Weak duality). If x is a feasible point for the minimization
problem (P) and y is a feasible point for the dual maximization problem (D),
i.e. if Ax = b, x ≥0 and ATy ≤c, then
⟨b, y⟩≤⟨c, x⟩.
Proof. The inequalities ATy ≤c and x ≥0 imply that att ⟨x, ATy⟩≤⟨x, c⟩,
and hence
⟨b, y⟩= ⟨Ax, y⟩= ⟨x, ATy⟩≤⟨x, c⟩= ⟨c, x⟩.

Corollary 13.1.2 (Optimality criterion). Suppose that ˆx is a feasible point for
the minimization problem (P), that ˆy is a feasible point for the dual maxi-
mization problem (D), and that ⟨c, ˆx⟩= ⟨b, ˆy⟩. Then ˆx and ˆy are optimal
solutions to the respective problems.
Proof. It follows from the assumptions and Theorem 13.1.1, applied to the
point y and an arbitrary feasible point x for the minimization problem, that
⟨c, x⟩= ⟨b, y⟩≤⟨c, x⟩
for all feasible points x.
This shows that x is a minimum point, and an
analogous argument shows that y is a maximum point.
13.2
Informal description of the simplex al-
gorithm
In this section we describe the main features of the simplex algorithm with
the help of some simple examples. The precise formulation of the algorithm
and the proof that it works is given in sections 13.4 and 13.5.

The simplex algorithm
Example 13.2.1. We start with a completely trivial problem, namely
min f(x) = x3 + 2x4
s.t.
x1
+ 2x3 −x4 = 2
x2 −x3 + x4 = 3, x ≥0.
Since the coeﬃcients of the objective function f(x) are positive and x ≥0, it
is clear that f(x) ≥0 for all feasible points x. There is also a feasible point
x with x3 = x4 = 0, namely x = (2, 3, 0, 0). The minimum is therefore equal
to 0, and (2, 3, 0, 0) is the (unique) minimum point.
Now consider an arbitrary problem of the form
(13.1)
min f(x) = cm+1xm+1 + · · · + cnxn + d
s.t.









x1 + a1 m+1xm+1 + . . . + a1nxn = b1
x2 + a2 m+1xm+1 + . . . + a2nxn = b2
...
xm + am m+1xm+1 + . . . + amnxn = bm, x ≥0
where
b1, b2, . . . , bm ≥0.
If cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn ≥0, then obviously f(x) ≥d for all feasible points x,
and since x = (b1, . . . , bm, 0, . . . , 0) is a feasible point and f(x) = d, it follows
that d is the optimal value.
The constraint system in LP problem (13.1) has a very special form, for it
is solved with respect to the basic variables x1, x2, . . . , xm, and these variables
are not present in the objective function. Quite generally, we shall call a set
of variables basic to a given system of linear equations if it is possible to solve
the system with respect to the variables in the set.
Example 13.2.2. Let us alter the objective function in Example 13.2.1 by
changing the sign of the x3-coeﬃcient. Our new problem thus reads as fol-
lows:
(13.2)
min f(x) = −x3 + 2x4
s.t.
x1
+ 2x3 −x4 = 2
x2 −x3 + x4 = 3, x ≥0.
The point (2, 3, 0, 0) is of course still feasible and the corresponding value
of the objective function is 0, but we can get a smaller value by choosing
x3 > 0 and keeping x4 = 0.
However, we must ensure that x1 ≥0 and

The simplex algorithm
x2 ≥0, so the ﬁrst constraint equation yields the bound x1 = 2 −2x3 ≥0,
i.e. x3 ≤1.
We now transform the problem by solving the system (13.2) with respect
to the variables x2 and x3, i.e. by changing basic variables from x1, x2 to
x2, x3. Using Gaussian elimination, we obtain

2x1
+ x3 −1
2x4 = 1
1
2x1 + x2
+ 1
2x4 = 4.
The new basic variable x3 is then eliminated from the objectiv function by
using the ﬁrst equation in the new system. This results in
f(x) = 1
2x1 + 3
2x4 −1,
and our problem has thus been reduced to a problem of the form (13.1),
namely
min

2x1 + 3

s.t.

1
2x1
+ x3 −1
2x4 = 1
1
2x1 + x2
+ 1
2x4 = 4, x ≥0
with x2 and x3 as basic variables and with nonnegative coeﬃcients for the
other variables in the objectiv function. Hence, the optimal value is equal to
−1, and (0, 4, 1, 0) is the optimal point.
The strategy for solving a problem of the form (13.1), where some co-
eﬃcient cm+k is negative, consists in replacing one of the basic variables
x1, x2, . . . , xm with xm+k so as to obtain a new problem of the same form. If
the new c-coeﬃcients are nonnegative, then we are done. If not, we have to
repeat the procedure. We illustrate with another example.
Example 13.2.3. Consider the problem
(13.3)
min f(x) = 2x1 −x2 + x3 −3x4 + x5
s.t.



x1

x3 −x4 + x5 = 3, x ≥0.
First we have to eliminate the basic variables x1, x2, x3 from the objective
function with
(13.4)
f(x) = −5x4 + 5x5 + 9
as result. Since the coeﬃcient of x4 is negative, x4 has to be eliminated
from the objective function and from two constraint equations in such a way

that the right hand side of the transformed system remains nonnegative.
The third equation in (13.3) can not be used for this elimination, since the
coeﬃcient of x4 is negative. Eliminating x4 from the ﬁrst equation by using
the second equation results in the equation x1 −2x2 −7x5 = 5 −2 · 4 = −3,
which has an illegal right-hand side. It therefore only remains to use the ﬁrst
of the constraints in (13.3) for the elimination. We then get the following
equivalent system

with x2, x3, x4 as new basic variables.
The reason why the right-hand side of the system remains positive when
the ﬁrst equation of (13.3) is used for the elimination of x4, is that the ratio
of the right-hand side and the x4-coeﬃcient is smaller for the ﬁrst equation
than for the second (5/2 < 4/1).
We now eliminate x4 from the objective function, using equation (13.4)
and the ﬁrst equation of the system (13.5), and obtain
f(x) = 5

which is to be minimized under the constraints (13.5). The minimum value
is clearly equal to −7
2, and (0, 3
2, 11
2 , 5
2, 0) is the minimum point.
To reduce the writing it is customary to omit the variables and only work
with coeﬃcients in tabular form. The problem (13.3) is thus represented by
the following simplex tableau:

The upper part of the tableau represents the system of equations, and the
lower row represents the objective function f. The vertical line corresponds
to the equality signs in (13.3).
To eliminate the basic variables x1, x2, x3 from the objective function we
just have to add −2 times row 1, row 2 and −1 times row 3 to the objective
function row in the above tableau. This gives us the new tableau

The bottom row corresponds to equation (13.4). Note that the constant term
9 appears on the other side of the equality sign compared to (13.4), and this
explains the minus sign in the tableau. We have also highlighted the basic
variables by underscoring.
Since the x4-coeﬃcient of the objective function is negative, we have to
transform the tableau in such a way that x4 becomes a new basic variable.
By comparing the ratios 5/2 and 4/1 we conclude that the ﬁrst row has to
be the pivot row, i.e. has to be used for the eliminations. We have indicated
this by underscoring the coeﬃcient in the ﬁrst row and the fourth column of
the tableau, the so-called pivot element.
Gaussian elimination gives rise to the new simplex tableau

The simplex algorithm
The minimum point is obtained by assigning the value 0 to the non-basic
variables x1 and x5, which gives x = (0, 3
2, 11
2 , 5

Example 13.2.4. Let us solve the LP problem

with x4, x5, x6 as basic variables, and these are already eliminated from the
objective function. Since the x2-coeﬃcient of the objective function is nega-
tive, we have to introduce x2 as a new basic variable, and we have to use the
underscored element as pivot element, since 1/1 < 5/2. Using the third row,
the tableau is transformed into

Since the x3-coeﬃcient in the objective function is now negative, we have
to repeat the procedure. We must thus introduce x3 as a new basic variable,
and this time we have to use the ﬁrst row as pivot row, for 3/6 < 2/1. The
new tableau has the following form

The simplex algorithm
We can now read oﬀthe minimum −7
2 and the minimum point (0, 2, 1
2, 0, 3
2, 0).
So far, we have written the function symbol f in the lower right corner of
our simplex tableaux. We have done this for pedagogical reasons to explain
why the function value in the box gets a reverse sign. Remember that the
last row of the previous simplex tableau means that
3
2x1 + 1
2x4 + x6 = f(x) + 7
2.
Since the symbol has no other function, we will omit it in the future.
Example 13.2.5. The problem
min f(x) = −2x1 + x2
s.t.

x1 −x2 + x3
= 3
−x1 + x2
+ x4 = 4, x ≥0

Since the objective function has a negative x2-coeﬃcient, we are now
supposed to introduce x2 as a basic variable, but no row will work as a
pivot row since the entire x2-column is non-positive. This implies that the
objective function is unbounded below, i.e. there is no minimum. To see this,
we rewrite the last tableau with variables in the form
min f(x) = −x2 + 2x3 −6
s.t.
x1 = x2 −x3 + 3
x4 =
−x3 + 7.
By choosing x2 = t and x3 = 0 we get a feasible point xt = (3 + t, t, 0, 7) for
each t ≥0, and since f(xt) = −t −6 →−∞as t →∞, we conclude that the
objective function is unbounded below.
Examples 13.2.4 and 13.2.5 are typical for LP problems of the form (13.1).
In Section 13.5, namely, we show that one can always perform the iterations

so as to obtain a ﬁnal tableau similar to the one in Example 13.2.4 or the one
in Example 13.2.5, and in Section 13.6 we will show how to get started, i.e.
how to transform an arbitrary LP problem in standard form into a problem
of the form (13.1).
13.3
Basic solutions
In order to describe and understand the simplex algorithm it is necessary
ﬁrst to know how to produce solutions to a linear system of equations. We
assume that Gaussian elimination is familiar and concentrate on describing
how to switch from one basic solution to another. We begin by reviewing the
notation that we will use in the rest of this chapter.
The columns of an m × n-matrix A will be denoted A∗1, A∗2, . . . , A∗n so
that
A =

A∗1 A∗2 . . . A∗n

.
We will often have to consider submatrices comprised of certain columns
in an m × n-matrix A. So if 1 ≤k ≤n and
α = (α1, α2, . . . , αk)

The simplex algorithm
is a permutation of k elements chosen from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, we let A∗α
denote the m × k-matrix consisting of the columns A∗α1, A∗α2, . . . , A∗αk in
the matrix A, i.e.
A∗α =

A∗α1 A∗α2 . . . A∗αk

.
And if
x =


is a column matrix with n entries, then xα denotes the column matrix


xα1
xα2...
xαk

.
As usual, we make no distinction between column matrices with n entries
and vectors in Rn.
We consider permutations α = (α1, α2, . . . , αk) as ordered sets and allow
us therefore to write j ∈α if j is any of the numbers α1, α2, . . . , αk. This
also allows us to write sums of the type
k

i=1
xαiA∗αi
as

j∈α
xjA∗j,
or with matrices as
A∗αxα.
Deﬁnition. Let A be an m×n-matrix of rank m, and let α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm)
be a permutation of m numbers from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. The permutation
α is called a basic index set of the matrix A if the columns of the m×m-matrix
A∗α form a basis for Rm.
The condition that the columns A∗α1, A∗α2, . . . , A∗αm form a basis is equiv-
alent to the condition that the submatrix
A∗α =

A∗α1 A∗α2 . . . A∗αm

is invertible. The inverse of the matrix A∗α will be denoted by A−1
∗α. This
matrix, which thus means (A∗α)−1, will appear frequently in the sequel −do
not confuse it with (A−1)∗α, which is not generally well deﬁned.
If α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) is a basic index set, so too is of course every
permutation of α.
Example 13.3.1. The matrix
3

has the following basic index sets: (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1)
(2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2).
We also need a convenient way to show the result of replacing an element
in an ordered set with some other element. Therefore, let M = (a1, a2, . . . , an)
be an arbitrary n-tuple (ordered set). The n-tuple obtained by replacing the
item ar at location r with an arbitrary object x will be denoted by Mˆr[x]. In
other words,
Mˆr[x] = (a1, . . . , ar−1, x, ar+1, . . . , an).
An m × n-matrix can be regarded as an ordered set of columns. If b is
a column matrix with m entries and 1 ≤r ≤n, we therefore write Aˆr[b] for
the matrix

A∗1 . . . A∗r−1 b A∗r+1 . . . A∗n

.
Another context in which we will use the above notation for replacement
of elements, is when α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) is a permutation of m elements
taken from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. If 1 ≤r ≤m, 1 ≤k ≤n and k /∈α, then
αˆr[k] denotes the new permutation
(α1, . . . , αr−1, k, αr+1, . . . , αm).
Later we will need the following simple result, where the above notation
is used.
Lemma 13.3.1. Let E be the unit matrix of order m, and let b be a column
matrix with m elements. The matrix Eˆr[b] is invertible if and only if br ̸= 0,
and in this case
Eˆr[b]−1 = Eˆr[c],
where

The simplex algorithm
or as a matrix equation
(13.6′′)
Ax = b.
Both alternative approaches are, as we shall see, fruitful.
We solve the system (13.6), preferably using Gaussian elimination, by
expressing m of the variables, xα1, xα2, . . . , xαm say, as linear combinations
of the remaining n −m variables xβ1, xβ2, . . . , xβn−m and b1, b2, . . . , bm. Each
assignment of values to the latter β-variables results in a unique set of values
for the former α-variables. In particular, we get a unique solution by setting
all β-variables equal to 0.
This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition. Let α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) be a permutation of m numbers chosen
from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, and let β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn−m) be a permutation
of the remaining n −m numbers. The variables xα1, xα2, . . . , xαm are called
basic variables and the variables xβ1, xβ2, . . . , xβn−m are called free variables
in the system (13.6), if for each c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn−m) ∈Rn−m there is a
unique solution x to the system (13.6) such that xβ = c. The unique solution
obtained by setting all free variables equal to 0 is called a basic solution.
Any m variables can not be chosen as basic variables; to examine which
ones can be selected, let α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) be a permutation of m numbers
from the set {1, 2, . . . , n} and let β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn−m) be an arbitrary
permutation of the remaining n −m numbers, and rewrite equation (13.6′)
as
(13.6′′′)
m

j=1
xαjA∗αj = b −
n−m

j=1
xβjA∗βj.
If α is a basic index set, i.e. if the columns A∗α1, A∗α2, . . . , A∗αm form a
basis of Rm, then equation (13.6′′′) has clearly a unique solution for each
assignment of values to the β-variables, and (xα1, xα2, . . . , xαm) is in fact the
coordinates of the vector b −n−m
j=1 xβjA∗βj in this basis. In particular, the
coordinates of the vector b are equal to (xα1, xα2, . . . , xαm), where x is the
corresponding basic solution, deﬁned by the condition that xβj = 0 for all j.
Conversely, suppose that each assignment of values to the β-variables
determines uniquely the values of the α-variables. In particular, the equation

j=1
xαjA∗αj = b

The simplex algorithm
has then a unique solution, and this implies that the equation
(13.8)
m

j=1
xαjA∗αj = 0
has no other solution then the trivial one, xαj = 0 for all j, because we would
otherwise get several solutions to equation (13.7) by to a given one adding
a non-trivial solution to equation (13.8). The columns A∗α1, A∗α2, . . . , A∗αm
are in other words linearly independent, and they form a basis for Rm since
they are m in number. Hence, α is a basic index set.
In summary, we have proved the following result.
Theorem 13.3.2. The variables xα1, xα2, . . . , xαm are basic variables in the
system (13.6) if and only if α is a basic index set of the coeﬃcient matrix A.
Let us now express the basic solution corresponding to the basic index
set α in matrix form. By writing the matrix equation (13.6′′) in the form
A∗αxα + A∗βxβ = b
and multiplying from the left by the matrix A−1
∗α, we get
xα + A−1
∗αA∗βxβ = A−1
∗αb,
i.e.
xα = A−1
∗αb −A−1
∗αA∗βxβ,
which expresses the basic variables as linear combinations of the free variables
and the coordinates of b. The basic solution is obtained by setting xβ = 0
and is given by
xα = A−1
∗αb , xβ = 0.
We summarize this result in the following theorem.
Theorem 13.3.3. Let α be a basic index set of the matrix A. The corre-
sponding basic solution x to the system Ax = b is given by the conditions
xα = A−1
∗αb
and
xk = 0
for k /∈α.
The n−m free variables in a basic solution are equal to zero by deﬁnition.
Of course, some basic variable may also happen to be equal to zero, and since
this results in certain complications for the simplex algorithm, we make the
following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition. A basic solution x is called non-degenerate if xi ̸= 0 for m indices
i and degenerate if xi ̸= 0 for less than m indices i.

Two basic index sets α and α′, which are permutations of each other,
naturally give rise to the same basic solution x. So the number of diﬀerent
basic solutions to a system Ax = b with m equations and n unknowns is at
most equal to the number of subsets with m elements that can be chosen
from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, i.e. at most equal to
n
m

. The number is smaller
if the matrix A contains m linearly dependent columns.
Example 13.3.3. The system
3x1 + x2 + x3 −3x4 = 3
3x1 −x2 + 2x3 −6x4 = 3
has −apart from permutations −the following basic index sets: (1, 2), (1, 3),
(1, 4), (2, 3) and (2, 4), and the corresponding basic solutions are in turn
(1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 2, 0) and (0, 1, 0, −2
3). The basic so-
lution (1, 0, 0, 0) is degenerate, and the other two basic solutions are non-
degenerate.
The reason for our interest in basic index sets and basic solutions is that
optimal values of LP problems are attained at extreme points, and these
points are basic solutions, because we have the following characterisation of
extreme points.

The simplex algorithm
Theorem 13.3.4. Suppose that A is an m×n-matrix of rank m, that b ∈Rm
and that c ∈Rn. Then:
(i) x is an extreme point of the polyhedron X = {x ∈Rn | Ax = b, x ≥0}
if and only if x is a nonnegative basic solution to the system Ax = b,
i.e. if and only if there is a basic index set α of the matrix A such that
xα = A−1
∗αb ≥0 and xk = 0 for k /∈α.
(ii) y is an extreme point of the polyhedron Y = {y ∈Rm | ATy ≤c} if and
only if ATy ≤c and there is a basic index set α of the matrix A such
that y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα.
Proof. (i) According to Theorem 5.1.1 in Part I, x is an extreme point of the
polyhedron X if and only if x ≥0 and x is the unique solution of a system
of linear equations consisting of the equation Ax = b and n −m equations
out of the n equations x1 = 0, x2 = 0, . . . , xn = 0. Let α1, α2, . . . , αm be the
indices of the m equations xi = 0 that are not used in this system. Then,
α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) is a basic index set and x is the corresponding basic
solution.
(ii) Because of the same theorem, y is an extreme point of the polyhedron
Y if and only if y ∈Y and y is the unique solution of a quadratic system of
linear equations obtained by selecting m out of the n equations in the system
ATy = c. Let α1, α2, . . . , αm denote the indices of the selected equations.
The quadratic system is then of the form (A∗α)Ty = cα, and this system
of equations has a unique solution y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα if and only if A∗α is an
invertible matrix, i.e. if and only if α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) is a basic index set
of A.
Example 13.3.4. It follows from Theorem 13.3.4 and Example 13.3.3 that
the polyhedron X of solutions to the system
3x1 + x2 + x3 −3x4 = 3
3x1 −x2 + 2x3 −6x4 = 3, x ≥0
has two extreme points, namely (1, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 2, 0).

respectively, are not extreme points since they lie outside Y .)

Changing basic index sets
We will now discuss how to generate a suite of basic solutions by successively
replacing one element at a time in the basic index set.
Theorem 13.3.5. Suppose that α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) is a basic index set of
the system Ax = b and let x denote the corresponding basic solution. Let k
be a column index not belonging to the basic index set α, and let v ∈Rn be
the column vector deﬁned by
vα = A−1
∗αA∗k,
vk = −1
and
vj = 0
for j /∈α ∪{k}.
(i) Then Av = 0, so it follows that x−tv is a solution to the system Ax = b
for all t ∈R.
(ii) Suppose that 1 ≤r ≤m and deﬁne a new ordered set α′ by replacing
the element αr in α with the number k, i.e.
α′ = αˆr[k] = (α1, . . . , αr−1, k, αr+1, . . . , αm).
Then, α′ is a basic index set if and only if vαr ̸= 0. In this case,
A−1
∗α′ = Eˆr[vα]−1A−1
∗α
and if x′ is the basic solution corresponding to the basic index set α′,
then
x′ = x −τv,
where τ = xαr/vαr.
(iii) The two basic solutions x and x′ are identical if and only if τ = 0. So
if x is a non-degenerate basic solution, then x ̸= x′.
We will call v the search vector associated with the basic index set α and
the index k, since we obtain the new basic solution x′ from the old one x by
searching in the direction of minus v.
Proof. (i)
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of v that
Av =

j∈α
vjA∗j +

j /∈α
vjA∗j = A∗αvα −A∗k = A∗k −A∗k = 0.
(ii) The set α′ is a basic index set if and only if A∗α′ is an invertible matrix.

where of course E denotes the unit matrix of order m. Hence
A∗α′ = A∗αEˆr[vα].
The matrix A∗α′ is thus invertible if and only if the matrix Eˆr[vα] is invertible,
and this is the case if and only if vαr ̸= 0, according to Lemma 13.3.1. If the
inverse exists, then
A−1
∗α′ =

A∗αEˆr[vα]
−1 = Eˆr[vα]−1A−1
∗α.
Now, deﬁne xτ = x −τv. Then xτ is a solution to the equation Ax = b,
by part (i) of the theorem, so in order to prove that xτ is the basic solution
corresponding to the basic index set α′, it suﬃces to show that xτ
j = 0 for all
j /∈α′, i.e. for j = αr and for j /∈α ∪{k}.
But xτ
αr = xαr −τvαr = 0, because of the deﬁnition of τ, and if j /∈α∪{k}
then xj and vj are both equal to 0, whence xτ
j = xj −τvj = 0.
(iii) Since vk = −1, we have τv = 0 if and only if τ = 0. Hence , x′ = x if
and only if τ = 0.
If the basic solution x is non-degenerate, then xj ̸= 0 for all j ∈α and in
particular xαr ̸= 0, which implies that τ ̸= 0, and that x′ ̸= x.

The simplex algorithm
Corollary
13.3.6. Keep the asumptions of Theorem 13.3.5 and suppose in
addition that x ≥0, that the index set
I+ = {j ∈α | vj > 0}
is nonempty, and that the index r is chosen so that αr ∈I+ and
τ = xαr/vαr = min{xj/vj | j ∈I+}.
Then x′ ≥0.
Proof. Since x′
j = 0 for all j /∈α′, it suﬃces to show that x′
j ≥0 for all
j ∈α ∪{k}.
We begin by noting that τ ≥0 since x ≥0, and therefore
x′
k = xk −τvk = 0 + τ ≥0.
For indices j ∈α \ I+ we have vj ≤0, and this implies that
x′
j = xj −τvj ≥xj ≥0.
Finally, if j ∈I+, then xj/vj ≥τ, and it follows that
x′
j = xj −τvj ≥0.
This completes the proof.
13.4
The simplex algorithm
The variant of the simplex algorithm that we shall describe assumes that the
LP problem is given in standard form. So we start from the problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
where A is an m × n-matrix, b ∈Rm and c ∈Rn.
We assume that
rank A = m = the number of rows in A.
Of course, this is no serious restriction, because if rank A < m and the system
Ax = b is consistent, then we can delete (m −rank A) constraint equations
without changing the set of solutions, and this leaves us with an equivalent
system A′x = b, where the rank of A′ is equal to the number of rows in A′.
Let us call a basic index set α of the matrix A and the corresponding
basic solution x to the system Ax = b feasible, if x is a feasible point for our
standard problem, i.e. if x ≥0.

The simplex algorithm
The simplex algorithm starts from a feasible basic index set α of the
matrix A, and we shall show in Section 13.6 how to ﬁnd such an index set
by applying the simplex algorithm to a so-called artiﬁcial problem.
First compute the corresponding feasible basic solution x, i.e.
xα = A−1
∗αb ≥0,
and then the number λ ∈R and the column vectors y ∈Rm and z ∈Rn,
deﬁned as
λ = ⟨c, x⟩= ⟨cα, xα⟩
y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα
z = c −ATy.
The number λ is thus equal to the value of the objective function at x.
Note that zα = cα −(ATy)α∗= cα −(A∗α)Ty = cα −cα = 0, so in order
to compute the vector z we only have to compute its coordinates
zj = cj −(A∗j)Ty = cj −⟨A∗j, y⟩
for indices j /∈α. The numbers zj are usually called reduced costs.
Lemma 13.4.1. The number λ and the vectors x, y and z have the following
properties:
(i) ⟨z, x⟩= 0, i.e. the vectors z and x are orthogonal.
(ii) Ax = 0 ⇒⟨c, x⟩= ⟨z, x⟩.
(iii) Ax = b ⇒⟨c, x⟩= λ + ⟨z, x⟩.
(iv) If v is the search vector corresponding to the basic index set α and the
index k /∈α, then ⟨c, x −tv⟩= λ + tzk.
Proof. (i) Since zj = 0 for j ∈α and xj = 0 for j /∈α,
⟨z, x⟩=

j∈α
zjxj +

j /∈α
zjxj = 0 + 0 = 0.
(ii) It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of z that
⟨z, x⟩= ⟨c, x⟩−⟨ATy, x⟩= ⟨c, x⟩−⟨y, Ax⟩= ⟨c, x⟩
for all x satisfying the equation Ax = 0.
(iii) If Ax = b, then
⟨c, x⟩−⟨z, x⟩= ⟨ATy, x⟩= ⟨y, Ax⟩= ⟨(A−1
∗α)Tcα, b⟩= ⟨cα, A−1
∗αb⟩
= ⟨cα, xα⟩= λ.
(iv) Since Av = 0, it follows from (ii) that
⟨c, x −tv⟩= ⟨c, x⟩−t⟨c, v⟩= λ −t⟨z, v⟩= λ + tzk.

The simplex algorithm
The following theorem contains all the essential ingredients of the simplex
algorithm.
Theorem 13.4.2. Let α, x, λ, y and z be deﬁned as above.
(i) (Optimality) If z ≥0, then x is an optimal solution to the minimiza-
tion problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
and y is an optimal solution to the dual maximization problem
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c
with λ as the optimal value. The optimal solution x to the minimization
problem is unique if zj > 0 for all j /∈α.
(ii) Suppose that z ̸≥0, and let k be an index such that zk < 0. Let further
v be the search vector associated to α and k, i.e.
vα = A−1
∗αA∗k,
vk = −1,
vj = 0
for j /∈α ∪{k},
and set xt = x −tv for t ≥0. Depending on whether v ≤0 or v ̸≤0,
the following applies:
(ii a) (Unbounded objective function) If v ≤0, then the points
xt are feasible for the minimization problem for all t ≥0 and
⟨c, xt⟩→−∞as t →∞. The objective function is thus unbounded
below, and the dual maximization problem has no feasible points.
(ii b) (Iteration step) If v ̸≤0, then deﬁne a new basic index set
α′ and the number τ as in Theorem 13.3.5 (ii) with the index r
chosen as in Corollary 13.3.6. The basic index set α′ is feasible
with x′ = x −τv as the corresponding feasible basic solution, and
⟨c, x′⟩= ⟨c, x⟩+ τzk ≤⟨c, x⟩.
Hence, ⟨c, x′⟩< ⟨c, x⟩, if τ > 0.
Proof. (i) Suppose that z ≥0 and that x is an arbitrary feasible point for
the minimization problem. Then ⟨z, x⟩≥0 (since x ≥0), and it follows
from part (iii) of Lemma 13.4.1 that ⟨c, x⟩≥λ = ⟨c, x⟩. The point x is thus
optimal and the optimal value is equal to λ.
The condition z ≥0 also implies that ATy = c −z ≤c, i.e. y is a feasible
point for the dual maximization problem, and
⟨b, y⟩= ⟨y, b⟩= ⟨(A−1
∗α)Tcα, b⟩= ⟨cα, A−1
∗αb⟩= ⟨cα, xα⟩= ⟨c, x⟩,
so if follows from the optimality criterion (Corollary 13.1.2) that y is an
optimal solution to the dual problem.

Now suppose that zj > 0 for all j /∈α. If x is a feasible point ̸= x, then
xj0 > 0 for some index j0 /∈α, and it follows that ⟨z, x⟩= 
j /∈α zjxj ≥
zj0xj0 > 0. Hence, ⟨c, x⟩= λ + ⟨z, x⟩> λ = ⟨c, x⟩, by Lemma 13.4.1 (iii).
This proves that the minimum point is unique.
(ii a) According to Theorem 13.3.5, xt is a solution to the equation Ax = b
for all real numbers t, and if v ≤0 then xt = x −tv ≥x ≥0 for t ≥0. So
the points xt are feasible for all t ≥0 if v ≤0, and by Lemma 13.4.1 (iv),
lim
t→∞⟨c, xt⟩= λ + lim
t→∞zkt = −∞.
The objective function is thus not bounded below.
Suppose that the dual maximization problem has a feasible point y. Then,
⟨b, y⟩≤⟨c, xt⟩for all t ≥0, by the weak duality theorem, and this is contra-
dictory since the right hand side tends to −∞as t →∞. So it follows that
the dual maximization problem has no feasible points.
(ii b) By Corollary 13.3.6, α′ is a feasible basic solution with xτ as the cor-
responding basic solution, and the inequality ⟨c, x′⟩≤⟨c, x⟩now follows
directly from Lemma 13.4.1 (iv), because τ ≥0.

The simplex algorithm
Theorem 13.4.2 gives rise to the following algorithm for solving the stan-
dard problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0.
The simplex algorithm
Given a feasible basic index set α.
1. Compute the matrix A−1
∗α, the corresponding feasible basic solution x,
i.e. xα = A−1
∗αb and xj = 0 for j /∈α, and the number λ = ⟨cα, xα⟩.
Repeat steps 2–8 until a stop occurs.
2. Compute the vector y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα and the numbers zj = cj −⟨A∗j, y⟩
for j /∈α.
3. Stopping criterion: quit if zj ≥0 for all j /∈α.
Optimal solution: x. Optimal value: λ. Optimal dual solution: y.
4. Choose otherwise an index k such that zk < 0, compute the corre-
sponding search vector v, i.e. vα = A−1
∗αA∗k, vk = −1 and vj = 0 for
j /∈α ∪{k}, and put I+ = {j ∈α | vj > 0}.
5. Stopping criterion: quit if I+ = ∅.
Optimal value: −∞.
6. Deﬁne otherwise τ = min{xj/vj | j ∈I+} and determine an index r so
that αr ∈I+ and xαr/vαr = τ.
7. Put α′ = αˆr[k] and compute the inverse A−1
∗α′ = Eˆr[vα]−1A−1
∗α.
8. Update: α:= α′, A−1
∗α := A−1
∗α′, x:= x −τv, and λ:= λ + τzk.
Before we can call the above procedure an algorithm in the sense of a
mechanical calculation that a machine can perform, we need to specify how
to choose k in step 4 in the case when zj < 0 for several indices j, and r in
step 6 when xj/vj = τ for more than one index j ∈I+.
A simple rule that works well most of the time, is to select the index j
that minimizes zj (and if there are several such indices the least of these) as
the index k, and the smallest of all indices i for which xαi/vαi = τ as the
index r. We shall return to the choice of k and r later; for the immediate
discussion of the algorithm, it does not matter how to make the choice.
We also need a method to ﬁnd an initial feasible basic index set to start
the simplex algorithm from.
We shall treat this problem and solve it in
Section 13.6.
Now suppose that we apply the simplex algorithm to an LP problem
in standard form, starting from a feasible basic index set. It follows from
Theorem 13.4.2 that the algorithm delivers an optimal solution if it stops

The simplex algorithm
during step 3, and that the objective function is unbounded from below if
the algorithm stops during step 5.
So let us examine what happens if the algorithm does not stop. Since
a feasible basic index set is generated each time the algorithm comes to
step 7, we will obtain in this case an inﬁnite sequence α1, α2, α3, . . . of feasible
basic index sets with associated feasible basic solutions x1, x2, x3, . . .. As the
number of diﬀerent basic index sets is ﬁnite, some index set αp has to be
repeated after a number of additional, say q, iterations. This means that αp =
αp+q and xp = xp+q and in turn implies that the sequence αp, αp+1, . . . , αp+q−1
is repeated periodically in all inﬁnity. We express this by saying that the
algorithm cycles. According to (ii)
¯
in Theorem 13.4.2,
⟨c, xp⟩≥⟨c, xp+1⟩≥· · · ≥⟨c, xp+q⟩= ⟨c, xp⟩,
and this implies that
⟨c, xp⟩= ⟨c, xp+1⟩= · · · = ⟨c, xp+q−1⟩.
The number τ is hence equal to 0 for all the iterations of the cycle, and
this implies that the basic solutions xp, xp+1, . . . , xp+q−1 are identical and
degenerate. If the simplex algorithm does not stop, but continues indeﬁnitely,
it is so because the algortihm has got stuck in a degenerate basic solution.
The following theorem is now an immediate consequence of the above
discussion.
Theorem 13.4.3. The simplex algorithm stops when applied to an LP prob-
lem in which all feasible basic solutions are non-degenerate.
Cycling can occur, and we shall give an example of this in the next sec-
tion. Theoretically, this is a bit troublesome, but cycling seems to be a rare
phenomenon in practical problems and therefore lacks practical signiﬁcance.
The small rounding errors introduced during the numerical treatment of an
LP problem also have a beneﬁcial eﬀect since these errors usually turn de-
generate basic solutions into non-degenerate solutions and thereby tend to
prevent cycling. There is also a simple rule for the choice of indices k and r,
Bland’s rule, which prevents cycling and will be described in the next section.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The solution x = (4, 29
3 , 4
3, 0, 0, 0) is optimal with optimal value −13
3 since
z4,5,6 > 0. The original minimization problem has the same optimal value, of
course, and (x1, x2, x3) = (4, 29
3 , 4
3) is the optimal solution.
The version of the simplex algorithm that we have presented is excellent
for computer calculations, but it is unnecessarily complicated for calculations
by hand.
Then it is better to use the tableau form which we utilized in
Section 13.2, even if this entails performing unnecessary calculations. To the
LP problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
we associate the following simplex tableau:
(13.9)
A

cT

We have included the column on the far right of the table only to explain
how the tableau calculations work; it will be omitted later on.

The simplex algorithm
Let α be a feasible basic index set with x as the corresponding basic
solution. The upper part [ A
b
E ] of the tableau can be seen as a matrix,
and by multiplying this matrix from the left by A−1
∗α, we obtain the following
new tableau:
A−1
∗αA
A−1
∗αb
A−1
∗α
cT
0
0T
Now subtract the upper part of this tableau multiplied from the left by
c T
α from the bottom row of the tableau. This results in the tableau
A−1
∗αA
A−1
∗αb
A−1
∗α
cT −c T
αA−1
∗αA
−c T
αA−1
∗αb
−c T
αA−1
∗α
Using the notation introduced in the deﬁnition of the simplex algorithm,
we have A−1
∗αb = xα, c T
αA−1
∗α = ((A−1
∗α)Tcα)T = yT, cT−c T
αA−1
∗αA = cT−yTA = zT
and c T
αA−1
∗αb = c T
αxα = ⟨cα, xα⟩= λ, which means that the above tableau can
be written in the form
(13.10)
A−1
∗αA
xα
A−1
∗α
zT
−λ
−yT
Note that the columns of the unit matrix appear as columns in the matrix
A−1
∗αA, because column number αj in A−1
∗αA is identical with unit matrix
column E∗j. Moreover, zαj = 0.
When performing the actual calculations, we use Gaussian elimination to
get from tableau (13.9) to tableau (13.10).
If zT ≥0, which we can determine with the help of the bottom line in
(13.10), then x is an optimal solution, and we can also read oﬀthe optimal
solution y to the dual maximization problem. (The matrix A will in many
cases contain the columns of the unit matrix, and if so then it is of course
possible to read oﬀthe solution to the dual problem in the ﬁnal simplex
tableau without ﬁrst having to add the unit matrix on the right side of
tableau (13.9).)
If zT ̸≥0, then we choose a column index k with zk < 0, and consider the
corresponding column a = A−1
∗αA∗k (= vα) in the upper part of the tableau.
The minimization problem is unbounded if a ≤0. In the opposite case,
we choose an index i = r that minimizes xαi/ai (= xαi/vαi) among all ratios
with positive ai. This means that r is the index of a row with the least ratio
xαi/ai among all rows with positive ai. Finally, we transform the simplex
tableau by pivoting around the element at location (r, k).

and in this case it is of course not necessary to repeat the columns of the
unit matrix in a separate part of the tableau in order also to solve the dual
problem.
The basic index set α = (4, 5, 6) is feasible, and since A∗α = E and c T
α =

and −λ = 0
from the bottom line of the tableau.
The optimality criterion is not satisﬁed since z2 = −1 < 0, so we proceed
by choosing k = 2. The positive ratios of corresponding elements in the
right-hand side column and the second column are in this case the same and
equal to 3/1 for the ﬁrst and the second row. Therefore, we can choose r = 1
or r = 2, and we decide to use the smaller of the two numbers, i.e. we put
r = 1.
The tableau is then transformed by pivoting around the element at

The optimality criterion is now satisﬁed with x = (4, 29

3, 0, 0, 0) as op-
timal solution and −13
3 as optimal value. The dual problem has the optimal
solution (−1
3, −1, −1
3).
Henceforth, we will use the tableau variant of the simplex algorithm to
account for our calculations, because it is the most transparent method.
The optimality condition in step 2 of the simplex algorithm is a suﬃcient
condition for optimality, but the condition is not necessary. A degenerate
basic solution can be optimal without the optimality condition being satisﬁed.
Here is a trivial example of this.
Example 13.4.3. The problem
min −x2
s.t.
x1 + x2 = 0, x ≥0
has only one feasible point, x = (0, 0), which is therefore optimal. There are
two feasible basic index sets, α = (1) and α′ = (2), both with (0, 0) as the
corresponding degenerate basic solution.

The simplex algorithm
The optimality condition is not fulﬁlled at the basic index set α, because
y = 1 · 0 = 0 and z2 = −1 −1 · 0 = −1 < 0. At the other basic index set α′,
y = 1 · (−1) = −1 and z2 = 0 −1 · (−1) = 1 > 0, and the optimality criterion
is now satisﬁed.
The corresponding simplex tableaux are

α = (1)
and

We shall now study a simple example with a non-unique optimal solution.
Example 13.4.4. The simplex tableaux associated with the problem
min x1 + x2
s.t.
x1 + x2 −x3
= 1
2x2 −x3 + x4 = 1, x ≥0
are as follows:

The optimality condition is met; x = (1, 0, 0, 1) is an optimal solution,
and the optimal value is 1. However, coeﬃcient number 2 in the last row,
i.e. z2, is equal to 0, so we can therefore perform another iteration of the
simplex algorithm by choosing the second column as the pivot column and
the second row as the pivot row, i.e. k = 2 and r = 2. This gives rise to the
following new tableau:

The optimality condition is again met, now with ˆx = ( 1
2, 1
2, 0, 0) as optimal
solution. Since the set of optimal solutions is convex, each point on the line
segment between ˆx and x is also an optimal point.

Bland’s anti cycling rule
We begin with an example of Kuhn showing that cycling can occur in de-
generate LP problems if the column index k and the row index r are not
properly selected.
Example 13.5.1. Consider the problem
min −2x1 −3x2 + x3 + 12x4
s.t.



−2x1 −9x2 + x3 + 9x4 + x5
= 0

3x1 + x2 −1
3x3 −2x4
+ x6
= 0
2x1 + 3x2 −x3 −12x4
+ x7 = 2, x ≥0.
We use the simplex algorithm with the additional rule that the column index
k should be chosen so as to make zk as negative as possible and the row index
r should be the least among all allowed row indices. Our ﬁrst tableau is

choice of of k, we must choose k = 2.
There is only one option for the
row index r, namely r = 2, so we use the element located at (2, 2) as pivot
element and obtain the following new tableau

After six iterations we are back to the starting tableau.
The simplex
algorithm cycles!
We now introduce a rule for the choice of indices k and r that prevents
cycling.
Bland’s rule: Choose k in step 4 of the simplex algorithm so that
k = min{j | zj < 0}
and r in step 6 so that
αr = min{j ∈I+ | xj/vj = τ}.
Example 13.5.2. Consider again the minimization problem in the previous
example and now use the simplex algorithm with Bland’s rule. This results
in the following sequence of tableaux:

The simplex algorithm
Proof. We prove the theorem by contradiction. So suppose that the simplex
algorithm cycles when applied to some given LP problem, and let x be the
common basic solution during the iterations of the cycle.
Let C denote the set of indices k of the varibles xk that change from being
basic to being free during the iterations of the cycle. Since these variables
have to return as basic variables during the cycle, C is of course also equal
to the set of indices of the variables xk that change from being free to being
basic during the cycle. Moreover, xk = 0 for all k ∈C.
Let
q = max{j | j ∈C},
and let α be the basic index set which is in use during the iteration in the
cycle when the variabel xq changes from being basic to being free, and let xk
be the free variable that replaces xq. The index q is in other words replaced
by k in the basic index set that follows after α. The corresponding search
vector v and reduced cost vector z satisfy the inequalities
zk < 0
and
vq > 0,
and
zj ≥0
for j < k.
since the index k is chosen according to Bland’s rule. Since k ∈C, we also
have k < q, because of the deﬁnition of q.
Let us now consider the basic index set α′ that belongs to an iteration
when xq returns as a basic variables after having been free. Because of Bland’s
rule for the choice of incoming index, in this case q, the corresponding reduced
cost vector z′ has to satisfy the following inequalities:
(13.11)
z′
j ≥0
for j < q
and
z′
q < 0.
Especially, thus z′
k ≥0.
Since Av = 0, vk = −1 and vj = 0 for j /∈α ∪{k}, and zj = 0 for j ∈α,
it follows from Lemma 13.4.1 that

j∈α
z′
jvj −z′
k = ⟨z′, v⟩= ⟨c, v⟩= ⟨z, v⟩=

j∈α
zjvj + zkvk = −zk > 0,
and hence

j∈α
z′
jvj > z′
k ≥0.
There is therefore an index j0 ∈α such that z′
j0vj0 > 0. Hence z′
j0 ̸= 0,
which means that j0 can not belong to the index set α′. The variable xj0 is

The simplex algorithm
in other words basic during one iteration of the cycle and free during another
iteration. This means that j0 is an index in the set C, and hence j0 ≤q, by
the deﬁnition of q. The case j0 = q is impossible since vq > 0 and z′
q < 0.
Thus j0 < q, and it now follows from (13.11) that z′
j0 > 0. This implies in
turn that vj0 > 0, because the product z′
j0vj0 is positive. So j0 belongs to the
set I+ = {j ∈α | vj > 0}, and since xj0/vj0 = 0 = τ, it follows that
min{j ∈I+ | xj/vj = τ} ≤j0 < q.
The choice of q thus contradicts Bland’s rule for how to choose index to leave
the basic index set α, and this contradiction proves the theorem.
Remark. It is not necessary to use Bland’s rule all the time in order to prevent
cycling; it suﬃces to use it in iterations with τ = 0.
13.6
Phase 1 of the simplex algorithm
The simplex algorithm assumes that there is a feasible basic index set to start
from. For some problems we will automatically get one when the problem is
written in standard form. This is the case for problems of the type
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≤b, x ≥0
where A is an m × n-matrix and the right-hand side vector b is nonnegative.
By introducing m slack variables sn+1, sn+2, . . . , sn+m and deﬁning
s = (sn+1, sn+2, . . . , sn+m),
we obtain the standard problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax + Es = b, x, s ≥0,
and it is now obvious how to start; the slack variables will do as basic vari-
ables, i.e. α = (n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + m) is a feasible basic index set with
x = 0, s = b as the corresponding basic solution.
In other cases, it is not at all obvious how to ﬁnd a feasible basic index set
to start from, but one can always generate such a set by using the simplex
algorithm on a suitable artiﬁcial problem.
Consider an arbitrary standard LP problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0,

The simplex algorithm

where A is an m × n-matrix. We can assume without restriction that b ≥0,
for if any bj is negative, we just multiply the corresponding equation by −1.
We begin by choosing an m × k-matris B so that the matrix
A′ =

B

gets rank equal to m and the system
A′

y

= Ax + By = b
gets an obvious feasible basic index set α0. The new y-variables are called
artiﬁcial variables, and we number them so that y = (yn+1, yn+2, . . . , yn+k).
A trivial way to achieve this is to choose B equal to the unit matrix E
of order m, for α0 = (n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + m) is then a feasible basic index
set with (x, y) = (0, b) as the corresponding feasible basic solution. Often,
however, A already contains a number of unit matrix columns, and then it
is suﬃcient to add the missing unit matrix columns to A.

The simplex algorithm
be the k × 1-matrix consisting of k ones, and consider the following artiﬁcial
LP problems:
min ⟨1, y⟩= yn+1 + · · · + yn+k
s.t.
Ax + By = b, x, y ≥0
.
The optimal value is obviously ≥0, and the value is equal to zero if and only
if there is a feasible solution of the form (x, 0), i.e. if and only if there is a
nonnegative solution to the system Ax = b.
Therefore, we solve the artiﬁcial problem using the simplex algorithm with
α0 as the ﬁrst feasible basic index set. Since the objective function is bounded
below, the algorithm stops after a ﬁnite number of iterations (perhaps we
need to use Bland’s supplementary rule) in a feasible basic index set α, where
the optimality criterion is satisﬁed. Let (x, y) denote the corresponding basic
solution.
There are now two possibilities.
Case 1. The artiﬁcial problem’s optimal value is greater than zero.
In this case, the original problem has no feasible solutions.
Case 2. The artiﬁcial problem’s value is equal to zero.
In this case, y = 0 and Ax = b.
If α ⊆{1, 2, . . . , n}, then α is also a feasible basic index set of the matrix
A, and we can start the simplex algorithm on our original problem from α
and the corresponding feasible basic solution x.
If α ̸⊆{1, 2, . . . , n}, we set
α′ = α ∩{1, 2, . . . , n}.
The matrix columns {A∗k | k ∈α′} are now linearly independent, and we
can construct an index set β ⊇α′, which is maximal with respect to the
property that the columns {A∗k | k ∈β} are linearly independent.
If rank A = m, then β will consist of m elements, and β is then a basic
index set of the matrix A. Since xj = 0 for all j /∈α′, and thus especially
for all j /∈β, it follows that x is the basic solution of the system Ax = b
that corresponds to the basic index set β. Hence, β is a feasible basic index
set for our original problem. We can also note that x is a degenerate basic
solution.
If rank A < m, then β will consist of just p = rank A elements, but we
can now delete m −p equations from the system Ax = b without changing
the set of solutions. This results in a new equivalent LP problem with a
coeﬃcient matrix of rank p, and β is a feasible basic index set with x as the
corresponding basic solution in this problem.

The simplex algorithm
To solve a typical LP problem, one thus normally needs to use the simplex
algorithm twice. In Phase 1, we use the simplex algorithm to generate a
feasible basic index set α for the original LP problem by solving an artiﬁcial
LP problem, and in phase 2, the simplex algorithm is used to solve the
original problem starting from the basic index set α.
Example 13.6.1. We illustrate the technique on the simple problem
min x1 + 2x2 + x3 −2x4
s.t.



x1 + x2 + x3 −x4 = 2
2x1 + x2 −x3 + 2x4 = 3
x1, x2, x3, x4 ≥0.
Phase 1 consists in solving the artiﬁcial problem
min y5 + y6
s.t.



x1 + x2 + x3 −x4 + y5
= 2
2x1 + x2 −x3 + 2x4
+ y6 = 3
x1, x2, x3, x4, y5, y6 ≥0.

The optimal value is thus equal to −3, and x = (0, 0, 7, 5) is the optimal
solution.
Since the volume of work grows with the number of artiﬁcial variables,
one should not introduce more artiﬁcial variables than necessary. The mini-
mization problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax ≤b, x ≥0
requires no more than one artiﬁcial variable. By introducing slack variables
s = (sn+1, sn+2, . . . , sn+m), we ﬁrst obtain an equivalent standard problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax + Es = b, x, s ≥0
.
If b ≥0, this problem can be solved, as we have already noted, without
artiﬁcial variables. Let otherwise i0 be the index of the most negative coor-
dinate of the right-hand side b, and subtract equation no. i0 in the system
Ax + Es = b from all other equations with negative right-hand side, and
change ﬁnally the sign of equation no. i0.
The result is a system of equations of the form A′x + E′s = b′, which is
equivalent to the system Ax+Es = b and where b′ ≥0 and all the columns of
the matrix E′, except column no. i0, are equal to the corresponding columns
of the unit matrix E. Phase 1 of the simplex algorithm applied to the problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
A′x + E′s = b′, x, s ≥0
therefore requires only one artiﬁcial variable.

The simplex algorithm
Existence of optimal solutions and the duality theorem
The simplex algorithm is of course ﬁrst and foremost an eﬃcient algorithm
for solving concrete LP problems, but we can also use it to provide alternative
proofs of important theoretical results. These are corollaries to the following
theorem.
Theorem 13.6.1. Each standard LP problem with feasible points has a fea-
sible basic index set where one of the two stopping criteria in the simplex
algorithm is satisﬁed.
Proof. Bland’s rule ensures that phase 1 of the simplex algorithm stops with
a feasible basic index set from where to start phase 2, and Bland’s rule also
ensures that this phase stops in a feasible basic index set, where one of the
two stopping criteria is satisﬁed.
As ﬁrst corollary we obtain a new proof that every LP problem with ﬁnite
value has optimal solutions (Theorem 12.1.1).
Corollary 13.6.2. Each linear minimization problem with feasible solutions
and downwards bounded objective function has an optimal solution.
Proof. Since each LP problem can be replaced by an equivalent LP problem
in standard form, it is suﬃcient to consider such problems. The only way
for the simplex algorithm to stop, when the objective function is bounded
below, is to stop at a basic solution which satisﬁes the optimality criterion.
So it follows at once from the above theorem that there exists an optimal
solution if the objective function is bounded below and the set of feasible
solutions is nonempty.
We can also give an algorithmic proof of the Duality theorem.
Corollary 13.6.3 (Duality theorem). If the linear optimization problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
has feasible solutions, then it has the same optimal value as the dual maxi-
mization problem
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c.
Proof. Let α be the feasible basic index set where the simplex algorithm
stops. If the optimality criterion is satisﬁed at α, then it follows from Theo-
rem 13.4.2 that the minimization problem and the dual maximization prob-
lem have the same ﬁnite optimal value. If instead the algorithm stops because

The simplex algorithm
the objective function is unbounded below, then the dual problem has no fea-
sible points according to Theorem 13.4.2, and the value of both problems is
equal to −∞, by deﬁnition.
By writing general minimization problems in standard form, one can also
deduce the general form of the duality theorem from the above special case.

Sensitivity analysis
In Section 12.1, we studied how the optimal value and the optimal solution
depend on the coeﬃcients of the objective function. In this section we shall
study the same issue in connection with the simplex algorithm and also study
how the solution to the LP problem
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
depends on the right-hand side b. In real LP problems, the coeﬃcients of the
objective function and the constraints are often not exactly known, some of
them might even be crude estimates, and it is then of course important to
know how sensitive the optimal solution is to errors in input data. And even
if the input data are accurate, it is of course interesting to know how the
optimum solution is aﬀected by changes in one or more of the coeﬃcients.
Let α be a basic index set of the matrix A, and let x(b) denote the
corresponding basic solution to the system Ax = b, i.e.
x(b)α = A−1
∗αb
and
x(b)j = 0 for all j /∈α.
Suppose that the LP problem (P) has an optimal solution for certain
given values of b and c, and that this solution has been obtained because the
simplex algorithm stopped at the basic index set α. For that to be the case,
the basic solution x(b) has to be feasible, i.e.
(i)
A−1
∗αb ≥0,
and the optimality criterion z ≥0 in the simplex algorithm has to be satisﬁed.
Since
z = c −ATy
and
y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα,
we have z = c −(A−1
∗αA)Tcα, which means that the optimality criterion can
be written as
(ii)
z(c) = c −(A−1
∗αA)Tcα ≥0.

The simplex algorithm

Conversely, x(b) is an optimal solution to the LP problem (P) for all b
and c that satisfy the conditions (i) and (ii), because the optimality criterion
in the simplex algorithm is then satisﬁed.
Condition (i) is a system of homogeneous linear inequalities in the vari-
ables b1, b2, . . . , bm, and it deﬁnes a polyhedral cone Bα in Rm, while (ii)
is a system of homogeneous linear inequalities in the variables c1, c2, . . . , cn
and deﬁnes a polyhedral cone Cα in Rn. In summary, we have the following
result:
x(b) is an optimal solution to the LP problem (P) for all b ∈Bα and all
c ∈Cα.
Now suppose that we have solved the problem (P) for given values of b
and c with x = x(b) as optimal solution and λ as optimal value. Condition
(ii) determines how much we are allowed to change the coeﬃcients of the
objective function without changing the optimal solution; x is still an optimal
solution to the perturbed problem

The simplex algorithm
if z(c + ∆c) = z(c) + z(∆c) ≥0, i.e. if
(13.12)
∆c −(A−1
∗αA)T(∆c)α ≥−z(c).
The optimal value is of course changed to λ + ⟨∆c, x⟩.
Inequality (13.12) deﬁnes a polyhedron in the variables ∆c1, ∆c2, . . . ,
∆cn.
If for instance ∆cj = 0 for all j except j = k, i.e. if only the ck-
coeﬃcient of the objective function is allowed to change, then inequality
(13.12) determines a (possibly unbounded) closed interval [−dk, ek] around 0
for ∆ck.
If instead we change the right-hand side of the constraints replacing the
vector b by b+∆b, then x(b+∆b) becomes an optimal solution to the problem
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b + ∆b, x ≥0
as long as the solution is feasible, i.e. as long as A−1
∗α(b + ∆b) ≥0. After
simpliﬁcation, this results in the condition
A−1
∗α(∆b) ≥−x(b)α,
which is a system of linear inequalities that determines how to choose ∆b. If
∆bi = 0 for all indices except i = k, then the set of solutions for ∆bk is an
interval around 0 of the form [−dk, ek].
The printouts of softwares for the simplex algorithm generally contain
information on these intervals.

in a speciﬁc case with six foods and four nutrient requirements. The fol-

The sensitivity report shows that the optimal solution remains unchanged
as long as the price of food 1 stays in the interval [5.73 −0.14, 5.73 + 0.33],
ceteris paribus. A price change of z units in this range changes the optimal
value by 5.73 z units.
A price reduction of food 4 with a maximum of 3.27, or an unlimited
price increase of the same food, ceteris paribus, does not aﬀect the optimal
solution, nor the optimal value.
The set of price changes that leaves the optimal solution unchanged is
a convex set, since it is a polyhedron according to inequality (13.12). The
optimal solution of our example is therefore unchanged if for example the
prices of foods 1, 2 and 3 are increased by 0.20, 1.20 and 0.10, respectively,
because ∆c = (0.20, 1.20, 0.10, 0, 0, 0) is a convex combination of allowable
increases, since
0.20
0.33 + 1.20

The sensitivity report also shows how the optimal solution is aﬀected
by certain changes in the right-hand side b. The optimal solution remains
unchanged, for example, if the need for nutrient 1 would increase from 10
to 15, since the constraint is not binding and the increase 5 is less than the
permitted increase 9.07.
The sensitivity report also tells us that the new optimal solution will still
be derived from the same basic index set as above, if b4 is increased by say 20
units from 18 to 38, an increase that is within the scope of the permissible.
So in this case, the optimal diet will also only consist of foods 1 and 3, but

the optimal value will increase by 20 · 0.40 to 16.52 since the shadow price of
nutrient 4 is equal to 0.40.

with a bounded optimal value, starts from a given feasible basic index set
α0 and then generates a ﬁnite sequence (αk, xk, yk)p
k=0 of basic index sets αk,
corresponding basic solutions xk and vectors yk with the following properties:
(i) The basic solutions xk are extreme points of the polyhedron
X = {x ∈Rn | Ax = b, x ≥0}
of feasible solutions.
(ii) The line segments [xk, xk+1] are edges of the polyhedron X.
(iii) The objective function values (⟨c, xk⟩)p
k=0 form a decreasing sequence.
(iv) ⟨b, yk⟩= ⟨c, xk⟩for all k.

The simplex algorithm
(v) The algorithm stops after p iterations when the optimality criterion is
met, and yp is then an extreme point of the polyhedron
Y = {y ∈Rm | ATy ≤c}.
(vi) xp is an optimal solution to the primal problem, and yp is an optimal
solution to the dual problem
max ⟨b, y⟩
s.t.
ATy ≤c.
(vii) The vectors yk do not, however, belong to Y for 0 ≤k ≤p −1.
The optimal solution xp is obtained by moving along edges of the poly-
hedron X until an extreme point has been reached that also corresponds to
an extreme point of the polyhedron Y . Instead, we could move along edges
of the polyhedron Y , and this observation leads to the following method for
solving the minimization problem.
The dual simplex algorithm
Given a basic index set α such that z = c −ATy ≥0, where y = (A−1
∗α)Tcα.
Repeat steps 1–4 until a stop occurs.
1. Compute the basic solution x corresponding to α.
2. Stopping criterion: quit if x ≥0.
Optimal solution: x. Optimal dual solution: y.
Also quit if any of the constraint equations has the form a′
i1x1+a′
i2x2+
· · · + a′
inxn = b′
i with b′
i > 0 and a′
ij ≤0 for all j, because then there
are no feasible solutions to the primal problem.
3. Generate a new basic index set α′ by replacing one of the indices of α
in such a way that the new reduced cost vector z′ remains nonnegative
and ⟨b, y′⟩≥⟨b, y⟩, where y′ = (A−1
∗α′)Tcα′.
4. Update: α:= α′, y:= y′.
We refrain from specifying the necessary pivoting rules. Instead, we con-
sider a simple example.

s.t.



2y1 + y2

2y2 + y3 ≤2

+ 2y3 ≤3, y ≥0.
We can start the dual simplex algorithm from the basic index set α =
(4, 5, 6), and as usual, we have underlined the basic columns.
The cor-
responding basic solution x is not feasible since the coordinates of xα =
(−9, −12, −15) are negative. The bottom row [ 1 2 3 0 0 0 ] of the tableau
is the reduced cost vector zT = cT −yTA. The row vector yT = c T

can also be read in the bottom row; it is found below the matrix
−E, and y belongs to the polyhedron Y of feasible solutions to the dual
problem, since zT ≥0.
We will now gradually replace one element at a time in the basic index
set. As pivot row r, we choose the row that corresponds to the most negative
coordinate of xα, and in the ﬁrst iteration, this is the third row in the above
simplex tableau. To keep the reduced cost vector nonnegative, we must select
as pivot column a column k, where the matrix element ark is positive and
the ratio zk/ark is as small as possible. In the above tableau, this is the third
column, so we pivot around the element at location (3, 3). This leads to the
following tableau:

The most negative element of xα is to be found in the second row, and the
least ratio zk/a′

2k is obtained for k = 2.
Pivoting around the element at location (2, 2) leads to the following simplex

3, 1
3, 4
3), and the optimality
criterion is met since xα ≥0. The optimal value is 27 and (2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0)
is the optimal point. The dual maximization problem attains its maximum
at (1
3, 1
3, 4
3). The optimal solution to our original minimization problem is of
course x = (2, 5, 5).
13.9
Complexity
How many iterations are needed to solve an LP problem using the simplex
algorithm? The answer will depend, of course, on the size of the problem.
Experience shows that the number of iterations largely grows linearly with
the number of rows m and sublinearly with the number of columns n for
realistic problems, and in most real problems, n is a small multiple of m,
usually not more than 10m. The number of iterations is therefore usually
somewhere between m and 4m, which means that the simplex algorithm
generally performs very well.
The worst case behavior of the algorithm is bad, however (for all known
pivoting rules). Klee and Minty has constructed an example where the num-
ber of iterations grows exponentially with the size of the problem.
Example 13.9.1 (Klee and Minty, 1972). Consider the following LP problem
in n variables and with n inequality constraints:
max 2n−1x1 + 2n−2x2 + · · · + 2xn−1 + xn
s.t.

8x1 +
4x2 + x3

...
...
2nx1 + 2n−1x2 + . . . + 4xn−1 + xn ≤5n
The polyhedron of feasible solutions has in this case 2n extreme points.
Suppose that we apply the simplex algorithm to the equivalent standard
problem, in each iteration choosing as pivot column the column with the most
negative value of the reduced cost. If we start from the feasible basic solution
that corresponds to x = 0, then we have to go through all the 2n feasible
basic solutions before we ﬁnally reach the optimal solution (0, 0, . . . , 5n). The
number of iterations is therefore equal to 2n and thus increases exponentially
with n.
An algorithm for solving a problem in n variables is called strictly polyno-
mial if there exists a positive integer k such that the number of elementary

The simplex algorithm
arithmetic operations in the algorithm grows with n as at most O(nk). In
many algorithms, the number of operations also depends on the size of the
input data. An algorithm is called polynomial if the number of arithmetic
operations is growing as a polynomial in L, where L is the number of bi-
nary bits needed to represent all input (i.e. the matrices A, b and c in linear
programming).
Gaussian elimination is a strictly polynomial algorithm, because a system
of linear equations with n equations and n unknowns is solved with O(n3)
arithmetic operations.
Klee–Minty’s example and other similar examples demonstrate that the
simplex algorithm is not strictly polynomial. But all experience shows that
the simplex algorithm works very well, even if the worst case behavior is bad.
This is also supported by probabilistic analyzes, made by Borgwardt (1987),
Smale (1983), Adler and Megiddo (1985), among others. Such an analysis
shows, for example, that (a variant of) the simplex algorithm, given a certain
special probability distribution of the input data, on average converges after
O(m2) iterations, where m is the number of constraints.
The existence of a polynomial algorithm that solves LP problems (with
rational coeﬃcients as input data) was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1979 by Leonid
Khachiyan.
His so-called ellipsoid algorithm reduces LP problems to the
problem of ﬁnding a solution to a system Ax > b of strict inequalities with a
bounded set of solutions, and the algorithm generates a sequence of shrinking
ellipsoids, all guaranteed to contain all the solutions to the system. If the
center of an ellipsoid satisﬁes all inequalities of the system, then a solution
has been found, of course. Otherwise, the process stops when a generated
ellipsoid has too small volume to contain all solutions, if there are any, with
the conclusion that there are no solutions.
LP problems in standard form with n variables and input size L are solved
by the ellipsoid method in O(n4L) arithmetic operations. However, in spite
of this nice theoretical result, it was soon clear that the ellipsoid method
could not compete with the simplex algorithm on real problems of moderate
size due to slow convergence. (The reason for this is, of course, that the
implicit constant in the O-estimate is very large.)
A new polynomial algorithm was discovered in 1984 by Narendra Kar-
markar. His algorithm generates a sequence of points, which lie in the interior
of the set of feasible points and converge towards an optimal point. The algo-
rithm uses repeated centering of the generated points by a projective scaling
transformation. The theoretical complexity bound of the original version of
the algorithm is also O(n4L).
Karmarkar’s algorithm turned out to be competitive with the simplex
algorithm on practical problems, and his discovery was the starting point for

an intensive development of alternative interior point methods for LP prob-
lems and more general convex problems. We will study such an algorithm in
Chapter 18.
It is still an open problem whether there exists any strictly polynomial
algorithm for solving LP problems.

The simplex algorithm
The sale price of A and B is 500 SEK and 350 SEK, respectively per pair. It
costs 200 SEK to manufacture a pair of shoes of model B. However, the cost
of producing a pair of shoes of model A is uncertain due to malfunctioning
machines, and it can only be estimated to be between 300 SEK and 410
SEK. Show that the manufacturer may nevertheless decide how many pairs
of shoes he shall manufacture of each model to maximize his proﬁt.
13.14 Joe wants to meet his daily requirements of vitamins P, Q and R by only
living on milk and bread. His daily requirement of vitamins is 6, 12 and 4
mg, respectively. A liter of milk costs 7.50 SEK and contains 2 mg of P, 2 mg
of Q and nothing of R; a loaf of bread costs 20 SEK and contains 1 mg of P,
4 mg of Q and 4 mg of R. The vitamins are not toxic, so a possible overdose
does not harm. Joe wants to get away as cheaply as possible. Which daily
bill of fare should he choose? Suppose that the price of milk begins to rise.
How high can it be without Joe having to change his bill of fare?
13.15 Using the assumptions of Lemma 13.4.1, show that the reduced cost zk
is equal to the direction derivative of the objective function ⟨c, x⟩in the
direction −v.
13.16 This exercise outlines an alternative method to prevent cycling in the sim-
plex algorithm. Consider the problem
(P)
min ⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b, x ≥0
and let α be an arbitrary feasible basic index set with corresponding basic
solution x. For each positive number ϵ, we deﬁne new vectors x(ϵ) ∈Rn
and b(ϵ) ∈Rm as follows:
x(ϵ)α = xα + (ϵ, ϵ2, . . . , ϵm)
and
x(ϵ)j = 0 for all j /∈α,
b(ϵ) = Ax(ϵ).
Then x(ϵ) is obviously a nonnegative basic solution to the system Ax = b(ϵ)
with α as the corresponding basic index set, and the coordinates of the vector
b(ϵ) are polynomials of degree m in the variable ϵ.
a) Prove that all basic solutions to the system Ax = b(ϵ) are non-degenerate
except for ﬁnitely many numbers ϵ > 0. Consequently, there is a number
ϵ0 > 0 so that all basic solution are non-degenerate if 0 < ϵ < ϵ0.
b) Prove that if 0 < ϵ < ϵ0, then all feasible basic index sets for the problem
(Pϵ)
min
⟨c, x⟩
s.t.
Ax = b(ϵ), x ≥0
are also feasible basic index sets for the original problem (P).

c) The simplex algorithm applied to problem (Pϵ) will therefore stop at a
feasible basic index set β, which is also feasible for problem (P), provided
ϵ is a suﬃciently small number. Prove that β also satisﬁes the stopping
condition for problem (P).
Cycling can thus be avoided by the following method: Perturb the right-
hand side by forming x(ϵ) and the column matrix b(ϵ), where ϵ is a small
positive number. Use the simplex algorithm on the perturbed problem. The
algorithm stops at a basic index set β.
The corresponding unperturbed
problem stops at the same basic index set.
13.17 Suppose that A is a polynomial algorithm for solving systems Cx ≥b of
linear inequalities. When applied to a solvable system, the algorithm ﬁnds a
solution x and stops with the output A(C, b) = x. For unsolvable systems,
it stops with the output A(C, b) = ∅. Use the algorithm A to construct a
polynomial algorithm for solving arbitrary LP problems

s.t.
Ax ≥b, x ≥0.

CONVEXITY AND OPTIMIZATION – PART II

Bibliogracal and historical notices
Bibliograﬁcal and historical
notices
The theory of convex programs has its roots in a paper by Kuhn–Tucker [1],
which deals with necessary and suﬃcient conditions for optimality in nonlin-
ear problems. Kuhn–Tucker noted the connection between Lagrange multi-
pliers and saddle points, and they focused on the role of convexity. A related
result with Lagrange multiplier conditions had otherwise been shown before
by John [1] for general diﬀerentiable constraints, and KKT conditions are
present for the ﬁrst time in an unpublished master’s thesis by Karush [1].
Theorem 11.2.1 can be found in Uzawa [1].
The duality theorem in linear programming was known as a result of game
theory by John von Neumann, but the ﬁrst published proof of this theorem
appears in Gale–Kuhn–Tucker [1].
The earliest known example of linear programming can be found in works
by Fourier [1] from the 1820s and deals with the problem of determining the
best, with respect to the maximum norm, ﬁt to an overdetermined system of
linear equations. Fourier reduced this problem to minimizing a linear form
over a polyhedron, and he also hinted a method, equivalent to the simplex
algorithm, to compute the minimum.
It was to take until the 1940s before practical problems on a larger scale
began to be formulated as linear programming. The transportation prob-
lem was formulated by Hitchcock [1], who also gave a constructive solution
method, and the diet problem was studied by Stigler [1], who, however, failed
to compute the exact solution. The Russian mathematician and economist
Kantorovich [1] had some years before formulated and solved LP problems
in production planning, but his work was not noticed outside the USSR and
would therefore not inﬂuence the subsequent development.
The need for mathematical methods for solving military planning prob-
lems had become apparent during the Second World War, and in 1947 a
group of mathematicians led by George Dantzig and Marshall Wood worked
at the U.S. Department of the Air Force with such problems. The group’s

work resulted in the realization of the importance of linear programming,
and the ﬁrst version of the simplex algorithm was described by Dantzig [1]
and Wood–Dantzig [1].
The simplex algorithm is contemporary with the ﬁrst computers, and
this suddenly made it possible to treat large problems numerically and con-
tributed to a breakthrough for linear programming. A conference on linear
programming, arranged by Tjalling Koopmans 1949 in Chicago, was also an
important step in the popularization of linear programming. During this
conference, papers on linear programming were presented by economists,
mathematicians, and statisticians. The papers were later published in Koop-
mans [1], and this book became the start for a rapidly growing literature on
linear programming.
Dantzig’s [2] basic article 1951 treated the non-degenerate case of the sim-
plex algorithm, and the possibility of cycling in the degenerate case caused
initially some concern.
The ﬁrst example with cycling was constructed
by Hoﬀman [1], but even before this discovery Charnes [1] had proposed
a method for avoiding cycling.
Other such methods were then given by
Dantzig–Orden–Wolfe [1] and Wolfe [2]. Bland’s [1] simple pivoting rule is
relatively recent.
It is easy to modify the simplex algorithm so that it is directly applicable
to LP problems with bounded variables, which was ﬁrst noted by Charnes–
Lemke [1] and Dantzig [3].
The dual simplex algorithm was developed by Beale [1] and Lemke [1].
The currently most eﬃcient variants of the simplex algorithm are primal-dual
algorithms.
Convex quadratic programs can be solved by a variant of the simplex
algorithm, formulated by Wolfe [1].
Khachiyan’s [1] complexity results was based on the ellipsoid algorithm,
which was ﬁrst proposed by Shor [1] as a method in general convex optimiza-
tion. See Bland–Goldfarb–Todd [1] for an overview of the ellipsoid method.
Many variants of Karmarkar’s [1] algorithm were developed after his pub-
lication in 1984. Algorithms for LP problems with O(n3L) as complexity
bound are described by Gonzaga [1] and Ye [1].
There are numerous textbooks on linear programming. Two early such
books, written by pioneers in the ﬁeld, are Dantzig [4], which in addition to
the mathematical material also contains a thorough historical overview, many
applications and an extensive bibliography, and Gale [1], which provides a
concise but mathematically rigorous presentation of linear programming with
an emphasis on economic applications. More recent books are Chvatal [1]
and Luenberger [1].

11.3 b) Let L: Ω× Λ →R
and
L1 : (R × Ω) × (R+ × Λ) →R be
the Lagrange functions of the problems (P) and (P′), respectively, and
let φ and φ1 be the corresponding dual functions. The two Lagrange
functions are related as follows:
L1(t, x, λ0, λ) = (1 −λ0)(t −f(x)) + L(x, λ).
The Lagrange function L1 is for ﬁxed (λ0, λ) ∈R+ × Λ bounded below
if and only if λ0 = 1 and λ ∈dom φ. Hence, dom φ1 = {1} × dom φ.
Moreover, φ1(1, λ) = φ(λ) for all λ ∈dom φ.

The point x = λx(1) + (1 −λ)x(2) is feasible for the
problem (Pb), where b = λb(1) + (1 −λ)b(2). Therefore,

12.1 All nonempty sets X(b) = {x | Ax ≥b} of feasible points have the
same recession cone, since recc X(b) = {x | Ax ≥0} if X(b) ̸= ∅.
Therefore, it follows from Theorem 12.1.1 that the optimal value v(b)
is ﬁnite if X(b) ̸= ∅. The convexity of the optimal value function v is a
consequence of the same theorem, because
v(b) = min{⟨−b, y⟩| ATy ≤c, y ≥0},
according to the duality theorem.

13.17 First, use the algorithm A on the system consisting of the linear in-
equalities Ax ≥b, x ≥0, ATy ≤c, y ≥0, ⟨c, x⟩≤⟨b, y⟩.
If the
algorithm delivers a solution (x, y), then x is an optimal solution to the
minimization problem because of the complementarity theorem.
If the algorithm instead shows that the system has no solution, then we
use the algorithm on the system Ax ≥b, x ≥0 to determine whether
the minimization problem has feasible points or not. If this latter sys-
tem has feasible points, then it follows from our ﬁrst investigation that
the dual problem has no feasible points, and we conclude that the ob-
jective function is unbounded below, because of the duality theorem.
