Foreword
For at least 50 years, the inverted pendulum has been the most popular benchmark,
among others, for teaching and research in control theory. Achieving its stability
problem has become then a common engineering challenge. The fundamental focus
of this book is then to enhance the wealth of this robotic system and provide an overall
picture of historical, current trends and challenging problems in control theory and
possible applications in mobile robotics, based on its simple structure and its rich
nonlinear model.
The book is a timely and comprehensive reference guide for graduate students,
researchers, engineers and practitioners in the areas of control theory and robotics.
Readers will find it to be a clear and understandable textbook for control system
courses at colleges and universities. It is written for senior electrical, mechanical,
aerospace or mechatronics students.
Written by eminent scientists in the field of control theory and robotics from 12
countries (China, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Oman, Saudi Arabia,
Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom and USA), this book covers the latest advanced con-
trol approaches based on the stabilization principle as well as the trajectory generation
methods of the inverted pendulum. Approaches include sliding-mode control, PID
control and intelligent control techniques, among others. Observer design problems
are also considered. The efficiency of the controllers-based observers approaches are
proved for overcoming the complications introduced by the presence of uncertain
dynamics, external disturbance, faults, non-holonomic kinematic constraints as well
as under-actuated configurations.
Not only does this book provide the readers with control fundamentals and
algorithms but it also discusses key applications using different experimental
platforms including the cart-inverted pendulum, the inertia-wheel pendulum, the
mobile-wheeled inverted pendulum, etc.
In total, 14 chapters written by active researchers in the field are compiled in this
book to provide an overall picture of the most challenging problems to be solved in
control theory from design to experiments. The book begins with a survey chapter
where the available varieties of the inverted pendulum system are depicted, highlight-
ing the richness of the dynamics of such system and then providing an overall picture
of different control design approaches and trendy robotic problems related to its sim-
ple structure. The book covers then the topic in four parts: Part I, organized in four
chapters, presents applications of robust state estimation and control with applica-
tions to pendulum-cart systems; Part II, structured in four chapters, depicted different

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
control approaches designed for under-actuated mechanical systems with applica-
tions to the inertia-wheel pendulum; Part III is organized in three chapters where
nonlinear controllers are designed for mobile inverted pendulum systems; finally,
Part IV, structured in three chapters, proposes robust controllers-based observers via
Takagi–Sugeno or linear approaches.
The following researchers are particularly acknowledged for their considerable
efforts:
●
We are grateful to Professor Leonid Fridman from Facultad de Ingeniería, UNAM,
Mexico, for the fruitful collaboration. It would not have been possible to compile
the book without his precious help, particularly the contributions proposed in
Chapters 2, 3, 6 and 7 and experimental results presented in Chapters 2 and 3.
●
We thank the Emeritus ProfessorsToshio Fukuda from Nagoya University, Japan,
Mohamed Darouach from Research Centre for Automatic Control of Nancy,
France, and MagdiSadek Mahmoud from King Fahd University of Petroleum and
Minerals, Saudi Arabia, for their valuable supports and contributions at Chapters
9, 12 and 14.
●
We are grateful to Professor Guillermo Fernandez-Anaya from Universidad
Iberoamericana, Mexico, and the Emeritus Professor José Ragot from Centre de
Recherche en Automatique de Nancy, France, for their helpful and professional
efforts to provide precious comments and reviews.

The inverted pendulum is a classical problem in dynamics and control theory widely
used as a fundamental system for testing emerging control algorithms. In spite of
its very simple structure appropriate for developing real-time implementation, the
inverted-pendulummodelisconsideredtherichestoneamongcommonroboticbench-
marks. Not only it can describe many engineering problems but also it can explain
several biological examples. Various mathematical models and experimental designs
for the inverted pendulum exist offering an attractive tool for education and research.
The objective of this survey is to present an overview of the available varieties of
such system, highlighting the richness of its dynamics and then providing an overall
picture of different control design approaches and trendy robotic problems related
to its simple structure. In total, 300 references in the open literature, dating back to
Galileo’s first experiments written in 1602, are compiled to provide an overall pic-
ture of historical, current and challenging developments based on the stabilization
principle of the inverted pendulum.

Introduction
A pendulum, pendere in Latin, is a string, cord or massless rod of length l that allows a
suspended mass m, also called Bob, to swing back and forth, as shown by Figure 1.1, in
a stable manner with limited amplitude. Simple pendulum system, like crane payload
and grandfather pendulum clock, see Figure 1.2, have its center of mass down unlike
inverted-pendulum system which is an inherently unstable system, has its center of
mass higher than its pivot as shown by Figure 1.3 and must be actively balanced in
order to remain upright. A torque T must be applied at its pivot point in order to
oscillate the pivot point vertically and creating a remaining torque on the pendulum.

Since Galileo’s first experiments written in his first letter in 1602 [1], the pendu-
lum system was introduced in all almost physical courses to illustrate basic concepts
of periodic motion and conservation of energy. The valuable hypothesis of Galileo
of the isochronisms assuming that the period of the pendulum is approximately inde-
pendent of the amplitude of the swing was the most fundamental one. Galileo has
also found that the period is independent of the suspended mass, and proportional to
the square root of the length of the pendulum.

The pendulum has played a significant role not only in the development of science
and education but also in culture and politics [2,3]. Besides, its initial utilization as a
clock by Christian Huygens in 1656 as a first measure of time, the simple pendulum
was studied by the leading scientists of the seventeenth century, like Newton and
Hooke for establishing a lot of physical laws. In that framework, we can cite the
conservation laws, the collision laws, the value of the acceleration due to gravity g,
the finding of the variation in g from equatorial to polar regions and consequently
discoveringtheoblateshapeoftheearthandmainlythedecisiveevidenceforNewton’s
synthesis of terrestrial and celestial mechanics [3].
A simple demonstration of stabilizing the center of mass of an inverted pendulum
higher than its pivot is balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one’s finger
by applying a horizontal force F as shown by Figure 1.4. This concept can be also
displayed by a simple device that allows observing the movement of a liquid placed
in a basin at the top of the structure.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
For the inverted pendulum, it has been necessary to wait until the beginning of the
twentieth century to have the first findings around its dynamical system. As claimed
in [4], the first results were initiated by Stephenson, who demonstrated in 1908
that the inverted pendulum could be stabilized by applying rapid, vertical, harmonic
oscillations to its base [5], and who established in 1909, the stability conditions for
the double and the triple inverted pendulums [6]. In 1932, Lowenstern developed the
general equations of motion for the inverted pendulums [7]. It is just in the 1960s that
the dynamics of inverted pendulums were well understood. In their paper History of
Inverted Pendulum [8], the authors present several of the early treatments from the
literature between 1960 and 1970 and state that Roberge demonstrated a first solution
to the single inverted-pendulum system at M.I.T. in his aptly named bachelor’s thesis,
The Mechanical Seal [9], supervised by Leonard Gould. They also claim that Donald,
Higdon and Cannon described, in 1963, systems with multiple independent inverted
pendula at Stanford University [10] and that Schaefer and Cannon discussed, in 1966,
jointed and flexible inverted-pendulum systems [11]. Several interesting papers are
thenfollowed[12–14]. Itisjustwiththetakeoffofthecontroltheoryandroboticsatthe
end of the 1960s that the inverted pendulum becomes the most popular system, among
others, for teaching and researches. Solutions of high interest are then proposed to
solve various control problems.At the first stage, the stabilization problem around the
upright position [15–19] and the swing-up problem [20–23] are solved independently.
At the last stage, complete solution is then proposed [24–29]. Some solutions are then
following to solve the tracking problem [30,31] and the observer-based controller
problem with separation principle [32,33]. The parameter identification problem is
also considered in some papers [34–36]. Few papers dealt then with the delay-control
problem [37,38], the bifurcation analysis [39–41] and possible chaos dynamics of the
inverted pendulum [42,43].
It is important to note that the simple structure of the inverted-pendulum model
allowing carrying out experimental validations is one of the key motivations of using
this benchmark in education and in research. Furthermore, as shown by Figure 1.5,
many engineering systems are based on the stabilization principle of the inverted
pendulum. For the liftoff of rockets and flight of missiles, for example, the first
achievement is done by Norris at California Institute of Technology, in 1956, in his
Engineer’s thesis [44]. Standing and walking of bipeds using the stabilization principle
oftheinvertedpendulumwasinitiatedbythepioneersHemami,Vukobratovic, Raibert
and Kajita in their works presented in [45–50], whereas self-balancing problem of
wheeled inverted pendulums was started in [51–53].
Since more than seven decades, the inverted pendulum is considered the most
popular benchmark in control theory and robotics. For example, Scopus bibliographic
database shows more than 6,000 of references written around the dynamical model of
this important system. The analysis of the inverted-pendulum system and the design
of different control laws have proposed by several textbooks [54–66], monographs
[67] and survey papers [68–72].
The objective of this first chapter is to present the history and survey of open
and current problems in control theory and robotics written around the inverted-
pendulum system. The chapter is organized as follows: in Section 1.2, an overview

then extended in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4, advances and challenging achievements
in control theory will be deeply expanded. Finally, an overview of major accom-
plishments in the robotics field based in the stabilization principle of the inverted
pendulum will be advanced in Section 1.5.
1.2
Inverted-pendulum benchmarks: an overview
Several benchmark systems of high interest exist in the literature of control theory and
are frequently used as experimental models to validate the efficiency of control algo-
rithms. In the field of robotics, some examples of high interest exist. Their related
mathematical models are generally derived using two traditional formulations: the
Lagrange–Euler formulation and the recursive Newton–Euler formulation [73–80].
The Lagrange–Euler approach uses the Lagrangian function which is the difference
between the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the robotic system which is
composed on different compounds, while Newton–Euler approach describes the com-
bined translational and rotational dynamics of the different rigid bodies with respect
to the each link’s center of mass. In the literature, the Lagrange–Euler formulation
is generally preferred since the controllers are conducted to obtain the time evolu-
tion of the generalized coordinates of the robotic system. Using Lagrange approach
or Newton–Euler approach, the analytic developments must lead to a dynamical
robotic system.
The reader can refer to Chapters 2, 10 and 14 of this book to find mathematical
developments based on Lagrange–Euler method expanded for establishing examples
of pendulum dynamical models.

considered, among the last examples, the most fundamental one. Various models for
the inverted pendulum exist in the literature. They can be classified as follows:
●
Inverted pendulums on a pivot: n rigid bodies (serial or parallel) are joined
together and fixed on a pivot where the system inputs are the m voltages of the
motors at each joint and the outputs are the n pendulum angles. In most cases,
under-actuated inverted pendulums are considered such as n > m.

Inverted pendulums on a cart: a multilink system of n rigid bodies is attached to
an inherently stable moving base (the cart). Hence, an under-actuated mechanical
system is obtained such as the system input is the force acting upon the cart and
where the (n + 1) outputs are the cart position at the n pendulum angles.

Wheeled inverted pendulum: a single-link rigid body is self-balanced by an
unstable moving base mounted on one or two wheels. The inputs and the outputs
vary depending from one design to another but an under-actuated mechanical
system is always considered. The system can act on 2D or on 3D space.
For better understanding, the common varieties of the inverted-pendulum benchmark
are summarized in Table 1.1 where a synoptic diagram and the related references to
related mathematical models are given for each variety.

Experimental laboratories
The simple structure of the inverted-pendulum model allowing carrying out exper-
imental validations in education and in research was one of the key motivations of
using this benchmark. Numerous real and virtual platforms exist.

parameters of the inverted pendulum on a cart of INTECO available at National
Autonomous University of Mexico at Chapters 2 and 3 of this book and about the

1.3.2
Universities platforms
A number of universities and research laboratories around the world have designed and
built their own real inverted platforms to validate the efficiency of several emerging
control techniques and verify their implementation. In this framework, we can cite
the inertia flywheel pendulum mechatronic kit of Huafan University (Taiwan) [99],
the balancing inverted pendulum on a parallel manipulator of LARM laboratory of
University of Cassino (Italy) [119], the Furuta pendulum of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (USA) [120], the flying inverted pendulum of the Institute for Dynamic
Systems and Control (Switzerland) [121], the inverted pendulum of Department of
Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering of Western Michigan University (USA)
[122], the single/double inverted pendulum of the University of Adelaide, School
of Mechanical Engineering (Australia) [123], the rotary inverted pendulum of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Troy (USA) [124] and so on.
Furthermore, full details about the inertia wheel pendulum of the LIRMM
Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics (France) can be found
in Chapter 5, whereas the balancing inverted pendulum of LARM laboratory of
University of Cassino (Italy) is fully described in Chapter 10.
1.3.3 Virtual models
To avoid unreliable and expensive real platforms, real experiments are often sub-
stituted by virtual reality enabled by tools. One may find good examples of virtual
control laboratories of pendulum-car benchmark using for example SimMechanics in
MATLAB/Simulink environment [125] or solid works using MATLAB–Simulink,
ControlDesk, and a DS1104 board from dSPACE software [126]. Open source
inverted-pendulum virtual models are also available [127] making this an ideal student
project for an undergraduate controls curriculum.
Nowadays, many students communicate with the educational material through
internet-based technologies. Time savings, sharing resources of expensive equipment
and individual access to experimentation are the main factors that motivate remote lab-
oratories over the world. Remote pioneered projects based on the inverted pendulum
can be found in [128,129].

Advances in control theory
1.4.1 Why the inverted pendulum is the most popular benchmark?
Although the structure of the pendulum systems already presented seems to be quite
simple, many standard techniques in control theory are ineffective when tested on this
benchmark. The inverted-pendulum system is a typical nonlinear dynamic system
including a stable equilibrium point when the pendulum is in a pending position and
an unstable equilibrium point when the pendulum is in an upright position [63]. When
the system is moved up from the pending position to the upright position, the model
is nonlinear with the pendulum angle. The control problem of the system is much
more difficult than it appears to be for many reasons, e.g., geometric properties of
the system are lost when the pendulum moves through horizontal positions [130].
Indeed, the output-zeroing manifold does not contain any equilibrium points, the
relative degree of the system is not constant and the controllability distribution of the
system does not have a constant rank. The system is therefore not linearizable [131].
The control problem to be solved is generally composed of two main specific tasks:
the first one is the swing-up control problem and the second one is the stabilization
problem around the unstable equilibrium point [132]. Finding a continuous feedback
that can render the vertical upward position of the pendulum globally asymptotically
stable has been considered a major problem for a long time.
1.4.2
Emerging control problems
The inverted pendulum was also used to illustrate major emerging problems in control
theory which are mainly:
●
Swing-up: The control objective is to upswinging the pendulum from its stable
position to its unstable position. It was first proposed by Furuta in 1976 [134].
Many papers are proposed in this framework but one of the most interesting
was written by Astrom and Furuta in which properties of the simple strategies
for swinging up based on energy control are presented, and the idea to give the
nonlinear system the energy of the upright position is clearly explained [23].
●
Stabilization problem around the upright position: This problem is a very
popular example in control education, generally introduced to undergraduate-
level students from a linearization of the nonlinear model using a first-order
Taylor approach at the unstable equilibrium point. As a result, a linear system is
obtained, and a feedback gain is computed using a linear control strategy such as
LQR or pole placement [19,54–57,67,68]. The importance of such an approach in
education is that many typical problems in control theory can be highlighted such
as undesirable dynamics exhibited by unstable and nonminimum phase systems
and difficulties of controlling single input/multioutput systems. In research, the
stabilization problem is generally solved using a nonlinear controller [62,63].
One of the important objectives is to stabilize the system around its unstable
equilibrium point and having at the same time a larger basin of attraction for initial
conditions. But the most important problem is to guarantee the global stabilization

of the system dynamics. One possibility to achieve global stabilization of the
pendulum is by means of hybrid controllers [59,60]. Typically, two different
controllaws areemployed, onetakescareofthelocalstabilizationofthependulum
in the upright position and the other swings the pendulum up. Another way is to
stabilize the system by means of continuous feedback. In this way, for almost all
initial conditions, the upright position is attractive (though not stable).
●
The tracking problem: The objective is to effectively follow a desired reference
input for outputs, the position and velocity variables in our case. The importance
for such unstable system is taking into account the stochastic disturbances is
evident.
●
Observer-based control problem: It is well known that output feedback con-
trol or observer design is a very important problem in control systems, since in
many practical nonlinear control systems, state variables are often unavailable.
Observer-based controllers have attracted some interest in nonlinear systems.
For inverted-pendulum systems, such problem is widely studied when velocity
variables are often considered unavailable states. The main further is the devel-
opment of the separation property; that is, the controller and the observer can be
independently designed.
Table 1.2 gives an overview of different solutions proposed in the literature for solving
main control problems presented below. On the other hand, inverted-pendulum bench-
marks are used to illustrate almost all emerging ideas in control theory techniques.
Table 1.3 depicted few high cited scientific articles for each control approach.
It is also important to note that one of the complex problems to achieve for
inverted pendulum was the global asymptotic stabilization of the origin by a single
and smooth continuous feedback performing both the upswing and the stabilization
control. A complete solution to this problem can be found in [168,171].
On other side, accurate mathematical models of physical systems are essential
for understanding the behavior of actual systems under different operating conditions

and for designing control systems. In mechanical systems, especially the inverted
pendulum, difficultyoftheexactdeterminationofsystemparametersadverselyaffects
the accuracy of the models that’s why an experimental validation procedure of the
control laws is often accompanied by a system parametric identification/estimation.
A literature search showed that very few papers are devoted for such framework
[34–36,225–228].
1.4.3
Challenging control problems
In this section, challenging and still open control problems will be presented. They
include but are not limited to the following fields:
●
Robustness-based sliding mode techniques: Besides stability, robustness is
another important requirement to be considered in the study of uncertain nonlinear
inverted-pendulum systems. Since uncertainty is source of instability, especially
for tracking problems, common solutions are no more effective. Control design
methods are then referred to confront system uncertainties and/or stochastic per-
turbations. Several promising directions can be chosen in such situations. In our
sense, sliding mode observers-based controllers, very appropriate for robotic
tracking problems with unavailable velocities measurements, will continue to
have an enlarging impact in the following years in such framework. Sliding mode
observers were initially proposed in [229] for systems with a relative degree equal
to one and Lipschitz uncertainties. Then, they are extended for many other spe-
cific situations with high interest in [230–235]. In this book, solutions for solving
problems related to robustness-based sliding mode techniques are proposed in
Chapters 2–4, 6, 7, 9 and 13.

●
Robustness-based T–S fuzzy models: T–S fuzzy model-based observers/
controllers are widely popular models providing simple and effective solutions to
the control of plants that are complex, uncertain and ill-defined such as inverted-
pendulum systems. Several research works using the inverted-pendulum systems
are still recently organized in such directions [236–241]. In this book, solutions
to the robustness-based T–S fuzzy models are found in Chapters 12 and 13.
●
Robust fault-tolerant control: Nowadays, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant con-
trol are considered major problems in the modern control theory [242]. Fault can
occur in any part of the system and do degrade the feedback system perfor-
mances, which leads to instability and even can result into dangerous situations.
The inverted pendulum as inherent unstable nonlinear system with possible
parameter uncertainties and possible faults in sensors and actuators may be con-
sidered a typical example to validate new approaches for robust fault-tolerant
control [243–245]. In this book, robust fault-tolerant control problem is solved
in Chapter 13.
●
Fractional-order control: Fractional calculus is an old theory for solving differ-
ential equations. However, for only a few years, emerging and effective methods
in differentiation and integration of noninteger-order equations make fractional-
order systems and also fractional-order controllers more and more attractive
for control engineering applications. Fractional-order controllers are generally
applied to enhance the system control performance. Some initiatives have been
launched in this direction deriving some fractional-order inverted-pendulum mod-
els and/or using fractional-order-controller-based inverted-pendulum systems
[246–249]. A solution to fractional-order proportional–integral–derivative (PID)
controller is proposed in Chapter 4.
●
Event-triggered control: In recent time, event-triggered control has received
much attention since it has been demonstrated to reduce the amount of com-
putations while still maintain a desired closed-loop behavior. It also allows the
reduction of communications in control systems in which the information is trans-
mitted through a shared network. Besides, the event-based control strategies have
proved to be a good alternative to deal with delays and packet losses in commu-
nication networks. In addition, the event-based strategy offers several advantages
such as protecting the actuators from frequent wear and tear and also reducing the
waste of electric energy due to the switching voltage. In such framework, several
recent papers have used the inverted pendulum as a typical example to prove such
a challenging controller [250–253].
●
Time-delayed control: It is well known that some important classes of systems,
like oscillators and double integrators cannot be stabilized by a static output feed-
back, may be stabilized by inserting an artificial time delay in the feedback.
Furthermore, static output-feedback controllers have advantages over observer-
based controllers, since the design of observer-based controller is a complicated
procedure mainly when uncertainties are considered. Several research papers had
attempted to solve such a problem using time-delayed feedback [254]. Further-
more, inthepresenceoftimedelays, thewell-knowncontroltechniquesstabilizing
the inverted-pendulum benchmarks may result in inadequate behavior and may

18
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
even cause instability. The existence of time delay creates infinite dimensional
dynamics and complicates the theoretical analysis. The dynamics of the inverted
pendulum with delayed feedback control is handled recently by some researches
[255–258].
●
Bifurcation and chaos analysis: Specific bifurcation conditions and chaotic
generators have been verified for the inverted-pendulum systems using several
phenomena. Such phenomena include impacts generally designed by piecewise
linear functions in the related mathematical models [259–261] or delays in control
laws [262–266].
●
Generation and stabilization of self-oscillations: Friction is a very complex
phenomenon that occurs in pendulum systems. When friction effects are not
modeled, feedback controllers may fail in real-time experiments. In most research
works, the pendulum system was studied assuming that the only kind of friction
is viscous friction, whereas a more accurate model of the friction should also
include static and Coulomb (sliding) friction. Indeed, it was proven in [267] that
it is always possible to obtain stable oscillations for the inverted-pendulum models
associated to a limit cycle when such phenomena occur. Such dynamics may also
bear through a supercritical Poincaré–Andronov–Hopf bifurcation induced by
time delays in control variables [264]. Orbital stabilization of pendulum systems
can also induce a periodic reference orbit in finite time [268–271]. Generation
and stabilization of self-oscillations in presence of external perturbations and
uncertainties are proposed in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively.

Major accomplishments in robotics
In robotics, inverted-pendulum systems are mainly used in three directions: (1) testing
emerging control laws of the complex class of under-actuated mechanical systems,
(2) designing and controlling wheeled self-balancing robots and (3) modeling and
controlling walking pattern generation for bipedal and humanoid robots.
1.5.1
Modeling and controlling under-actuated mechanical systems
All inverted-pendulum models presented in this survey paper belong to the class of
underactuated mechanical systems. A mechanical system is said to be under-actuated
when it have fewer independent inputs than generalized coordinates to be controlled
and have then unactuated degrees of freedom [85,261,264]. Because the number of
inputs is less than the number of degrees of freedom, the controllability of the mechan-
ical under-actuated system is not always satisfied, geometric properties of the system
are lost and the system is therefore not linearizable. For such systems, the unactuated
generalized coordinates may be controlled by the actuated coordinates through the
dynamic coupling. This coupling is often inherently nonlinear, resulting in gener-
ally nonintegrable dynamic constraints and therefore second-order nonholonomic
[272–275]. The study of such dynamical systems is much more difficult than it
appears, and pendulum models are widely used to test different emerging control

approaches proposed to control this class of systems so important in many applica-
tions [276–281]. In this book, Chapters 5–9 are devoted to solve control problems for
such class of systems.
1.5.2
Self-balanced mobile-wheeled robots
Mobile robots are more and more omnipresent today. They are used in a diversity of
applications including transport and entertainment. Especially, wheeled robots have
a simpler mechanical structure than legged robots and are known to be energy effi-
cient. Wheeled inverted pendulum devices are self-balancing robots that are statically
unstable variety. They have generally two coaxial wheels mounted on either side of
an intermediate body, with a center of mass above the wheel axes. Their particular
configuration makes them highly maneuverable to hang around and quite suitable
for indoor environments. Furthermore, they have the ability to maintain stability on
inclines, by leaning into the slope and can accelerate quickly without tipping over.
Nowadays, several well-known devices belong to the class of wheeled inverted pen-
dulums. The most famous ones are the Segway [282,283], the JOE [284], the UW-car
[285], the PMP [286], the B2 [287], the I-Pentar [288], a self-balancing humanoid
robot, the Balbot [289] with a single-wheel moving robot in any direction and the
ball-driven balancing robot [290], a mobile robot mounted on a moving ball. Exam-
ples of mobile platforms are found in Chapters 9, 10 and 14. Such devices must
actively stabilize themselves to prevent overbalancing. Although they are more dif-
ficult to control than statically stable wheeled robots, they are still much easier to
control than legged robots. Control law design for tracking trajectories in presence of
any disturbances and uncertainties remain until now a challenging problem for such
devices [291].
1.5.3
Modeling and controlling walking pattern generation
Unlike wheeled robots, legged robots are able to step over obstacles. However, they
are more complex to model and stabilize during a walking cycle due to the greater
number of degrees of freedom and the impact contact force with the ground, see
bipedal robot model given in Chapter 11.
Based on the inverted-pendulum principle stabilization analogy with the human
gait pattern, a number of inverted-pendulum models are used as walking pattern
generation for humanoid robots. The most well-known models are the 3D linear
inverted-pendulum models (LIPM) [292], the Kajita cart-table model [293], the vari-
able impedance LIPM [294], the spring-loaded inverted pendulum [295] and the
angular momentum pendulum model [296]. The most well-known humanoid robots
using LIPM principles are the famous Japanese Honda femaleAndroid HRP-4C [297]
and WABIAN-2R Humanoid robot [298,299]. Such models are also extensively used,
in medicine, to find solutions for walking pattern generation impairments of elderly
and stroked patients [300].

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
1.6
Conclusion
Control methods and technologies arising from the model of the inverted pendulums
attribute to the applications to both biological and mechanical control problems such
stabilizing walking pattern generation and self-balancing wheeled transporters. By
means of the rich properties of the inverted pendulum, this system will continue to
play an important role in detecting abilities of innovative control methods dealing with
nonlinearities, delays, bifurcations, chaos, minimumphasedynamics, oscillationsand
limit cycles, uncertainties and so on.

Chapter 2
State estimation and parameter identification
via sliding-mode techniques:
pendulum–cart system
Diego Gutiérrez1 and Héctor Ríos2
In this chapter, the problems of state estimation and parameter identification for the
pendulum–cart system are addressed. Different high-order sliding-modes techniques
are applied for such a mechanical system. The mathematical model is studied and
a couple of high-order sliding-modes observers are proposed to estimate the state,
in spite of disturbances; exactly and in a finite or fixed time, respectively. Then,
using the exact state estimation, two parameter identification algorithms based on
sliding-modes techniques are introduced to identify the unknown parameters of the
system, i.e. thefrictioncoefficients. Someexperimentsandcomparisonsarepresented
to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms. Finally, some concluding
remarks are given at the end of the chapter.
2.1
Introduction
The state-estimation problem is one of the most important problems in control theory.
There exist many kinds of observers in the literature like adaptive observers, dissipa-
tive observers, high-gain observers, sampled-data observers, interval observers, etc.
Some of these are the sliding-modes-based observers, which have been successfully
developed in the last decades (see, e.g. [1–3]) presenting finite-time convergence and
insensitivity, more than just robustness, to some classes of disturbances.
The first results used first-order sliding-modes (FOSM) output injections (see,
e.g. [4,5]), and to guarantee asymptotic convergence of the estimation error, they
assumed that the system was minimum phase and relative degree one with respect to
the unknown input. Later on, an output linear injection term was added to the FOSM
output injection improving the numerical issues (see, e.g. [6,7]), providing, based on
the same assumptions, asymptotic convergence of the estimation error. Nevertheless,

these assumptions limited the applicability of the proposed observers since they are
not satisfied even for mechanical systems.
Afterwards, high-order sliding-modes (HOSM) observers were introduced based
on strong observability and detectability conditions [8]. Such observers relaxed the
condition related to the relative degree and ensure exact and finite-time state estima-
tion (see, e.g. [9–13]). Continuous finite-time observers have been proposed based
on homogeneity in [14–17]; and based on the implicit Lyapunov function theorem, a
constructive homogeneous observer is proposed in [18]. These continuous observers
provide exact and finite-time state estimation in absence of unknown inputs and
uncertainties. Recently, the concept of fixed-time convergence, or uniform conver-
gence with respect to the initial conditions, has been introduced by [19]. This property
implies the existence of a bound for the convergence time, and such a bound is inde-
pendent of the initial estimation error. There exist a couple of works related to this
property and given in the differentiation framework: the given by [20] for the design of
afirst-orderuniformrobustexactdifferentiator, andthatonein[21] forarbitraryorder.
Regarding the parameter identification problem, it has been extensively studied
during the last decades. One of the more important reasons is the need for accurate
and efficient control for systems.The challenge of providing better models of physical
phenomena leads to that the parameter identification problem becomes fundamental
in industrial applications. System identification techniques are also used in signal
processing applications (such as communications [22], geophysical engineering [23]
and mechanical engineering [24]), in non-technical fields such as biology [25], envi-
ronmental sciences and econometrics to improve the knowledge on the identified
object, prediction and control.
The identification theory basically deals with the problem of the efficient extrac-
tion of signal and system dynamics properties based on available data measurements.
In the literature there exist many methods to identify parameters, and the most popular
ones belong to the group of least squares (LS) methods; for instance, the non-recursive
method of LS, recursive methods of LS, method of weighted LS, exponential forget-
ting with constant forgetting factor, exponential forgetting with variable forgetting
factor, etc. There exist also many modifications of the LS methods; for example,
the method of generalized LS, method of extended LS, method of bias correction,
instrumental variables method; and some others like Bayes method, maximum like-
lihood methods, extended Kalman filter, modulating functions methods, subspaces
methods, etc. (see, e.g. [26–29]).
In the context of finite-time convergence [30], a recursive finite-time convergent
algorithm has been presented in [31]. Such an algorithm is a non-linear recursive
version of the LS algorithm, where the non-linear injection terms, designed based on
the generalized super-twisting algorithm (STA) [32], lead to finite-time convergence.
In this line of research, in [33,34], the filtered equivalent output injection of the
STA together with a standard LS recursive algorithm have been used for parameter
identification of mechanical systems. A finite-time and non-recursive LS algorithm
is presented by [35] to identify constant parameters. Such an algorithm is based on
adaptive control and it requires to solve matrix-valued ordinary differential equations
and to check the invertibility of a matrix (persistence of excitation condition) online.

State estimation and parameter identification via sliding-modes
45
The observation and identification problems have been also studied in different
types of pendulums. In the context of state estimation, in [36], Kalman filters are
introduced to estimate the state of the Virgo inverted pendulum. To estimate the state
of the Furuta pendulum and the wheeled inverted pendulum, some linear observers
have been presented by [37,38], respectively. Some extended high-gain observers have
been implemented in the inertia wheeled pendulum and in the inverted pendulum–
cart by [39,40], respectively. For a mobile wheeled inverted pendulum, in [41,42],
non-linear observers have been proposed to estimate the state or disturbances. On
the other hand, in order to identify the pendulum parameters, in [43], some Kalman
filters are used to identify the dynamic characteristic of the structures equipped with
a pendulum tuned mass damper. For the Furuta pendulum, in [44], a standard LS
algorithm is implemented. Based on a Volterra polynomials, in [45], a non-linear
identification is proposed for the inverted pendulum systems. For the single and
the double pendulum, some parameter identification algorithm based on harmonic
balance-based algorithm are proposed by [46,47], respectively.
In this chapter, the problems of state estimation and parameter identification for
the pendulum–cart system are addressed. A couple of HOSM observers are proposed
to estimate the state, in spite of disturbances; exactly and in a finite or fixed time,
respectively. Based on the exact state estimation, two parameter identification algo-
rithms based on sliding-modes techniques are introduced to identify the unknown
parameters of the system, i.e. the friction coefficients. The corresponding conver-
gence proofs are given based on Lyapunov function approach. Some experiments and
comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms.
The outline of this work is as follows. The problem statement is given in
Section 2.2 and some preliminary results are presented in Section 2.3. The corre-
sponding analysis, design, and robustness properties of the observers are presented
in Section 2.4 and the identification algorithms with the corresponding conditions to
ensure the convergence of the parameters are given in Section 2.5, both of them present
experimental results. Finally, some concluding remarks are discussed in Section 2.6.

Problem statement
Consider the pendulum–cart system depicted in Figure 2.1. This figure describes
a pendulum rotating in a vertical plane around an axis located on a cart. The cart
can move along a horizontal rail, lying in the plane of rotation. The system state is
a vector x = (x1, x2, x3, x4)T, where x1 is the cart position, x2 is the angle between

the upward direction and the pendulum, measured counterclockwise (x2 = 0 for the
upright position of the pendulum), x3 is the cart velocity, and x4 is the pendulum
angular velocity. A control force F, parallel to the rail, is applied to the cart. It is
produced by a DC flat motor controlled by a pulse-width-modulation (PWM) voltage
signal u, and F = p1u. The system control u takes values in the interval [−0.5, 0.5].
The total mass of the pendulum and cart is denoted by m. The distance from the axis
of rotation of the pendulum to the centre of mass of the system is l. The moment of
inertia of the pendulum with respect to its axis on the cart is represented by J. The cart
friction is compound of two forces: the static and the viscous friction proportional to
the cart velocity, fcx3 and fssign(x3), respectively. There is also a friction torque in the
angular motion of the pendulum, proportional to the angular velocity, fpx4 [48].
The system dynamics is described by the following equations:
˙x1 = x3,
(2.1)
˙x2 = x4,
(2.2)
˙x3 = f1(x, u) + ξ1(t, x, u),

˙x4 = f2(x, u) + ξ2(t, x, u),

y = (y1, y2)T = (x1, x2)T,

where the measurable output is given by y ∈R2, the nominal part of the system
dynamics is represented by the functions f1 : R4 × R →R and f2 : R4 × R →R, i.e.

while the uncertainties and perturbations are concentrated in the terms ξ1 and ξ2. The
solutions of the system (2.1)–(2.4) are understood in the Filippov’s sense [49]. It is
assumed that the uncertainties ξ1(t, x, u) and ξ2(t, x, u) are Lebesgue-measurable and
uniformly bounded in any region of the state space x ∈R4, i.e. ∥ξ1(t, x, u)∥∞≤ξ +
1
and ∥ξ2(t, x, u)∥∞≤ξ +
2 , with known positive constants ξ +
1 and ξ +
2 .
The aims of this chapter are to estimate the corresponding velocities, i.e. the
states x3 and x4; and identify the friction parameters1, i.e. fc, fp, and fs; by means of
only the measurable output y and the input u despite the bounded uncertainties ξ1
and ξ2.
The parameters of system (2.1)–(2.4) are given in Table 2.1.

Preliminaries
Let us consider a time-varying differential equation [50]:
dx(t)
dt
= f (t, x(t)),
t ≥t0,
t0 ∈R,
(2.11)
where x(t) ∈Rn is the state vector; f : R≥0 × Rn →Rn is a continuous function with
respect to x and measurable with respect to t, and f (t, 0) = 0. It is assumed that
solution of the system (2.11) for an initial condition x0 ∈Rn at time instant t0 ∈R is
denoted as x(t, t0, x0) and it is defined on some finite time interval [t0, t0 + T) where
0 ≤T < ∞[the notation x(t) will be used to reference x(t, t0, x0) if the origin of x0
and t0 is clear from the context].
Let  be an open subset of Rn, such that 0 ∈.
Definition 2.1. [19],[50],[51]. At the steady state x = 0 the system (2.11) is said
to be:
●
Uniformly stable (US) if for any ε > 0 there is δ(ε) such that for any x0 ∈, if
|x0| ≤δ(ε) then |x(t, t0, x0)| ≤ε for all t ≥t0, for any t0 ∈R.
1It is well known that most of the time the value of the friction coefficients is obtained by means of
experimental evaluation and thus it is difficult to provide an estimation.

48

●
Uniformly asymptotically stable (UAS) if it is US and for any κ > 0 and ε > 0
there exists T(κ, ε) ≥0 such that for any x0 ∈, if |x0| ≤κ then |x(t, t0, x0)| ≤ε
for all t ≥t0 + T(κ, ε), for any t0 ∈R.
●
Uniformly finite-time stable (UFTS) if it is US and finite-time converging from
, i.e. for any x0 ∈ there exists 0 ≤T x0 < +∞such that x(t, t0, x0) = 0 for all
t ≥t0 + T x0, for any t0 ∈R.The function T0(x0) = inf {T x0 ≥0 : x(t, t0, x0) = 0,
∀t ≥t0 + T x0} is called the settling-time of the system (2.11).
●
Uniformly fixed-time stable (UFxTS) if it is UFTS and the settling-time function
T0(x0) is bounded, i.e. ∃Tmax > 0 : T0(x0) ≤Tmax, for all x0 ∈ and for any
t0 ∈R.
If  = Rn, then x = 0 is said to be globally US (GUS), UAS (GUAS), UFTS (GUFTS),
or UFxTS (GUFxTS), respectively.
2.4
High-order sliding-mode observers
In this section, a general HOSM observer is presented to estimate the corresponding
velocities. Then, two particular cases are presented in order to provide finite and
fixed-time convergence of the estimated state to the real one.
The general HOSM observer has the following form:
˙ˆx1 = ˆx3 + k1φ1(ey1),
(2.12)
˙ˆx2 = ˆx4 + k2φ2(ey2),
(2.13)
˙ˆx3 = fn1(ˆx, y, u) + k3φ3(ey1),
(2.14)
˙ˆx4 = fn2(ˆx, y, u) + k4φ4(ey2),
(2.15)
where ey1 := y1 −ˆx1 and ey2 := y2 −ˆx2 are the output errors, the known nominal
functions fn1 : R4 × R4 × R →R and fn2 : R4 × R4 × R →R take the following
structure
fn1(ˆx, y, u) := awn1(ˆx, y, u) + l cos (y2)wn2(y)

(2.16)

and some positive constants ki, μij ≥0 for i = 1, 4 and j = 1, 3. Note that the prop-
erties of the general HOSM observer may change according to the selection of the
parameters μij, i.e.
●
For μi1 = μi3 = 0, i = 1, 4, the observer (2.12)–(2.15) recovers a classic linear
observer.
●
For μi2 = μi3 = 0, i = 1, 4, the observer (2.12)–(2.15) recovers a well-known
non-linear observer, i.e. the super-twisting observer [11].
●
For μi2 = 0, i = 1, 2, the observer (2.12)–(2.15) recovers another non-linear
observer, i.e. the fixed-time observer [20].
Let us define the state estimation error e = (e1, e2, e3, e4)T ∈R4 where ei :=
xi −ˆxi for i = 1, 4. Thus, the error dynamics is given as follows:
˙e1 = e3 −k1φ1(ey1),
(2.24)
˙e2 = e4 −k2φ2(ey2),
(2.25)
˙e3 = F1(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ1(t, x, u) −k3φ3(ey1),
(2.26)
˙e4 = F2(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ2(t, x, u) −k4φ4(ey2).
(2.27)
where F1(x, ˆx, y, u) := f1(x, u) −fn1(ˆx, y, u) and F2(x, ˆx, y, u) := f2(x, u) −fn2(ˆx, y, u).
Duetotheboundednessassumptionovertheuncertaintermsξ1 andξ2, andthestability
properties of the pendulum–cart system2, it is possible to find an upper bound such
that

(2.29)
with known positive constants f +

for i = 1, 2.
In the following, the error dynamics is analysed for two different non-linear
observers, i.e. the super-twisting and the fixed-time observer, respectively.
2.4.1
Super-twisting observer
Consider the general HOSM observer (2.12)–(2.15) for the case in which μi2 = μi3 =
0, and μi1 = 1 for i = 1, 4, i.e. the super-twisting observer [11]:

(2.33)
The following theorem describes the convergence properties of the super-twisting
observer.
Theorem 2.1. [32] Let observer (2.30)–(2.33) be applied to pendulum–cart system
(2.1)–(2.4). If the observer parameters are designed as follows:
k1 > 0, k2 > 0, k3 > 3f +
1 + 2f +
1
k2
1
, k4 > 3f +
2 + 2f +
2

2
,
(2.34)
then the error dynamics is UFTS.
Proof. The error dynamics between pendulum–cart system (2.1)–(2.4) and the super-
twisting observer (2.30)–(2.33) is given as follows:
˙e1 = e3 −k1⌈e1⌋
1

(2.35)
˙e2 = e4 −k2⌈e2⌋

(2.36)
˙e3 = F1(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ1(t, x, u) −k3⌈e1⌋0,
(2.37)
˙e4 = F2(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ2(t, x, u) −k4⌈e2⌋0.
(2.38)
Based on [32], it is possible to show that the function

Recalling that |F1 + ξ1| ≤f +

and |F2 + ξ2| ≤f +

upper bounded as follows
˙V ≤−

(2.47)
Then, ˙V is negative definite if ¯Q1 > 0 and ¯Q2 > 0. Hence, it is easy to show that
this is true if the inequalities (2.34) hold. On the other hand, it follows that
|e1|

(2.48)
where λmin(Pi) is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix Pi. Therefore, ˙V may be
upper bounded as follows
˙V ≤−γ1V

1 −γ2V

2
min(P2)λmin( ¯Q2)

(2.50)
and λmax(Pi) the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix Pi. Thus, since the solution of
the differential equation ˙v ≤−γ v
1
2 , v(0) ≥0, is given by v(t) = (v
1
2 (0) −γ
2 t)2 for
all t ≥0, by the comparison principle [50] one obtains that V(t), and therefore the
error dynamics (2.35)–(2.38), converges to zero at most in a finite time given by
T = 2V
1
2 (e(0))/γ .
2.4.2
Fixed-time observer
Let us consider the general HOSM observer (2.12)–(2.15) with μi1 = 1 for i = 1, 2;
μi1 = 0.5fori = 3, 4; μi2 = 0fori = 1, 2; μi2 = 2α fori = 3, 4; μi3 = α fori = 1, 2;

The following theorem describes the convergence properties of the fixed-time
observer.
Theorem 2.2. [20] Let observer (2.51)–(2.54) be applied to pendulum–cart system
(2.1)–(2.4). If the observer parameters are in the set:

(2.56)
then the error dynamics is UFxTS.
Proof. The error dynamics between pendulum–cart system (2.1)–(2.4) and the fixed-
time observer (2.51)–(2.54) is given as follows:
˙e1 = e3 −k1 ¯φ1(e1),
(2.57)
˙e2 = e4 −k2 ¯φ2(e2),
(2.58)
˙e3 = F1(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ1(t, x, u) −k3 ¯φ3(e1),
(2.59)
˙e4 = F2(x, ˆx, y, u) + ξ2(t, x, u) −k4 ¯φ4(e2).

of the following linear matrix inequalities [20]

, B := [0, 1]T, C := [1, 0],
(2.69)
with ki for i = 1, 4 defined by (2.55)–(2.56), and some ε > 0. Thus, it is possible to
show that
˙V = −γ11V

γ21 :=

, γ22 :=

2λmax(P2).
(2.72)
Therefore, this implies that the trajectories of the error dynamics (2.57)–
(2.60) converge to zero at most in a finite time given by T1 = 2V
1
2 (e(0))/ρ, with
ρ := min(γ11, γ21). Hence, the uniform finite-time stability of the error dynamics is
concluded. To provide the fixed-time convergence, it is needed to prove the uniform
convergence with respect to the initial conditions.
Let us consider the following function
¯V1 = δ
2α2k3|e1|3 −e1 ⌈e3⌋

(2.73)
¯V2 = δ
2α2k4|e2|3 −e2 ⌈e4⌋
4
3 + δ

(2.74)
where δ > 0 sufficiently large. Thus, taking ¯V = ¯V1 + ¯V2, its derivative along the
trajectories of the error dynamics is given by
˙¯V = −1

⎦,
∀¯V1 > ε,
∀¯V2 > ε,
(2.75)
for a sufficient large ε, and some positive constants c1 and c2. Hence, any trajectory of
the error dynamics (2.57)–(2.60) converges to the compact set ε := {e ∈R4| ¯V1 ≤
ε, ¯V2 ≤ε} containing the origin, robustly and uniformly with respect to the initial
error e(0) ∈R4, and the convergence time is upper bounded by a time T2 independent
of the initial error. The estimation of such a time is given in [20].

Real pendulum–cart system
Therefore, combining the two previous properties, i.e. finite-time and uniform
convergence, one can conclude that the error dynamics (2.57)–(2.60) is UFxTS.
Remark 2.1. The detailed convergence proofs for the super-twisting and fixed-time
observers can be seen in [32] and [20], respectively. In this chapter, the proofs
provided for Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 represent just brief sketches. Moreover, the given
results are particularly provided for the pendulum–cart system.
2.4.3
Experimental results
In order to illustrate the workability of the previous HOSM observers, some experi-
ments have been done over the real pendulum–cart system by INTECO and depicted
in Figure 2.2.
The control input u is designed in two steps:
1.
Swing-Up. Based on an algorithm for generation of oscillations, the control
input u is able to take the pendulum from its stable equilibrium point, i.e. x =
[0, π, 0, 0]T, to certain region close to its unstable equilibrium point, i.e. x =
[0, 0, 0, 0]T.
2.
Tracking Control. Once a region around the unstable equilibrium point has been
reached, a PID controller is applied to track the reference r = 0.3 sin(0.05t) for
the cart position and to maintain the pendulum in the upper position.
The super-twisting and the fixed-time observers, described by (2.30)–(2.33) and
(2.51)–(2.54), respectively, are implemented in MATLAB® Simulink®. The para-
meters for both observers were chosen according to the theorems described for each
algorithm and tuned in the experiments to obtain the minimum possible errors; these
parameters are given in Table 2.2.
The experiments have been done on MATLAB Simulink platform over a
RTDAC4/ PCIc data-acquisition board connected to the educational pendulum–cart
system. All the experiments have been implemented with the Euler’s integration
method and with a sampling time equal to 1 × 10−2 s.

The results are presented in Figures 2.3–2.6. It is worth saying that the estimated
positions, i.e. ˆx1 and ˆx2, are compared with the positions provided by a couple of
position encoders given in the pendulum–cart system, while the estimated velocities,
i.e. ˆx3 and ˆx4, are compared with the velocities given by a numerical differentiator
included in the pendulum–cart toolbox. Then, it is easy to see that both observers
have similar performance and they provide very good estimation results.
In order to illustrate the performance of both observers the following index is
implemented:
I =
 1
T
 t
t−T
|e(τ)|2dτ
1/2
,
(2.76)
where e is the state estimation vector and T is a time window width; in the experi-
ment, T was selected as 2. This performance index calculates the Root Mean Square
(RMS) value of the input e.

Performance index of state estimation
The results show that both observers present good results in order to estimate the
pendulum–cart states, but super-twisting observer presents a better performance with
the chosen index and the tuning of the fixed-time observer parameters can be a little
more difficult because it presents more than the super-twisting.

Parameter identification algorithms
A common issue in the control design problem is the lack of knowledge in the para-
meters of the system, for instance, the friction coefficients in mechanical systems;
and even a complete ignorance of them. In order to solve such a problem parameter
identification algorithms are required.
Let us assume that ξ1 = ξ2 = 0, then the pendulum–cart dynamics can be
rewritten in its regressor form as follows [29]:
˙x1 = x3,
(2.77)
˙x2 = x4,
(2.78)
˙x3 = fn1(x, u) + 1(t)θ,
(2.79)
˙x4 = fn2(x, u) + 2(t)θ,
(2.80)
where
fn1(x, u) := awn1(x, u) + l cos(x2)wn2(x)
J + milsin2(x2)
,
fn2(x, u) := l cos(y2)wn1(x, u) + wn2(x)
J + milsin2(x2)
,
(2.81)
wn1(x, u) := p1u −mix2
4 sin(x2), wn2(x) := mig sin(x2),
(2.82)
1(t) :=
−1
J + milsin2(x2) (ax3, asign(x3), lx4 cos(x2)),
(2.83)
2(t) :=
−1
J + milsin2(x2) (l cos(x2)x3, l cos(x2)sign(x3), x4),
(2.84)
θ T := (fc, fs, fp),
(2.85)
whereθ ∈R3 representstheunknownparametervector, andT
1 : R →R3, T
2 : R →
R3 are the regressor vectors. From (2.77) to (2.80), it is easy to see that it is enough
to consider only dynamics (2.79) in order to identify the corresponding parameter
vector θ.
Thus, it is assumed that 1 is bounded, i.e. 0 < α1 = ∥1∥< ∞, and that it is
persistently exciting (PE), i.e. there exist constants α2 > 0 and τ0 > 0 such that
 t+τ0

T
1 (τ)1(τ)dτ ≥α2I,
∀t ≥0.
(2.86)
In the following, two different non-linear identification algorithms are presented
in order to identify the parameter vector θ, i.e. a homogeneous algorithm and a
finite-time algorithm, respectively.

State estimation and parameter identification via sliding-modes
59
2.5.1
Homogeneous algorithm
The homogeneous parameter identification algorithm takes the following form [52]:
˙¯x3 = −¯k1⌈¯e3⌋γ + 1(t) ˆθ + fn1(ˆx, y, u),
(2.87)
˙ˆθ = −¯k2⌈¯e3⌋2γ −11
T(t),
(2.88)
where ¯k1 and ¯k2 are positive gains, ¯e3 := ¯x3 −ˆx3 is a state estimation error where
ˆx3 may be given by the super-twisting or the fixed-time observer; and the parameter
γ ∈(0.5, 1). Note that for the case γ = 1 the algorithm is reduced to the well-known
linear adaptive observer [53].
Define the identification error as ˜θ := ˆθ −θ. Thus, based on homogeneity for
time varying-systems (for more details, see [52,54]), the following theorem describes
the convergence properties of the Homogeneous algorithm.
Theorem 2.3. [52] Let the Homogeneous algorithm (2.87)–(2.88) be applied to the
dynamics (2.79), and the regressor vector 1 be PE. Then for any ¯k1, ¯k2 > 0 and
γ ∈(0.5, 1) the identification error ˜θ is GUAS.
Proof. Define ˜e3 := ¯x3 −x3. Then, the error dynamics is given by
˙˜e3 = −¯k1⌈¯e3⌋γ + 1(t) ˜θ + fn1(ˆx, y, u) −fn1(x, u)
(2.89)
˙˜θ = −¯k2⌈¯e3⌋2γ −11
T(t).
(2.90)
Then, according to the state estimation properties of the super-twisting and the
fixed-time observers described in the previous sections, one can ensure that after a
finite time ˆx3 ≡x3, and thus, this implies that after a finite time ˜e3 ≡¯e3 and also
fn1(ˆx, y, u) ≡fn1(x, u). Therefore, the error dynamics can be rewritten as follows:
˙˜e3 = −¯k1⌈˜e3⌋γ + 1(t) ˜θ
(2.91)
˙˜θ = −¯k2⌈˜e3⌋2γ −11
T(t).
(2.92)
One can show that the system (2.91)–(2.92) is r-homogeneous, in the sense given
by [52], with degree d = γ −1 for the vector of weight (r1, r2, r3, r4) = (1, γ , γ , γ ).
Note that d < 0 for all γ ∈(0.5, 1). Then, based on homogeneity theory one a show
that the system (2.91)–(2.92) is GUAS.
First, note that the system (2.91)–(2.92) can be rewritten as follows:
˙ξ(t) = A(t)ζ(t) + f (t, ˜e3),
(2.93)
where ζ(t) = (˜e3, ˜θ T)T ∈R4, A(t) is a bounded and continuous matrix, for almost all
t ≥0, that is given by

and a positive constant μ; while P(t) is a continuously differentiable, symmetric,
bounded, and positive definite matrix, i.e. 0 < c1I ≤P(t) ≤c2I, for all t ≥0, which
satisfies the following matrix differential equation:
˙P(t) = −P(t)A(t) −AT(t)P(t) −Q(t),
∀t ≥0,
(2.101)
where Q(t) ≥c3I > 0, for all t ≥0, is a continuous, symmetric, and positive definite
matrix; and c1, c2 and c3 are positive constants. The existence of P(t) and Q(t) follows
from the persistence of excitation condition of 1(t).
Let us introduce the following Lyapunov function candidate:
W(t, ˜e3, ˜θ) = W1(˜e3, ˜θ) + W2(t, ζ(t)).
(2.102)
It is possible to show that its derivative along the trajectories of the system (2.91)–
(2.92), for all |˜e3| > 1 satisfies
˙W(t, ˜e3, ˜θ) ≤−η ∥ζ∥,
(2.103)
where η := c3 −(c2/μ). On the other hand, for all |˜e3| ≤1, ˙W satisfies
˙W(t, ˜e3, ˜θ) ≤−η ∥ζ∥+ 2μc2¯k2
2α2
1.
(2.104)
Therefore, uniform stability is concluded for the error dynamics (2.91)–(2.92),
and then by homogeneity, one may conclude that the error dynamics (2.91)–(2.92) is
GUAS [52].

(2.106)
where ¯k1 and ¯k2 are positive gains, ¯e3 = ¯x3 −ˆx3 is a state estimation error with ˆx3
given by the super-twisting or the fixed-time observer.
The following theorem describes the convergence properties of the finite-time
algorithm.
Theorem 2.4. [31] Let the finite-time algorithm (2.105)–(2.106) be applied to the
dynamics (2.79), and the regressor vector 1 be PE. Then for any ¯k1, ¯k2 > 0 the
identification error ˜θ is UFTS.
Proof. The error dynamics is given by
˙˜e3 = −¯k1 ˜φ1(¯e3) + 1(t) ˜θ + fn1(ˆx, y, u) −fn1(x, u)
(2.107)
˙˜θ = −¯k2 ˜φ2(¯e3)1
T(t),
(2.108)
where
˜φ1(¯e3) := ⌈¯e3⌋

(2.109)
˜φ2(¯e3) := 1
2⌈¯e3⌋0 + 3
2⌈¯e3⌋
1
2 + ⌈¯e3⌋1.
(2.110)
Using the same arguments that in the previous proof, for the homogeneous algo-
rithm, one can ensure that after a finite time ˆx3 ≡x3, and thus, after a finite time
˜e3 ≡¯e3 and fn1(ˆx, y, u) ≡fn1(x, u). Hence, the error dynamics can be rewritten as
follows:
˙˜e3 = −¯k1 ˜φ1(˜e3) + 1(t) ˜θ
(2.111)
˙˜θ
= −¯k2 ˜φ2(˜e3)1
T(t).
(2.112)
Let us consider the following Lyapunov function candidate:
V(t, ˜e3, ˜θ) = ζ TP(t)ζ,
(2.113)
where ζ T := ( ˜φ1, ˜θ T), and with P(t) symmetric, bounded, and positive definite matrix,
i.e. 0 < c1I ≤P(t) ≤c2I, for all t ≥0, satisfying

where Q(t) ≥c3I > 0, for all t ≥0, is a symmetric and positive definite matrix. The

on the set S =

, where it is not Lipschitz continuous. The
derivative of V is not well defined for the partial derivative ˜φ′

Note that the previous expression is the derivative of V when the trajectories
of system (2.111)–(2.112), i.e. ϕ(t, t0, ˜e3(t0), ˜θ(t0)), are outside of the set S , and it
indicates that it is negative definite in S c, the complement of S . To stay on the set
S for an interval of time, it is necessary that ˜e3(t) = 0 and 1(t) ˜θ(t) = 0 during
that interval. From the PE condition, it follows that the condition 1(t) ˜θ(t) = 0
cannot be satisfied during any interval t ∈[t, t + T0], such that the trajectories of
system (2.111)–(2.112) cannot stay in the set S for a long time, in fact if the system
has sufficiently excitation, ˜e3(t) crosses zero and does not stay there. Following the
reasoning presented in [32], V is decreasing. It follows from Zubov’s theorem [55]

proofs for Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 are only brief sketches; and the provided results are
particularly given for the pendulum–cart system.

Experimental results
In order to depict the workability of the previous identification algorithms, some
experiments have been done over the same real pendulum–cart system by INTECO.
All the experiments have been implemented with the Euler’s integration method and
with a sampling time equal to 1 × 10−2 s.
The control input u is designed as u = 0.245 sin(3t) in order to excite the system
from the initial position x = [0, π, 0, 0]T. Then, the Homogeneous and the finite-
time algorithms are implemented in MATLAB Simulink. The parameters for both
algorithms were chosen as the observer parameters and are given in Table 2.3.

Conclusions
The problems of state estimation and parameter identification for the pendulum–cart
system have been addressed. Two HOSM observers, i.e. the super-twisting and the
fixed-time, are proposed to estimate the state, in spite of disturbances; exactly and in
a finite or fixed time, respectively. Based on the exact state estimation, two parameter
identification algorithms, i.e. the Homogeneous and the finite-time, based on sliding-
modes techniques are introduced to identify the unknown parameters of the system,
i.e. the friction coefficients. The corresponding convergence proofs have been given
based on Lyapunov function approach. Some experiments and comparisons have
illustrated the effectiveness of the presented algorithms.

Chapter 3
Higher order sliding-mode stabilization
of inverted cart–pendulum
Jesus Mendoza-Avila1 and Ismael Castillo1
Abstract
Stabilization of a cart–pendulum system through a generalized higher order surface-
controller design is presented. The singular Linear Quadratic (LQ) method presents
a natural relationship between order of singularity of a given performance index and
the order of sliding-mode controller. Thus, several arbitrary relative degree optimal
sliding surfaces and its corresponding higher order sliding-mode controller can be
specified for a given system.
Continuous higher order sliding-mode controllers are obtained through a robus-
tification method for arbitrary relative degree nominal controllers based on integral
sliding modes and supertwisting algorithm.
An agreement between the accuracy/complexity of the Continuous Higher Order
Sliding Mode (CHOSM) controller and the limited accuracy offered by the system’s
sensors and actuators is obtained through several experiments.
3.1
Introduction
Sliding-mode control (SMC) is one of the main approaches to stabilize uncertain
nonlinear systems. One of the main features of SMC is the exact compensation of
matched disturbances and the finite-time convergence of the system trajectories to
the sliding surface [1].
The conventional sliding-mode design consists of two steps [1–3]:
1.
Design of a sliding variable.
2.
Sliding-mode control design to enforce the finite-time convergence of system
trajectories to the sliding surface.
One advantage of designing a sliding surface, in the first step, is the reduction of the
system dynamics to the sliding dynamics. This should exhibit a desired behavior [2]

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
and, recently, a desired order of the reduced system specified by the optimization of
a singular performance index [4].
On the other hand, for the second step, higher order sliding modes (HOSM)
controllers have been developed [5,6] in order to ensure the finite-time convergence
of the system state to a sliding surface of relative degree higher than one (closely
related with a higher order of the sliding mode which is indeed the codimension of
the sliding surface).
There are some advantages in the realization of HOSM, for example, when the
controller’s order is equal to the system’s relative degree, the design of the sliding
variable is not necessary and the controller can drive the system’s states to zero in finite
time. Furthermore, HOSM controllers provide the ultimate accuracy and can reduce
the chattering by means of continuous control signal. Nevertheless, the complexity
and computational resources grow exponentially as the order of the HOSM controller.
Also, when a sliding variable is designed, there is no theoretical methodology to find
the precision on the system’s states in spite of the controller order.
In the present chapter, several sliding variables with different relative degrees and
its corresponding HOSM controllers are to be tested in order to find a fair compromise
between the order reduction and order complexity. Accuracy analysis is presented to
show the performance of each case.
3.2
Singular LQ sliding variable design
In [4,7], an extended method to design higher order sliding variables based in optimal
singular LQ stabilization [2] is presented.
Consider the system
˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
(3.1)
x(0) = x0, ∥x0 ∥≤L,
L ∈R+
where A ∈Rn×n is the system state matrix, B ∈Rn is the input matrix, x(t) ∈Rn is the
state vector, u(t) ∈R is the control input. The initial conditions of the system must
be in the set defined by L. Pair (A,B) is supposed controllable.
Besides, consider the cost function singular with respect to the control
J = 1
2
 ∞

xT(t)Qx(t)dt
(3.2)
where Q ∈Rn×n is symmetric and positive semidefinite.
The design algorithm presented in [4] consist of the following steps:
1.
Transformation of the system (3.1) to a controllable canonical form, by means
of a nonsingular transformation T, such that the transformed system is
˙z(t) = ¯Az(t) + ¯Bu(t),
(3.3)
where z = Tx, ¯A = TAT −1, ¯B = TB, and ¯A ∈Rn×n, ¯B ∈Rn×1.

where an, . . . , a1 are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of (3.1).
The weighing matrix Q in the function (3.2) needs to be transformed to keep
its original meaning for the transformed system
¯Q = (T −1)TQT −1
(3.5)
2.
Singularity order of the performance index is defined by means of an analysis of
the weighing matrix ¯Q where the scalar ¯Q22 is looked for.
In higher order case, the matrix ¯Q can only have the form
¯Q =

(3.6)
where ¯Q11 ∈Rn−k−1×n−k−1 is symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, ˜Q22 > 0
and ˜Q22 ∈R.
The singularity order is the number i = k + 1, where k is the number of zero
columns of the weighing matrix ¯Q such that ˜Q22 > 0, ˜Q22 ∈R.
3.
Perform partitions to the system (3.3) according to (3.6). The state vector z is
partitioned in three subsets z = [¯zT
1 ¯zT

3 ]T, where ¯z1 is the sliding mode reduced
dynamics, ¯z2 is a virtual control and ¯z3 the rest of the variables states.
¯z1 = [z1 . . . zn−i]T,
¯z2 = zn−i+1,
(3.7)
¯z3 = [zn−i+2 . . . zn]T.

Continuous higher order sliding-mode controllers
The main idea of HOSM is to design an arbitrary order-sliding variable and keep
it in zero by means of properly chosen HOSM controller. There exist some HOSM
controllers that ensure the convergence to zero of a sliding variable. For example, the
sliding variables of relative degree one can be driven to zero by

˙z = −k3sign(σ),
(3.22)
where k1, k2 and k3 are the controller’s gains and must be properly selected to
achieve the control aim.
The algorithms STA and IDC presented above can compensate Lipschitz disturbances
| ˙φ(x, t) | < C; furthermore, these algorithms generate a continuous signal control
reducing the chattering effect.
There exist some controllers for sliding variables of relative degree greater than
two but in the most of cases those controllers produce discontinuous control signals.
However, there exist the so-called integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) which is
possible inherit the properties of exact compensation of Lipschitz perturbations to
any continuous arbitrary order controller.
3.3.1
Integral sliding-mode control
A way to design a robust control is designing a controller which stabilize the nominal
system, later applying a robustify method such that the final controller can stabi-
lize the system with the same nominal convergence features but in presences of
disturbances [11].
The sliding-mode-based auxiliary controller that compensates the disturbance
from the beginning of the control action, while retaining the order of uncompensated
system, is named integral sliding mode (ISM) controller [12,13].
Using ISMC, it is possible to inherit the SMC’s properties of exact compensation
of disturbances to an arbitrary order nominal controller respecting its convergence
features.
3.3.2
Continuous integral sliding-mode control
In [14], a robustification method for arbitrary order controllers via STA is proposed.
The main advantage of this method is that the robustified control signal is continuous
which reduce significantly the chattering effect.
Considering an arbitrary order dynamic system
˙xi = xi+1
i = 1, 2, . . . , n −1
(3.23)
˙xn = f (x) + g(x)(u + φ(t)),
where x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T is the state vector, u ∈R is the control input, f (x) and g(x)
are smooth state functions representing the nominal and known dynamics. In addi-
tion, 0 < km ≤g(x) ≤kM, φ(t) is a Lipschitz function which represents the matched
disturbances acting on the system.
If for a nominal system (φ(t) = 0) there exists a controller u = u0(x) such that
the close loop system origin is stable, then it is possible to design a sliding variable
and a controller, such that a disturbed system have a robust behavior with respect

Higher order sliding-mode stabilization of inverted cart–pendulum
77
to Lipschitz disturbances, keeping all stability features of the nominal close loop
system [14].
Defining the virtual sliding variable
ϕ(x(t), u0(x(t))) = xn(t) −
 t
0
(f (x(τ)) + g(x(τ))u0(x(τ)))dτ
(3.24)
where x(t) are the system’s trajectories. When σ(x(t), u0(x(t))) = 0, the system
trajectories behave with nominal dynamics, even in presence of disturbances.
To ensure the finite-time convergence to zero of (3.24), a possible control law is
u = u0 + v
(3.25)
where v is an additional control input. The sliding variable dynamics are given by
˙ϕ = g(x)(v + φ(t)).
(3.26)
Note that siding variable has relative degree one, and STA can be implemented
to enforce the system trajectories to zero in finite-time.
Finally, the control law is given by
u = u0 + v
v = −k1r|ϕ|

2 sign(ϕ) + w

˙w = −k2rsign(ϕ)
ϕ = xn(t) −

( f (x(τ)) + g(x(τ))u0(x(τ)))dτ
and stability of the system (3.23) is guaranteed even in presence of Lipschitz matched
disturbances. Stability proof of controller (3.27) is presented in [14].

Cart–pendulum system
The cart–pendulum consists of a pole mounted on a cart in such a way that the pole
can swing freely only on the vertical plane. The cart is driven by a DC flat motor
through a belt. In order to swing and to balance the pole, the cart moves back and
forward on a rail of 2 m of length (see, Figure 3.1) [17].
The cart–pendulum system can show some nontrivial and complex problems of
the control theory as
●
subactuated fourth-order system,
●
nonlinear system,
●
four state variables and one control variable,
●
infinite number of equilibrium points,
●
unstable equilibrium points,
●
the control input is bounded,
●
the cart position is bounded by the rail length [17].
Generally, the cart–pendulum control problem is to bring the pole, as fast as
possible, to one of the unstable equilibrium points and keep it there despite of distur-
bances [17]. In order to design a control law for the cart–pendulum, its mathematical
model is needed.

Continuous higher order sliding-mode controllers:

The steps to implement control schemes based on HOSM consist first in the design
of the sliding variable and later choose an appropriate HOSM controller to ensure the
convergence to the origin.
For the design of sliding variables for the system (3.34), the function (3.18) is
used. An interesting output is given by Ss ∈Rr×n which contain the gain vector of the

Supertwisting algorithm and sliding surface of relative degree one on
cart–pendulum system
The experiments are implemented in a cart–pendulum plant developed by
INTECO [17]. The control law is programmed in MATLAB with Simulink® and the
RTWT (real-time windows target) MathWorks Toolbox is included. Through a data
acquisition card RTDAC4/PCI, the communication between the plant and a computer
is achieved. The control signal is computed by the PC and sent to the DC flat motor
as a PWM signal.
In the experiments, the pendulum is driven near to x0 by means of a swing-
up algorithm which is taken from the test examples of the INTECO cart–pendulum
system [17]. When the pendulum angular position is in a region less than 0.2 (rad), i.e.,
||x2|| < 0.2, the control signal switch to a HOSM controller which stabilize the origin
of the system. The initial conditions are different to zero for all states and the sample
time is 1 ms. When the system is stable in steady state, two perturbations are exercised:
the first one, is a matched perturbation at second 10 of the experiment which consist
of applied force to the cart; the second one is an unmatched perturbation (perturbation
in subactuated dynamics) at second 20 which consist of hit the pendulum. For the
robustified controllers implemented in this work the robustification gains are k1r = 5
and k2r = 5.

Relative degree one SMC
A sliding variable of relative degree one designed for the system (3.34) is given by
σ1 = [200 14 50 1]˜x (see Table 3.2). To drive the system trajectories to the sliding
surface in finite-time, the Supertwisting algorithm (3.21) is used with gains k1 = 20
and k2 = 13. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3.4.
3.5.2

A sliding variable of relative degree two designed for the system (3.34) is given by

surface in finite-time by Integral Discontinuous Control (3.22) with gains k1 = 26,
k2 = 25 and k3 = 10. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3.5.
Another controller which can drive to zero sliding variables of relative degree two
in finite-time is the Robustified second-order Hong’s controller (3.31). In this case,
the sliding variable is given by σ2 = [4.8 0.5 1 0]˜x (see Table 3.2) and the controller
gains are k1 = 4.3, k2 = 120. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3.6.

experimental results are shown in Figure 3.8.
Another choice to stabilize the trajectories of the system in the unstable
equilibrium point x0 is the Robustified LQR controller (3.28) with gains K =
[7.2 42 8.4 7.2]. Note that this algorithm gives exponential convergence to the trajec-
tories of the system but with insensitivity with respect to the matched perturbations.
The experimental results are shown in Figure 3.9.

Results
The experiments show that HOSM controllers can stabilize the unstable equilibrium
point of the system in finite-time (except LQR). Moreover, the controllers provide
insensibility to Lipschitz continuous matched disturbances. A quantitative analysis is
made to determinate that which controller has the best performance with respect to
the accuracy of the sliding variables and states [8].
3.6.1 Accuracy analysis
An accuracy analysis of realized controllers can be done as [8] proposed, let l = [r]
be the maximum integer not exceeding r. If the lth derivative σ(t, x(t, ε)) is uniformly
bounded in ε, for the steady-state part of x(t, ε), then there exist positive constant
C1, C2, . . . , CL−1, such that for the steady-state process the following inequalities
hold
| σ |≤C0τ l, | ˙σ |≤C1τ l−1, | ¨σ |≤C2τ l−2, . . . , | σ l−1 |≤Cl−1τ.
(3.52)
In Table 3.3, it can be seen the accuracy, both in the sliding surface and in the
states, obtained in the experiments realized, the accuracy is measured as the maximum
value when the system is steady state stable.

between ideal behavior and real behavior is shown.
In Figure 3.10, it can be seen that in the experiments STA have less accuracy than

Conclusions
In this chapter, the generalized higher order two-step sliding-mode methodology
to stabilize a cart–pendulum system is implemented. The realization of several
Sliding-Mode variables and controllers allows to find a fair compromise between
the precision-performance and complexity of the controller that theory is not able to
predict.
The sliding variable design is systematically implemented due to the usage of
a MATLAB Toolbox for singular LQ design, while HOSM controllers are built by
means of a robustification method which allows to inherit the exact compensation of
Lipschitz matched perturbations to any arbitrary order nominal controller.
After several experiments, the accuracy analysis shows that the best performance
is achieved in a case of order of singularity between the extreme cases, i.e., for this
fourth-order system, the best performance is achieved in case of order two.
Moreover, it is shown that HOSM technique is a good option to stabilize uncer-
tain nonlinear systems like the cart–pendulum. The exact compensation of matched
disturbances can be appreciated in each experiment.

Chapter 4
Stabilization and tracking control of the inverted
pendulum on a cart via a modified PSO
fractional order PID controller
Haifa Mehdi1 and Olfa Boubaker1
Abstract
In this chapter, a fractional-order proportional integral derivative controller, PIλDμ,
based super-twisting observer for the cart inverted pendulum system is proposed. The
mathematical model of the underactuated robotic system is derived using Lagrange
equation and Grunwald–Letnikov fractional calculus with the physical parameters
of a commercial device, the Googol Technology experimental Laboratory. PIλDμ
parameters are optimized using a modified Particle Swarm intelligence optimization
approach with the help of a multiobjective fitness function. A comparative analysis
with the classical Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm shows the superiority of
the proposed approach.
4.1
Introduction
In spite of its simple structure, the inverted pendulum on a cart remains one of the
most difficult and interesting problems in control theory. Such system is an unstable
with highly nonlinear dynamics, a nonminimum phase and an underactuated system,
so thus an excellent benchmark for testing different control algorithms. Nevertheless,
many standard techniques in control theory are ineffective when tested on the cart
inverted pendulum for many reasons [1]. For example, many geometric properties
of the system are lost when the pendulum moves through horizontal positions [2].
Moreover, the output-zeroing manifold does not contain any equilibrium points, the
relative degree of the system is not constant and the controllability distribution of the
system does not have a constant rank. The system is therefore not linearizable [3].
On the other hand, the control problem of the inverted pendulum system can
be broadly divided into three sections, swing-up control, stabilization and tracking
control. Swing up control is basically used to swing the pendulum rod from pending

position to stabilization zone. Then, stabilization control is essential to uphold it
around the unstable equilibrium point, in upright position, for long interval [4]. So,
finding a controller that can render the vertical upward position of the pendulum
globally asymptotically stable has been considered a major problem.
Inliterature, therearemanywaystobringthependulumtotheupperhalfplane[5].
One of the most popular is based on energy control [6,7]. Moreover, there are sev-
eral different techniques accessible for stabilization and tracking control of inverted
pendulum system [8–10]. One of the most used is proportional integral derivative
(PID) controller. In fact, PID control is still the most broadly used strategies in the
industry to control various real-world processes because of the design simplicity
and implementation [11]. Nevertheless, in traditional PID control, there are some
limitations. For example, it is a well-known fact that conventional PID controllers
cannot effectively control high-order or nonminimum-phase (linear) processes. The
quality of control is not also satisfactory when the process is nonlinear or has large
dead times [11]. So to improve the performances of PID controllers systems, many
researchers have attempted to develop new generations of such compensators. One
of the main interesting suggested methods is the fractional-order PID (FOPID) con-
troller approach proposed by Podlubny [12]. This type of PID controller provides us
with more tuning parameters compared to the conventional one, and consequently,
more control objectives can come into account when it is applied. Fractional-order
calculus is a branch of mathematics which generalizes the conventional integer-order
calculus to arbitrary orders. FOPID control is currently an emerging technology con-
trol with proven performances in numerous applications [13,14]. However, tuning
FOPID controllers is a challenging work since there are more parameters to tune than
the conventional PID. Indeed, five parameters must be tuned, which means two more
parameters than the classical PID controller. More efficient global approach is then
required to optimize these parameters automatically. In recent years, one of the most
interesting evolutionary optimization techniques used to optimize such controllers
for robotic systems is the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [14–17].
The PSO algorithm, introduced by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995 [18], is a
swarm-based metaheuristic technique that models the social behavior of bird flocking.
It is well adapted to the optimization of nonlinear functions in multidimensional space.
PSO is easy to implement and may outperform other evolutionary algorithms [19].
However, it is liable to trap local optimization and cause premature convergence.
On the other hand, the state estimation problem is one of the most important prob-
lems in control theory and for robotic systems. There exist many kinds of observers
in the literature in this framework [16,20–22]. The observation problem has been also
studied in different types of pendulums. In the context of state estimation, in [23]
Kalman filters are introduced to estimate the state of the Virgo inverted pendulum.
To estimate the state of the wheeled inverted pendulum, a velocity estimator and lin-
ear observers have been presented by [24,25]. An extended high-gain observer and
a full-order state observer have been implemented in the inverted pendulum–cart by
Lee et al. [26] and Hashimoto et al. [27].
Motivated by the above discussions, this chapter proposes a FOPID controller
based on the Grunwald–Letnikov (GL) fractional calculus and tuned by a modified

PSO (MPSO) intelligence for stabilization and tracking control of the inverted pen-
dulum system. In addition, the problem of state estimation for the pendulum–cart
system is addressed in spite of disturbances using a super-twisting observer.
The rest of the paper is divided into the following sections. Section 4.2 gives
a description of the inverted pendulum system and derivation of system equations
in state space form. Section 4.3 describes the super-twisting observer, the FOPID-
based controller design and gives details about MPSO algorithm. Section 4.4 gives a
complete description of the control strategy with simulation results and comparative
analysis between proposed MPSO-FOPID controllers and PSO-FOPID controllers
for different scenarios.

The cart-inverted pendulum system
4.2.1
System presentation
Consider the cart inverted pendulum system shown by Figure 4.1. The aim is to move
the cart along the x-direction to a desired point without the pendulum falling. First, we
assume that the pendulum rod is mass-less and that the cart mass and the pendulum
mass are denoted as M and m, respectively. The pendulum rod length is l. There is an
externally x-directed force on the cart, F, a gravity force mg acts on the point mass
at all times and a force of friction Ffric between the cart and the track. The coordinate
system considered is shown in Figure 4.1, where x represents the cart position, and
θ is the tilt angle referenced to the vertically upward direction.
In this chapter, the parameters of the experimental device of the Googol Technol-
ogy Linear single inverted pendulum (GLIP2001) system is considered for simulation
results [28]. The system consists of the following components: the mechanical sys-
tem, the sensors and actuators, the control hardware and the control software. The
block diagram of the setup is shown in Figure 4.2. The system is a single-input and
multiple-output system. The voltage acts as a control input for the system and the
linear cart displacements and angular position of pendulum are the outputs of the
system. Moreover, the mechanical system design, shown in Figure 4.3, consists of
a linear servo motion cart with a freely pivoted pendulum above it, a base, a sliding
shaft, a timing belt, a timing wheel, an optical encoder and a limit switch.

Dynamic modeling
The Lagrange’s equations of the inverted pendulum system are given as follows:
d
dt
∂L
∂˙x

−∂L
∂x = F + Ffric
(4.1)
d
dt
∂L
∂˙θ

∂θ = 0
(4.2)
where L is the Lagrangian defined as
L = 1
2(M + m)˙x2 + 1
2ml2 ˙θ 2 + ml˙x ˙θ cos(θ) −mgl cos(θ)
(4.3)
and Ffric is the force of friction between the cart and the track defined as
Ffric = −b˙x
(4.4)
By putting the expressions (4.3) and (4.4) in (4.1) and (4.2) and after solving it,
Lagrange’s equations of the inverted pendulum system can be expressed as
(M + m)¨x + ml cos(θ) ¨θ −ml ˙θ 2 sin(θ) + b˙x = F
(4.5)
m cos(θ)¨x + ml ¨θ −mg sin(θ) = 0
(4.6)
In the other hand, the experimental setup considered in simulation results uses an AC
servo motor, which is controlled by motion controller card via motor drive amplifier.
So, in order to develop a more realistic dynamic model, the dynamics of AC servo
motor is also taken into account, which is given as
Bm ˙θm = Tm −T
(4.7)
where ˙θm is the rotor velocity displacement. Bm is the viscous-friction coefficient. Tm
and T are the torque generated by a motor and the load torque used to move the cart
through a timing pulley and a synchronous belt, respectively.
The torque generated by a motor can be represented as follow [29]:
Tm = Km

−Kb
Rm
˙θm + u
Rm

(4.8)
where u is the voltage applied to alternating current (AC) servo motor. Km, Kb and Rm
are the torque and back electromotive force (EFM) constant and the motor armature
resistance, respectively.
In this work, we consider a timing pulley and synchronous belt arrangement to
convert rotational motion to translation motion. So the relation between those variable
can be written as
˙x = r ˙θm
(4.9)
where r is the radius of timing pulley.
So the motor torque (4.8) can be written as follows:
Tm = −KmKb
rRm
˙x + Km
Rm
u
(4.10)

and the force acting on the cart is defined as
F = T
r = Km

u −

r2 + KmKb

˙x = αu −β˙x
(4.12)
Finally, by substituting the force given in (4.12) into (4.5), the system equations
describing the cart position dynamics and the pendulum angle dynamics, respectively,
can be described as follows:
¨x = αu + ml ˙θ 2 sin(θ) −mg sin(θ) cos(θ) −(b + β)˙x
(M + m) −m cos2(θ)
(4.13)
¨θ = uα cos(θ) + ml ˙θ 2 sin(θ) cos(θ) −(M + m)g sin(θ) −(b cos(θ) + β)˙x
ml cos2(θ) −(M + m)l
(4.14)
For numerical simulation of the nonlinear model for the inverted pendulum sys-
tem, it is required to represent the nonlinear equations (4.13) and (4.14) into the
standard state space form:
dz
dt = f (t, z, u)
(4.15)
Let, z1 = x, z2 = ˙x = ˙z1, z3 = θ, z4 = ˙θ = ˙z3, the system dynamics may be written
as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
˙z1 = z2
˙z2 = f1(t, z, u) + ξ1(t, z, u)
˙z3 = z4
˙z4 = f2(t, z, u) + ξ2(t, z, u)
(4.16)
and the measurable output is given by
y = (y1, y2)T = (z1, z3)T
(4.17)
where the nominal part of the system dynamics is represented by the functions:
f1(t, z, u) = αu + mlz2
4 sin(z3) −mg sin(z3) cos(z3) −(b + β)z2
(M + m) −m cos2(z3)
(4.18)
f2(t, z, u)
= uα cos(z3) + mlz2
4 sin(z3) cos(z3) −(M + m) g sin(z3) −(b cos(z3) + β)z2
ml cos2(z3) −(M + m)l
(4.19)
while the uncertainties are concentrated in the terms ξ1(t, z, u) and ξ2(t, z, u). For the
case study of system (4.16) and for i = 1, 2, fi(t, z, u) and ξi(t, z, u) are Lebesgue-
measurable and uniformly bounded in any region of the state space.

Control system
4.3.1
Super-twisting observer
For the Googol-inverted pendulum experimental setup, only the cart position, x, and
the pendulum angle, θ, are directly measured. This means that the cart velocity and
the pendulum angular velocity are not immediately available for use in any control
schemes beyond just stabilization. Thus, an observer is relied upon to supply accurate
estimation of the states at all cart–pendulum positions.
In [30], Davila et al. proposed a super-twisting observer which reconstructs
for second-order mechanical systems the velocity from the position measurements
with finite time convergence using the principle of the second-order sliding-mode
presented in [31]. It is shown that the separation principle theorem is trivial in this case,
and the observer can be designed separately from the controller. Thus, if the controller
is known to stabilize the process, then the stabilization of the system in closed-loop is
assured whenever the super-twisting observer dynamics are fast enough. Furthermore,
not only stabilization problem can be achieved but also tracking problem since the
time variable is explicit in the observer model [32–34]. Only partial knowledge of the
system model is required in such a case.

4.3.2
Fractional controller
4.3.2.1
Fractional order calculus
Fractional-order integration and differentiation are the generalization of the integer-
order ones to a real or complex order. Efforts to extend the specific definitions of the
traditional integer-order to the more general arbitrary order context led to different
definitions for fractional derivatives [35]. Fractional calculus is also three centuries
old as is conventional calculus, but is not very popular in the research field. However,
since the last few decades, many researchers have done work in different areas of
science and engineering (control system, modeling, etc.) using fractional calculus
[36,37].
The real order generalization is as follows:
Dα =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
dα
dtα
if α > 0
1
if α = 0
 t
0
dτ −α
if α < 0
(4.25)
There are many definitions of fractional calculus but the three most frequently used
definitions are Riemann–Liouville (RL), Caputo and GL [38]. The first one is Caputo
witch expression is given by
aDα
t f (t) =
1

(n −α)
 t

f (n)(τ)
(t −τ)α−n+1 dτ
(4.26)
where α is a real number, a and t are the limits of operator, n is the integer value which
satisfies the condition n −1 < α < n and 
 is the Gamma function defined by

(z) =
 ∞
0
tz−1e−tdt
(4.27)
The Caputo definition is popular mostly in engineering applications [39], as it directly
connection between the type of the initial conditions and the type of the fractional
derivative.
The second definition is the RL given as
aDα
t f (t) =
1

(n −α)
 d

n  t

f (τ)
(t −τ)α−n+1 dτ
(4.28)
The RL definition for the fractional integral and derivative is appropriate for finding
the analytical solution of simple functions like cos(t), et [40].

Stabilization and tracking control of inverted pendulum on a cart

The Caputo and RL formulation have the same view when the initial conditions
are zero.
The third definition is GL given by

(4.29)
The GL definition is used for numerical evaluations. This definition is very beneficial
in obtaining a numerical solution of fractional differential equations [41].
In this work, the GL definition will be used. In such a case, the choice of the
initial conditions doesn’t play an important role in the obtained solutions.
4.3.2.2
Fractional order PID (FOPID) controller
PID controllers have been used for several decades in industries for process control
applications [42]. The reason for their popularity is in the simplicity of its design
and good performance [42]. A FOPID controller is an extension of the classical PID
controller in which the introduction of two extra parameters λ and μ makes it complex
as compared to PID controller because of introduction of fractional calculus in it.
The control signal u(t) can then be expressed in the time domain as
u(t) = kpe(t) + kiD−λe(t) + kdDμe(t)
(4.30)
where e(t) is the error signal. kp, ki and kd are proportional, integral and derivative
gains, respectively. λ is the order of integration and μ is the order of differentiator.
In the Laplace domain, assuming zero initial conditions, the FOPID controller
has the following form:
C(s) = kp + ki
sλ + kdsμ
(4.31)
All the classical PID controllers are particular cases of the fractional controller:
●
if λ = 1 and μ = 1, then it is classical PID controller.
●
if λ = 0 and μ = 1, then it is classical PD controller.
●
if λ = 1 and μ = 0, then it is classical PI controller.
●
if λ = 0 and μ = 0, then it is classical P controller.
A FOPID controller works better in the following situations/applications [43]:
●
Five different specifications can be achieved, which is not possible in the case of
classical PID controller.
●
The FOPID controller can easily attain the property of iso-damping, compared to
classical PID controller.
●
For higher order systems, the performance of classical PID controller deteriorates,
whereas FOPID controller provides better results.
●
For a system with long time delay, a FOPID controller provides better results than
classical PID controller.
●
A classical PID controller provides lower robust stability, whereas FOPID
controller has more robust and stable.

102
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
●
It is difficult to control the system with nonlinearities using classical PID
controller, whereas the FOPID controller can perform better.
●
The FOPID controller can achieve better response for nonminimum phase system.
●
Mostly, nonlinearsystemislinearizedatdifferentoperatingpoints, andcontrollers
are designed for different operating points, whereas one FOPID controller is
mostly sufficient for nonlinear system.
The fractional controllers have two parameters more than the conventional PID con-
trollers, thus two more specifications can be met, which improves the performance
of the overall system. It can be expected that the FOPID controller may enhance the
performance of the system. So, finding an optimal set of values for kp, ki, kd, λ and μ
in order to meet the user specifications for a given process needs parameter optimiza-
tion in five-dimensional hyperspace witch remain a complex and time consuming
procedure [44]. For those reasons, researchers have used different methods of tuning
like Ziegler–Nichols modified method, PSO, neural network, etc. [45,46].
4.3.3 Tuning parameters of fractional-order controller
Tuning controllers is always a challenging task. In case of FOPID controllers, there
are five parameters to tune. Because of a larger number of parameters, it is chal-
lenging to tune this controller [47]. Various methods are used for tuning of fractional
order controllers (Rule-based methods, analytical methods, numerical methods, etc.)
[48–50]. In this work, we will use one of the soft computing methods: the PSO
approach. Indeed, PSO has been regarded widely as a promising optimization
algorithm due to its combination of simplicity, low computational cost and good per-
formance. In the other hand, the optimal problems solved by genetic algorithms can
obtain better solutions with PSO in comparison with conventional methods [51]. How-
ever, the classic PSO algorithm has a major problem which is premature convergence.
So, to address this problem, we will use in this work the MPSO proposed by Zhao
et al. [52]. In fact, PSO method was used for designing fractional order controllers by
Cao and Cao [53]. The optimization performance target is the weighted combination
of ITAE and control input. Hu et al. [54] have also used the PSO algorithm for tuning
of the FOPID implemented with FPGA.
4.3.3.1
Particle swarm optimization
The PSO method is an evolutionary algorithm inspired from study on swarm such as
fish schooling and bird flocking [18]. During flight, each particle adjusts its position
according to its own experience, and the experience of other particles, making use
of the best position encounter by itself and its neighbors. The swarm direction of a
particle is defined by the position of particles adjacent to the particle and its history.
The best previous position of ith particle is recorded and represented as pbesti. The
best particle among all the particles in the group is represented as gbest.
The PSO concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity (or accel-
eration) of each particle i toward its pbest and the gbest position. For the ith particle,
a new velocity and position are updated such that [19]:

4.3.3.2
Modified particle swarm optimization
The classic PSO algorithm has a major problem which is premature convergence.This
problem incurs a rapid loss of diversity during the evolutionary processing. Therefore,
to address this problem, Zhao et al. [52] propose a MPSO, which adopts an adaptive
factorfa topreventprematureconvergenceandaperturbationoperatorga helpparticles
flight from local optima.
The adaptive factor is defined as follows:
fa = rand ×

1 −k
N

(4.35)
where rand meets normal distribution within the range [0, 1]. Equation (4.35) means
that the adaptive factor fa tends to decrease with the iterations k. By introducing fa,
the position of particle (4.33) is modified as follows:
p(k+1)
i
= p(k)
i
+ fa × V (k+1)
i
= p(k)
i
+ rand ×

1 −k
N

× V (k+1)
i
(4.36)
It can be seen in relation (4.36) that in the beginning stage of the iteration fa is large,
and the algorithm has strong ability to explore new areas continuously to overcome
premature convergence, then as the number of iteration increases, fa decreases, thus
the algorithm converges gradually and can search finely around the optimal solution.
The adaptive factor fa balances the global and local search capability.
In PSO, the global best location gbest steers the flight direction for a parti-
cle, so it would be more effective to modify gbest to maintain particles diversity
for jumping out of the potential local optima by using a perturbation operator ga.
So, to better manage diversity and convergence, the perturbation range of gbest is
limited to
 0 max( p) −min( p) 
. max( p) −min( p) is the difference of maximum
and minimum location of particles in different iteration. At the beginning of the
iteration, max( p) −min( p) is large, and the extensive perturbation range keeps the
diversity of particles. Then as the number of iteration increases, max( p) −min( p)
decreases gradually, the lower perturbation rate can converges gradually and search

finely around the optimal solution. So the best particle among all the particles in the
group gbest with perturbation operator ga will be defined as
gbest(k+1) = gbest(k) + ga
= gbest(k) +

(4.37)
The design steps for implementing the MPSO algorithm are given as follows:
1.
Initialize a population of particles with arbitrary positions and velocities.
2.
Update the inertial weight w.
3.
For each particle, estimate the desired optimization fitness function.
4.
Compare particle’s fitness with its pbesti. If present value is better than pbesti,
then put pbesti equal to the recent value.
5.
Update the velocity and position of the particle according to (4.32) and (4.36),
respectively.
6.
Identify the particle in the area with the best success so far, and allocate it to
gbest.
7.
If the maximum number of iterations is not reached, perturb the global best
location to take new gbest as the global best location by using (4.37).
8.
If a criterion is meet (a sufficiently good fitness or a maximum number of
iterations), go to 9 else go to 2.
9.
The particle that generates the latest gbest is an optimal controller parameter.
4.3.3.3
Fitness function
For getting good dynamic performance and avoiding large control input, the following
fitness function is used in this paper:
J =
 T
0

w1 ×

[θd(t) −θ(t)]T[θd(t) −θ(t)] + w2
×

[xd(t) −x(t)]T[xd(t) −x(t)] + w3 × u(t)

dt
(4.38)
where w1, w2 and w3 are the weights to give equal weightage to all parameters. T is
the simulation time. The fitness function given by (4.38) has three terms. The first
term is the integral square of pendulum angle error θd(t) −θ(t) which is used to
stabilize pendulum angle. The second term is the integral square of cart position error
xd(t) −x(t) which is used to track cart position. Finally, the third term is the integral
square of control input u(t) which is used to minimize the required control voltage.

Uncertainties are defined as external perturbations satisfying |ξi(t, z, u)| < 1.
They were taken as ξ1 = ξ2 = 0.03 sin(20t). In the other hand, to explore the per-
formances of the proposed control approach, we consider two case studies for
simulation:
Case study 1:The control input is designed to track a smooth profile for the cart
position reference given by xd = 0.3 sin(0.1t) and, to stabilize the pendulum in its
upper position (θd = 0).
Case study 2: The control is designed to track a nonsmooth trajectory for the
cart position reference given by xd = 0.3 sin(0.1t) and, to stabilize the pendulum in
its upper position.

Figure 4.4 illustrates the block diagram of optimal design of the FOPID-
controller-based super-twisting observer for the inverted pendulum on a cart using
MPSO algorithm.
The MPSO and PSO algorithm’s parameters are given in Table 4.2. The para-
meters of the fitness function (5) are chosen as w1 = 1, w2 = 1 and w3 = 0.1. The
initial conditions are taken as follows: x = z1 = ˆz1 = 0.3 m, ˙x = z2 = −0.1 m/s,
ˆz2 = 0 m/s, θ = z3 = ˆz3 = 0.2 rad, ˙θ = z4 = 0.03 rad/s and ˆz4 = 0 rad/s.
In the other hand, assume that |z1|,

|z3|,

Therefore, the observer parameters described by (4.21) are chosen as κ1 = 2, σ1 = 5,
κ2 = 1 and σ2 = 3.

Figures 4.5–4.8 show the MPSO-FOPID response compared to the PSO-FOPID
response for the system under consideration with the objective of controlling the
cart position and stabilizing the pendulum angle. From Figure 4.5, we may conclude
that there is some oscillations and large settling time for the PSO-FOPID controller
regarding the cart’s position. Such dynamics are not observed when using the MPSO-
FOPID controller. In the other hand, Figure 4.6 shows that cart position error is
null after 20 s in the two cases. From Figure 4.7, we can observe oscillations for
pendulum’s angle when the PSO-FOPID controller is used compared to the MPSO-
FOPID controller. In Figure 4.8, both PSO and MPSO FOPID controller provide
acceptable control laws but in case of MPSO-FOPID, less control effort is required.

The desired and actual cart trajectories are shown in Figure 4.9. We can conclude
that settling time is large for PSO-FOPID controller compared to MPSO-FOPID
controller when desired trajectory cart is nonsmooth. From Figure 4.10, we also
observe oscillations when parameters of FOPID controller are tuned using PSO algo-
rithm. From Figure 4.11, we can conclude that the profile of the control laws present
some oscillations during the deviation of the cart. Furthermore, more overshoots are

Conclusion
In this chapter, an MPSO-FOPID-controller-based super-twisting observer is applied
for the inverted pendulum on a cart system with the consideration of optimization
objectives.Thesuper-twistingobserverisproposedtoestimatethestatevector, inspite
of disturbance, exactly and in a finite time. The MPSO algorithm that adopts adaptive
factor and perturbation operator conquers the drawback of premature convergence of
PSO method, has been improved and applied for simultaneous optimization of several
parameters of the controllers. Performances of MPSO-FOPID and PSO-FOPID con-
trollers are studied and compared. Analysis confirms the stability and robustness of
the proposed FOPID controller in terms of tracking errors in the case of a smooth or a
nonsmooth cart trajectory. The chapter has also shown that MPSO-FOPID gives more
flexibility for the control system designing and has better opportunity to adjust system

dynamic characteristics, which means that the proposed controller design technique
may serve as an efficient alternative for the design of future controllers. The per-
formance investigation of the FOPID control approach using MPSO with a different
multiobjective fitness function including linear and angular velocity variables may
be done as a future work.

Model-free control of the inertia wheel inverted
pendulum with real-time experiments
Ahmed Chemori1
5.1
Introduction
The inertia wheel inverted pendulum belongs to the class of underactuated mechan-
ical systems [10,12,22]. These systems are characterized by less control inputs than
degrees of freedom, meaning that they have at least one unactuated generalized
coordinate. Underactuation in these systems has two main sources, the first one
is intentionally, i.e., decided in the design stage to minimize the cost, the weight,
consumption, etc. The second is nonintentionally, where a fully actuated mechani-
cal system can become underactuated after the deficiency of one or more actuators.
Underactuated mechanical systems are characterized by a high nonlinear coupling
between actuated and unactuated coordinates [7], and an internal dynamics which is
often unstable (i.e., nonminimum phase systems [2]). In the real world many exam-
ples of such systems exist, they include, among others, inverted pendulums [18,21],
underactuated robot manipulators [6], gymnast robots [23,31], undersea vehicles [17],
aircrafts [26] and some mobile robots [20].
The inertia wheel inverted pendulum [34] is a benchmark for nonlinear control of
underactuated mechanical systems. It has attracted the attention of many researchers
within control community. Indeed, different control solutions have been proposed in
the literature these last decades. In [1], strong damping force on the inertia wheel is
taken into account in the design of the controller. The stabilization is achieved via
nested saturation based controller. Reference [19] solves the limit cycles generation
problem on the inertia wheel pendulum using virtual holonomic constraints. Real-
time experiments were carried out showing the robustness of the proposed approach.
In [27], collocated partial feedback linearization was performed to exhibit the non-
linear core subsystem which is stabilized using an implicit control. The remaining
subsystem is stabilized using multiple sliding mode control technique. In our previ-
ous work [4,5], noncollocated partial feedback linearization is used; this gives rise to
an unstable internal dynamics, which is stabilized using trajectory optimization and
model-based error estimation. In [36], a generalized predictive controller is proposed

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
for the stabilization of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum. In [9], the proposed con-
trol solution deals with external disturbance rejection in passivity-based control of the
inertia wheel inverted pendulum. All the above-mentioned techniques require knowl-
edge of the system dynamics and parameters, furthermore only [3,4,9,19,36] present
real-time experiments as a validation on a prototype of the inertia wheel inverted
pendulum.
In this chapter, we propose to design a control scheme based on model-free
technique to deal with underactuation in stable limit cycle generation. In order to
achieve stable limit cycles on both coordinates of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum,
we first design a family of p-parameterized periodic trajectories for the pendulum’s
angle. Those trajectories are then tracked using the control input thanks to a classical
model-free controller [8,15]. Since the system is underactuated and nonminimum
phase, a second controller is needed to update the parameter p of the above trajectories
inordertodealwiththeconvergenceoftheinternaldynamicsofthesystem.Toachieve
this control, we propose a second model-free controller using actuated coordinate
(inertia wheel) as output and trajectories’ parameter p as control input. Note that this
control scheme can be easily applied to the stabilization case by carefully choosing
appropriate trajectories. Numerical simulations as well as real-time experiments are
presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and its ability for
external disturbances rejection.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 5.2, the experimental
platform of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum is presented, with a description of its
main components. Then, the proposed control solution is described in Section 5.3 for
the general case of underactuated mechanical systems. Section 5.4 is devoted to the
application of the proposed control scheme to the case of inertia wheel inverted pen-
dulum. Numerical simulations are introduced in Section 5.5, where a first validation
of the proposed control solution is illustrated. In Section 5.6, real-time experimental
results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section 5.7 is devoted to some concluding
remarks.

The testbed of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum system is shown in Figure 5.1,
with its different components. It consists of three main parts:

the electronic part and

the computer (control PC).
These three main parts will be described in the following sections.

The pendulum angle qna (with respect to the vertical) is constrained to remain

Description of the control PC and software
As illustrated in Figure 5.1, the whole system is controlled with a computer equipped
with a 2.4-GHz microprocessor. The control software is implemented using C++ lan-
guage, and the whole system is running under Ardence RTX (Real-Time Extension
for Windows) operating system. The computer is the heart of the control system, it is
connected to the I/O interface card to communicate with the physical system.
5.3
A proposed control solution for underactuated systems
In this section, the proposed control scheme is detailed. The main idea is to develop
a control architecture based on model-free control for tracking of reference periodic
trajectories while keeping stable the internal dynamics of underactuated mechanical
systems.
5.3.1
Brief background on model-free control
Model-free control strategy has been initially proposed in [8,15] resulting in a break-
through in nonlinear control. This technique is based on previous results on fast
estimation and identification of nonlinear signals [16,24]. The control scheme is
based on local linear approximation of the controlled system dynamics which is valid
for a small time window. This approximation is updated in an online fashion thanks to
a fast estimator. The control law proposed consists in a PID controller augmented with
compensating terms provided by online estimation of the system dynamics. The over-
all controller is also called i-PID (standing for intelligent PID). Comparison of such
a controller with classical PID controller can be found in [11]. The main advantage
of this control strategy is that it doesn’t require neither prior knowledge of the system
dynamics nor complex parameters tuning. Consequently, it can be easily applied to
controller unknown systems. Some efforts have been made for two particular cases of
underactuated systems: the ball and beam [14] (where the dynamics of the beam has
not been taken into account) and the Planar Vertical Take Off and Landing (PVTOL)
aircraft [28] where the addressed control problem is limited to stabilization.
For the sake of simplicity, we present in the following model-free control for a
single-input–single-output nonlinear systems.
5.3.1.1
Nonlinear dynamics
Consider a nonlinear system with unknown dynamics. The input–output behavior of
the system can be expressed in the following general form as an ordinary differential
equation (ODE):
E(y, ˙y, . . . , y(a), u, ˙u, . . . , u(b)) = 0
(5.1)

Control of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum with experiments
123
Given that this finite dimensional ODE is smooth enough, it can be approximated for
a short time-window by the following simplified model:
y(ν) = F + αu
(5.2)
The derivation order ν and the constant parameter α ∈R can be arbitrarily chosen
by the designer. In model-free control literature, ν is generally chosen to be 1 or 2.
The nonphysical constant α is a design parameter. F ∈R captures all the unknown
nonlinearities in the input–output behavior and can be compensated in the control
law. Since (5.2) is valid for a short time window, it must be updated at each sample
time. Therefore, the value of F is updated from the measurement of u and y(ν) in the
following manner:
[F(k)]e = [y(ν)(k)]e −αu(k −1)
(5.3)
where [F(k)]e is the estimated value of F at sample time k which will be used for
the computation of the control input u(k). [y(ν)(k)]e is the estimated value of the νth
derivative of the output y at discrete time k and u(k −1) is the control input previously
applied at discrete time k −1. The value of F can be initialized to 0 at initial time
k = 0.
5.3.1.2
The control law
Given numerical knowledge of F (based on estimation) expressed by (5.15), the
control input may cancel the unknown nonlinearities and add compensating terms
corresponding to a closed-loop tracking of a given reference trajectory y∗(t) using
a conventional PID controller resulting in an intelligent-PID (often referred to as
i-PID):
u = 1
α

−F + y∗(ν) + Kpe + Ki

e + Kd ˙e

(5.4)
where y∗(ν) is the νth derivative of the reference trajectory y∗. Kp, Ki, Kd are the PID
feedbackgains, e = y∗−y istheoutputtrackingerror, and ˙e isitsfirsttime-derivative.
The tuning of the PID feedback gains can be performed using poles placement tech-
niques since all nonlinearities are supposed to be canceled. It is no longer necessary to
perform complex system identification [13,14]. If ν = 1, the PID controller reduces
to a PI controller since the first derivative of output ˙y is taken into account in the
estimation of F in (5.15).
5.3.2
Proposed control solution
In our case, we are interested in tracking of periodic reference trajectories for stable
limit cycles generation on underactuated mechanical systems (mainly known as non-
linear and nonminimum phase) and particularly the inertia wheel inverted pendulum.
In order to simplify our presentation of the control problem as well as the proposed
solution, let as focus on 1-input–2-degree-of-freedom underactuated mechanical sys-
tems (these are the minimum dimensions for a system to be underactuated) without

loss of generality. The dynamics of such systems takes the following Lagrangian
matrix form [29,33]:
M(q)¨q + H(q, ˙q) + G(q) = Ru
(5.5)
where M ∈R2×2 is the inertia matrix of the system, q ∈R2 is the vector of generalized
coordinates. ˙q, ¨q ∈R2 are, respectively, their first and second time-derivatives. H ∈
R2 is a vector of centrifugal and Coriolis forces and G ∈R2 is a vector of gravitational
terms. u ∈R is the control input and R ∈R2×1 is a matrix distributing the effects of
u on the generalized coordinates of the system. Consider the following partition q =
[qa, qna]T of the vector of generalized coordinates, where qa is the actuated coordinate
and qna is the unactuated one, then (5.5) may be rewritten as:
m11(q)¨qa + m12(q)¨qna + h1(q, ˙q) + g1(q) = u
(5.6)
m21(q)¨qa + m22(q)¨qna + h2(q, ˙q) + g2(q) = 0

(5.8)
We suppose that the state of the system is the vector [qa qna ˙qa ˙qna]T.
Our goal is to generate stable limit cycles on both actuated and unactuated
coordinates of the underactuated mechanical system described by (5.6) and (5.7).
5.3.2.1
Basic principle of the proposed control scheme
A family of p-parameterized τ-periodic reference trajectories q∗
na(p, τ, t) should be
defined for the unactuated coordinate.Those trajectories should have the same bound-
ary conditions for all p values, allowing the controller to switch from one trajectory to
another while keeping the overall trajectory smooth. Thanks to the dynamic coupling
existing between the actuated and unactuated coordinates of the system, it is possible
to control the unactuated coordinate using the control input u (i.e., the torque on the
actuated coordinate) which allows those trajectories to be tracked on the unactuated
coordinate qna using the control input u.
Indeed, the dynamics (5.6) and (5.7) can be rewritten in a form with a relation
between unactuated coordinate and control input [30]. First, (5.6) is solved for ¨qa1:
¨qa = m−1
11 (−m12¨qna −h1 −g1 + u) .
(5.9)
Injecting this solution in (5.7) leads to:
m2¨qna + h2 + g2 = −m21m−1
11 u
(5.10)
where m2 = m22 −m21m−1
11 m12, h2 = h2 −m21m−1
11 h1 and g2 = g2 −m21m−1
11 g1.
Based on the resulting dynamics (5.10), involving a relationship between ¨qna and
u, a model-free controller can then be designed to perform the tracking of reference
trajectories on unactuated coordinate qna using the control input u. However, since
1For clarity reasons, the dependency in q and ˙q of the involved terms is omitted in the adopted notation.

Schematic view of the proposed dual model-free controller. The
controlled system has as output y and as input u. The reference output
trajectories y∗are generated given a parameter p, and tracked by the
first model-free controller (called also tracking controller) based on the
evaluation of the error e = y∗−y. The parameter p is updated at each
period by the second model-free controller (called also stabilizing
controller)
the internal dynamics of the system is unstable (the inertia wheel is a nonminimum
phase underactuated mechanical system), even a perfect tracking of these trajectories
cannot guarantee the stability of the internal dynamics of the system (i.e., the inertia
wheel dynamics). Consequently, a second controller is needed to manage the stability
of the system’s internal dynamics.
Indeed, the closed-loop system dynamics can be obtained by substituting u in
(5.6) by its value taken from (5.7). This requires the invertibility of −m21m−1
11 and
particularly of m21. This invertibility constraint is also known as Strong Inertial
Coupling [35]. The resulting internal dynamics is then the following:
¨qa + m−1
12 m22¨qna + m−1
12 h2 + m−1
12 g2 = 0.
(5.11)
Note that ¨qna depends on the control input u and therefore on the reference parameter-
ized trajectory and its design parameter p. This second controller therefore will acts
on the reference trajectory’s parameter p (this parameter is considered as the control
input to be generated by this second controller) in the aim of keeping the stability
of the internal dynamics of the system (i.e., the actuated coordinate is considered
as the output to be controlled). In other words, a periodic parameterized reference
trajectory is tracked on the unactuated coordinate by the first controller, and at the end
of each period, the second controller chooses the new trajectory parameter p in order
to stabilize the actuated coordinate. The chosen parameter p is used in the reference
trajectory of the forthcoming cycle. The overall control scheme is illustrated in the
block-diagram of Figure 5.3.

all, they have to be continuous, time-derivable and periodic in order to generate limit
cycles. This consideration leads to design oscillatory shaped trajectories which are
split up in half period, where we will use symmetry to generate the whole cycle. The
parametrization of these trajectories must allow the controller to update the parameter
p (which corresponds to the time at which the trajectory q∗
na crosses zero) during
tracking, while the overall trajectory remains smooth. This leads to some initial and
final conditions of each half period part. That is for a given period τ and amplitude

for some domain P ⊂R (chosen to keep an oscillatory shape). We propose to use a
six-degree polynomial function parameterized with p such that:
∀p ∈P, q∗
na(p, τ, t = p) = 0
(5.13)
Figure 5.4 shows normalized reference trajectories (for τ = 2 and A = 1) for different
values of the parameter p during half a period. The domain P is restricted to interval
[pmin, pmax] guaranteeing an oscillatory shape trajectory. It is worth to note, due to
the symmetry property of half period trajectory parts, pmin = 1 −pmax.

nonlinear dynamics (5.10) to be replaced by a local model according to model-free
control principle:
¨qna = F1 + α1u
(5.14)
where the constant parameter α1 is a control design parameter.The term F1 is supposed
to capture the nonlinearities in the unactuated coordinate dynamics and is updated at
each sample time according to the following equation:
[F1(k)]e = [¨qna(k)]e −α1u(k −1)
(5.15)
where the notation [.]e states for the estimated value.
The tracking controller is obtained using numerically computed value of F1 in
(5.15) using the first model-free controller (i-PID) as follows:
u = 1
α1

−F1 + ¨q∗
na(p, τ, t) + Kp1e + Ki1


(5.16)
where the feedback gains Kp1, Ki1, Kd1 can be chosen using poles placement technique
based on the assumption that the system’s nonlinearities are compensated by the
term F1. The unactuated coordinate qna should follow therefore the desired periodic
trajectory q∗
na(p, τ, t).
The parameter p, in the tracking control input (5.16), is constant over half a
period, i.e., ∀t ∈[k τ
2 (k + 1) τ
2], k ∈N and is updated at the end of each half period,
i.e., at time k τ
2, k ∈N by a second model-free controller to be designed.
For that purpose, let us consider now the dynamics of the actuated coordinate of
the system. This dynamics may be approximated by the following local discrete-time
model:
τva = F2 + α2p
(5.17)
where τva = ˙qa(k τ
2) −˙qa((k −1) τ
2) is the variation of the velocity of the actuated
joint (inertia wheel) va = ˙qa measured between half periods and the constant α2 is
a control design parameter. According the basic principle of model-free control the
value of F2 is updated at the end of each half cycle (t = k τ
2 for k ∈N) as follows:

(5.18)
Note that continuous dynamics of the actuated coordinate within the half cycle t =
[k τ
2 (k + 1) τ
2] is not taken into account in this local model. The idea is that we only
aim at limit cycle generation on this coordinate; therefore, it is only required that its
evolution should be periodic. In other words, the aim of the second controller is to
bring the actuated coordinate as close as possible to a fixed desired state (q d
a , ˙q d
a ) at
the end of each half period, ensuring a certain periodicity of its evolution, leading
therefore to limit cycles generation.The resulting second model-free controller should

5.4
Application: the inertia wheel inverted pendulum system
The testbed of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum is presented in Section 5.2. The
basis of its mechanical structure is illustrated in Figure 5.5. The actuator produces
an angular acceleration of the rotating inertia wheel which generates, thanks to the
dynamic coupling between coordinates, a torque acting on the pendulum’s passive
joint; therefore, this passive joint can be controlled through the acceleration of the
inertia wheel. The goal of the proposed control solution (as introduced in Section 5.3)
is to generate stable limit cycles on both coordinates (actuated and unactuated) using
only one control input (namely the torque applied to the inertia wheel). The idea is
to control the angular position qna of the pendulum with respect to the vertical by
the first controller (tracking controller in Figure 5.3), while the angular velocity of
the inertia wheel (system’s internal dynamics) is controlled by the second controller
(stabilizing controller in Figure 5.3).

Dynamic modeling of the system
The mechanical structure of the inertia wheel inverted pendulum is sketched in Fig-

inverted pendulum system are summarized in Table 5.1.

Numerical simulations
Reference trajectories are generated for the unactuated coordinate qna as presented
in Section 5.3.2.2. The trajectories amplitude is 2A = 6◦and period is τ = 2 s.
Numerical simulations have been performed using MATLAB®/Simulink® software
of MathWorks. It is worth noting that the dynamic model (5.20) and (5.21) is used
to simulate the dynamic behavior of the system, it is not used in the controller
design.
The following design parameters were used in the implemented control scheme:
α1 = −100, α2 = 50, the feedback gains of the first controller (tracking controller)
are as follows: Kp1 = 200, Ki1 = 0 and Kd1 = 100. The feedback gains of the sec-
ond controller (stabilizing controller) are given by: Kp2 = Ki2 = 0 and Kd2 = 1. The
sampling frequency is set to 150 Hz which is a reasonable value for real-time imple-
mentation. The desired state for the inertia wheel velocity (controlled by the second
controller) is set to ˙q d
a = 0.
The obtained simulation results are depicted in Figure 5.6. It is worth to note
that a disturbing torque of intensity 0.5 N m is applied to the pendulum beam at
time t = 15 s. The convergence to a stable limit cycle can clearly be observed on
the phase portrait of the pendulum angle qna. The controller reacts immediately to
the disturbance as we can see a spike in the control signal (cf. Figure 5.6(e)). This
disturbance induces a deviation from the reference trajectories of the pendulum angle
position and velocity which is immediately compensated. Despite the big deviation of

Real-time experiments
Real-time experiments are achieved thanks to the experimental testbed described in
Section 5.2. It is worth to note that the control design parameters used for these
experiments are different from those used in numerical simulation. The first con-
troller parameters are chosen as α1 = −150, Kp1 = 70, Ki1 = 0 and Kd1 = 12. For the
Second controller the following parameters are used α2 = 70, Kp2 = 0, Ki2 = 0 and
Kd2 = 1. Noise filtering was performed through the use of an alpha-beta filter [25]

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
to correctly estimate the pendulum acceleration used in (5.15). The following two
experimental scenarios have been considered:
●
control in nominal case,
●
external disturbance rejection.
5.6.1
Scenario 1: Control in nominal case
In this first scenario, no external disturbances have been considered. The obtained
results for this scenario are depicted in Figure 5.7. The experiment was started by an
initial angular position corresponding to a pendulum body at the mechanical stop,
introducing an initial position error of 0.125 rad (i.e., 7.16◦). Despite this initial
error, the controller was able to steer rapidly the system toward the periodic reference
trajectory as it can be observed on Figure 5.7(a). The convergence to a stable limit
cycle is clearly visible in Figure 5.7(c). The control inputs are shown in Figure 5.7(e)
for the first controller and in Figure 5.7(f) for the second one. The motor power
admissibility is illustrated through the plot of Figure 5.7(g) showing the evolution of
the motor speed (absolute value) versus its torque (absolute value).
5.6.2
Scenario 2: External disturbance rejection
In this experiment, external disturbances are introduced by pushing the pendulum
body in a punctual manner as illustrated in Figure 5.8. Two external disturbances have
been introduced at approximately t1 = 12 s and t2 = 23 s. The obtained experimental
results are plotted in Figure 5.9. Noise in measurement is observable on all plots,
particularly amplified on the pendulum velocity ˙qna in Figure 5.9(b). Despite this
fact, the first controller was able to track the reference trajectory on the pendulum
(cf. Figure 5.9(a)). The effect of the introduced external disturbances can clearly
be observed on the pendulum trajectories in Figure 5.9(a) and the control input in
Figure 5.9(e). The tracking controller brings back rapidly the pendulum position and
velocity to their respective reference trajectories. The convergence to a stable limit
cycle is clearly visible on the phase portrait of the pendulum shown on Figure 5.9(c).

The evolution of the inertia wheel velocity is depicted in Figure 5.9(d). Indeed, the
introduced disturbances induce a shift in the inertia wheel velocity trajectory cycle.
However, thanks to the second controller reaction, which is observable in Figure
5.9(f), the inertia wheel velocity converges back to the limit cycle in few periods.
The absolute value of motor velocity versus the generated torque are displayed in
Figure 5.9(g) to check the admissible-region of the actuator. Notice that the obtained
trajectory remains, throughout the experiments, within the admissible region of the
actuator’s power.

Conclusion
This chapter deals with the control problem of the inertia wheel inverted pendu-
lum. This benchmark belongs to the class of underactuated mechanical systems. The
proposed control solution, based on model-free control technique, includes two con-
trollers to deal with stable limit cycle generation. The first controller (called tracking
controller) is used to control the angular position of the pendulum (unactuated coordi-
nate), whiletheangularvelocityoftheinertiawheel(actuatedcoordinate)iscontrolled
by the second controller (called stabilizing controller). Indeed, to stabilize the result-
ing internal dynamics of the system, a family of p-parameterized periodic trajectories
is generated and tracked by the first controller, while their parameter p is on-line
updated by the second controller in the aim of improving the behavior the internal
dynamics (i.e., convergence to a stable limit cycle). To validate the proposed control
scheme, numerical simulations as well as real-time experiments are introduced. They
show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme as well as its ability to reject
external disturbances. Future work may include the extension of the proposed control
scheme to endow it with an automatic adaptive tuning of the parameters of the con-
trollers, as well as its generalization to the case of underactuated systems with more
than one degree of underactuation.

Output feedback second-order sliding-mode
tracking control for perturbed inertia
wheel pendulum
Luis T. Aguilar1 and Rafael Iriarte2
We address the robust output feedback tracking control problem for an inertia wheel
pendulum in the presence of uniformly bounded matched disturbances. The periodic
motion of the pendulum will be at the upright position which corresponds to the unsta-
ble equilibrium point of the unforced system. A two-relay-controller-based reference
model was developed for generating the desired trajectories to be tracked by the unac-
tuated link of the inertia wheel pendulum and then design an output feedback robust
tracking controller. The desired amplitude and frequency were tuned by choosing
the two-relay control gains properly. A second-order sliding-mode tracking controller
interconnected with a second-order sliding-mode observer was capable to track the
prescribed reference trajectory rejecting matched external disturbances. Performance
issues of the constructed controller-observer were illustrated in a numerical study.
6.1
Introduction
For nonlinear mechanical systems, tracking control problem is known to be more
difficult than stabilization mainly for underactuated systems whose initial conditions
are close to an unstable equilibrium point. The tracking problem for nonminimum-
phase systems is a challenging topic in control since that further research applications
in the motion control of underactuated systems have gone in many directions. Orbital
stabilization problems where underactuated systems are evolved are the coordinated
motion of biped robots [8,11,20], gymnastic robots, electrical converters [1,18], and
others (see, e.g., [10,22] and references therein).
Astrategyaddressingtheself-oscillationandmotionplanningforaclassofunder-
actuated systems is presented in [2] based on the two-relay controller methodology. In
previous works [3–5], the oscillations at the output are generated for an inertia wheel
pendulum using such methodology without a tracking controller, reason that we called

self-oscillation. The drawback of the method is that the closed-loop system turns out
to be high sensitive to disturbances and the formulas of the two-relay controller are
function of parameters of the plant. In other words, the deviation of the frequency
and amplitude of the periodic trajectory at the output of the closed-loop structure pro-
posed in [3–5] with respect to the desired ones, is related with the uncertainties of the
parameters of the plant because formulas to compute the two values of the two-relay
controller depends on the exact knowledge of the physical parameters (e.g., inertias,
length of the links, and masses), while neglected dynamics, as friction, were not
considered as part of the formulas. Iriarte et al. [12] develop the two-relay controller
robustified with a state-feedback tracking controller, complemented with experimen-
tal verification, dealing with such inaccuracies. However, the output feedback case
has remained unaddressed in the above papers.
The aim of this chapter is to solve the output feedback-tracking control problem
for the inertia wheel pendulum under the presence of undesired disturbances. The
periodic motion of the pendulum will be at the upright position which corresponds
to the unstable equilibrium point of the unforced system. A two-relay-controller-
based reference model was used for generating the desired trajectories to be tracked
by the unactuated link of the inertia wheel pendulum and then, design an output
feedback robust tracking controller. The second-order sliding-mode observer was
taken from [16]. The desired amplitude and frequency were set by choosing the two-
relay control gains according to the formulas obtained from the describing function
method [13]. This chapter also refines the results of [12] where the asymptotical
stability proof of the closed-loop system is revisited.
The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 6.2, we give the dynamic model
of the plant and define the problem statement. Moreover, the trajectory generation,
via two-relay controller, to be tracked by the output of the plant is revised. In Sec-
tion 6.3, the variable structure observer is designed to estimate the velocity of the
motor and the pendulum. In Section 6.4, a second-order sliding-mode control is syn-
thesized to guarantee robust tracking of the reference trajectory. Numerical results
illustrate the performance of the proposed output feedback controller in Section 6.5.
Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 6.6.

The control objective is to find τ such that
lim
t→∞∥q1r(t) −q1(t)∥= 0
(6.4)
where q1r(t) is the desired trajectory of the pendulum. The desired trajectory is
designed such that qr(t), ˙qr(t), and ¨qr(t) ∈R2 are uniformly bounded in t.
6.2.1
Generating desired trajectories centered at the upright
equilibrium point
Let us recall from [12], the procedure to generate the set of trajectories for the inertia
wheel pendulum to follow. First, let us consider the dynamics of the wheel pendulum
in terms of the reference positions and velocities (qr, ˙qr) without viscous friction

with desired frequency  and amplitude Ap. Throughout, we confine our research
interest in desired oscillations around the upright position of the pendulum which
correspond to a challenging problem.
The inertia wheel pendulum has underactuation degree one satisfying certain
structural property provided in [10] (see details in Appendix A). As a result, it is
possible to make exact linearization thus achieving local stability of zero dynamics,
that is,
p1 = q1r + J −1
1 J2q2r −π
(6.6)
η = J1˙q1r + J2˙q2r + Kp1
(6.7)
where K > 0 is a constant. The last term in (6.6) ensures that the desired trajectories
will be generated around the equilibrium point q⋆
1r = π rad (see Figure 6.1). From
the latter set of equations, it is easy to verify that
J1˙p1 = η −Kp1

The following two-relay controller is proposed for the purpose of exciting a

ur = −c1 sign(yr) −c2 sign(˙yr)
(6.18)
where c1 and c2 are scalars parameters designed such that the scalar-valued function
output yr(t) has a periodic motion with the desired frequency  and amplitude Ap.

are [2]

defined as
Q1 = {ω ∈R : Re{W(jω)} > 0, Im{W(jω)} ≥0}
(6.21)

(6.23)
Q4 = {ω ∈R : Re{W(jω)} > 0, Im{W(jω)} < 0}.
(6.24)
The difference between (6.18) and the second-order sliding-mode controller given,
for example, in [15] is that c1 is not constrained to be positive and greater than c2.
The orbital stability analysis of (6.5), (6.18) is detailed in [2, Ch. 3] and [12], and it
is therefore omitted.

of the pendulum and the wheel, respectively; μp ≥0 and μw ≥0 are nonnegative
constants; bp = 1, bw = J1/J2 were chosen according to [16], and l1p, l2p, l1w, and l2w
are positive constants.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
6.4
Control synthesis
The control objective is to stabilize the pendulum around the desired trajectory and to
keep the wheel velocity bounded. This last can be achieved by introducing a feedback
from the rotor velocity. In this section, we will design an output feedback controller
which ensures (6.4) while providing boundedness of v2(t) and attenuating external
disturbances where the reference signal qr(t) ∈R2 is computed on line from (6.5),
(6.14), and (6.18). The control law is based on the assumption that q(t) ∈R2 is the
only measured variable.
Let the pendulum tracking error and the wheel velocity error be defined,
respectively, as
e1(t) ≜q1r(t) −q1(t),
(6.27)
˙e1(t) ≜˙q1r(t) −ˆv1(t),
(6.28)
˙e2(t) ≜˙q2r(t) −ˆv2(t).
(6.29)
Due to (6.1), (6.5)–(6.18), the errors dynamics are governed by

To verify that (ee

γ sign(˙e2) = α1 sign(e1) + α2 sign(0) + β1e1,
(6.36)
since ˙ee
1 = 0. Substituting the above equation into the last term of (6.35) together with
¨e2 = 0, we find that ee

Proof. We break the proof in two steps.
1. Finite-time convergence of (e1, ˙e1) to the origin. First, let us assume that v1(t) ≡
ˆv1(t) and v2(t) ≡ˆv2(t). Now, we will demonstrate that (e1, ˙e1) reach the origin
asymptotically. To this end, we consider the Lyapunov function
V1 = 1

which is radially unbounded almost everywhere. The positivity of the Lyapunov func-
tion V1 is verified if and only if  = T is positive definite and if α1 is also positive.
In particular, matrix  will be positive definite if β1 + εβ2 > 0 and if
β1 + εβ2 −ε2 > 0
(6.38)
are satisfied. By solving the latter quadratic inequality with respect to ε, we have

(6.39)
It is straightforward to show that the time derivative of V1 along the solution of the
closed-loop system (6.34) and (6.35) satisfies
˙V1 ≤−εβ1e2
1 −(β2 −ε)˙e2
1 −(α2 −γ −2J2	−1M)|˙e1|

The function ˙V1 will be negative-definite provided that (6.33) and β2 −ε > 0
are satisfied. Then, by applying [19, Th. 4.4] with parameters given in (6.33), it is
concluded that (6.4) is reached in finite-time ts.

144
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
Now, we will proof that ˙e2 will tends to the origin from ts to infinity. To this end,
note that the remaining dynamics of the velocity error of the wheel (6.35) is
¨e2 = −J1J −1
2 γ sign(˙e2).
(6.43)
Using the Lyapunov function V2(˙e2) = J −1
1 J2|˙e2| we have that
˙V2(˙e2) = −γ ,
(6.44)
therefore ˙V2(˙e2) will be negative definite for all t ≥ts.
2. Boundedness of wheel velocity. Finally, we need to prove that ˙e2 does not escape to
infinity in finite time, that is, limt→ts ∥˙e2(t)∥< ∞. To this end, let us rewrite (6.35)
as
¨e2 = −J1J −1
2 γ sign(˙e2) + g(e1, ˙e1, w)
(6.45)
where
g(e1, ˙e1, w) = h

(6.46)
Since (6.41)–(6.42) and the fact that e1 and ˙e1 decreases asymptotically to the origin
(i.e., |e1(t)| ≤|e1(0)| and |˙e1(t)| ≤|˙e1(0)|), the following upper bound for g(e1, ˙e1, w)
is obtained

Consider now the following Lyapunov function
V(˙e2) = J −1
1 J2|˙e2|.
(6.48)
The time derivative of V(˙e2) along the solution of the closed-loop system (6.45)–
(6.46) is
˙V(˙e2) = −J −1
1 J2 sign(˙e2)¨e2

1 J2∥g(e1, ˙e1, w)∥

1 J2ε0
(6.49)
where inequality (6.47) has been used. Due to inequality (6.33), the time derivative of
the Lyapunov function ˙V(˙e2) is not negative definite. However, integrating ˙V(˙e2(t))
from 0 to ts, we get
V(ts) ≤(J −1
1 J2ε0 −γ )ts + V(0)
(6.50)

Output feedback second-order sliding-mode tracking control
145
which implies
|˙e2(ts)| ≤(ε0 −J1J −1

(6.51)
Therefore, we conclude that ˙e2 is finite for ts < ∞.

Numerical results
In this section, we present simulation results using the laboratory inertial wheel pendu-
lum manufactured by Quanser Inc., depicted in Figure 6.1 where J1 = 4.572 × 10−3
kg m2, J2 = 2.495 × 10−5 kg m2, and h = 0.3544 kg m2 s−2 (see [6]). The viscous
friction coefficient fs = 8.80 × 10−5 N m s was identified by applying the procedure
from [14]. Simulations were carried out to achieve the orbital stabilization of the
unactuated link (pendulum) q1 around the equilibrium point q⋆= (π, 0).
Setting  = π/2 rad/s and Ap = 0.07 as desired frequency and amplitude, res-
pectively, we have c1 = 2 and c2 = −2 which have been computed from (6.19) and
(6.20). Invoking [2, Th. 2.1], the system (6.15) was orbitally asymptotically stable
under K = 1, a0 = 1, a1 = 2, and a2 = 1.

Perturbed closed-loop system results: (a) desired trajectory to follow,
(b) tracking pendulum position error, (c) wheel velocity,

The initial conditions for the inertia wheel pendulum, selected for the simulations,
were close to q1(0) = 3 rad and q2(0) = 0 rad, whereas all the velocity initial condi-
tions were set to v1(0) = v2(0) = 0 rad/s. The gains of the controller (6.32) were set
to α1 = 5, α2 = 2, β1 = 2, β2 = 1, and γ = 0.1. The gains of the observer (6.25)–
(6.26) were set to μp = 0.1, μw = 0.1, bp = 1, bw = 183.24, l1p = 10, l2p = 100,
l1w = 100, and l2w = 10 × 103.
Figure 6.2 shows the desired trajectory to follow, the tracking pendulum position
error, the wheel velocity, and the input torque for the disturbance-free case.This figure
corroborates that second-order sliding-mode controller guarantee finite-time stabi-
lization of the pendulum around the desired trajectory. In order to test the controller
robustness, a harmonic external disturbance wi = 0.02 sin(t) (i = 1, 2) is then applied
to the closed-loop system. Good performance and desired robustness properties of
the controller are concluded from Figure 6.3.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have synthesized an output feedback second-order sliding-mode con-
troller to solve the tracking control problem of the inertia wheel pendulum. Similar

to [2], the periodic motion of the pendulum will be at the upright position around
the unstable equilibrium point of the unforced system where the two-relay controller
was also used to induce of oscillations at the scalar output of the inertia wheel pen-
dulum reference model and then injected as desired trajectory to the closed-loop
system. Such configuration allows to generate oscillations without depend on the
neglected dynamics. Therefore, the resulting control law ensures rejection against
bounded matched disturbances, while numerical study verifies the performance of
the synthesized controller. The methodology allows to extend the results to a class of
underactuated systems of relative degree one.
Appendix A
A.1
Normal form transformation of the inertia wheel pendulum
reference model
In this Appendix we present the normal form transformation for the inertia wheel
pendulum. To begin with, let us introduce the following Theorem extracted from [17,
Th. 4.2.1].
Theorem 6.2. Consider an underactuated system with kinetic symmetry with respect
to the unactuated variable q1 and fully actuated shape variables q2,
m11(q2)¨q1 + m12(q2)¨q2 + h1(q, ˙q) = 0
(A.1)
m21(q2)¨q1 + m22(q2)¨q2 + h2(q, ˙q) = τ.
(A.2)
Let τ = α(q2)u + β(q, ˙q) be the collocated partially linearizing change of control for
(A.2). Assume all the elements of
ω = m−1
11 (q2)m12(q2)dq2
(A.3)
are exact one-forms and let ω = dϖ(q2). Then, there exists a global change of
coordinates (i.e., diffeomorphism) obtained from the Lagrangian of the system
p1 = q1 + ϖ(q2)
(A.4)
σ = m11(q2)˙q1 + m12(q2)˙q2 = ∂L

Let us consider the decomposition of (6.5) into its actuated and unactuated parts
(A.2) with m11 = J1, m12 = m22 = J2, h1(qr, ˙qr) = h sin(q1r), and h2(qr, ˙qr) = 0. So,
by Theorem 6.2, after applying the change of coordinates (A.5), that is

(A.13)
σ = J1˙q1r + J2˙q2r = ∂L

(A.16)
¨q2r = ur
(A.17)
where
ϖ(q2r) = J −1
1 J2q2r.
(A.18)
In the latter theorem, ur is an input which orbitally asymptotically stabilizes the
system, σ denote the generalized momentum conjugate to q1r, and L (qr, ˙qr) =
K(qr, ˙qr) −V(qr) is the Lagrangian where K(qr, ˙qr) and V(qr) denotes the kinetic
and potential energy, respectively.
Defining the output as
η = Kp1 + σ
(A.19)
along with (6.14) and (A.13)–(A.14), the system (A.15)–(A.17) in the coordinates
(η, ˙η, ¨η, p1)T becomes(6.15)–(6.17). ByapplyingTheorem6.1fromGrizzleetal.[10],
it follows that the zero dynamics (6.16) is exponentially stable.

Chapter 7
Switched integral sliding mode control for robust
generation of self-oscillation in pendulum systems
Juan Eduardo Velázquez-Velázquez1,
Rosalba Galván-Guerra1, Rafael Iriarte2
Abstract
Self-oscillations for pendulum systems generated by a two-relay controller are robus-
tified by using a switched integral sliding mode control. The robustification is
theoretically exact, assuring the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations remain
despite the presence of matched uncertainties/perturbations. To illustrate the efficacy
of the proposed robustifying strategy, an inertial wheel pendulum is considered along
the chapter.
7.1
Introduction
Self-oscillation (SO) is the generation and maintenance of a periodic motion by a
source of power that lacks a corresponding periodicity: the oscillation itself controls
the phase with which the power source acts on it (see [1] for more details about this
physical phenomenon). This phenomenon appears when the trajectories of the system
are attracted to a limit cycle [2].
The SO is characterized by its frequency and amplitude, which can be analyzed in
the frequency or in the state-space domains. In the frequency domain, the describing
function method [2–4] can be used to obtain an approximation of the oscillating char-
acteristics (frequency and amplitude) of the periodic motion. In state-space domain,
the Poincaré maps [2,3,5] give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the exis-
tence and stability of the periodic motion. Moreover, when a discontinuous controller
is used to generate a SO, the locus of a perturbed relay system (LPRS) [5] tool can be
used to find theoretically exactly the gains of the controller guaranteeing the desired
oscillating characteristics of the periodic motion.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
A common method for producing periodic motions is through tracking, that gives
traceability of different shapes, but if the desired frequency is high, it requires a lot
of energy. While by using the principle of SO, the shape is hardly controllable, but it
is possible to achieve high frequencies [6].
To generate SO, it is factible to introduce virtual holonomic constraints to the
nonlinear system [7], generating an exponentially orbitally stable periodic solution of
the system. To assure finite-time convergence to the limit cycle, a relay controller [5]
can be used. However, there are some systems (e.g., a double integrator) in which
the use of feedback having a single-valued nonlinearity (e.g., relay) may not produce
a desirable result. For systems with relative degree two, the two-relay controller
(TRC) [6] is capable to generate SO with a desired frequency and amplitude. But
the main disadvantage with the SO generation methodologies is that they are not
robust, and any uncertainty/perturbation may change the frequency and amplitude of
the oscillations.
To robustify SO, the sliding modes methodologies are a good option when the
uncertainties/perturbations are matched, i.e., they affect directly the channels of the
controller. One way to robustify SO is to identify and to compensate the uncertain-
ties/perturbations [8], to track an asymptotic harmonic generator based on a Van der
Pol equation [9] using a twisting controller or to track a nominal trajectory gener-
ated by the TRC by using a high-order sliding mode control or a quasicontinuous
one [10,11]. But during the reaching phase, those approaches are incapable to com-
pensate the uncertainties/perturbations. Furthermore, by the intrinsic characteristics
oftheTRC,theclosed-loopsystemhasaswitchedbehavior, andnoneofthementioned
approaches contemplate this issue.
The integral sliding modes (ISM) [12] allow theoretically exact compensation of
the matched uncertainties/perturbations without explicit computation of the nominal
trajectory. For switched linear systems, a switched ISM (SISM) approach has been
recently extended in [13]. This approach allows to compensate theoretically exactly
the matched uncertainties/perturbations just after the initial time despite the presence
of switchings.
In this chapter, a robustifying methodology for SO with a given frequency and
amplitude generated by a TRC is proposed. A SISM controller is used to compensate
the matched uncertainties/perturbations right after the initial time.
The chapter is organized as follows: Section 7.2 presents some preliminaries
concepts for stable SO generation with the TRC together with a motivational exam-
ple of an inertial wheel pendulum (IWP) that shows the necessity of a robustifying
procedure; this section ends with the problem formulation. Then, in Section 7.3, the
robustifying strategy is presented, and a computational algorithm resumes the pro-
posed strategy. In Section 7.4, robust SO are generated in the IWP by applying the
robustifying strategy. Finally, in Section 7.5, some comments conclude the chapter.

7.2
Preliminaries and problem formulation
7.2.1
Uncertain system
Consider the following uncertain nonlinear system
˙x(t) = f (x, t) + g(x, t)(u(t) + w(t))
(7.1)
where f : Rn × R →Rn, g : Rn × R →Rn are known continuous functions, x(t) ∈
Rn and u(t) ∈R are the states and control vector, respectively. Note that we are assum-
ing the full state vector is available. w(t) ∈R denotes the uncertainties/perturbations
present in the system, and it is assumed unknown but bounded, i.e., |w(t)| ≤wmax.
By using any linearization method, the above system is represented by an uncertain
linear time-invariant system (ULTIS)
˙x(t) = Ax(t) + B(u(t) + φ(t))
(7.2)
we assume that the system (7.2) is controllable and Bφ(t) = f (x, t) + g(x, t)(u(t) +
w(t)) −Ax(t) −Bu(t). The last assumption assures the uncertainties/perturbations φ
is matched. Moreover, if the system is stable, the uncertainties/perturbations remain
bounded, i.e., |φ(t)| ≤φmax.
Without loss of generality, the control u(t) is designed such that it generates SO
on an arbitrary scalar output y(t) = Cx(t), around a given reference yref ∈R with a
desired frequency  and amplitude A .
7.2.2
Generation of self-oscillations: two-relay controller
Let’s define a nominal linear time-invariant system (NLTIS) by assuming the absence
of uncertainties/perturbations, i.e., φ(t) = 0,
˙xNom(t) = AxNom(t) + B¯u(t)
(7.3)
where the control vector ¯u(t) = uNom(t) + uTRC(t) is composed by a stabilizer
controller uNom(t) = −K xNom(t) and a TRC [6] uTRC given by
uTRC(t) = −c1sign(ς(t)) −c2sign( ˙ς(t))
(7.4)
where ς(t) = yref −yNom(t), and c1 and c2 are design parameters chosen in such a way
that the scalar output y has a steady periodic motion with frequency  and amplitude

form
˙xNom(t) = ˜AxNom(t) + BuTRC(t)

To assure the orbital asymptotic stability of the SO periodic motion of the closed-loop
system (7.3), the TRC gains must fulfill the following theorem.

uTRC,4 =
c1 + c2 if ς(t) < 0 and ˙ς(t) < 0
(7.12)
Hence, (7.5) can be restated as an affine switched NLTIS (ASNLTIS)

4 if ς(t) < 0 and ˙ς(t) < 0

and Fi = BuTRC,i, i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}.
The nominal trajectory can be used to detect when the switching variables ς and ˙ς
change their values, i.e., it can be used to detect the switching moments tj, defined as
tj = min{t : t > tj−1, σ(t−) ̸= σ(t), j = 0, 1, . . .}
(7.15)
Observe that since the nominal trajectory is designed to assure a steady periodic
motion with a desired frequency and amplitude, we can assume that the switching
moments conform an ordered sequence
0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tj−1 < tj < · · ·

where q1(t), q2(t) ∈R are the absolute angle of the pendulum and the disk, respec-
tively, counted clockwise from the vertical downward position. τ(t) ∈R is the
controlled torque applied to the disk, while w(t) denotes external perturbations. J1, J2,

and the inertia–mass distribution, while fs is the viscous friction coefficient, and it is

The control objective is to achieve orbital stabilization of the unactuated link
q1 around the unstable equilibrium point q∗= [π
0]T with a desired frequency
 = 2π rad/s and amplitude A = 0.07 rad. For simulation purposes, it is assumed
that q1(0) = 3 rad, q2(0) = 0 rad, ˙q1(0) = ˙q2(0) = 0 rad/s, J1 = 4.572 × 10−3, J2 =

and a2 = 22. Here, we assume y(t) = q1(t).
Under the assumption that φ(t) = 0, to achieve the desired frequency and ampli-
tude, the LPRS method was applied to obtain the TRC gains c1 = 2 and c2 = −2.5.
In Figure 7.2, the behavior of the IWP is obtained with the TRC. Observe that q1 has
frequency of 2π rad/s and an amplitude of 0.07 rad. Recall that due to the switched

The behavior of the pendulum angle is shown in Figure 7.3. Note that the nominal

tude of the pendulum angle. Furthermore, the uncertainties/perturbations affect the
trajectory of the system, and hence, the switching moments are quite different from
the nominal ones (see second plot of Figure 7.3).
7.2.4
Problem statement
Considering a control input u(t) = ¯u(t) + uInt, the linearized uncertain system (7.2)
can be restated as an affine switched ULTIS (ASULTIS)
˙x(t) = ˜Ax(t) + Fσ(t) + B(uInt(t) + φ(t)), y(t) = Cx(t).
(7.23)
In the rest of the chapter, we will design a robustifying controller uInt such that the
ASULTIS (7.23) has SO with a desired frequency  and amplitude A despite
the presence of matched uncertainties/perturbations, i.e., the ASULTIS behaves as
the ASNLTIS (7.13) theoretically exactly right after the initial time.

Sliding variable design
To compensate the uncertainties/perturbations, we use a SISM strategy [13] that com-
pensates the effects of the matched uncertainties/perturbations theoretically exactly
right after the initial time. A block diagram with the overall control strategy is shown
in Figure 7.4.
Let’s define the following integral sliding variable

with the projection matrix G = B+. Observe that this variable is in the origin at every
switching moment, i.e., s(x(tj), tj) = 0. Now, taking the first derivative with respect
to time along the trajectories of (7.23),
˙s(x, t) = uInt(t) + φ(t)

Hence, the sliding modes dynamic of the system (7.23) takes the form
˙x(t) = ˜Ax(t) + Fσ(t)
(7.27)
that is equivalent to the nominal system (7.13), if the establishment of the sliding
mode since the initial time is assured.
7.3.2
Controller design
Let the SISM controller in the unitary form
uInt = −β s

(7.28)
where β is a design constant. The next theorem gives sufficient conditions to assure
the sliding variable (7.24) remains in the origin since the initial time.
Theorem 7.2. [13]
If
β > ∥B∥φmax
(7.29)
the sliding mode is established since the initial time, and the matched uncertain-
ties/perturbations are compensated right after the initial time.
The robust SO control strategy based on the SISM controller can be summarized
in the following algorithm (see Figure 7.5 for a flowchart of the algorithm).

Applied torque: SISM
The behavior of the IWP with the SISM controller is illustrated in Figure 7.6,
and the sliding mode variable is given in Figure 7.7. Observe that the perturbed IWP
is in the sliding mode since the initial time and behaves as the nominal one right after
the initial time; this assures the switching moments coincide, and as it is shown in
Figure 7.8, the desired frequency and amplitude for the pendulum angle is achieved
despite the presence of the matched uncertainties/perturbations. Finally, the applied
torque is given in Figure 7.9.

Conclusion
For pendulum systems with SO generated by the TRC, a robustifying strategy based
on an ISM approach is proposed. TheTRC generates SO with a desired frequency and
amplitude, and due to the intrinsic switching characteristic of the TRC, the closed-
loop system is considered a switched affine one. The considered approach robustifies
the SO against bounded matched uncertainties/perturbations. By using MATLAB®
simulations, for the IWP example, it is shown that the SISM compensates right
after the initial time the matched uncertainties/perturbations, assuring the switching
moments and the desired frequency and amplitude of the SO remain.

Introduction
Underactuated mechanical systems [13,14,27] are those systems with less control
inputs than generalized coordinates (called also degrees of freedom), i.e., they have
unactuated generalized coordinates. For such systems, the unactuated generalized
coordinates may indirectly be controlled by the actuated coordinates through the
dynamic coupling, inherent to these systems [8]. This coupling is often nonlinear,
resulting in generally nonintegrable dynamic constraints and therefore second-order
nonholonomic.
Many examples of such systems exist, and mainly in robotics. They include,
among others, inverted pendulums [16,25,26], underactuated robot manipulators [6],
gymnast robots and particularly the acrobot [41] and the pendubot [31], undersea
vehicles [15], PVTOL (PlanarVerticalTakeoff and Landing) aircrafts [35] and mobile
robots [18].
Underactuation in these mechanical systems is generally introduced intentionally
atthedesignleveltoreducethemanufacturingcost, theweightand/orfailurerate; con-
sequently, the obtained systems may be able to perform complex tasks with a reduced
number of actuators. The source of underactuation may also be unintentionally due
to failure of one or more actuators in a fully actuated system.
Underactuated systems may require new approaches/techniques to design effec-
tive control strategies; therefore, they constitute a good framework for nonlinear
control problems regarding both theoretical and practical aspects. For these reasons,
they are attracting more and more attention of researchers from nonlinear control
community as well as from many research fields in robotics.
In the literature, many research efforts have been made in control aspects
[30–32,39,41–43], giving rise to multiple control solutions; however, control problem
of such systems is still open.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
For instance in [9], a technique of pseudolinearization using spline functions is
proposed to control the acrobot underactuated system. In [42], a design technique
combining partial feedback linearization and Lyapunov methods based on satura-
tion functions, switching and energy shaping has been proposed. In [43], the author
discuss a survey on some existing results such as geometric nonlinear control and
passivity-based control for stabilization and tracking control of such systems. Three
control algorithms have been proposed in [30] for an underactuated two-link robot,
namely an optimal LQ controller, a partial feedback-linearizing regulator and a slid-
ing mode controller. In [31], the testbed is also a two-link underactuated robot but
the actuator is located at the base (in contrast to the one proposed in [30] where
the actuator is located at the joint between the two links), and the authors propose
a method based on partial feedback linearization [40], nilpotent approximation and
an iterative stabilization procedure. Roughly speaking, they propose an open-loop
controller able to steer the system closer to the desired equilibrium point in finite
time, and apply it iteratively, which provides a robust exponential convergence to the
equilibrium. In [32], the authors propose to study the nonlinear behavior of the same
robot proposed in [31] through a graphical tool based on Poincaré map. The study
in [39] concerns underactuated mechanical systems with several actuated degrees of
freedom and a single unactuated degree of freedom, where a discontinuous nonlinear
feedback controller is proposed, allowing the closed-loop equilibrium at the origin
to be globally attractive. In [45], a generalized predictive controller has been pro-
posed, based on the linearized dynamics of the system. In [10], a nonlinear predictive
controller is proposed for both stabilization and stable-limit cycle generation with an
application to the ECP 505 inverted pendulum. In [44], a technique based on switch-
ing and saturation control is proposed. In [11], a passivity-based approach has been
proposed to control the inertia wheel inverted pendulum. In [17], the technique of
virtual holonomic constraints has been proposed with an application to the pendubot
for generation of periodic motions, and to the Inertia Wheel Pendulum in [16]. In [3],
the proposed control techniques are based on partial feedback linearization, combined
with the optimization of the reference trajectories to stabilize the internal dynamics
of the system. In [4] and [5], a dual-model-free control technique is proposed. The
control architecture includes two model-free controllers, the first one is used to track
the reference trajectories on the actuated degrees of freedom of the system, whereas
the second one is used to stabilize the internal dynamics. In [25], a technique based on
Riccati and nonlinear control is proposed for inverted pendulums. Output feedback
control with an extended high gain observer was recently proposed in [28].
To deal with model uncertainties, a time-scale approach along with the Lyapunov
design has been proposed in [38]. The authors in [34] used a sliding mode technique
for the cart–pole system to stabilize the system in presence of disturbances. Model
uncertainties however have not been tackled in this work. In [1], disturbances and
model uncertainties have been fully considered in a technique that involves a back-
stepping procedure combined with sliding mode, applied to the inverted pendulum
system after the system was converted into a normal form. Integral sliding mode
control was also applied in [46] to deal with uncertainties in the two-wheeled mobile

inverted pendulum. The control law being designed is based on the linearized system
dynamics which resulted in a small region of attraction for the equilibrium. The prob-
lem becomes more challenging whenever nonparametric uncertainties and unknown
time-varying disturbances are considered in the design of effective and robust control
law for the underactuated system.
An important research issue which has attracted the attention of the control com-
munityisthefinite-timeconvergenceandfinite-timestabilization[2,7,19–21,24], that
ensures faster convergence rate, better disturbance rejection and robustness against
uncertainty. Although myriad approaches have been proposed in the literature that
tackle the problem of finite-time stabilization, they are not effective in dealing with
time-varying and state-depending uncertainties. Few attempts have been concentrated
in the design of adaptive schemes [22,23] to resolve the problem of state dependent
and time-varying uncertainties. However, the adaptive scheme has only been applied
to a class of p-normal forms [12].To the best of the authors’knowledge, few have dealt
with finite-time stabilization of underactuated systems subject to time-varying and
state-dependent uncertainties. This chapter focuses on the design of a novel nonlinear
controller for a class of underactuated system; we would like to introduce a new strat-
egy that addresses an adaptive robust finite-time stabilization law derived from adding
power integrator (API) [36] technique to a class of single input dynamics described
as a normal form system [33]. The idea is to generate coordinate transformations that
decouple the underactuated dynamics into an upper-triangular form allowing for only
one control input governing the whole system to be designed, whereby a continuous
finite-time stabilizing control law is derived from the API technique, and an adaptive
compensator is proposed to compensate for the matched and unmatched uncertainties
collected throughout the steps of the design. As a consequence, the resulting control
law is able to stabilize the underactuated mechanical system in a finite time.
The reminder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 8.2 discusses the
Lagrangian model of mechanical underactuated systems and the coordinate trans-
formation that transforms this model into a normal-form representation. Section 8.3
formulates the finite-time stabilization problem for the nth-order underactuated sys-
tem. Section 8.4 gives a background on finite-time stability and provides some useful
lemmas needed throughout the paper. The control design is developed in Section
8.5. Simulation results with an application to the cart–pole system are presented and
discussed in Section 8.6. Finally, Section 8.7 draws a conclusion for this chapter.

Dynamic modeling of underactuated mechanical systems:
Lagrangian formalism
The Lagrangian formalism is one among the powerful mathematical tools based on
the vibrational method to model a large class of mechanical systems. Underactuated
mechanical systems are branches of this class. They can be modeled using the Euler–
Lagrangeequations. LetQ beann-dimensionalconfigurationmanifold, andq ∈Q isa

system of n degrees of freedom (DOF) are given by [33]

∂˙q
−∂L(q, ˙q)
∂q
= B(q)u
(8.1)
where u ∈Rm and B(q) is the external forces matrix. L(q, ˙q) is the Lagrangian asso-
ciated to the mechanical system and expressed by the difference between kinetic and
potential energies:
L(q, ˙q) = K −V = 1
2 ˙q⊤M(q)˙q −V(q)
(8.2)
where K is the kinetic energy, V(q) denotes the potential energy and M(q) = M ⊤(q) ∈
Rn×n is a positive definite inertia matrix. Let mik ∈R+ denote the entries of the inertia
matrix M with i = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , n. Based on (8.1) and (8.2), the equations
of motion can be deduced as follows:

(8.4)
In a matrix form, (8.3) can be rewritten as
M(q)¨q + C(q, ˙q)˙q + G(q) = B(q)u
(8.5)
The term C(q, ˙q) includes two distinct terms, in particular, the first term qi˙qk involves
the centrifugal forces (i = k), and the second is the Coriolis forces for (i ̸= k), and
G(q) represents the gravity vector. It is interesting to point out that the mechanical
system described by (8.5) satisfies the skew symmetric property of the matrix ˙M(q) −
2C(q, ˙q).
It is important to distinguish two categories of mechanical systems governed by
the equation of motion (8.5).A mechanical system described by (8.5) is said to be fully
actuated if m = n, which is equivalent to say that the matrix B(q) ∈Rn×m is invertible.
In other words, it can be roughly inferred that the mechanical system is fully actuated,
if the number of actuators is equal to the dimension of its configuration manifold.
On the other hand, if m < n, the mechanical system is said to be underactuated,
which is equivalent to have fewer independent inputs than the number of degree of
freedom to be controlled. This implies that the matrix B(q) becomes noninvertible
and consequently the underactuated mechanical system as opposed to fully actuated
systems is not exact feedback linearizable. Because the number of inputs is less than
the number of degree of freedom, the controllability of the mechanical underactuated
system is not always satisfied. In this chapter, however, we will assume that the

Finite-time stabilization of underactuated mechanical systems

considered mechanical systems are controllable. Furthermore, we suppose that the
equation of motion (8.5) can be rearranged so that the matrix B(q) can be written as:
B(q) =
 0(n−m)×m
Im

(8.6)
where the first n −m equations of (8.5) represent the unactuated dynamics while the
last m equations are the actuated dynamics. The generalized coordinates q can further
be partitioned as follows:
q =
 qu
qa

(8.7)
where qu ∈R(n−m) is the vector of unactuated configuration variables and qa ∈Rm is
the vector of actuated configuration variables. Then, it is straightforward to rewrite
the equation of motion (8.5) as follows:
 m11(q) m12(q)
m21(q) m22(q)
  ¨qu
¨qa

+
 c11(q) c12(q)

  ˙qu
˙qa

+
 g1(q)
g2(q)

=
 0
u2

(8.8)
The partitioned equation of motion (8.8) can also be represented in component form
as follows:
m11(q)¨qu + m12(q)¨qa + h1(q, ˙q) = 0
(8.9)
m21(q)¨qu + m22(q)¨qa + h2(q, ˙q) = u2
(8.10)
where h1(q, ˙q) = c11(q)˙qu + c12(q)˙qa + g1(q) and h2(q, ˙q) = c21(q)˙qu + c22(q)˙qa +
g2(q). It is worth to notice that there is no control input in (8.9); therefore, it is
not possible to feedback linearize the system (8.9) and (8.10). It is however possible
to partially feedback linearize the system using a change of control. The procedure of
linearization of the actuated dynamics is called collocated partial linearization which
is credited to Spong [43] and consists in finding a global invertible change of control
of the form u2 = α(q)v + β(q, ˙q) that partially linearizes the dynamics (8.8) such
as, after partial linearization, the new control v appears in the nonlinear-subsystem
dynamics as well as in the linearized subsystem dynamics as follows:
¨qu = f 1(q, ˙q) + g1(q, ˙q)v
(8.11)
¨qa = v
(8.12)
It can be observed that the unactuated part (8.11) is still complex, while the actuated
part (8.12) is linearized into a double-integrator dynamics. The new control input v
is present in both subsystems, which largely increases the difficulty in the control
design. The author in [33] introduced a global change of coordinates that decouples
these two subsystems and transforms the dynamics of the system into a cascaded form
called the normal form, where the control input of the original actuated subsystem
does not appear in the unactuated subsystem. This significantly simplifies the control
design for the underactuated mechanical system. However, with this approach, there
is an inherent requirement that the model parameters of the mechanical system must
be perfectly known to be able to design controller for the transformed normal form.

170
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
Due to lack of knowledge on the system parameters and the inability to measure
the whole system state, the controller has to cope with these uncertainties. This
situation justifies the need for the development of a global transformation that decou-
ples the underactuated mechanical system without passing by the partial feedback
linearization of the system.
Consider the dynamic (8.9), resolve for ¨qu, it gives
¨qu = −m11(q)−1(m12(q)¨qa + h1(q, ˙q))
(8.13)
Substituting (8.13) into (8.10), after some manipulation, we obtain
¨qa = f 3(q, ˙q) + b3(q)u2
(8.14)
Again substituting the resulting dynamics (8.14) into the dynamics of (8.10), then
solving for ¨qu leads to the following dynamics:
¨qu = f 4(q, ˙q) + b4(q)u2
(8.15)
wheref 3(q, ˙q) = (m22 −m21m−1
11 m12)−1[m21m−1
11 h1(q, ˙q) −h2(q, ˙q)] =, b3(q) = (m22 −
m21m−1
11 m12)−1, f 4(q, ˙q) = −m−1
11 m12 f4(q, ˙q −m−1
11 h1(q, ˙q))andb4(q) = −m−1
11 m12b3(q).
Regrouping the dynamic (8.14) and (8.15), one can obtain a state-space representation
of the system as follows:
˙x1 = x2
˙x2 = f 3(q, ˙q) + b3(q)u2
˙x3 = x4
(8.16)
˙x4 = f 4(q, ˙q) + b4(q)u2
where the state space vector x has been defined as [x1, x2, x3, x4]⊤= [qu, ˙qu, qa, ˙qa]⊤.
Note the structural difference between (8.12), (8.11) and (8.16) is that the actuated
dynamics in (8.12) is a double integrator, while in (8.16), the actuated dynamics has
some nonlinearities.
To decouple the nonlinear system represented by (8.16), we may use the global
transformation proposed in [33] as follows:
z1 = x1 −
 x3

z2 = x2 −b3(x)

(8.18)

Clearly, the dynamics of the underactuated system in Z-space, is in a special cascade
form with only one control input appearing in the last subsystem.To ease the represen-
tation, let us define d1(z) = b3(z)

z4, d3(z) = 0, then the system (8.18) can be rewritten as
˙z1 = z2 + d1(z)
˙z2 = z3 + d2(z)
˙z3 = z4 + d3(z)
(8.19)
˙z4 = f4(z) + b4(z)u2
where d1(z), d2(z) and d3(z) are regarded as unmatched uncertainties to be compen-
sated by the control u2. In a similar manner, an nth-order underactuated system can
be represented in the state space form as
˙x1 = x2
˙x2 = f 3(q, ˙q) + b3(q)u
˙x3 = x4
˙x4 = f 4(q, ˙q) + b4(q)u

(8.20)
˙xn−1 = xn
˙xn = f n(q, ˙q) + bn(q)u
To decouple the nth order system (8.20), the global transformation as proposed in [33]
can be extended to nth order recursively as follows:
z1 = x1 −
 x3

(8.24)

where di(z) ∈R, i = 1, 2, . . . , n are regarded as matched and unmatched uncertain-
ties. It can be noticed that by construction, the variation bounds of the uncertainties
di(z), i = 1, . . . , n are not assumed to be known and also cannot be assumed linearly
parameterizable into a multiplication of a known regressor and a vector of unknown
constant parameters. Also for the simplicity of the control design, let us consider the
following two assumptions:
Assumption 8.1. The terms di(z), i = 1, . . . , n are all unknown functions, whose
bounds are also unknown.
Assumption 8.2. The uncertain control coefficient bn(z) is bounded as bmin ≤bn(z) ≤
bmax and bn(z) is sign-definite such that sign(bn(z)) = +1. Further, it is convenient to
assume that bn(z) ̸= 0.

Control problem formulation
In this chapter, we consider a class of underactuated systems of the form (8.20),
which can be transformed without partial feedback linearization and through the
global change of coordinates (8.21) into the cascaded form (8.24). Where z =
[z1, z2, . . . , zn]⊤∈, where  is a compact set of Rn, u ∈R is the control input
and di(z) ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n −1 are unmatched uncertainties, while dn is the matched
uncertainty. Under Assumptions 8.1 and 8.2, the idea is to design the controller

Preliminaries
In this section, a review of some basic concepts and lemma related to the concept
of finite-time stability and the corresponding Lyapunov theorem are presented; they
will be useful for most of the stability analysis of this chapter.
8.4.1
Notions of finite stability
Theorem 8.1. [7]: Consider the non-Lipschitz continuous autonomous system ˙x =
f (x), f (0) ∈R.Assume, there are C1 function V(x) defined on a neighborhood D ⊂R
of the origin, and real numbers c > 0 and 0 < α < 1 such that
1.
V(x) is positive definite on D
2.
˙V(x) + cV α ≤0,
∀x ∈D
Then, the origin x is locally finite-time stable. If D = R, and V(x) is radially
unbounded, then the origin x = 0 is globally finite-time stable. Moreover, it can be
verified that the settling time being dependent on the initial state x(0) = x0 satisfies
Tx(x0) ≤V(x0)1−α
c(1−α) for all x0 in some open neighborhood of the origin.
Lemma 8.1. [36] For any xi ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n and 0 < p ≤1, the following inequal-
ity holds (|x1| + · · · + |xn|)p ≤|x1|p + · · · + |xn|p ≤n1−p(|x1| + · · · + |xn|)p. When
0 < p = p1
p2 ≤1, where p1 and p2 are positive odd integers, then the following holds
|xp −yp| ≤21−p|x −y|p, for any x, y ∈R.
Lemma 8.2.
[36]
For any x ∈R, y ∈R, c > 0, d > 0 and γ (x, y) > 0,
a
real-valued function, the following holds: |x|c|y|d ≤(cγ (x, y)/(c + d))|x|c+d +
(dγ (x, y)−c/d/(c + d))|y|c+d.
8.5
Proposed control design
The purpose of this section is to devise a control law that stabilizes the system
(8.24) in finite time. Given the fact that the Z-system (8.24) contains unmatched
uncertainty, traditional adaptive techniques like the backstepping technique [29] and
the multiple-surface sliding [37] cannot be used, because the variation bounds of
di, i = 1, . . . , n are not assumed to be known. To solve the problem of finite-time sta-
bilization with unmatched uncertainties, we propose a novel robust finite-time control
scheme whereby a continuous recursive finite-time stabilizing control law is derived
from the API technique [36] and an adaptive compensator.

Finite-time stabilization of underactuated mechanical systems
175
To develop the finite-time controller for (8.24), we first introduce the following
tracking error e1 and the virtual errors em, m = 2, . . . , n as follows:
e1 = z1 −z∗
1d
(8.26)
and
em = z1/qm
m
−z∗1/qm
md
,
m = 2, . . . , n
(8.27)
where qm = (4ℓn + 3 −2m)/(4ℓn + 1) > 0, (ℓ∈Z+); z∗
m, m = 2, . . . , n is the virtual
control given by z∗
md = −βm−1eqm
m−1 with βm−1 being positive constant to be determined
later. One main feature for the use of the parameter ℓin the fraction power qm is that
it allows adjusting the control precision and finite-time convergence of the state
variables.
The design procedure consists in n steps, throughout the n −1 steps, the virtual
controllers z∗
(m−1)d will be designed. Upon the completion of step n, the fast control
term as well the adaptive compensator are designed.
Step 1: Consider the following Lyapunov candidate function:
V1(z) =
1
1 + S e1+S
1
(8.28)
where S = (4ℓn −1)/(4ℓn + 1). The time derivative of (8.28) gives
˙V1(z) = eS
1 ˙e1
= eS
1z∗
2 + eS
1(z2 −z∗
2d) + eS
1d1(z)
(8.29)
By introducing the virtual control z∗
2d = −β1eS
1, where β1 is a design parameter, ˙V1(z)
rewrites:
˙V1(z) = −β1e2S
1 + eS
1(z2 −z∗
2d) + eS
1d1(z)
(8.30)
Using Lemmas 8.1 and 8.2, the second term of (8.30) can be upper-bounded as
follows:
eS
1(z2 −z∗
2d) ≤21−S|e2|S|e1|S ≤1
2|e1|2S + C2|e2|2S
(8.31)
where C2 is a positive constant. In light of (8.31), the time derivative of V1(z) can be
written as follows:
˙V1(z) ≤−β1e2S
1 + 1
2|e1|2S + C2|e2|2S + eS
1d1(z)
(8.32)
Step 2:According to [24], a C1 and positive definite Lyapunov candidate function
is constructed as
V2((z)) = V1(z) + W2(z1, z2)
(8.33)
with
W2(z1, z2) =

Combining (8.32), (8.39) and (8.41) yields the following:

3d + e2(z3 −z∗
3d) + τ1 (8.42)

Finite-time stabilization of underactuated mechanical systems
177
At this stage, it is worth to note that q3 = q2 −
2
4ℓn+1, which implies that q3 =
1 + 2q2 = 1 + 2S. Therefore, by selecting β1 > n −1 −κ, where κ > 0 is a design
parameter, and the virtual control z∗
3d = −β2zq3
2d with β2 ≥n −2 + κ + C2 + ¯C2,
we obtain
˙V2 ≤−(n −2 + κ)|e1|2S −(n −2 + κ)|e2|2S + e2(z3 −z∗
3d) + τ1
(8.43)
Step k (k:= 3 . . . n −1): We proceed to the derivation of the virtual control by
using an inductive argument. Suppose at step k −1, that there exists a C1 Lyapunov
candidate function Vk−1(z1, . . . , zk−1), positive definite and verifies

Now let us claim that (8.44) and (8.45) hold as step k. To prove this claim, consider
the following Lyapunov candidate function:
Vk(z1, . . . , zk) = Vk−1(.) + Wk(z1, . . . , zk)

with

Theorem 8.2
Consider the nth order underactuated system in the X -space represented by (8.20),
through the coordinate transformation (8.21) and under Assumptions 8.1 and 8.2,
the finite-time convergence objective specified in (8.25) is achieved by the control
input u consisting of (8.64) and the compensator (8.65) with the virtual control

Proof. Consider the Lyapunov function V = Vn(.). Since bn

then V ≤Vn(.) + bn

that the solutions of the closed-loop system consisting of (8.24) and the control input

limit in (8.25) is satisfied. This completes the proof.

Numerical simulations: the case of the cart–pole system
The cart–pole inverted pendulum depicted schematically in Figure 8.1 consists of a
pole mounted on a cart by means of a pivot in such a way that the pole can freely swing
in the x–y plane. The equations of motion can be obtained by neglecting friction in
the pivot and by applying the Euler–Lagrange formulation. The system model can be
represented as follows [34]:
(M + m sin2 θ)¨x −m sin θ(l ˙θ 2 −g cos θ) = u
(8.71)
(M + m sin2 θ)l ¨θ + ml ˙θ 2 sin θ cos θ −(M + m)g sin θ = −cos θ(u)
where M is the mass of the cart, m is the mass of the pendulum, l is half the length of
the pendulum, i.e., the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the pendulum,
g is the acceleration due to gravity. The cart–pole system has two equilibrium points,
one of which is known as the stable vertically downward position where θ = π,
and the other one being the unstable vertically upward position where θ = 0. F(t)

To demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust finite control law, we have
performed numerical simulations on MATLAB®/Simulink® framework, considering
the following system parameters m = 1 kg, M = 2 kg and l = 0.5 m. The initial
conditions are chosen as x = [1, 0, π
3 , 0]⊤, the desired state is xd = [0, 0, 0, 0]⊤. The
control gains are chosen to be κ = 10, β1 = 13, β2 = 12, β3 = 11 and β4 = 20. Dif-
ferent simulation scenarios have been considered. The first simulation scenario is
the control of uncertain cart–pole system without external disturbances. The second
one considers the case of an uncertain cart–pole system with the presence of external
disturbances.

Scenario 1: Uncertain cart–pole system without external disturbances
In this scenario, we assume that the system dynamics is completely unknown
except for the sign condition in Assumption 8.2. The obtained simulation results

In this simulation scenario, on top of the uncertainties that the system dynamics
contains, a periodic perturbation d(t) = sin (2t) is added as an external exci-
tation to the cart–pole system during the time interval t ∈[20, 35] s in order
to test the robustness of the proposed control approach. The obtained simula-
tion results are depicted in Figures 8.5–8.7. From Figure 8.5, it can be noticed
that despite the existing uncertainties and the considered external disturbance,

after the application of the disturbances is shown in Figure 8.6, clearly the
amplitude of the control input even with the external perturbation remains with
reasonable size. The convergence of the state variables in Z-space is shown in
Figure 8.7. From these figures, it can be seen that our control design is robust
to tolerate significant variation of the system parameters as well as the external
disturbances.

Conclusion
In this paper, the problem of global finite-time stabilization was addressed for the
control of a class of uncertain underactuated mechanical systems. By integrating a
fractional power feedback control method with a compensator, the uncertainties in
the system can be effectively handled and finite-time stabilization is achieved. Future
work is to extend the current design technique to a class of chained form systems
perturbed by external disturbances as well as experiments on the inertia wheel inverted
pendulum.

Advances in robust control of mobile wheeled

Abstract
There has been increasing interest in a type of underactuated mechanical systems,
mobile-wheeled inverted-pendulum (MWIP) models, which are widely used in
autonomous robotics and intelligent vehicles. To cope with the model uncertain-
ties and external disturbances, several robust controllers are designed for the MWIP
models. For the velocity-tracking problem of the MWIP systems, we proposed two
sliding-mode-control (SMC) methods. There is still a steady tracking error when the
first SMC method is used. By assuming a novel sliding surface, the second SMC
method is designed to solve this problem. Using a coordinate transformation, the
non-“Class-I” type underactuated MWIP system is presented as a semistrict feedback
form which is convenient for controller design. A dynamic surface controller with
a nonlinear disturbance observer (DSCNDO) is then designed to solve the balance
control problem of the MWIP systems. The proposed DSCNDO can compensate the
external disturbances and the model uncertainties to improve the system performance
significantly. The stabilities of the closed-loop MWIP systems using the proposed
methods are proved by Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of all the methods is
verified by numerical simulations.

Introduction
In the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to controlling problems of mobile
wheeled inverted pendulum (MWIP) models, which are widely applied in the field of
autonomous robotics and intelligent vehicles [1–10]. The MWIP is a typical under-
actuated system, which is nonlinear and inherently unstable. This makes the control
of MWIP to be a very challengeable problem. On the other hand, there are a lot of

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
practical systems implemented based on MWIP models, including the JOE [5], the
Nbot [6], the Legway [7], the B2 [8], the Segway [9], the UW-Car [11] and so on.
These systems are characterized by the ability to balance on its two wheels and spin on
the spot. This additional maneuverability allows easy navigation on various terrains,
turning sharp corners and traversing small steps or curbs. In addition, the compact
structure design allows drivers to access most places that can only be accessed by
walkers in the past. Moreover, people can travel in short distances in a small area by
such kind of vehicles instead of by cars or by buggies that are more polluted.
Due to the nonlinear, underactuated and inherent unstable dynamics, the MWIP
models have attracted much attention in the field of control theory and engineering. It
should be noted that there are a lot of control methods have been applied in benchmark
underactuated systems including the inverted pendulum, the acrobot and the rotating
pendulum [12–15], whereas most of these methods are based on exact mathematical
models. Therefore, they are lack of robustness to model errors and external distur-
bances. In the practical applications, there are unavoidable uncertainties caused by
both internal and external effects. Therefore, the robust control of MWIP has to be
dealt with.
It is not easy to design robust controllers for nonlinear underactuated systems,
whose control problems have been proved to be challenging because the techniques
of fully actuated systems cannot be used directly. With the great efforts of researchers,
several robust control methods have been proposed for the underactuated system in the
recentyears.Thefirstcommon-usedrobustcontrolstrategyistheslidingmodecontrol
(SMC) technique. Sankaranarayanan [16] proposed a SMC algorithm to robustly
stabilize a class of underactuated mechanical systems that are not linearly controllable
and violate Brockett’s necessary condition for smooth asymptotic stabilization of the
equilibrium, with parametric uncertainties. Park et al. [17] proposed an adaptive
neural SMC method for trajectory tracking control of nonholonomic wheeled mobile
robots with model uncertainties and external disturbances. The second robust control
strategy discussed in this chapter is the dynamic surface control (DSC). In order to
avoid the “explosion of terms” problem of Integrator Backstepping controller and the
“chattering problem” of SMC controller, the DSC method was developed by Swaroop
et al. [18]. Recently, the DSC technique has been applied into the control of different
underactuated mechanical systems, including the underactuated marine vessels [19],
the inertia wheel pendulum, the translational oscillator with rotational actuator, the
acrobot [20] and so on. For the MWIP model, we investigated both the SMC and DSC
strategies in our previous studies [11,21,22].
To reduce the effect from uncertainties to the MWIP system, the nonlinear dis-
turbance observer (NDO) might be a candidate solution. It is found that using a
disturbance observer can further improve the robustness of controller. A NDO was
proposed by Mohammadi to manage the disturbance of nonlinear system, which
is applied for a four-degree of freedom selective compliance assembly robot arm
(SCARA) manipulator [23]. Chen proposed a NDO to deal with the disturbance of
nonlinear system [24], which is applied to tracking control of pneumatic artificial
muscle actuator by using DSC control method [25]. For an uncertain structural sys-
tems, Wei et al. proposed a new type of composite control scheme of disturbance

observer-based control and terminal SMC [26]. Yang et al. [27] for systems with
mismatched uncertainties proposed a SMC approach by using a novel sliding surface
based on a disturbance observer.
In this chapter, we first introduce the mathematical model of MWIP using
Lagrange motion equations in Section 9.2. The velocity SMC controller of the MWIP
with modeling uncertainties and external is designed in Section 9.3. In Section 9.4,
a new dynamic surface controller with nonlinear disturbance observer (DSCNDO)
is developed by combining conventional DSC and NDO techniques for the balanc-
ing control of MWIP system. For all these controllers, the stabilities of closed-loop
MWIP system are proved. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Modeling of mobile wheeled inverted pendulum
9.2.1
Derivation of dynamic model
The MWIP system is modeled as a one dimensional inverse pendulum which rotates
about the wheels’ axles. Hence, the body’s motion on a plane is determined by the
inclination and translational motion. Figure 9.1 shows the structure of an MWIP
system, where θw and θb are the wheel’s rotation angle and the inclination angle of
the body, respectively. The coordinates of the wheel and body are denoted by (xw, yw)
and (xb, yb), respectively. We suppose that the system moves on a slope with constant
but uncertain angle α, which is hard to be measured by sensors. To describe the
parameters of the MWIP system, some notations should be clarified first (see also
Figure 9.1):
1.
mb, mw—masses of the body and the wheel.
2.
Ib, Iw—moments of inertia of the body and the wheel.
3.
l—length between the wheel axle and the center of gravity of the body.

The positions and velocities of the wheel and the body can be given by
 xb = l sin θb + rwθw cos α
yb = l cos θb + rwθw sin α
,
 xw = rwθw cos α
yw = rwθw sin α
(9.1)
 ˙xb = l ˙θb cos θb + rw ˙θw cos α
˙yb = −l ˙θb sin θb + rw ˙θw sin α

 ˙xw = rw ˙θw cos α
˙yw = rw ˙θw sin α

The Lagrangian equation of motion is used for the derivation of the dynamic
equation. The kinetic, potential and dissipated energy and their contributions to the
dynamic equation are computed as follows.

The gravitational potential energy of the body and the wheel can be computed as

Therefore, the Lagrange function L is given by

By choosing the state variable as x =

T, the state model
of an MWIP system can be represented by
˙x1 = x3

(9.11b)
(m12 cos(x1 + α))˙x2 + m22˙x3 = −τ −Db(x3 −x2) + Gb sin x1
(9.11c)
Then we can get the vector form of this dynamic model:
M(x)˙x = F(x) + u
(9.12)
where
M(x) =

(9.16)
In the case of velocity control problem, the desired velocity θw
∗= x2∗is always
given in advance. The desired inclination angle of the body, x1∗, is then determined by
(9.16), whereas different body parameters and unknown slope angle result in different
inclination angle x1∗, which makes it impossible to compute the exact equilibrium
before the controller design. Normally, it is difficult to design a controller if we do not
know the exact equilibrium in advance. Especially in the case of using a linearized
model, we even cannot obtain such model because it is generated by linearizing
the nonlinear system around the equilibrium. This problem can be partially solved
by estimating the equilibrium using nominal system parameters without considering
any uncertainties, whereas the controller based on the estimated equilibrium cannot

guarantee that the system finally moves at the desired velocity, even if it is asymptotic
stable. This will be further discussed in the rest of this chapter.

corresponding parameter of the nominal system moving on a flat ground without any

9.3.1 Type-I sliding mode controller for MWIP
Two types of SMC controllers, Type-I and Type-II, will be discussed for the MWIP
system. We first introduce the design procedure of Type-I SMC controller for the
MWIP system. This controller design is based on full state feedback. The sliding
surface is defined as a weighted combination of position tracking error and velocity
tracking error, which is given by
s = λ1˜x1 + λ2˜x2 + ˜x3
(9.17)
where ˜xi = xi −ˆx∗
i are the tracking errors with i = 1, 2, 3 and coefficients λ1, λ2
are constants to be determined. As pointed out in the previous section, exact system
equilibriums cannot be obtained in advance. Hence we use nominal system parameters

(9.18)
The state trajectories can be driven to the sliding surface by choosing the control
law τ such that
s˙s ≤−η |s|
(9.19)
where η is a positive constant.
From (9.11), it follows that
M1(x)˙x2 + M2(x)˙x3 = −Dwx2 + Gb sin x1 + m12x3
2 sin(x1 + α) −˜M
(9.20)
where
M1(x) = m11 + m12 cos(x1 + α) ,
M2(x) = m22 + m12 cos(x1 + α)

to be bounded by some known function F1(x),

Note that the assumptions (9.27) and (9.28) are common-used in the SMC, which can
be found in [29].

If k has the bound defined by (9.30), then the sliding condition (9.19) is satisfied.
The controller (9.29) ensures that all system trajectories will reach the surface and
remain there in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. The next step
is to find appropriate coefficients λ1, λ2 that guarantee the trajectories are asymptot-
ically stable during the sliding phase. On the sliding surface, the closed-loop system
dynamics is represented by the combination of the sliding surface in the form s = 0

¯x∗are different because they are determined by different (9.16), (9.18) and (9.36),
respectively.
Theorem 9.2. For the MWIP system (9.11), design sliding surface (9.17) and con-
trol law (9.29). Assume inequalities M1(¯x∗), M2(¯x∗) > 0 and cos(¯x∗

coefficients λ1, λ2 satisfy
λ1, λ2 > 0,
λ2M2(¯x∗) −M1(¯x∗) < 0
(9.37)
then the closed-loop system is locally asymptotically stable around equilibrium ¯x∗.

equilibrium of linearized system (9.43) is asymptotically stable if we have

After computing the two derivatives in (9.44), we have

(9.47)
If we choose λ1, λ2 that satisfy (9.37), inequality (9.46) is then satisfied.
Because the MWIP system is required to move with a nearly upright body, the
values of M1(¯x∗) and M2(¯x∗) are usually positive if the slope angle is small enough.
The value of cos(¯x∗
1) is positive for the same reason. Hence, the assumptions of
Theorem 9.2 are naturally satisfied. It is found that if the coefficients λ1 and λ2
satisfy λ1 > 0, 0 < λ2 < min (1, m11/m22), then the assumptions (9.37) will hold.

9.3.2 Type-II sliding mode controller for MWIP
When using the Type-I SMC controller, the real equilibrium ¯x∗is usually different
from the desired equilibrium x∗, even if the closed-loop system is asymptotically
stable. This leads to a steady tracking error in the case of velocity control for MWIP
systems. To ensure an MWIP system can move at a desired velocity ˙θ ∗
w, a novel
sliding surface and the corresponding SMC controller design scheme is proposed in
this section.

The new sliding surface is given by

(9.49)
where coefficients μ1, μ2, μ3 are constants to be determined.
Define

¯M
,
ˆf2(x) = ˆa(x) + μ3ˆb(x)
ˆ¯M
(9.50)
and the estimation error caused by modeling uncertainty and disturbances is assumed
to be bounded by some known function F2(x),
 f2(x) −ˆf2(x)

(9.51)
Further, we assume that

ˆ¯M(x)

problem of uncertain equilibriums is solved by using a special sliding surface (9.49).
The third item of (9.49) plays an important role in avoiding uncertain equilibriums.
In fact, state z3 is the integration of state z4, which can eliminate the static tracking

Dynamic surface controller with nonlinear disturbance
observer for MWIP
In this section, we proposed a DSCNDO for the balance control of an MWIP sys-
tem. Compared with the linear controllers, larger stability region can be achieved
by applying the DSC strategy. The introduction of NDO enhances the robustness of
closed-loop MWIP system to model errors and external disturbances. Moreover, the
“explosion-term” problem is also avoided in the controller design.
Here we rewrite the dynamic model (9.9) as
⎧

b sin(θb) + Gb sin(θb) + τext2
(9.65)
where all model uncertainties and external disturbances are lumped to τext1 and τext2.

Nonlinear disturbance observer design for MWIP
To improve the robustness and control performance of the closed-loop MWIP control
system, it is necessary to apply a NDO estimating model uncertainties, frictions and
external disturbances. This subsection illustrates the design procedure of a NDO in
the MWIP system.
Considering the nonlinear underactuated system with disturbance, to simplify
the denotation, we rewrite (9.65) as vector form:
M(q) ¨q + N(q, ˙q) + F(˙q) = τ + τext
(9.66)
where

Let us assume that ˆM(q) and ˆN(q, ˙q) are the estimates of the actual M(q) and
N(q, ˙q), and that M(q) and N(q, ˙q) are the corresponding additive uncertainties
presented in the model of the MWIP. That is we have
 M(q) = ˆM(q) + M(q)
N(q, ˙q) = ˆN(q, ˙q) + N(q, ˙q)
(9.72)
The lumped disturbance vector τd is defined as
τd =
 τd1 τd2
T = τext −M(q) ¨q −N(q, ˙q) −F(˙q)
(9.73)
By this definition, the effect of all dynamic uncertainties, joint frictions and
external disturbances is lumped into a single disturbance vector τd. From (9.66), it is
seen that
ˆM(q) ¨q + ˆN(q, ˙q) = τ + τd
(9.74)
To estimate the lumped disturbance τd, the NDO is designed as
˙ˆτ d = −L(q, ˙q) ˆτd + L(q, ˙q)

ˆM(q) ¨q + ˆN(q, ˙q) −τ

(9.75)
Define ˜τd = τd −ˆτd as the disturbance tracking error and using (9.75), it is
observed that
˙ˆτ d = L(q, ˙q) ˜τd
(9.76)
or, equivalently
˙˜τ d = ˙τd −L(q, ˙q) ˜τd
(9.77)
In general, there is no prior information about the derivative of the disturbance τd.
When the disturbance varies slowly relative to the observer dynamics, it is reasonable
to suppose that ˙τd = 0. Therefore, we have
˙˜τ d = −˙ˆτd = −L(q, ˙q) ˜τd
(9.78)
Let us define an auxiliary variable z =
 z1 z2
T = ˆτd −p(q, ˙q), where
d
dt p(q, ˙q) = L(q, ˙q) ˆM(q) ¨q.
(9.79)
And substitute it to (9.75), the observer can be designed as

˙z = L(q, ˙q)

To analyze the type and features of the underactuated systems, we first introduce the

an underactuated system (9.87) Class-I underactuated system, if q2 is actuated. We
call it a Class-II underactuated system, if q2 is unactuated. In order words, for a
Class-I system τ1 = 0 and τ2 = 0 for a Class-II system.

In general, the DSC control design requests the strict or semistrict feedback form
of the nonlinear system model [18,25]. According to Lemma 9.1, the dynamics of a
Class-I underactuated mechanical system may be transformed into a cascade nonlin-
ear system in strict feedback form. However, the dynamics of a Class-II underactuated
system may only be transformed into a cascade nonlinear system in a quadratic
nontriangular form from Lemma 9.2. Similarly, the dynamics of an MWIP-type
underactuated system may not be transformed into a cascade nonlinear system in
strict feedback form. This makes it difficult to design a DSC controller for the MWIP
system.
In order to solve this problem, we propose a coordinate transformation approach
to transform an MWIP model into a cascade nonlinear system in semistrict feedback
form.

Proofofthetheoremissimilartotheworkin[32].Aftercoordinatetransformation
the MWIP system model is represented in a semistrict feedback form as cascade of
an outer (9.95b) and a core (9.95a) subsystem.
Assumption 9.1. The uncertainties and disturbances of the system are bounded and
satisfy
|τd1| ≤¯d1, |τd2| ≤¯d2, |˜τd1| ≤ξ1, |˜τd2| ≤ξ2
(9.96)
where ¯d1, ¯d2, ξ1 and ξ2 are known bounds.
Our purpose is to design a control u forcing x2 to be stabilized around zero.
Together with the proposed disturbance observer, for MWIP system (9.95) we design
a new DSCNDO as follows:

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
To analyze the stability of system (9.95) controlled by the proposed DSCNDO,
we first introduce the following lemma.
Lemma 9.3. [33]. For a nonlinear system (9.95), suppose that a positive definite
function V(x(t)) = V(t) satisfies the following differential inequality:
˙V(t) ≤−ςV + C
(9.108)
where constants ς and C satisfy ς > 0 and C ≥0. Then, for any given t0, function
V(t) satisfies the following inequality:
0 ≤V(t) ≤[C −(C −ςV(t0)) exp(−ς(t −t0))] /ς, ∀t ≥t0
(9.109)
This implies that V(t) is eventually bounded by C/ς, and the exponential convergence
rate of V(t) to the bound is ς. Thus, the state of the system (9.95) is uniformly and
ultimately bounded.
The stability analysis of the whole system is concluded in the following theorem:
Theorem 9.6. Considering a system (9.95) with modeling errors, external distur-
bance, unknown payloads and frictions, there exists a set of the surface gains k1, k2,
the filter time constant τ4 and the observer gains c1, c2, c3, c4 satisfying

By the selections of k1, k2, τ4 and c1, c2, c3, c4, we can make γ > M1/2p. This results
in ˙V ≤0 on V = p. Thus, V ≤p is an invariant set, i.e., if V(0) ≤p then V(t) ≤p
for all t ≥0. Therefore, V(t) is bounded, so are S1, S2, e and ˜τd1, ˜τd2. According to
above analysis and Lemma 9.3, the overall closed-loop control system is semiglobally
uniformly and ultimately bounded. This completes the proof.

Simulation of SMC for MWIP
Consider an MWIP system whose exactly known system parameters are listed in
Table 9.1. To test the robustness of the proposed controllers, it is assumed that the
actual physical parameters of the body are different from that of the nominal system.
Table 9.2 shows the actual and nominal body parameters.An LQR controller designed
by linearizing nominal system was found cannot stabilize the actual system.

surface (9.17). Therefore, the final SMC controller (9.29) can be obtained from

approach. If the physical parameters of MWIP system are very close to that of the
nominal system, the maximum slope we achieved in the simulation is about 45 degree.
This also demonstrates the robustness of proposed approach. Compared with theType-
I SMC controller, the most significant advantage of the Type-II SMC controller is its
ability to eliminate the steady tracking error.
9.5.2
Simulation of DSCNDO for MWIP
In this simulation, we use the same parameter assumptions as given in the previous
subsection. The dissipation parameter Dw is assumed to be Gaussian random variable
with known covariance (0.2 N s/m) and mean value (0.5 N s/m). And the external
disturbances are assumed as:
τext1 = 30 sin (2t + π/2)(N m), τext2 = 0.2 sin (t)(N m).

An obvious equilibrium of the MWIP system can be easily obtained:
x∗= [x2

∗, x4

Based on (9.111) and Tables 9.1 and 9.2, the controller parameters are chosen as
k1 = 6,
k2 = 6,
τ4 = 0.1,
c1 = c4 = 100,
c2 = c3 = 0.

System trajectories of using DSCNDO, DSC and LQR control strategies

The equilibrium control simulation results of the actual MWIP system with consider-
ing any uncertainties and disturbances using DSCNDO, DSC and LQR controller
are shown in Figure 9.5. Suppose that the initial conditions of the system are
x(0) = [−0.2617, 0, 0]T.
As shown in Figure 9.5, the LQR controller cannot suppress the effect of system
uncertainties and disturbance. The two DSC controllers have better performance than
the LQR controller. Note that although the DSC controllers can make the state vari-
ables to be semiglobally uniformly and ultimately bounded, they do not guarantee that
the states converge to the desired value. There are small oscillations in the response
trajectories all the time due to the external disturbances. Compared with a pure DSC
controller, the control performance seems better when using a DSCNDO because the
amplitudes of oscillations are significantly reduced.

In a word, the simulation results show that the DSCNDO controller is more
effective than a pure DSC or LQR controller when there exists model uncertainties
and external disturbances.

Conclusion
Robust controller design for underactuated systems is a hard problem. In this chap-
ter, we proposed two kinds of robust controllers for the MWIP, which is a typical
underactuated system. The first kind of robust controllers is based on SMC, which is
very suitable for the MWIP suffering from both parameter uncertainties and external
disturbances. With a specially designed sliding surface, the proposed SMC controller
not only stabilizes the MWIP but also eliminates the steady tracking error even the
equilibrium is uncertain.
Considering the deficiency of chattering in SMC controllers, a novel global
coordinate transformation was proposed to achieve the DSC control of an MWIP
system. The proposed method partially solves the difficulty in designing a DSC
controller for a non-Class-I type underactuated mechanical system. To compensate
for parametric uncertainties in a real MWIP-based robot system as well as external
disturbances, we combined the proposed DSC controller and an NDO. The efficiency
of all proposed controllers is validated by numerical simulations.

Case studies on non-linear control theory
of the inverted pendulum
Xu Xu1, Hongwei Zhang1, and Giuseppe Carbone1
Abstract
This chapter deals with the control of inverted pendulums through non-linear control
theory. Simulations of the proposed control method are carried out in MATLAB®
environment with satisfactory results in controlling systems of single and double-link
inverted pendulum installed in a cart, for a range of starting positions. The proposed
control technique can be extended to the control of many other non-linear systems.
Examples are proposed as referring to design and teaching applications. In particular,
a single inverted pendulum system constructed using Lego bricks and controlled by
Lego Mindstorms EV3 is used to prove the user-friendliness of the proposed control
method as implemented by Master students at Sheffield Hallam University. Moreover,

Introduction
The control of inverted pendulums and cart systems is a widely addressed topic in
control literature, such as reported in [1–3]. In fact, the above-mentioned non-linear
systems are highly unstable, and they cannot maintain the upright position without an
appropriate control. One approach to the control problem of an inverted pendulum on
a cart is to linearise the system locally around the upright position by approximating
the non-linear terms to linear ones. Traditionally, inverted pendulum systems are
controlled by an open-loop swing up controller forcing the pendulum to reach the
top equilibrium, and then switching to a closed-loop linear controller to control the
pendulum from this point to maintain the upright position [3,4]. Some more recent
publications, such as in [5,6], the authors proposed non-linear techniques to extend the
stability region to a bigger neighbourhood of the upright position, but these methods

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
still involved switching between at least two control strategies and are not in the
true sense of global control. For a comprehensive and thorough review of non-linear
control strategies in controlling inverted pendulum systems, we refer the readers to
Boubaker’s survey article in 2013 [7].
In this chapter, we study an approach to non-linear control theory that is based
on a generalisation of the linear quadratic optimal control theory. This approach
gives approximations to non-linear optimal control systems, by solving a Riccati
equation. There is a brief introduction of the theory, and detailed derivation of it can
be found in [8–10]. The inverted pendulum and cart control problem can be solved
by applying this non-linear control technique, so the pendulum can be controlled
globally. In particular, this non-linear control technique can be easily applied to more
complicated versions of the inverted pendulum and cart family: multi-link inverted
pendulum and cart systems, which has not been reported in the existing literature.
In Section 10.2, a single-link pendulum is modelled and analysed. This is then
extended to a double-link pendulum (the general case being similar), and Lagrange’s
equations for the system are derived. In Section 10.3.1, linearized equations of the
pendulum (where the mass is concentrated at the top) in the form of
˙x = Ax + Bu
(10.1)
are studied. If matrices A and B form a controllable pair, then the local optimal
feedback control u is given by
u = −R−1BTPx,
(10.2)
where, P satisfies the algebraic Riccati equation and R is a weighting matrix. In
Section 10.3.2, the global pendulum model in the form of
˙x = A(x)x + B(x)u,
(10.3)
and the corresponding controllability of (A(x) , B(x)) for ‘almost all’ x (i.e. control-
lable, apart possibly from a set of measure zero [11]) are analysed. The x in A(x)
and B(x) is fixed for each step; therefore, the non-linear model resembles the linear
case for one step. This method also demonstrates effective robust control because
of the update at each step, so any inaccuracy of A and B is adjusted automatically.
Furthermore, the global control u is shown to be
u = −R−1B(x)T P(x)x,
(10.4)
where P(x) satisfies the pointwise algebraic Riccati equation:
AT(x) P(x) + P(x) A(x) + Q −P(x) B(x) R−1B(x)T P(x) = 0,
(10.5)
where Q and R are weighting matrices. In Section 10.4, some simulation examples are
demonstrated to verify the above non-linear control theory of the inverted pendulum.
It is shown that the single pendulum installed on a cart can be controlled from a
large range of initial positions, including the rest position where the pendulum hangs
downwards. The double-link pendulum and car system can also be controlled from
many initial positions.

Case studies on non-linear control theory of the inverted pendulum
227
Case studies have been proposed for demonstrating the proposed control architec-
ture with single and double pendulums. In particular, in Section 10.5, a single inverted
pendulum system constructed using Lego bricks and controlled by Lego Mindstorms
EV3 is used to prove the user-friendliness of the proposed control method as imple-
mented by Master students at Sheffield Hallam University. Then in Section 10.6,
a case study has been proposed as referring to a 3 degrees of freedom parallel manip-
ulator CaPaMan (Cassino Parallel Manipulator), which is designed to replace a cart
and provide three dimensional motions to an inverted pendulum while minimising
dynamics effects at design stage.
10.2
Modelling of the cart–pendulum systems
Often inverted pendulums are considered in combination with moving carts. The
system of a single pendulum installed on a cart is drawn in Figure 10.1.
The dynamical model of the cart and the pendulum are equations of motions
often obtained by applying force analysis using free body diagrams and Newton’s
second law F = ma. However, there are other methods available for achieving a
system’s dynamical model, for example the Lagrangian approach which calculates
the difference between total kinetic energy T and the total potential energy Vof the
system:
L = T −V
(10.6)
and the Hamiltonian equation which calculates the sum of the two types of energy:
H = T + V.
(10.7)
It is usually easier to use the Lagrangian method than the one based on force analysis
because all is required are the generalised kinetic and potential energy terms, so
resolving of the forces (which is often complicated) is not needed. We adopt the

(10.8)
where xi represents the ith generalised coordinate and fi the ith generalised force

laws [14].
In the case of a single pendulum–cart system, there are two x variables shown
in Figure 10.1, namely the horizontal distance x1 (m) travelled by cart from the left
reference, and the angle θ (rad) between the pendulum rod and the vertical axis. ˙x1
and ˙θ represent velocity of the cart along the horizontal axis and angular velocity of
the rod around the rod-cart connection point, respectively. Here,
f1 = u, f2 = 0.

where m1 and m2 are the masses of cart and of pendulum, respectively, r denotes the

of the system, using the bottom of the pendulum rest position as the vertical reference
point, can be written as
V = m2g(r + r cos θ).

One particular advantage of this method is that it can be easily extended to a general
multi-link pendulum case, without the need to perform complex force analysis on the
new and previous pendulum objects. For example a double pendulum and cart system
is illustrated in Figure 10.2, where θ1 and θ2 represent the angles between the first
and the second pendulum rods and the vertical axis and u denotes the force (control)
applied on the cart.
A similar energy analysis can be performed as before. Using the new vertical and

where m3 denotes the mass of the newly added pendulum, and r1 and r2 are the
lengths of the original rod and the new rod, respectively. The energy equations appear
complicated; however, the analysis performed above is relatively straightforward in
the sense that effect only comes from the new pendulum and corresponding energy
terms can simply be added to the original equations.
The process of obtaining a state-space model for the double-link pendulum cart
system is also similar as the one is the single pendulum case. By solving the Lan-
grange’s equation in (10.8) and splitting each differential equation with a second
derivative into two equations containing only first derivatives (i.e. let x2 = ˙x1, x3 = θ1,
x4 = ˙x3, x5 = θ2 and x6 = ˙x5), we obtain standard state-space model of the double-link

Having now obtained the mathematical models (state-space representations) of the
single pendulum installed on a cart and the double-link pendulum and cart system,
we shall discuss how to achieve linear and non-linear quadratic optimal controls of
the systems in theory in Sections 10.3.1 and 10.3.2, respectively.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
10.3
Control analysis
10.3.1
Linear control analysis
A general linear control system has the following form:
˙x = Ax + Bu,
(10.27)
where x is the state variable vector, u is the control vector and (A, B) is a controllable
pair, or at least a stabilisable pair, to guarantee finite solutions of the Ricatti equation
(see later for details). Linearised equations of the pendulum–cart system where the
mass is concentrated at the top are in the form of (10.27).
The quadratic infinite-time cost function [3]:
J = 1
2
 ∞
0
(xTQx + uTRu)dt
(10.28)
leads to the linear optimal feedback control solution:
u = −R−1BTPx,
(10.29)
where R is a weighting matrix and P is a positive-definite Hermitian or real symmetric
matrix. P satisfies the algebraic Riccati equation:
ATP + PA + Q −PBR−1BTP = 0.
(10.30)
The above Riccati equation can be solved using the LQR (linear-quadratic regula-
tor) function in MATLAB [3]. To implement the optimal control solution, substitute
(10.29) into (10.27), we obtain
˙x = Ax −BR−1BTPx
= [A −BR−1BTP]x,
(10.31)
which is a stable controlled system in the linearised case [3], as long as the condition
of the observability of the pair (Q
1
2 , A) is satisfied.
In the cases of the two inverted pendulum and cart systems analysed in Sec-
tion 10.2, the non-linear state-space models of the systems can be considered as linear
representations when the inverted pendulums are kept in a small neighbourhood of
the vertical upright position. Then, for the single pendulum–cart case, we can assume
that x3 and x4 (which is ˙x3) are small quantities, and the following approximations
can be made:
sin x3 ≈x3, cos x3 ≈1, sin2 x3 ≈0 and x2
4 sin x3 = ˙x2
3 sin x3 ≈0.
(10.32)
The linearised state-space model can be simplified substantially from (10.14) and can
then be written into the form of (10.27), where

Similarly, for the double-pendulum–cart system, to achieve the linearised state-space
model, we also assume that x3, x4, x5 and x6 are small such that
sin x3 ≈x3, sin x5 ≈x5, cos x3 ≈cos x5 ≈1, sin2 x3 ≈sin2 x5 ≈0, cos2 x3 ≈cos2 x5
≈1, sin2(x3 −x5) ≈0 and x2
4 sin x3 ≈x2
4 sin x5 ≈x2
6 sin x3 ≈x2
6 sin x5 ≈0.
(10.34)
These approximations simplify the state-space model of the double-link pendulum
and cart system into the linearised form of (10.27), where

The linear models represent the systems adequately when the starting positions
of the inverted pendulums are near the vertical upright positions. Because the linear
optimal feedback controlled systems are stable at the equilibriums where x = 0, the
linear representations of the systems will always be valid as long as the initial positions
arewithinasmallneighbourhoodoftheverticaluprightposition. Iftheinitialpositions
are not within this range, however, the linear models obtained in this section are not
close approximations of the original systems and the control solutions achieved in
(10.29) do not provide satisfactory control.
Traditionally, the inverted pendulum systems are controlled by an open-loop
swing up controller forcing the pendulum to reach the top equilibrium, and then
switching to a linear feedback controller (e.g. a linear quadratic optimal controller
as the one we discussed in this section) to control the pendulum from this point. In
Section 10.3.2, we shall consider and analyse a freezing technique to control non-
linear dynamical systems originally introduced by Banks and Mhana in 1992 [8],
using the theory of linear quadratic optimal control. The inverted pendulum systems
can be controlled from a much wider range of starting positions by applying this
non-linear optimal control technique.
10.3.2
Non-linear control analysis
A general non-linear control system can be represented by the following:
˙x = ˜f (x, u),
x(0) = x0.
(10.36)
If ˜f (x, u) is a linear-analytic function, the general non-linear system equation shown
in (10.36) is equivalent to
˙x = f (x) + g(x)u,
(10.37)
where f (x) and g(x) are non-linear, analytic functions and the controller u is affine.

234
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
If ˜f (x, u) is not a linear-analytic function, the system can always be written in the
linear analytic form presented in (10.37) as long as the mild condition of the controller
function u being differentiable is satisfied, although the trade-off is the increase of the
dimensionality of the state space. This is done by introducing a new control function
v such that
˙u = v.
(10.38)
Then a new state variable y can be defined as
y =
x
u

.
(10.39)
Now a new system representing the original one in (10.36) but in linear analytic form
can be written as
˙y =
˜f (x, u)
v

=

˜˜f (y)
0

+
0
I

v
= f (y) + g(y)v,
(10.40)
where I is the identity matrix and the new controller v is affine. It can be seen now
that (10.40) is of the same form as (10.37), even though the new state space has a
higher dimension.
Note that in the cases when ˜f (x, u) is not linear-analytic and the technique of
rewriting the system into a linear-analytic one as explained above is adopted, the new
controller function v determined might not be the optimal control for the original
system, as the original system might have a non-differentiable control u which works
better. However, this situation is rare, as the optimal controller would be differentiable
for the vast majority of physical systems. So most physical system models obtained
are either in linear-analytic form or can be easily rewritten into a higher dimensional
linear-analytic function, and this process does not affect the solution of the optimal
controller.
The non-linear function f (x) can be taken out of (10.37) for further analysis. The
function f (x) can be written analytically into a matrix function
f (x) = A(x)x,
(10.41)
provided it satisfies the condition
f (x) = 0
at
x = 0.
(10.42)
The above condition essentially means that the non-linear system ˙x = f (x) has an
equilibrium at the origin. This condition is true for at least one of the models of
any real system. For example in the single or multi-link inverted pendulum system,
an unstable equilibrium exists at x = 0, where the cart is not moving, and all the
pendulum mass is at the top (i.e. the angles are 0).

Case studies on non-linear control theory of the inverted pendulum
235
Then by substituting (10.41) into (10.37), the non-linear control system of (10.37)
can be written as
˙x = A(x)x + B(x)u,
(10.43)
if B(x) = g(x). In the case when the system function in (10.36) is not analytic, but
the control u is differentiable, g(x) is simply
0
I

as shown in (10.40) and is linear.
One important point to note is that the non-linear state-space representation
(10.43) of the system is not unique. If the function f (x) is analytic, then it has a
convergent Taylor’s series such that
f (x) =
∞

i=0

i!

∂xi f (0) xi =
∞

i=0
f (i)(0)
i!
xi,
(10.44)
where xi = xi1
1 , xi2
2 , . . . xinn [15]. The Taylor series starts with a constant term for any
function, but if f (0) = 0, it means the constant term for the function f is 0 in this
case, then every other term is a polynomial which contains at least one x (x1 or x2 or
x3 . . .). This is true for most physical systems, as discussed earlier for the equilibrium
condition in (10.42). Then take each homogeneous component, i.e. take all powers of
order one (linear terms) and then all power of order two (quadratic terms) and so on.
That means, in any one of those homogeneous polynomials, there are always terms
with at least one x (x1 or x2 or x3) in it. Then an ‘x’ can be pulled out to form the
matrix A(x).
For any system which satisfied the origin equilibrium condition stated in (10.42),
a representation in the form of (10.43) can always be found, but this representation is
non-unique. A simple example to demonstrate this fact is shown below:
Example 10.1
An analytic system is governed by the following differential equations:
˙x1 = x1x2
˙x2 = x2 + u2.
(10.45)
The equations can be written in matrix form as

(10.47)
Although the two state-space matrices are different, they represent differential equa-
tions which are equivalent. It can be seen from this example that the state-space model
of a system is not unique. Depending on how the matrix is split out of the differential
equations, there are often many valid mathematical representations of the same sys-
tem, although some are more physical than others, or are expected to lead to simpler
control calculations and implementations.

236
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
Once a state-space model of the non-linear system is constructed in the form
of (10.43), the global non-linear control theory [8,9] states that by attaching the
generalised quadratic infinite time optimal cost function
J = 1
2
 ∞
0
(xTQ(x)x + uTR(x)u)dt
(10.48)
to (10.42), it generates the non-linear optimal control solution:
u∗= −R−1(x)BT(x)P(x)x,
(10.49)
where P(x) satisfies the algebraic Riccati equation:
AT(x)P(x) + P(x)A(x) + Q(x) −P(x)B(x)R−1(x)BT(x)P(x) = 0.
(10.50)
The optimal stabilising control can be obtained by substituting (10.49) into (10.43)
to produce a coupled control system:
˙x = A(x)x −B(x)R−1(x)BT(x)P(x)x
= [A(x) −B(x)R−1(x)BT(x)P(x)]x.
(10.51)
To solve the equations in (10.51) numerically, an integration method for each time
step can be used. For example the Euler’s method or the fourth order Runge–Kutta
method can be adopted for the inverted pendulum cases.
We use a freezing technique to solve for the next step of x iteratively using an
integration method. Starting at x(0) (which is a known chosen initial state), A(x(0))
and B(x(0)) are then fixed matrices at this initial step. MATLAB provides a LQR
solution for P(x(0)) after solving the algebraic Riccati equation because at each time
step for a fixed x, the system becomes essentially the same as the linear case, so linear
control theory can be easily applied. Now substitute A(x(0)), B(x(0)) and P(x(0)) into
(10.51) to solve for the next x, say x(1). Then having obtained x(1), the same process
can be repeated for the next step and so on for the system.
One point to bear in mind is that as we discussed earlier in this section, the state-
space representation A(x) of any system is not unique, so the state-space solution of
the controlled system x may also vary. In the case of the single inverted pendulum,
for example, even if we still adopt the Lagrangian approach to obtain the equations of
motions given by (10.14) in Section 10.2, it is possible to write a different state-space
model in matrix by splitting the x from each equation of (10.15) differently.Therefore,
the global non-linear optimal control solution (10.51) obtained by using the freezing
technique is not unique, because the model of the inverted pendulum–cart system
can be different to the one used for the control analysis. In Example 10.1, it is seen
that, in the first representation, the system is totally uncontrollable and the second is
controllable apart from on the set where x1 = 0, which is of two-dimensional measure
zero. Therefore, the controllability of the original system varies, depending on the
state-space model written.
In the linear control case for a single inverted pendulum, the closed-loop pen-
dulum control needs an initial position of x3(0) = 0, i.e. the pendulum mass is
concentrated at the top of the rod, or x3(0) ≈0, i.e. the mass is within a small neigh-
bourhood of the top position so the approximations of sin x3 ≈x3 and cos x3 ≈1 are

Case studies on non-linear control theory of the inverted pendulum

true to linearise the system state-space model. To reach this initial position, either
the pendulum is manually placed, or an open-loop swinging up control is usually
implemented.
In the non-linear control case, the pendulum can start from any initial position
apart from two initial states of x3 = ± π
2 because (A(x), B(x)) is unstabilisable at these
two positions [9,16]. But (A(x), B(x)) is controllable for all other x and in the rare
situationwhenthependulumdoesstartfromthetwoanglesstatedabove, thependulum
will fall slightly due to gravity and hence changing the value of x2 to other values
than ± π
2 . Then the non-linear optimal stabilising control will kick in to control the
pendulum. Therefore, we say this condition does not change the overall controllability
of (A(x), B(x)) and the pendulum system is controllable for ‘almost all’ x. In higher
order systems, such as the multi-link inverted pendulum systems, the nature of the
uncontrollable subspace will be more complicated and will require further analysis.
Another advantage of this non-linear global control method, apart from the fact
that it can be controlled from nearly any position, is that it is intrinsically robust. This
is because unlike the linear case, any inaccuracy in the modelling of A and B can be
taken account of and corrected at each time step and would therefore not affect the
eventual control result. To implement the control in real time, a powerful computer is
needed to solve the Riccati equation within the required time.
The control of inverted pendulum system is a benchmark in testing the general
non-linear optimal control theory discussed above.This method does not only apply to
the pendulum system but also to any general non-linear control systems, for example
aeronauticalsystems[8]orshipsystems[17]. Itisalsoworthnotingthatthereareother
techniques for solving non-linear control problems, for example a linear, time-varying
approximation approach introduced in [18]. In the next section, we will demonstrate
some simulation results of the single and double-link inverted pendulum and cart
control systems, using the non-linear optimal control method discussed in this section.
10.4
Simulations for single and double pendulum control
We use a fourth order Runge–Kutta method (because of its high accuracy) to calculate
and to apply the optimal control solutions to the inverted pendulum and cart systems
numerically in MATLAB.The non-linear control theory and the simulation principles
are discussed in Section 10.3.2. Simulation results for the single-pendulum and cart
controlled system defined in (10.14) in Section 10.2 are plotted in Figures 10.3–10.5.
Figures 10.6 and 10.7 display the simulation results for the double-pendulum and
cart-controlled system presented in Section 10.2.
For the single pendulum and cart simulation, the parameters used are: mass of
the cart: 2 kg, mass of the pendulum: 0.1 kg and the rod length 0.5 m. For the double
pendulum and cart simulation, the parameters are: mass of the cart: 2 kg, mass of the
first pendulum: 0.1 kg, mass of the second pendulum: 0.1 kg and both of the rods are
0.1 m long.
Sample MATLAB codes are attached in Appendix A for the convenience of the
readers.

Introduction
As a classical control problem, inverted pendulum provides a good understanding
about control techniques of non-linear systems and their linearisation approaches.
Controlling of inverted pendulum system lays strong background for a control engi-
neer, and the depth of the inverted pendulum study can be varying from undergraduate
level to the postgraduate level. There are many inverted pendulum systems developed
for educational purposes, for example the Quanser Linear Servo Cart with the Inverted
Pendulum(asshowninFigure10.8), theQuanserRotaryInvertedPendulum(asshown
in Figure 10.9) and the Feedback Instruments Digital Inverted Pendulum (as shown in
Figure 10.10) are very popular among the equipment offered by engineering teaching
equipment providers. Many universities and researchers around the world have also
designed and built their own inverted pendulum systems [19–21] to suit different
teaching needs and research investigations. In recent years, rapid advancements in
microprocessor technology have led to the development of many inverted pendulums
controlled by microcontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and PIC controllers

pendulum development is using the LEGO Mindstorms kit [25–27].

LEGO Mindstorms EV3
Initially designed as a toy for school children, LEGO Mindstorms is now widely used
in university education and research, attracting applications in many areas, including
artificial intelligence, embedded systems, control systems, robotics and operating
systems. In additional to the characteristics that they are inexpensive, easily reconfig-
urable, reprogrammable, versatile and robust, another unique benefit of using LEGO
Mindstorms is that the complete inverted pendulum system can be constructed and
controlled by LEGO Mindstorms kit including over 500 TECHNIC elements for

capability through Wi-Fi are new features of the EV3 brick. There were many
software and programming languages which can communicate with the LEGO Mind-
storms. LabVIEW, MATLAB & Simulink®, RobotC for Mindstorms, C++ are the
most common programming platforms and languages used in LEGO Mindstorms
[31,32]. Mindstorms EV3 can use Bluetooth or wired USB connection for short-
range communication and Wi-Fi facilitates for long-range networking. For the Wi-Fi
communications, EV3 brick needs to connect with an external Wi-Fi dongle, and the
only supported Wi-Fi module with the LEGO Mindstorms platform is NETGEAR
N150 (WNA1100) Wireless Adapter [31].
LEGO Mindstorms EV3 has four output ports and four input ports which can
measure the data up to 1000 samples per second. The system has 16 MB of flash
memory, inbuilt 64 MB RAM and enables to extend the memory up to 32 GB by a
mini HDSC memory card reader [31]. The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 has two large
interactiveservomotorswithencoders, amediumservomotor, acoloursensor, atouch
sensor (two state pressure sensor), a gyro sensor and an IR sensor [31].
10.5.3
Construction of LEGO inverted pendulum
The most popular LEGO inverted pendulum was the so-called Gyro Boy which is
a self-balancing Segway on two wheels (as shown in Figure 10.11). Gyro Boy uses
a combination of the large servo motors’ encoders working with the Gyro sensor
to balance itself upright. LEGO provided the user with complex example models,
such as Gyro Boy, as an inspiration of what can be built and controlled with LEGO
MINDSTORMS.The robot also responds to commands and feedback from the colour
sensor and the ultrasonic sensor.
More traditional inverted pendulum applications have also been developed using
either LEGO Mindstorms NXT or EV3. As shown in Figure 10.12, a single inverted

measure the angle of the pendulum and two large servo motors were used to control the
cart as well as providing the cart displacement measurements. They have also devel-
opedaLEGOEV3rotaryinvertedpendulumsystemasshowninFigure10.13[34–36].

Figure 10.14
Single inverted pendulum on a cart based on the Lego Mindstorms
EV3
Figure 10.14 has shown the structure of the single inverted pendulum that was
built using simple LEGO bricks, and the pendulum was attached onto the cart which
was also made from LEGO bricks. With two heavy wheels on top, the centre of
gravity of the pendulum was assumed at the top of pendulum. Two side bars were
used for the protection of the brick screen and the pendulum. Pendulum was attached
to the rotatable wheel on cart, and it could slow down the pendulum by using gears
if required. Two large servo motors were used to move the cart, and the position of
the cart was measured with the feedback from the motors’encoders. The Gyro sensor
was used for measuring the angle and the angular velocity of the pendulum. The
physical parameters of the LEGO-based single inverted pendulum system are shown
in Table 10.1.
10.5.4
Controller design and Simulink model
Controller was designed in MATLAB and Simulink while Wi-Fi network connec-
tion was used to communicate the measurement and control information with the
EV3 brick. The LEGO Mindstorms Simulink support package was used to develop
the Simulink model as shown in Figure 10.15. The pendulum angle was obtained
from taking an integration to the output from the Gyro sensor (in degrees/s). The
cart position was measured by the other two large motors’ encoders. The encoder

gain element after the encoder blocks. The cart position was measured in lengths but
the obtained measurement was from the angle for the wheels. Therefore, angle mea-
surements were converted into length. Low-pass filter was used before the position
signals were differentiated. The Simulink controller used a MATLAB-function, as
shown in Figure 10.16, which was using the four-state variables described in (10.14)
as inputs and calculate the control signal using the non-linear optimal control method
introduced in Section 10.3.2.
10.5.5
Experimental results
Experimental results of the controlled single inverted pendulum and cart system, using
the non-linear optimal control method and the Runge–Kutta integration method, are
presented in Figure 10.17, where pendulum started at initial position of 10◦(π/18).
Sampling time was set at 0.1 s. The speed of the two large motors was controlled
using calculated controller output between a range of −100 to 100 as a percentage
of the full speed (at 160 rpm) where the negative sign indicates reverse rotation. The
outputs of the Gyro sensor were all integers in degree/s, thus the staircase shape of the
graphs. The experiment results show that the inverted pendulum could stabilise fairly
and quickly, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the non-linear optimal control
method.

Case study 2 – a parallel manipulator as the cart
A parallel kinematic manipulator is a mechanical system that uses several serial chains
to support a single movable platform, or end-effector. They are investigated and
implemented in several application tasks ranging from industrial manipulations to
service robotics, as described for example in [37]. There is a wide range of design
solutions for PKM according to their specific application(s) also. A successful PKM
laboratory prototype is CaPaMan. This robot has been built in several different design
versions, and it has been investigated for various applications including, for example,
robotic surgery [38] or earthquake shaking tests [39].

Figure 10.18(a) and (b) shows, respectively, a kinematic model of CaPaMan and
a built prototype, which has a two links mechanism on its movable plate. CaPaMan
is composed of a movable plate MP that is connected to a fixed plate FP by means of
three identical articulated parallelograms AP, whose coupler carries a prismatic joint

SJ and a spherical joint BJ, as shown in the scheme of Figure 10.18(a). This specific
kinematic architecture allows to keep the motors on the fixed base to reduce inertial
forces. Additionally, the number of active degrees of freedom is limited to 3 while
6 degrees of mobility can be achieved with coupled motions of the movable plate.
For example a synchronised motion of the three motors will allow a vertical motion
along Z-axis coupled with a rotation about Z-axis.
Table 10.2 reports the values of main sizes of CaPaMan as referring to the model
in Figure 10.18. A detailed modelling of CaPaMan, including close loop direct kine-
matics formulation, has been described, for example, in [40]. In particular, direct
kinematics can provide the following expression for the centre point H of MP as

The sign ambiguity in (10.53) for ψ, θ and ϕ is solved when the values of z1 and z
give the up and down orientation of the mobile plate and, therefore, the sign −or +
is chosen, respectively.
In this chapter, CaPaMan is considered as a cart of an inverted pendulum, such as
shown in Figure 10.18(b). Accordingly, (10.52) and (10.53) have been expressed as
a function of Hk coordinates yk, zk (k = 1, 2, 3), which can be given by the geometry
of Figure 10.18(a) from the input variable αk
yk = bk cos αk
(10.54)
zk = bk sin αk + hk
so that they can be considered the input coordinates for the platform motion.
The symmetry characteristics of CaPaMan architecture have been useful to for-
mulate analytical dynamic equations to compute the input torques as reported in [40].
Assumptions have been made in order to simplify the equations such as the effects
of link elasticity and viscous damping of the joints have been neglected; links are
assumed to be rigid bodies and the joints are frictionless and have no clearance.
In addition, only the inertial effects of the movable platform have been considered
since the legs of parallel architectures are lighter than the movable plate. Based on
the above-mentioned assumption, the only forces that are applied to the rods CB by
the mobile platform are those, which are contained in the plane of the articulated
parallelogram, i.e. Fky and Fkz as shown in Figure 10.19.
The Fkx component determines the sliding of the prismatic joint along sk
coordinate. Thus, the components of the resultant force F and torque N can be
computed as

Equations (10.55) and (10.56) can be solved in a closed form to obtain an explicit
expression for forces Fky and Fkz. Referring to Figure 10.19 and once the reaction
forces in the spherical joints Hk are computed, the torque τ Pk (k = 1, 2, 3) on the
input crank shaft of each articulated parallelogram can be obtained by considering
only the inertial effects of the movable platform in the form

where bk, ck and hk are the geometrical dimensions shown in Figure 10.19; Fky and

the inverse dynamics of the CaPaMan can be determined by including a kinetostatic
analysis of the articulated parallelograms. The reaction forces, centres of mass of the
links and inertial forces can be identified by using free body diagrams as proposed
in the schemes of Figure 10.19. Further details on the dynamic modelling and path
planning of CaPaMan can be found in [40].
Simulations have been carried out by using the formulation in (10.12)–(10.14),
(10.27), (10.29), (10.36), (10.37) and (10.40) in order to control an inverted pendulum

accommodated on the movable plate of CaPaMan. Calculations through (10.41)–
(10.43) have been made to compute the initial position and velocity of the movable
plate. Results of the controlled inverted pendulum and cart system, using the non-
linear optimal control method and the Runge–Kutta integration method, are presented
in Figure 10.20, where pendulum started at initial positions x3 = π
4 and x5 = π
4 .
It shows that the inverted pendulum was able to stabilise fairly quickly.
It is to note that the presence of disturbances due to the initial cart dynamics
can be minimised by statically/dynamically balancing the CaPaMan cart system. The
dynamic balancing can be achieved using several methods such as using
●
counter-rotary counter-masses;
●
separate counter-rotations;
●
idler loops;
●
duplicated mechanisms/movements;
●
counterweights on the movable links;
●
harmonic balancing by two counter-rotating masses.
A case study as referring to CaPaMan 2bis (Cassino Parallel Manipulator version 2bis)
has been carried out in [42]. Given the architecture of CaPaMan, one can use a total
of six Counter-Rotary Counterweights and three Counterweights. A constant linear
momentum can be obtained if the total centre of mass is stationary. For a proper
balancing, one can impose a stationary centre of mass and search for the design
parameters that can reduce to zero (or at least minimise) the moments of inertia,
shaking forces and shaking moments, as reported in [42].

Conclusions
In this chapter, we have studied a freezing technique to control non-linear systems
globally in general. We have shown two specific examples by using the non-linear
optimal control technique: a single inverted pendulum and cart system and a two-link
inverted pendulum and cart system. We have demonstrated good control results of
the two pendulum systems in simulations. Two case studies further demonstrating
the effectiveness of the non-linear control method have also been illustrated in this
chapter. The theory presented in this chapter extends to multi-link pendulum control
systems and indeed many other non-linear systems, e.g. aeronautical systems [8] or
ship systems [17]. Note that we have only considered the control problem in this
chapter, but not the state estimation problem. It is assumed that there is an effective
state estimator for the optimal feedback control. It is also worth noting that there
are other techniques for solving non-linear control problems, for example, a linear,
time-varying approximation approach introduced in [18]. Future work will be focused
on studying the non-uniqueness problem, and the identification of the uncontrollable
subspace and how to avoid it.

Bipedal-double-pendulum walking robot control
using recurrent hybrid neural network
¸SahinYildirim1
Abstract
This chapter presents neural control scheme of a planar-like double-pendulum-bipedal
robot. For simplicity, only a five-link planar system is considered. The system effec-
tively acts as two dynamically interacting planar robot arms. The scheme employs a
single neural controller for the whole biped. Recurrent networks have feedback con-
nections and thus an inherent memory for dynamics which makes them suitable for
dynamic system modeling. A feature of the networks adopted is their hybrid hidden
layer which includes both linear and nonlinear neurons. The standard proportional
derivative (PD) controller is also employed for comparison. The results presented
show the superior ability of the proposed neural control scheme at adapting to changes
in the dynamics parameters of the bipedal robot.
11.1
Introduction
A bipedal-like double-pendulum robot can be seen as an extension of a twin-arm
Selectively Compliant Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) system if the third dimension
is ignored. The main problem with a bipedal robot, however, is that of balance control
to prevent the robot from falling over and enable it to walk.
Several researchers have proposed dynamic balance control systems for bipedal
robots. A five-degree-of-freedom biped model moving in the sagittal plane has
been investigated [1]. Three criteria have been introduced to evaluate the walk-
‘stability’, ‘maximum speed’, and ‘energy consumption’. In their investigation,
relations between these three criteria and the parameters (gait, speed, period, stride,
length of the leg, joint angles, etc.) are formulated accordingly to dynamics of robot
[2]. A systematic formulation was provided that yields itself to an increase in dimen-
sionality of the model, nonlinear studies and simulation and analysis of single and
double support. The dynamics of a three dimensional model of the human body has
been derived by Huston and Passerello [3]. Their model was subjected to several spe-
cific motions and the ground reaction force and its distance from the center of gravity

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
of the body are calculated. State feedback laws have been suggested [3], since they are
a natural control method for multivariable systems. Control methods using inverted
pendulum type models to generate simple control laws have also been proposed [4].
A method of deriving the linear Quadratic Regulator for an n-legged robot that could
be adapted for bipeds has been presented by Channon et al. [5].
A speed control problem of heavy duty vehicle trough angular position of throttle
valve is researched by Yadav et al. [6]. Modified internal model control with fuzzy
supervisor is used to control the speed of heavy duty vehicle. The time domain per-
formance values were taken into consideration for performance analysis of the heavy
duty vehicle for different uncertains.
An intelligent evolutionary least learning machine tool investigated to forecast
the vehicle speed sequence [7]. Mozaffari et al. were used the driving data collected
on the San Francisco urban roads by a private Honda insight vehicle. As results,
proposed method by Mozaffari et al. was a powerful tool for predicting the vehicle
speeds. Tagne et al. [8] researched to lateral displacement control of autonomous
vehicle with respect to a given reference path. The proposed control law was validated
a driving simulation engine according to several real driving scenarios. Simulations
were also performed using experimental data acquired by a Peugeot 308.
Alam et al. [9] investigated the problem of finding a safety criterion between
neighboring heavy duty vehicle platooning and real-life experimental results were
presented in an attempt to validate the theoretical results in practice. Adaptive intel-
ligent cruise control of heavy duty vehicle was investigated by Alam et al. [10]. In
their study, a linear quadratic control framework used for the controller design. The
proposed controller performance was evaluated through numerical and experimental
studies. The experimental and simulation results showed that heavy duty vehicle pla-
tooning could be conducted at close spacing with standardized sensors and control
units. Rödönyi et al. [11] researched novel numerical methods for analyzing robust
peak-to-peak performance of heterogeneous platoons.The proposed method was indi-
cated on three platoon controllers. A new speed controller for internal combustion
engine designed by Tibola et al. [12]. The proposed controller was used for two
approaches for the internal combustion engine speed control. The stability analysis
for the developed controller was presented.
In this chapter, a neural control approach is used to control hip, foot trajectory
and stability of a bipedal robot. The neural network scheme is employed a single
neural controller for the whole bipedal robot.

Bipedal-like double-pendulum robot
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 illustrate a five-link planar bipedal robot. As can be seen from
the figures, the torso has mass mt and inertia Jt measured about its center of mass
which is located at distance lt above the hip joints.
The upper and lower leg elements are identical, with length 2le, mass me and
inertia Je measured about their centers of mass. The feet have mass mf located at
the ankle joint and are assumed to have negligible inertia. With both feet on the
ground, the robot acts almost like the closed-loop linkage of two cooperating planar

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
SCARA robots. However, the goal of this chapter is to propose a control law for the
walking is the control of the walking movements of the robot where only one foot
remains on the ground.
11.2.1 Walking
Walking commences at time t = 0 with one foot, called the swing foot, leaving the
ground as depicted in Figure 11.3(a). Then, over a period T, the swing foot moves
forward a distance 2L and the hip a distance L. Walking ends at time t = T −, the instant
just prior to the swing foot making contact with the ground. Throughout this period,
the other foot, called the stance foot, remains fixed on the ground, thus providing a
single support for the biped.
Atagiveninstantduringthesingle-supportphase, thepositionofthebipedalrobot
relative to the stance foot can be specified by the following coordinate vector :
 = [ψ
α1
α2
β1
β2]T
(11.1)
where ψ represents the angle of the torso with respect to the vertical, α1 and α2 are the
angles of the upper leg elements relative to the vertical and β1 and β2 are the angles
of the lower leg elements relative to the vertical, as shown in Figure 11.1.
Motors located at the robot’s hip, knees and stance foot generate torques τ1 to τ5
as shown in Figure 11.2. These can be grouped into vector τ where
τ = [τ1
τ2
τ3
τ4
τ5]
(11.2)
Note that the torque arising from the swing foot ankle joint motor must be zero due
to the assumption of negligible foot inertia. Hence, it is not included in (11.2).
The joint accelerations ¨ arising from the application of torques τ can be derived
from the following [13]:
M() ¨ + V(, ˙) + G() = C1F1 + C2F2 + Dτ
(11.3)
where M() is the mass matrix, V(, ˙) is a vector containing centripetal and
Coriolis terms, G() is a vector of torques arising from gravitational loading, F1 and
F2 are the foot forces, C1 and C2 are the foot force transformation matrices and D
is the joint transformation matrix. General equation of biped motion is described in
Appendix.
11.2.2
Impact
The second stage of a step results in the swing foot hitting the ground and the stance
foot breaking contact with the ground. This stage, termed impact, is assumed to be
instantaneous, commencing at time t = T −and finishing at some infinitesimally short
time later t = T + (Figure 11.3(b)). Consequently, the position of the biped will not
appreciably change during impact.

Proposed neural network
Neural network can be represented in a general diagrammatic form as illustrated in
Figure 11.4. This diagram depicts the hybrid hidden layer as comprising a linear part
and a nonlinear part and shows that, in addition to the usual feedforward connections,
the networks also have feedback connections from the output layer to the hidden layer
and self-feedback connections in the hidden layer [14].

Neural network controller
At a given discrete time t, let (t) be the input to a recurrent hybrid network,
τ(t) the output of the network, x1(t) the output of the linear part of the hidden layer
and x2(t) the output of the nonlinear part of the hidden layer.
The operation of the proposed network is summarized by the following equations:
x1(t + 1) = WI1(t + 1) + βx1(t) + αJ1τ(t)
(11.4)
x2(t + 1) = F{WI2(t + 1) + βx2(t) + αJ2τ(t)}
(11.5)
τ(t + 1) = WH1x1(t + 1) + WH2x2(t + 1)
(11.6)
where WI1 is the matrix of weights of connections between the input layer and the
linear hidden layer,WI2 is the matrix of weights of connections between the input layer
and the nonlinear hidden layer, WH1 is the matrix of weights of connections between
thelinearhiddenlayerandtheoutputlayer,WH2 isthematrixofweightsofconnections
between the nonlinear hidden layer and the output layer, F{} is the activation function
of neurons in the nonlinear hidden layer and α and β are the weights of the self-
feedback and output feedback connections. J1 and J2 are respectively nH1 × nO and
nH2 × nO matrices with all elements equal to 1, where nH1 and nH2 are the numbers
of linear and nonlinear hidden neurons and nO is the number of output neurons.

Bipedal-double-pendulum walking robot control
269
If only linear activation is adopted for the hidden neurons, the above equations
simplify to:
τ(t + 1) = WH1x(t + 1)
(11.7)
x(t + 1) = WI1(t + 1) + βx(t) + αJ1τ(t)
(11.8)
Replacing τ(t + 1) by WH1 x(t + 1) in (11.8) gives
x(t + 1) = (βI + αJ1WH1)x(t) + WI1(t + 1)
(11.9)
where I is a nH1 × nH1 identity matrix.
Equation (11.9) is of the form
x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + B(t + 1)
(11.10)
where A = βI + αJWH1 and B =WI1. Equation (11.10) represents the state equation
of a linear system of which x is the state vector. The elements of A and B can
be adjusted through training so that any arbitrary linear system of order nH1 can be
modeled by the given network. When nonlinear neurons are adopted, this gives the
network the ability to perform nonlinear dynamics mapping and thus model nonlinear
dynamic systems. The existence in the recurrent hybrid network of a hidden layer
with both linear and nonlinear neurons facilitates the modeling of practical nonlinear
systems comprising linear and nonlinear parts. The inverse dynamics equation of the
robot includes both linear terms and nonlinear terms. Thus, in theory, the inverse
dynamics model of the robot and therefore an inverse model controller for it can be
implemented using the proposed recurrent hybrid neural network structure.
In this work, the values of the weights of the recurrent connections, α and β,
were fixed. This means only the weights of the feedforward connections, WI and WH,
needed to be adjusted and thus, it was possible to employ the standard backpropagation
algorithm to train the neural network.
11.4
Control system
Figure 11.5 shows the control system adopted [14]. The system comprises a PD
controller and a Neural Network (NN) controller, which is a recurrent hybrid network
used to model the inverse dynamics of the biped. A trajectory generator (not shown)
produces the required sequence of rotations for each joint to yield the desired walking
movements of the biped. The NN is trained online during control to give the system
the ability to adapt to change. Relative positions  of the robot joint angles are used
as reference signals to the controller:

From Figure 11.5, the vector of input torques to the bipedal robot is given by

(11.13)
where
τ N = f (, e)
(11.14)
τ P = KPe + KD˙e
(11.15)
τ N is the output of the NN controller (Figure 11.4), which is seen as performing a
nonlinear mapping f on the set point  and the control error e. τ P is the output of the
PD controller. KP and KD are the gains of the controller. In this work, the following
empirically determined values were adopted for KP and KD: KP = diag [4000 4000
4000 4000 4000] and KD = diag [20 20 20 20 20].
11.4.1
Neural network controller
The NN controllers for biped control system 1 had three layers, as shown in
Figure 11.4. The first layer received reference inputs from the trajectory genera-
tor and also the control errors. Again, the second layer consisted of two parts, a linear
part and a nonlinear part. Finally, the third layer of the network produced outputs to
drive the robot joints.
The controller was trained by backpropagating the error e through the biped in a
way similar to that shown in Figure 11.5, with a minor modification as shown below.

Conclusion
This paper has described the neural control systems for a whole bipedal robot. The
main contribution of the paper consists in the solution of biped stability by means of
neural network controllers. The system controls all of the robot joints simultaneously.
Simulations have shown that proposed controllers are better than simple standard
PD controllers at rejecting large load disturbances and accommodating different step
lengths and walking stances.

Abstract
This chapter gives a general scope, states the main results obtained and methods used
for the polytopic Takagi–Sugeno approach with a detailed application to the inverted
pendulum. Modeling, observer and controller design will be considered.
12.1
Introduction
The modeling of complex dynamic systems such as in biochemical processes or
mobile robotic applications often results in nonlinear models. In order to enhance
their performance, this nonlinear behavior has to be taken into account in the control
and/or observer design. The complexity of the resulting models to be dealt with then
also requires the use of heavy mathematical tools.
In order to cope with the complexity introduced by various kind of nonlineari-
ties (nonlinear behavior, time-varying parameters, saturation, hysteresis, sin and cos
functions, …) and since a considerable amount of results have been established in
the linear systems framework, the idea behind the so-called Takagi–Sugeno (T–S)
polytopic model is to extend these existing results for nonlinear models.
However, the direct transition from linear models to the nonlinear one remains
delicate. Hence, new modeling techniques have been proposed in order to make “eas-
ier” and “elegant” this transition [1]. In fact, the polytopic T–S or multiple models
(MMs) decomposition provides an alternative and attractive path to deal with com-
plex nonlinear systems and to obtain an equivalent representation by bounding the
parameters and using the well-known sector-nonlinearity transformation (SNT). This

structure offers an efficient representation of nonlinear behaviors while remaining
relatively simple compared to general nonlinear models.
The strength of these techniques consists in the fact that the properties of the non-
linear systems are expressed by a collection of linear subsystems, i.e., in a polytopic
paradigm, where the overall model of the system is obtained by merging the local
subsystems through a time-varying blending called weighting functions. Thanks to
the convexity of the weighting functions and to the linearity of the subsystems defin-
ing the vertices, some results can be established for nonlinear systems [2–5] using
tools borrowed from the linear theory [6,7].
As pointed in [1,8], different MMs can be obtained using different aggregation
structures of the submodels. Basically, two major structures can be distinguished.
As explained in the following table and illustrated by Figures 12.1 and 12.2, in the
first structure, the submodels share the same state vector (the so-called polytopic T–S
model); in the second one, known as decoupled MM, the submodels are decoupled,
and their state vectors are different.

In the following, only the coupled class will be addressed since its model may be
obtained in a systematic way from the analytic expression of the nonlinear model with-
out any loss of information by the SNT (presented in the next section). The decoupled
representation is more interesting for the identification where the different dimension
of the submodels may avoid an extra parametrization in certain working set [9]. How-
ever, since the work presented in this chapter does not concern the identification and
for the estimation and control, the decoupled model may be easily transposed into a
coupled one (by concatenating the local states xi), the presented study will be only
about the coupled polytopic T–S models.
In the present chapter, a survey about the T–S polytopic approach and its applica-
tion to an inverted pendulum is presented; two main problems will be addressed: the
first one is the modeling and the second one is the control design (observer based).
The modeling process through the well-known SNT is introduced. This proce-
dure is used as a systematic and analytical method to rewrite and thus transform a
nonlinear system into a polytopic T–S form without any loss of information [10,11].
The observer design is then presented with a Lyapunov stability analysis used to
derive sufficient existence conditions of the observer. These conditions are expressed
in terms of LMI s, which can easily be solved by dedicated softwares (LMI tool-
box in MATLAB®, YALMIP [12] or the SeDuMi package for solving optimization
problems with linear, quadratic and semidefiniteness constraints [13].
The inverted pendulum example is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach. From the nonlinear equations of the inverted pendulum, using
the SNT transformation, a T–S polytopic model of the system is deduced and used.
The overview of this chapter is as follows. A short introduction to T–S systems
and SNT transformation is presented in Section 12.2, and some useful results on the
observer and controller design are detailed in Sections 12.3 and 12.4. A numerical
example of an inverted pendulum to illustrate each step is given for all sections.
12.2
Systematic transformation of a nonlinear system
into a polytopic T–S form
An efficient way to deal with nonlinear system estimation or fault diagnosis con-
sists in rewriting the original nonlinear system in a simpler form, like the polytopic
T–S model. Originally introduced by [14], the T–S representation allows to exactly

286
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
describe nonlinear systems, under the condition that the nonlinearities are bounded.
This is reasonable since state variables as well as parameters of physical systems are
bounded ([10,15] and the references therein). The polytopic T–S model is based on
a nonlinear interpolation between certain linear submodels with adequate weighting
functions.
The T–S systems, as proposed by Takagi and Sugeno [14], are described by local
models merged together using fuzzy IF-THEN rules, as follows:
IF z1(t) is in Mi1 and …and zp(t) is in Mip,
THEN

˙x(t) = Aix(t) + Biu(t)
y(t) = Cix(t)
i = 1, 2, . . . , r
(12.1)
where Mij is the fuzzy set, and r is the number of model rules; x(t) ∈Rnx is the system
state, u(t) ∈Rm is the input and y(t) ∈Rp is the system output. zi(t) are known premise
variables and each linear consequent equation represented by Aix(t) + Biu(t) is called
subsystem.
Note that for the “fuzzy” model, the fuzzification process consists in transform-
ing crisp values into fuzzy linguistic variables. The membership function is used to
associate a grade to each linguistic variable. Selection of the number of membership
functions and their initial values is based on the process knowledge and intuition.
In order to obtain a polytopic T–S representation from a nonlinear system, in
a systematic and more structured way, the SNT is applied. The SNT is a system-
atic procedure that guarantees an exact model construction for nonlinear systems
with bounded nonlinearities. Starting with a general form of nonlinear systems, a
quasi-linear parameter-varying (LPV) state representation is realized. The polytopic
T–S form is then obtained by using the convex polytopic transformation where each
vertex defines a linear submodel, and nonlinear parts are rejected into the weighting
functions μi(ξ(t)).
On the opposite of a classical fuzzy model, the weighting functions premise
variables of the polytopic T–S form may be either measurable or unmeasurable. For
simplicity reasons, it is easier to consider a system with measurable premise variables
(most of the available works in the literature have considered models with measur-
able premise variables). However, in most practical cases (and realistic models), the
premise variables depend on the state variables of the plant (and even sometimes
unknown input dependent), which brings some additional difficulties but leads to
more challenging problems in the observer/controller design. In this chapter, both
cases of measurable and unmeasurable premise variables are considered.
Consider a dynamic nonlinear system described by the following state equations:

˙x(t) = f (t, x, u)
y(t) = g(t, x, u)
(12.2)
where f (.) and g(.) are vector functions of dimension Rnx and Rp, respectively.

(12.4)
In order to obtain the polytopic T–S form, first, the system (12.2) is transformed in a
linear time-varying form:

˙x(t) = A(ξ(t))x(t) + B(ξ(t))u(t)
y(t) = C(ξ(t))x(t) + D(ξ(t))u(t)
(12.5)
Note that several choices for the system (12.5) are possible (details on how to
obtain (12.5) from (12.2) are detailed in [10]). The nonlinear entries of the matrices
X (ξ(t)), with X ∈{A, B, C, D}, are called premise variables and denoted as ξj(x, u),
j = 1, . . . , q.
From (12.5), a convex polytopic transformation is performed for each premise
variable as follows:
ξj(x, u) = Fj,1(ξj(x, u))ξj,1 + Fj,2(ξj(x, u))ξj,2
(12.6)
where
ξj,1 = max
x,u {ξj(x, u)},
ξj,2 = min
x,u {ξj(x, u)}

ξj,1 −ξj,2
Fj,2(ξj(x, u)) = ξj,1 −ξj(x, u)
ξj,1 −ξj,2
(12.8)
For q premise variables, n = 2q submodels are obtained. The weighting functions
μi(t) are defined by
μi(t) =

n
j=1Fj,σ j
i (ξj(x, u))
(12.9)
where the indexes σ j
i (i = 1, . . . , 2q and j = 1, . . . , q) are equal to 1 or 2 and indicate
which partition of the jth premise variable (Fj,1 or Fj,2) is involved in the ith submodel.

288

The relation between the submodel number i and indexes σ j
i is given by
i = 2n−1σ 1
i + 2n−2σ 2
i + · · · + 20σ n
i −(21 + 22 + · · · + 2n−1)
(12.10)
The constant matrices Xi are obtained by replacing the variables ξj in the matrices
A, B, C and D with the scalars defined in (12.7):
Xi = X (ξ1,σ 1
i , . . . , ξq,σ q
i ),
X ∈{A, B, C, D}
(12.11)
To sum up, the SNT decomposition enables to represent the nonlinear system (12.2)
in a compact polytopic T–S model (12.3) without any approximation or loss of infor-
mation. For a better understanding of the previous procedure, let us consider the

Stability analysis of polytopic T–S systems
Let us consider the following time-varying system:
˙x(t) = A(t)x(t)
(12.29)

A survey on the polytopic Takagi–Sugeno approach
291
this system is asymptotically stable (quadratic stability), if there exists a Lyapunov
matrix P positive symmetric P = PT > 0 such that the Lyapunov function
V(x(t)) = xT(t)Px(t) > 0
(12.30)
is positive, null for x = 0 and decreasing in time. The same reasoning is applied for
the nonlinear system represented by the autonomous T–S model:
˙x(t) =
n

i=1
μi(ξ(t))Aix(t)
(12.31)
with the weighting functions μi(ξ(t)) satisfying the convex sum property (12.4).
Lemma 12.1. The system (12.31) is globally asymptotically stable if there exists a
matrix P positive symmetric P = PT > 0 ∈Rnx×nx such that the following conditions
are verified for i = 1, . . . , n [10]:
AT
i P + PAi < 0
(12.32)
Proof. The proof is based on the choice of a Lyapunov function V(x(t)) = xT(t)Px(t)
where P = PT > 0 ∈Rnx×nx. The sum convex property of the weighting functions
allows to obtain n matrices inequalities (LMI s) to solve simultaneously.
Later research has focused in conceiving more efficient LMI s conditions,
such as the ones in [16–18]. In fact, a key point for the T–S system study is the
search for an adequate Lyapunov function. A usual approach is to call for a single
quadratic Lyapunov function but a significant improvement can be obtained by con-
sidering time-varying or polytopic Lyapunov functions that incorporate the system
dynamics [19–21].
12.4
Observer design for polytopic T–S models
The observability concept for a system consists on establishing the conditions under
which the state may be reconstructed from the inputs and the measurable outputs.
For the nonlinear systems, the observability problem has been widely studied in
the literature (see [22–24] for example).
For the T–S approach, a necessary condition for the observability may be given
by the observability constraint of the local systems, i.e., for each pair (Ai, Ci) of the
system submodels, or at least their detectability [25,26].
Let us consider the following polytopic T–S model given by the following
equation:
⎧
⎪⎨

˙x(t) =


i=1
μi(ξ(t))(Aix(t) + Biu(t))
y(t) = Cx(t)
(12.33)

292
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
The most common observer for these systems is a polytopic Luenberger observer [27].
It basically consists in extending the design of the popular Luenberger (proportional)
observer used in the linear system framework. It is defined by
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
˙ˆx(t) =
n

i=1
μi(ˆξ(t))(Aiˆx(t) + Biu(t) + Li(y(t) −ˆy(t)))
ˆy(t) = Cˆx(t)
(12.34)
with ˆx(t) and ˆξ(t) represent, respectively, the state x(t) and premise variables ξ(t)
estimate.
The observer gains Li are designed such that the state estimate ˆx(t) asymptotically
converges toward the state x(t). Then, the error dynamics stability e(t) = x(t) −ˆx(t)
has to be ensured.
The weighting functions μi(ξ(t)) verify the following convex sum property:
r

i=1
μi(ξ(t)) = 1,
0 ≤μi(ξ(t)) ≤1,
i = 1, . . . , M,
∀t
(12.35)
ξ(t) may depend on measurable premises variables (a part of the input u(t) or the
output y(t)) or unmeasurable premises variables (as the system states, UIs). The state
estimation for nonlinear systems using the T–S polytopic model approach has been
addressed with different methods, but most of the available works in the literature
have considered models with measurable premise variables.
For simplicity reasons, it is easier to consider a system with measurable premise
variables. However, in most practical cases (and realistic models), the premise vari-
ables depend on the state variables of the plant (and even sometimes unknown input
dependent). In this chapter, both cases of measurable premise variables and the gen-
eral case of unmeasurable premise variables are addressed; the second case brings
some additional difficulties but leads to more challenging problems in the observer
design [28,29].
12.4.1
Measurable premise variables
In the measurable premise variables case, the observer design is based on the avail-
ability of the premise variables. Then, the system and the polytopic observer share
the same weighting (also called activation) functions. The main advantage is the pos-
sibility to factorize these functions during the estimation error dynamic study e(t)
defined as x(t)−ˆx(t). We then have
˙e(t) =
n

i=1
μi(ξ(t))(Ai −LiC)e(t)
(12.36)
A simple stability analysis of the system (12.36) allows us to find the desired gains
Li and that may be given for example by the following theorem:

Lemma 12.2. [30]The state estimation error converges asymptotically to zero if there
exists a positive symmetric matrix P = PT > 0 ∈Rnx×nx and matrices Ki ∈Rnx×m

The observer gains are then given by

sum may be reduced (see [16,31] for more details).
12.4.2
Unmeasurable premise variables
For the unmeasurable premise variables case, the estimation error dynamics cannot
be easily computed directly, since in the considered case, the weighting functions
depend on the unmeasurable variables ξ(t), whereas those of the observer depend on
their estimates ˆξ(t). In order to overcome this difficulty, taking benefits of the convex
sum property, the state derivative is rewritten as an uncertain T–S system where the
uncertainties are bounded. The observer gains are then determined in a way to ensure
the stability of the state estimation error dynamics as well as an L2 attenuation of the
transfer from the uncertainties to the state estimation error.
The polytopic T–S model (12.33) is then rewritten as
˙x(t) =

Polytopic T–S models stabilization
The most common strategy for the nonlinear polytopic T–S models stabilization is
the so-called parallel distributed compensation (PDC). Introduced in [33,34], this
command law depends on the same weighting functions used for the polytopic T–S
model. These controllers may be state feedback, observer based or output feedback
(static or dynamic).
In this section, the controller design for both state and output feedback is pre-
sented. Pros and cons for each method will be given and illustrated with an application
to the inverted pendulum system (if applicable).

asymptotic stability is ensured if there exists a positive symmetric matrix P1 ∈

The control objective of this subsection is to balance the inverted pendulum around
the origin (x3 ≃0). To illustrate this application, a PDC control is applied. In order to
minimize the design effort and complexity, we will use as few rules as possible. So, we
consider our model around small angle, which implies the following simplification:
cos(x3) ≃1,
sin(x3) ≃x3
(12.51)
The premise variables are then resumed to
ξ1(t) =

M + mx2
3(t),
ξ4(t) = x4(t).x3(t)
(12.52)
The corresponding polytopic T–S model will be then represented by four submodels.
The rank of the controllability matrix is checked.

We can note that the state feedback controller is based on the fact that all the states
are available. If it is not the case, either the observer-based state feedback stabilization
or the output feedback stabilization can be used.

Observer-based state feedback stabilization
For the case where the system state is not fully available, a solution may be an observer-
based controller. As it was done for the observer design, both cases of measurable
and unmeasurable premise variables are presented.

Let us consider the Lyapunov function V(xa(t)) = xT
a (t)Pxa(t). The augmented
system asymptotic stability (12.70) is ensured if the following conditions are satisfied
for i, j, k = 1, . . . , n [34,35]:

i, j < k s.t. μi ∩μj ∩μk = ∅
(12.71)
The notation μi ∩μj ∩μk = ∅means that for all i, j < k excepting μiμjμk = 0, ∀ξ.
Conditions (12.71) are not convex (due to μi(ξ) ̸= μi(ˆξ)), it is difficult to trans-
form them into LMI s in P, Ki and Li. To solve those issues, the following technique
was proposed in [35]:
Let us consider the following bloc diagonal Lyapunov function:

following:
Since the BMI (12.73) imply that
RT
ijP1 + P1Rij

(Rik + Rij)TP1 + P1(Rik + Rij) < 0
(12.74)
These last inequalities are easy to transform into LMI . Once P1 and Ki are obtained,
we substitute them into (12.73) and obtain LMI conditions in P2 and Li that can be
solved by a convex optimization technique such as the interior point method.
In order to illustrate the observer-based feedback controller, let us consider the
previous example with four submodels.

Observer-based state feedback controller
To simplify the computation (less LMI s to solve), the controller gains were set to
be equal, they are given by
K =
−0.2146 −0.8185 −16.8005 −3.3704
(12.76)
The nonlinear system is simulated with the polytopic T–S controller, the obtained
results are depicted in Figure 12.4.
From the depicted figure, it is shown that the efficiency of the proposed observer-
based feedback controller. Note that the control law u(t) is in a polytopic T–S form,
and it was applied to the nonlinear model.
Remark 12.1. Another way would be to use the descriptor approach [36,37]. In
fact, this approach is well known to avoid the coupling terms between the feedback
gains and the Lyapunov matrices and thus facilitates the LMI s resolution. As a
consequence, the number of LMI s to solve decreases, and relaxed conditions are
obtained [37].
The design procedure is then summarized in the following steps:
●
Deduce the augmented state dynamics xa(t) =

and (12.42).
●
For positive symmetric matrices P1 and P2 and a matrix P3, the condition to
satisfy for the asymptotic stability of the augmented system (12.77) is given by
⎛
⎝

where ∗refers to the transpose term and S(M) := M + M T.

Using the definition of A(t) and B(t) (as it was done in Section 12.4.2), and
the following lemma:
Lemma 12.3. [38] Let us consider matrices X and Y of appropriate dimensions,
a time-varying matrix (t) and a positive scalar ε.The following property is true:
X TT(t)Y + Y T(t)X ≤εX TX + ε−1Y TY
(12.83)
if T(t)(t) ≤I.
The inequality (12.79) is linearized, and the observer and controller gains
deduced (by a simple change of variables).
Another interesting study case would be the uncertain polytopic T–S systems. In
fact, if the model presents some uncertainties or modeling error, they have to be taken
into account in the design process. A short overview of this case is given in the next
subsection.

12.5.2.3
State feedback stabilization for uncertain polytopic
T–S systems
In practice, there exists several uncertainties sources that affect the physical systems;
these uncertainties must be taken into account during the modeling.
They may be due to an imperfect knowledge of the system parameters numerical
values, to some modeling approximation, unknown inputs or disturbances. All these
phenomena introduce a difference between the real system behavior and the one
obtained by its model simulation.
In order to avoid this difference, or at least to minimize their effect, several robust
control techniques have been proposed [39–41]. In the following, the state feedback
stabilization for uncertain polytopic T–S systems is presented.
Let us consider the following model:
˙x(t) =
n

i=1
μi(ξ(t))((Ai + A(t))x(t) + (Bi + B(t))u(t))
(12.84)
where the uncertainties A(t), B(t) that affect the state and control matrices are
common to all submodels and are given in the form
A(t) = AA(t)EA
(12.85)
B(t) = BB(t)EB
(12.86)
The time-varying matrices A(t) and B(t) are unknown but bounded as follows:
T
A(t)A(t) ≤I, ∀t
(12.87)
T
B(t)B(t) ≤I, ∀t
(12.88)
Let us consider the following control law for the system (12.84) where the premise
variables are supposed to be measurable:
u(t) = −
n

j=1
μj(ξ(t))Kjx(t)
(12.89)
where the controller gains Kj ∈Rnu×nx are to be determined.
Replacing (12.89) into (12.84), we obtain
˙x(t) =
n

i=1
n

j=1
μi(ξ(t))μj(ξ(t))(Ai −BiKj + A(t) −B(t)Kj)x(t)
(12.90)
In order to analyze the system state stability, let us consider the following Lyapunov
function:
V(x(t)) = xT(t)Px(t)
(12.91)
where P ∈Rn is a positive symmetric matrix.

In order to ensure (12.90) global asymptotic stability, the following conditions
must be verified:

⎝

⎠< 0,
i, j = 1, . . . , n
(12.92)
with P1 = P−1, λA, λB are positive scalars and S(AiP1 −BiRj) := AiP1 −BiRj +
P1AT
i −RT
j BT
i . In this case, the controller gains Kj are given by
Kj = RjP−1
1
(12.93)
for i, j = 1, . . . , n.
The presented results are given for the measurable premise variable. They may
be extended to the general case of unmeasurable premise variable as well as to the
observer-based control by applying the same idea and based on the results presented
in the previous subsection.
As it was shown, the state feedback or observer-based feedback approach is quite
interesting for the system stabilization. In other alternative, we have to achieve a
stability purpose in the case where the system state is not fully available and/or to
avoid the additional computations due to an observer design would be the output
feedback control.
12.5.3
Static output feedback stabilization
In this section, the static output feedback control is considered. Contrarily to the
observer-based or output dynamic controllers [42–44], static controllers are particu-
larly interesting to reduce real-time computational cost when implementing practical
applications since it does not need any ODE solving [2,45]. However, it is important
to highlight that the drawback of output feedback controllers is the coupling intro-
duced that makes the LMI s to be solved quite conservative and restrictive for some
cases [46].
In the following section, the descriptor approach applied to the polytopic T–S
models is also introduced. The descriptor approach consists on introducing virtual
dynamics in the outputs equations, then, a descriptor formulation can be obtained
considering an extended state vector for the closed-loop dynamics. Rewriting the
closed-loop system by the use of descriptor form allows to avoid appearance of cross-
ing terms between the state-space matrices and the controller’s ones. Therefore, the
benefit of the descriptor formulation is to make easier the LMI s formulation of
nonquadratic stability conditions [36,37,47,48]. Herein, the stabilization condition for
polytopicT–S models with static output feedback is based on the descriptor approach.
For simplicity reasons, only the case of measurable premise variables is considered.
Let us consider the following polytopic T–S model:

A possible choice of the matrix P ensuring the condition (12.100) is a block diagonal
form P = diag(P1, P2, P3) with P1 = PT
1 > 0 and P2, P3 > 0. In this case, V(t) is a
quadratic function of the state system, in fact, V(t) = xT(t)P1x(t). The time derivative
of the Lyapunov function (12.99) is then given by

A survey on the polytopic Takagi–Sugeno approach
305
From the presented results, it is important to highlight that the polytopicT–S approach
may be really efficient (when it is applicable). In fact, this approach does not fit to all
systems, in many cases, we will have some structural constraints that make it simply
impossible to be applied like for the proposed static output feedback controller and
the inverted pendulum.
It is clear thattheproposedcontroller(12.95)existsonlyifthe(12.102)conditions
are satisfied, which is not the case for the considered application. In fact, the LMI s
(12.102) admit a solution only if each local system (or subsystem) is stable, i.e.,
real part of the eigenvalues of Ai is negative, which is not the case for the inverted
pendulum.
A solution in this case would be to search for a relaxed conditions by introducing a
polytopic Lyapunov function or a dynamic state feedback controller for example, such
that introducing extra dynamics may be required to increase the number of degrees
of freedom in the design and improve the closed-loop transient response.
Some more results regarding the structural constraints for polytopic T–S models
may be found in the following articles [49–51].
12.6
Conclusion
In this chapter, a review on the polytopic T–S approach with an application to the
inverted pendulum was presented.A general scope of the approach with the most com-
mon results was presented and applied to a nonlinear model of the inverted pendulum.
It was shown in one hand that the polytopicT–S approach may be an effective tool with
several advantages and satisfying results; however, in the other hand, that approach is
subject to some structural constraints that do not make it applicable for any system.

Robust fault-tolerant control of nonlinear
inverted pendulum and cart system with
simultaneous actuator and sensor faults
sliding-mode observer
Slim Dhahri1, Ali Ben Brahim1, Fayçal Ben Hmida1
and Anis Sellami1
In this chapter, we propose a robust active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) scheme for
a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with simultaneous actuator and sensor faults
described viaTakagi–Sugeno (T–S) multiple models. First, by transforming the sensor
fault into pseudoactuator fault, a novel T–S sliding-mode observer (TS-SMO) with
two discontinuous terms is developed to provide separate estimates of the actuator and
sensor faults for the purpose of fault compensation. The robustness of the proposed
observer against uncertainties has been taken into account via H∞norm minimiza-
tion. Second, we use obtained on-line fault estimation information to design dynamic
output feedback controller (DOFC) for robustly compensating the effects of actuator
and sensor faults from the system inputs and outputs and guarantee the stability of the
overall closed-loop system. The stability proof with H∞performances and D-stability
constraints is formulated as a linear matrix inequalities (LMI) optimization problem.
The effectiveness of the proposed robust AFTC approach to treat simultaneous actu-
ator and sensor faults is illustrated using a nonlinear inverted pendulum with cart
system.

Introduction
Fault disturbs the normal system operations, thus causing an unacceptable deteriora-
tion of these performances or leading to wrong dangerous situations. This fault can
occur in any part of the system such as actuators and sensors. Sensor fault degrades the
feedback system performances and so touches the control stability. Similarly, actuator
fault may lead to minimize the performances of design controllers, or even the overall

system execution. In order to preserve system performances and human security, fault
diagnosis (FD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) technology have caused wide atten-
tion over the past few years. A very powerful approach for FD is fault estimation (FE)
in the sense that it not only detects and isolates the fault, but determines the size,
location and dynamics behavior of the fault along a system trajectories. Therefore,
FE is considered a major problem in the modern control theory that received a con-
siderable amount of attention during the past few years. Fruitful results can be found
in several excellent books [1–3] and survey papers [4–6].
In practical applications, most of the systems are nonlinear, so it is significant to
study FD and FTC of nonlinear systems. For the case of Lipschitz nonlinear systems,
LMI-based FTC designs to compensate actuator fault are proposed in [7–9]. The
authors in [10,11] addresses the FTC design for Lipschitz nonlinear systems subject
to matched uncertainty along with sensor faults using a sliding-mode observer (SMO).
Since its excellent ability of nonlinear system description, very interesting approaches
have represented these systems under Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy form. T–S models
have been introduced in [12]. The feature is to understand the overall system behavior
by a set of local linear models. Each local model represents the system’s operation
in a particular area. The local models are then aggregated using an interpolation
mechanism by premise variables satisfying the convex sum property. Taking the T–S
representation, several attempts have been oriented to the FE and FTC of nonlinear
systems, see for instance [13–20].
Thanks to its robustness to uncertainties, special attentions have already been
made in the application of SMO design to robust FE and FTC schemes for T–S
systems subject to actuator and/or sensor faults [21–27]. In the context of actuator
FE, constructing diagnosis model in order to estimate faults is not possible if sensor
faults occur simultaneously. The same difficulty is present when trying to estimate
sensor faults. Several design methods have been developed in a precise and effective
way when actuator and sensor faults estimation is divided on two steps:
Step 1: Actuator FE is proven without considering sensor faults [28–40].
Step 2: Sensor FE is solved without considering actuator faults [41–48].
Nevertheless, in practical systems, it is often the case when actuator and sensor
faults occur simultaneously. In this framework, simultaneous FE is highly important.
So far, in [49,50], the authors propose simultaneously estimating actuator and sensor
faults study for Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Two subsystems are constructed where
each one contains a particular class of faults. In [51,52], the problem of simultaneous
actuator and sensor FE is considered for linear parameter varying systems. The idea
of this work is based on the transformation of sensor fault in order to obtain an
augmented actuator fault vector.
The information issued from actuator and sensor FE scheme are used by the FTC
module to reconfigure the control law in order to compensate the faults and ensure
acceptable system performances. FTC for various forms of T–S model has received
considerably increasing attention both in modern research theory and application
domains even in faulty situations. Wonderful results can be obtained by [18,53–57].

Robust fault-tolerant control of nonlinear inverted pendulum
311
These studies guarantee the stability of systems with various faults. In addition, the
problem of fault-tolerant tracking control is discussed in [58].
Based on the above works, the objective of this chapter is to develop robustAFTC
based on FE of simultaneous actuator and sensor faults for T–S fuzzy systems. The
main contributions of this chapter are two aspects:
●
First, robust TS-SMO with two discontinuous terms is designed for simultaneous
actuatorandsensorFE.Thestabilityconditionsoftheproposedobserverisstudied
with Lyapunov theories and LMI convex optimization.
●
Second, using the obtained FE, a dynamic output feedback controller (DOFC)-
based FTC is designed to guarantee the system stability in the presence of actuator
and sensor faults.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: In Section 13.2, we introduce
nonlinear and T–S model structures of an inverted pendulum from the literature [59].
In Section 13.3, we describe the LMI-based design of the proposed robust T–S fuzzy
SMO for both the actuator and sensor fault cases. Section 13.4 presents the design
of T–S DOFC scheme to compensate the effect of simultaneous actuator and sensor
faults. Simulation example is given in Section 13.5 illustrating the effectiveness of
the proposed methods. Finally, Section 13.6 presents some concluding remarks.
13.2
Problem formulation
13.2.1
Motivation
Simultaneous actuator and sensor faults represent a common challenge for AFTC
methods.This motivates the proposal of a strategy to ensure system robustness against
this challenging and practically probable scenario of simultaneous faults via an esti-
mation and compensation approach. Hence, the objective of this chapter is to develop
an AFTC strategy for regulator problems based on robust FE and compensation of
simultaneous actuator faults and sensor faults. The compensation process requires
two steps. The first is to design a robust TS-SMO with two discontinuous terms able
to provide separate estimates of the actuator and/or sensor faults despite the pres-
ence of uncertainties. Second, based on the faults estimation, a T–S DOFC is used in
order to maintain the performance and stability of the nominal control system during
both faulty and fault-free cases. The schematic diagram of this approach is shown in
Figure 13.1.

Mathematical model
The inverted-pendulum benchmark, in particular, the cart version illustrated in
Figure 13.2, has been considered in many references to solve the problem of nonlinear
control [59]. The cart with inverted pendulum consists of a moveable carriage with
one degree of freedom on which a pendulum is mounted and freely rotatable in driving

C ∈Rp×n and N ∈Rp×h are the matrices describing the so-called ith submodel. It
is supposed that rank(C) = p, rank(N) = h where n > p ≥˜q (˜q = q + h), the pairs
(Ai, Bi) are controllable, and the pairs (Ai, Ci) are observable. fa(t) ∈Rq represents
the vector of actuator faults, and fs(t) ∈Rh represents the vector of sensor faults.
The integer k represents the number of submodels. The weighing functions μi are
nonlinear and depend on the premise variable ζ(t) is supposed to be measurable.
Remark 13.1. The T–S model (13.9) of inverted pendulum with cart is a special case
of (13.10), while assuming that the uncertainties and actuator fault affect the system
in the same direction as the control input; therefore, Di = Bi and Mi = Bi.
Remark 13.2. The common C and N in (13.10) are only a small restriction, since
many applications [17,19,20] comprise outputs that are linear in the system states
and sensor faults.

for any ζ(t). Before starting the main results of this chapter, the following assumptions
are made:
Assumption 13.1. The actuator fault distribution matrix Mi in (13.10) satisfies:
rank(CMi) = rank(Mi) = q
(13.12)
Assumption 13.2. All invariant zeros of (Ai, Mi, C) must lie in the open left half of
the complex plane, that is
rank
 sIn −Ai Mi
C

= n + q
(13.13)
holds for all complex number s with Re(s) ≥0.
Assumption 13.3. The actuator fault fa(t) and sensor fault fs(t), and the uncertainty
vector ξ(t) satisfy the following norm bounded constraints:
∥fa(t)∥≤ρa, ∥fs(t)∥≤ρs, ∥ξ(t)∥≤ξ0
(13.14)
where ρa, ρs and ξ0 are three known positive constants.
In order to transform the sensor faults into a fictitious actuator faults, we assume that
there exists an orthogonal matrix TR ∈Rp×p, obtained by the QR transformation of
sensor faults matrix N, such that
TRy(t) :=
 y1(t) = C1x(t)
y2(t) = C2x(t) + N1fs(t)
(13.15)
where y2(t) ∈Rh and N1 ∈Rh×h are invertible.
To avoid the direct multiplication of the sensor and/or noise by the observer gain,
an augmented system state with output filter states is constructed. The filtered output
is given as follows:
˙w(t) = −Af w(t) + Af y2(t)
= −Af w(t) + Af C2x(t) + Af N1fs(t)
(13.16)
where −Af ∈Rh×h is any design matrix with stable eigenvalues.

The design of a TS-SMO for simultaneous actuator and sensor faults reconstruc-

loosely speaking, they must be respectively an upper bound on the magnitude of the

The objective now is to present robust SMO with two discontinuous terms for
reconstruct both actuator and sensor faults, as well as the T–S fuzzy system states. It
will be shown that the sufficient conditions for the stability with H∞performances
of the observer error (13.49) and (13.50) are established by using Lyapunov stability
and LMI techniques.

(13.63)
It is worth noting that ˜P in the new coordinate (13.41) has the quadratic form (13.43).
Therefore, the Lyapunov function can be rewritten as
V(t) = V1(t) + V2(t)

y (t) ˜P0ey(t)

asymptotically stable when ξ(x, u, t) = 0.
When ξ(x, u, t) ̸= 0, to attain the robustness of the proposed TS-SMO to the

V0(t) = ˙V(t) + rT(t)r(t) −μξ T(t)ξ(t)

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
The state estimation error ˜e(t) := col(˜e1(t), ey(t)) is stable on the sliding mode
surface (13.78), then ˜e1(t) is bounded a long T–S fuzzy system trajectories (13.17).
Thus, it has written, as a positive scalar ϖ, sup

∥˜e1(t)∥≤ϖ.
Remark 13.3. The effect of the system uncertainties ξ(t) on the estimation errors
(13.55) and (13.56) is decided by the value of μ. The accuracy of FE increases with
smaller value of μ. The minimization of μ can be found by solving the following LMI
optimization problem:
minimize(μ) subject to ˜P1 = ˜PT
1 > 0, ˜P0 = ˜PT
0 > 0 and (13.60)
(13.77)

such that the error systems can be driven to the sliding surface S which is defined as

(13.56) can be driven to the sliding surface given by (13.78) in finite time and remain
on it if the LMI optimization problem formulated in (13.60) is solvable and the gains
ηa and ηs satisfy

Proof. Consider the Lyapunov function Vs(t) = ˜eT
y (t) ˜P0ey(t). The time derivative of
Vs(t) can be obtained as
˙Vs(t) = eT
y (t)(˜AsT

Simultaneous actuator and sensor faults estimation
Assume the robust TS-SMO in the form of (13.19) has been designed, the objective
now is to simultaneously estimate actuator and sensor faults for T–S fuzzy system
(13.17). From Theorem 13.2, we know that an ideal sliding motion (13.78) will take
place after some finite time if the condition (13.79) is satisfied. During the sliding
motion, (13.56) becomes
0 = ˜A21(μ) ˜e1(t) + ˜D2(μ)ξ(t) + ˜M2(μ)fa(t) −υ1eq(t) + ˜N2fs(t) −υ2eq(t)

(13.91)
where υ1eq(t) and υ2eq(t) denote the equivalent output error injection signals which
are required to maintain a sliding motion. It can be approximated to any degree of
accuracy by replacing (13.51) and (13.52) with

Fault-tolerant controller design for T–S fuzzy systems
The goal of this section is to design an AFTC strategy based on robust FE of simulta-
neous actuator and sensor faults. The proposed strategy is able to guarantee stability
and ensure the robustness of the overall closed-loop system. A sufficient condition
is formulated via LMI to govern the performance of controller by assigning their
eigenvalues in specific LMI region of the complex plan. The proposed strategy uses
the T–S DOFC scheme [63,64] to compensate the effects of actuator and sensor faults
from the system inputs and outputs and to ensure the robustness against uncertainties.
Our controller is delivered by the corrected output which obtained by subtracting the
reconstructed sensor faults from the (faulty) outputs (see Figure 13.1).
ycorr(t) = Cx(t) + Nfs(t) −N ˆfs(t)
= Cx(t) + N
"
fs(t) −ˆfs(t)
#
(13.102)
where the quality of the fault compensation is determined by the quality of the FE,
i.e., whether the difference fs(t) −ˆfs(t) is close to zero. The T–S fuzzy model given in
(13.10) becomes
 ˙x(t) = A(μ)x(t) + B(μ)u(t) + M(μ)fa(t) + D(μ)ξ(t)
ycorr(t) = Cx(t) + Nefs(t)

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
Based on on-line FE, the T–S DOFC for T–S fuzzy models (13.10) is constructed as
follows:
 ˙xK(t) = AK(μ, μ)xK(t) + BK(μ)ycorr(t)
u(t) = CK(μ)xK(t) + DK(μ)ycorr(t) −K(μ)ˆfa(t)
(13.104)
where xK(t) ∈Rn×n is the controller state and ˆfa(t) is defined in (13.100). AK(μ, μ) ∈
Rn×n, BK(μ) ∈Rn×p, CK(μ) ∈Rm×n and DK(μ) ∈Rm×p are the T-SDOFTC matrices
to be designed, and

μiCK,i, DK(μ) =

(13.106)
Substituting (13.103) into (13.104), we obtain the dynamic of the closed-loop system
 ˙xK(t) = AK(μ, μ)xK(t) + BK(μ)Cx(t) + BK(μ)Nefs(t)
u(t) = CK(μ)xK(t) + DK(μ)Cx(t) + DK(μ)Nefs(t) −K(μ)ˆfa(t)
(13.107)
Combining u(t) in (13.107) with (13.103), we obtain
˙x(t) = A(μ)x(t) + B(μ)CK(μ)xK(t) + B(μ)DK(μ)Cx(t)
+ B(μ)DK(μ)Nefs(t) + B(μ)K(μ)ˆfa(t) −M(μ)fa(t)
+ D(μ)ξ(t)
(13.108)
The gain K(μ) is designed so that the effect of ˆfa(t) is either completely decoupled
from the closed-loop system. In [65], the authors have shown that if Im (M(μ)) ⊆
Im (B(μ)), then the decoupling is achieved by selecting K(μ) = B+(μ)M(μ) where
B+(μ) is the pseudoinverse of B(μ). Hence, K(μ) is considered a known gain in the
derivation of the LMI-based FTC design.
We further obtain
˙x(t) = A(μ)x(t) + B(μ)CK(μ)xK(t) + B(μ)DK(μ)Cx(t)
+ B(μ)DK(μ)Nefs(t) + M(μ)efa(t) + D(μ)ξ(t)
= (A(μ) + B(μ)DK(μ)C) x(t) + B(μ)CK(μ)xK(t)
+ B(μ)DK(μ)Nefs(t) + M(μ)efa(t) + D(μ)ξ(t)
(13.109)
where efa(t) = fa(t) −ˆfa(t) is the actuator FE error. From (13.103) and (13.107), the
following form is obtained
 xa(t) = Aa(μ, μ)xa(t) + Ea(μ, μ)ωa(t)
ycorr(t) = Caxa(t) + Daωa(t)

Here, we give an FTC design method in which the performances of the controller are
specified by a regional pole assignment and an H∞performance index. The fuzzy H∞
performance index is formulated as follows: given a scalar γK, determine an output
feedback fuzzy controller in the form of (13.104) such that
●
The closed-loop system described by (13.110) is asymptotically stable when
ωa(t) = 0.
●
Under zero-initial condition, the controlled output ycorr(t) satisfies
∥ycorr(t)∥2 < γK∥ωa(t)∥2, ∀ωa(t) ∈L2 [0, ∞), ωa(t) ̸= 0.
Theorem 13.3. The eigenvalues of Aa(μ, μ) are located in the disc region of the
negative complex plane characterized by radius(α), center(β) and the closed-loop
system (13.110) is stable with guaranteed H∞performance and with an attenuation
level γK, if there exist symmetric positive definite matrices X , Y ∈Rn×n and matri-
ces ˆAKij ∈Rn×n, ˆBKi ∈Rn×p, ˆCKi ∈Rm×n, ˆDKi ∈Rm×p (i, j = 1, . . . , k) such that the

(13.103) asymptotically stable with H∞performance bound γK. Thus, the proof is
complete.

ToillustratetheproposedAFTCstrategyencompassingthepossibilityofsimultaneous

in Section 13.2.2. The submodel matrices Ai, Bi(i = 1, 2) are given by

In order to point up the proposed approach, additional actuator and sensor faults are
used and are injected to the T–S model as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x(t) =
2
i=1
μi(ζ(t)) (Aix(t) + Bi(u(t) + ξ(t)) + Mifa(t))
y(t) = Cx(t) + Nfs(t)
(13.162)
It is assumed here that the actuator fault affects the system in the same direction as
the control input; therefore, Mi = Bi. Also, an additive cart position sensor fault has
been introduced and
N =
⎡
⎣
0
1
0
⎤
⎦
(13.163)
It can be easily shown that ∀i ∈[1, 2], (Ai, Mi, C) is minimum phase and rank(CMi) =
rank(Mi). It deserves to note that n > p ≥˜q, so the TS-SMO method presented in
Section 13.3.4 can be used for this system to achieve simultaneous actuator and sensor
faults estimation.

13.5.2
Simultaneous faults estimation design
Figure 13.5(a) is concerned with the actuator FE. It shows that the proposed TS-SMO
can reject the effects of system uncertainties successfully and accurately estimate
the actuator fault. Additive cart position sensor fault has been introduced to show
the ability of the proposed strategy to handle simultaneous faults. The sensor FE is
shown in Figure 13.5(b). It can be seen that despite the presence of uncertainties, the
proposed method could still track the sensor fault fs(t).

outputs with our proposed FTC. It can be noticed that the outputs without FTC do not
converge to the fault-free dynamic: it underlines that the system is perturbed by both
actuator and sensor faults, and it is not robust against such faults. The proposed T–S
fuzzy SMO under the FTC (13.107) makes the system robust against actuator and
sensor faults, since the outputs’trajectories of the system with FTC reach the outputs
of nominal model.

Conclusion
This chapter proposes a FTC scheme for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems
described by Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy representation. The aim of this FTC focuses
on the compensation of simultaneous actuator and sensor faults effects by using
a robust SMO technique. We present robust H∞faults reconstruction scheme for
T–S fuzzy system subject both to actuator, sensor faults and disturbances. An aug-
mented system has been constructed by assuming the sensor faults as an auxiliary

actuator faults. So that, the proposed TS-SMO with two discontinuous terms has
been performed by the search of suitable Lyapunov matrices in order to decouple
the simultaneous faults. The LMIs conditions have been formulated by using con-
vex optimization technique for minimizing the disturbance attenuation level. Finally,
simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in
this design framework. The extension of our work to FTC of T–S systems is under
study. The effectiveness of the proposed FTC approach to treat simultaneous faults is
illustrated by considering a parametric change position sensor and linear time-varying
fault frequencies on the cart actuator.

Chapter 14
LMI-based control design for balancing and
attitude stabilization of inverted pendulums
Magdi S. Mahmoud1
Abstract
This chapter explores the dynamic modeling and feedback stabilization of different
types of inverted pendulums (IPs). It contains a theoretical analysis of the system
dynamics and control methods, as well as a summary of MATLAB®/Simulink®
simulation results. There are two primary objectives of this chapter:
1.
To provide technical results pertaining to robust control-design approaches
using convex optimization methods over linear-matrix inequalities. The design
approaches include linear quadratic regulator (LQR), linear quadratic regulator
with integral gain (LQRI), model-predictive control, H2 control, H∞control and
multiobjective state feedback.
2.
To demonstrate the application of these approaches to the balancing and attitude
stabilization of IP systems including pendulums on cart, double and triple link
systems on pivot, rotational double IP and IP-type assistant robot.
14.1
Introduction
Over the past decades, inverted pendulum (IP) has been the subject of numerous
studies in control systems. An IP is a pendulum which has its links rotating above its
pivot point. The IP is a typical representative of a class of high-order nonlinear and
nonminimum phase systems. It is often implemented either
●
with the pivot point connected with a base arm that can rotate horizontally, as
described in [1] or
●
mounted on a cart that can move in a fixed horizontal line as introduced in [2].
The links of the pendulum are usually limited to one degree of freedom by affixing
the links to an axis of rotation. It is obvious that an IP is inherently unstable and must

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
be actively balanced in order to remain upright, while a normal pendulum is stable
when hanging downwards. This can be done by applying a torque at the pivot point
for a rotational IP as considered in this thesis or moving the pivot point horizontally
for the case of an IP on a cart. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point to
control the pendulum is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of
one’s finger.
The uniqueness and wide application of technology derived from this unstable
system have drawn interest of many researchers [3–7]. In recent years, researchers
have applied the idea of a mobile IP model to various applications including the design
of walking gaits for humanoid robots, robotic wheelchairs and personal transport
systems.
Controlling the IP is a classic problem in dynamics and system theory and is used
to verify the performance and demonstrating the effectiveness of control algorithms.
An IP without attached springs is essentially unstable, and it is hence obvious that
feedback of the state of the pendulum is needed to stabilize the pendulum. The IP
problem resembles the control systems that exist in robotic arms. The dynamics of IP
simulates the dynamics of robotic arm in the condition when the center of pressure
lies below the center of gravity (CoG) for the arm so that the system is also unstable.
Robotic arm behaves very much like IP under this condition.
The most familiar types of IP are the rotational single-arm pendulum [8], the cart
IP [9] and the double inverted pendulum (DIP) [10].The less common versions are the
rotational two-link pendulum [11], the parallel-type dual IP [12], the triple inverted
pendulum (TIP) [13], the quadruple IP [14] and the 3D or spherical pendulum [15].
An excellent survey is presented in [16].
In [17], a linearized model of two-wheeled mobile robot for balancing control
design was presented. A nonlinear model of same system was studied in [18]. By
developing a nonlinear observer to handle the nonlinear disturbance, recent results
were reported in [19]. Through an experimental verification, both linearized and
nonlinear models were treated in [20]. Employing an model-predictive control (MPC)
controller in [21], a design scheme was considered to guarantee balancing the robot.
The uncertainty plays a crucial role in robotic systems. Sources of uncertainty
include
●
Parametric due to changes in system elements such as friction, inertia or mass,
●
Environmental as a result of recording the robot output variable using sensor,
●
External due to variations in working loads.
The major task is how to handle these uncertainties without degrading the stability and
performance of the robot. This can be approached by generating proper and resilient
controllers.
A recently identified technique for overcoming the complications inherent in
wheeled inverted pendulum (WIP) systems is conveniently presented in [22,23]. Con-
trol problems involving different configurations of IPs have been considered by many
researchers. A comprehensive literature review of the topic is given in [24–32]. In
applications, two-wheeled robots (TWR) have two coaxial wheels mounted on either

LMI-based control design for balancing and attitude stabilization
349
side of an intermediate body, with a center of mass above the wheel axles and there-
fore must actively stabilize themselves to prevent toppling. TWR have a number of
advantages over other mobile robots. Although they are more difficult to control than
statically stable wheeled robots, TWRs are still much easier to control than legged
robots. This wheel configuration makes them highly maneuverable, because of their
ability to turn on the spot, similar to differential drive robots [33–44].
On a parallel development, the rotational double inverted pendulum (RDIP) takes
the classic rotational single pendulum problem to the next level of complexity. The
RDIP is composed of a rotary arm that attaches to a servo system which provides
a torque to the base arm to control the whole system, a short bottom rod connected
to the arm and a top long rod. It is an underactuated in the sense that it has fewer
inputs that degrees of freedom and extremely nonlinear unstable system due to the
gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the Coriolis and centripetal forces.
Since the RDIP presents considerable control-design challenges, it is an attractive tool
utilized for developing different control techniques and testing their performances.
Related applications include stabilizing the takeoff of a multistage rocket, as well as
modeling the human posture system [45–50].
Nearly, all works on pendulum control concentrate on two problems: stabilization
of the IPs and pendulums swing-up control design. The first topic is concerned with
the controller design to maintain the pendulum in the upright position. In the RDIP
case, controllers are designed to balance two vertical rods by manipulating the angle
of the base arm. The second one refers to an adequate algorithm to swing up the
pendulum from its stable equilibrium [51], the downward position to the upright
position.
In this chapter, we develop and establish complete control design results based
on several distinct approaches. We investigate issues regarding robust stability and
robust performance of control design for IPs. The controller design is based on an
approximate continuous-time linear model of the pendulum system subject to external
disturbance. The contributions of our work are summarized below:
1.
The analytical results are derived in systematic and unique way, thereby leading
to improved techniques over the techniques in the literature.
2.
All the design procedures are conveniently cast into the format of feasibility prob-
lem over linear-matrix inequalities (LMI). By this way, effective computational
methods are established yielding guaranteed quality solution.
3.
Simulation studies using Matlab/Simulink environment are performed for all the
approaches yielding good performance results.
The chapter is organized into two parts: The first part concerns dynamic model devel-
opment and occupies Sections 14.2–14.6. The second part composed of Sections 14.7
and 14.8 and focuses on the control design methods. Section 14.2 discusses basics
of dynamic modeling to characterize the behavior of the multilink system. In Sec-
tion 14.3, modeling issues pertaining to single and double pendulums on cart are
presented. DIP on pivot and TIP on pivot are provided in Section 14.4. The case of
RDIP is examined in Section 14.5. Finally, Inverted PENdulum Type Assistant Robot
(I-PENTAR) as a humanoid-type robot is the subject of Section 14.6. Turning to the

350

control side, linear control design methods are formulated in Section 14.7 as convex
optimization problems over LMIs. In Section 14.8, multiobjective state feedback is
treated. The chapter is concluded in Section 14.9 which summarizes the simulation
studies.
Notations: In the sequel, the Euclidean norm is used for vectors. We use W t and
W −1 to denote, respectively, the transpose and the inverse of any square matrix W.
We use W < 0 (≤0) to denote a symmetric negative definite (negative semidefinite)
matrix W. Opq, Ipq denote the p × q null and identity matrices, respectively. Let Tr[.]
denote the trace operator. Matrices, if their dimensions are not explicitly stated, are
assumed to be compatible for algebraic operations. In symmetric block matrices or
complex matrix expressions, we use the symbol • to represent a term that is induced
by symmetry.
14.2
Dynamic modeling
In this chapter, we visualize IP as a system of n rods that are isotropic, homogeneous
and conveniently connected. Such arrangement can be classified into two groups:
(a)
A nonlinear mechanical system of n IPs on a cart can be obtained by mounting
the IP on a stable and moving base. The n + 1 outputs are the cart position (m)
and pendulum angles (rad), and the system input is the force acting upon the
cart.
(b)
Employing ball bearings, we obtain a nonlinear mechanical system of n IPs
where the n outputs are the pendulum angles (rad), and the system inputs are
the input voltages at the motors at each joint.
The purpose of dynamic modeling is to characterize the behavior of the multilink
system. In the literature, there are two basic approaches to dynamic modeling:
1.
Using Euler–Lagrangian energy relations and
2.
Applying Newton’s second law and third law on every part of the system.
In this chapter, we focus on the first approach which suits control and systems appli-
cations. It has been pointed out that using the Lagrangian approach eventually leads
to effective formulation of multilink system dynamics. The mathematical models for
different types of IPs [25] are frequently derived via Lagrange equations:
dq
dt
∂L
∂˙qj
−∂L
∂qj
+ ∂D(t)
∂qj
= Q(t)
(14.1)
where
●
qj stands for a particular generalized coordinates,
●
T and V represent the system kinetic and potential energy, respectively,
●
L
= T −V is the Lagrange function,
●
Q(t) is the vector of generalized external forces acting upon the system and
●
D(t) (Rayleigh, dissipation function) expresses the viscous (friction) forces.

The use of Lagrange mechanics therefore transforms the process of deriving the
motion equations of the IPs system into the determination of kinetic, potential and
dissipation energies related to the cart and all pendulums. Using well-known formulas,
general relations that describe the energetic balances of the cart and jth pendulum in
an IP systems were derived and can be found in [31].
In what follows, we deal with IPs without friction forces, that is, D(t) ≡0.
14.3
Pendulums on cart
In this section, we begin looking at the dynamic models that belong to the first group.
14.3.1
Single pendulum on cart
By setting n = 1, we obtain the single inverted pendulum (SIP) system (Figure 14.1,
left), which encompasses two subsystems:
S1:
The cart subsystem:
(m0 + m1) ¨θ0(t) + δ0 ˙θ0(t) + 1
2m1ℓ1( ¨θ1(t) cos θ1(t) −˙θ 2
1 (t) sin θ1(t)) = F(t)
(14.2)
S2:
The pendulum subsystem:
J1 ¨θ1(t) + δ1 ˙θ1(t) + 1
2m1ℓ1( ¨θ0(t) cos θ1(t) −1
2m1gℓ1 sin θ1(t)) = 0
(14.3)
where m0 is the cart mass, m1 is the pendulum mass, ℓ1 is the pendulum length, δ0
is the friction coefficient of the cart against the surface, δ1 is the damping constant
of the pendulum, F(t) is the applied force and J1 = 1
3m1ℓ2
1 is the single pendulum’s
moment of inertia with respect to the pivot.

Double pendulums on cart
The case of n = 2 yields the mathematical model of the DIP system (Figure 14.1,

1 (t) sin(θ1(t) −θ2(t)))
−1
2(m1 + m2)gℓ2 sin(θ2(t)) = 0
(14.6)
14.3.3
State-space representation
It is readily evident that, based on Lagrange’s formulation, a set of nonlinear differen-
tial equations describing the IP system dynamics can be obtained. With appropriate
definitions, a nonlinear state-space model of the form can be produced:
˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) + g(x(t), u(t), w(t))
(14.7)
y(t) = Cx(t)
(14.8)
Seeking to design balancing and/or attitude controllers, a linearized model about a
stable pendulum position is used. For sufficiently small angles and angular velocities,
an effective quasilinearization procedure gives the following model:
˙x(t) = A x(t) + Bu(t) + w(t)
(14.9)
y(t) = C x(t)
(14.10)
where x(t) ∈Rn, u(t) ∈Rm, y(t) ∈Rp, w(t) ∈Rq are the state, the control input,
the measured output and the external disturbance, respectively.

In what follows, we examine the linearized continuous-time dynamic models of
IPs without cart in terms of generalized relative coordinates.

In this section, we examine two cases: DIP on pivot and TIP on pivot. In both cases,
we present representative values for the purpose of computer simulation.

14.4.2 TIP on pivot
Stabilization of a TIP is developed along similar lines to the double pendulum. A
schematic diagram for the triple pendulum is shown in Figure 14.2(right). Two direct
current (DC) motor/gearboxes are used to provide torques to the upper and middle
pendulum hinges, while the lower hinge is free to rotate. In this case, we only consider
attitude control of the middle link, while the upper link is kept in alignment with the
middle one. This alignment is achieved by proportional position feedback applied to

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
14.5
Rotational double inverted pendulum
The RDIP takes the classic rotational single pendulum problem to the next level of
complexity [1]. The RDIP is composed of a rotary arm that attaches to a servo system
which provides a torque to the base arm to control the whole system, a short bottom
rod connected to the arm and a top long rod. It is an underactuated (that is, it has fewer
inputs that degrees of freedom) and extremely nonlinear unstable system due to the
gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the Coriolis and centripetal forces.
Since the RDIP presents considerable control-design challenges, it is an attractive tool
utilized for developing different control techniques and testing their performances.
Related applications include stabilizing the takeoff of a multistage rocket, as well as
modeling the human posture system [26,27].
A simple mathematical model has been presented in [45], which assumes that the
acceleration of the base arm is able to be manipulated directly and therefore chosen
as the system control input. In this dissertation, a more practical assumption is taken
under which the torque of the motor to the base arm is the control signal. Moreover,
the pivoting friction factors will be taken care for the goal to build a more precise
model and simulate the real system we have in the lab.
We will use some additional basic assumptions of the system attributes similar
with [45]:
A1
All the link angles and the angular velocities are accessible at each time step,
since we know that we can access these data with the help of the encoders on the
links, and high rate of data acquisition is possible for our experiment platform.
A2
The viscous frictions of the arm and the two pendulums are considered, while
the static friction, backlash and plane slackness are ignored.
A3
The apparatus is light weight and has low inertia resulting in a structure with
low stiffness and a tendency to vibrate.
A4
System dynamics is slow enough to be controlled.
Figure 14.3 shows the basic configurations of the RDIP. The arrows on the arcs
show the positive direction for the rotary movement of the links. The straight dash
lines denote the origin of the displacement of the link angles. For example, when the
horizontal Link 1 is centered, and the vertical Links 2 and 3 are in the upright position,
all of the position variables are zero. The state variables and related parameters of the
links are listed in Table 14.4.
The Euler–Lagrange (E–L) method, introduced in details in [28], is applied in the
derivation of the equations of motion for the RDIP dynamics, since the Newtonian
approach of applying Newton’s laws of motion is highly complicated in this case. The
solutions to the E–L equation for the action of a system are capable of describing
the evolution of a physical system according to the Hamilton’s principle of stationary
action in Lagrangian mechanics. In classical mechanics, it is equivalent to Newton’s
laws of motion, but it has the advantage that it takes the same form in any system of
generalized coordinates, and it is better suited to generalizations.
For the purpose of modeling, the RDIP works as follows. The movement of
the arm on the base, Link 1, is constrained to the x–o–z plane and rotating around

to control the system and is described in [29]. Here, we will not discuss the servo
system. Therefore, the control input of the RDIP is the torque applied to Link 1. The
control objective is to maintain the pendulums Link 2 and 3 in the upright position
with Link 1 in the origin position.

Inverted pendulum-type assistant robot
Referring to Figure 14.4, the I-PENTAR is constructed to exhibit human motion. It
consists of a body with a waist joint, arms designed for safety and a WIP mobile plat-
form. It is capable to perform heavy tasks [36,37]. From a control systems standpoint,
I-PENTARisdepictedasathree-dimensionalrobot; withcontrolsofinclinationangle,
horizontal position and steering angle to achieve high mobile capability. Generally
speaking, the robot dynamics is derived considering the nonholonomic constraint of
the two-wheeled mobile robot. As such I-PENTAR is unstable, thus achieving the
closed-loop stability is crucial for controller design.

Balancing robot was reported in [33] using a linearized model and in [38] based
on nonlinear model. Accommodation of the nonlinear disturbance based on a non-
linear observer was presented in [39]. In [40], a particular robot with movable two
wheels was constructed and evaluated. A model-predictive controller was reported in
[21] to balance the robot. A fuzzy control approach in [41,42] dealt with parametric
uncertainties. A robust controller was proposed by [43] using a model-based sliding
mode theory. For motion tracking in [44], a reference model for the yaw and tilt angle
was constructed using the LQR optimization. Trajectory tracking control was treated
in [47] using uncertain model. A backstepping-based adaptive control is designed
in [48] to achieve output tracking for the WIP and similarly an adaptive integral back-
stepping controller is developed in [?] to stabilize the body angle. Design aspects for
WIP platforms were examined in [50] to investigate the effect of design choices on
balancing the performance.
Figure 14.4 shows a schematic of I-PENTAR. It has two arms with one elbow for
each arm, two gyro sensors specified to define the acceleration and the inclination
angle relative to the flat surface of the earth and two wheels are for movements in two
degree of freedom.

LMI-based control-design methods
In this section, we develop linear control methods and formulate the design as convex
optimization problems over LMIs.The common design objective is to stabilize system
(14.10).Allthesubsequentanalyticaltreatmentareinspiredbytheresultsof[53]–[56].
The methods established hereafter are categorized into five problems:
●
Linear quadratic control (LQR) design, where the objective is to determine a
state-feedback gain in the nominal case (without the disturbance input). This is
termed as Problem I.
●
Linear quadratic integral control (LQRI) design, in which, we expand the state
model by including the integral of the deviation of the output in the absence of
disturbance. This is termed as Problem II.

In control system terminology, the problem under consideration is that of deter-
mining feedback controller that makes system (14.10) stable over a wide range of
operation while achievingaprescribedperformancemeasure. Next, weprovidedesign
techniques to achieve this goal.
14.7.1
LQR: proportional gain
With focus on the LQR design, we look at LMI-based formulation. The associated
cost function is
J =
 ∞
0
[yT(t)Qy(t) + uT(t)Ru(t)]dt
(14.39)
where 0 < Q, 0 < R are output error and control weighting matrices. In what follows,
we proceed to determine a linear optimal state-feedback control u = Lx that derives
system (14.10) with  ≡0 while minimizing the quadratic cost (14.39). Assume that
a Lyapunov functional V(x) has the properties:
●
V(x) = xTMx,
M > 0,
●
There exists γ+ > 0 such that xT
o Mxo ≤γ+
●
˙V(x) ≤−[xTC TQC x + uTRu]

362
The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
Then, the linear system controlled by u is asymptotically stable and J∞≤V(xo).
With u = Lx, the inequality of the derivative of the Lyapunov functional becomes
xT[M(A + BL) + (A + BL)TM T]x ≤−xT[C TQC + LTRL]x
(14.40)
Inequality (14.40) is satisfied for all x ̸= 0, if there exists L and M such that
M(A + BL) + (A + BL)TM T + [CTQC + LTRL] ≤0
(14.41)
Proceeding to minimize the upper bound on the cost xT
o Mxo, the under consideration
for given γ+ can be cast into
min
γ+,K,L γ+
subject to (14.41)
(14.42)
To convexify the above problem, we first express (14.41) as

 =
⎡
⎣

⎦≤0
(14.43)
Pre- and postmultiply (14.43) by diag{Y, I, I} and using Y = M −1, S = LK−1,
it follows that (14.43) is equivalent to

When a feasible solution of problem (14.46) is attained, we get L = SY −1, M = Y −1.
14.7.2
LQRI: proportional-integral gain
Next, a modified formulation of the LQR (14.46) is considered with an additional
cost-term representing the integral of the deviation of the output from its initial state

¯M > 0,
●
There exists γ+ > 0 such that ηT

●
˙V(η) ≤−[ηT ˜Qη + uT ˜Ru]
Then, the linear system controlled by u is asymptotically stable and J∞≤˜V(xo).

at the convex problem

Considering system (14.10) and to penalize the effect of the disturbance, we include

Multiobjective state feedback
Reference is made to Figure 14.5 where P(s), K designate the linearized plant and
the state-feedback gain, respectively. Denoting by T∞(s) and T2(s) the closed-loop
transfer functions from w →z∞and from w →z2, respectively, our goal is to design
a state-feedback control law that meets one of the following objectives:
●
H2 control design, in which, it is required to maintain the H2-norm of T2(s)
below some prescribed value ν > 0,
●
H∞control design, it is required to maintain the H∞-norm of T∞(s) below some
prescribed value γ > 0,
●
Mixed control design, in which, it is required to minimize an H2/H∞trade-off
criterion of the form α||T∞(s)||2
∞+ β||T2(s)||2
2.
In the sequel, we conveniently imbed the linearized model (14.10) into the form:
˙x(t) = A x(t) + Bu(t) + w(t)
(14.81)
z∞(t) = G x(t) + S u(t) + w(t)
(14.82)
z2(t) = C x(t) + Du(t) + w(t)
(14.83)
with z∞(t) ∈Rq. z2(t) ∈Rq as the performance outputs. We focus on the stabilization
problem under state feedback u = Kx where the closed-loop system is given by
˙xs(t) = Asxs(t) + w(t)
(14.84)
z∞(t) = Gsx(t) + w(t)
(14.85)
z2(t) = Csx(t) + w(t)
(14.86)

Treated separately,
our three design objectives have the following LMI
formulations.
14.8.1
H2 performance
Here, the closed-loop H2-norm of T2(s) does not exceed some prescribed value ν > 0,
if there exist two symmetric matrices 0 < X2 and Q such that

Denoting the optimal solution by (X∗, Q∗, ν∗), the corresponding state-feedback
gain is given by K∗= Q∗(X∗)−1.
14.8.2
H∞performance
Here, we consider minimizing the closed-loop RMS norm from w →z∞X2 and Q
does not exceed γ , if and only if there exists a symmetric matrix 0 < X∞such that

gain is given by K∗= Y∗(X∗)−1.
14.8.3
Mixed H2/H∞performance
Finally, we consider minimizing a trade-off criterion of the form α||T∞(s)||2

Denoting the optimal solution by (X∗, Y∗, Q∗, γ ∗), the corresponding state-
feedback gain is given by K∗= Y∗(X∗)−1, and this gain guarantees the worst case
performances:

Note that K∗does not yield the globally optimal trade-off in general due to the
conservatism assuming a single Lyapunov matrix [54].

Simulation results
In this section, we aim to provide representative and meaningful simulation
results of applying the different feedback control algorithms to different pendulum
configurations. In computer implementation, we made use of [52].
14.9.1
SIP–DIP open-loop response
The analysis of the open-loop dynamical behavior of both the SIP and DIP systems
is presented. The dynamics of SIP system is analyzed for two groups of parameters
at once:
[Group I:] m0 = 0.3 kg, m1 = 0.275 kg, ℓ1 = 0.5 m, δ0 = 0.3 kg s−1, δ1 =
0.01148 kg m2 s−1
[Group II:] m0 = 0.1 kg, m1 = 1.0 kg, ℓ1 = 0.8 m, δ0 = 0.3 kg s−1, δ1 =
0.1 kg m2 s−1
For the DIP system, the parameters are
m0 = 0.3 kg, m1 = 0.275 kg, m2 = 0.275 kg, ℓ1 = 0.5 m, ℓ2 = 0.5 m, δ0 =
0.3 kg s−1, δ1 = 0.1 kg m2 s−1, δ2 = 0.1 kg m2 s−1
The impulse response of both SIP and DIP systems are displayed in Figures 14.6
and 14.7.

Remark 14.2. We observe from Figures 14.6 and 14.7 that each pendulum of the
system passes through oscillatory transient state until the system reaches the stable
equilibrium point in which all pendulums are pointing downward. The backward
impact of the pendulum/pendulums on the cart, which increases with the weight of
the load, is also visible. The simulation results confirm the generally known empirical
observations of pendulum behavior. The simulation results in Figures 14.8 and 14.9
reveal that both tracking control and LQR algorithms perform reasonably well. The
ability to control the SIP system with respect to the all requirements was demonstrated

Considering Figure 14.1 and using the following data m0 = 1.5 kg, m1 =
0.5 kg, m2 = 0.75 g, ℓ1 = 0.5 m, ℓ2 = 0.75 m, the state-space matrices are given by

We perform a MATLAB simulation based on the result of Problem I with Q =
diag [5, 50, 50, 20, 700, 700], R = 1. The ensuing results for a relatively small
deflections from the equilibrium are plotted in Figure 14.10. For larger deflections
toward the same direction, the state trajectories are depicted in Figure 14.11.
TurningtotheapplicationofMPC,usingZOHwithsamplingperiodTs = 0.002 s,
we obtain the discrete-time model of the type (14.65). The simulation results based
on the solution of Problem V are displayed in Figures 14.12 and 14.13 for the cases
of small and large deflections, respectively.
Remark 14.3. Looking at Figures 14.10 and 14.11, it can be readily seen that the
system can be balanced, although the cart is stabilized far from the point 0, to which
it returns to with a very low pace. From Figures 14.12 and 14.13, we observe that the
lower pendulum has for a time period a large angular velocity.

The pendulum links are made of 50-mm-diameter plastic tube which is relatively
rigid, cheap, easy to cut and weighs 0.343 kg/m. At both ends of each link, alu-
minum components (3 mm in thickness) are attached to provide the structures for
mounting sensors and actuators. The lower hinge consists of a steel shaft mounted
on ball bearings. At one end of the shaft, a potentiometer is mounted to measure the
angle of the lower link, while at the other end, a small DC tacho is used to mea-
sure angular velocity. The hinges for the middle and upper links are split into two
independent (suitably aligned) sections. One section is a short steel shaft mounted
on ball bearings and attached to a potentiometer which measures the relative angle
between adjacent links. The second section is the output shaft of a DC motor/gearbox.
Planetary gearboxes with a rated continuous load capacity of 4.5 Nm were chosen.

RDIP simulation
The RDIP experiment platform used for simulation consists of a horizontal base arm
(denoted as Link 1) driven by a servo motor and two vertical pendulums (denoted as
Links 2 and 3) that move freely in the plane perpendicular to Link 1, as shown in Figure
14.3. Since we will focus on the stabilization of the pendulums, it is convenient to set
the coordinate system as in Figure 14.3. In this chapter, the mathematical model of the
RDIP will be developed by the use of the E–L function. A simple mathematical model
was presented in [45], which assumes that the acceleration of the base arm is able to be
manipulateddirectlyandthereforechosenasthesystemcontrolinput.TheRDIPsimu-
lation results using LQR and its tuned version are depicted in Figures 14.16 and 14.17.
14.9.6
I-PENTAR simulation
For the purpose of simulation and with reference to Figure 14.4, I-PENTAR adopts
convenient set of a double motor method for mobile actuation. The robot body
composed of two parts (lower and upper), a waist joint and a rate gyro sensor. In
addition, a wheel-type roller adheres to the tip of the arm. In Figure 14.18, the inter-
nal signal flow of I-PENTAR is depicted. The control and sensor signals between
each part and CPU board are interfaced via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
board in 1-ms sampling time. The two angular velocity values, analog and digital,
from the rate gyro sensor are merged and integrated to be used for an inclination angle
of the lower body.
In order to evaluate using the stabilization methods of LQR, LQRI, H2 and
H∞, balancing experiments, which are considered one of the fundamental mobile
motions of a WIP mobile robot, are conducted with I-PENTAR. In the experiments,
I-PENTAR takes an upright-standing posture stretching its waist and extending its
arms toward the ground. The position of CoG of the whole body, which is used for

Figure 14.21
Comparison of output trajectories
defining the robot’s inclination angle, is calculated by a geometrical method based
on the parameter values of each part.
The ensuing results are depicted in Figures 14.19 and 14.20 for the two output
variables: the robot forward movement and the robot inclined angle. In Figure 14.21,
a comparison among the design methods is presented.
From the simulation results, we can arrive at the following points:
●
Smooth behavior are clearly demonstrated for the patterns of the output variables,
●
The LQR design determines one gain matrix for the feedback control, while the
LQRI design determines two gain matrices: one for the control and the other for
the integral state.

The inverted pendulum in control theory and robotics
14.10
Conclusions
In this chapter, we have provided complete analytical results pertaining to dynamic
modeling, control design and computer simulation of IP systems. The dynamic
modeling covers different cases span from SIP to rotational and WIPs. The control
design focused on the development of convex optimization over linear-LMI to yield
linear controllers based on various criteria. Finally, MATLAB simulation experiments
are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods.
